1,Brother Bear...in Ireland,"Not a very clever storyline, basically the movie Brother Bear (Disney) without the funny moose.Pixar junkies give me a hard time about describing it like that, but they all say the same thing: ""Yeah, but Pixar wasn't working on the story, they were working on HAIR in this movie!""Well, she does have hair. Big hair. But I thought they did hair pretty well in Monsters Inc. And if you're really worried about getting good hair, don't pick a huge mass of red curls (that's going to look animated just because it's outrageously red), pick slightly curled brown hair that reacts the the moisture in the air by frizzing halfway through the day.Not much storywise, not a compelling plot, very predictable. Maybe good for kids? I don't know, probably a little scary. A lot of angry bears."
1,never watched,it never download so i can watch with the time i rented it for.. so i cant tell u if its good or not
5,"For every mother, daughter, and/or Warrior","I don't enjoy every box office hit animated movie, but I thoroughly enjoyedBrave. The ending theme may be about bravery, but the story is rich in family relationship and in choosing who you are, who you want to be and how you treat others. It's a great movie to take your kids to see with you."
3,Okay,I like the idea of family. The characters were great. I would have loved to see a better story line.
3,"Not a bag movie, but Pixar has done better","Its good story, albeit a little short.Worth watching if not only to see more of the Pixar catalog. Sidenote: Billy Connolly is hilarious in anything he's in."
2,"Lots of Drama, Little Humor","The animation is beautiful! It was a joy to watch. My expectation from the previews was that this would have the same level of wit and humor as Shrek, but I did not find myself laughing out loud. The three kings and their suitor sons are such caricatures that they don't even seem to fit into the otherwise quirky, but normal, cast."
3,Predictable,"This movie has great animation and cute, but predictable story line. Just another glossy kids movie. I give it three stars. It passed the time."
5,Love it!,"The whole family loves this movie, despite the whole magic part of it, that can get a little scary for the littles. It is a great movie that has a beautiful redemptive way of restoring relationship (a first for Disney) between mother and daughter."
2,Terrible.,This is not a typical pixar film. It's like Beauty and the Beast + the Little Mermaid + some other new age hippie film I can't think of. I actually regretted watching this which I have never said about any Pixar film.
4,Great movie with a great family message,"I started watching this in 3D, but it turned out the disc was messed up and I had to send it back to be replaced.No problems with Amazon. They replaced it very quickly.I finished watching the movie on just regular Blu-ray with no issues, and it was great.I don't think it was Pixar's greatest story, but still a beautiful movie.I'm torn between four and five stars. I go with 4 because, although I love Pixar and Disney, and the story had a great message and was beautifully delivered as usual; an overall look at the story left me thinking it could have been a little better."
3,Blu-ray disc has a defect,"I ordered this collector's edition for my daughter for Christmas. The DVD plays well and we love the movie (we saw it in the theater last summer). However, the blue-ray disc (""regular"", not the 3-D version) has a spot in it where the movie gets ""stuck"". I thought it was just a glitch with the blu-ray disc, so I returned the entire collection for another one (which arrived quickly - kudos to Amazon!). I was disgusted when the ""new"" blu-ray had the exact same problem. Apparently the companies who manufacture these products don't care about the quality. I will be contacting Disney/Pixar directly to complain about the fact that they mass-produced an inferior product. I still gave the collection 3 stars since the DVD and the ""extras"" all play well and we truly love the movie - and Amazon's shipping was fantastic!"
4,Not Pixar's Best But Still A Wonderful Tale,"I didn't feel like this was the best movie ever put out by Pixar but considering their track record, is still a compliment. I was a bit surprised by the naked butts in one scene. It seemed more like humor one would find in a Dreamworks production. The tale of a teenage daughter becoming more independent and the complex relationship it causes with her mother, is a tale as old as time."
2,what this is it?,"- sorry to say, but the story line was weak, and I am not a girl having (teenage) issues with my mother to be able to relate to this one. Regardless who was the target audience, is this really made so that there's a first major female character done by Pixar? What about pre-teen kids? It felt as if too many categories and groups of people were supposed to be covered (somehow) and it did not work out, as it always does with trying to be commercial and appropriate...."
3,Bad Quality At First,"The quality of the video was bad for the first 20-30 minutes of it; it would skip and freeze and the image was very blurry. But after a while of letting it run and buffer, it became more clear and smooth."
3,I'm sure the kids will love it,"I loved the beginning and the end, but was a tad bored with everything else. But I'm sure the kids will love it. The animation and the colors were top notch."
2,A Great Looking Movie,"There was very little about this movie to like beyond its exemplary look. Brave didn't hit the necessary buttons that makes one say...Yeah, I know it's a kid movie but I like it, too."
4,"Good Movie, Not Pixar's Best","This was a good movie, but it didn't move me like all of PIXAR's past movies. Don't get me wrong, it is top notch. I don't think those guys are capable of making a bad movie. The plot just didn't seem quite as intuitive and heart-moving as I've come to expect and love from PIXAR movies."
4,Wife enjoyed it.,"The film was a bit too 'familiar' at times for me, but generally well done. My wife really enjoyed it."
4,shortfalls,"story line not as good as UP, kids probably didn't notice. every thing else, done well.needed a better side kick"
3,a movie without a theme,"Visually, ""Brave"" is stunning, with the usual excellent soundtrack and voices expected of such movies these days. But what's it about? Damned if I know.The heroine is a willful, capable young woman who can outride, outshoot and outthink nearly everyone she comes in contact with. Her mother annoys her, however, so what does she do? She seeks out a witch, who transforms her mother into a non-speaking bear. Then what happens? A bunch of stuff that doesn't really amount to a hill of beans.Maybe I just didn't get ""Brave"", because I'm not a kid. But I've loved nearly every other CGI animated movie of this type, and this one left me cold. If you're looking for a saga of a young woman using her heroic gifts and achieving great things, I believe you'll be disappointed. I frankly think ""Tangled"" is a better movie involving billowing hair."
4,A Disney Movie Parents can Approve of and Kids Still Enjoy,This is a good option for parents looking for a return to childrens movies which have a moral to the story and limited influence from pop culture. I put it on for three children aged 3 to 6 with no complaints. The wife later watched it on her own. No complaints here.
3,Kind of disappointed!,"While the animation is striking, it is kind of dark material and the accents the characters have can make it hard to understand to a child. I am not saying the movie was bad, but I think the animators focused to much on how everyone's hair looked and moved and not enough on the content. I have said this before, but this movie couldn't hold a candlestick next to movies like Paranorman, which is a little dark, but you kind of know that by the title. Brave is a nice little movie, but it is forgettable."
2,"Wow, LET DOWN","I thought this movie was pretty bad. Especailly for a Disney movie. It got such great reviews, but I found I was just bored with it. I think it could have been way better. I laughed once, maybe twice. I like the idea, but it just fell flat, so very flat..."
5,Loved this movie and so did the kids.,The preview of this movie does not even begin to show how funny this movie was. Mom and Dad loved this as much as the kids did. I would watch this again.
4,Brave,Enjoyed the whole set up of this movie. Turned out a little different than expected. Loved the acquences and the enviroment that was placed fit quite nice.
3,Brave Movie,"The quality of the film was wonderful as expected, but the storyline left much to be desired. In comparison to other princess type movies Brave didn't satisfy. Not a movie I will willingly watch over and over. I bought it as a Christmas present for my 4 year old granddaughter who also received Tangled and Cinderella. I know out of those 3 it would be my 3rd choice to watch."
3,Not what I would expect from Pixar,"This is clearly just another Disney Princess addition. Not sure I would put ""Pixar"" on the cover of this one. The animated short ""La Luna"" is clearly something I would consider Pixar quality but not this movie.The animation was well done but the story just was not that engaging."
3,Meh... I'm probably too old for this one,"Great visuals, as expected from a Pixar production. Story line isn't so great, writing not so great and it gets really slow at times. I had to force myself to watch it in one sitting. The Irish accents made it hard for me to understand at times, but I managed. A better decision for me would have been to rent this one, not buy it.Younger folks may respond to this movie more positively than me."
2,Huh?,I could not be any more disappointed in this movie. It was terrible and had the plot was completely bizarre. Not at all what I expected from the previews.
2,most disappointing pixar movie,"this movie seemed more like a disney movie than what i expect from a pixar movie. even by disney movie standards, it was poor. the story was very weak. I kept waiting for the movie to get to some sort of adventure or point and by then it was already over."
3,"Excellent graphics, poor story",The graphics were excellent. The story fell short. I lost interest when the mother turned into a bear. That's all.
2,"Visuals: Stunning, Plot: Tired, Funny: Not","The title pretty much says it tall. Characters are all exceptionally cliched archetypes, paper-thin and 100% predictable. Not a single laugh-out-loud moment. Overall, a very formulaic effort."
5,Something different,This movie is one that the entire family watches (a lot) and enjoys. We like it because it is something a little different from other cartoons that are out. The main character inspires us all to be BRAVE!
3,Good family film,Good to watch once. Not the best film Pixar has made but not to bad. The three boys are my favorite.
3,Movie ok But video quality sucked.,As great as the movie seemed my children got bored with the size of the picture. For some reason we were unable to enlarge it so that we could truly enjoy the film.I tried to tell Amazon and I have not heard back from them except for an email requesting me to write a review.
3,ENJOYED IT1,"CHILDRENGREAT ANIMATION AND INTERESTING PLOT.A GOOD DISNEY FLICK,SUITABLE FOR WATCHING WITHYOUN GER FAMILY MEMBERS. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE"
5,Ok but maybe you can wait for it on cable,the movie starts off with a major serious tone. a family movie with serious tones.but later it makes a move for the slightly better atleast for the more funny..reminding me of the oldDisney film ... Brother Bear.. it's definatly not Pixar's best effort but it's better than a lot of other crap outthere by other studios live action or animated... but be aware there are some butt shots. kids might find itfunny. adults found it shocking...
3,"Strong visuals and soundtrack, weakness in overall idea execution","The idea and themes of the film are strong, but the overall execution of the story has many weak places and points that cause the watcher to go ""wait a sec..."". Many of these could have been easily fixed with a ten-second shot or one line but were not. I won't give examples, so as not to spoil anything for those who still want to see it. As I said to my husband, ""I'd certainly be happy to have our daughter see it, but I won't make any push to expose her to it or buy it since it just isn't what I've come to expect from something with Pixar's name on it."""
3,Eh - it was fine.,"My 9 year old daughter loved it...and I guess that is what matters. I found it boring, nothing about the story kept me interested."
2,"Movie was fine, streaming was poor.","I'd give the movie a 3.5. I give the Amazon streaming service, with the recurring stalls and re-starts, a 1.5."
2,Meh.,"I've seen every Pixar film but Cars 2 and this was easily Pixar's weakest effort. It's story we've all heard too many times to put any original spin on it but even Pixar's typical twist where the story is told through toys, cars, wildlife, robots, etc was missing. It will be the only Pixar film that doesn't end up in my house on DVD."
4,Good Pixar Movie,Good mother/daughter story with strong characters. The animation was amazing. It was a little scary at time for our 5 year old.
4,"Excellent, But Some Adult Humor","Excellent Pixar installment. Story line wasn't geared to the animated age group. Clean adult humor, and some not suitable for small children."
4,CANT GO WRONG WITH DISNEY,"WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE MOVIE 5 STARS, IT MADE ME CRY. WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE A MOVIE THAT DOS NOT MAKE A GROWN MAN CRY?"
5,Great tale,Great animation. Excellent story. Lots of fun for the whole family. The crowd scenes are filled with great quips that the adults will appreciate.
5,Cute,It was a really cute movie with tid bits of comedy that just the adults will get mixed in here and there.Would rent again.
5,Cute Movie,I really liked this movie. Good for all ages! Great for family nights in. I would buy it if i could!
2,Mother and brothers turn into bears? What???,"""Santa"" gave this to my 6-year old daughter for Christmas and I was really looking forward to watching it with her. What a load of garbage. I am absolutely miffed. I mean I loved Tangled, The Incredibles, The Little Mermaid, etc. What does getting a witch to turn your mother into a bear have to do with archery and being BRAVE? So stupid. My husband and I would like the 1 1/2 hrs returned to us. Ugh. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because my daughter thought it was fun."
2,Weird storyline,"Not my favorite Pixar movie, usually the story lines are much better. I could have done with out this one."
5,The whole family loved it!,"We watched it together, and the kids have watched it a couple of times on their own. Great family film!"
4,"Boys like this movie, too","This is not just a chick-flick Disney movie. Plenty of bashing and breaking of things. My boys, 10, 14 and 17 liked it."
4,Stunning animation and a great message!,"Loved it. Great message for young girls to be strong, independent young women... But always respect your mother! It's nice to see a challenge such as mother and daughter in teen years learning to listen and love one another."
3,"Good story, not very exciting","I was excited about seeing this movie when i saw the previews. Buy after seeing it i felt let down. The animation was great and the story was good, but it just felt like it was lacking something. I didn't feel a connection with the characters and it moved a little slow. I would recommend this movie to others, but i personally can't give it more than 3 stars."
5,Love it!!!!,This is a very good movie!! My kids love this movie!!! My husband even watched this with us and he is not into the kids movies!!! I give this 5 stars!
4,Amazing Animation and Classic Story for Children,Brave is a great classic tale with current era twist. My children loved this movie. PIXAR once again proves that great storytelling is still possible.
5,LOVE this movie!,"We saw this at the show and we loved it. We pre-ordered it and have watched it over and over. The one bear was a bit scary for our 5yr old grandson who we do not let see most movies, but after he saw the story through, he was good with it.Can't say enough about how much we love it."
4,WELL DONE!,Great characters and beautifully done! The whole family enjoyed it and we will buy it used when the price comes down a little.
5,"Excellently made, entertaining with a moral to the story. The plot isn't original, but it's good.","I love this movie. Fantasy, happy endings, comedy, and a lesson. Good for young girls just exhibiting rebellion. I'm 55 years old, but the kid in me is alive and well. I tend to be nonobjective when it comes to Disney and Pixar animations. I don't think I have seen two or three I didn't like. It brings back the wonder and excitement of a full, wonderful life ahead, where it's possible to achieve most anything, and be the master of your fate."
4,brave,brave- movie was well done and carried a message for all adults and children- good photography and realistic message -helpful for young adults also
5,brave review,"Excellent portrayal of a strong,confident and capable young lady.I loved this movie because it doesn't follow the typicalstereotypes of many movies for kids,showing girls as divas,helpless,wanna-be princesses and ultra feminine or tough-as-nails mean,cruel and ultra masculine."
5,Fantastic!!!,Disney does it again with another movie that will be passed down generation to generation. Family friendly and overall a great movie.
5,gift,"I bought this a gift for a five year old for Christmas. it was just what she wanted., i may have to get one for myself"
4,Fun story with a lesson,"This is a good story, a bit on the dark side, but ultimately a happy ending; as good animation should be."
4,Good for Kids,"Good story, I like it for the kids. i like it for the kids. i like it more for the kids. to many words required for review. I was a disney movie for god's sake. What do you expect?"
4,Pleasant Disney with a strong willed heroine,Picked this for my granddaughter to offset the Barbie syndrome. Girls can be athletic and beautiful without being blond or buxom.
4,Great entertainment,Well made movie with catchy dialogue and funny accents . My kids and the adults loved this one equally. Typical fantasy fare though.
5,good movie,I love that the princess is kind of tomboyish and questions why she has to do things the way her parents did.
1,Think Barbie,"Garbage. The worst from the wonderful folks at Pixar. Sadly, in this one we have a know-it-all adolescent showing everyone about wisdom, and showing it with the attitude of a Barbie heroine. And the story! What story? For example, whatever happened to Merida's attitude (make that Attitude) about not being able to choose her own husband? Got me.A world away from the beauty and magic of Wall-E, La Luna, the Toy Stories. Here, we're told we should all bring up our babies to be Hillary Clintons. Fans of ""Brave"" should immediately turn to HBO's current skank show ""Girlzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.""Appropriately dedicated to Steve Jobs."
5,Came as expected,This is a nice video for just about any age. Our two year old granddaughter LOVES this and we adults like it too. It came as expected and in the right amount of time.
4,"Amazing Pixar Movie, and a great deal for this item.","Great deal here. For 20.00, I got a Blu-Ray, DVD and a bonus movie. Great movie too. I purchased it sight-unseen because I love Pixar's work but also it's just great reference (I'm a 3D artist too). The hair and water sims in this movie are mind-boggling. Great story too, of course. I totally recognized Kelly MacDonald's voice from Boardwalk Empire."
5,Funny,I laughed hysterically during this movie. There are so many funny parts. There is a good message behind it too. Classic Pixar kind of movie.
3,My boys left the room,"Not our favorite movie, at least not for young boys. Cute concept but it just didn't hold my 8 and 10 year old boys attention."
4,adorable movie,"As an adult I felt a little shy about watching the newest princess movie. But, I loved it. I have to say how great it was to see a main character focused on finding herself, not just falling in love. The character only wanted to grow and be herself. Really great movie for young girls."
5,Enjoyed it!,Technology is amazing! Movie was well done and very entertaining. ...and that comes from two senior citizen's. Enjoyed the music too.
2,Pixar caves to Disney,"While this was a stunningly beautiful movie visually it's apparent that Disney has officially taken over Pixar (was hoping Cars 2 was a fluke). Instead of the past Pixar quality story-line, this movie ended up being just another Disney ""princess"" movie that Pixar happened to animate. It seems Pixar has become nothing more than an outlet for Disney merchanidising potential. Bring back the heart of Up, charm of Wall-e, fun of Toy Story, and warmth of so many of the others! Here's hoping that Pixar gets back to what they used to do best...create a GREAT story we haven't seen over and over, then add their past wonderful animation!"
1,Pretty bad,"I thought this movie was pretty bad, and I signed on to Amazon to tell people this because the trailer you see for this movie is completely misleading. (Spoiler alert): It is not about a young girl who is courageous and fights for something realistic or anything like that, its simply about a girl who follows magic lights in the forest to a witches house and subsequently has her mother turned into a bear, and she spends the rest of the movie trying to turn her back into a human. I am a big fan of pixar films, but this one, this one is just stupid. And let me note, I expected a lot from this movie too, so that may play in to my 1 star review, the trailer looked really good, but its nothing like what the trailer portrays."
2,Was just okay,The reason I gave it 2 instead of 3 stars is because neither I or my 3 year old liked it very much. Not one that I will purchase. Watched Madagascar 3 a week earlier and it was by far the more entertaining movie.
2,Disappointed,"I was a bit disappointed in Pixar to have added crude parts to the film, things that they have not done before, and I was disappointed that they would fall into those, which many other films in different studios have done. I have loved Pixar for not adding those things in the past. This is not something I will let my small children watch. There were some scary parts that would be a little much for little viewers. I loved the story, loved the graphics. Amazed by the Animation- Pixar knows how to do it! But wish they would have kept it to the standard they have upheld in the past."
1,brave,"I hated this movie, was not entertaining at all. If Disney keeps making movies like this they will go out of business."
1,Very poor picture,I paid for HD. The movie was far from being HD. I should not have been charge for HD movie since the quality was so poor.
1,movie keep dropping,movie kept dropping and reloading which made it hard to watch i dont think it was my internet wont use amazon for movies if this keep up i have no problems with nexflix
3,heartwarming feminist fairy tale,lovely coming-of-age girl-as-warrior story. i especially enjoyed the animation of the bear fur and red hair. love to see more heroines.
5,Great movie for the whole family!,"My whole family watched this. Ages 5 to 75 and we all loved it!Good roll model for little girls. Be strong, be independant, be BRAVE!"
1,My first digital order and probably my last!,"It wasn't clear to me that for $14.99 i was purchasing a download for my Kindle. Why anyone with a 46"" lcd would want to watch a video on a kindle is beyond me.It cost me to learn, since downloads are not cancellable or refundable. Caveat Emptor!!!!"
1,"Love the Movie, Instant Streaming is OUT OF SYNCH","I love the movie Brave. So much that I decided to purchase the DVD in December. However, attempting to stream through Amazon Instant Video and a Roku player produced Audio and Video that were out of synch. Worse, I contacted Amazon the day we purchased the stream (in November) and it has taken the ""support team"" TWO MONTHS to attempt to ""fix"" the issue. I have received three form emails telling me that the technical support team is still working on this issue. I guarantee that a company like Amazon should not be struggling to fix a technical synch issue. So far, there has been no refund of my $5 to purchase the jobby stream or any attempt to give a coupon or discount for a future stream. I'm an Amazon Prime member, since the start of the program, and LOVE Amazon. BUT... I will not purchase an Instant Streaming Video ever again."
3,Looking for Single Disc Blu-Ray,"I enjoyed the movie in the theater enough to want to buy a copy of the film, but I can't seem to locate a single-disc Blu-Ray edition. There seem to be a lot of movies coming out that force you to buy a multi-disc set that includes both a Blu-Ray and a DVD edition but I'm only interested in the Blu-Ray and I don't need all the extras. Perhaps the publishers are trying to force people to go streaming only by coming out with very expensive multi-disc sets? I would think a lot more single-disc Blu-ray editions would be sold, enough to generate far more revenue per sale. For this one I think I'll just wait til a much cheaper rental version is available."
5,Brave was brilliant!,The characters were brilliant! I loved the Scottish accents and the story! The main character was a real fireball! I am hoping to score this DVD for Christmas!
3,"I'm a big Pixar fan, but this one was just OK.","I love everything that Pixar does and was really looking forward to this movie. I wasn't expecting it to be a ""brother bear"" movie. We enjoyed it and maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't seen Brother Bear, but I admit being disappointed in the story. Also, this is the first pixar movie that I won't be letting my small children watch until they are older... maybe 8 or 10."
5,Another great family movie,Disney does it again - the formula of loss and realization works between mother and daughter. The small gags along the way are truly what makes this stand apart from so many other animated features.
3,It was alright,"Expected a bit more from Pixar, this movie was alright to kill an evening, nothing to it. It's boring and predictable."
3,Not bad,Ok..but the story drags in the middle. Not one of Pixar's best movies. The storyline regarding the bear transformation was hokey.
3,Not one of Pixar's best,"I agree with many other reviews that noted this is the most ""Disneyfied"" of the Pixar movies, and much for the worse. The story is clichéd and lacks the genuinely touching moments that characterize the best Pixar movies (e.g. Wall*E's pining for Eva and the opening scenes of UP). There is a mildly feminist, anti-tradition message to the movie, but mostly it's the standard teenage rebellion story (with happy ending). Not recommended except the the visual effects."
3,Not Pixar's best,"The plot moved along much more quickly and with less interest than other Pixar movies. Enjoyed watching it, but it's not up to the story telling standard of the others. Also disliked the low class humor."
3,It was just OK,I don't have young children and my seventeen year old would not watch with me. It's great for young children.
3,Seemed to be a rather slow movie...,"Not very impressed with this movie. My son seemed to like it a bit, but even he lost interest about 2/3 of the way through."
3,ok....,It was Ok..one time watch...my 5 yr old got a bit scared during the movie. Overall Ok not so great..
5,great movie!!,"we loved this movie, my kids watched it about four times in the rental period. Thanks! I love Amazon Prime!"
3,uhhh,Its disappointing for a Disney movie none of my kids liked it. I miss Disney the way they used to make movies this one was not very good
2,Too much violence...,"We were searching for a relatively recent kids film to watch with our 10 year-old and she recommended Brave from the TV commercials she had seen last year. Well, what a disappointment! The message re mother-daughter relatins got completely obscured by the ludicrous fighting scenes (apparently they were supposed to be funny?). The worst was the scene where the bear/mother was tied and trapped in preparation for slaughter. A children's film? Did anyone really enjoy this film?"
2,Brave,"Brave:It was a terrible story. Not beleivable at all. the art work was good, but the music lost me. If I was a kid I would not have liked it."
2,Not what I thought,Delivery was great but the plot of this movie was not good. Got this for my son for christmas and wish I would have saved my money.
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I found it very difficult to understand what was being said as they made the ""Scottish"" accent a ""wee bit too much"" in my opinion. The story line left a bit to be desired as well."
3,Story line is weak,I liked the animation with the beautiful settings but the story line is a bit absurd and made me think it wasn't worth watching it in its entirety.
2,"Was hoping for arrows and swords, not witchcraft and whiny kids",Was unimpressed. Perhaps I saw too much potential in a movie with great accents and a girl with a bow. Was just another whiny rebelious kid discovers she has to be responsible sometimes.
2,pixar's second worst,"big disappointment, save your money and rent an older pixar movie instead. this was their worst movie since cars. ugh."
4,Great Family Movie,We liked this movie because it had the old fashioned aspects of good and evil what happens when you make bad choices and it is ok to be afraid. Family is there when you need them all you have to do is ask. There was not one minute of this little movie when I wanted to hide my face and cover the children's eyes.
5,Delightful Movie,This one was very very funny and so delightful for the whole family to enjoy with a huge bowl of popcorn on a wintery evening. We will enjoy this one as well for many years to come.
3,It has its moments,"...but is not up to Pixar's usual standard. Just not as engaging as others. Still, the acting is good and there are plenty of witty bits."
2,Disappointed by Pixar,"I was very disappointed with this movie, I felt it was a little to dark for a kid movie and wasn't good for young chldren."
2,Big let down.,Not the kind of story we were hoping for our family. It ended well but was not worth the time it took to get there.
3,"It was ok, not special","It a run of the mill disney film, doesn't have pixar's flair. The animation was great but the story wasn't of the level of films such as WallE etc."
4,Great but...,.. it was too short! Maybe it just felt like it. But it was really great. I really am glad I bought it :D
4,Parts are great.....,"The animation, especially facial expressions and dialect were great. Good story...little hard for me to understand some of the Scottish accents...Thought the rowdy, brainless Scottish clans were way overdone and distracting... often its the case with movies for young people...and their parents....there is something for everybody which is patronizing and dilutes the narrative flow."
3,Children's Movie,Like the movie but lost intrest in it half way though. but Amazon did a great job though instant video!
4,"Its Disney, Its Pixar, Need I say more?","Great animated film. Better on a second viewing. Pixar as always delivers the anticipated phenomenal animation. The score was complimentary to the action and the story while ""simple"" was sufficiently embellished to keep interest throughout. Suitable for kiddies and adults. A good addition to any family film library."
3,Tired Old story,"I really wanted to likethis movie, and visually, it was beautiful, but come on...This young adventurous girl wanting to break free of strict parents , see the world, learning the hard way, making amends in the end..is as old as the hills. Its the little mermaid, beautyand the beast, mulan, pocahontas, come on...are there no more creative, innovative minds in Hollywood????"
1,Utter waste,How this won an oscar over wreck it ralph is beyond me. Animation wise its alright but the story is stupid. Do not even rent it.
2,just didn't trip my trigger,"although i thought this was some of the best animation from pixar yet, somehow i just couldn't get into this movie. can't give any concrete reasons, but i just didn't care for the story."
2,Meh,"I'm sure this was much better in the theaters and in 3D. The animation was pretty nice and the visuals were probably pretty amazing in the theater. It's just that the story was kind of dumb. I like the idea of a girl who wants to change her destiny from one of being married off to one in which she has a say and think it's empowering for young girls. However, her mom gets turned into a bear? We were sitting there going, who came up with this idea?"
4,good!,WHile this isnt our favorite Pixar film it was up there for sure. The color and graphics are beautiful and the story was cute. They couldve developed it a little better and made a richer plot but over all i left being glad i saw the movie. Id watch it again.
3,Average Pixar movie at best.,"All in all, I wasn't really enthralled with this movie one way or the other: hence the down the middle rating. The animation was good, but to some degree, these movies are starting to get a little out there for kids.The witch for example, is not the ""friendliest"" character in the movie. While Pixar tries to make a witch not scary and frightening, I believe she still comes across as such. The bears attacking each other and the cursed bear can provide a few scary moments.By the end of the movie, I was tired of the overdone accents of the characters. It was cute at first, but 93 minutes of hard to understand scottish accents was a little too much for me.Glad we rented it and didn't buy it."
2,Great for femenist moms but.........,"This is a movie about bashing little boys. Some producers have decided to deviate from the traditional girl finds prince scenario. That scenario, is really what makes a great film. What they did in Brave, is attack and undermine little boys. If you are an adult and can see through the political correctness amuck then watch it. Please do not let impressionable children see it. It will give the message that boys are inferior goofs.There is nothing wrong with a young girl dreaming of finding her perfect soul mate (prince) in life.Unfortunately, a few bitter and angry woman want to take this away.I saw the film at a friens home. I would personally not contribute finacially to this cause. Send a message by not buying films like this"
1,"Good movie, defective dvd.",My kids and I immensely enjoyed the movie. It is unfortunate that the regular blu-ray dvd does not play past the second scene. It is rather irritating. We ended up watching it without blu-ray all together. I just hope that the 3d one will at least work...
5,A New Classic,"Brave portrays the powerful story about the difficulties a young woman named Merida has between following tradition and family expectations versus following her heart. Merida is strongwilled like her mother and they come to a confrontation regarding her betrothal. Carving a path that both may agree to is the heart of Brave. Merida learns that actions have consequences and may require equally brave actions to mend the strong bond of family.This movie contains stunning cinematography, perfect editing, quality acting, powerful music and a compelling story filled with adventure, surprise, mystique and laugh out loud humor however children less than 4 may find that the roaring bear is scary.I would be very proud to be Scottish today! We absolutely loved this movie and highly recommend it!!"
1,Very Unhappy,Bought this for a Christmas Gift for my daughter. We watched it once and then decided to watch it again tonight but the movie will no longer play. We tried everything and we also played other movies to rule out the DVD player. Its indeed the DVD and its a shame that after owning it for a short while it's garbage. I will NEVER buy from Amazon again!!
4,Great movie spoiled by Disney's copy protection or something,"We were only able to watch this movie on Blu-ray by messing with the fast-forward, fast-reverse and play buttons. Without that fiddling it would display the scene icon continuously, run in fast-forward, or freeze, and, once, the audio was delayed by a couple of seconds after a deliberate pause.Buy it for the movie, which is well done, but be prepared to return it."
3,Cute,"My family came in over Thanksgiving and we rented this as something safe for everyone to watch. And personally, I love heroine movies. I loved The Princess and the Frog. This movie, really, was kind of disappointing. It was a bit slow and frankly uninteresting; 3/4 of the fam lost interest halfway through."
2,Great movie - but the picture quality is poor,"My daughter and I saw this movie in the theater and we loved it. However, the picture quality of the purchased DVD is not that good. It is very red and dark. We have so many other movies on DVD that are fine. Perhaps our DVD player needs to go, but I was surprised at the picture quality for this movie. Anyway, the movie itself is very heartwarming."
3,Good Graphics good accents,"A little too much magic for our taste. Witches and wisps and magic spells not what we really like, it is too bad so many kids shows contain these elements."
4,"A good movie but no ""UP""","This is a good movie and very enjoyable but it doesn't come up the to standards of ""UP"" and other pixar movies. Still, very much worth watching and owning."
3,"Beautiful movie, but not great for Pixar","Beautiful movie, great voice acting, but I did not think the plot or characters were as endearing as the other Pixar films. If Disney had made this, I would have thought, fair enough (and I am a huge Disney fan), but coming from Pixar, I was disappointed. On the reverse, Disney's Wreck It Ralph was wonderful and seemed more like a Pixar movie."
3,okay but not great,Fine movie but compare to other pixar movies it is only okay. Too girlish I would say. Just like any other pixar movies the computer drawings are amazing
3,Okay movie,I was hoping for so much more from this. So much potential wasted with only average story telling. Animation was well done the story left something to be desired.
5,Inspirational,Loved the story....characters was cool and very colorful. The movie is very inspirational and is something kids could learn from.
3,A flick for the ladies...,"There you go, they finally made a film for the girls, and like most girl flicks,the men are either comic relief or are portrayed as kind of dummies. So yes theanimation is gorgeous and the story not too bad, but when they introduced a songin the early beginning , i cringed and made me ready for the rest."
4,Scary for the little ones,"Cute, but scary. I wish they wouldn't go so dark, but it is cute and well done. It's easy to watch or come in at any section of the movie and watch"
5,What Absolute FUN!!!,"Arrived Tuesday, 11/13/12, via pre-ordered - Wonderful, sealed, new, all versions included - So glad to have it - Thank You! THIS IS A GREAT, Great Movie! Story - What incredible Animation Detail - Fascinating! A Must Have!"
5,Great movie,"Brave is a wonderful movie. It's a rare princess movie that is about her relationship with her mother, not about getting saved or finding a man. And, being Pixar, you know it's stunning and fun to watch."
2,Weak story line,"Brave takes CG animation to a new level and is a visual feast, however, the story line is weak and the movie loses steam and focus just when it should crescendo. The title is a misnomer. The heroine isn't as brave as she is a self-centered narcissist, but that will appeal to the teenage and 20 something set for whom this mindset is normative. But perhaps mother-daughter conflicts are just not as appealing to me as other plot devices. I was expecting something along the lines of ""How to Train Your Dragon"", but it falls way short."
2,Technology duth not make a geat movie alone,Our 3 year only (in to Disney Princess industry in a big way) lost interest in this story after 10 minutes. To be honest so did I. The plot was a little hard to grasp for tots and unfortunately the state of the art graphics and animation did not make up for the less than perfect script and story. Not worth the price of the rental for us.
2,"Why Pixar, Why?!!","One extra star for Best Rendering of Hair in a Computer Animated Feature. As for the rest of my review... well, some folks may somewhat enjoy this thing, but my wife and I just stared at each other when it was over and said in unison, ""That was kinda sucky."""
2,Glad we got a good deal on price,"Because we didn't like it. It's just okay. Honestly, if I had seen it before purchasing it would not have even gotten it at all. Not even at the price we got it for. I will probably never watch it again. My kids didn't even seem interested, either. We'll see if they want to watch it in the future. My recommendation is try before you buy."
5,Great Movie,"We rented this before I bought it, my Husband and I as well as all 4 of our kids just loved this movie!!"
5,Disney's Brave a Hit!!!,"The newest Disney release is a great family film... Full of good morals and good laughs, the kids couldn't wait to watch it again! A great movie for young and old!!"
4,Cute movie,This was cute. Some deeper parts for adults. Not sure I'd let really young kids see it. (don't remember what it is rated)
4,Good movie,"We used this for the Christmas movie at school, the kids loved it. It's fun to listen to them laugh and giggle."
4,GOOD PRICE,"GOOD PRICE FOR A POPULAR MOVIE. ALTHOUGH I DO WISH THAT DISNEY WOULD MAKE A BUNDLE WITH JUST A REGULAR DVD AND BLURAY IN IT. ITS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE ALL 5 DVDS, BUT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET A BLURAY ONE."
5,Brave is great,Great story and great animation. This is a feel good movie that anyone can enjoy. A great moral story for all.
5,Amazon instant video rental,Watched it several times. It is exciting and very different than other kids moves. It was not as predictible as the most comon kids movies.
4,Cute,It was a nice kid movie that adults can enjoy too. A little different to your typical princess tale. Especially good movie for young girls.
3,Brave,I thought this movie was Good. Not as good as some of the other PIXAR movies but still pretty good story and graphics are of course beautiful..
4,Cute - but not for very young children,"Some adult humor, some adolescent bathroom humor, naked animated backsides. Enjoyed the story line and the music. Like Shrek, this is appropriate for adults and older children."
4,Would have given a 5 if not for the violence.,I would have given it a 5 if not for the violence with the bear and swords with the vikings. It scared the heck out of my 3 year old grandson. He loved the happy affectionate part with the little girl and her mother and her brothers.
5,Best Princess Movie EVER!,"This movie is AWESOME! Not only will children love it - adults will too! My 4 sons AND my 2 daughters LOVE it. The twins are hilariously mischievous for my boys and the fact that this girl is a princess AND independent makes me rough and tough daughters ecstatic! She's a get in there and kill a deer kind of girl and movie is her favorite right now. A girl who isn't just a sit and act pretty, but a get in there and make something happen kind of gal."
4,Great movie for girls over 7,I loved this movie! Thank you Disney for finally making a movie about smart strong women who don't need a knight in shinning armor. Even my husband stayed awake and watched the whole movie! And that says something.The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it is still scary for younger girls. My 5 year old was truly terrified. The bears are frightening and confusing.So if your daughter is over 7-ish and not easily scared please watch this movie!
4,"Funny, different, and a little scary","My whole family enjoyed the movie. Lots of good laughs, very visually appealing. Didn't have the emotional depth it could have. The ""dark bear"" was very scary, partly BECAUSE of the visual intensity. My eight-year-old girls were a little overwhelmed by that part."
5,Love it,Heartwarming movie for the whole family! Some parts may be scary for small children but all in all..Great job Disney!!
3,"Great visuals, but far from great as a whole...","I was disappointed with the overall execution of the story in Brave. To me, this film is disjointed in its attempt to make some sort of unified point, under utilizing characters and"
2,I guess Disney needed another product line so out comes this story.,Same old same old story. Lacking all novelty. Lame parents. Poor misunderstood princess who is just so special....but sadly misunderstood. Lots of predictable stuff happens and then the story ends. Of course the princess finds her true voice and the parents realize how wrong they were.
1,Extremely Poor TV Reception,"Film kept freezing up during the entire movie, could not exit amazon to get to any other movie, locked up many times , very poor reception"
2,Let down,Not a great story and not for kids. I usually love these movies but they missed the mark on this one. I loved the idea but was let down
3,Cute and Sweet,"Brave was cute and sweet, but I was expecting Merida to be a little more bad ass. A bit too whiny and not enough take charge."
2,"Nice move, if I could have finished it","It crapped out halfway through watching it and I was never able to get it to play again on my Kindle Fire, my desktop, or my Roku. So, boo on you, Brave!"
2,Scary,My children are 3 and 5 years old. This movie scared them to death. There is allot of magic in the movie as well as scary bears. I would NOT recommend this movie to a friend.
5,Brave,This is an entertaining movie for young and old. The story was cute and the three little bears were adorable.
5,Great movie for all ages!,"We loved this in the movies, so I wanted it for my grandson, since we saw it without him! He enjoyed it as well! Especially great for young girls!"
3,Not their best,"It was okay, I'm sure little ones will love it. But Disney Pixar has had better, wasn't for me though."
3,Not worth the wait.,"I love animation and will go to great efforts to see an animated film. With that said, I was required to wait until this came out on DVR, I should of just rented it and not wasted my money on buying it. Hacked together story line where it was very clear the director forgot what needed to be done and when it needed to be done."
3,Returned,"Didn't watch this. I wanted the blu-ray and accidentally ordered this. I saw the movie in theater, beautiful imagery. Plot needed a bit of tweaking."
2,Thank god I watched this before letting my 2 year old watch it.,This is so not a kids movie!!! I am so glad I was impatient and watched this before letting her watch it. She had seen the commercials for this on tv and was asking for it more than once. I bought it for her but thankfully watched it before she did (after he went to bed). Take my advice watch this before letting your kids watch it. Personally I think it is a bit scary for kids!
2,Silly Story,"Beautiful to look at. Boring, ridiculous story. Pixar movies have been great so far. This is the worst I've seen - but I never saw Cars-3."
2,Questionable theme not evident in marketing,A princess who gets upset with her mother curses her...this is more of a morality tail than an uplifting adventure.It just wasn't what we expected.
3,Mother/ daughter plot,"No prince Charming, no romance, just a headstrong daughter who causes a problem and then has to fix it. The animation was wonderful tho."
3,great animation as usual for Pixar,The movie started off with much hope but then the 2nd half got very plotty and draggy. In the end it was an okay movie with great animation.
4,"Good movie, but I was expecting more ""adventure""","From the previews, I was honestly expecting some sort of sojourn/journey for Merida as she sought to prove herself to her parents to avoid being married off. She was an awesome character, and Kelly MacDonald was a perfect choice (even if I kept picturing her role in Boardwalk Empire)...the rest of the cast was great.I had a lot of fun watching this with my toddler (when she actually paid attention). It's not violent; I was surprised they were able to make this type of movie without any gratuitious violent, but it had much less fighting than a movie such as Hercules.Overall a pleasant watch and probably a good addition to the collection, but the thirtysomething man in me was just hoping for a little more adventure."
4,Funny and light family film,First of all this is definitely a kids flick but on that adults can enjoy. Ancient Scottish culture was full of paganism and this film feeds on the superstitions of those people. Good animatio and good voice acting come together nicely. Probably my works better for a female audience or at least to have one to help you appreciate the movie more.
3,Not my favorite Disney movie...,"I think I was expecting a movie more like the other Princess movies and was a bit disappointed. While I don't think the characters always need to have a ""happily ever after"" with a ""prince"" at the end of the movie, I felt like she had a super boring life before the story and she was just destined for a whole lot of more boring at the end. It was OKAY, but I really loved Princess and the Frog, Beauty and the Beast, etc. and I felt like this one just wasn't on par with those."
3,Why can't kids movies back off on the violence?,Great animation makes older stuff look bad. But this scares my 4 year old girl. In the post Newtown age we need movies where people are not killing each other. By the way Cars 2 is crazy violent.
4,great quality; cute story,"cute story; great cinematics; I enjoyed it, as did my son. I would give 4.5 stars if I could, but not quite 5"
5,Fantastic movie!,"This is a must see! Great message delivered in a wonderful story that everyone will like. No need for a Prince Charming rescue, the heroin of this story gets the job done!"
3,Pixar can do better,Its an okay movie but has to much Disney influence in the production. The story is just so-so and the character development wasn't great. If it was made just by Disney it would have been fine. But this being a Pixar production they really drop the ball.
5,Extraordinary,Excellent story with great Pixar animation. I read a reviewer said it does not fit the Pixar story standards. Not true. Excellant original story that Pixar is famous for. Great addition to the Pixar family.
2,Bears?!?!? Stinking previews!,"For me this movie was a prime example of misleading previews!! I went into this movie thinking I was going to see the story of a princess who fights to keep her freedom...and to be honest I kind of got that for the first 20 minutes of the movie. She quickly looses the battle has a tantrum and runs away, gets a potion from a witch and turns her mom and 3 siblings into bears. Then realizes that maybe she shouldn't have done that and tries to get an antidote before her father kills said bears. I found the story to be very boring and in general badly written. I didn't care about any of the characters, which surprises me so much as this came from Pixar and they ALWAYS get me to care about the characters. The animation was stunning that's why it gets 2 stars."
4,"Great movie, but 3-D effects are not worth it.. Save your money and buy the blu-ray","There are over 800 reviews of this movie as I write this, so obviously this has been reviewed many times before.Because it already has so many reviews, this is not a review of the movie itself, but specifically of the 3-D portion. Some 3-D movies are really incredible, with objects ""flying"" out at you and things ""floating"" in your living room. These 3-D movies, in my opinion, are absolutely worth the extra money. Others, however, simply give the movie another layer of depth, but are not really that different from the blu-ray version. This is the case for Brave. Great movie, but I was very disappointed with the 3-D effects. Save yourself the extra money and buy the blu-ray version instead. If you want a great Disney movie with fantastic 3-D effects, buy Tangled instead. The 3-D effects are unbelievable!(I gave it 4 stars because it is a very good movie, but minus one because of the 3-D effects.)"
4,Pretty Good,"Pretty good, kept the boys (3 + 5) interest for the whole movie. They like some of the other animated movies like How to Train Your Dragon and Tangled better."
4,Different and Visually appealing,"* Lot of great scenes in the animation* Characters are a treat, very creative, will have kids think and imagine lot of things* Takes kids to a different world, though I disagree with an earlier comment regarding the independent part. Kids have to understand parents do things for a certain reason, if all kids become independent at young age, then why parents or teachers? May give a wrong message to the already confused kids of our generation.* Songs are nice, soundtracks very good"
5,kids loved it!,My 6 year old daughter said she'd give this one million stars! Mom and Dad enjoyed the positive female role modeling.
5,Awesome,"Seriously, this is one of my favorite movies to come out recently. I had to go see it twice in theaters, though I'm not one to normally go to the same movie twice. A wonderful twist on a Disney Princess who doesn't WANT to get married."
4,Too cute! <3,"I loved it. It was a cute, original storyline. The characters were well-drawn, high quality animation, a blend of folklore and modern values. The princess was a brat, her brothers darling. I don't want to say too much and give the story away, but the ending had me in sentimental tears (just like most Pixar movies do.) This is child-friendly, yet not childish. The movie got better and better as it evolved. I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD and so glad I finally got to see it!"
4,Love it!,"It may not measure up to other Pixar movies , but it's still an amazing movie. I can see why some people may not like it because it's similar to another Disney movie (Brother Bear). However, I think the movie was cute and the animation was stunning."
4,I liked it,You really can't go wrong with a pixar movie. I was very entertained and it kept my attention. Felt like a typical storybook tale. The animation was spectacular. The detail they put in the main characters hair was phenomenal. I definitely give this movie a thumbs up :-)
2,Bravery,"This offering is intended for an audience to run through in a light hearted manner, but it bored me silly. I was lost in the silly girl in quest of changing her mother's mind to the wild extreme of making a deal with a witch and turning her mother into a bear, sorry it just did not resonate for me."
2,Not what I expected,This movie was not nearly as good as the hype. I felt like it was very short and cheesy and lacked the adult disney humor in their older movies -- that let adults enjoy them as much as the kids do!
2,A rare Pixar misstep. And what a shame!,"What a missed opportunity - Pixar could have done so much better. It's like they went for the lowest common denominator. Think of great movies like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and ""The Incredibles"" --- innovative films that don't rely on rehashed ideas from other cliche-ridden movies. Anything old, these movies reinvent and make new again. That is what Brave should have been. Instead we have a movie that should have been called ""Brother Bear 3.""Yes, my kid enjoyed the movie and that is what counts. But the truly great Pixar films have not been directed simply at kids; they are family films that can be enjoyable for anyone at any age. I can watch ""Finding Nemo"" annually and enjoy it each time. On the other hand, ""Brave"" is a movie I could have done without and will certainly never watch again. This one just didn't have the Pixar magic we have all come to expect."
2,Not that interesting,The movie is boring. There is nothing new or catching. A lot of the standard fairy tale pieces mixed together. A waste of time.
2,A bore with small rip offs of disneys robin hood,"Rip off of a few moments from Disney's Robin Hood. BORING, no comedy - poorly executed. Possibly the worst Pixar movie ever made."
3,A little scary,"I was surprised at how scary this movie could be for little kids. Even my cat got scared at all the growling and barking in the final fight scene. Overall it held my interest and had a couple funny parts, but I'm glad I didn't pay too much to watch it."
5,No complaints here,Great movie for kids. Anyone who likes a good Disney flick would enjoy it. Not a musical like most Disney princess movies.
4,Good movie,"My wife and daughter really wanted to see this. Friday (our movie night) arrived, and Amazon has the movie a fair price. My son and I joined the wife and daughter, and we made a night of it.Plot and flow of story, fairly typical, but it has a different feel to it. I liked it, my wife liked it, my son and daughter loved it.What else can you ask for."
4,Fun but beware,My grandsons like this movie... they are ages 3 and 5. But there are a few parts that scared them...
3,Not the best Pixar movie...,"As a disclaimer, I'm an older guy, but I do love Pixar films. I feel they have a great mix of a good story, great voice-acting, and animation that is always pushing the industry forward.All-in-all, the film isn't bad. The acting and animation are what you'd expect from a Pixar film (and that's good). I just don't know that this storyline is as good as it could be. Don't get me wrong, a ""good"" Pixar film is still far-better than a lot of the other animated films out there."
3,Good!,Great price for this collection. Love listening to the lilt in the voices. Storyline good. Merida caused the problem but at least she fixed it. Merida wasn't the most respectful child but she did come full circle and learn.
5,What's Not To Love,"Even if you have seen this movie, you really need to see it on BluRay! Gave it to my niece for Christmas and she has watched it at least 5 times since then."
4,Great Family Movie!,"Great movie, a mother daughter must see! Really great to see the princess doesn't need a prince to come to their rescue."
4,Great Movie,"It has some awkward moments, but overall is a funny and heart warming story. This is a little bit of a spoiler, but I am really glad there is finally a Disney movie where the female character doesn't end up being saved by or being with Prince Charming in the end."
4,Brave,Brave is funny and poignant. We enjoyed it a lot. Would recommend it. It is a woderful story for mothers and daughters.
4,Very good movie,"Was great to sit down as a family and watch this. The entire family, including 10yo daughter and 7yo son, enjoyed it which is a plus."
5,Cute Movie!,"pros: great family moviecons: a few scary parts for the little onesI don't need the 3D version, but I wanted the digital copy"
3,"Well done, maybe better for kids","I'm an adult and got talked into watching this movie. The animations are beautiful and it is a well done movie, but I found the story to have a somewhat forced moral at the end, definitely a kids focused movie but entertaining enough for anyone to sit through."
4,A sweet and fun movie,"The general negative reviews here (other than ""I bought the wrong version"") seem to be that this movie could have been more. It could have been a better and deeper story.You know, Pixar isn't trying to go for a super serious story; they were going for a fun Scottish-themed adventure about a strong princess, her relationship with her mother, the shift in her worldview from her parents, and the dangers of bringing a witch into the fray.It had a very fun story, an interesting back story, fun characters, and beautiful effects.It isn't my favorite Pixar film but it's a wonder to look at, a fun story for a pre-teen to teenager, and a warm film with very light scary scenes."
5,Great movie,"Great movie for kids and adults, just makes you feel good - quality good although on my HD tv I found it to be a bit dark in places - not sure yet whether to lighten my screen settings"
4,Brave DVD,I purchased this DVD for my Granddaught for Christmas . As I have never seen it myself I can't be sure but I recieved it in a timely manner and the DVD was in very good condition.
4,Way cute movie,Movie was great. I don't think it was Pixar's greatest work but it was very cute for a Disney movie.
4,Fun For Adults,"My husband and I rented Brave via Amazon instant video (which was awesome!) and we really enjoyed the movie but thought it was much too scary for our 5 and 3 year old boys. There was a lot of scary and intense bear parts, and people hunting bears. There was humor spread throughout, my husband and I laughed out loud quite a few times, but overall not very kid friendly. We will be waiting quite a while before watching it with our boys."
5,Great story,"Even though some parts of this movie might be a little iffy for some children, I like how the story says believe in yourself and stand up for what you believe in."
3,Could have been Better.,"Great Anime, but the story was weak. Seems like the same old same old story, try to think up something new (original). Or due what everyone else is doing, Steal a story that has allredy worked from England or Europe."
2,That was it?,"As normal for a Pixar animation the graphics were great. However, the storyline was just not that exciting. Knowing it was nominated for awards I guess I just expected a lot more."
3,Kids love it but I didnt care for the disrespect,"I purchased this for my granddaughter and it is a good movie but I did not like the disrespect they allowed the daughter to have her Mother, now of course everything works out fine at the end but I guess I should say is a better movie for a older child one that has learned not to talk sassy to their parents!"
4,Loved the Graphics,The Movie was very visually stunning. I liked the characters and was captivated the whole time. I recommend this title for people of all ages.
5,Great movie,"This was my first full-length video purchase on Amazon Instant Video. The video runs smoothly with a great picture. As for the movie, it is very entertaining and my daughter loves it."
1,Brave,Started to watch it but it is full of witchcraft and sorcery among other things so we opted not to watch this movie.
1,did not like it!,"This movie was a bad one, too much dark magic and witchcraft and the fact that is directed towards the mom I did not like.It makes me wonder why are this movies such a negative ..It worries me as a caring parent like me who wants to protect the mind of her children the bad influence that this movies might have in a child's mind."
2,MENS' NAKED BUTTS????,Really Disney/Pixar????? You think our children need to see the naked butts of animated grown men??? Please don't do that anymore.
1,All discs fine except the 3D disc - visible distortion on the disc and will not play without tearing and locking up the Player,Loved the movie and the animation is fantastic - my issues have been with the 3D disc. I have returned and received four replacements all with the same results. I am using this on my internal Lite-On BD Drive with Cyberlink PowerDVD 12 Ultra with latest firmware/software updates and I can play all of my BluRay Movies in 3D with my Asus/NVidia monitor and 3D glasses except this one's 3D disc which in all four attempts I have received from Amazon the 3D disc itself has visible distortion whereas the 2D version in the same packages plays fine and does not have any visible distortion. The 3D discs will all play part way through but will then seize with tearing in the video and will lock up the Cyberlink Software.
1,Bad,"This movie was interesting graphically, but the plot, the characters, and the annoyingly adolescent mayhem of the star were unappealing. The worst Pixar movie we've seen."
5,"WOW, I mean WOW","My friend and I laughed out loud. It's been a long time since that happened. We were all teary eyed at the end. The audience was FULL of children, and except for one very young child that got scared at one point and cried they were all spellbound the entire time. More than 100 kids, sitting quietly in silence. With only one misfire (in my opinion) Pixar understands it's the STORY, not not technology, that makes for an amazing movie."
2,"Rerun, different characters and setting.","The animation and music in this movie are great, other than that, typical Disney princess formula. Princess is unhappy with her lot in life that is better than 98% of the peasants that are around her castle. An adult is making her unhappy, often a parent or step parent. Eventually princess shows some remorse and understanding, but gets her way after causing a lot of chaos. Yawn.... Oh yes, there is as always some kind of villain creeping around, in this case a bear.Also there is some nudity and a young boy that looks like a small bear diving down the front of a woman's dress - great kid fare, right?The best part of this movie at least for me was the witch - oh and the Pixar short ""La Luna"" that was before it - now that was a show of real creativity and imagination!"
5,Best Animated Film This Year,"I went into this movie not knowing at all what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised with a visual extravaganza of brilliant color and painstakingly detailed beauty. This movie makes the natural environment come alive on screen. The animation is second to none. The story itself is wonderful, about a daughters quest for independence and the struggle in a mother/daughter relationship that is timeless. My daughter is 10 and absolutely loved the film. As a Dad, I loved seeing her breath in and be captured by the story. The heroine is young and strong and sends a good message for women today. There is plenty of humor to amuse both the young and old. I also do not think it is any more frightening than the Disney classics of old like Snow White or Cinderella that had their share of villainous scenes.I can't wait for this film to come out on Blue-Ray so I can enjoy it again in my own home."
5,Cute movie,This is a very cute movie while at the same time a teaching movie. My son really enjoys watching it!
5,Brave,"Fun movie -- may be frightening for some kids who haven't yet distinguished between story and fact, but that's Disney for you."
4,"Great movie, but disappointed with the bonus features","While Brave was a terrific movie, the bonus features were lacking. I enjoyed the 'extended' scenes, which were limited. I was EXCITED to see there was an alternate opening sequence, and then that excitement disappeared once I started watching it. It was partially complete, so in my opinion it shouldn't have been added at all. If you're going to put a bonus feature like that on there, then at least finish the job!Other than that, great Blu-Ray."
5,Great Movie!,"Brave was an awesome movie with some really cool graphics. The Blu-Ray is awesome, and it's an extremely fun movie."
3,I hoped for more,"Pixar man, they sort of missed the magic mark with this one. It reminded me too much of a difficult teenager learning what's important in life...with emphasis on ""difficult teenager""...who wants to watch that!"
3,ok,"good movie, not our fav. Story is ok, but showing a child disobeying parents is not always a great way to teach our kids the meaning of honoring your parents wishes."
3,Meh.,"I've seen better Disney movies. This one was only somewhat amusing.Probably the most interesting bit of the movie, at least to me, was the animation of her hair and such. It looked wet when they got wet, etc.Overall, the movie wasn't that amazing, but I'm not a young child, and I don't have children."
3,Slow starter!,"The beginning did not pull me in at all. I thought the princess was a little too obnoxious but it did get better at the end. She later learned her lesson and started to respect, appreciate, and love her mother. There are some slapstick comedy moments that were enjoyable."
2,worst pixar movie to date,"Brave is the worst Pixar movie to date. Not that it is a bad movie. Far from it. But it reeks like old time Disney fairy tales and the pace is much too slow. For the first time, I am left wondering if the amazing creativity at Pixar will ever come back."
2,Average,I did not like it. Lacked excitement. Plot didnt not have a distinct character. The princess character did not impress me either :)
3,"Bear is cute, girl is a brat","The setup for this movie is misleading. You may go into it expecting a Joan of Arc storyline, but you'd be wrong. It's more of a modern tale. That being said, the bears are the best characters by far."
2,Disappointed,Gotta love the Pixar movies. . . . except this one. Sure hope this is a set back and not where Pixar is headed. Sorely disappointed.
2,Annoying,"I usually love the types of movies, but I found this one boring and the characters annoying. I was very disappointed."
2,Meh,Not Pixar's best work. Story takes a very bizarre turn and frankly I just didn't enjoy it very much. Not the worst movie ever but I'll never watch it again.
4,Very Good!!,"Good movie, great theme, mothers and daughters will love it!! The animation is fantastic - love the fact that she's bold and adventurous - a good role model for other girls."
3,Not what I expected,"It's hard to write a movie review without spoiling the plot, but basically this movie didn't live up to my expectations. I had no idea from the previews that this movie centered around her relationship with her mother. I don't see how young kids could relate."
5,Cute movie,"My daugter was very excited to see this in theaters and finally to get it for Christmas, thanks very much"
2,Was expecting more..,"Wanted to watch Monsters Inc on amazon instant play but it was temporarily unavailable, probably due to the fact that its currently in theaters. So my boyfriend and I settled on this since the comedian Craig Ferguson was one of the voice actors in it, so we expected it to be funny. If you're a 20 year old couple, I don't recommend it. There were some funny moments but it was very slow moving and not what we were looking for. If you want a Disney Pixar movie that's also entertaining, watch Ratatouille!"
2,The trailer is misleading,What you seen in the trailer is basically the first several minutes of the movie. I thought the movie would be about a strong independent woman like the movie Tangled but it's not. The final battle is not even between the main character and the bad guy. Also the movie was very scary for my 5 year old
5,Great movie,"Really enjoyed this film. Great story line, characters & graphics. The wold family enjoyed it very much. It was funny, lots of laughter."
4,Great movie!!!!,My daughter loves this movie & watches it daily! I got it at a great price and plan to watch it myself. Good job Amazon!!!
3,Not that special.,"Standard formula animated movie. Although there really wasn't anything wrong with it , there also wasn't anything right with it either."
3,Brave Is No Rave,The movie is simply just okay. The problem is it has no real moving story. She does not want the princess duties blah blah but learns to accept her responsibility. Her Mom and brothers become bears but turn back into humas at end of film. Predictable.
3,Didn't enjoy,Not nearly up to the standard of other recent animated features. Very thin story line and reliance on repetitive gags.
2,Arrived without the shaft nut in the packaging.,"Haven't installed them yet, but feeling paranoid I opened the packaging up tonight to verify that ALL the parts were in the boxes. Lo and behold, one of the packages is missing the shaft nut for the shock top. Awesome. Thanks, Monroe! ;)"
4,Ella quiera swing!!!,"This is a smokin CD! At times you may feel as thought everyone would much rather be singing reggeton (Pobre Diabla), but quickly reverts back to pure swinging salsa. My favorite on this CD is the duet will Tito Rojas the song ""Ella y Yo""."
1,Not The Complete Poem,I was quite annoyed to buy this version of Maud and find that it wasn't complete. I actually was only able to find a complete version for free on the internet.
5,Very helpful and so pleased I bought this book!,"I have been putting off as I had great difficulty explaining to my six year old that I have multiple sclerosis and why my legs are ""wobbly"", that I cannnot run and do things like other mothers' can and that from time to time I would have to spend days and nights in hospital. I was very conscious that I did not wish my child to be unduly worried with my condition. This book explained perfectly how to explain your illness to your child in ways that they will understand. Now I have explained my condition to my child and how it affects me and I am confident that my explanation was understood in a positive way - thank you!!"
1,Conta-indicated for its purpose,In short I have two main criticisms of this book: 1) The author is quite impressed with herself and I found the examples were more about her than the potential positive impact on the chilren and often there appeared to be some real professional boundaries breached. 2) The focus of the book was on younger children and I was looking for insight related to my 11 and 15 year old nephews.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The movie adaptation part is completely missable, but great sideys on the Pun in the comic with Spider-Man that is included, and the 'Welcome Back Frank' part at the end is good. Other than that part, you could get any single other Punisher trade or collection or something of that ilk and it is likely to be better."
2,Disappointing,"Having just seen the movie, my fears were mostly not met from reading this adaptation before the film came out. It mirrors the events in the film, but the dialogue is atrocious, something that is quite a surprise from scribe Peter Milligan (X-Statix). The epic fight between the Punisher and the Russian, one of the best filmed fights in recent memory, is reduced to two pages here. The whole thing seems rushed, with the art being the only saving grace. It may be worth a look for Punisher enthusiasts, but it isn't worth laying down any hard earned cash for. Thankfully, the movie is much better."
4,"Nice book, probably best for beginners","Joanna Gollberg does nice books. I've got some experience with metalsmithing and this book didn't have a whole lot of new information for me, but she explains techniques very well. The projects are interesting and her gallery shots (pictures of work from other artists) are just incredible."
5,Had to Have it!!,I got this book out at the library and fell in love with it sooooo much i had to go out and buy it. It's great!! It has visual pictures to get you through each step and it has many examples of other jewelers works. It even had works of my teacher in it. Great book and great guide. I recommend it to anyone!!
5,The Art & Craft of Making Jewelry,This is an excellent book with wonderful projects and great instructions and detail! This one is worth buying!
5,The Best Pop Group,"La producción (Best Of: Live at the Nec [IMPORT]- Go West), es una de las mejores producciones del grupo Ingles.Lo unico que he podido opinar es sobre la producción, es la mezcla de los temas (que fueron grabado live) por ejemplo los metales (Trompetas y Trombon y Sax) se escuchan un un poco bajo de volumen, pero la calidad de la interpretación de los temas y la acoplación de los espcialemente del bajista son exelentes.Tambien hago referencia de Peter Cox, para mi es uno de los mejores cantates de Pop del mundo ya que que su estilo es muy original, y tiene algunos estilos en sus interpretaciones de c/u de los temas. De Richard Drummie que te puedo decir es un execelente Musico y cantante.Acerca de los dos temas nuevo grabado en el estudio, son excelentes, la armonia y el arreglo de los dos temas.Le recomiendo que compren esta producccion esta Super Cool !!!!!!!!!No se arrepentiran."
4,Good for the price,"This is a good option if you'd like to learn just a little of a lot of different languages. It obviously doesn't have the depth of a more extensive single-language program. The interface is easy to learn and uniform across the various languages. I found the learning approach to be good, but not great. Note that the program has to run from disk. If you have a laptop with no built-in optical drive, you will have to create a disk image and run it on a virtual drive (not as technical as it might sound, google it)."
5,languages,"My grandson was so excited to receive this from me, He has a desire to learn other languages and he is impressed with this product. Thanks for the fast delivery to him."
1,bwahhhhhhaaaaa!,Hotty Toddy!We won ten games!We are pathetic!Eli is gone and so are our championship hopes!Don't buy this crud unless you're a goofball.
1,Absolutely hilarious,"The other reviewers are right. Nothing's more delusional than calling a second-place finish a ""magical"" season. Only the weebles would be so starved for winners that they would make a big deal of a West co-championship. Come on!! Even Gerry Dinardo accomplished that twice."
1,Too-too,"The writer of this book leads readers into, well, a mess. The information and ideas are hard to find, let alone grasp. The writing style wanders around the point versus nailing it. A frustrating book. On the same topic, SACRED SPACE by Denise Linn is a much better book because it gets to the POINT much more quickly and is easier to understand."
1,Didn't like it at all!,"What a bizarre book. It wasn't what I expected at all and had pagan undertones to it. Not sure if that was the intent but it's not what most Christians understand as spiritual. Even says the body is not a temple, the house is. Talks about rituals to free yourself from the past and having friends over to help you by bringing talismans to the altar, etc. Ha If you enjoy that type of thing, this book is probably for you. It just really took me off-guard. It does have some useful actual housecleaning tips mixed in with lists of detail cleaning to do for each room which I enjoyed. I could've done without the psycho-analysis. I much prefer the Sidetracked Home Executive books as well as Shine Your Sink. Those were practical and a bit more normal for where I come from!"
1,Zen Stupidity,"If I could rate this book lower than one star, I would. This has got to be the stupidest book I have ever ordered, and now it is definitely going in my re-sale bag.I wanted a book to help me find ways to clean my house--useful ways. I did not expect a book that would try make me aware of my inner beauty through housework. Phooey! Inner beauty is not having to do housework. And what does S&M and pornography have to do with cleaning your house?The practice exercises were even worse. As in preparing altars in your sanctuary. To my husband, this would mean a pile of magazines in the bathroom.Forget it. I'd rather use self-hynosis tapes for relaxation and have a maid clean my house."
4,Free at last!,It was a relief to read a book that deals with problems I've long ignored but always wanted to deal with. This book has stopped the procrastinator in me. By following the advice and exercises in it I'm finally getting myself together as well as my home. Bravo Ms. Robyn!
4,A poet from Arkansas,"About the time that this book of poems was published, Marcelle Chancellor Leath was the official Arkansas poet laureate. I met her, as a high school senior, at the Arkansas Writer's Conference. I treasure this book both because of her mentoring me and also because of its combination of vivid personal images (""I'd be ... woodsmoke, or if I thought it would please, I'd be rain at a cabin window, though I am none of these."") and awareness of the moral and social issues of the time.Dr. David Beebe"
3,Not as sharp as I wanted,These are OK scissors but not nearly the quality I was looking for. I wanted a pair of scissors to snip off those nasty little skin tags some of us get. These are NOT good enough for that purpose. Other than that they are pretty functional for first aid kits.
5,Pre school fun time,I bought this for my sister to use in her school and she seems to really like it.
3,Why can't hear it?,This cd will get ZERO consideration for purchase if I can't hear some of it first.
4,Don't overfill it,"At first, I thought that I was unlucky and I got one that leaked. The trick is to not fill it all the way up. Just fill it to the lower metal lip inside the opening. It has not leaked since and I am quite happy with it."
4,I wish there were 1/2 stars,"I bought this about 2 years ago. I've used it almost every day since.Like most, my workplace coffee is simply unpalatable. I needed a way to bring my own and have it stay hot all day.I make a full 8-cup French press of coffee every morning. I pre-heat the thermos with the leftover water I've boiled, which usually fills it about half way.It stays hot throughout the day, and if there's a significant portion of it left when I get home, it's been known to still be steaming hot.I'm giving it 4 stars (though, I wish I could do 4.5 because a whole star off seems drastic) only because if you pour too fast, like other reviewers have noted, it dribbles all over the place.The fellow that suggested the non-slip bottom... Thermos/Nissan, I hope you are listening."
3,"Not bad, if you like luke warm coffee","The nissan bottle keeps cold stuff cold really well, however it isn't the best at keeping things hot. It can't make it in a cold truck to the end of a day at work."
5,good book,"this book was a greak adventure, that said what was probly giong through a girls mind during the time of the Oregon Trail. It said how her family was close, but Mem who is the main character would rather do mans work, rather then do house hold work."
4,Wonderful historical fiction from a young girl's POV,"It's 1815, and 11-year-old Remembrance Nye and her family are heading for a new life in the wilderness of upstate New York. Uncomfortable with the idea of leaving her beloved extended family and the Connecticut farm on which she grew up, Mem is further discouraged during the family's long wagon journey. Within days of leaving home, Mem falls off the back of the wagon, unbeknownst to her parents, and wanders desperately through the forest until they realize they need to retrace their steps. Mean turkey ""drovers"" harass and attack the family; then Mama nearly drowns. What else could possibly go wrong?Yet amidst despair, there's always hope. The love and determination of the Nye family keeps them going, and young readers cheer them on in every chapter."
5,The Best Blend of Guitar Music Ever!,This Album is a truly insperational piece of work. Anyone who likes Guitar Music will love this CD. I would recomend this CD to anyone with a good ear to music.
5,Beautiful music,"My husband and I were in a restaurant in Flower Mound, Texas and heard this music playing. We loved it so much and asked the manager for information. I hurried home and researched the artist and discovered he lives right here in this area. This music is so beautiful and is very relaxing. You will not be dissappointed with this CD. I was very pleased to find it on Amazon because I have always had great experiences with my purchases."
1,Wrong CD,"This is a wrong ASIN Number.When you order this offer, you will get annother CD by Gerald Finzi, not the CD Kim/Starer"
2,Interesting and not at all practical,This book is a combination of sage advice and recipes. Most completely out of date or un PC. I don't know how the neighbours would feel about goose cooked alive! Actually this recipe is described as being archaic - rather than actually a good how-to recipe!It's another good social history book. There are some lovely guidelines about meat in season! Not much works in our present day.
2,not what I expected - requires assembly!,"I was expecting a regular 3.5mm right angle adapter..this is like a hollow shell with a bunch of little pieces and parts that they want you to put together inside. I am no electrician, or electronics expert by any means..I just wanted a plug n play..and this is NOT that.. seek elsewhere unless you really know what you're trying to order with this thing."
2,Wrong one :l,I ordered the black and gold plug but they sent the chrome one. I know it's not that big of a difference but it still bothers me.
1,BEWARE,"I bought this product and expected it would be as depicted. NO! It is a kit - actually it looks to be a replacement head for (I guess) an orginal head where the wires may have broken. Anyway, it is for inserting your own wires and then basically building a audio plug."
5,Great rebuild kit,"I broke my original headphone plug with a malfunctioning airplane 2-pin adapter. I'm kind of glad now since this is 90deg angle and works better on the plane and my iPhone.Easy to re-wire and closeout - no issues with intense use for about a year.Highly recommended.I have noticed some wear on the finish, but it looks good (no pealing)."
3,NOT Great Because...,"Even after perfect soldering of two different wires, I'm experiencing that annoying static sound when this plug is rotated in my phone or ipod. I purchased this plug for it's 90 degree angle, however, I have a few other ""cheap"" auxiliary cables that do no do this under normal use. The plug itself is of OKAY quality. An issue I noticed is that even when using a small gauge wire, the screw on part of the plug has a hard time closing all the way unless you shave off part of the internal plastic wire separator. The rubber sleeve is not durable and cracked at the opening within a matter of a few days. So long as I don't move my music devices, I love the durable FEEL of the plug. However, I wish it's performance lived up to the other reviews."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"I have always found the Blue Guides a reliable companion on my travels before, even several of Mr Robertson's works, but I am quite disappointed with the edition on Spain. Perhaps the subject can not be covered in a single volume as broadly as attempted here, but all the wonder of a beautiful and passionate land is lacking, reduced to a dry recitation of battle history and towns described as, ""bypassed, church has a Mudejar tower; opposite is mansion with 15th-century door."" This is such a shame in that no other series of guides attempts the serious examination of history, art and architecture that the Blue Guides do."
1,Worst textbook ever,"This was required for a class I took. It's part of a whole set of ""Mais Oui"" books and CDs. I found it to be the worst textbook I've ever had and I've used many textbooks. It is very disorganized and puts a greater emphasis on promoting feel-good, multicultural ideology than it does on teaching the French language. It is very condescending to the student and seems to be written for a elementary school class."
3,"Good read, but a few inaccuracies","I read this book when it first came out. As someone who's familiar with Aspen's team, and who's been involved in mountain search and rescue in Colorado for many years, I found Hal's book to paint a pretty good picture of what it's like to be involved in mountain rescue work.However, like a previous reviewer, I feel it's rather arrogant. Hal pumps-up Aspen's team while putting down other agencies, and I feel there are some questionable comments in the book related to this. There are many fine EMS agencies and rescue teams in Colorado (..and elsewhere) of the same caliber as Aspen's team. This book should have been more humble in that regard.Otherwise, I recommend it for anyone interested in this topic."
4,The Falling Season removes the glamour from rescue work.,"As an Aspen resident for thirteen years, I have been exposed to Mountain Rescue and its good works for a long time. Friends of mine are members and have encouraged me to join since I have the background and interest. I thought reading the Falling Season might provide me with the insight I needed to make a life-changing decision. It did.Hal Clifford's detailed accounts of not only the difficult and dangerous, and often emotionally overwhelming, rescue work but the politics within the organization and between the different emergency agencies in Aspen convinced me not to join.If you are considering a trip to the backcountry, Hal's book provides an excellent cautionary tale. Simple plans can and do go tragically wrong."
4,"Great story, but jumps around.",I am on a rescue squad so when I got this book I was very excited. I will say that I am not much of a book person but this book reeled me in. I thought that the story in itself was very interesting and relates to many rescue teams. However be prepared for the book to jump around a bit. I found myself adding words at times to make the sentences ledgeable. This was the only downfall to this book and it might be due to the publishers fault. So if you are interested in finding out what type of people it takes to be in SAR work this book points the way.
1,arrogant,It is unfortunate that the author fealt that the only way to make Mountain Rescue-Aspen look good was to simply find fault in the other agencies of the Roaring Fork Valley. Mountain Rescue has done many fabulous things through not only rescue but also education. Anybody who knows anything about technical rescue will find that the author simply points out mistakes made by other agencies and ignores all mistakes made by Mountain Rescue. The book was a fairy tale and ignored many facts of the rescues performed.
2,Look at the author,"As always, Keene's analysis is spotty most of the time, and fine occasionally, but never great and never for beginners. On the other hand, he does provide some interesting anecdotes. Buy this book if you're really interested in the match. But don't pay too much for it!"
1,it was all very bad didn't even shock!,It didn't even shock when I turned it on and when I tried changing the batteries it didn't even work!
4,Narrative theology & biblical study; our stories and the Bible's story,"Narrative theology. How narrative can enrich our understanding of the gospel. Explores how to faithfully use our own narratives to reflect upon biblical story. Author is professor of theology and ethics at Baptist Theological Seminary in Richmond, Va."
1,Do not waste money,"I wish I had read reviews before buying this product. I followed all the instructions to the T and this thing does not work. It you want to have a hot food, not cooked food this will do the job.I live in Texas and used it in the summer heat and full sun with outside temperatures in the 100's and my food got hot being out from morning till the sun went done and nothing got cooked, I could not even give that food to the dogs. Had to go in the compost. Strongly recommend against it. This product needs more testing and maybe better design."
4,Less Horror,"I like this one a lot more than I like the other Lomo. I have yet to see this type on clearance so I don't feel really bad about this impulse purchase. It has a rip cord so you can advance the film without injuring your thumb but on a recent trip to New Orleans, I got about 10 photos off a 24 exposure roll. Thats not good when I'm paying for 800 speed film (and not to mention that most film give you three extra exposures). I like the size of the frames and it looks better than the other Lomo. It shows off action shots a lot better and looks nicer too. But much more importantly, I didn't have to put on a band-aid."
4,Solid CD,"This is a solid i feel. I can feel the energy he put into this cd. I've been a PT fan for a while. He came right for this cd this is what he need. The other reference of track 13 is not true That beat 2pac stole from Aaron Nevil, for any one that really knows. Its a great CD and is worth buying. Its is a little short, but its still a great cd and no regrests buying it."
1,Dreadful,"I guess it could be said that my beef is not so much with Pastor Troy or with this particular album, but more with the genre of music from which this album came. To call this drivel ""hip hop"" is an insult to the term, this is generic mainstream rap that's failed to make it to the mainstream.If you like mainstream rap, by all means purchase this album, you'll probably like it. But if you're more tuned into Talib Kweli, Aesop Rock, Jedi Mind Tricks, Dilated Peoples, Murs, MF Doom, and so on, stay away from Pastor Troy at all costs. Stay far FAR away."
1,Unfair to teenagers who are starting to become one,i am a teenager who wants this software for the benefit of the dought that i want to become a landscaper the price on this is to much for my taste so i announce that it should be lowered to a fair price of nothing only because we being the customers should have a fair part in this. i should come and download this to my computer in order to full fill my dream in being one. i sugest that you are going to lose customers because of this. i hope you read my reason GOOD BYE ser or mam
1,Loads your PC full of AOL advertisements,"The software itself is not that bad. But what annoys me is that when you install the software, the program takes the liberty to clutter up your PC with advertisements on your PC. This, in my opinion is absolutely SHAMEFUL!! Not only this, but every time you install a different utility, the program re-installs all the advertisements.The software itself, as I said, is not terrible. But by no means is it the best."
2,"Very Cumbersome User Interface, but good program content","This software package is very complete, and appears to have good content. The user interface is very cumbersome, and difficult to work with. The landscape tool set is ackward, and makes the design process difficult. I have been working with it on and off for more than a month, and have yet to achieve good results. I will likely shelve the product and do my design on paper.Just my experience.... Hope my feedback is useful."
1,Bad software; don't bother,"The program is clumsy, and seems to be a rehash for newer operating systems that is still based on the old software core. That's probably why, despite the incredible graphics capabilities of PC's sold in the last three years, this thing is slow, slow slow. To do anything but simple tasks is frustrating beyond belief. I found it utterly irritating. You can choose from an existing palette of sinks, cabinets and other items, but customizing them is really not pleasant to do.The good news is that if you fold up the box, you can use it to shim a poorly leveled table. The cd makes a good coaster to protect the finish of the table, but watch for the hole in the center--condensation can drip through and mar the varnish.Save your bucks, skip this one unless you have a high frustration level and a lot of patience."
1,Don't Purchase!!!!,Although you are lead to believe from the cover that the original artist perform it isn't the case. These are all covers and not very good ones at that. I think that amazon should make that clear when they put it up for purchase.
3,The Book o Ki,The Book of Ki: The book's condition is fine. No problem...the material was not what i expected but i will use it..
2,"Where was the ""Passion"" ?","I gave this book 2 stars because I have loved most of Samantha James' books, but this was not what I expected. I did not like this book. Simon was a mess through-out and poor Anna just could not get a clue! I agree with ""Romancer"", NOTHING HAPPENS!!"
1,No plot & annoying characters,"While I've enjoyed this author's other books, this one was a real let down. The cast of supporting characters are annoying and simpering while there is no plot whatever. I began skimming whole sections in an attempt to get to anything good and have found nothing. The heroine is a snipey little girl in a woman's body and we are supposed to feel sorry for her as she treats Simon's past with selfishness. It's all about how she feels...arg. I'm glad I got this free from the library and its going back unfinished."
1,Almost unreadable,"After the enjoyable ""Perfect"" series, this is a big disappointment. Trite, predictable story and shabby writing. I can't tell you what happened at the end because I didn't finish it, but I wouldn't waste your money to find out."
3,It Was Okay......,"I liked Ms. James writing style always have but this wasnt as good as her Perfect Hero books. I felt compelled to finish reading it, because the characters had so much depth to me, although the store was a bit dry I was pulling for Simon amd Annbel to find their own happiness through the tragedy that befalls Simon. I finished with a contentment of sorts. If you are a hold hearted Samatha James fan go for it....if your trying her out for the first time I would recommend ""My Lord Conqueror"" or the Sterling Family serious trilogy ""A Perfect Bride"", ""A Perect Hero"" and ""A Perfect Groom"" and last but not least ""A Promise Given"" I believe these are better representations of Ms. James style..."
3,Nice chemistry,"I enjoyed reading the story of Anne and Simon's marriage based on one scandalous kiss. I like that they got caught right away and forced into marriage. So often that doesn't happen in Regencies. I did like the characters in general, though their inner monologues started repeating about halfway through the book. It got just a bit old. Overall, an enjoyable read with a lot of really nice chemistry between the characters."
5,simple,"these small zip ties are great for organizing your wires on your robot. or well, any of your electronics that you want permanent or temporarily ( you can cut them off, and you have so many, it is alright to do so) organized and not so unruly. i even color coordinated red on the power and black on ground. they are also fun to play with. connecting multiple pieces together can be horribly addictive."
5,Quality Product,"Very nice keyboad tray. I have been using this tray for over a year and it is still functioning superbly. It is very easy to move around, lock and unlock, and adjust the mouse platform. I have had issues with carpal tunnel over the years and this keyboard tray definitely helps alleviate some of those issues. If you need a quality keyboard tray, this one is it."
3,So-So,"This album is up and down. Some of the tracks are subdued, hypnotic, and have a really nice, subtle, tech-house quality. Others are self-indulgent and obnoxious (and not in a good way). I say buy the album, rip the songs you like, and resell it to your local CD shop."
2,Pretty Dull,"I listened to this (unabridged) on tape, and found my mind wandering a lot. These books are usually a fun read, but this one limped along. If I had read it, I don't think I would have made it through to the end. I thought the premise and characters were cliche and the plot was contrived, and I was very disappointed in the element of Annie's long-lost father. Having had an absentee father of my own, I looked forward to more mystery and conflict from this situation."
5,awsome,this game is unlike any other. it is unfit for my compliments it is spectacular. The graphics make it look like its real people going through this quest. Plus you get to do awsome jedi stuff like get lightsabers and upgrade them with crystals. also you get feats and jedi powers to help you in your quest but i have to say some parts do get hard but there is always a way with your team that you can chose and develop to be powerful people to defeat the enemy. But thats not all you can be good or bad so chose your side and fight.
4,Star Wars KOTOR Stratergy Guide,"Great product, really helpful and also very cheap for mint condition A++"
3,Gets the job done...,"...but that's about it. I mainly used this guide to familiarize myself with the game mechanics and details. That part of the book is pretty well done, although it could have been organized a bit better.Further down the road, I found this book to be more of a cheat-sheet, than a true strategy guide. I read the book after I finished certain parts of the game to make sure I wasn't missing any side quests. Beyond that, I only found it to be of limited use throughout the quests, because reading it would ruin your game experience. Of course, if you really got stuck, it might be helpful, but that didn't happen to me.The stats part is a bit disappointing. I didn't find it to be too useful. Overall, I would have wanted a bit more help with the overal game strategy. How do I go about making my light sabre most powerful? Not sure. It's as easy or hard without the book as it is with it."
1,Useless maps!,"I generally purchase guides like this one for the maps. Don't like to miss anything. The maps in this guide are located in one area, with a few annotations in the form of letters. The key to these letters is buried in text several pages away from the maps! I can't believe that anyone at Prima actually tried to use this guide.I recommend downloading the guide at gamespot.com. Although it does not have any maps, it is so well written and easy to use you won't miss them."
1,fairly useless book,"The maps were available to look at, but most of the events or special items that were denoted were impossible to discern from the text. As far as a walk through goes, I felt that the missing pieces of information were fairly aggravating. ooo, I found a box with a trap and a puzzle that appears to be based on information that is not available to me, what does the guide say about it? nothing. here's a list of bounties I can collect, how much are each worth? can I negotiate higher ones? what is the best way to persuade people? already I want to toss the dumb thing in the waste basket."
3,good but...,The strategy guide is good and it works but when i ordered it i ordered the computer version but received the xbox version. Like i said it works but it means i have to make mental conversions and i have found some disparities.
1,Not a dvd,"Asked 4 DVD sent VHS, was told I have 2 pay shipping not pleased, y should I pay shipping when it did NOT say VHS?I have the entire collection on vhs"
2,"Cheap, but that's about it","Bought this as a replacement for a Shure M95-ED because I loved the price. Unfortunately, it may be a case of getting what you pay for. Everything sounded a little flat, gauzy almost. A lack of clarity. Had to crank up the tracking force to get a sound closer to what I expect -- and that's a sign of a bad, after-market stylus. Better options are available online, though perhaps not on Amazon."
3,Not What I Needed,"I bought this because, I thought it would fit a Shure R47x cartridge. Although, it did not fit, it appears to be a fairly well constructed stylus for the price."
2,Bottle collapses,Very disappointed with this product. Not worth the price. After using the bottle a couple times the bottle collapses.
4,Anubian Lights - 'Naz Bar' (Crippled Dick Hot Wax),"Anubian Light's third full-length CD release and a bit different than their first two efforts 'Eternal Sky' and 'Let Not The Flame Die Out'(see my review of both). Best cuts here include the typical Anubian Light track ""What A Bagdad Had"",""In Flight"",""Out Flight"",the techno-like ""Hot Sand"" and the disc's fourteen-minute closer ""Outer Space Music"". Some might refer to this as 'total loungedelic'. Line-up:Tommy Grenas-guitar,electronics,bass,vocals and drums,Len Del Rio-synthesizer&loops and Paul Fox-SH 101. Worth checking out."
3,It's not bad...,"This album is NOT a snoozefest...but it's NOTHING new.If your in the market for Space Lounge, the ""Hed Kandi"" series is what your looking for."
2,Snooze Bar,Shallow retro electro sampling lounge wants you. Check brain before entering. Those with fear of flying or fear of tedium seek alternative sedative.
3,Nine Writers Discuss Various Ethnic Group Contributions To Baseball,"From the Anglo-Americans,to the Germans and Irish, Italians, Jews, Slavs,Blacks, Latins and Asians. This book traces the earliest players from each group as well as the stars. Most fans are probably aware of most of the modern players mentioned. But it's definitely helpful having all the groups covered historically in one volume."
4,*****,"Yet another great baseball effort partnered by Johnson. If you are truly a fan you will be familiar with Johnson and Glenn Stout from their masterful work on Red Sox Century. This is another well done, well researched work and I highly recommend it. For the rest of you New Yorkers out there, watch for Yankees Century to be out this summer in time for vacation reading. <Even if the Red Sox are still in first place!>"
1,100% RAILROAD SOCK,I am not happy with these socks I have only washed them 2 times and they are already coming unraveled around the top! They are super thin....They are suppose to be a work sock. Not Happy. Wish I could find some good 100% cotton socks.B.
3,Not 100% cotton,"These socks look good, but there are two small things that reduce their rating: 1) thgey are not 100% cotton, as the toes and heels are reinforcfed with nylon. For those who have medical reasons for not being able to tolerate any manmade fibers, like me, that could be a problem. However, the 0.5% nylon thus far has not manifested itself negatively for my feet. Let's hope it stays that way! 2) They tend to slip on your feet. If you spend most of the day in bare stockinged feet, you find yourself constantly pulling them back onto your feet, as they tend to keep wanting to slip off. However, the sock does stay upright on your calf. Thay also seem to get a rougher appearance after the first washing."
2,Work sock if you work in an office,"Very tin and light weight sock, with very thin elastic band at top only. The ""work socks"" title is deceptive."
2,going to charity,"I needed non-allergenic cotton socks. These may or may not have filled the bill. (They do have elastic tops, despite being sold as '100% cotton'.) But they are so ugly that I cannot imagine wearing them in public."
5,A must-read for anyone interested in wireless & electronics!,"This is my third copy of the RF Handbook. My technician friends in electronics all ask to borrow it -- and never want to return it!I highly recommend this book for anyone in wireless electronics. It answered all my questions in regards to RF communications and troubleshooting in a concise, detailed, easy-to-understand language. One of the great books in electronics.It's a keeper!John Favour"
3,Cool but lacks quality,"So I bought this for my nephew for his 1st birthday and had it sent to his house. My Sister called and said it was really cool and pretty heavy duty but they didn't send the screws to attach the ladders and some of the pieces didn't line up well. She said it was nice and heavy duty but lacked a little quality in craftsmanship. If they spent a little more time with attention to detail during production, this would be a 5 star item. Kind of a bummer for the amount of money. Oh well."
3,Firetruck Pedal car,"One of the wheels were bent & we had to fix it the best we could, other than thatit was good."
1,Poor concept overall,"I wanted to buy a pedal car for my 2 year old, so he would exercise a bit, not act like a handicapped using an electric car. Such car is hard to find in stores. Now I know why. It's a piece of junk. It took forever to put it together; in fact, the ladder and other accesories never made it, because the child couldn't wait to ride it. But then, big disappointment for everyone. He couldn't get to pedal it, because it's not a circular motion, so after a few months of frustration and his feet hurt, we took the pedals off, so he can use his feet directly on the ground. Then, one of the wheels started falling off and the steering wheel is all rusted after a year. This ride toy is extremely heavy, very hard to manuver and a total frustration for my child. So now I just bought an electric Jeep. My boy gets his exercise on the bicycle and razor."
5,fire engine,"my grandson was so happy when he saw the red fire truck.loves to ring the bell, not quite sure how to push down on the pedels yet but getting theirInStep Fire Truck Pedal Car"
5,Love this little fire truck.,"Bought this for my grandson for his 3rd birthday. He was thrilled when he saw it. The adjustable pedal length is a bonus as he will be able to play with it for a few years. It seems to be pretty durable so when he's outgrown it, his little brother will be able to enjoy it as well."
2,"Looks nice, poor pedal/drive design","We chose to get this fire truck pedal car for my son over another brand necause it looked ""more"" like a firetruck. We also got a pink princess pedal car for my daughter made by a different brand. For such a similar concept, it is amazing how the craftmanship is so night and day. My daughter's car by ""airflow collectibles"" has a very smooth flawless pedal operation and a very sturdy drive-wheel attachment. This ""in-step"" brand is not even close. The drive wheel is connected by a rectangular shaped axle nub that fits into wheel center. This was not even flush. the whole in the wheel was so muchlargerhat the axle that while rotating it bumps/jumps. (imagine lcothes in a front load washer. This same rough action occurs at the front end as well, the pedal bar mounts do not swing freely, and the front wheels wabble. We are not pleased."
3,"Interesting story, but slow read.",This is an interesting story but the author spends way too much time on the psychological aspects of why this woman was the way she was. There was too much time spent on Susan's childhood. Also how could the author have known some of the personal conversations that went on in this case.
3,Accurate & factual even if not well written,I was born and raised in the town of Warrenton where this book takes place. Granted the book does sensationalize the story (her side not Roberto's) I think that she does a good job of presenting what happened. I picked this up to see how well the story was told and to show to a girlfriend that moved to the area after the murder. I was not disappointed. Though not the most well written piece of literature the author does present the facts accurately and interestingly. Please remember most people in this small town are ashamed she is part of our history. This women is a person that you cross the road to avoid she gives off an aura or cruel elitism. We are not all like this!
1,"Trash, Not Truth","This book was nothing but a small tabloid. I was a very close friend of Roberto Villegas, and I don't believe that his story was ever told. The author concentrated on Susan and her Billions - just like the jury that tried her. This book is a cheap stab at the 15 minutes of twisted fame Susan received - versus the life sentence I believe she deserved."
1,Interesting story-too bad the author did such,a bad job telling it. This mass market book went right in the trash after I had finished it.
3,er...it's ok,"well, i agree with everyone, the traditional characters ARE way too small, and with no place names, wow, that's useful? however, why am i being so mean? it's a useful compact little thing, with BOTH pinyin and characters, so it isn't all bad. but if you're really serious about learning chinese, get a bigger dictionary, you'll be able to see better..."
1,Don't buy this!,"This was my first Chinese dictionary, but it has been passed over by time. Don't buy this dictionary, if you must buy an Oxford dictionary, go with the much larger and easier on the eyes edition (ISBN 0195911512). Even better yet, buy the ABC Chinese Dictionary (ISBN 082482766X), which allows you to look up by the alphabetized listing of the complete Chinese word in pinyin, not the two-step head character-second character system used on Oxford Concise."
3,Charecters too small,"The Chinese character strokes blur together to create ureadable solid black squares. Non Chinese readers cannot copy these characters, even with a microscope."
3,"Portable, and thus useful in some circumstances","This dictionary has no place names, a significant drawback. In addition, many characters, particularly traditional ones, are printed too small to see without a magnifying glass, and many are simply too small even with magnification - the printing process renders the character unreadable. Not terribly useful as a reference for serious writing."
2,Good story but hard to follow,"Being a mother of twins and also losing my mother at a very young age, I chose this book because I thought I'd love it and could really get into the srory.........WRONG. I didn't like the way the story jumped around SO much. Also it seemed like a bit too much jibber-jabber. But it actually was a good story and written from such a different angle; maybe if the ending would have been as ""different"" and extreme, it would have made me feel better about reading the book. This book took me longer to read than almost any book I've read. It's definitely not a page turner in my opinion."
2,Don't expect too much,"I bought this because none of the other more expensive ones had better reviews. I didn't have that much to loose. I made a rough draft of what my ""project"" room looks like and what I hope it will look like. One important thing to me was to see color changes. That feature didn't really work. There were other bugs in it as well. The furniture and accesories were limited, I had to really use my imagination. Although it was a little fun, this software was not very useful to me."
5,The most complete book ever,"I bought this book few years ago and I still using it. The book has all of the strokes explained in an outline form, very easy to read, and shown in clear dynamic drawing from front view to side view. The drawings ere actually a very unique way to show the strokes, may be not as clear as pictures, but nevertheless spectacular. This book is probably the only book you'll ever need, and is backed up by Nick Bollettieri, he highly speaks about the author."
1,Non-Stick seems to wash away!,These pans are really nice until you wash them. For some reason everything sticks as soon as you wash them and all I used is Dawn dish washing liquid. I bought 10 pans and it took me most of them to figure out what in the world was going on. Only have 1 pan left. Am very disappointed. Anyone know how to make a pan non-stick again. The coating looks to still be there but it sure doesn't work.
3,I expected tops like the ones on Texas Muffins- I'm Bummin'!,"I was so excited about the prospect of baking muffin ""TOPS"" thinking they would raise up like mushroom shaped yummy tops on Texas Muffins. As soon as I got my hands on that delivery box - I made muffins! They should call them ""Muffin Disk Pans"" because you end up with -""Muffin Disks"" They don't get big and puffy, they stay flat. They don't show pics of the muffins these pans make - they leave that tempting image up to your imagination. I ordered 4 so that I would always have a way to make what I pictured in my mind - can you say ""a whole lotta money for nothing special?"" The pans themselves are nice, non stick, and all that. I am trying to think of what I could make in them that would be impressive - maybe individual Brownie Bday Disks????"
4,Loved it,"The other reviewers were right. The surface is really non-stick, I barely need to use any cooking spray. I can even use this pan to make other things besides muffin tops. Very nice."
5,Great Gift!,"This was a gift for my sister-in-law for her wedding. She only likes the tops of the muffins and she bakes from scratch, so it was the perfect gift. Gret price, great quality, all around great item. I would buy these for myself, but I don't have the patience to bake!"
5,works great,For years I have been eating the tops off of muffins and now I can make only the tops and spare the waste. I've made a couple batches and they've turned out great.
3,crazy non-stick bottom,"Nicely heavy & very good non-stick coating.However, the pan is non-stick all over including underneath (huh?), so trying to get it out of a hot oven is TRICKY: Slips and slides all over! A textured handle--such as on OXO pans--would be great. Even a small ridge around the perimeter (like EKO pans) would help; anything a person could get a grip on through a potholder.The pan itself performed beautifully; the baking results were DEFINITELY 5 stars *****! But I'd rather grease & flour than deal with the trouble & danger of that crazy non-stick bottom. So 3 stars overall."
5,Much sought after muffin tops,"After a year long search, I finally discovered my muffin top pans at AMAZON.com Finally, I was able to get one for my 2 married girls.Love the price and the end product is great. Baking is fun."
1,DON'T BUY,"I have had this iron for over a year and it was great the first two months, but after that nothing but problems. Oh yeah it has automatic shut off, just this morning it shut off while I was ironing. Despite unplugging it, letting it cool, and plugging it back in again, it never got hot. The retractable cord worked the first two months, now I wrap the cord around the broken iron.Save your money, I am off to the store to buy an iron that works."
4,Vital historical perspective to modern day investors.,"This classic book is fascinating considering that it provides investor guidelines, both moral and technical, eight years before the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent depression. There are many rather prophetic statements such as ""You and I have set up a code of laws under which property and capital receive greater respect than health and happiness. But unless this is changed there will be a reaction that will wipe out the investments of many of us."" Alas! Would make a great addition to the library of any historian."
2,Why mess with a good thing?,"I discovered Lip Boost online while on assignment in the desert last year. I ordered it hoping to finally do away with the scruffy, chapped-looking lips I'd acquired sometime during week one, and it certainly delivered. The white cream was a little weird at first, but once it absorbed I was so happy with the soft, pinkish sheen I ordered one for each of my tent-mates!When I returned to the states, I wanted to restock, but found a disturbing ""New Improved Formula"" sticker on the package. I suspected the worst and sure enough, the new stuff is much more like Carmex in a tube -- a petroleum base with a whiff of menthol -- than the unscented cream I fell in love with.If you can't get some of the original formula, you may as well save yourself $7.00 and just use Vaseline."
1,Disappointed!,"I purchased this watch for my grandaughter. Upon receiving it, I tried it on my small wrist and the band was too short..the clasps did not even meet. When the gift was opened by my grandaughter, the same thing happened. We measured the band. It was only 6 inches, including the clasp! I was planning to return it, but the paperwork said there was a hefty ""restocking fee"" and I was obligated to pay the postage. Instead, I took it to a jewelry repair shop and they are trying to obtain some matching Pulsar links. I was told by the jeweler that some links had been removed prior to my receiving the watch! This is the first time I have been disappointed at an Amazon purchase. In this case, I am forced to conclude that I was sent a second-hand watch, instead of a new one. This is the last time I purchase a watch on this site."
5,Stunning debut,"FORCING AMARYLLIS is so accomplished, the fact that it is Louise Ure's first novel defies comprehension. Her characters are uncannily well-drawn, her imagery is splendid, and her narrative proves as haunting as the Arizona conjured forth--deftly, richly--on every page.This is one of those rare books that wasn't finished with *me* after I'd read its closing lines. My thoughts kept returning to Calla Gentry and Tucson for days afterwards--scenes and passages and bits of dialogue kept snaking through my head while I was waiting at stoplights or in line at the grocery store.Booklist has it exactly right: ""Ure's debut so compellingly evokes the hot, dry Southwest, readers may want to have an icy-cold glass of water nearby while reading it.""Whether your taste runs to crime fiction specifically or to fine writing in general, this is an author you'll want to keep tabs on. Expect to see Louise Ure's name featured prominently on this year's ""best first novel"" lists."
2,what is auhor is author trying to be?,"Had the potential, all the elements to be a good story, but the outline falls apart as you read on. Plot is implausible. This is a vulgur story, tormenting and sad because it's discussion of serial rape and not a ""mystery"". Seems the author had a finale she was shooting for and the plausibility of the actions that lead up to it are of secondary importance. Is she trying to be Patricia Cornwell?"
3,Good First Novel,"""Forcing Amaryllis"" is Louise Ure's first novel and it's a good start. Many people consider this one of the best crime/mystery debuts of 2005. It was recently nominated for a Shamus award for best first novel, and may get nominated for some other awards soon.I enjoyed this book, but it isn't perfect. The major problem I had was with the plotting. This book is REALLY slow in the middle, and doesn't really pick up until the last 100 pages or so. This book also contains very little suspense generally (until the very end). I also had some minor problems with the main character, who was likable but too angst-ridden for my tastes.Despite these flaws, this book is very well written overall. I very much enjoyed the descriptions of life in the Southwest, and I thought the trial at the end was very well handled. I therefore look foward to future books from this writer."
5,Writing Buddy Swoons,"I, like some others, have to say up front that I know Louise personally from a writing group. While I never got to hear the ending during my time in the group, she had me hooked immediately. Louise really hits the mark and all the well-derserved accolades contain no hype. No lulls in this read. It's delightfuly scary and wonderfully clever. I visited Tuscon for the first time last January and since reading her book, I feel like I have lived there. This book will be gifted to many appreciative friends."
5,Forcing Amaryllis,"This is my second book by this exceptional writer, after ""Liars Anonymous"". And this one is second to none; the best thriller (disguised as a novel) I have read, ever. I read it in one go, could not put it down; the personalities were fascinating, as was the search of the 'heroine' for the truth."
3,Probably help for sports,"I bought this to help build some strength in my forearms that was vey convenient. I figured it would help with lifting weights. Something you can pick up and do quickly. Thats true, its not much the distraction but the resistance is limited. I can use it on the maximum tension for a long time maybe around 10 min or more. Im sure it will help. I imagine it would help for sports a bit but I doubt it would be worth it to build muscle"
5,The secrets of the perfect Italian Restaurateur!,"This is a beautiful little cookbook, from Mauro the owner of one of the best Italian resturants I have ever had the pleasure of dining at. I was lucky enough to find a signing during the release of the book so I got to have Mauro personal it.The recipes inside are fantastic! It will take a while to try cooking them all, but I will get around to it.So try the resturant, then buy the book. You will not be disappointed with either."
2,Horrible DVD,"This DVD is awful! Do not waste your money. Whoever created it doesn't know much about children. I have two kids and babysit two kids. Their ages range from 18 mos.to 5 years old. None of the kids liked it. They would not watch it past the letter C! The music is bad, the exercises are mostly silly & useless and the guy in it is strange & creepy. His voice is actually very annoying. There's nothing fun or catchy about this DVD."
1,Cheesy and made my 2 year old cry.,"Worst money I ever spent. This guy must have made this video in his basement. Quality is poor. Not really much exercise. Hoped my 2 year old would warm up to it and get into it, but the creepy guy freaked him out."
3,It's worth buying used,Half of the games in this book are good but the other half of the games are pretty much retarded. It's worth buying used.
2,A DISAPPOINTING REISSUE,"The artwork for this CD shows it to be part of the Archive Series of Le Hot Club De France, manufactured and distributed in the USA by BMG Music. So one is entitled to have high expectations of the result, particularly when the liner note uses the phrases ""lovingly remastered"" and ""previously unissued recordings"".In the event what we get is the result of the first five productive 1928 recording sessions (but only one of the three alternative takes), the one title issued from June 1929, the somewhat explicit May Alix vocal from the following month, and a 1923 King Oliver recording on which Noone may have been present. Transfers are adequate although the pitch of the first track sounds flat to my ears, and very little work has been expended on presentation. Add to that a playing time of around 45 minutes and the result is a big disappointment."
5,Agile AL 2000,"I bought this guitar back in December 2005 and have been learning to play on it. I absolutely enjoy it more everytime I play it, which is nearly everyday. Of course the better I get, the better it sounds and it so sooooo cooool when you get parts of Beatle's songs just right. Beautiful finish, and excellent craftmanship, this is not of piece of junk, this is a serious guitar, this could be sold for a lot more money. I read reviews on numerous sites before buying and was kind of skeptical of all the raves about it, even by the more experienced musicians who bought it for ""fun"". They weren't kidding, it is good instrument."
3,okay for the price,"I bought these for my [...] daughter, they are very cute. The reception through the house is not all that impressive. They are a little bulky for little hands to hold. They are okay for a first time walkie-talkie purchase for the price."
4,Castle fans will want to see this,"As a fan of the show Castle this video really changed my mind about one of the main actors in the series. I won't reveal which one - watch it and you decide. Even with that I really enjoyed the little bit of inside access this DVD gives. It's a nice way to ""meet"" all of the main players in what is a terrific show that I can't wait to see each week."
1,The worst quality I have ever seen on a DVD!,"Having seen tidbits of this panel online I was intrigued and wanted to see the whole thing, upon finding it available for purchase I was beyond thrilled, even though I didn't particularly care for the price tag. The panel didn't disappoint, but I was utterly appalled by the quality of the footage.It was heavily pixilated and completely awkward to watch - I've seen home videos dating back to the 80's with better quality - so to be expected to pay 20$ for this and get such crap quality in return is utterly appalling to me.I can only hope the contribution from me and others who have purchased this DVD will go towards updating the Paley Center's camera equipment so that future panels will be filmed on equipment dating from THIS century. Until that happens I will not be purchasing anymore DVDs from them - it's NOT worth the money."
1,A disappointment,"This DVD takes faded trailers from major motion pictures and attempts to recut them into a documentary. The end result is underwhelming. The ""interviews"" provided are minimal to the extreme."
4,Easter Parade,"This movie in today's world becomes somewhat of a fantasy and as such, takes viewers out of the horrors that surround us, and for a short time recalls happiness and decency. What else can one say."
4,So far so good,"After reading mixed review, I took my chance. I followed other peoples advise:1. Do not use silencer.2. Do not tinker with the safety switch. Keep the safety switch to always off.It works quite well.Here are couple of points that no one has mentioned so far.1. The slide is made from plastic. I was hoping for a metal slide.2. Weight inserts are in the grip and the magazine which makes this gun bottom heavy. The real Glock 17 is well balanced in terms of weight.Build quality of this gun is OK as you would expect from a $26 gun. I may update this review after some use and comment more on the reliability.By the way do yourself a favor if you are going to shoot BBs in your home, Buy this:Crosman Airsoft Sticky Target"
4,Excellent Sidearm,"I think this is an excellent sidearm for wars in close quarters combat, and I will list why...Pros:StrongLong RangeEasy to load clip, holds aprox 16 rds, speedloader recommendedFunCons:Silencer sucks, doesn't work at all, only hurts itOrange tip will fall of easily, I recommend somehow jamming it into the barrel, don't block the barrel thoughThere is a little cover plastic part that is visible, if your gun starts to jam a bit, I recommend ripping it off, won't hurt the gun, this is how I fixed mine.I got this gun about two weeks ago, has worked great ever since."
2,glock 17 airsoft gun,"the gun lacks on power alot. the slide catchs even when theres BBs in the gun.when i used the silencer it got stuck on the barrel and the only way to get it off was to snap it off :( then the barrel broke so it slides in and out of the gun :0 BUT the gun looks sick.it shots strat,the sights r kinda nice and the mag release is easy to use. the mag its self is nice too,mag is full metel and holds about 15 rounds. its a cool gun but unless its just to look at or for acting get it other wise if ur a air softer who dosent play with cheap spring guns then do not get it!"
1,Dang it,I waited 5 days to get this only to find that it was out of stock. I even checked it 2 hours before and it said it was in stock!(i have no idea what the guns like thanks to amazon)
2,Shoots okay but otherwise cheaply made,"I bought this for my son. It arrived with a slide cover that was broken. I couldn't fix it so just took the part out. It shoots okay but looks funny without the part I had to remove. Overall, it seems pretty cheap."
2,"Broke in a week, but very realistic and heavy.","I got this gun and it shoots a whopping 100-125 fps. It broke in about a week. The good side is that it is metal, very realistic, and has a good heavy weight.This gun is for looks but not for Airsofters."
5,Nothing else compares,"I have read this volume several times. Each time I read it, it moves me beyond what mortal life can do. Through the first half of the book, I feel light and carefree as if it strips my sorrows. After the end, I drip into the bleakest, blackest melancholy, despair unlike any other. After a period, My despondence lifts and I feel free. I am cleansed of all human pressures and woes. I highly value the tome for it's pure unadulterated emotions."
4,Very helpful.,"This book helped my friend and I to obtain the Boiler operator license for the County of Los Angeles. Great book, to the point and very detailed information on formulas to calculate (BHP), Temp. conversions, Glossary, and at the end of each chapter a trade test."
4,HELPFUL,"I think this book is very helpful in studying for license exams. I earned my High Pressure Boiler Operator's License from the City of Detroit with the help of this book. The diagrams and explanations were very good. I would recomend reading this book to get an overall understanding of plant operation, not for indepth explanations."
5,"more like, The Amazing Rock-A-Lots","This CD is fantastic if I do say so myself. Geek rock at it's finest. They put the ROCK in geek rock, no doubt about it."
2,Just not that good,"Some years after releasing the Amber Rulebook, Shadow Knight came out. The Amber Rulebook spawned a legion - small but rabid - of players of the game, and Shadow Knight was eagerly purchased by said players.As one of those players, I cannot help but be disappointed by the book. It's not because I don't like the source material (the 2nd chronicles), but it's because the book is just disappointing.It's too little, too late. Anyone who is a serious Amber gamer already had their own rules and variants worked out, and the sourcebook doesn't seem to really be above them. I find it a lot worse in fact.It's useful for the odd idea about adding to the game of Amber, but only buy it if you're a junkie who has to have everything on the topic."
1,Poor item description,"I was really steamed when I received this. The description does NOT tell you that the patriot CDs are only for sailors and soldiers from Massachusetts! Since my ancestor was from South Carolina, I would not have wasted my money on this had the description been accurate."
4,Compelling Thesis,"Horowitz is a relentless thinker. He approaches this work in his normal manner. His thesis, that Democrats know and wage political war better than Republicans, is worth careful thought. His Six Princples of Politics that the left understands and the right does not is not to be missed. Toward the end, he tends to wonder off his thesis, but nonetheless, a must read for all serious politicos."
4,Sun Tzu of the 21st Century,"Former Congressman James Rogan calls David Horowitz the ""Sun Tzu of the twenty-first century."" He may be right. This book teaches conservatives the very techniques that the left has perfected for decades. Endorsed by Karl Rove, this book is an excellent read for any conservative who wants to learn how to win."
2,To arbitrary for my taste,I feel that the book The art of political was is a bit arbitrary. The book throws a lot of the blame at the democrats making republican look like innocent bystanders. Some of the examples and facts are thin at best. I'm still looking a book that will provide full review of the political system in the USA.
3,"Starts well, ends oddly","I really enjoyed the beginning of the book, where Horowitz covers the ways and means of political war. In the chapters that followed he showed examples of the principles in action, but then began to drift.By the end of the book he'd returned to a recurring theme: his involvement with, and separation from, the Black Panther Party. By then it was far from obvious how any of this might fit in with political war. On top of which, if you've read his other books and his Salon columns you've already seen this material a number of times.So, three stars. Don't get me wrong. I think DH is a great man. This is just not one of his greatest works."
3,So-So,"I loved ""The Descent"" and can't help but admire Mr. Long's wild and wooley imagination, but this one misses the mark, especially toward the climax. I had hoped for another madcap pulp horror experience (for that, go read Harry Shannon's 'Night of the Beast')but souldn't help but be disappointed that I spent the money for a hardcover. Just so-so."
3,Not as Good as Descent,"Something about this didn't quite work for me. Descent had real tension to it, but this one didn't quite have it. Maybe Jeff Long got a bit frightenned about offending anyone considering the religious theme. It also shares tha sme premise as Michael Cordy's 'The Miracle Strain', which again didn't really deliver for me."
2,Well thought concept . But a drag,The story was very interesting till it got really boring. There was no ending to the story. May be the author wasn't sure how to end it.. May be the author wants to publish Part II Year Zero.. Every possibility for not ending story came into my mind when I finished it FINALLY.
1,Horrible book!,"You want a neat version of this book, check out The Genesis Code by John Case. This book (Year Zero) is long, boring and depressing as heck at the end. Why should you even care anymore by the end of the book as the world is systematically wiped out by the plague?I'm not giving away any more than the back cover of the book when I say this either - the whole ""Jesus"" subplot is left completely unanswered.Really clever idea for a book, but needed someone else to write it. It is just terrible. I have a tendency to finish bad books because some of them develop into ok book, plus there is that ""already invested"" feeling. This book was not worth finishing. The bad thing is I apparently ordered Descent at the same time. Oh my..."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"After reading The Descent, I was avid to read Year Zero. The premise of the search/cloning of Jesus was so intriguing! Alas, the book lost the premise and turned into a scientific journey with less than interesting characters, underdeveloped plots, and an ending that left me with a smirk on my face and the thought that I was seriously misled.The book does have many good moments...it's basically a good read but if you're interested in relics and the religious conotations, you won't get it here.I'll give his next book my attention, but if it fails, I'll know he was a one hit wonder."
2,Zero believability,"I can really only review the first half of the book, because it went in the trash can at that point. It could have been a winner but for the unfortunate lapses into fantasy. It is supposed to be a bio-thriller, but anybody that has any familiarity with the subject is going to find it hard to believe you can clone a completely grown, aramaic speaking jew from a 2000 year old fleck of blood soaked into a splinter of wood. Humanity being less resistant to a virus now than then is also hard to take.I do hope he tries again. He has a good style."
2,What is it?,"I don't think Jeff Long really knew where he was going with this one. Lot's of scenes transferred from other works (Outbreak, Cliffhanger, Timeline, Sum of All Fears, Road Warriors, Deep Impact, The Mummy, Seven Years in Tibet, Sparatcus, The Boys from Brazil, etc, etc -- it's a long list). He makes an effort to tie it together, but it doesn't wash. Characterization is good, just good enough to know that you don't really care about the people. He started out with a good premise but sold it down the river in an attempt to reach a higher philosophical level. It didn't work. The dialog is forced and the story, although physically going to a lot of places, really goes in circles and really gets nowhere, climaxing in a soft whoosh. Nothing resolved after much ado about nothing."
2,Awesome book! But how bout an ending? Forget to write one??,"The book was awesome! The adjectives used to describe the surroundings were great! There were many typos in the book, however. Not a biggie. I can overlook that. But, uh.. what about an ending.. the last page left me wishing for another to turn to explain lose ends. Don't buy the book. Borrow it."
2,Long can do better,"'The Descent' was riveting, scary, and seemed all too real. I was hooked from the first page.Conversely, 'Year Zero' isn't compelling. Having steeped myself in post-Apocalyptic works by reading 'The Stand', I find 'Zero's characters shallow and unsympathetic with the possible exception of Nathan Lee Swift. Ochs is a caricature; there's the requisite deformed mad scientist; a girl genius with no heart at all. (She creates a creature, knowing it will surely be destroyed once discovered.)In attempting to cover a broad period of time and place, the book doesn't dwell for long on one place or one person. The plague itself is never described or shown long enough to create the sense of horror, dread, and end-time that we need to feel.In the end, I could never grab hold of any of the characters for long. In the end, even Nathan Lee shook me off his coattails."
2,Dull dull dull,"Too many plotlines, too much ""tight"" editing, and almost completely disinteresting, unbelievable characters doom this book.The apocalypse which the editorial teasers feature so prominently really are secondary plot devices to the primary conceit: the cloning of Jesus. And even that the writer reduces to pulp fiction status with his attempts at fine writing.The Stand and Swan Song are better survival books, and almost anything by Crichton is better than this.Heck, anything by Stine is better than this."
2,Dissapointing follow-up,"Having loved ""The Descent,"" I was extremely excited for ""Year Zero."" The opening sequence and the general concept for the novel did not dissapoint. However, Long's efforts to bring the story through 400 pages and to a conclusion become so muddled and misguided that I actually started skimming. None of the conflicts ever rise to a dramatic climax and many storylines are simply forgotten about. Great idea. Terrible execution."
1,Extremely Slow,I was very dissappointed in this book. It is so slow..I still haven't finished it. Jumps around so much you can't tell up from down. Not worth your effort.
3,Good......but not great!,"The concept is great...but for me the story fizzled out in the second half,and the ending was a little disappointing."
1,Falls far short of its initial promise,"An interesting premise which starts well. The author starts off with great gusto but appears to just ""give up"" at the end. Story lines and characters who appear to be critical to the storyline seem to disappear or fade away without even attempting to tie up loose ends in any meaningful way. And the ending? Please. It was like the author just got tired of writing this story and said, ""OK I'm done"". Very unsatisfying. If it was only based on the first part of the book I'd buy every book he writes. But if you can't finish a story in a meaningful way then I doubt I'll ever buy another one of his novels. Too bad. I really had hoped to like it."
3,Overall a good book,"This book is a good read. However at sometimes the book got boring, and at the end just like another reviewer said, it just leaves to much up at the end. Still if you into this genre you would like this book, if not do not read it."
2,Disappointing!!!,"I agree with the other comments listed earlier. The story line concept is good and the first 200 pages were captivating. Once you past the half way mark, the whole story just collapses. I found the character developement extremely weak. You cant feel for any of the characters. It took me 2/3 into the book to realize who the main characters are. Overall disappointment!"
4,A little different than I expected.....,"but still good. The thing about Jeff Long is that he could cut about 150 pages out of every one of his books and they would be perfect. There is a huge drag in the middle that doesn't go anywhere, The Descent was similar, but still a good novel. Although Long does a great job of tying everything together perfectly at the end of every novel.There is nothing unique about the premise of the story, which is about a plague that eliminates most of mankind. Long tackles some religious themes that make the story very interesting."
3,Anticlimatic,"I picked up this book because I really enjoyed the Descent. However, this book left an unfullfilled feeling. Long explores too many stories, which don't come together until the very end. Half way into the book, I found myself skipping pages just so that I could get to the end. The book felt 90% introduction and 10% actual resolution of the plot. And once the plot came together and was resolved, it was anticlimatic at best. Long set himself up for failure by introducing so many characters, who at the end seem trivial to the whole story. Pick this book up only if you enjoy very very slow story development."
3,"Elated, then disappointed","Until the end, this was the best book I had ever read. There was so much promise, but so much left hanging at the end. It is OK to leave some things unanswered, but I felt cheated and disappointed with the end of this book, as if it needed another hundred or so pages to wrap everything up. That said, it is still worth reading, but expect to be left hanging like at the end of a Steven King movie. I recommend ""Conquest of Paradise: an end-times nano-thriller"" as an alternative. It was a far superior novel."
1,Year Zero,"The premise of this novel gripped me, yet the multiple plots never seemed to go anywhere. The back cover implies this book is about the clone of Jesus, yet that was not the case. One of the main characters is described early in the book in such a way as to make her seem sociopathic, yet she becomes ""normal"" two years later to become Nathan Lee's lover...and yes, I agree about the name! There were just so many avenues this tale could have taken, yet it went in too many unbelievable directions and I found it difficult to follow. It was also difficult to believe that the rest of the world was wiped out, but North America, host to millions of travellers every year, was unscathed until the end. Given the reviews and comparison to Dan Brown's work, I was very disappointed."
3,"Pretty good, but The Descent is much better","I bought this book because I enjoyed the author's ""The Descent,"" and while it is a fairly good book, ""The Descent"" is much better. With the increasing price of paperbacks, this is one I'd recommend you get from the library instead of buying - if you love it, you can always buy it later, right?"
3,"Great concept, but as for the ending: Disappointed!","I must admit, the talents of Lincoln and Child have ruined me. This is an excellent concept, and had they written it, it would have been fantastic. It was still a good read ... right up to a disappointing ending. I want my happy ending, the rabbit pulled out of the hat, the thing I did not see coming ... but it just didn't happen, although I won't write a spoiler. There were some great scenes, characters that you wanted to know more about, people and places that were remarkable.This simply won't be a reread because the ending was not up to par with the rest of the book. In my opinion, anyway."
3,Strong start..disappointing ending,Save it for a visit to the library. If there was only a way to buy the first half of the book.
2,disappointing,"This was recommended by Amazon based on my so-called tastes. I was so disappointed. It is not so much a post-apocalypse book as a book on cloning. I pretty much didn't care about anyone in the book - even the female 'lead' character who was beautiful but immoral. And that's what the author seems to be saying: cloning without morals or compassion is evil. I can agree with that, but it doesn't make for a 'good' story."
2,A lot of sound and fury signifying nothing,"i found myself fairly engrossed in this book, but by the time I finished it, I felt empty. The plot is great, but then, the author isn't exactly making that up on his own given the fact that it comes from the Bible. I picked this book up hoping for something as engaging as Brian Caldwell's We All Fall Down, but this doesn't even come close to that standard. It's better then Left Behind in that the writing is quite good, but the author just doesn't seem like he has anything to say, no point to make, and that was a big disapointment."
2,A real let down,"I really enjoyed Long's previous book, and was looking foward to reading this with great anticipation. I was shocked at the poor level of quality of Year Zero. Long writes a simplistic good vs. evil story with no shades of gray and, concequently, no tension or intelligence. If you want to read a great doomsday novel, try The Stand by King or We All Fall Down by Caldwell. Both are intelligent and gripping- two characteristics that this book do not have."
3,ENDING????,"I enjoyed parts of this book. Actually I enjoyed pretty much all the book, until the end.....Where was the end???Was my book missing pages? I guess I just like to have closure after reading a 500 page book. I did really enjoy the 100 pages in the middle that dealt with the community of hebrew clones, but with no ending it seemed like a waste of time."
3,"Ok story, but a deceiving back cover","Just a forewarning to all who are thinking about getting this book, the back cover has you believe that Jesus Christ is Patient Zero, and that he has a large role in the story. Not true. His role, if any, is one of a background character. Other than that, it was an interesting read."
1,Hours I will never get back,This is the only book in the past twenty years that I have actually stopped reading before I finished it. The prose is amatuerish at best. Mr. Long desperately needs to take some creative writing classes at his local junior college.
3,"Great Concept, Boring Book","The whole idea of the book is very fascinating - a plague from Christ's time and place, cloning of his contemporaries, or even of Jesus himself, developing apocalypse, but the author could not implement it right. Although the first part is quite interesting, the second part is outright boring and I had to force myself to finish the book. Despite all the efforts the cure was not found so the book does not even have an end. I finished reading with feeling of emptiness and desire to know what would happen after the book's end."
5,One Great Dual Exhaust Kit,"PROS: This Gibson ""cat back"" dual exhaust system is well engineered, with precision bends and high quality welds... The heavy gauge aluminized steel tubing should give years of service... Installation took less than 2 hours with basic mechanic tools, after removal of existing exhaust system... This kit is supplied with all the necessary parts for complete and uninterrupted installation... The twin outlet muffler is designed to emit the pleasing sound of performance while, most importantly, maintaining the minimum required amount of exhaust system backpressure to allow the engine computer to operate correctly... i.e. No dash engine warning lights displayed after installation... And those two stainless steel exhaust extensions under the rear bumper of my short bed Silverado look really good ...CON: NoneCONCLUSION: One can not go wrong with this dual exhaust kit... Especially from Amazon.com with their Prime ""One-Day 1-Click""..."
4,I love this DVD but it should have more,"I thought that I was buying the WHOLE season of American Idol when it was on some of the best performances, but the good thing is that there is alot of behind the sence stuff."
4,My Review,"I have the DVD, and I bought it off the American Idol website. I think it is a cool DVD. It has an abbreviated (one hour to be exact) version of the entire series. Most of the ten finalists have at least one song on this. It also has some ""Behind the Scenes"" footage. I reccommend this to anyone who is an American Idol fan. I do not reccomend this to anyone who is not. I hope this helps!!"
3,I'm depressed by this,"I was very excited about the new American Idol DVD, and then was immediately disappointed that it was nothing but a cheap montage of the 2002 season. There was really no added commentary, no bloopers, no priceless moments. Then I realized, all at once, how sad a human being I truly am--for sitting there in my pajamas and hoping for some added tidbit of sordid human embarrassment. The DVD was a downer, but I've decided to change my life. Tomorrow I begin jogging and eating right; and I'm going to stop wearing those miserable sweaters that Simon always wears."
5,American Idol,"I think this is a great video. It features Ryan, Christina, RJ,Tamyra, Nikki, Justin, and Kelly's best songs. It was perfect. I really enjoyed watching it. There is one big complaint I have though. It wasn't longer."
3,Should have been a Season 2 disc.,"Now I like American Idol as much as the next person, but i have to say, when I look back at season 1 I see how untalented most of them were. What this disc is, is a feature program featuring the entire season pushed into about an hour. Hence the first problem. You dont even see 4 of the 10 finalists perform. The performances you do get to see are Ryan Starr, 2 from Justin, 2 from Nikkie, 4 from Kelly, and the ultimate American Idol performance, past, present, & future, Tamyra Grey singing A House Is Not A Home.Some extras include a lot of wacky auditions, the Pasadena experience, and a tour the idols home. The second disk is pointless. Its mostly a bunch of producers talking about the show, not to mention an embarasingly stupid segment with Justin Guarini. They need to get rid of this cheap stuff, and come out with a full season dvd package. Fox would be making some money then."
1,DIsappointing,"Hardly any performances. If you watch this video, you would wonder why the show was such a hit. All of this video could have taken place in 1 night. There was no suspense, no tension of watching your favorite move on or move out. And the 2 DVD set is an even BIGGER disappointment. In Simon-speak, it's dreadfully, absolutely dreadful!"
1,"Terrible content, terrible quality","Most of the reviewers have summed up the terrible content of this DVD, so I'd like to comment on the quality of the video footage itself. The sound quality is terrible! I had to watch the DVD with my finger on the volume control the entire time. Basically, it would go from blaring loud to whisper quiet (there were a few scenes that I couldn't hear any of the )conversation with the volume turned way up. Sure, I bet they were in a hurry to get this one out, but don't waste your time and money watching it."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is just highlights. It is almost all talking. I liked the show because of the signing. I bought this because I wanted to have all the great songs they sang on DVD. But there is very little singing. Instead of showing RJ singing ""Lately"" to get into the top ten. They tell you how good of a job he did. Don't waist your money like I did."
5,Justin made this show a success,"This DVD is awesome simply because it features Justin Guarini. Sure, I love all the kids, but the simple fact is, I watched and voted only for Justin! He has something that draws you to him, and a beautiful voice of course. He is the best thing to come along since sliced bread! Seriously, I now know what beatlemania felt like...and thank you god for bringing Justin to all of us! Get this DVD! A day in the life of Justin is reason enough at last. This is coming from a 30 yr. old woman, by the way! He brings out the 12yr old girl in me, what can I say!"
4,AWSOME!,I love this video because it shows all of my favorite American Idol contestants. You should buy it because it has all of the best moments from the show. It even shows behind the scences footage of all the contestants.
1,What A Disappointment!,"I purchased this DVD and boy was I disappointed. The production looks like it was a rushed job. Very little content and no substance. The only information I got out of this is that the final contestants of AI2 were so much better than those of AI1. I watched this once and have no desire to watch it ever again.I am looking forward to an AI2 DVD but I hope they would do a much better job than the above-mentioned DVD. Of course being a Clay fan, I hope to see more of him in the DVD.For now, I can only say that the AI1 DVD is a disappointment and a complete waste of my money."
4,ugh,"OK for all the freaks who hate shows like american idol get a life! quit bashing! stop watching the show! Amereican idol has found amazing singers if you disagree go listen to bad talent like avril lavigne, shes sucks!. now this DVD is overall good. ttyl!"
3,AMERICAN IDOL A GREAT SUMMER SHOW BUT...,AMERICAN IDOL WAS A GREAT SUMMER SHOW. WHO WOULD WANT TO SEE A REPEAT PERFORMANCE? MAYBE A DIEHARD FAN? I RECOMMEND THE DVD TO ANYONE WHO DIDN'T SEE THE SHOW THIS SUMMER. KELLY WAS A DESERVING WINNER BUT I PREDICT TAMYRA GRAY WILL BECOME A STAR...SLASH THAT COMMENT ... SHE'S ALREADY A STAR.
3,Where is there a pinhead?,"I like you, you beatuful but has no lice. My favorite song, Snappy Relations, makes glad my kid but not so much Low Rider. Low Rider has favorite ending, Dennis Hopper did good mock up. Oh boi! I have no Kelly Clarkson pictures on my wall, I have no pleasure! Simon needs torture, possibly paper-cutting his pee-hole and sprinkling salt into his oh boi! Explosive, snappy cutting and editing sound colleges, I attend no university any more, highlight."
1,Very Disappointing,"I was a HUGE fan of the show, and had been excited for this dvd. I wish now though that I hadn't wasted my money. I was hoping for performances, auditions (especially wanted to see the bad ones,) all the stuff that made the show good. What did I get? A thrown together piece of [stuff]. First of all there are only a handful of performances (not even the good ones.) Second, the thing isn't even edited very well. It is just thrown together. It doesn't have performances from everyone, but it had all the cheesy ""goodbye"" clips from all the contestants. This DVD could have been great--what were they thinking?!?"
2,American Idol DVD - Not Up To Par,Not enough behind the scenes footage of the contestants. And when will the producers realize that WE DON'T CARE ABOUT BRIAN AND RYAN!!!!!?????
1,Rip Off!!!,"I just received the DVD as a gift and was hoping to see the ENTIRE SEASON because I had missed a couple of shows. However, it turns out that the DVD just contains some clips of various highlights and omits some of the best parts of AI. I too, was really hoping for Kelly's Big Band Performance and was sorely disappointed. The DVD packaging also claims to have Complete Finalist Auditions and while there are clips of each of the finalists during their original audition, we never get to hear them sing! As for the rest of the songs, forget about it. The choices are odd and some of the best songs were ignored. I can't believe it! It's not like they're going to show reruns, so find someone who taped all the shows and borrow them before you buy this DVD."
1,"Don't Waste Your Money, This DVD [is Terrible!!]","This is only the highlights, they did such a bad editing job!! It's totally not worth it!! They only show 3 seconds of everything, i want my refund!!"
1,Very Little Content... Not Worth Buying,"I am a big American Idol fan but only saw a few episodes from the 1st season. I bought this DVD because I wanted to find out what happened on the episodes I did not see. This DVD was so disappointing. There is only about an hour and a half of footage and you only get to see a few performances. Really lame!I am so sick of these TV shows putting out ""highlights"" DVDs. There is so much more to show and I for one would be willing to pay a lot more for complete seasons (like some shows are starting to do). Even if it is only one disc... you can fit a whole lot more than an hour and a half onto 1 disc.I would not recommend this DVD to anyone. There is so little content and if you watched only a little bit of American Idol last year you are not going to see much more here."
3,Dissapointment,"This DVD does give a recap of the show, but it still [is bad]. I got this as a gift and when I read the back it seemed really neat because it claimed to show the finalists full aditions and everything, but when I put it in, I searched all the bonus footage and watched the actual ""show"" and only found clips of the finalists but not very much singing at all. The producers obviously were in a rush to get this DVD out in stores because the just didn't put in a lot of the good performances. The only good part I say would be is the trivia footage, and that too was only about a minute long."
2,Focus was wrong,"I ordered this video expecting to see a lot more of the contestants singing. Instead the focus seems to be who left the show each week. I feel like I saw more of the hosts than of the contestant's performances. It would have been nice to see more of the great performaces and to hear the contestants singing in the background as they talked about them. 4 of the top ten were not shown giving performances. It would have been nice to see them perform, especially R.J. who finished 5th."
3,its ok,"I just bought the DVD yesterday and a watched EVERYTHING that was on it and it doesn't even have any RJ performances, it only has little clips from each show, but it does have a TON of extra stuff on it, there's bloopers, they go inside the mansion, they have so much funny stuff! I think everyone who liked the show would like the DVD."
4,The Search For A Superstar,"I bought this d.v.d. a couple of years ago and I really loved it.The only problem was I was expecting the whole season and I didn't get that.That's why I only gave it 4 stars!It is the length of 1 episode.I love the bonus features and the bonus disk!They really rock!It has amazing performances from:Kelly Clarkson,Justin Guarini,Nikki McKibbin,Tamyra Gray,Christina Christian,and Ryan Starr!It's worth the cash!I wish they would create a d.v.d. like this for seasons 2 and 3!"
3,for the fans,I would say this won't appeal much to people who don't like the show. it is about as entertaining as an episode of the show.
2,this is 1 DVD NOT 2 !! Incorrect picture!,"This is only a single DVD. The photo posted is incorrect. If you order, do not expect the 2 DVD's that are shown in the photo."
3,Leaves you wanting more!,This DVD does little to recreate the suspense or the buildup to the ultimate crowning of Kelly Clarkson as the victor of the first American Idol. Performances are abbreviated and there is far too little commentary from the judges (who are just as much of the show as the contestants). One would hope that the AI2 DVD will be a compilation of ALL the episodes.
4,American Idol Mania hits our screens again!,"Relive all of the fantastic moments American Idol: Season 1 gave to us!! Relive Paula and Simons fights, all the BAD auditions and Kelly Clarkson's winning moment. With over 10 performances from the 10 finalists and 3 group performaces...this DVD is worth it!!"
1,boring,"I really didn't care much for the DVD, there needs to be more footage from the show. they only have about 40 minutes of show stuff from a show, that was 2-3 hours a week for over three months.but the bonus features make it worth buying, if you like American Idol.if you're looking for mostly footage from the show, don't buy it.it you're looking for lot's of interesting bonus stuff, buy it."
1,"Seriously, Who Would Buy This?","I honestly can't fathom who would be the market for a DVD like this. Couch potatoes who long for the glory years of ""Star Search?"" Or masochists who want to torture themselves even further by watching these tragically inept performances? ""American Idol"" is another nail in the coffin of pop music, endorsing the belief that it's not about how talented you are, but how cleverly you're marketed. Oh, I am begging you. Please do not get this DVD. Please. It looks atrocious."
5,Tough to find filter,"After buying a new house and realizing that our Carrier furnace needed a new filter, I wanted to be able to purchase the replacement filters without having to contact the furnace installers. This is the exact replacement, was shipped on time, was easy to install and works perfectly. Leave it to Amazon to be able to find anything!"
5,"""No Easy Answers""","Being the Parent of a L.D. (Learning Disabled)Child, I found the hardest part of the entire process to be finding a doctor who could accurately access my child's disability and then finding guidelines to help him grow to his fullest potential. My Early Childhood Development Doctor gave me ""No Easy Answers"". This book has been the ONLY one which accurately describes my son's problems and which precisely offers guidelines for his education and for living successfully with him. This is our bible on how to best communicate with our Son, how best to integrate him successfully into our family of six, and how to foster his strong points and nurture his weaknesses. I whole heartedly recommend this book for any parent struggling with a child with neurological difficulties. There is hope for our children. This book sheds some light into an otherwise overwhelming task. Good Reading!"
2,not an improvement,"I ordered this thinking it would be an upgrade over my stock shift knob either in appearance or feel. It is far smaller than I expected and feels insubstantial in my hand (and I don't have especially large hands). The feeling is more like holding the end of a broomstick than holding a shift knob that is ergonomically functional. Perhaps all of this falls under the category of subjective personal preference, but it would have been helpful if the seller had indicated the dimensions."
4,"Chinese Goldfish, by a Chinese expert!","I've had this book for many years in a German translation and even though the translation isn't always correct, the photographs and discussions alone opened my eyes to another world of goldfish! This book illustrates well that it is the Chinese who have created the original colours and forms of all known fancy goldfish on the market, barring perhaps the Tosakin, and illustrates very well the differences in taste in breeding between the Chinese and the rest of the world. Curled Gills, Dragon Pushing a Ball, Goose-Head Redcaps, etc., etc., this book (in my translation) aslo presents these Chinese fish with their original names; a wonderful book if you love goldfish!"
3,Make sure to get the right one!,"The product codes and images were a little weird when I got this so I had to make an exchange.. But they're nice bright sights in pretty much all light conditions and well encased in steel to protect them, and even have enough edge to do that fancy one handed slide rack technique. If they were backed up the the very rear of the slide(AS PICTURED) I'd be happier though."
5,Tritium Sights,These sights are easy to see even in total darkness. They were perfectly installed on my Kimber carry pro without a hitch.
3,TRUGLO TG131XT SIGHTS for Springfield XD-45ACP Tactical,"Well, they sure look pretty sitting in their package. I have not found a gunsmith or for that matter, a sight tool that will remove the original sights from the gun. Do not try to drift them out with hand tools, you will wreck the slide because they're in super-tight. Also, I saw an email on XD Talk forum stating that a gap between the barrel and the front sight is highly visible and that TRUGLO is working on it. I just emailed TRUGLO, no response yet."
1,Bait and switch-don't bother ordering,"This price is well below standard pricing. Upon ordering, you'll find they're ""out of stock"", but they'd love to sell you some standard tritium sights."
3,"Entertaining, but could have been so much more","This is an entertaining movie if you like the time period. Based on a true story of a prison camp that is run by women, where captured German soldiers are taken. It is fast paced, and this is where I think it let's the viewer down. The story could have been developed much more, and more slowly, such as John Malkovich's character. He just sort of breezes in and out, and you wonder why/how he always shows up at the times he does. Not at all like the really good WWII movies that we all know and love, but entertaining none the less. I would not buy the dvd, just rent it for $2.99. It's not a movie that you will likely watch more than once."
2,A Hard movie to watch.,"I was curious. Frankly, this movie is a WASTE of Your money. It ended up in my trash can after two watchings. I couldn't even donate to an area thrift store."
5,Love Them!,"I found that these sandals ran true to size, even for my wide feet. Other than the breaking-in period which seems to be required for all shoes, they've been extremely comfortable. I love the teal color - more greenish than blue, and so different from all the blacks, browns, and whites I already owned."
3,Clarks Too Big,"I love Clarks shoes, but these are not my favorite. They definitely are 1 whole size too big, had to send back and get a smaller size. In addition, the adjustment on the strap is only on one strap, not both. I am hoping the side softens where the strap connects to the shoe as it does rub my foot a little. The sole is very comfortable and the heel height perfect. Great with jeans or slacks."
1,A Gallon of Nothing,"I bought this gallon jug because the other Maxicrop Liquid Seaweed I had in the 32-35oz. bottle went real fast. Gone in a week after two waterings. And I noticed major new plant growth in that time. So I thought having a gallon of this stuff will help keep them going. Turns out this one only has the soluble potash and chlorine in it. It doesn't have the other most important stuff, like the nitrogen and phosphorus. I saw absolutely no new plant life. So I ended up dumping what I didn't use down the sink. The other review said this stuff is the missing ingredient to any garden, but it certainly has some ingredients missing from it. Now I think before you buy any Maxicrop Seaweed item, e-mail the seller and check to make sure the one they carry has all four major ingredients in it: nitrogen, phosphorus, soluble potash, and chlorine. Maybe add a little epsom salt for magnesium sulfate too for good measure."
4,well-acted period adventure,"Filmed for British cable in the early 90's, this was one in a series of four movies based on the romantic period novels of Dame Barbara Cartland. DUEL OF HEARTS is the story of Lady Caroline Faye (Alison Doody), who literally stumbles across the path of handsome Lord Vane Brecon (Benedict Taylor). Vane, who has been wrongfully accused of murder, hides a shameful family secret. Caroline, under the alias of Miss Fry, decides to enter the employ of his household in order to help him.A fascinating tale, filled with Cartland's always-enjoyable and potent mix of bodice-ripping romance and heart-pounding adventure. The cast also includes Michael York, Geraldine Chaplin, Virginia McKenna, Billie Whitelaw, Beryl Reid, Adalberto Maria Merli, Suzanna Hamilton and Margaret Mazzantini."
5,Makes me wanna PUURRRRR!!!!,"Hey this Action Toy is awesome!! Just keep the little pieces away from your pets and small children.The lady is perfect (well, not all cat people are Ladies-- where's the Cat Guy??? eh?) and the cats are their usual adorable selves.I like the witty sayings on the back of the blister pack too!!This is a keeper!! No one's gonna get to play with my set!!!LOL!!"
5,The laughter that will follow makes it well worth the price!,"I got this as a gag gift for my mother who is a hard core, crazed Cat Lady. The packaging on the reverse offers a quiz to determine if one is a ""Crazy Cat Person"". The laughter that will makes this gift well worth it for the laughs alone!I got this in Borders with a coupon which brought it down further. In this case, it's cheaper going into the retailer as you save on shipping.The reason I put 5 stars by the educational value is it's a wonderful learning tool in teaching children the importance in spaying/neutering animals! :)I also thought this would be a fun toy for my daughter to play with when she visits her nana.Can't wait to see the expression on my mother's face!"
4,"Good for laughs, if a bit impractical","I got this for my daughter, who is always threatening to become a Crazy Cat Lady when she moves out. It got a big laugh when she opened it, but it's been a week now and she still hasn't taken it out of the package. If you need a gag gift for a cat lover, this is a good one. Be warned, however, that the 'lady' is a bit creepy/scary looking in a Dawn of the Dead kind of way."
2,bad packaging,"My husband bought me this as a gag gift, and when it came the packaging was all open, so the pieces were loose. I wanted to leave it in the packaging, it's more of a collectible,funny kind of thing, and it looks cute in the packaging, so we glued it back together. I recently ordered another one, as a gag gift for a friend, and when I got it yesteday, it was the same thing, all open and apart, and I'm unable to get it back together. It's supposed to be a gift, so I'm going to give her mine, with the glued packaging instead of this mess. Really poor quality control, I think Amazon should do better"
3,Fun Christmas,"I bought this as a present for my sister who is on her way to becoming a crazy cat lady. When she opened it she called me a b*tch, but then laughed and smiled because she knows it is true."
3,Funny but limited,"My sister in law got a kick out of it, but it has limited entertainment value. It will probably end up in a drawer or the trash before long. It was good for a laugh, though."
4,Christmas,I love this item and so will my wife. The only problem was the the clear plastic holding the figure seperated from the cardboard.
1,What a waste of time and money.,"I purchased the landscape design software recommended on Victory Garden - what a waste of time and money (Staples will not refund software that has been opened). I tried several times to get past the first few basic steps of positioning the house on the lot and after hours of frustration I just gave up and removed the program from my computer. I didn't get anywhere near the ""design"" step. I use a computer 40+ hours a week at work, so I'm pretty savy, but this program is not user friendly. It focuses way too much on the 3-D glitter and not enough on useful and usable tools for the home landscaper."
2,Both thumbs down . . .,"The program has potential with a bit more refining, flexibility and power incorporated into it's structure. The plant database was a pleasant surprise though realize it would have to be much larger to accomodate all horticultural regions of the U.S. Basically, not a fully ""baked"" tool at this juncture unfortunately there are not many alternatives available."
3,Not what I expected,I was rather disappointed that this program could not import my house design from 3D Home Architect 4.0. The tools it has for designing the exterior of homes are very rudimentary at best.
2,"Against my better judgement, I bought this program","I read the reviews, but I was desperate for a landscaping program. You may be ok with a simple, rectangular lot. Most of the plants and trees that I have are not in the plant encylopedia. The program is not user-friendly."
1,Please read before you buy this product,After many hours of frustrating work I finally gave up on this product. I couldn't even find a way to draw a plot plan that wasn't a rectangle. My wife tried also and gave up. The manual is very sketchy and of little value. There are a limited number of objects to place in your design so you have to substitute token items for real structures. I highly recommend you do not buy this product. Look for something that has reasonable documentation and enough capability to describe something more than a rectangular patch.
1,This is a terrible program,... The graphics are extremely crude and inaccurate. You can't get a decent close up view of the garden.The plant encyclopedia does not work properly. You can't do a proper search and the filters do not work very well.I was very disappointed.
2,"Toy, not a tool","Not what you would expect, even for $$$. After many hours, I have a house model that still doesn't look like mine. You can't type in your house dimensions. Instead you have to rely on dragging the corners, a process which is way to coarse. The fence options look like something from Disneyland. They don't mention that amongst the 7000 plants, there are numerous varieties of carrots, melons, etc. Come on folks, that is just plain misleading. I have a 70 year old Douglas Fir tree in my front yard, which doesn't look like an overgrown Christmas tree, the only option offered by this program. There is no way to edit the models or introduce your own. Don't expect to do any serious work with this program. It is just a video game"
2,only okay,"Most of this sounds like it is old disco with the first disc being unmixed and the second (mostly the same songs as the first disc) all remixed. Some of the songs are very good, but there is not enough of those in the long run. Vocals tend to be average to very good, but not worth the price overall."
5,Excellent Reference Book,Great asset to our reference library.Very detailed ~ helpful while searching for specific informationregarding a specific subject.So glad to have access to this book.
2,ho hum outline...,"i read about an hour of this then stoped. an honest/sincere comentary but also bland, winded and dry. skip this one."
4,Almost loved it,"I really liked this movie.Can't say it was scary, but it did make me jump a few times. I wasn't too crazy about the ending but my friend liked it."
4,good bad and ugly,"this is what i want when i see a horror film!good-a good scary ghost story that actually scares its audience! don't get me wrong, it started slow but then the scares really pick up!bad-i wasn't a huge fan of the setting. the whole old times thing i just wasn't digging it. but that is a personal thing.ugly-although i thought the film was scary, it wasn't as scary as friends talked. according to them certain things stick with you and keep you from sleeping. this wasn't the case for me. i actually wanted to be afraid!final verdict: good-i do recommend this film. it will frighten you, yet at the same time its fun."
5,great old fashion gothic movie,"Very suspensful and yes, surprise ending. Daniel was great! The setting and mood was melancholy and spooky. Great story line."
2,A letdown,"I love suspense, I also enjoy scary movies this didn't have either for me. Maybe the next time. Thank you"
2,A VERY TEDIOUS AFFAIR,"After seeing the long running stage show I was looking forward to seeing the film version. What a huge disappointment it was. It was very slow moving and I was expecting some shocks in this ghost story. There were none. Beautifully photographed and acted. The mood was there but it was missing any scenes that should have make me jump in my seat. One thing puzzled me is that when the leading character decides to spend a very long day and night at the haunted mansion,all he takes is a little food that he is gven and (it appears) nothing to drink. You know there is no drinkable water in the deserted mansion. Also a dog is left to keep him company but no food or water is provided for the dog. There was nothing in this film at all that was original or scary."
1,Cheap Carnival Ride,"The ""thrills"" in this film feel like you're going through the horror tunnel at your local fair, which is to say lots of loud sounds and things jumping out at you for no good reason other than to make you jump. This is neither creepy nor scary; it's just annoying.The plot of The Woman in Black is pretty weak to begin with, and the film does nothing to add substance to Susan Hill's shallow tale in which the weather is the most interesting character of all. Radcliffe is unimpressive, and while he is good enough to portray the one-dimensional Harry Potter, as Arthur Kipps he simply goes around moping the entire movie, failing to make us believe in the supposed heartache he is experiencing.On the production side, the film is well made; The cinematography sets a good atmosphere, and the house is perfectly creepy as the main location for the plot. In the end, however, The Woman in Black is a poorly acted dull-fest plagued by incessant formula horror cliches."
1,Wont buy this,"This movie looks pretty awesome and I'd love to see it, but I won't buy another Ultraviolet movie. Ever. Find this review not helpful? Then you're not paying attention. Ultraviolet is a scam and that makes the item suck. Nuff said."
2,"So, so bad. Just...don't.","I spent half the movie looking for my nerve pills, and the other half wondering where Harry's glasses were. The plot was predictable, and the ending left me stupefied. Um, not in a good way."
3,not bad,its an okay horror film but i felt it still had a lot to be desired but definitly not bad you should rent it
2,Adults-Dont waste your time,"The only good review I have about this movie is that Daniel Radcliff was great in it. He nailed the character!! As for the movie itself, it was a disappointment. Too many ""scare tactics"" to appeal to a younger audience. If the movie would have stayed true to the book, it whould have been much better."
3,Woman In Black,I expected more. It was just ok. I am glad I saw it was a low key horror. Not something that kept you on the edge of your seat.
3,Good ghost story,"The movie was good as ghost stories go. Gets you jumping a little and gives you the creeps a little but for die hard scary movie fans maybe not so much. Story line is slow to become to clear, not a bad thing, but is still unclear. The solution seems to come to easy. As for Daniel he does a good job with facial expressions but dialog is thin and makes wonder if he could act in a speaking part. Overall it's OK but needed a little more meat on the bone."
2,Surprisingly... bad!,"I usually Love Daniel Radcliffe, and his movies are always very good, but this one was not on the ""Good List"". I was very disappointed with this movie. I tried to make good out of a bad situation, but for me, this was a miss. The movie had a few startling moments, but that was it. I found the story line interesting, but the movie was very boring in my taste."
3,Entertaining if not a little cheesy,"Watched this twice in one night, with two different sets of family members. Second time through it was easy to see plot holes. Untied, or shabbily tied ends.For me, the basis of WHY just wasn't strong enough. That said, I'd still recommend the show -- it's fun spooky, not gross or so creepy you have nightmares. I'm glad they still make movies like this, since I don't watch the extreme other horror flicks that stick to your bones."
3,Needed to move a little faster and an odd ending--No spoilers,"First off, I want to say that I enjoyed Daniel Radcliffe in this movie. I don't think anyone could have done a better job with the script he had to work with. I like watching serious movies, and he played this troubled character well, without overdoing it. However, the movie moves too slowly in the beginning and waits too long to provide some necessary explanations. Also, some of the special effects are too mechanical--cheap maybe?I didn't read the book, but the idea in this movie of what the woman in black is doing and why, and the way Radcliffe's character seeks to appease her made for a good story-line. While the ending could be called satisfying by some, I don't understand why the story ended that way."
4,Pretty creepy!,"Much better than I thought it would be. Not sure I can ever really see Daniel Radcliffe as anyone but Harry Potter, but I thought he was good in this film, and it was scary!"
3,Good old fashioned gothic ghost story...,"This flick is a good start for Daniel Radcliffes' post ""Harry Potter"" acting career. Though slow moving, we are treated to a forboding, foggy, English countryside atmospheric style photography throughout. Radcliffe plays his investigator roll low key and dosen't become bigger than the picture itself. A mothers' lament for the avoidable death of her son, takes its' toll on a small remote village, after her death. Be prepared for a few sudden shock sequences! This is thought provoking horror, with minimal blood and gore, akin to pictures made in the 1940's 50's and 60's. The CGI contibution is mainly for background, rather than creating overblown fantasy creatures. For an hour and a half Radcliffe must hold our attention. His fans and those who enjoy ghost stories should both be satisfied. The films ending packs an unexpected punch!"
4,Good thriller,Good thriller. We enjoyed it as a family and my wife had a blanket pulled up to her eyes at several points. Glad I didn't pay to see it at the movie but well worth the PPV cost.
4,"Good, scary movie","I spent a good deal of the time watching with my hands over my eyes. The scenes in the mansion were very creepy. I found Daniel Radcliffe to be a surprise as a grieving father, once I was able to get images of Harry Potter out of my head. It was a very mature choice following the completion of the Harry Potter series and he pulls it off rather well. It reminded me a little of The Ring. I don't want to say how and spoil the ending. Over all, a good, scary movie. This one will be on my list for Halloween movie night."
3,The Women in Black,"The movie basically followed the book, however there were some ommisions and changes but they did not alter the story line. Acting was good. Setting was great."
3,It's okay,"I enjoyed ""The Woman in Black,"" but not as much as I thought I would. It's a good ghost story/thriller, and Daniel Radcliffe delivers a strong performance in his first post-Harry Potter film. Visually, the film is impressive to watch, but I thought the pacing of the story was a bit odd throughout, and the end of the movie was unnecessary and super awful, to be quite honest. It kind of ruined the whole movie for me. This movie is worth watching, but I will never watch it again."
4,Solid ghost story,"Daniel Radcliffe readily engages his first post-Harry Potter lead role in this suitably spooky, nicely atmospheric ghost story. Those looking for a good story, rather than senseless gore, will be satisfied I think."
2,Not Impressed,"There's nothing I love more than a good horror story. This wasn't it. They rely on jump scare tactics rather than good story telling. The performances are good, and it looked good, but the plot is weak and predictable."
4,I liked this movie and I like Daniel Radcliff,"Daniel has improved greatly in his acting capabilities since his early start in The Tailor of Panama and then on to the Harry Potter role. I was anxious to see this movie and thought he did a nice job. The movie itself was ok altogether and I would recommend seeing it at least once. The scariest part of the movie, if you ask me, is the very ending when the Woman in Black looks right at you. I look forward to seeing more from Daniel."
3,Forgot the story,"I was disappointed in the end. The cast and acting was very good. The film looked wonderful. The buildup of music for suspense and thrills was cheesy and over-the-top. The story line was lame and in the end forgotten altogether. It is clean and I do wish there were more clean thrillers out. We need another good ""Poltergeist"", but alas..."
4,A good Dark Movie!,"This movie is good and has a very dark vibe to it. A man who can't get over his wife's death and whether or not if there is a heaven and she's there, you can't but feel sorry for him. You can feel and see his tourment and his loneliness. As you can see the acting in this movie is really good and it pulls you in. Even though the movie is good it isn't super scary. It does enough to keep you on the edge of your seat anticipating what is going to happen next. I really enjoyed this movie and believe that if you like movies with a dark, creepy, and gothic vibe to them you will like this movie also. Plus this movie does not use gore to try and scare you, its more sounds and shadows and brief encounters with the ghost. I give this movie a solid B."
2,A Let Down,"The movie has a okay story line, the creepy and haunting music gets your heart pumping and the woman in the black dress is a poorly animated scary person, they could have done better. The story line is weak and goes by fast. The movie got two stars instead of three because of the ending. The ending is stupid and weak. What kind of ending was that? Could there be a part 2? Who knows, this movie wasted my time and my money."
2,Cacophonous music does not a suspense movie make!,"An over-reliance on repetitive cacphony, loud and irritating, to create an atmosphere of suspense is a sure sign of a director who doesn't know how to create it otherwise."
1,Dull ghost story,"Only the very beginning got my attention, after that with the film's minimal dialogue, very sloooow pace, unsuspenseful direction, and the annoyingtime-consuming camera shots of Radcliffe's expressionless face. (See the photo of the DVD, that's the face he holds throughout the movie, except when he speaks) No scares, no suspense, no connection to characters. One of the most boring ghost movies I have ever spent time viewing (result=dozing off)."
2,Really?,"I gave it an extra star because you have to admit, the storyline and the ending is good. But the overall graphics and display reminded me of the TERRIBLE graphics in a cheap B rated horror movie where you get drunk and laugh at it with your friends. This movie had so much potential, but it was definitely a let down. I wish the director and producers made more of an effort of effects, props, and graphics; this is the 21st century. Usually, even with movies done to display such a time period, still has good effects, props, and graphics. Movie fans...don't waste your time."
5,Fantastic!,"As an avid Harry Potter fan, I decided I would watch this movie when I first heard he was doing it simply so I could support Daniel as an actor, life Post Potter. I figured it would be ok. It was fantastic. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. Radcliffe as Kipps is amazing and you really get to see Dan stretch his legs as an actor. I'll definitely be getting this when it comes out on dvd."
3,It was okay,I enjoyed the movie but not as much as I had hoped. Slow in many places and very dark to watch.
5,Classic Gothic Ghost Story,"Love the ""feel"" of the film, cinematography was spot on. Good story and nice to see Daniel Radcliffe play something other than Harry Potter."
3,Pretty good horror/thriller movie,"The Woman in Black is a pretty good movie. Better than a lot of other disappointing movies that have come out lately. There are actually some suspensful parts that may make you jump, which is rare in movies it nowadays. The plot and characters were pretty decent. What I really didn't like was the ending, but I won't spoil that for anyone. Overall it's decent, but not amazing or anything like that. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,Dead woman seaks revenge on the inoccent,"Dead ghost lady who lost her son seeks revenge on all the towns children, holding somekind of unseen power over the children she convinces them to kill themselves, and no one can stop this vengful ghost, so this story makes no sence to me, the background scenses are very nice, acting is desent, but thats it, has a bad ending that frustrates you, and the killing goes on, boo"
3,Lacking something,"This movie was OK, not great. The visuals were good, and the gothic feel was perfect for a ghost story......but it was slow and the ending was SO predictable that is was irritating. I knew how this was going to end halfway through. Daniel Radcliffe was good in this and has a great look about him for this type of story. Just wish there had been more substance to the movie and more of a twist here and there. There has been no good ghost story out there since The Others. And we need one!"
2,Predictable and Boring,"I really, really wanted to like this movie because it had Daniel Radcliffe in it. I like gothic horror stories and had high hopes. Alas, throughout the picture I predicted what was going to happen next with complete accuracy--it was that predictable. The ending stunk. This was a movie more in the same caliber as something you would see on Chiller or SyFy channel on television. Boring. Not worth time or money. Gave it two stars only because of Radcliffe."
3,Not a favorite,I was ready for a good case of suspense and even scary night. It was slow going and a bit predictable.
2,Just OK...,"Kind of slow moving. The story was very dragged out, to create effect, but it just made it boring. Not impressed."
1,A Silly Adaptation of a Really Scary Novel,"""The Woman in Black"" is a short (138 page) British novel written in 1982. It attempts to recreate the classic Gothic ghost story from the 1800's and it succeeds wonderfully -- this is a hella scary book, steeped in Gothic atmosphere and slowly but deliberately paced. Honestly, it will creep you out. But somehow, this movie f***s it all up, despite being an otherwise well made flick. I've read the book, twice, but even with that I couldn't follow the movie, as so much as been ""re-imagined."" And it's no longer a scary ghost story, just a muddled flick with some wanna-be scary graphics. Such a waste."
3,Average,"Reasonably well-executed but rather 'meh'. The 'big mystery' in the movie isn't. Some interesting, creepy effects but the movie as a whole can be pretty well summed up by 'meh' within the realm of ghost story movies."
3,was morbid,"it was ok, but really kindof messed up and not my cup of tea, and really weird cuz that is harry potter lol"
2,It's okay.,I'm glad I did not spend all the money to go see this at a theater. It was okay but I will not watch it again!
4,Entertaining,"Daniel Radcliffe does an admirable job in this new horror story from HAMMER Films. Slow and steady paced as a good haunted house story should be, it delivers the scares in a measured tone and pace. Much better than most of the recent ""scary"" gore fest style horror movies or stupid possession movies."
5,Good movie good picture,Love this movie I watched it 5 times very nice story watch it at nightDVD picture is excellent high resolution blue ray is very good quality and this movie in cloud with VudoI don't have to even watch it with DVD it's in cloud.
2,"Eh, very predictable",I would have loved it if it was the very first haunted house move I'd ever seen. But it wasn't. And so it was predictable and boring.
5,a classic horror,"I love this type of movie! A classic haunted house type of movie. Creepy enough to keep you a bit on edge, nice dark filming. Perfect for the month of October. Not just full of gore. Fun!"
3,Meh,"I really can't say much of anything about this movie. It's OK. Radcliffe is alright, the plot is passable, even the FX are just acceptible, but nothing about ""the Woman in Black"" will stay with me. Well, except maybe for how lame the ending is."
5,Solid ghost movie,"I have to say first that I LOVE movies about ghosts and hauntings and have seen as many as I could find. The fact that this movie is set in the early 1900s (I believe- don't quote me on that) gives it an old fashioned kind of spookiness that really added to the film. I thought the pop-out scares were decent but the storyline is what I thought made the movie superb. I'd recommend it to anyone, including those that shy away from horror movies, because it's unlike any I've seen- no gore, no dumb teenagers, no cheap scares, etc. Must-see."
1,Exceeded my limit for on-screen child murders,"I love horror movies, particularly supernatural horror movies, but I wish that a review would have warned me about the on-screen child murders. At about eight plus another tragic accident, this movie grossly exceeded my limit. It was even worse for my husband. Be warned."
1,It's really dull,"Daniel Radcliffe, a Hollywood pretty boy can't act his way out of a paper bag, and the flim is about as scary as an M. Night Shyamalan picture. While the camera work is subpar, it can't make up for the rest of the flim. I'm glad I rented this instead of bought it."
1,woman in black,I am very upset it said dvd and it is blue ray the main thing is the region is wrong so we cant watch it even on the ps3.
1,woman in black,this movie totally SUCKED big time...it's a waste of time and money. I couldn't stay awake to save my life.
1,Not worth your time,Beautifully filmed and well acted -- the entire cast works very hard to sell this story -- but you never feel connected to any of the characters and the story is ridiculously bad. Save your time and watch something -- anything -- else.
2,"Decent, but nothing particularly special","I rented this movie from Redbox because the trailer had looked interesting. The acting and premise of the movie were promising, but the story seemed underdeveloped. Daniel Radcliff ventures to a mysterious small town where the people seem to want to get rid of him as quickly as possible. We learn this is because of a local superstition that results in the death of the town's children. Sounds interesting enough, but the story tends to drag, and there isn't really anything to differentiate this movie from others in the genre. Throughout the movie we see similar sequences played over and over--a good portion of the movie is just Radcliff walking around a house.The story falls short and does nothing to invigorate an already stale genre. This movie is worth a rent at best, which is unfortunate because I was looking forward to seeing Radcliff in a new role."
2,"ehh, scares too cheesy","I usually like somewhat dark movies, but this was definitely not one of my favorites. The movie seemed to go for screaming in your face type scares instead of trying to be a deeper psychological thriller. It had the makings of a good movie, but the scares were too heavy handed and not thought provoking. This reminded me of going to a carnival haunted house. Not really my thing."
3,Dissapointment,"Great Build up ,but awful let down. I was expecting more than just a ghost story that ended with more ghosts. I just don't consider dad and son dying then being reunited with mom too happy. The Woman in Black just the titled made me so eager to watch and now I feel as if I wasted my time. I will give this 3 stars only because of ""Harry Potter"", is all grown up. LOL"
2,Slow,"I love horror movies, but this one didn't quite make the cut. Moved much to slow to keep me interested."
2,"Booooo,.... Shame on Hammer, this movie sux","I was so excited to see this movie I took some friends on opening night, it was a Hammer production after all, and the previews looked awesome. It was terrible, my friends still prod me for suggesting it. I'm a huge horror and Hammer fan and this movie is just long, boring, and hard to get through, it's one of those movies that strings you along for what seems like endless hours, you keep thinking somethings going to or got to happen at some point, it just never does. It's just not a good film. The atmosphere, costumes, period and look of the film are great, and I suspect people that gave it favorable ratings have never seen any good 50's, 60's or 70's gothic horror, or they are Danial Radcliffe fans, the acting, atmosphere and cinematography of this film are above average, but the film is just long boring and forgettable."
2,Not Impressed.,"I rented this movie because of Daniel Radcliffe. His acting is good. But something was lacking in this movie... Writing, story line, etc."
2,suffering from remakeitis,"Unless you have a teen age girl crazy about Daniel, you will be able to skip this. If you have to watch, have a good book, puzzles, knitting, or something else interesting to do while it plays."
3,I enjoyed it,Very scary without being gory or cheap. Daniel Radcliff did a great job and I can see he will have a career beyond Harry Potter
2,Harry Potter and the Haunted House,"I went to see this one with my wife's family thinking that it actually looked like a decent horror movie, I was terribly disappointed. They completely failed to develop or deliver any plot which is made all the worse by the fact that the book is actually decent. If they had stuck to that plot this could have been a good movie.*Spoiler*The entire movie is, he goes upstairs to see what that noise was, then back downstairs to continue reading papers. This repeats for an hour and a half. The end."
3,Curious,Was curious about this movie of Daniel Radcliff's after being known as Harry Potter for so long. He is a good actor and hope to see him in something a little more modern.
4,The Woman in Black,I thought it was a good movie that keep you on the edge of you seat. I was not sure about this movie at first but gave it a try and was surprised on how good it was.
4,If you love a good horror movie.,If you love horror movies like me then this is the one for you. The Woman in Black will keep you on the edge of your chair.
4,Decent,Suprised how decent this movie was a good thriller. Worth a watch if you like Suspense type movies Hammer Productions is always a safe bet
2,"""From ghoulies and ghosties and long legged beasties""","Lots of sluggish background noise. Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is sent on a mission to a foreign village (The Causeway to Osea Island, Maldon, Essex, England.) Never mind that it is the same scene from Dracula when they toss John Harker to the vamps. The screen writer was thinking more of the apocalypse now mission. He is to wrap-up the paperwork of a deceased client of the firm. Little did he know that he was going to suffer (along with us) a series of ""things that go bump in the night?"" and Lots of sluggish background noise. The native rabble at least did not carry torches and hunt him down. Soon he takes the threat personal.In association with Hammer Films, Who would have guessed?""Good Lord deliver us"" from this film"
2,"Book is much, much better","I read through many of the reviews until I found one I totally agrees with -Viewer (USA)- the movie does not really follow the book at all, but I sat through th show waiting for the ending, which to me made the book worh reading more than once. The true ending (book) is unsettling, unexpected and creepy as I imagine the author intended. This movie is a watered down version of the book. Now I remember why I don't go to see movies based on books I enjoyed; they are not up to the written word."
4,Harry Potter grows up,"I'll admit I watched this movie to see how Daniel would perform. He was very believable in character. The movie is your typical ""period"" supernatural thriller. I enjoyed it, as it was very well acted and the plot kept my attention."
4,FIRST REVIEW,This movie was surprisingly good. I was not sure how Daniel Radcliff would transition from Harry Potter to this role.
2,Visually Engaging -- but DULL DULL DULL,"I admit it. I only saw this movie due to curiosity about how Daniel Radcliffe would look as someone other than Harry Potter. He does well, but it almost seems familiar settings to have him in old buildings lit by candles.It's hard to say why this movie just does not entertain ........ it is visually rich - great sets, locations, wardrobe, etc ........ the actors all do well with their lines and all the characters are believable. BUT the movie just NEVER draws the viewer into it. All the ""scary parts"" rely on standard formulas - something moving in the background (that the hero never sees until it's too late) or something popping up suddenly (BOO!).It is just totally flat - one note - no depth at all. Maybe the book was more engaging - I hope so. The ending is disappointing and predictable.So, if you HAVE to see this movie - rent it. This is NOT worth buying."
4,Very Creepy!!!,"This movie was better than I was expecting. It had some very creepy moments and gave me chills. It has a very old skool gothic look. Daniel Radcliffe stars as Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer in charge handle the estate of Alice Drablow. After he arrives, eery things begin to happen and ghosts begin to appear. If you like gothic haunted house stories, you'll like THE WOMAN IN BLACK!!!"
2,Yawn,The movie was full of predictable situations. Daniel Radcliffe was a lifeless character encountering a mysterious ghost who's intention seems to be centered on the proper burial/reunion with her son. I gave it a two star only for the movie set location.
5,Finally an Unpredictable Thriller,"We loved this movie! It has been a very long time since we have seen a great scary movie. The story line keeps you guessing all the way till the end. And, on the edge of your seat. Daniel Radcliff was superb."
4,Daniel is kicking it up a notch!,"I watched the 2012 version of The Woman in Black after first watching the one from the 80's. In the 2012 film, the storyline is superb. It made sense, details and background were all covered and the ending couldn't have been better. This version of the film had more ghostly images throughout, doors opening and closing (why is that so terrifying?!) and a real sense of mystery. Daniel Radcliffe's performance was without a doubt admirable and after the first 10 minutes, I actually forgot about that whole Harry Potter thing...hehe."
2,Strange,Interesting movie not sure it is worth the time. A bit far fetched even for a ghost scary movie and in some places hard to follow
4,Creepy entertainment,"My daughters wanted to see this film because Daniel Radcliffe stars in it. But make no mistake. This character is no Harry Potter.However, this is an intriguing little scary film. The pieces come together nicely in a fairly predictable manner, though the ending offered an unexpected surprise."
4,A good flick,"I found that the ratings of this show were a little harsh. No there wasn't some amazing mind blowing twist at the end of this movie, but it didnt need it. It was a good well contained family friendly thriller.if you haven't seen it I suggest you should."
2,Good enough Movie but strange at the end,"Totally on unfinished ending, making the whole story a bit pointless, can't really ever know the back story since it is fiction."
3,Not scary or all that interesting.,"A young man travels to a small town set in the 1890's, where young children have been dying. He begins seeing images of a deceased woman and looks for a connection with the deaths. The movie contains certain predictable elements of the horror genre, like faces in the window, doors slamming, creepy music, and a rocking chair with no one in it. The late 1800's setting is effective, but this attempt at a combination of a horror film and a murder mystery falls a bit flat as the film is just not very frightening and the investigation into the deaths is only mildly interesting."
3,Where's a magic wand when you need one?,"The Woman in Black is a decent ghost story, but don't expect too much. A couple of loud noise jump scares. Harry Potter does prove that he can carry a film on his own. The atmosphere and set design are top notch, but the simple story is a been there done that. It is worthy of a rental, but check out The Changeling (1980) for some really creepy scares."
2,Story Sadly Lacking and Radcliff not convincing,"I wanted to like this movie, but.... I feel Radcliff was a poor choice for the grieving widower. He seemed unemotional and unafraid which did nothing for the character in the movie. I loved him in the Harry Potter/Lord of the Ring movies. I think he could be a good actor but not in this part. The flashbacks to the character's lost wife should have brought a tear or two to his eye but nothing but a blank stare each time. The scenery was gloomy, the house pretty scary, the idea of the waters covering the road gave the house a creepy air of isolation. The scared villagers were somewhat interesting but weren't enough to make it a good movie. I love a good horror mystery but this was not as scary as advertised."
2,i have no title,"oh my god! this movie taught me that in the end it's better to be dead then to watch ""the woman in black"""
2,Really really slow,"This was such a disappointment. On the upside, there were a couple of good scares, but you sure had to wait for them, and the costuming, location and sets were spectacular and absolutely appropriate for the era. Otherwise is was really long and dull. Way too many gloomy stares and pregnant pauses. I was expecting something with a bit more pizzaz and excitement, but there was none."
4,Good not great.,Cast performed quite well. It was true to the period and creepy enough to make my palms sweat. It didn't seem as predictable as most scary movies.
4,A frightfuly good ghost story,"I'm not sure if Daniel Radcliffe was the best actor for this, but the story was very good. it was very atmospheric and spooky, it would be great for a rainy October night."
3,Decent Breakaway from Harry Potter,"This poor boy will probably never fully breakaway from Harry Potter even though he's done fabulous theatre work. This movie had a decent story line, and was well acted by Radcliffe. However, this movie is filled with jump scares. It was a slow film, but I kept watching in hopes of getting a good ending. I think the ending was unexpected. Overall, I would rate this as a ""Red-box Night"" film and not a film to add to your collection unless you're a Radcliffe fan."
3,"Decent thriller, yet another letdown to the horror genre","I think many reviewers were a little to generous with this film. I give it three stars meaning it was adequate, a five out of ten. Would I buy it, no, should you pay to watch it, no. This movie has a few jumpy moments, but gets rather dull as the plot goes on. The cinematography, as with so many films this days, is very professional and the setting is very dreary, reminding me much of Jane Eyre. So, yes stylistically this film is cool and it was entertaining; however, the characters and the precarious plot ruined it for me. The characters are rather dull, and flat, and I found it hard to attach myself to their emotions, or care about their fate. The plot was also a letdown. The ending seemed contrived, like the writers couldn't think of an ending so they followed the typical suit of love or death, and a lot was left unexplained. So there you go, unfortunately a big budget doesn't seem to help screen writers pull their stories together nicely."
4,"Fantastic, exciting read! (& I hate Romance!)","I really enjoyed this book, Taylor is independent, smart, witty and that is a relief in the world of romance. Niether she or any of the other charachters are simpering, ignorant cliches.I liked O'Donnell's 'The Angel and the Prince' immensley, and this book was even better! I hope to pick up more from this writer soon- Please keep up the phenomenal work Ms. O'Donnell!"
1,"hate it, if was not clean","very sad with this book, it was't clean. I will add her to my black list. its too bad she can't write good clean books"
1,Unrealistic ending,The book was a page turner to start but I was so disappointed by the ending that it really made me dislike the book. Don't waste your time with this one and read something else.
5,"Excellent Read: Entertaining, Informative & Thought Provoking","Well Done! I am not one that usually read thrillers but this book grabbed and held my attention. Truth and fiction are so well interwined in the story that it is hard to discern which is which. Read this book for the entertainment value, read it for information on how porous and vulnerable our economic system is to abuse, and read it to raise your awareness about the world. Read it.Congratulations Julie & Kenin, you deserve much success."
1,Terrible! Simply Terrible!,"I gave this book one star simply for the basic plot of using pharmaceuticals as weapons of terror. There are so many characters written into the book, the story becomes convoluted. The authors also feel they have to explain ever little detail of every minor character. Boring... All the major characters are very one dimensional: rich, spoiled, power hungry, hardly a redeeming trait among any of them. It's hard to believe it actually took two authors to do this much damage to a storyline. This book cried for an editor to tear into it."
2,Not one of his better books,"This book is loaded with statistics, involves some interesting ideas, and is written by an author with a strong institutional background. Unfortunately, it is very weak on content. The rewards from plodding through the often unnecessary information are minimal. Fieldhouse tries to protect himself in the introduction by saying that such phrases as the 'West' and 'Third World' are not accurate. This is true, but he writes as if he can use them anyways. He writes a chapter on East Asia after having admitted to not know anything about it. His conclusion states, basically, that the countries that did well all had good governments. No kidding. An experienced scholar might find some interesting arguments in this, but authors such as P. McMichael make this book look to be, well, openly incorrect. It may provide a good contrast that sparks discussion on the topic, but this book should not be read as a text."
1,Tempo gone crazy,"If this is the same Weissenberg version of the Italian Concerto I heard on the radio the other day, I must say it is an unconscionable performance. Weissenberg is a highly respected pianist in many genres. What got into him here, I don't know. The beauties of Bach can only be appreciated by a listener to this performance if he knows the piece well and can complement what he actually hears with what he remembers from past hearings. I heard mostly the third movement. To say ""I heard it"" is an exaggeration; I noticed it, whoosh, racing past me. Someone who hears this for the first time will not realize what this composition contains. He will, however, appreciate having gotten through it quickly."
4,fine product,"This product does keep your eyes lubricant, but I prefer too uses a liquid form of this product."
3,The media war,"This book is devtoed entirley to the media during the Gulf war and propoganda operations.It is one of the best books for people working in the media industry.There is a little ""thories"" here, and therin lies the great virtue of the work ."
1,Piece of junk...,"Having to read this book as part of a club for discussion is the only reason I would even spend my time for reading this piece of rubbish. The author is obviously putting his own political leftist views into his view of the war. The author simply spews out outrageous claims with no factual data to back it up. I, being a centrist and not left/right leaning, found this book to be a biased attempt by a leftwing author to denegrate the accomplishments of the US in their attempts to solve problems in this complex world. Based on the authors views the US is responsible for the world's problems. Total BS coming from a guy who probably benefits from the global policies of the country he denounces so readily. The most amazing part of the book is that if he really believes the crap he writes he should get the heck out of here and move to an eastern block or middle eastern country."

4,Good Stuffs.,"Katelyn's got a natural gift to address the young teen generation with her music. Of course, it would be cliche to compare her to Hillary Duff, but Katelyn is a growing Disney girl, like it or not. I had the opportunity to accompany her on piano at a pageant recently, and she's every bit as energetic in person as she is on her album. Definitely a career to be watching, and a CD to be playing."
5,Awesome CD!,"I ordered Katelyn's CD online because I am always interested in up and coming artists. When I received it, I was pleased to finally hear all of the songs on the CD. The CD has a variety of songs, but my favorite would have to ""Wonderful Crazy."" Yet, each song has its own appeal to me, which makes the CD very much enjoyable.With such a variety on Katelyn's CD, it will appeal to such a wide audience. Katelyn is definitely an excellent artist and I cannot wait to hear more from her in the future!"
5,Wonderful Crazy is Crazy Wonderful!,"This album is, by far, the best album that I have heard in a very long time. Each song is very well written and Katelyn's vocals are right on the money. The album is chocked full of songs which are not only fun, but inspirational as well. Wonderful Crazy is an outstanding first effort from Katelyn Tarver and just the beginning for this wonderfully talented entertainer."
2,Her voice is a bit weak,"I wonder if the other reviewers listened to the same album as I did. The songs ""Wonderful Crazy"" and ""Rain"" are okay, but overall I could not get past how weak and pitchy her voice is. She could improve, but I was not impressed. I love pop music like this, but perhaps you should check out the first Hilary Duff album, Metamorphosis.....or even Jordan Pruitt.Just my two cents."
1,all the songs sound alike,"Although, hopefully this artist will grow, all of these songs sound exactly like the last. These songs will perhaps appeal to the 14 and younger girl crowd. But looses when it comes to the average teen and definitely no adults permitted here. She's young so she has time to mature, but should probably spend a few years on the Disney channel raising fans like Hillary did."
1,Review by a Philippine Corrs Fan,"Please do not be deceived by the title of this item, for it is not at all labelled as the GREATEST HITS, nor is it a box set. It is just an ordinary version of the 18-track Corrs cd album THE BEST OF THE CORRS. If you should not have this item yet, then I strongly discourage you from purchasing this particular item. Instead, I would recommend to you the preceding item[ i.e. THE BEST OF( EXTRA TRACKS ) ], which is both cheaper than this item and has more to offer with the additional track ""Lifting Me"". There also exists another cd album THE BEST OF THE CORRS( EXTRA TRACKS ), but it has the track ""Una Noche""( Spanish-language version of ""One Night"" sung as a duet between Alessandro Sanz and Andrea Corr ) instead of ""Lifting Me"". I would recommend that version as well."
5,Maggie Shayne,All of Shayne's books are a must have in my Library. I can hardly wait for her next book to release!
5,COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN,"This was just an incredible read! I couldn't put it down. The suspense kept me turning the pages. I could taste the fear of the characters. Sean is hot and the cult leader is the creepiest. And I just LOVED the witty banter between Julie and Sean. FABULOUS BOOK! JUST FABULOUS! Hope a sequel featuring Lizzie will be coming soon. Maggie Shayne is equally talented in everything she writes: vampires, suspense and category."
3,Motorcycle Pan,"The pan was ok, However the motorcycle was not very clear once it was baked. I think I might stick to alumnium pans"
5,lots of detail,"Bought this mold to make a stepping stone-all the detail that is with-in this mold is almost unreal! it made a very cute stone! made a few more for friends-but the cement is so heavy-so after pouring a few more the 'plastic' started to crack around the inside bottom edges, I'm not complaining I knew this could possible happen in this light weight cake mold-just happy to have got as many stepping stones as I did-never did try it for a cake! would buy another for food purposes if needed- Thanks again CK products"
2,no directions,Description on Amazon website states that complete directions included. I received the pan without any directions. I am hoping I can figure out how to do this.
3,"Good collection, good price.","This collection is well-offered. However there are a few things you should be wont to know:First off, the pages are scripture-thin. I prefer a heavier page.More importantly, the editor often mixes the right and left hand cleffs. what I mean is, the editor places the right hand and left hand on the same cleff when it is convenient for him. I however, find this more difficult to sight read because you can't tell where one hand's chord ends and the others begins. It's like the laziest kind of writing.Also the printing is not perfectly sharp (but it is acceptable).So there are probably better (clearer) editions if that's what you're looking for. I would buy this again for its price, however."
3,Not the Paderewski Edition,"I'm currently studying this piece, and bought this item, which looked just like my teacher's, only it's edited by Carl Mikuli instead of Paderewski. (both have the perry winkle front cover). There are significant changes in dynamics and articulation. I spent one week marking it up, only to find that my teacher is making me buy the other one - the Paderewski, and that edition's pages are thicker, darker, and less crammed onto the pages. We compared the two editions and it is a big difference. The Paderewski is more recognized and favored as being better."
5,Perfect problem solver,"I have had an aftermarket stereo deck in my vehicle for many years now, and wanted to have a mini-jack plug-in without installing a new deck. This item is exactly what I needed. It has a self-stick back and also can be screwed in to a surface. I have it mounted underneath the dash in the center. It is unobtrusive and the cable attached to it is not too long, and not too short. My aftermarket stereo had an unused input on the back, and this plugged right up to it. The mini-jack is secure and holds a 1/8"" plug tightly."
5,Perfect for adding an Aux Input to your vehicle,"I just installed a Blitzsafe aux input in my Honda Ridgeline and used the IP35. It works absolutely perfect and looks professional.I did something similar on my Honda Pilot, but used some Radio Shack parts to cobble together a recessed plug. That was more effort and the finished product wasn't as clean looking.Buy it -- It is a bargain and you'll be happy with it."
2,Good quality sound with poor durability,"This unit has great sound for buck but I find the overall quality to be a bit flimsy. The earbud covers (foamy things) comes off way too easily and are a major drag. Mine broke after just a little over than 90 days. Bass is good, and soundroom is decent - but no way these will stack up with a pair of decent closed over the head phones. I find that during exercise that a headband i required, but that is as much a question of how you position your player. Recommended for sound and good if your commuting - if you need these for any kind of exercise - Stay away. Also you may go through 3 of these in a year. they are not very durable"
3,Needs better editors,"A very hard book to read, primarily due to the way the text was edited. While the grammer may be correct, the way it was edited / translated makes it a chore to read. Also a good part of the book was devoted to the isreali use of the Mirage III series during the arab - isreali wars rather than development of the mirage from III to 2000. Arab - isreali air wars are better covered by other books, as such this book does not add much new information.If not for the extensive photos this would not have been worth the price."
3,The title story is great.,"It's been a while since I read this, so I'm not sure which stories are in this one, but the story ""Can You Feel Anything When I Do This?"" is amazing. On the face, it's absurd, but when the robot said, ""How can anything feel and anything not feel?"" it got to me. Yes, I'm insane, but I think perhaps the trees have their lusts and the streets have their passions...."
5,Testimony of Light.,"Have heard about this book for years. Finally purchased it. Find it very interesting. And it does make you pay more attention to how you actually live your life, and what your true motives are for your actions. Quite uplifting."
4,Helped me when my mother died,"My mother died suddenly in March 2012 and a friend recommended this book to me. I found it to be a great comfort even though my spiritual beliefs are not exactly those of the author. I felt like she wrote in a way that made sense to her and her spiritual beliefs; however, I was still able to get comfort without stumbling on any differences between us. I found the other reviews of this book here on Amazon to be helpful and informative as to the content. I will be reading this book again and again."
5,Testimony of Light,An amazing reveal of what waits for us told by 2 Sisters whose deep faith and friendship opens them to this spiritual communication
4,Testimony of Light,Great insight into the afterlife. Not only heaven but also hell as depicted in the Astral World (place souls go after dropping the human body).
2,An Unusual Read,"This is indeed a very unusual read. Without giving anything away, one should be aware that it presents a controversial position on life-after-death issues. It does touch on some ideas that just now are beginning to gain more understanding and acceptance in today's world."
1,FUNDAMENTAL CHRISTIAN SPAMMING AT ITS WORST,"I bought this book on Amazon after seeing it being recommended over other books on Amazon. After I read this book I was a bit shocked as it is poorly written, terrible grammatical skills, and I learnt nothing from it. It reeks of DOGMA. It was then I realized the reason I have seen this book being recommended on other New Age books is that this is a form of FUNDAMENTAL CHRISTIAN SPAMMING at it's worst.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BOOK TO ENLIGHTEN YOU DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. AS IT IS FULL OF FUNDAMENTAL BASIC BURN IN HELL FOREVER MORE DOGMA."
2,Testimony of Light: An Extraordinary Message of Life After Death,All I can say is the book content was not what I had hoped for.
2,stollic,I didn't care for the reflections that were given by the ladies in this book. It was hard to understand what she was saying. I think she was stuck in some realm..
2,Some people believe anything!,"I am interested in Angels so I tried this one. It's an interesting read, but I thought it was pretty obviously pushing one viewpoint on the reader. While it's not that new age hooey, there's no research because it's all in her own mind. She might as well be writing about an interesting dream she had.As far as I'm concerned this is some fairy tale they're telling to get you to be good little boys and girls. I was sorry I got it."
4,SO HEAVENLY MINDED,"A VERY SMALL BOOK, WITH AN ETERNAL MESSAGE ABOUT A LADY WHO STEPS INTO THE NEXT WORLD. WHAT SHE FINDS, WHAT SHE FEELS ABOUT WHAT SHE FINDS. THE MORE SHE FINDS, SHE EXPLAINS IN NEW TERMS THAT EXPLAINS HER NEW KNOWLEDGE. OVER TIME SHE CHANGES, BECAUSE OF WHAT NEW INFORMATION HAPPENS TO HER THINKING.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL WHO SEEK THOUGHTFUL EXPLANATIONS OF NEW CONCEPTS OF LOVE, LIFE AND GOD."
1,3 MONTHS LATER LOOKING TO BUY A REPLACEMENT,"...this camera eats batteries like nothing else I've ever experienced. Cant think of anything in its favor.. its bulky and ugly.. and I feel embarrassed asking someone to take a picture for me, because it's difficult to use and very tempermental! Just arrived back from Chicago where I took 25 pictures.. and had to buy 4 new batteries along the way.. already searching online for a good replacement"
3,Russia's War by Overy can be a better option,"It is a quite fairly good book. But much more focused on the military details, which can give you overwhelming names of units in some parts of the narrative, but lacking the maps for better understanding of the manouvers. If you are looking for a broader perspective and more general details, e. g., what happened in Leningrad and Stalingrad during the sieges or some links with what was happening in Germany's west front, I'd recommend Russia's War by Richard Overy instead."
4,Needs a lot more maps,An excellent book = except it needs a lot more maps. Specifically those for the local/regionalactions described in the text. Perhaps this could have been done (or still can be done)in a companion volume. This would allow for the inclusion of more place names as well.
2,Not what I hoped for,"I'm not sure who this book would really appeal to. It seems too brief and compact to appeal to scholars or military history buffs. The text is utterly lifeless, so it wouldn't appeal to fans of narrative history. I know it has great virtue in the fact that it examines the conflict from almost exclusively the Soviet point of view, but I'm amazed that such a dramatic story as this could have such a boring presentation."
2,"Dense, dense, denser","Colonel Glantz's reputation preceded him, and so I bought this book, expecting a major work describing the war on the Eastern Front. Coming in at about 300 pages, archival it isn't. However, it is written in the deadest prose I have encountered in a long time, with endless shopping lists of manouvres, and very little of the big picture. Detail is great, but repetitiveness of this degree is excruciating. Too many facts maketh Jack a bad story teller, and surely, the art of writing well is to sift out useful facts from trivial ones. I can make as good a claim as anyone to being being spellbound by the Russian front, but this book reads like a not very original Master's thesis. 62% for the thesis, and 45% for daring to publish in the general domain. Money back time, I'm afraid. This book has gone in pristine condition to the nearest charity. A terrible disappointment."
3,A disappointing tactical review,"This book presents a lot of tactical detail. E.g., Unit A was reorganized and attacked the left flank of Unit B in the early morning of XYZ. It works neither on the human nor the strategic levels. Moreover, the authors seem rather approving of Stalin. E.g., they switch back and forth from calling ""Dictator"" and ""Premier"". The latter seems a stretch in anyone's lexicon."
3,Ok but not great.,I was looking for something like David Irving's Seminal work Hitler's war but from Stalins perspective.This book does give some good info from the Soviet perspective but does'nt answer many key questions.How Did the Soviets go from a broken country in 1918 to having a state of the Art defense industry by 1942. Did Stalin have an inkling of Hitler when he started the massive industrialization from 1928 on. How was a communist system which despised open thinking and free thought yet still be able to industrialize and design stuff like the T-34.In tactical terms Glantz does not explain the soviets defense system from 1943 on where the Soviets had some 25+ bridgeheads and could not be ejected from a single bridgehead. Whereas against the west the Nazi's almost broke their back in the Battle of the Bulge. What was the soviet techniques such that Nazi armored counterstrokes against infantry held bridgeheads were unsucessful.
1,Too Incomplete,"The #1 reason Germany lost that front was due to one simple reason : 4 of the top ten German officers had become traitors and gave the Soviets all the german iformation. ""Lucy"" and ""Werther"" (code names for the two top informants) began to give Stalin any and all information ( probably due to moral reasons, as the army never approved of Hitler's radical policies). ""Lucy"" was a top german general and ""Werther"" was either Jodl, Bormann or Keitel...we will probably never know which of the 3 men Werther was, as Russia keeps its secrets locked. In fact, after the war, Zhukov admits Stalin asked for a surrender in late 1941, but the message never got to Hitler. Stalin did get a reply from a german officer, and from that, Stalin decided not to surrender, not to flee Moscow , and instead- fight the end. Zhukov did not know what that reply was, but it is at the same time Stalin began getting his German informants to tell all. This is what happened, and why Germany lost the Eastern front."
3,Only applies to one state!,This book was overall informative. Since there are so few books about process serving I recommend everyone read it but I was disappointed to find that the book is very specifically about process serving in Missouri. Nothing in the description mentioned this. I could have invested my money in something more appropriate for me. Its a good book but I'm giving 3 stars because it was not clear that it only applies to MO residents. Good overall for some general background though.
1,Process Serving Review,This book was basically worthless. The information was out of date and not very helpful at all. I had to get another book from an author who knew what they were talking about.
3,Not Very Useful...,...unless you live in Missouri. Much of the (limited) information in this guide is rather specific to the rules of civil procedure in the author's home state only.Do NOT get started in the field of process serving based solely on this book; much of the information given is incorrect and/or incomplete depending on where you live.Three stars for the meager techniques/tips that a pure novice may find useful.
1,leaky,"Very bad! It's leaking all the time especially while you walking! It's impossible to put it in a backpack unless everything will be wet. If its cost 25$, It should be good quality!"
2,too tall,The cup functions fine but is too tall to fit in the dishwasher and tends to tip in the car-the 14 oz works better
2,One problem,"Good thermos, however it is not spill proof. If you turn it upside down, even with the lid shut, it will drip. Thats kind of a big deal to me. Other than that its does what it is suppose to do, but i repeat, IT SPILLS!"
2,Not tightly sealed,Contains many coffee but at falling all on a thing pours out... I do not recommend!I wish to return.
5,"Thermos, Nissan 18 oz travel cup","Traded up.Went from the 14 oz to the larger size. Very satisfactory. Fill once in the AM, last all day, still hot (warm) at 1700 hrs. Has survived at least one fall from the back of my pickup. Some dummies forget it is on the tailgate. This number four, last one was donated to a rental car company. I keep coming back for the same thing.Dick Carroll"
2,A bit over-rated,I bought 4 of these on the buy 3 get one free promo.The cups retain heat well for 4-6 hours which is nice as I can take two 16 ounce cups of coffee on the road.The bad things are the flip lid retains coffee which ends up on your nose -- very annoying. Also as others have indicated the travel mugs are NOT sealed so if they tilt they will spill when closed.I also had an issue where one of my travel cups has a very small leak at the bottom seal.Another disadvantage is that they do not fit under my Keurig machine (my fault for not measuring (the joys of buying online and assuming it is going to fit without measuring). So I have to tilt these to fill them which you have to be very careful not to spill this way by leaning against the machine unattended while filling.Overall these are OK mugs... I would not spend $20 each on these again given the flaws and not up to normal Thermos quality standards IMHO.
5,Great Mug,"The Thermos Nissan travel mug definitely holds in heat better than any mug I've had to date. Note that the top doesn't seal completely, so you will get some spillage. However, it keeps my coffee/tea good and hot for about 3-4 hours. We'll see about the durability of the flip top. So far so good."
4,"Great for keeping drinks hot, but leaks if tipped over.","I like this mug a lot, have been using it for well over a year now and it looks and functions like the day I bought it. The only downside is that if it tips over, like if I have it in the car and take a corner too hard, is that it spills all over the place. The little flip down stopper really only works as a splash guard if you walk with your mug, but doesn't stop any liquid from coming out if it's on its side."
5,Observation,"I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR AN INSULATEDE TRAVEL TUMBLER FOR YEARS. ONE THAT STAYS COLD OR HOT AS REQUIRED.SEARCH IS OVER, THIS IS THE ANSWER. tHANK YOU AMAZON AND THERMOS."
2,Nissan thermo--no fit top,"This would be a great thermos if the top fit correctly. As it is, the top won't go on tight...allowing a slight drip. It slips as you try to tighten it down. Not a good thing when you've got hot coffee in it. Too bad."
5,Finally...something that keeps coffee HOT!,"I have been in search for the ""perfect"" travel mug. I have tried so many and I always run into the same problem - after about an hour or less, my coffee would be lukewarm. This travel mug keeps coffee HOT for hours - honest! Don't know if it is leak-proof .. I don't make a habit of putting my travel mugs upside down in a bag. All that I cared about is that it keeps my coffee HOT, and it certainly does!!"
2,Cheap,"This mug is not well designed and the construction is shoddy. I have three thermal mugs and this one is not going to get any use. It's just as well, it was the lowest cost. The lid does not seal, you can't fit your hand in to wash it, coffee pours into/accross the lid for consumption, and I don't like the lack of a handle. Given that it is not leak proof, the lid is way oversized. The little hole stopper is just a nuisance."
2,Leaks,"I have other Nissan products, but this one is just a poor design. If you tip over the tumbler with the lid closed, the beverage just pours out. The liquid leaks out of the pivot holes for the drink stopper. The lid needs to go back to the design center."
2,The 14 ounce version is BETTER!,"They dont tell ya it's leak-proof. Good thing too, because it's not!This thing leaks like crazy from the ""flip-top"" sip latch. The lid is also not insulated (like the 14OZ version).With the aid of a little epoxy, I made the tumbler totally leak proof. However; this defeated the flip-top, and turned it into a regular thermos.If you know your never going to lay this thing on it's side, or slosh it around, no worries. Just dont expect to toss it in your back-pack or briefcase full of your favorite beverage (like you can with the 14OZ version) without getting soaked!"
5,Can't beat it!,"I had a thermal mug I used for years, but it did not fit into the cup holders of a CR-V. I purchased this mug and it is perfect. It keeps the coffee hot all morning and it is easy to travel with. Plus, because there are no handles on the mug, I can fit it in other water bottle holders (on my back pack, for example) when not filled. The clipping device prevents splashes from leaking, but would not contain the coffee if you flipped a full mug upside down, etc. Highly recommended!"
5,Coffee Stays Hot!!,"Every morning I leave for work before my husband. Being the wonderful wife that I am, I leave him a cup of coffee in the bathroom for when he wakes up. However, by the time he gets up to have his coffee, it would be almost cold (the travel mugs we were using were not keeping the coffee hot). Now, however, he enjoys a steaming hot cup of coffee (no matter what time he gets up) because of the Nissan 18-Ounce Stainless-Steel Insulated Travel Tumbler!! THANK YOU!!"
2,Disappointed,"I currently own and use several Nissan products. I have found their thermos to be the best by far. The travel tumbler has a hinged flap on top that is not air tight and the liquid drips out when closed. Not very travel worthy in my opinion. I returned it. Look for the words ""leak proof"""
2,I expected more,"First of all, the odd shape prevents it from being used in my cup holders in my car (Honda Civic). It's too skinny and too tall. Secondly, it's not spill proof. I'm not even certain that it's spill resistant. If it tips over you're going to get liquid everywhere.That being said, it does keep my coffee hot. It's just such an impractical design that I wish I had something else. I've searched and can't find any 18-20oz cups that keep coffee as hot that are also spill proof."
4,"Great insulation, minor design flaw","This is a great travel mug, it keeps my coffee hot for 4 hours if I don't have a chance to drink it. Unfortunately, there is a design flaw with the lid - every time I flip up the stopper on the lid and tip my cup towards me so that I can drink, the stopper predictably puts 1 drop of coffee on the bridge of my nose. My solution has been to just keep the stopper up so that it doesn't have a chance to drip coffee on me."
1,LEAKS,"We bought this as a gift from my daughter to her grandfather for Christmas. It LEAKS. I was concerned because of the reviews but it is the only 18 ounce I found and my husband thought this was the best size. Read the reviews(ratings1,2) and beware...."
2,It leaks and how.,"If you don't actually need to travel with this tumbler, it'd be great. It holds a lot of coffee and it keeps it warm for hours. No debate. But it leaks and not just a drop or two, but as if it were open."
4,Love it.,"I got this for Christmas (I'd put it on my wishlist), and I use it every single day. The average temperature where I live for the past month or so has been about 24 degrees, but even on long car trips, my drink stays warm for hours. I've stopped pouring my really hot drinks into it if I'm not traveling because it keeps them so hot for so long that I can't even drink anything for a while. Great investment."
3,Keeps it HOT but......,"This is an incredible product for keeping your beverage hot or cold. It amazes me how well it works as many others have commented BUT I think it has a serious design flaw also as mentioned by others. There is a rubber gasket on the inside of the cup and whatever you are drinking gets trapped under it and really cannot get out without VIGOROUS washing. I run this through the dishwasher after every use because of this. It's really a great product but every other insulated mug I have doesn't have that gasket (yuk) problem. I suspect all the great reviews haven't discovered this as it took me a while until I noticed the odd smell inside the cup. Lifted the gasket and ""old"" coffee (latte) came out and was pretty gross. If it weren't for the gasket problem I would rate it a 5-star but having to wash it really well after each use causes me to leave it sit on the shelf and I grab my old one instead... too bad really."
1,Unsanitary,"Never have I been steered so far wrong by Amazon reviews -- I cannot believe people actually like this thing. Read the one star reviews: THE SEAL AT THE TOP OF THIS CUP LEAKS. What ever you are drinking will ooze into the cavity between the thermal layer and the outer shell. It will grow rancid and fester, and then it will ooze back out into whatever you are drinking weeks or months later.Seriously needs to be taken off the market."
4,wonderful travel mug,The Nissan travel mug is very nice and it keeps items cold and warm for quite a while. The only complaint I have is that it is not 100% leak proof if it is not in the upright position. A good buy.
1,This Cup Leaks!,"I purchased this cup for my spouse, and needless to say it was a big mistake. The cup leaks. My spouse is an inspector which means he travels a great deal in the city. The cup is supposed to be spill-proof; it is not. The cup leaked when he came to an abrupt stop, spilling the hot content all over the seat, floor etc. I thought he was exaggerating, so I filled the cup with cold water, turned it upside over the sink, and well it leaked. I would NOT recommend this cup. I only wish I would have read the other buyers comments before purchasing this cup."
1,leaks and doesn't stay hot,"I was disappointed to find that this insulated tumbler does not stay hot beyond 20 minutes, even when I set it in an insulated zippered cover. Not worth the $ or bother to purchase."
3,Good thermos but it leaks badly,"Like every Nissan vaccum flask product I ever bought, this cup does a good job of keeping my hot stuff (coffee in this) hot, especially if you follow their advice and pre-heat the inside with hot water.This particular design has a major flaw in the lid though. The sip-closure does not seal. It leaks quite a lot and quite easily. As in, I cannot turn the cup on its side and not have fluid pour out. That is a very bad thing in a travel mug. If you only use this as a desk cup then maybe it won't bother you. It still bothers me. When I carry it around at work I have to keep it upright.I have to imagine that the heat retention would also be better if it had a more-insulated and sealed lid design, not that heat retention is awful now (it is indeed worse than my larger Nissan thermos-style flask)."
1,Not leakproof,"Keeps liquids hot (as most travel mugs will do), but this leaks/spills to the point I would not purchase this item. If this tilts a bit, or falls over, you will lose most, or all, of what's in the mug. It's as if there is no cover on it at all. I will unfortunately be looking to purchase a new and different travel mug."
3,"Insulates well, but leaks!","I would give this thermos 5 stars for insulation, quality materials, and ease of use (no annoying screw-on lid). Unfortunately, if you knock it over, it WILL leak. Be careful with hot liquids!"
3,It'll do,"My husband needs a large travel mug for his morning smoothie. This one isn't large enough, as it turns out. Also, like almost any insulated item, it shouldn't be run through the dishwasher - I didn't realize that before I bought it. At $25, it's expensive for ""not exactly what I needed."" So it's a fine item and someone with different needs will likely be thrilled with it."
4,Not A Bad Coffee Thermos!!,"Hey....IT'S JUST COFFEE!!!But you want it to stay hot and get enough in one cup to wake you up and get you goiong. This 18 ouncer does it. Once you figure out how much coffee to put in the tumbler (add sweetner, cream, milk ect.) without overfilling this is a good choice for the person who needs 18 not 12 or 14oz of coffee in the morning. If you overfill when you screw the cap down you get spill over and this can be quite messy. Coffee stays hot a long time, no staining and (because of the dual wall system) stays cool outside. 1 star off for price. I'm cheap. I think a coffee cup like this should cost $14. All in all a good product and a good buy!"
3,"Keeps it warm, but...","The Nissan travel tumbler keeps my coffee really warm for up to two hours, which is a great feature. BUT, after time, the flip top lid has become a little loose. This isn't so bad if you don't mind a plastic lid flipping on your nose, splashing you with coffee every time you take a drink. I've taken to wearing dark colors.All in all, this mug is easy to clean and durable. I just wish that the Nissan tumbler featured a simpler lid."
3,"It does keep hot coffee hot, but.....",I've had this mug for many years but stopped using it because I can't clean it well enough to prevent a scummy residue from forming underneath a plastic gasket under the lip of the cup. Eventually it got so bad that despite all of my efforts my coffee would pick up flecks of this residue and would spoil the taste of anything it contained. The mug would keep my coffee warm for hours so I am sorry I can no longer use it. I I gave it three stars for these reasons.
2,Grows bacteria!,"The style and size are very nice. HOWEVER, after a year of use, we noticed a funky smell from inside the cup. No amount of washing would get rid of it. Then we noticed if we pushed the rubber ring seal on the inside of the mug, black mildew oozed out from underneath the seal. There is no way to clean the gunk from under the gasket/seal, so we had to toss."
1,leaky,"This cup keeps coffee hot for several hours ,but it leaks with the lid closed POURS OUT AROUND TOP like the drinking hole is open"
4,Good buy,"Comfortable grip. Fits a LOT of coffee. Keeps hot for hours.The drink flap snaps closed and opens easily, which is a problem with a lot of other tumblers.If what you need is a travel tumbler, this one will do the job.As a side note: If fitting in your car's cup holder isn't an issue, the 14-oz Nissan Coffee Mug for Desktop is THE very best mug I've ever bought. The design is very well thought out. I've had it for years and it's still better than anything I've seen or used since."
3,Large enough but not good,"I bought this insulated tumbler because of its size. It is large enough to suit to me, but it has some other problems. As mentioned before the lid is really terrible. It screws on securely but it has a flimsy plastic flip piece to drink out of. I would rather have something I can trust not to spill. If you even tilt the container a bit while it's full it leaks around the edges of the piece that flips.Another problem I have is with the rubber seal near the top. Liquid gets under the seal and has a tendency to stay there. I dry it the recommended way (upside down) and it still retains liquid. I make my own cappuccino in the morning to bring to work...if you don't clean this tumbler out IMMEDIATLEY afterwards it will reek to high heaven. It still sometimes stinks after cleanings because of the water/coffee sitting under the rubber seal."
1,Did not receive correct item,Seller sent the wrong item and was out of the item I ordered.Quick reponse from Seller and quick to refund my money for item.Would do business with again.
1,Leaky,"Yes, it kept my coffee, or beverage warm for hours, but leaked as soon as it was tilted. No good for stashing in your bag, and drinking later."
1,poisoned me!!!,seemed like a good cup at first but after a while i would gag from drinking from it... it lost it's heat holding capacity and made me gag every time i took a sip from it....
4,stays hot,"Like advertised the coffee stays hot, but for me it remains hot for to long. It takes about an hour for the coffee to reach a drinkable temperature. I have found that if you pour cold water from the tap prier to adding the coffee it will reduce the cooling time. I have only owned it for a month but it has held up well in the dishwasher."
3,Not as pictured,"The hardware is fine, but I bought it as a gift for someone who drives a Nissan. In the image shown on Amazon, Nissan is quite pronounced, but on what I received Nissan was in very small letters below THERMOS."
3,NOT Spill proof,"This product is very nice when it comes to keeping liquids hot/cold for long periods of time, but NOT for being spill proof."
4,Really works,"We already owned one of these, I bought another because the first one works so well.It really really keeps drinks hot. Four stars instead of five because the flip lid thingiedoes not make a tight seal, so don't allow it to fall over!"
2,Starbucks actually sells better,This mug leaks as much as a dog drools. The only way to manage this tumbler is not to travel with it. i would recommend the starbucks mugs since they leak a lot less and insulate your drink at least 50% longer than this. maybe my hopes were too high for this mug...
3,Served its purpose,I bought this thinking it was exactly what I was looking for but I was disappointed with the top spot. It worked and did not leak but for some reason it was awkward for me to drink out of
3,An OK item,"I like it but after about a month of use it started leaking from the top. I like how it is larger than most tumblers, and it's not too cheaply made other than the lid issue....."
4,Worth it -- buy it!,"Got mine several years ago, use it every day, and it's still in good shape! How many things can you say that about?!Only one drawback.... you CANNOT tip the thing, it WILL leak ... really fast. Other than that, it's utterly perfect.Just purchased one for my brother for Xmas. I wouldn't hesitate to buy for myself (I'll probably get another for myself soon, just to make sure that I always have one handy) or as a gift."
5,Are you hungry for MORE OF GOD?,It was under Jack and Jean Coleman 's ministry where I became a born-again & Spirit-filled Christian - I'm looking forward to reading the New Edition (up-dated) of Chapter 29 which is the story about an every-day housewife who met Jesus as she was ironing clothes.'Chapter 29' could be your story as well as mine!
2,"Freeze out in Paris, Vol. 5","Freeze out in Paris Vol. 5,I am not sure where things went wrong but Chill out is simply not the same compilation started by David Visan and Co. The music is just not as well mixed and appears to be rushed. The original ambiance is gone. To make matters worse, since Chill out in Paris, Vol. 4, the cover tells you ""Over 100.00 volumes sold with previous volumes"" I am not going to analyze the flea market billboard lingo, but I must say for a Buddha Bar like CD the big number of previously sold albums is unjustifiable. Lots of low quality music sells volumes. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this one. Buy Nirvana Lounge, Buddha Bar or Happiness (by Claude Challe)./."
4,Unspeakable loveliness!,"I wanted to rate this CD 5 stars, but I think that rating should be reserved for rare works that truly stand far above the run of the mill. This one is close, but rates only 4 in my book because, despite the extremely moving tunes and gorgeous lyrics, Beth Nielsen Chapman is only an average vocalist.This is an extremely moving CD from beginning to end. It might not lift your heart, but it will stir your soul. And art is about moving you in some way, even if it is not always upbeat and happy.Other reviewers have commented on the famous singers who have lent thier talents to back-up vocals. This, I think, is a tribute to the strength of the material that Ms. Chapman has created.Other reviewers have also commented on indvidual songs. The one that moved me most is called, ""Sleep"" as I recall. On it, Ms. Chapman sings of ""The same heartcrushing sorrow, the same unspeakable loveliness... all at the same time."" These lyrics could describe the entire CD."
4,ALL COMES DOWN TO LOVE,"Chapman is an insightful, intelligent songwriter who draws from personal experiences to create vivid and emotional songs.DEEPER STILL explores the loss of her husband and her own battle with cancer. The songs are both life-affirming and bittersweet. Beth is vocally supported by artists like John Prine, Vince Gill, Bonnie Raitt and Emmylou Harris. My favorite cuts: Every December Sky, All Comes Down to Love, Sleep and There's a Light.Chapman sings with conviction and heartfelt emotion, sharing her soul with her audience---the sign of a true artist."
4,Preschooler loved but it is now out of Print-Why???,My preschooler loves this book but I can't seem to get it because it is not printed anymore. I can only find it at the library. Please publish again.
2,"Good Concept, not fully baked","It's a nice concept if done right.. I found this unit to have some big drawbacks.- Requires special Windows PC server software, rather than being able to access a standard file share. So, it will not work with Macs or Linux machines.- The user interface is not very intuitive or flexible (e.g. no MP3 playback while displaying images, which would make for a nice slideshow feature).- JPEG image display would greatly benefit from 720p or 1080i display modes. 480p is not good enough to do most pictures justice.- The media files available for playback are limited. MPEG Video files are limited to 3Mbps streaming rate. So, if you plan on playing your MiniDV home movies that were exported to MPEG/DVD format, forget about it. Also, it will only allow playback of files on the hard drive of the windows machine, it will not allow you to add MP3/MPEG files from a network share."
1,Poor Wireless Support,"Maybe it works with some of the wireless cards out there, but who can justify purchasing one model after another from their ""supported"" list until you find one that really works? I purchased a Belkin F5D6020 after seeing it on their ""supported"" list, only to find out that not all versions of the F5D6020 are supported. Did they bother to indicated that though? No! So I'm stuck with a ""supported"" card which doesn't work. I'm not about to continue to purchase ""supported"" cards in the hope that I might just get lucky and get one that really works. They really missed the boat with their documentation and tech support on this product..."
2,Won't work with a firewall and the music interface is bad.,"Player installed just fine but will not work with a firewall on the server computer. Called tech support and they told me they are telling their customers to disable their firewalls. I find that absolutely amazing in this day and age.The interface for playing music will show you albums without the artists names, artists without the album names or playlists that display song titles without artist or album information. With a ripped CD collection of over 500 titles and without the ability to identify what I'm listening to I find this to be only of use for background listening.I'm a tech junkie so I'll hang on to this for the time being, but I'm certain this device will soon be overshadowed by something more capable and intuitive that provides for network security as well."
5,Jon Cain does it again!,"Jon Cain is one of the most talented musicians of our time. He has spent years perfecting melodic rock with his fellow band mates in Journey. However, I always look forward to his solo releases. This CD was worth the wait. He really came through with infectious lyrics and beautiful piano playing. Any fan of good music will be more than satisfied with this wonderful CD."
1,Able? not Cain!,"OMG this was bad. Sappy, cringingly bad lyrics (see ""Shine on Chicago"").While his arena rock pedegree is sure to lure in some fish, this disc is so poor Jon makes horrific 70's singer-songwriter Dan Hill sound like a rock god.The best I can say is that at times his vocal tones mimmicked a poor man's Jules Shear, but that would be too cold a slap in the face to polar bear fans from North to South.But Cain a major talent? ...more like the world's smallest pianist.I did enjoy his nostalgic spin on ""Faithfully""; a duet with Mica Roberts, but overall ""WHERE I LIVE"" was not a sentimental journey.""Sometimes She Breaks"" and sometimes she breaks wind, either way this CD blows."
2,These scissors pull hairs out as often as they cut them,"It's painful using these ""surgical"" scissors to trim my mustache. They pull hairs out as often as they cut them."
5,A WONDERFUL (yet underrated) film,"This film was one of the best films I have ever seen! It is the story of a wealthy, repectable man named George Hurstwood (interpreted by the great Laurence Olivier) who gives up his privileged lifestyle for his love of Carrie(played by Jennifer Jones). Not only was the acting excellent, but the costumes were really gorgeous! It certainly is a romantic film as well as a dramatic one. Jennifer Jones is very lovely and Laurence Olivier is extremely handsome. He had such classy good looks!Both lead actors give superb performances, but it is Laurence Olivier's performance that shines most briliantly! His interpretation of Hurstwood's decline from wealthy to homeless is heartbreaking. The subtlty with which he conveys his despair and anguish in his eyes is enough to bring tears to your eyes. I was almost crying at the end, which by the way is not a happy one.Nevertheless, this film is well worth buying. I guarantee you will not regret it!!"
3,movie adaptation: 4-,"we were disappointed in the movie version of the book ""Sister Carrie"" by Theodore Dreiser.... acting was acceptable in fact: at times superb.... but the screen adaption lacked the drama of the different characters, especially the interpretation of Carrie as poor girl entering the life in the big city: would one show her as a squeeky-clean well dressed girl? the movie is fine if you have not read the book before.... read the book afterwards and experience the nuances of a psychological masterpiece...."
2,Even Olivier misses his mark here,"in this disappointing screen adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's powerful study of social darwinism, ""Sister Carrie"". That novel is one of the most riveting I've ever read, and I was looking forward to see this film. Yet Olivier played the Hurstwood character all wrong; he lacked the smooth bravura of the man who originally seduced away the Jennifer Jones character from her earlier lover played by Eddie Albert. Eddie Albert's performance, incidentally, is the only one that comes close to what Dreiser wrote. And Jennifer Jones gives us a Carrie who is sympathetic and nice, and Dreiser's Carrie is neither. This is one of those occasions where you wonder why they bothered to acquire the rights to the novel if they had no intention of realizing it accurately as a movie. Take my advice, and read the book."
4,Have plenty of kleenex...a real tear-jerker. I loved it!!!,"A very sensitive and convincing film about ""forbidden"" romance. Tragedy at its best!"
4,Carrie 1952,"Based on Theodore Dreiser's novel, Sister Carrie. Jennifer Jones plays Carrie Meeber, a young woman who moves to Chicago to better herself. Carrie learns the facts of life, that the big city is filled with selfish people. She goes through two lovers, a young Eddie Albert and an older man whom she ruins. Laurence Olivier plays Hurstwood, the man who risks all to recapture his youth. Carrie loves the attention, and Hurstwood has his moment. My favorite scene is where he gives her a new hat. The relationship runs its course. Carrie becomes an actress, and Hurstwood hits the skids. Dreiser's prose is clumsy."
2,a great disappointment,"I am a great admirer of Leonard Bernstein, but I must confess that this is the worst performance I have ever heard from him. Tempos are misjudged, emotional effects are too calculated, the singers are barely adequate--in short, terrible. The opera doesn't even sound like La Boehme. I could hardly believe my ears. Little wonder than the opera and classical recording guides seldom even mention it. Definitely a non-contender."
2,My Senior Cat Disliked...srsly!,"The tabs are quite hard and even though my senior cat (age 16) has all of his teeth (in good shape), he couldn't come close to chewing these. I crushed them...they're like little rocks...but he refused any food I mixed them with, even his most favorite meals. Didn't matter if I mixed 1 tab or more...he wouldn't eat the mixture. None of the other cats in the household would touch anything they were mixed with either. They aren't seniors but I thought in 1/2 doses they might be OK to give to younger cats 3-4 days a week. The cats decided otherwise. The 2 good things were that they did ship quickly and were well-packed. I'm satisfied with the vendor but not the product. I wish I could have tried a small sample pack first...we would not have ordered."
4,Healthy,Good product....recommended by my veternarian for my cat. Good for cats getting up there in age. My cat is now 18 years old
3,"Low budget, not great, but a decent family-friendly movie...","This is a clean, family-friendly movie. Obviously low-budget, so the acting is very cheesy much of the time (the supporting cast especially), but its still entertaining. Some scenes honestly didn't even make sense - they were apparently intended to be humorous, but there was no large-scale purpose for them. My main complaint would be that the beginning of the movie was much too slow (the backstory of why the actress needed rehab and ended up in Utah) and then the rest of the movie happened so fast it didn't even flow well. The best thing about it was KC Clyde's character, as well as Erin Chambers. I wish there had been more scenes spent on their relationship and back story."
3,Heber Holiday,"This is a fish-out-of-water story set in Utah by the usual LDS genre suspects...but without the LDS angle.The movie starts off pretty weak with some horrible acting. Characters on the Hollywood side are outright cartoonish. But once our Hollywood diva escapes rehab (don't act surprised that she escapes...it says so right on the box), everything goes warm and fuzzy, and we've got a pleasant little love triangle (quadrangle?) between a best friend, a diva, and a yodeling psycho.There's no foul language and almost no alcohol (it IS a movie with a rehab bend for Pete's sake!) It's adorable, harmless, and will leave you smiling. Hey...Michael Birkeland is in it. What could POSSIBLY go wrong."
2,dissapointed,looking like an underdevolped WOW interface didnt help this lackluster game. For as long as it spent in development youd think a well polished piece of work woud have arrived but the class development as well as subpar quest story lines leave alot to be desired. As a huge LOTR fan i eagerly awaited this game but think it fell far short of bering the name of such a great work of fiction.
3,LOTRO : Reviewed by a gamer for a gamer,"I bought Lord Of The Rings Online or LOTRO and found it to be quite fun, However since I left World of Warcraft to play LOTRO and the game has'nt yet evolved that far yet I found it boring. Plus once to get to level 40, Unless you have 4 friends that are your level ,On the same quest, and Are on when your on, you have to grind to level 50. lvl 50 is the level cap. So in conclusion, Its $[...] a month for a good game that is lacking because its so new. If you do buy this game tho, Either be a Hunter, Guardian, or Champion. All the others are useless trust me I know.Happy Gaming: Mountaindew lvl 16 Lore-master....Nimrodel."
2,WoW lite,"This game, while fun, is basically WoW lite, the graphics are about on par with Everquest (the first one) controls are a little off, tap the left key and turn 45 degrees, the quests are fun and the tutorial was interesting but it reminds me of Horizons, a few mobs spread out and large areas of nothing, not to mention about 10 of a quest mob for 25+ players hunting them, so there is alot of running around and waiting, the gear is pretty lame tho the game is suppose to not be loot driven, but there isn't really much else to do other than build a rep for yourself by completing the little achievements you get for doing quests. All in all, there is potential here... I'd wait a year or so before buying it, too many bugs and not enough substance... another MMO rushed to the shelves before it was finished I am afraid."
4,It's the Story,"Yes, it's a reasonably similar online game, but the story makes all the difference. The developers have done a good job at making you feel that you are truely an inhabitant of Middle Earth. The story is so engrossing that there are times where you gain a level, and you are surprised!The graphics are fabulous, but be warned that you need upper end hardware to bring out the best.Highly recommended"
5,Bad Player Review,"I have to admit, I'm not a great game player! I don't play a lot of games, although I do enjoy gaming. I'm horrible at finding out the secret tricks, my reflexes are nil, my patience and time, minimal.But I have tried out a few MMOGs, such as City of Heroes and World of Warcraft.And more importantly, I'm a huge Lord of the Rings fan.I have to say that so far (and I'm slowly slogging through the world... probably doomed to be a lower-level player forever!), the game is a lot of fun! It's easy to use. I'm not frustrated in finding out what to click on and where. Most things reveal themselves in good time. The Quests have been do-able for someone as awful at games as I am. And I've had a good time wandering about the lands. The visuals are nice. Not any major bugs I can see. The game is working whenever I actually do find the time to get online. So far I've really enjoyed it!"
4,"WOW killer, probably not, but it's still good!","I'm a avid fan of WOW, and this game is the only thing that comes close to it. There are alot of ""shared"" ideas between the 2 games, but enough of a difference to make it a unique playing experience. I play both (70/30) now, and it's a nice change of pace."
4,LOTR Rocks,This game rocks. Whole of middle earth to explore and decent selection of adventures to mix it up. Plus a decent monthly fee that doesn't break the bank. Sweet.
2,Nothing new,"While the eviroments are quite lovely the animal and player models are ugly and their animation is choppy. Nothing new in terms of game play and the quest lines are full of the old running back and forth between quest givers before you are actually given a quest other than ""Talk to So-n-so""."
4,Perhaps I am just partial to world of warcraft.,"This is a very beautiful game, however, unless you are a die hard LOTR fan, you might get bored quite easily. There aren't as many classes or races to choose from, although there is an option known as ""monster play"" which offers something that WOW doesn't. A very good game, but it just didn't keep my attention for very long."
4,Fun game,"Overall i'm having lots of run playing this game. The world is interesting, the graphics are very realistic. However i wish [...] discriptions where clearer, often times they are very confusing and completely off which makes you run around and waste time looking for stuff. Also if you don't have an up to date computer you'll have lots of lag. But i guess this is to be expected of the latest games."
4,Don't Purchase This Game!!!,"It's free to play now, so there is no reason to spend money buying the software. Simply go to their website and download the client! For a free to play game this one cant be beat."
1,Disappointed,"The game reminded me of a cross between Guild Wars' restricted pathing and EQ1's stick-figure arm motions. The best thing I can say about it was the initial character creation screens were very in depth. So in depth, that you can expect to skip it altogether and choose a preconfigured character to get started in a timely fashion the first time out. It had the feel of a single player game with good narration and limited social interaction. If you're like me, playing WoW while you wait for the next interesting MMO to come out, you can rest easy choosing to save your money on this one."
3,Lord of the Retread,"Have you played World of Warcraft? If you have then this is a less impressive copy of that game. Virtually everything I tried was identical to WoW. However, what was missing was the impressive richness of WoW. Instead the world (at least what I saw of it) was dull and uninviting. Using the mouse to move was sporadic at best.I was very disapointed. I had been lookiing forward to this game."
1,Dont waste your money on this...,"...Unless you like endless hours of grinding for crafting materials and gold to pay the insane costs of everything. Or like being constantly under attack just traveling from point A to point B. Or like Boss fights where you're always fighting hordes of adds. Or like to be endlessly stunned, disarmed, crippled, snared, poisoned, bled, diseased or otherwise impeded whenever you fight anything. Did I mention the quests that have you running all over Eriador taking hours to do just for a few experience points and crappy rewards?Getting to level 50 is long and frustrating because in order to level reasonably fast you need to do the quests and most of the quests require a 6 person group to do, and it's difficult to get such a group together. Leveling up solo is your only other option and that takes a tremendously long time to do.So... If you like being frustrated and bored then this game is for YOU!"
5,A phenominal read.,"Dorothy Livesay has been my inspiration. This was the first book of hers that I had the pleasure to read, and this book completely and utterly wowed me. If you are a fan of esquisite poetry you must have this in your collection. Phenominal words from a brilliant woman."
3,it was cool record,"this band has been around for a good while&I have dug there laid-back mid tempo vibe over the years. 'What can I do"" was my cut on here. I use to groove to that Jam back in 89-90. i dig the Instrumentation overall on this album."
4,Keep coming back to this CD,"Great CD, I keep it in heavy rotation. I own one other DJ Dan CD ""Beats for Freaks"" but, I think I like this one even more.Favorites are:DiscotekaBaked From ScratchFreeform 5 ""No more conversations""Macca ""The Big Rinse""Bass PhenonmenonObliebankChopshopLove 4 the weekend"
2,wtf?,"I bought this CD without listening to the tracks because DJ Dan has had some very great CD's. However, after listening to Lift 2, I can honestly say that I am disappointed. DJ Dan is known for his funk, but this CD was pretty much electronica. Had I known, I surely would never have bought this CD. If you are a fan of funky house, stay away from this one!"
1,DJ DAN....Gone Wrong!,"I actually heard about this release a while back, but since I'm a big-time Dan supporter, I had to buy this to add to my collection of his sets. This is one set I would like to forget about. DJ Dan has been known for his Up-tempo,Funky-Tech-House & Filtered-Disco styles throughout, now he comes out with some mind-twisting Electro trash, which is annoying, some Traditional House DJ's such as the undercover agents-SF (JT & Lance) & Donald Glaude have swiched over to this style and I think it's a shame, as these DJ's have lifted the House scene & treated the headz for years. If your a true funky house-head, check out Mark Farina's new OM release and Migel Migs as well, but stay away from this disc and Electro-trash as well"
2,STAY AWAY FROM ARCHOS!!!,Product: Archos PMA400 (430)This company is horrible.I can guartentee you 3 things if you purchase this unit:1) You will have a problem within the first week of ownership.2) The tech support will attempt to solve ALL problems by telling you to reformat the unit and install the operating system again. THIS IS THERE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING! EVRYTHING!!!3) I gaurentee you the tech suport suggestion of reformatting the harddrive will NOT fix your problem.My first unit was defective - the new unit will not record audio.Not a complete waste of $650 because the video recording has worked well on the second unit - but when you pay this much for something EVERYTHING should work.Great concept - poor technology.
5,New Spin on Old Form,"I think CHICAGO NOIR tries to redefine what noir might mean in 2005, and does a fine job avoiding the hard-boiled cliches of the 1930's. The short fiction is well written and takes the reader into many places that might not be considered tradionally noir. I think the above reviewer, Jerry Saperstein, needs to lighten up and let modernity flow. His president is certainly having a hard time with that himself."
3,Ok,"It was okay, but not the best tales from Chicago there could be. On the upside, if you are thinking of becoming a writer, this will certainly give you some encouragement. Whatever you are writing can't be any worse than the stories in here."
5,Terrific - for 5 years!,"Unlike Princess, I've used this product for 5 years and LOVE it. (Though not from this particular seller - I've bought from a local distributor). The product has worked incredibly well for me. I have noticed that I need to take it on an empty stomach and can't eat immediately after taking it or it won't be as effective. But, otherwise, it works great and has kept my cravings at bay for years. I have chronic fatigue syndrome and after YEARS of keeping my weight down through exercise, cannot tolerate workouts anymore. In order to keep my weight down, I've had to rely solely on a limited diet; and that doesn't always work with CFS due to mitochondrial damage. (Just FYI, I'm not a distributor. I'm only a customer who feels this product is A++ and I recommend it to all my patients who have problems with cravings)."
2,Poor quality,"This product amplifies satellite signals, but not as strong as some other brands. While most other in-line amplifiers are rated 12-20 dB (the range of amplification), this one is rated 13 dB, without a range. My guess is 13 dB is the maximum it can do.The item I got apparently is an open-box item or has been returned. But Amazon did not say anything about this."
5,Bike Gear Foam Cushion Handlebar Grips Black,"I actually purchased these grips for my four-prong cane handle as replacement for the grips that wore down. I had looked everywhere in medical supply and could not find them, when it was suggested that I look at bike grips. I actually did find one company on the internet that would sell a replacement grip (l) for twice the price, of these grips and twice the shipping charges. These grips fit my handle perfectly and are the same as the ones used for these type of canes, and since I purchased a pair, I have an extra when this one wears out. I am very pleased."
5,A great asset to my shop.,"I have no way to test this tool except to use it to calibrate my tools and if the woodworking job comes out perfect then I know this tool was dead on for what I use it for. I have 4 Incra guaranteed squares(5"" square, 5"" 45 degree, 7"" square, and 7"" 45 degree) and absolutely use them religiously to calibrate all my tools (table saw, jointer, planer, miter saw, band saw, drill press, circular saw, router table, etc.). While they are expensive I learned in an engineering class that you have to pay more for better tolerances and the expense here is well worth it over a cheap square. Yet there are more expensive squares out there and the Incras are ""guaranteed"" so if they are not perfect they will make it perfect. If you purchase these I don't see how you will be disappointed as they are one of the best asset you can buy for quality work."
3,"45 degrees yes, but not also 90 degrees as advertis","I've got both the 45 and 90. This one is a great 45 degree tool and performs as well as the 90 degree model.It is advertised as also being a 90 square, standing on it's head (see picture is ad for detail), but mine is way off 90 compared to my 90 degree which I have verified as being square.I know I bought it for 45 degrees, but it's very pricey and this was a let down from Incra."
2,Do I need to spend $50 for this ?,"I am not sure why this is so expensive but I would recommend looking for cheaper options than this unless you are a machinist and not a woodworker.I found cheaper option from glad stone tools , which is equally accurate but way cheaper.Avoid this one unless you want scintific accurary , which is 'Over exacerated' when it comes to woodworking !!."
3,A Sometimes Funny Book,"""Ohio man, 79, pronounced dead, but says he feels much better now""""Boys cause as many pregnancies as girls""""Bush gets briefing on drought; says rain needed to end it""For anyone who has ever watched The Tonight Show with Jay Leno these real but ridiculous headlines from American newspapers are easily recognizable. In this book Jay Leno has compiled numerous headlines contributed by the viewers of The Tonight Show. This book is broken up into 14 different sections covering such topics as little-known facts, crime and punishment, family fun, death, and much more. Also, most of the headlines are accompanied by some type of comment by Leno. I must admit, some of these headlines and some of Leno's comments are pretty humorous. Although this book will not make you fall down laughing, in all probability it will cause a smile and elicit a chuckle. Overall, it's a pretty enjoyable book."
4,A Treat for Headlines Fans,"I always try to watch ""The Tonight Show"" on nights when Jay Leno has Headlines. That is by far my favorite feature on the show. This book is a compilation of humorous headlines, misprints, captions, and ads from the program. It includes lines like ""Design a safe nuclear power plant and win $500,"" ""32 Ignorant Enough to Serve on North Jury,"" and ""One Body in Yard Identified"" next to a picture of President and Mrs. Reagan with shovels at a groundbreaking ceremony. I enjoyed this book a great deal, but I found that Headlines work better on TV than in print. I missed Jay Leno's expressions and comments, although the book tries to reproduce them. But there's still a lot of laughs, and every fan of Headlines will want to read this."
3,"So bad, but so good","If you're looking for legit entertainment: Don't buy this. If you want to get some friends together and make fun of this completely bizarre and borderline incomprehensible story, DO buy this. The English dub is so bad, on the quality scale it goes below ""awful,"" bypasses ""Crap"" completely, and circles back to ""mildly amusing."" It's easy and fun to watch this and just laugh at the poorly acted dialogue."
3,Ska Was Ska before Black Happy,"Ska was Ska before Black Happy and Black Happy is not Ska.The previous reviewer needs to get out of Montana. I sat at a Fishbone show in Pullman with Paul the singer and let me tell you Fishbone is Ska. Black Happy was one of the best bands to come out of the Spokane area and at that time there were alot ofgreat bands.The live shows got you up and dancing and when they did a Led Zep cover it was off the hook.Two drummers and a mean horn section with heavy guitar and Pauls lyrics, it was hard to keep up. Unfortunalty the Greed set in and they got a record deal by dumping the horn section and changing the name to Shoveljerk and thats exactly what they became. Black Happy is a must in any collection.But who the hell is selling $44.95 Friendly Dog Salad CD's.Your insane."
5,Most stolen cd in my collection,"A unique musical experience, Black Happy is energetic, fun and uses a range of unexpected instruments. I've had to buy this cd again and again, this will be the fifth time, as it mysteriously goes missing and is ""rediscovered"" later at a friend's house.This is a Must Have CD for any collection."
5,Worth EVERY penny!,"Every song on this cd is outstanding!!! Motivating, energizing and fun music!! These guys rock!"
5,Interesting,"Very interesting. Great conversation piece, or great gift for someone who needs to know everything. I could give mine to my grandfather as a gift, but I don't want to give it up. 5 Stars for a book covering everything."
4,A Practical Book,"Practical Piano PedagogyThis book gives a good introduction of piano studio management. Some of the sample business forms are especially useful for the beginner teacher who is wondering where should I start. The description of the beginner piano method books are excellent and practical summaries. There are some wonderful pictures of hand position and of preparation exercise for two-notes slurs. I would like to see more preparatory exercises for piano technics. For the learning styles, I would prefer to see the actual well-known teaching theory names, such as Piaget, Skinner, audio, visual, multi-intellgence and so on, instead of using fable animal names that are hard to follow and distracts the content of the theory. I enjoy the discussion on group teaching and jazz teaching. In my opinion, this book is a good resource book."
4,informative and fun,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this book, incredibly entertaining as far as repair manuals go. The descriptive, opinionated writing style had me reading about repairs I had no need to do currently.High entertainment value-needs more pictures (maybe with an updated version?)"
1,Skip this book,Save your money this is a HORRIBLE book. A bad trainer and a bad writer do not make for a winning combination.
1,Shock Collars And Shocking Dogs As Training,All about shock collar training not what I was expecting! A sad read and there needs be a disclaimer about the subject matter. I would not have purchased the book had I realized the writer used shock collars.Read Nop's Trials for a novel or Dog Is My Co-Pilot for short stories that are uplifting and honor the bond between dog and owner.
3,liz is so naive!,liz is supposed to be smart and a star reporter! who knew she could be so dumb as to fall for finn? i say wake up liz! otherwise this book was good but that ruined it for me.
3,it was okay...,"I believe that Elizabeth was too nieve in this book. It was good, but I still wish that Elizabeth would get back with Todd, because they were the best together. I hope in the future that this will happen. It was a great book though. Looking forward to you next book. Lilly"
3,All the Hype,"From a Nobel-Prize-winning novel, I expected a whole lot more than this. Am I amiss for expecting greatness? Instead, this novel is confusing and hard to follow, and not in an incompetent reader sort of way. The novel pushes the envelope with its hyperbolic discussion of male sexuality and the male tendency/necessity to gaze at the female. Maybe in the height of the feminist-crazed, literary world, this translation from German was all the hype.Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"
1,A vulgar and disturbing book,"This must be the worst book written by a Nobel Prize winning author in the history of the award. The main character is thoroughly petty and dislikable, and the sex and violence in the book are incredibly vulgar. This novel is a memorable one for me, but for the wrong reasons."
1,"Piano Teacher, worst book ever","Our book club of 10 professional women all agreed that this was the worst, most poorly written, book in our 7 years as a Club. Reading this book was more strenuous than plowing a corn field in 1905. I tried several times to read it but couldn't quite reach page 40 when I gave up. Since the book wasn't on Kindle, I called my library and was told ""possible 3 weeks."" I drove 15 miles to another library and was totally disappointed with the waste of time and money.Marilynn Clark"
2,ramble.....,"This book rambles on and on and... ON! It could have been a great story, but fell way short. Not worth the time!"
3,I totally agree about the Nobel Prize but this book isnt hal,"This book isnt half bad. Movie was decent too though not enough for the hullabaloo at cannes. Clearly the nobel prize was political (let's give it to everyone who can't stand America. Would Nobel have wanted this?) and mediocre to very good (as opposed to excellent) talents have won (Don't even get me started on Yasser Arafat's peace prize) I can only appreciate the story/symbolism in the book, it may lose some flavor in the translation."
1,"Review of ""The Piano Teacher""","This is one of the more dreadful books I have attempted to read in the last 10 years--one of the rare ones that I found impossible to finish it was so awful. The writing style was obscure, the characters uninteresting, and the book was actually rather disgusting, with themes of cruelty and s/m.One wonders how on earth ""The Piano Teacher"" won the Nobel Prize--but, then again, so did Barack Obama--neither deserved in any way that was discernible.Don't waste your money on this one. I'm sorry that I did."
1,hated it,"the paino teacher was a waste of my time. how could this book have won any prize? it was disgusting, confusing, poorly written and just a lowsey story."
1,why?,"Where is the religious right protesters? What in the world is that suppose to mean? I can tell you where I am and it is not reading this book. A waste of time. Every one knows about depravity, why read about it? I feel sorry for any one who is in this kind of shape and I will pray for them.I still don't get the religious right thing?"
3,"Extremely well-written, disturbing story","A fascinating book albeit in a train wreck, can't-look-away vein. Erica, a piano teacher at a University in Austria, and a failed concert pianist, is fast approaching middle age. Dominated by her overly possessive mother, she relieves her boredom and disappointment through voyeurism and self-mutilation. When a much younger student shows an interest in her, Erica takes a stab at escaping her isolated life with Mother. Will she succeed this time?Not for the faint of heart, an unflinching look into the minds of three damaged personalities - each one trying to come out on top."
2,Couldn't finish this...,"I was taken aback by this book, and had to abruptly throw it down near the end. Now I can hardly even look at the cover without feeling slightly ill. Perhaps I missed the point - perhaps I'm too squeemish - but I could NOT read the end of this book. I'm confused about why it won a nobel prize, certainly, and as an avid reader and literature major, I have read quite broadly. When I got this book I had no idea I would find it so disturbing and that it would be so sadomasochistic. I thought I should warn other readers of this. (The reason I have it two stars is that the writer is obviously gifted and parts are written beautifully.)"
1,strange,This was one book that seemed to be written with a lesson I just did not get. I would not buy it again or recommend it. It is not worth my valuable time.
4,Painting with words,"If you appreciate viciously eloquent prose, this novel is for you. The writing is both clever and creative. The story didn't quite match up the quality of the writing, but it was disturbing and tragic enough to be memorable.The piano teacher is set in Vienna during the 1980's. It is a story about a failed concert pianist who has a parasitic relationship with her mother. The combination of sexual repression and learned submissiveness cause her to go overboard and enter a destructive relationship with one of her students.Another sad and moving story about the misery that ensues when one human being tries to control another. Brilliantly mouth watering prose, deserves at least 4.5 stars."
2,"Pretentious, stilted and melodramatic","Although there are interesting issues brought up in this book, (among them, a suffocatingly intimate mother-daughter relationship) the writing is so insufferably stilted that I could barely read the book.The story centers around a piano teacher in her late thirties (often melodramatically described as ""decaying"" and ""old"") who lives with her controlling mother. She mutilates herself whenever she feels sad and lonely.A virile young student with conventional ideas of romance falls in love with the her. However, the teacher's concept of love is of the S&M; variety. The handsome student misunderstands her intentions towards him and interprets them as rejection. His wounded pride eventually leads him to beat her up and rape her, breaking her nose and rib. The teacher walks around in a short dress afterwards, carrying around a knife to mutilate herself further.This book tries too hard to be disturbing and the results are over-the-top and irritating."
2,a circle of stars...,"I read Sacajawea, and savored every word. but this book startedoff on the wrong foot with me. They go net fishing forOysters, and FIND THEM! (Oysters live on the sea bottom and nevermove for their entire adult life)This book might be well-researched, but the author takes liberties where she shouldn't. IF attention to detailis important to you, this book will frustrate.Sometimes the story line is a bit confusing, the author blastsforth with information that she assumes (?) you know, and eventually, through details, you figure it out."
2,Not a good read!,Disjointed. Anachronistic. (The Arab was worshiping Allah! The folks in Wales were preparing corn!) Other disturbing happenings. I really love words and history. This one wasn't that good.
4,enough cool to be listened,"One of the best parts of this CD is you can listen various kinds of artists gathering same concept ""cool"". I think you enjoy this CD."
4,This series is fabulous!,"This is part of a wonderful series of books, part of the ""Grandma's Attic"" series. It could be compared to the ""Little House"" books with a bit more of a Christian theme. It's wonderful for children from 8 to 99!"
3,Good but dated,"I quite enjoyed reading this. In particular the most interesting ascpect is the way that a small network is slowly built up, adding features like NFS/automount, NIS+/DNS, snedmail.On the downside, much of the material is dated and no longer applies to Solaris 10 [and OpenSolaris]. For instance, chapter 2 on boot rc scripts is now obsolete, replaced by the new services architecture. Also, the chapter on PPP is probabably of limited use/interest - who uses dial-up modems nowadays?"
5,Love Pearl Buck,Pearl Buck won the Nobel Prize for Lit for The Good Earth. She was raised by her missionary parents in China. In The Story Bible. She take away many religious implications and leaves us with the great story that the bible is.
2,William Gibson he is not.,"I read this book over a year ago, and rememberbeing extremely disappointed by it at the time.As cyber-fiction goes it was average, but themost lasting impression (on me anyway) was thepoor quality of the writing. I seem to remember having to put it down several times as a result ofsome extremely prosaic or downright clichedparagraphs.Now, if I had to say something positive to conclude, it would have to be ""Read Excession byIain M. Banks""; That is genuinely original."
5,"GREAT, LOVED EVEY BIT OF IT!","All I have to say is that I hope that Mr. Besher decides to write another book. I started into RIM by reading the accolades and notes from other authors on the front and back of the book. They are all true. Not since Neuroumancer, has a book captivated and held onto my interest. It has everything from intrigue, that of Bond, and smarts , that of Holmes. I've since read the book four more times since them. I think I may do it again. Bravo Besher.Webs_25"
1,complete trash,This is without a doubt one of the worst books I have ever read.trust me ... don't waste your time.
3,A Fairly Good book,"A fairly interesting book with nice photographs...not too much elaboration on the dolls themselves including their collectability and prices...this would have been more helpful. Other than that, it's a fairly good book."
4,Business Card Creator fulfills a need,The need was for a few standardized cards for each of a large number of people. Creator did the job well and efficiently.
3,Are they only instrumental?,"I downloaded Kiss of Death, and it's okay. But are all the tracks like this? I assumed it was just an interlude or something. If they are all like this, then I suggest they get a singer. I'm giving it three stars because I believe that they have potential (they just need a singer)."
1,Er...what?,"Well, I got the free downloads, and now...well...I'm deleting them. An abominable mix of disco, Mexican music, supermarket Muzak and dodgy rock is something I really hope I never have to encounter again."
5,"Finally, some REAL music!!!","Point blank, this disc is absolutely incredible. A must have for any real music fan......"
5,Super fast delivery,"I was throwing my daughter, who was turning 7, a carnival/circus party. I was directed to the Amazon site through a google search when looking for carnival party music. I ordered the CD on Friday and chose to have it delivered by standard delivery. Much to my surprise, it was delivered on Monday. The CD is great and just what my daughter's party needed to help set the mood. It was well packaged, so there is no need to worry about it being received broken. I'll definitely order from Amazon again."
5,Great for a Circus Event,"We had a public event for kids and families, hosting about 750 people. This music was a perfect backdrop for our circus themed day, putting everybody in the right spirit for clowns, carnival games, and a circus animal treasure hunt."
4,A musical trip to the circus,I bought this CD to have some circus themed music for running scenes for a Pathfinder game that would take place in a circus. I was not disappointed as that's exactly what I got. If you want or need circus music for a party or an event you can't go wrong with buying this disc.
5,superb sounds from the circus,This is the finest musical redition of the circus I have ever heard. If you really like the Big Top and all that goes with it (sans the elephant smell) you'll be sure to like this one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
5,perfect circus party music,"I purchased this for my daughter's 1st birthday party, and it was fabulous background music for the event."
1,Disappointing piece of crap,"We bought one of these yesterday [...] and brought it home to put on our cat that had stitches he insisted on licking. Once on, the bottom snap broke and rendered this expensive piece of plastic useless.I highly DO NOT recommend this item. You are better off buying a piece of animal clothing that will cover the would or infection or whatever.[...]In the end, DO NOT BUY THIS. It broke within 5 minutes of its first and only use.We were extremely disappointed."
1,Short term use,"Not really impressed with this. I have a large dog and she is not very graceful. Within a couple of days of her running into things it cracked down the whole side. So I used clear tape to patch it back up. Within another couple of days it cracked down the other side. One last patch there, and then the snaps that hold the cone together broke off. Waste of money and time in my opinion."
3,I gave these as a gift,My Daughter is a groomer and I bought these to keep her safe. The large one may fit a small to medium dog but length wize lacks for keeping the dogs mouth from being a problem snapping and biting around it.
3,Need actual inch size of S / M / L and XL,"I would love to order this, but there is no chart explaining what are the actual sizes of S / M / L etc..., can you please list those?"
2,Cheap,I concur with the previous review. My puppy broke this collar within 2 days. This is not a sturdy collar and other brands were able to fair just fine with the puppy after this one broke.
3,E-Collar wasn't big enough and my dog broke it.,"Maybe I didn't measure right but I did the measurement and was recommended the medium. When I put it on it would slide down on the neck so her nose would jut out. Somehow she managed to crack and break it. Didn't last long, but my dog really didn't like it. Maybe they need to be more contained while wearing it."
1,Disappointed,"Son got it on Christmas day, went outside in the light rain because he was so excited. The top decal rubbed off."
3,Fun for the whole block,"This was a fun combo pack for our whole family, with room to ride, it was quite the hit with my grandson"
5,great gift!,I got this for my 6 year old cousin for his birthday and he got on it first thing. Definitely a great deal!
2,get what you pay for,"bought this for my son at age 5. useless except for on extremely smooth surfaces. the helmet, bearings, trucks, and wheels are extremly poor quality. the pads are o.k. This board is hard to ride period, no matter what age. save your money and do some research before going this route. to get a decent set up you will be spending at least $200. but if you just want your kid to complain about how the board sucks, get this set up."
2,You get what you pay for,I am a long time skateboarder. My 5 year old son got on my longboard and did awsome so I decided he should have his own. I also wanted him to have wristgaurds and elbow and kneepads. After reading the reviews I decided that this was a good bargain. The pads and wristgaurd are fine however the helmet is way to big for a child. It fits me so at the risk of looking silly maybe I'll use it. The board looks nice but the trucks are plastic and the wheels didn't spin to well. I loosened the nuts and sprayed some lubricant and they spin much better. However the board does not move under the wieght of a grown up. For a five year old it still not so great but atleast he has some protective gear and as for the helmet he just uses the bike one he already has.
3,is happy with the skateboard,really like is product for the price and my nephew loves it too. its very cool skateboard.its has nice graphics.but wheels are cheap. but still would buy again
1,R.I.P Brad,"311 is a shameless Sublime rip-off. I love Sublime and hoped 311 would be similarly good, unfortunately it's not. It seems pretty juvenile, but maybe my taste in music is just weird. Listen to ""Stand By Your Van"" by Sublime instead of this stupid crap."
2,A pretty sucky CD,I listen to the radio alot. I hear lots of 311 songs on it. But nothing from Grassroots. There are no big hits onthis CD. Theres no point to all the rambling on in this music. Stay away fom this retarded music. It would be more useful to buy some viagra for your grandpa than waste your money on this crap.
5,Incredible album.,If there is one 311 album that you should own its this one. What a great CD. Better than all the rest. Noteworthy mentions are music and self-titled. This is a must have.
5,Great CD,Its just like 311. They also a few more rap-style songs than some of their other CDs. The only thing is that Nick and SA don't have as much edge in their voice as some of their more recent CDs. It otherwise is golden.
5,"311 keeps it real with the album ""Grassroots""","Track back 311 from success in mainstream rock to their beginnings in Omaha, NB and you'll find ""Grassroots"" This album has all the hip-hop beats, hard chords, and rap-rock good enough to shame Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock. If you're a 311 fan this is a must have album."
5,I think this is the best 311 CD ever!,I like Grassroots the best. I think this is the best album that 311 put out.
3,311 - 'Grassroots' (Capricorn),"These Omaha natives return with their second CD.Keep in mind this was my first listen to the group.311 hit me like sort of a cross breed of,say The Beastie Boys and Red Hot Chili Peppers.Tunes I liked best were ""Lucky"",the hard-hitting ""Silver"",""Salsa"" and ""Six"".Still never got to see this act live as they often get booked in the medium to larger venues anymore when they tour.Might appeal to fans of Sugar Ray,Sublime and maybe Rage Against The Machine.A decent find."
4,311's ONLY great cd,"With The blue album, transistor, and soundsystem following grassroots, all i can ask is WHAT HAPPENED? Grassroots is pure and raw! Every track is has a different musical feel, and totally different style, unlike the last 3 studio albums, where every song has been at the same tempo, and had the same type of harmonized vocals. Grassroots throws in some excellent bass work by p-nut, as well as a mix of different vocal styles from song to song that is totally awesome!"
5,They do it again!,"Man-o-man, these guys are just too amazing. This is probably one of the best cd's of the 90's behind the likes of Nirvana's ""Nevermind"", Dr. Dre's ""Chronic"", and Rancids ""...and out come the wolves"" This is definatly a cd that you won't forget. I think the amazing thing about this cd is that is really didn't have all the hype or hits of the blue cd or transistor, but caried more solid songs than those two. From the hard guitar sounds of Homebrew, Lucky, Omaha Stylee, and Silver to the smooth sounds of 8:16 A.M and Taiyed. This is definatly a must have. Whether you recognize it or not, this cd revolutionized the sound of modern day music."
4,Great Metal-Funk Band Does It Again!,"Being very heavily into 311 and their many great albums, I would have to say this is NPCTD at their best! From the grooves of ""Homebrew"", and my favorite ""Lucky"", to the Latin feel of ""Salsa"" and ""Lose"", 311 delivers a strong followup to their '93 release, ""Music"". The album is much more rhythmic and melodic then the hard-core of ""Music"". So, I strongly recommend this album which was made with TRUE talent, unlike a lot of others that have been released this decade."
3,"Not that bad, but could have left some things out.","I recently baught and watched this movie. I had been trying to get it for years now, because I had heard some good reviews about it. I will start off by saying it does have some scary scenes in it, but they could have left some of the scenes out. The scene with the one guy who is playing a joke on his wife by sneeking up on her, and pretending to force himself on her. That served no purpose for the movie at all! Also, even worse, was the scene where the director in the movie has two women acting out a lesbian scene, that should have been left out for sure. It had nothing to do with the story at all! I guess like most movies they have to put some uncalled scenes involving sex. The movie would have been much better without those scenes. Now the good, it has 2 or 3 pretty creepy death scenes, especially the girl trying to get away towards the end. Also, the ending is nicely done. Overall I give it a 3 out of 5."
3,above average slasher film,"I don't really think of this film as being ""so much more"" than a 80's slasher movie, but I would definitely recommend it to more-than casual fans of the genre. although there is a decent story behind it that makes it a little more sophisticated than most, a great killers-disguise (a grotesquely realistic looking old hag's mask), as well as some good suprises, ""Curtains"" is a little too slow paced to be a great slasher film. Nonetheless, I'd say its a lot better than most critic's reviews would have you to believe, and a proper DVD release is definitely well-deserved."
3,canadian slasher melodrama,"After thumbing through some of my movie books I came across this universally panned horror film. After watching it I cant understand why all the negative reviews. This is by no means a classic horror film, but it is at times moody atmospheric and scary. Curtains suffers from being a little to talky at times, fortunatly the actors are all pretty good ( espeically samantha eggar). I can only think of what argento might have done with this story. That would have been something to see!"
3,IT'S CURTAINS ROCKY! CURTAINS!........oh! There adorable,Actresses up for the lead in director Vernon's new filmAudra are literally DYING for the part(sic)as a psycho ina old-hag mask(very effective mask)begins eliminating themone by one. Hampered by production(the producer fired the dir.and decided to direct the film himself?)this still manages to riseabove the average SLASHER! Great music score from Zaza alwaysa Big Plus in my book for Horror movies...MUSIC!
3,ANOTHER ELECTRONIC AMAZON MISTAKE,"THIS SCALE IS NUTS. THE BATTERY IS IMPOSSIBLE AT FIRST, THEN AFTER THAT U HAVE TO STEP ON THE SCALE 200 TIMES TIL IT READS AND IT BLINKS ERR, THEN GOES BACK AND FOURTH BETWEEN LIKE 40 LBS! THIS IS THE FOURTH PRODUCT FROM AMAZON THAT BROKE ON ME. I AM NO LONGER GOING BY PRICE AT AMAZON."
2,Not Very Accurate,Had this scale for almost 2 years and looking to replace it. It is accurate within +/- 10 pounds. Your guess is as good as mine.
1,I kick this thing every day,"What a piece of ****. I can't believe they even sell this as a viable product. It takes forever to calculate your weight and freaks out 2 out of 3 times with 'ERROR' ominously plastered over the display. My weight fluctuates by 20 pounds a day apparently, and the last time I tested with some doctors scales, it was understating my girth by 15 pounds. Avoid, avoid, avoid!God I'm fat."
1,Item stopped working 41 days after first use!!,"Sure its gorgeous, but I agree with ""This scale is nuts"" reviewer.First of all, it takes half a minute to give a read-out, many many ""err"" mis-reads, then this morning, it claims I am 102.5 pounds. (three times in a row) Oh, if only THAT were true! Okay, just now, it said 100 pounds, oh man I must be dying!! And YES I checked that the switch was on lbs and not kg.Spend more money and buy a GOOD scale!This is the second cheaper scale I bought, now I am getting a GOOD one.Oh yes, also, I did not spill water on it."
2,Very inaccurate,I don't understand how these products passed the quality test. The readings are very inaccurate and differs by more than 4 pounds even if the readings are just a minute apart.Do yourself a favor and never buy this item
1,Not a good scale,"I THOUGHT this scale was good for a while. It looked good. Then I started getting odd readings. Within five minutes, it would give me two different weights that are either 4 or 5 lbs apart. (I would do it over and over and the scale seemed to not be able to decide). I tried a new battery, and it did not help. (Before I noticed this problem, I actually told a friend to get this scale, too, and she has reported the same problem). I've tried moving the scale, resetting it, everthing. Nothing seems to help. I am now shopping for a new scale."
1,A Rip-Off At Any Price,This thing will give you five different measurements in a 15 minute time period. It will vary by plus or minus 15 lbs.
1,difficult to get a reading,"At least the item that I got is very slow (7~15 seconds) to report a weight reading.Very often, after the 7~15 seconds, it simply shows ""Err"" or ""Lo"". One has to step off the weight scacle and set on it again and weight another 7~15 seconds."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this scale about 5 months ago and would have given it an OK rating up until last week when it stopped working entirely. The platform is small and I found it hard to balance on; the display required overhead light and my glasses to read, but it seemed to give accurate readings. Then it stopped working, no readings at all. I'm looking for a better scale."
1,"scale is slow to process data, prone to error messages","I have never had a scale that takes so long to think about telling me what my weight is. Maybe it has a slower processor? It is also very prone to error messages- which means you can stand on the scale waiting while it thinks about telling you your weight, only to get an error message and have to go through the whole procss again.The other thing I have noticed about this scale is that it is more prone to error messages if you do not stand *very still*. It is difficult for my 80 year old mother to stand very still waiting for the scale to do its thing, so she gets a lot of error messages and is very frustrated with this scale.Not a recommended purchase."
3,Big Foot?,"My feet are only a women's 7 and I just fit on the scale. My boyfriends toes hang over the side. Love the scale, but they should have thought bigger when designing it."
4,THIS THING IS SMALLLLLLLLLLLLL,"Though the screen is large the actual scale is small... my hubby has size 11 feet and it is too small for him... I think it is giving an accurate weight, but I cannot be sure... I am about a size 6-6.5 and I feel like I barely fit... I am not sure if most scales are this way, but I didnt think to look up the size when I bought it so- FYI"
2,"It's ok, uses too much battery","The scale seems to be accurate. However, it sucks up too much battery. The battery that came with it was used up in 2 days and the battery I bought to replace it was used up with a month. I guess I'm stuck with it but I'm not buying another digital again."
1,Glass Bottom Broke Into Tiny Pieces,"We had this scale for about six months when I stepped on it one day and the black glass on the back of the scale shattered. I'm not the lightest person in the world, but not near the 300 pound capacity. It may be that the scale was on the grouting between the floor tiles, but this is unacceptable."
1,BAD,"the weight is very not accurate according to other good scales that i use, the change of weight every tine i go on it is different even if go on right after i go off."
1,Junk,"Bought this on a Friday Sale on Amazon, now I know why it was so cheap. This scale is a piece of garbage! The $5 dial scale I bought from K-mart worked better than this.When you step on the scale it takes like 5 minutes to get a readout, and then it will usually say Err. If you get a number, it is different almost every time. It once told me that I lost 10 pounds overnight!Please avoid this scale at all costs, and I mean all costs don't be charmed by a ""Friday Sale.""I'm going to Wal-Mart to get another $5 dial scale and throwing this worthless thing in the garbage."
5,Scale is very nice,We love this scale and the large easy to read printout. We haven't had any problems with it and it looks great in our bathroom.
1,Horrible accuracy,"Either I am too stupid to use this scale correctly or it is not accurate AT ALL! I have read some of the other reviews and it sounds like most people have found it to be an accurate scale so I must have gotten a dud. I weighed myself 5 times within 5 minutes after it gave inconsistent readings and I got 5 different weights.I guess it could be argued that it was being accurate because my whole foot doesn't even fit on the thing so I tried it with my toes hanging off, my heels hanging off, on one foot...every way I could think of to get two readings the same and none of it worked. It was a gift for my girlfriend and she has found the same fluctuations. Be forwarned, if you need a consistent accurate reading, you may want to shell out a little more money or stay away from this one."
1,Inaccurate & inconsistent,"The title says it all. Just bought it and went for my first reading. It seemed lower than I thought - so I stood on it again - completely different weight. So I stood on it again... Every time I stand on it, it gives me a different reading. What's the point of weighing yourself if the scale tells you a different weight every time you stand on it?"
1,Weight,"Worst product I have ever bought.The main purpose of this weighing scale is to tell me my exact weight and it shows me different weight every time i stand on it, even if the gad between my measurement is 10 mins. I just threw away my money..Please dont buy this product ever."
2,Scale died within a year.,"I understand that nothing (especially technology) lasts forever, but this scale had problems within 9 months of purchase. I thought it was the battery, so I bought a new battery for it. It seemed to work okay for a bit, then it started giving strange numbers, and now it constantly gives an error message.I don't expect it to last forever, but my last scale under $30 lasted eight years. I'd have liked to get at least a few years of use out of it. I wouldn't buy a Taylor again."
2,it was good while it lasted,"The scale is accurate and very easy to use. The problem is battery life. It's a battery monster. With new batteries, I was only able to weigh myself 3 times in 2 weeks. After that, I need new batteries. I store it very properly with nothing on top of it so I do not know why it eats up the battery so far. It's pretty useless"
3,Not accurate,"The scale is attractive in looks and style. However, it will not give you the same weight each time you step onto the scale.(weigh step off, step on again and weigh) It is also 1/2 pound off."
1,Innaccurate and deceptive!,"This scale is junk! For a while I thought my weight was fluctuating wildly everyday, then I started checking it with the old scale. It's way off! Then, most infuriating was when it said I weighed precisely the same with my clothes on as I did with them off -- to the tenth of a pound!!! I was looking at purchasing the ""Taylor 5599 440 Pound Tempered Glass Body Fat-Body Water Scale,"" which has excellent reviews, but I'm very hesitant to buy another thing from this company."
2,not accurate,if you dont mind your scale being off a few pounds every once in a while than this might be the scale for you. I was very unhappy with it because it was always off by a few pounds compared to the scale at my gym. Ended up just throwing it out.
2,Taylor 7000 Scale,I bought this couple of years ago and recently found out that it has a variance of about 2lbs and can't recalibrate. I recently bought a Tanita scale and it also doesn't have a recalibration capability but very accurate. I would g with Tantia.
1,"Weight can vary by up to 3 pounds; get ""ERR"" half the time","This cheap scale gives me a different reading by a pound or two or three if I just move it to a different spot on the floor.Even more annoying is about 25% of the time it can't get an accurate reading and just says ""ERR"" then I have to shake it and try again."
2,Not accurate,"Not accurate at all. Users were saying that they would get a reading, step out and step back on and get the same reading. That is because there's some sort of memory (probably saves it for a few seconds).I tried it by taking a reading, then taking another reading with a 1 lb book in my hands. It gave me the same reading as before.On the other hand, it's pretty cheap and it looks good."
4,I Found My Pounds!!,"The Taylor 7009 did a good job locating my pounds, now I just need to lose them. Nothing overly complicated, I step on it and it works. Good product..."
1,I Lost 2.5 lbs in 4 Seconds!,"This is the stupidest scale I've ever encountered. I've had it for over a year and I've always made sure to step on and off it at least until I can get two of the same readings in a row, but this morning I went from 128.5 to 126 twice in a row, so I stepped on again and got 128 and then I got 127. I give up.I'm getting a mechanical scale and this thing is going in the garbage."
1,It LIES!,This scale gives such varying read-outs that I must be eating 50Xs my weight one day and not eating at all the next. First you start with the error readings to clear the scale -- tap it -- 4 lbs -- tap it again - 3 lbs -- tap it again -- ah we're finally at 0 lbs. Time to actually stand on it. Oh look -- I gained 7 lbs since yesterday! Wow. Yeah it doesn't work well.
1,garbage,"i purchased this item, and everytime I got on the scale it gave me a different reading. It is very inaccurate, and do not recommend this item.After about 10 uses, it no longer has any power. I have not tried to replace battery, but even that was no good if that is even the problem.do not recommend. save your money and buy something better."
1,Stopped working entirely after 2 weeks,"I got the scale about 3 weeks ago and it doesn't work anymore. I haven't even used it much. The quality was as expected for the price paid, very flimsy and unstable and it took forever to give a reading. Would consistently require two- three attempts before it gave a reading, a very annoying experience. I am utterly disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Annoyed!,"I bought the scale about 5 months ago and I dont use it too often. Recently I've started marking my weight every week, and I am so annoyed!It varies in a 3 minute period between 2 or 3 pounds, which can get very discouraging.I got it from Brookstone where it came highly recommended. I wish I could return it."
2,It's okay....,"We have another digital scale in a different bathroom that seems to read much faster. Also, it only reads to .5 of a pound and now that I have it I wish it was more accurate. On a positive note it is cheap..."
3,Pretty darn good for the price!,"I love this scale. It's sleek, accurate, and lightweight but solid.The only problem I've found is that my size 10 feet don't fit on it so well, which makes it awkward when I weigh. :)"
1,works fine for a month or so - the GOES NUTS,"I just threw this scale away. We bought it about 8 months ago, it worked consistently for about 1-2 months, then started varying WILDLY. Yesterday, I got three readings, in 4 hours, that spanned 14.5 lbs. Somehow I doubt drinking one diet coke in an afternoon caused that kind of weight gain. It went in the trash last night."
2,Taylor 7009 Lithium Scale,Not worth it. Weight fluctuates daily 3-5 pounds. Accuracy is questionable.
1,Signs of digital imbalance ...,"According to this scale, my weight changes constantly. Within an hour my weight goes up or down by up to 2lbs. I'm sorry I didn't get to all the reviews before purchasing. Suffice it to say, I'm back to my analog scale - I suppose the next time I buy a scale, I won't be so cheap."
1,"Never consistent, don't waste your money!","I've owned this scale for about 2 years and wondered why I would get 3 different weights each time I weighed myself. I'd pick the middle one. It also weighs me 3-5 pounds less than at my doctor's office, and it is tiny! It's gotten worse the longer I've owned it. I'm reasearching other scales and see that there are problems with many, if not most, home scales. Maybe I'll just need to stop by my doctor's office when I'm interested in my weight. Or just gauge my weight by how I fit in my clothes."
1,Taylor 7009 Electronic Lithium Scale - Horrible,This scale gave a very different reading every time you stepped on it. Totally unreliable product.
4,NICE SCALE,This scale works just fine.Digital readout makes it easy to see your weight.Never had any problems with this scale.
1,Broken,"It did not weigh consistantly or accurately. I am returning it without replacing it because it also feels too flimsy, as if it breaks very easily."
2,dont buy this product,Not worth full product.The weight is not correct.the product is completly waste of money and time.dont buy this product.
4,"Good price, works fine","The scale is easy to use and gives consistent readings. The surface is not that large but on the plus side, it doesn't take up much space either. We have had no problems with it and it only varies by a pound or two for both members of the household. For the price, you can't beat it!"
3,"Great scale, until it fails","This scale performs exactly as described. We've had it about a year and it's used daily. So far, it's weighed perfectly every time. For the money, I couldn't ask for more.I'm happy I purchased this scale and would recommend it to anyone.UPDATE: This scale completely failed after about 3 years. Given longevity, reducing to 3 stars."
2,Not that accurate,Taylor doesn't say the accuracy. After working out for a week and seeing no weight lose I tried an experiment. Take a large full glass of water and weigh yourself with it. Dump out a little bit. Weigh again and repeat till you see a weight difference. My scale is .6I was looking for a scale with .1 accuracy and this isn't it. I wish Taylor was up front with the specs.
2,Preachy and Whiny,"In ""High Tide,"" Kingsolver uses her position as an author to relentlessly promote her political views, religious views, any kind of view that anyone might have. A truly great author presents the information and allows the reader to draw their own conclusions. Not only does ""High Tide"" NOT allow us to draw our own conclusions, but it lacks the fresh prose of ""The Poisonwood Bible."" Thumbs down to a potentially great author who is biased, mis-informed, and forceful in her personal beliefs."
5,"EXCITING, ENTERTAINING ESSAYS","This is my first book with Barbara, but it won't be my last. This is a very talented writer with a strong command of vocabulary, and when she talks about the desert coming alive, or the pigs eating her flower and plants, it's like taking a photograph and placing you right in the scene. Her essay called ""The Muscle Mystique"" was one of the best I've ever read about the gym experience - fun and thought-provoking. One of the great lines, ""My inspiration down at the health club was a woman firefighter who could have knocked down my garden gate with a karate chop...""; and there's plenty more just as descriptive."
4,Not to many walks South Jersey,"The descriptions, stories, directions are good and interesting. However, I live in South Jersey and hoped there would be more places that I didn't have to drive so far to get to."
2,The X factor,"You can't help but make comparisons to X, and that's the problem. The album almost sounds like Doe playing all the songs that didn't make it on an X album. You can't blame a guy for trying, but this album falls short."
2,Buy an X album instead.,"John Doe is a talented guy, but he has taken a major step down ever since he started going solo. This stuff pretty much blows compared to X's greatest achievements. John-Boy's lost his Midas Touch."
5,ALONG THE WAY,BEST BOOK ON THE MARKET. IT MOTIVATES PEOPLE TO NEVER GIVE UP DESPITE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS. HOLD ON TO HOPE AND IN THE END IT WILL BE REWARDED. THIS IS A MUST READ.
4,Home theater Receiver,A great unit for the price and it syncs well with my Pansonic Plasma and Pansonic DVD/VHS combo recorder/Player. The bummer is the surround portion pooped out about a month ago. ( I'll have to check into that. Maybe substitute some other speakers) I'm using any old speakers from previous failed equipment and it still sounds good ( of course I'm deaf as a stone but maybe Sara Palin can hear it from her house. After all that's all that counts right?? Hope her remote control's signal won't reach my place cause I gave up watching cartoons when I was six.
4,utility receiver,"since i already have a sa-xr55, i knew what i was getting into when i bought the sa-xr57. the 57 looks better than the 55. beyond that the only main difference is the hdmi interface in the 57. but given its limited video sampling capabilities i find that hooking my dvd player directly to my sony lcd tv (which has better video sampling capabilities) gives me a clearer picture with hdmi. for audio i hook a coax cable from the dvd player to the receiver. at low volumes it is not that great. but at good volumes the audio is pretty good. i use the b&w 6 series speakers and a pinnacle baby sub for my home theater setup. i also have a nad 325 bee cd player hooked into the receiver with another coax. for the money this receiver is a great deal."
5,"""El Dorado"" is an American original...","What can I say about this record that hasn't already been written? Mike Metz has produced a work of genuine originality and ebullient personality that defies a neat categorization as rock, blues, R&B, or even ""Americana"". Metz's vocals, reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen at his best, are nonetheless unique and captivating. Surrounding himself with a group of stellar musicians, Metz delivers a compelling contemporary blend of acoustic and slide guitars, sax, fiddle, accordion, and trumpets - aided by some truly amazing back-up vocalists, including The Gospel Hummingbirds. The band's deceptively straightforward style inexplicably reveals some previously overlooked (by me) nuance of harmony, vocal inflection or musical detail with each subsequent listen. All in all, a 100% honest, hard-core pastiche of American musical styles executed in an infectious manner that cries out for ""mainstream"" radio airplay. Very highly recommended."
5,"Africa's Sinatra! - this really is ""the album of his life""","For the first time (at least insofar as his international releases are concerned), Youssou N'Dour appears to have assembled traditional Senegalese musicians on balafon, kora, xalam, wooden flute and other acoustic instruments, combining their support with the chattering guitars and the talking-drum and sabar percussion of his usual high-energy ""Super Etoile"" band in surprising ways. This is all a winning backdrop for one of the world's - not just Africa's - greatest voices. Running through it all, N'Dour's melodies in this album are among the most supple and affecting of his career. We have with this record a more intimate portrait than ever before of a world-class singer (Christgau says he's the world's best pop singer of all!) who is gracefully assuming a mantle of maturity. This album is brilliant."
3,Great Production - Missing some heart,"Generally I love Youssou N'Dour's music, and seeing him live is a magnificent experience. When I got this CD, I was really excited, as the acoustic production was truly brilliant. Gone are the cheesy keyboards and drum machines. The problem is that the infectious songs that you sing over and over in your head are also gone. There are no classics on this CD like ""Birima"" (originally on the Senagalese release LII!, then later on JOKO). Still, this isn't a 'bad' CD, it just isn't Youssou's best. If you don't own any Youssou N'Dour CDs, I'd buy IMMIGRES and JOKO first. If you are a true Youssou fan, then you'll still like this CD (but probably won't 'love' it)."
2,A disappointment,"N'Dour has one of the most beautiful voices in the world, and his band is of stellar quality. Why then does he insult his fans by tossing inappropriate and out of place synth washes and drum machines into the mix? A note to Youssou: Give us some credit! We can handle--and in fact crave--a CD showing the full glory of your african roots. No ""Westernization"" required. If you're expecting this disc to be the ""real deal"", you will share my disappointment."
2,a lost of time,"What a surprise ! Lots of machines, synths, drums, sampler... where are his african roots ?Too commercial. Soapy message...I'm not African but I'm not stupid, he can do better.A fan from Paris (France)"
5,Buy it,"You 1911 enthusiasts, buy it. you will be greatly impressed. No adjustment needed! Own several of these, take them out of the package, slip them in your waist band, insert pistol, forget it till you need it! Like carrying your wallet"
1,Buy if you like cleaning up spills,This is 100% junk. The top is incredibly easy to pop off. Squeezing the container with your hands is enough to pop the the cap off. Thanks to this well designed container I am having to clean out my lunch container for the second time because the lid popped off and ruined my lunch. If you like wasting food and time this is a great buy!!!!
2,not good if you plan to freeze them,These suck if you intend to freeze them. I have had 2 crack so far in the fridge after taking out of the freezer. If you dont plan to freeze should work well.
2,5 spills so far...,"I use this container for my son's milk to bring to daycare. It is a good size for that purpose, but the problem I have with it is the lid cover pops off very easily, and has caused several spills. I'm shopping on Amazon now for a different container because of this problem."
3,item is without lid,"The container looks durable and high quality. Intend to use it for food grains or the like.However it comes without the lid - so the photo (for 22 quart version) is misleading. Also, the suggested lid under ""frequently bough together"" shown on amazon has ""6-8 quart lid"" in its title - I am not sure if thats the right lid for this container. There is no clear description of which lid is compatible with what container. It seems the actual lid will be the product Rubbermaid Commercial Products FG573000YEL 12- 18- 22-Quart LidRubbermaid Commercial Products FG573000YEL 12- 18- 22-Quart Lidwhich is not suggested automatically on Amazon. Have ordered that - will update this review if that turns out to be incompatible.Also, the container has slots for attaching a handle like a paint bucket. Wish the handle was also suggested automatically by Amazon to purchase together. But not having the handle is no big deal for my purpose."
1,"Same category of ""Protocls of the Elders of Zion""","This work is the same sort as the notorious antisemtic forgery, ""The Protocls of the Elders of Zion"". Shahak simply invented anecdotes and laws of Jewish hostility to Jews. His story of Jewish rabbis ignoring the deaths of non-Jews is a lie, his account of Orthodox Jews poisoning non-Orthodox Jews is a lie on the order of the old ""blood-libel"". You can see this pointed out at http://www.wernercohn.com/Shahak.html ."
1,Let down,"It was not as pictured, or more specifically, it was strap in the top of the picture, not the bottom picture, which is the one I wanted"
1,ICK AND UGH,"I am sorry to report that this book is awful. It is either condescending, or it is meant for elementary students. It was for a college-level arhcitecure study. There are no pictures, only drawings. I despised it."
2,Not the TIME to peel,"At the beginning this watch was the best Timex I have had in a long time. It does keep time, the buckle assembly is great and the number are nice and big ,BUT, After about 2 weeks of wearing it everyday, the design on the band began to peel off . It went from black and grey swirly to solid black, to black and cream. It looks like crap, but it still works good. It make a good work watch, but thats about it."
3,"Know that they have always been ""down down"".","Ahh, remember when 311 was the new Chili Peppers? Well I don't think that quite happened, but I still like them both. There's no doubt that this is a good album, and their big break-through to the masses, but front to back I like others of theirs more. This does however include numerous good songs, and the hits ""Down"", ""All Mixed Up"", and ""Don't Stay Home"". Besides directing a newcomer to the ""Greatest Hits"", I'd also suggest ""Soundsystem"", ""Transistor"", and the excellent debut ""Music"". This album is still pretty ""Sweet"" though, and I like the alien related packaging."
5,it's good morning music,"I'd just like to say that this album is a mix of the b-boys and rage. I think that they also bring their own flavor into it. It's rare when you find a cd that you can listen to the whole way through. So if you haven't gotten the album by now, don't you think it's about time."
2,Average C.D.,"First of all, anybody who thinks this c.d. is hardcore, it must be the first c.d. they've ever listened to. Second, why do so many people think they are cool if they like 311, they just try to be trendy and think their stylish."
1,Frat Boy Fun,"As if I have to put up with enough grief living here in Nebraska, I now have to deal with 311. Once upon a time, 311 was a pretty good band. Now they are just pathetic. They deserve a score less than one star. The fan base of 311 has fallen to the level of frat boys and 13 year old girls. Hope they can sleep at night knowing that their skater punk, X-treme games audience is growing up fast. If any of the members of 311 happen to read this review, I would offer a piece of advice. Don't steal from Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Beastie Boys or Rage Against the Machine any more 'cause the sound is wearing thin. Two, get in touch with a job service soon. Your time in the music spotlight is running out fast."
4,311'S BEST CD TO DATE,"I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE, IF YOU'RE A REAL 311 FAN, YOU MUST AT LEAST HAVE THIS CD! SURE, THE SONGS AREN'T AS LONG AS ONE WOULD PROBABLY LIKE IT TO BE, BUT THEY'RE STILL SOME OF THE FUNKIEST SONGS I'VE EVER HEARD. BETWEEN THE FUNKY GUITAR RIFFS AND HEXUM'S INTENSE RAPPING, THIS CD IS NOT TO BE MISSED. ''ALL MIXED UP'', ''GUNS ARE FOR P***IES'', ''PURPOSE'', ''HIVE'', AND ''JACKOLANTERN'S WEATHER'' ARE SOME OF THE BEST ROCK SONGS FROM THE 90S. I GAURANTEE EVERY FAN OF RAP OR ROCK WILL ENJOY THIS ALBUM. THIS BEATS LIMP BIZKIT."
3,311's first step on a downward spiral,"this was their commercial breakthrough album, but it doesn't hold a candle to their GOOD albums (music and grassroots). all mixed up... down... etc... nothing special when heard next to ""omaha stylee"", ""lucky"", ""homebrew""...this was 311's first indication of their going in the unfortunate direction that led them to make ""transistor"", which was watered down and awful. glad they were able to cash in, but their music definitely suffered after grassroots."
4,pretty good cd,"I got this cd because I was a fan since 311 first started out.Too many people started out with this cd.When this came out,it was such a departure from what I was used to it too a little to get used to it,but I still like it."
3,Fakest album they've done,"This cd really deserves more than I gave it but I get sick of people saying this is their best work. Being the album that blew them straight into mainstream automatically makes it suspicious, but the fact is that its only ok. All mixed up was a great single that made up for down which was good to listen to once at the most. Then songs like DLMD totally ruin it. While SA is good at his rap riffs this band is ultimatley a reggae,alternative group and anything that strays from that is bound to suck. You want to hear their good stuff get Evolver, Transistor, and Grassroots. Peace"
2,doesnt do it for me,"311. I have never been partial to them. I don't really like how they mix up the reggae stuff with their instruments; it just doesn't work for me. That's the root of my beef with 311. If you've heard any of their stuff, and you didn't like it, you probably shouldn't get this CD. If you did like it, go ahead and buy it much of their music is in the same style."
1,311... Just as I expected,I had heard how great 311 is from a lot of my friends and i was expecting some good music. THEY THINK THEY CAN RAP!!! hahaha that is some bad rap rock.... I you want some good rap rock (metal) check out Deftones Adrenaline... Deftones slaughter 311 in every aspect. I thought this album was going to be intense... again get Deftones Adrenaline and see how you like 311 now... DO NOT BUY THIS CD or any 311 cds
5,best one,This is 311's best cd they have put out. Every song on the cd is really good. Usually some cd's have a couple bad songs but this one doesn't.
3,"It's not that great, but it's not that bad either.","I really like some of the songs, but some others are really bad. I wouldn't spend money and buy this CD...use that money to buy something better!"
3,An original album lacking in a few areas,"The minute you hear this CD, you immediatly hear 3 different musical genres - Rock, Rap and funk. 311 stake their claim with hits like ""Down"", ""All Mixed Up"", and ""Hive."" ""Down"" is a fast and furious tune with a great guitar hook layered throughout. ""All Mixed Up"" has a slower tempo but is the best produced song on the album. ""Hive"" is a good rap/rock song that could put the likes of Limp Bizkit and Korn to shame. The best part of the song is the chorus - similarities with the Beastie Boys comes to mind. The rest of the album more or less sounds like one of the above mentioned songs. It's still a descent album, however, because of the originality that 311 pocessess. If you are a 311 fan, this is an essential. If you are just getting into the band, try ""Grassroots"" first - arguably their best album."
5,311,This CD is one of the best that ive heard in a while.You can listen to the whole CD without skipping tracks.Its great.Buy This great CD.
5,a huge 311 fan's review on the self titled album,"311 was just a great all around c.d. with funky tunes some of my favs from this one are don't stay home, down, jackolantern's weather, and random this c.d. is definetly worth the money just like every 311 c.d"
4,No wonder this album made them mainstream!!,"This is definatly the reason 311 has left the underground scene and advanced to mainstream. I've hed this album since the day it was released and was suprised it took MTV more than a year later to realize ""hey, this is awesome music, let's play it!"" Everything is to be loved about this album. The perfect blends of hardrock and rap. And who doesn't love the reggae, punk, rap sounds comin from ""All Mixed Up""? The only thing they lacked was SA's use of the turntable. I only hear it in ""Down"" and at the begining of ""All Mixed Up"". So buy it, you'll see why this album went triple platinum."
3,Not the best 311 cd....but ok.,"Okay, this is pure 311 without a doubt but its not the best stuff they've done. The cd itself is alright, with tracks like ""Random"" and ""Down"", but I would definetly recommend Grassroots, Music, or Omaha Sessions if you really like this cd."
4,This is Damn Good,I enjoy the ska scattin and rappin of S.A. Martinez and the slappin bass of P-nut.It's all good for those that are 311 fans like i am.You DOWN?
5,A Fun And Light Hearted Romp,"311 never really gets too serious, they keep it light, which can be perfect for some moods. Some of their lyrics are even playful. If you are into this style of music, maybe 311 is for you."
5,Amazing combination of styles,"I got this cd a few years back when i was real down on the music that was comin out, and i only liked a few songs that were on it. Then i dug it out my close a few weeks ago and I was amazed. The music and lyrics are astonishing. I'm not real into rock, but 311 goes beyond all genres of music. They are unique and 1 of a kind. Anyone that enjoys reggae, rap, hip-hop, or rock should have this cd."
3,"You love it, Then it drags on","This is a very good album... if the whole album were one song. What begins to get old after awhile on this album is what the album is made up of. IT's original, and creative, but all that originality kinda gets intertwined in every song. How original can something be if you use that originality over and over? IT no longer makes it original, but instead very repetitive and boring. Nearly every rap is done the same way, and every song has a very similar feel in the way it is strucured. Rap verse with a riff done over and over, and then a breakout into the chorus. One time i shuffeled the c.d. and when the second song came on i thought it was the last song. IT's kinda weird. The reggae songs do break out from the ordinary, but the album is missing alot. So overall, start the album anywhere and you'll be hearing the same thing."
5,hi yo king,blue is the best album the other ones. just arent that goode. like me rough and get this cd next year
4,Great Entertainment,"The Return of the Musketeers is the fourth remake of the Alexandre Dumas novel ""The Twenty Years After.(A Russian and Italian version stayed closer to the original novel Milady had a son Mordaunt nee John Francis de Winter.The French made a 1955 version which like this version changed Milady's son into a daughter.This is a great follow-up to The Three and Four Musketeers.Being that Faye Dunaway was killed off in the Four Musketeers.Kim Cattrall is excellent as a foil for the Musketeers as Milady and Rochefort's illegitimate daughter after the Four Musketeers for having her mother executed (rightfully,so.).The acting,sets and costumery are great.It's a shame that Oliver Reed and Roy Kinnear are now deceased they could have been back for a fourth film based on the Musketeers final years-The Man in the Iron Mask.A great trilogy if there ever was one.At least the Russians filmed the 3 works."
4,"A swashbuckling good time, monsieur.","This is an entertaining sequel to the two musketeers films of the '70s. Not as good as the first one (hard to top), but still fun and the cast still looks great. Does Michael York ever age? Could Oliver Reed be any cooler? The assault on the castle (via hot air balloon) toward the end of the film is the highlight. The music accompanies the film well and the main theme is thrilling. If you liked the first two, you might want to pony up the dough and buy this one."
4,The old formula still works.,"WHile not on the same level as the first two Musketeer movies made by Richard Lester, the Return of the Musketeers is still a great movie. Nearly all the original cast are together again and the magic is still there. This sort of comedy/swashbuckler seems to have been forgotten a bit nowadays ( The Mark of Zoro has some of the ingredients, but leans more to the adventure side ) Somewhat loosely based on Dumas' The Musketeers: Twenty years later, the Return of the Musketeers sports a female swordslinger in Lady the Winter's daughter, who's lust for revenge brings the four Musketeers together again. They should be greatful! It even leaves the suggestion of a sequel, since the villainess escapes in the end, but no further movies were made. On the whole: a movie that is fun to watch, just don't take it seriously."
2,Lame and embarrassing third sequel to two great movies,"The first two entries in this series, the 1970's ""Three Musketeers"" and ""Four Musketeers,"" were probably the best movie versions of Dumas that will ever be made. This third segment has all the right elements -- same cast, same director, same script writer. But the story never comes alive. A few short sequences have the old magic -- especially Oliver Reed's reaction to the execution of Charles I -- but mostly it flails around in a series of pointless stunts and fat jokes. Aramis' defection from the team has no emotional impact -- compare it to D'Artagnan changing sides in ""The Man in the Iron Mask."" It's obviously just something they did because they couldn't afford Richard Chamberlain for as many shooting days as the other actors. Skip this movie, and re-watch the other ones in the same series instead."
3,Typical Sequel-Sequel Syndrome,"It was good to see the 'boys' in action again. The 'twist' of Athos and Arimis not trusting d'Artagnan was good. Otherwise, most of it was boring. I loved the 3 and 4 Musketeers, the 3 being my favorite."
4,Short but Sweet,If you're a fan boy of this neo-classic and don't have a lot of time to play a long game than this shooter is for you! 20% driving missions. Worth the small price.
2,Okay if you like drum machines,"I found the plinks and plonks of the drum machine (courtesy of Lol Hammond I guess) on most of the tracks really off putting in this album. I particularly don't like fake wooden sticks and hand claps. A personal dislike granted and in my view very 80's not late 90's. Enough to make me avoid playing it very often. Perhaps my loss but give me the likes of ""Lost in Translation"", ""Between Tides"", ""Swimming"" or the more recent ""The Night Garden"" any day. Other than that musically it's as moody as any of Roger's other albums (most of which I'd rate 4+)."
4,Wonderful!,"Eno's manifold machinations on this album are refreshing. I have rather enjoyed his amalgamation of drums, piano, and spirited uplifts. It's a shame this artist isn't as revered as others in the New Age genre. I prefer Roger Eno to standouts such as Steve Roach."
5,If you own a digital camera you gotta have one,"I have mine at my office, and EVERYONE who sees it on my desk wants one. Picture clarity is fantastic. Transitions between pictures are fun. I take tons of digital pictures, and this is a terrific way to get to see them. I have a 1 gig card in mine and everytime I look I see a different picture.You'll need some kind of memory stick (not included) and a way to load pictures on it. Most of this I had lying around, but if you don't figure $50-75 for a card and $20-30 for a card reader. In my estimation, WORTH EVERY PENNY. I just bought my wife one and everyone where she works wants one now too. A fantastic way to get your moneys worth from your digital camera."
2,Not very Helpful,I was somewhat disappointed as only about one thrird of this little book is Information about trains. The other part is a general travelguide.Only VIA Rail services and the Rocky Mountainer are covered. Trains like the Polar Bear Express aren't even mentioned.Then I had to find that some information is out of date (VIA-Rail DOES serve Quebec City).If you want a Canada travel guide rather buy a Lonely Planet and if you want additional information about rail travel you can find it on the internet.
4,Good basic guide book.,Book has lots of good basic info on trin travel in western Canada. Recommendation to buy came from ViaCanada. Well worth the purchase price.
2,Not very useful,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. Only one third of it is actual information about train-travel. Most of it is a general travelguide with informations about the cities etc.The train information covers only VIA-Rail services, doesn't even mention trains like the Polar Bear Express.Then I found that some of the information about trains was even out of date (Quebec City IS served by VIA Rail).If you want a Canada travel guide with detailed information about the country rather buy the Lonely Planet. If you want more info on trains in Canada I'd suggest looking on for websites."
5,Exciting boys adventure,"Gallant squires and their knights journey home from the Third Crusade. Tournaments, sea battles, street fights and a cameo by evil Prince John. It's a wonderful listen for the ride to school with lots of period detail. My son had to struggle between listening and asking questions about the history. Somewhere Sir Walter Scott is nodding with approval."
3,Good resources but just okay......,"This really is the ""topic du jour"" and it clearly is an important one, but like some of the other readers I found Schneier's book (Secrets & Lies) to be much more informative, both for senior managers and those involved in the day-to-day issues. For most of the book I got the feeling I was being lectured by a security guard explaining a lot of the concepts, and I found some of the fiscal impact figures to be sketchy at best. I think the proof of this is the readjustment of the demonstrable financial impact when persuing court cases - these numbers tend to be a fraction of those presented within the text.If one knows nothing on the subject and wants to hear ""the inside scoop"" on a number of news stories, it is an okay start. To my mind, the best part of the book were the appendices and the references to other resources throughout the book - those other resources are a lot more valuable than the text in the book itself."
3,Nothing New Here - Just FUD,"FUD is known in the hacker world as ""Fear, Uncertainty and Doom"" - mostly it's used to refer to media reports on any hacker exploit. You've read the articles - some newbie hacker scripts his way into a server and the report just about gaurantees you that the next step is going to be a premature firing of nuclear weapons. Well, this book does little to quell that line of thinking. It's an interesting collection of stories, but little else. It plays too much on general mis-information and that's never good. I give it three stars only because it's got a lot of ""history"" in it regarding hacks and exploits...be warned though - the FUD is heavy and thick. Best Regards, turtlex."
5,Freedom should be NORML but..,"I rate this 5 on two main reasons: the altruism and the music. The first is an obvious one, raise funds for Norml, it is not ok that people serve prison times for just a joint. The second one is less obvious because you have to listen to it and will find one of the best compilations ever. Most of the tunes are covers: Black Crowes doing Bob Dylan's ""Rainy Days Women #12&35"" sound even better than the Blonde on Blonde original version. Check Blues Traveler doing Sly Stone's ""I wanna take you higher"" great harmonica blowing will take you as high as the Woodstock version. Enjoyed a lot the Widespread Panic version of Van Morrison's ""An it Stoned Me"", Black Sabbath's ""Sweet Leaf"" by Sacred Reich (woulda been better with a stronger initial cough) and so.The rest of the album is ""high"" level music, 311, Cypress Hill, Gov't Mule. Definitely a must, and if this item appears out of stock here, look for it on another on line store or get it second hand."
3,They've got the herb.,311 and other quality groups sing about their very favorite thing. I think you can guess what it is.
1,You get what you pay for. (Less than $3),"There are very few decent tracks on this CD, the best of which is performed by Cypress Hill. The songs on this CD are about marijuana, which is fine, but they go about it in an all too obvious way. I was looking for a scalpel, and this CD is a rusty machete."
1,unstable,"This tool is a joke. I returned it the same day I received it. The hokey plastic connector is wobbly and ill concieved. Use one of the third hand extension poles (also made by fastcap) with the laser mount for 1/5th the price and better performance. Monsterously oversized blowmold case weighs more than the tool. This is one sad device, and would make its owner the butt of every ""limp pole"" joke imaginable. Look for this to be redesigned SOON!"
3,Acceptable,"It seems like this tool will be a benefit. I think the blow molded kit box may be a little annoying due to its large size, however I'm not sure I have a better suggestion for carrying the tool. I haven't had the tool for long so the ""jury is still out."""
3,leaves grease stains on lid!,"It is a beautiful butter dish but the inside rim of the lid is not covered in the clear enamel gloss, meaning that if the lid touches the butter, it soaks into the exposed ceramic and leaves a grease stain. I bought mine at a Mikasa outlet store and was able to exchange it for a new one. I haven't used the new one yet because I am waiting until I can find some sort of ceramic sealant so this doesn't happen again!"
4,Worked for a novice,"I've never re-caulked a shower before, so I was a little concerned. This product made it easier than I expected. Be aware though - it is only for latex caulk, not silicon.I put on gloves and glasses (just to be extra safe) and squeezed a toothpaste size bead all along the floor edge and part way up the corners. Then I left it to work while I went to the grocery and had lunch. After 2-3 hours I scraped most of it away with little effort. In a few places I had to poke and push. A scrub brush and water took off the rest."
1,Didn't work,I used this product to try to remove some caulk I got on some vinyl siding. It did not work. Maybe not the right product to use for this.
1,Unreadable,"Warning: the positive reviews here are almost certainly written by economists who have intimate understanding of the material. Either there was no editor or the editor didn't care, but Meyer rambles on aimlessly and then makes concrete statements that suggest that his mind was thinking things he neglected to explain or commit to print. While there may be valuable history here, he should not have attempted to have written it himself without the aid of a ghost writer or editor."
1,Arrived broken,This set of 6 arrived broken and had to be sent back. It was very poorly packed. I was very disappointed and found some elsewhere.
2,Doesn't add much to the debate,"Krivit spends most of his time quoting Beaudette (see ""Excess Heat: Why Cold Fusion Research Prevailed"") or Jed Rothwell.Better to read their stuff directly. Don't waste your money."
2,"Cold Fusion (LENR) is real, this book is a modest intro","This book is a modest intro. If you want better and easier, go to Youtube and query LENR. Then visit the LENR web site. There are many resources better at this point."
4,Great for older kids,My 6 year old daughter loves Big Time Rush and these dvds are entertaining for people of all ages. I definitely recommend for older children or preteens!
5,Child Loves This,My child loves Big Time Rush and it is great to have the first episodes in the DVD library for viewing whenever we want.
5,thanks,"Thanks you so much!5 stars cuz I love it,once again thanks :)Love this movie/show :)Thanks :)"
2,No widescreen!!!,I have watched this show in widescreen on satellite. Why buy a DVD with half the picture missing??? This does not make sense! Offer a widescreen DVD or Blu and then I'll buy! The show in widescreen gets 5 stars.
1,Broke,I recieved this item along with volume 2. When I took it out of amazon box I heard the movement inside the case. All the DVD prongs that hold it in place were broken and my DVD was just lose being shaken up. Of course now there are scratches all over the DVD. I was not pleased with that at all
5,well worth watching and owning,I have watched these movies more times than I can count. I never grow tired of the stories. Olympia Dukakis (as well as the entire cast) is/are amazing. If you have never seen this RUN to your video store and rent them....better yet....just buy them cause you'll watch them more than once.
3,Happy child,"My grandson was was happy with this spiderman helmet and pads, and they are pretty easy to get on. The outside was really nice but I guess I expected a little too much quality for the price I paid. It will keep him from getting hurt but was expecting a little more somehow. Not really disappointed, but not overjoyed with it either."
4,Good value,I bought two sets to give as gifts to four year olds. The price was right and they look good. Since I will be donating them to an anonymous child I will not be able to comment further.
3,Helmet great - elbow/knee pads disappointing,"I purchased this set for my grandson (4). The helmet is great. However, the elbow and knee pads are too small and not very well made. They should have made them just a little bigger, and add more length to the straps. These made horrible red marks on the back of his elbows and especially his legs. That part of the package was not worth the price."
2,Looks cute not sturdy,"The set looks great and goes nicely with the spiderman skates. The helmet fits well and looks safe; however, the knee and elbow pads are somewhat flimsy and they are almost too small for my recently turned 3 year old who is average sized."
5,spiderman helment with knee and elbow pads,Great price! Cheaper to buy on amazon than in Walmart. My son loved it and mom and dad were glad to not have to spend to much money. :)
3,Helmet and Pads,Of course we want our grandson to be safe while he is riding his Spider-Man bike. What better way to ensure that than with Spider-Man helmet and pads.
4,Spidey Helmet and Pads Combo,The Spiderman Child Helmet and Pads Combo was promptly shipped and arrived on time. I was pleasantly surprised to find the pads combo included knee pads AND elbow pads - great bargain. The helmet and pads fit my 3 year old grandson and he loves them!
4,Perfect for my Spiderman Fan,Perfect fit for my son's head. He likes to just wear it around the house because it has Spiderman on it. It is a fun product that I don't mind him wearing as it protects his head just as it is supposed to. He loves it!
1,Don't buy,"Our young kids kept playing with the real tape measure, so we thought we'd get them their own. It might be safer for them to use, but no one plays with it because when you pull out the tape it stays all curled up and so they can't measure anything."
5,Good Measuring Tape,"My son saw this measuring tape in a magazine, and it was the only thing he asked Santa for. He was thrilled and loves playing with it. The big handle makes it easy for him to roll the tape back up."
1,Piece of junk,"The tape broke the second day of use. It just broke off at around the 6"" mark and the rest wound itself inside. Returned it for refund."
3,Not a substitute for the real thing,"My son, who is two years old, loves real tools. I bought him this tape measure for him for Christmas. He played with it for about ten minutes before he wanted the real tape measure that I had put out of his reach. The product is not really like an actual tape measure. I also don't like how the numbers begin on one end of the tape measure and then the rest continues on the actual tape. It is difficult to follow for a two year old."
3,"Okay toy, but not something to play with for hours on end","This is a big tape measure, they weren't joking!! Big tape measures are used in construction, so it's not necessarily unrealistic. It's just big! My son was all excited about this when it first arrived. My 2 year old and 7 year old were fighting over it! It's not a toy that gets played with a lot, but it sure is handy when we are doing projects and we want the little one to keep away from our real tape measure (they cut so easily...)."
3,well...,"i thought i ordered a red one, then my email said i ordered a blue one. okay i made a mistake, no big deal. I open my package and its a yellow one. =/nothing wrong with the toy and im sure my child will use the hell out of it, its just weird i didnt get what i thought i was supposed to get, twice."
2,Do not last very long,I purchased a pair of these covers in November 2011 and in September 2012 - they were both cracking and peeling apart. Not even one year worth of coverage....sad these days that things last so little time.
4,Milescraft 1207 Router Design Inlay Kit,"The inlay kit is just as described. The templates and guides are plastic but adequate for occassional use. It is a great starter set to see if you really want to get into inlay. The router bits seem to perform well, just do not force them too much or they will break."
2,poor customer service,"this is fine for larger pieces of wood, but there is no way of determining center lines for smaller pieces as the inlay templates are all offset. (ie. to use the heart inlay) 1st response from customer service assumed I was an idiot and told me I needed to take the box lid off the box first (duh!!) never recieved a reply from them when I Clarified my original question.By the time you are done making the elaborate fixturing they recommend, you may as well just make your own templates and use the Whiteside inlay kit, as it is faster and you give yourself many more options.product is a good idea but poorly executed.Customer service is piss poor at best."
2,Two Time Loser,"I bought this item twice. About two years between purchases. Each time I couldn't get it to work. I wanted it to work, and the video on the website makes it look easy, but I just couldn't get the hang of it."
5,Awsome product,Great kit it's easy to use I would recomend this product to any one interested in doing inlays or designs.
5,Mandy Madness,Great! Great! Loved every single minute of it! Perfect song selection and so many of them flow into the next with no breaks in between. Mandy is an amazing talent. Highly recommended for every Sondheim fan.
2,Adequate performance; poor entertainment,"I received this disc the same day a ""Philip Quast Live at the Donmar"". The Quast disc has its own flaws (and I dont wish to compare the two performers) but it has been strung together in a more thoughtful manner, with witty imagination and using a more dangerous in the choice of songs, which is really where this disc fails. The songs here are generally enjoyable though rather standard, and the lack of cohesion (running the songs together doesnt count) means I just dip into the discs listening to a few favourites, rather than enjoying the whole show."
5,Wish I could have been at this concert!,"Imagine singing your heart out for almost 2 hours with only an upright piano for accompaniment and a few well-deserved breaks for thunderous applause. This is the back drop for Mandy Patinkin's love letter to Sondheim. Several of the songs have been recorded previously by Patinkin (Lesson #8; When?; Someone Is Waiting; Finishing the Hat; If You Can Find Me, I'm Here; Beautiful; Sunday...), but not as simply and beautifully as this. Patinkin is at his animated and artistic best in front of a live audience. Wish I could have been at this concert, but I am happily content with this masterful 2-disc CD."
3,Not something to buy online,Something I realized after ordering these boots was that you really need to take into account how big your calves and everything are. I don't believe these would fit very many people but maybe I am wrong. They are cheap (as they are meant to be because they are costume boots) so don't intend on wearing them too many times.
2,Sizing is not correct,"I ordered the red patent leather ones, and when they came I was susprised at how LARGE the calf was for a 9 B(m) the tounge would not even stay up and they felt like they were actually size 11's. Something is not right with these boots, either they are actually EE and not b, or something is wrong"
2,"cute, but...","I am quite disappointed with this phone, having had it about a month. I do not want much in a cell phone, just that it allow me to call people and them to call me. A camera I might play around with when bored. So far, this phone has completely turned off for no reason several times while in the middle of a call (the battery was not low), it takes a long time for the screen to appear when you open the phone, it has not allowed me to send pictures consistently (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't). Your voicemail does not tell you date and time of messages, and erases even saved messages after a couple of days, text and voicemail. Sometimes I like to save voicemails for longer than that. Overall, I will be trying to get the screen thing repaired, though I'm dreading dealing with the cingular store (haven't heard good things), but I'm just wishing I had stuck with my old phone."
2,I hate this phone,"I bought 2 Razr V3 pink phones for my family plan of 4. I was very unhappy with the phone. The memory is too low, I don't even know why this phone has the video playback since it doesn't have enough memory to do so. No card slot to increase increase memory too. I regret buying this phone. Now I can't exchange these 2 phones for different ones. People, don't get this phone at all, only if you use for basic features. There are much better phones on Amazon to get."
2,Not what you think,"I don't own a razor myself. However, my two best friends do as well as my dad and sister. From what I can see, the Razor is a cool phone and works well...for a few months. But,it begins to go down hill after that. My sister simply dropped hers off our chair (2 foot drop) and it caused the screen to go completely white. No suprise, she had to get a new phone. Also, my friends phones as well as my dad are extremely slow. Also, the picture quality is pretty poor. Don't be fooled by the first few months of quality, this phone isn't good."
3,cute but average,"This phone is lightweight, cute, flashy color, and nice LCD screen. The camera seems to be okay too. My only real complaint, and for me is a biggie, is that the speakerphone stinks. It just isn't loud enough to hear while driving--unless it's 6"" from you. Never had such a sorry speakerphone before. I've tried the Razor headset adaptor (not bluetooth) and it doesn't seem to do well either, maybe it's just a dud. I don't think it's worth the money--wouldn't buy again--but it's cute & a novel idea."
1,Can't Transfer Existing Number?!?!?!,"I'm very disappointed that this problem exists when this phone is ordered through Amazon. How hard is it to add ""For New Phone Number Activations Only"" in bold text in a prominent location within the description? Instead, they list ""*Restrictions Apply"" at the end of a paragraph. Now I guess I'm looking at a return shipping and restocking fee for the pleasure of doing business. This may be my last Amazon purchase."
2,Having problems with mine.,"I have had this phone for 2 months now and am having problems with it. First off, I will say, I love the bright pink color and the look and feel of the phone. That's why I overlooked some of the negative reviews and got it anyway. Firstly, the battery life isn't very good. I have to charge it every other day. I keep it on all the time, but don't talk on it alot. But the more serious complaint is that is occasionally just turns off on me (when battery isn't low on life). And it occasionally just ends calls - doesn't turn off, but drops the call, and this is when it shows good coverage. I will probably have to either return it or get warranty replacement or something. Having said this, my husband got the same phone (different color) at the same time with the same carrier and isn't having the turn off/dropped call problems. His battery life is annoyingly short too."
2,Don't bother,"I've had the RAZR V3 for about six months. Love the pink color, but the reception REALLY sucks. For some calls, I can't hardly hear the person on the other end of the line. I'm a women and I find that it's really uncomfortable in my hand. My previous phone was much more comfortable in my hand. The screen is very nice and large making it easier to read, but overall, I wish I wouldn't have spent the money. I'm dropping my SIM card into my old phone to use."
1,NOT,The speeches of Winston Churchill did NOT contain the speeches of Winston Churchill: it contained only sparse fragments of speeches with much trite military footage. The snippets covered a lifetime of speeches (including late WWII and as an elder statesman) in only 30 minutes. Anyone with serious interest should not waste his time with this poorly edited tape.
3,Fun read,"Quick and entertaining. Period romance with murder, mystery and a supernatural twistHeroine was interesting and quirky enough to make it believable"
3,"Dangerous, a romantic mystery",The mystery part of the plot almost over-shadowed the romance of the story. Cute and quirky heroine with a dark and mysterious hero.
4,Capture My Interest,"I enjoyed this book. I will admit I usually like a little more love making scenes in the romances I read, but this one caught my interest right from the beginning to end.The Story and the characters are orginal, and don't remind me of copies, from other books I've read. And I will always love a book with Romance and laughter combined."
2,A real disappointment,"This was the first Amanda Quick I have read and I came to it with high expectations. She has a lot of fans but I'm certainly not one of them! 'Dangerous' was one of those irritating historical romances that is set in a period, and then no further reference is made to the times. The historical accuracy was appalling. Worse than this however was the complete lack of depth of characterisation, and totally unbelievable sensationalist plot. I must admit to liking more quality in my novels than Quick provides."
5,"Dangerous, is just that! Dangerous!!!","Amanda Quick is one of the best historical romance writers I've ever had the pleasure of reading. I've read all of her books, and thought this one was AWESOME! Pru is a terrific heroine who is REAL!!! She is not perfect, but you love her anyway. Sebastian is real, too. That's why I love Amanda Quick! You can relate to her characters in any time frame!"
3,????,I purchased this book a while back on a recommendation of a co-worker....I have started and stopped several times. Finally I have decided that I would complete the darn thing.... I usually enjoy romance novels but this one I just can't get into.... I don't want to write Ms.Quick off just yet I may try one or two of her other ones....but this one is not impressive at all..
2,Disappointig,"Having previously read Seduced by Amanda Quick, I was quite eager to purchase another of her books as I thoroughly enjoyed Seduced. But I have to say that I was sorely disappointed with Dangerous. Firstly, there was little or no chemistry between the two main characters, Prudence and Sebastian. They were quite boring and the constant referals to him as the devil himself and the Fallen Angel became quite overbearing and repetitive. Prudence was an annoying berating female that was constantly ordering Sebastian to be mature and to do what she expected him to do. Her constant nagging and outrage made me squirm and dislike her even more. I could not see how they came to be in love because there was no depth to their relationship...."
3,Misleading product description,"I ordered this as a replacement for my OEM rearview mirror, as it was wider, and had dragons (always a plus!). However, upon receiving it, I found that it DOESN'T have a day/night switch, making it useless, IMO. Cool looking, but don't buy, unless you don't drive at night!"
3,"Great pictures, but no happy ending","The pictures in this book are great, but the story is a little lacking. It is about a slug who ""One summer Sunday while strolling on soil, with its antennae signaling, a slug sensed a slope."" The slope turns out to be something ""sinister"" and there is no happy ending here. With a tender heart and used to happy endings, my little girl (7) was saddened by the ending and told me that she did not want me to read it to her the following night. I told her that I would change the ending to ""and though the frog speedily slipped out it's slippery toungue, the slug somehow sneakily snuck away."" In the book, the slug isn't so lucky! And I don't feel that the slug was smug at all, he was just going for a walk up a hill."
5,GREAT SHOW. GREAT DVD SET.,"MEMORIES OF DUKES OF HAZZARD HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BROUGHT A SMILE TO MY FACE. THIS DVD SET HELPED REMIND ME OF WHY THAT IS. IF YOU WATCHED THE DUKES WHEN IT WAS FIRST ON, YOU SHOULD BUY THIS DVD FOR NOSTALGIA. IF YOU NEVER SAW THE DUKES, YOU SHOULD BUY THIS DVD TO GET CAUGHT UP ON WHAT YOU MISSED!!!"
5,The Dukes of Hazzard,This is another great season of a fun family friendly TV show. It was a good addition to the collection. This one takes us back to the original cast too.
4,Where's the subtitles?,Great series but what happened to the English Subtitles which were present on seasons 1-5? Also it's a pity Warner Brothers went back to double sided discs.
2,Almost...,"A move in the ""write"" direction but this product falls short with two crucially absent functionalities... it does not have innate handwriting recognition capabilities and you can only use special paper to take your notes. The former is just shortsightedness (regardless of the manufacturer's claims) that might be correctable with third party desktop applications, but the later is simply inexcusable, pushing its profile and flexibility beyond the convenience of a traditional PDA. Almost, but not quite Logitech. Keep trying though!"
1,IT DOESN'T WORK,"It's no use whatsoever to claim how wonderful this product is and how clever it is to have a pen that ""remembers"" what it writes, when the damned thing DOES NOT WORK.I'd installed the NET framework necessary, followed all the directions in order (including trying to ""train"" the pen to recognise my handwriting), and even re-installed the software several times.It DOES NOT WORK.Oh, the pen vibrates and blinks different colours, in the order it's supposed to, as IF it were working, but it does not DOWNLOAD anything.I'd even double-checked that the drivers were loaded, re-set the pen (then did a hard re-set), etc., and all in the right order. And guess what?That's right. It doesn't work.What's the use of having an interesting concept for a product and interesting looking product, when IT DOESN'T WORK?"
5,Eliminates the pile of memopad sheets & post-its,"I'm a lawyer. When clients would call for quick discussions, I'd grab a pen and post-it pad or memo pad, whatever was near the phone, and jot down notes. These would just grow into a stack near my monitor, and I'd have to throw them loose into my working file. Now I keep the io and an io post-it pad next to the phone, and no more stack, which is a huge annoyance eliminated."
2,Logitech io Pen,"The idea seems good but for my general application I found it overkill and too much to use, in fact I didn't pursue it beyond initial partial installation -- I'm assuming that it works. Note that you have to use special paper which I would assume costs quite a bit. Alternatively I plan to merely scan a plain sheet of paper with writing or drawings and save it as a .jpg document using multiple indexing available in the Windows photo manager. If I want to extract a portion of a page I can use a picture editor."
2,"Good idea, Horrible Product","I purchased the Logitech io Personal Digital Pen from Amazon.com on Dec 5th. I received the package on Dec 11th. I found the pen to be over sized and hard to write with, but decided to give it a try anyway. Upon completion of the calibration task, I set out to put my pen to use. The ICR (Image Character Recognition) software did not recognize any lower cased letter and rarely recognized my capitol letters. I continued to try calibrating the pen, but was never successful. The idea of this product was wonderful, but the delivery fell far short of mediocre."
1,What IS it????,"I thought the IO was a handwriting recognition device that would save me from banging the keyboard. No such luck. According to the reviews I should have read before purchasing it, it simply makes pictures of what you write.Anyway, I tried to install it and after receiving numerous error messages contacted the company. Their recommendation would have involved going deep into the system to make changes on something I hardly can understand. (I started to do so and ended up with my XP interface changing partially to a WIN 2000 interface --for shutting down) Maybe I'll put it up for auction on the Web. I guess I'll go back to voice recognition."
3,Watch out gimmick - the notebook is expensive.,"The pen itself works great exactly the same way as ads.Somewhere I read that a xerox copy of included notebook page works. But I find it does NOT. Copied paper has a lot of flaw parts, so you will lose some parts of what you write.The notebook is expensive. Here 3 pack of notebook is around $25. At other place, the price is similar."
2,"Logitech ""Beta"" Io Digital Pen","It took less than an hour for me to decide that Logitech has a way to go before releasing this as anything than a beta. The ICR function, even after training 4x's more than suggested, still mixed up all of my vowels. The restricted spaces you must write in are far to small to use quickly. It never did interface with any of my office programs. When I asked it to create a to do or a calander entry it pretty much ignored me. When trying to contact support, the auto return said they get back to me in two business days.For almost two hundred dollars, and the need to write only on a certain type of paper, makes this product undesirable for our needs."
3,Disapointed,Only works with special paper that costs about $.20 per page. I'm a college student and the last thing I need is another regular expense. If I had know it I wouldn't have bought it. If you have the paper it does what it is supposed to and that's why I give it 3 stars.
2,Fine if you do one thing at a time,"This pen is fine if you do one thing at a time and one page at a time. However, if you work on multiple tasks on different sheets of paper, forget it. You will spend almost as much time merging documents so that you can recreate the pages that you have in front of you. Also, there is an option to delete the files that were used to create the merged sheet. It does not work. Be prepared for one file for each sheet. Overall, this is not as good as the crosspad. Also, forget the character recognition. I printed as carefully as possible and it was only accurate about 10% of the time."
2,Rocker Board,"The rocker board arrived on time and in good condition. Unfortunately, it was not what I expected. It was too large and bulky. I contacted the manufacturer, Sissel Inc. They provide return policy info. including a reference code to be written on the box. I've returned the item and am waiting fo confirmation and credit."
2,pro rocker 20inches by theragear,I bought a pro rocker board 20 inches from theragear on 5/d8/09 but they promised a cd demonstrating how to use it. They did not send the promised cd and I have difficulty trying to master it. I used as rocker board at the physical therapy center where I went and I had no difficulty after instructions from the therapist. I cannot get started on this one. I wish that verizon would check on this as I left messages with the manufacturer but received no cd and no response. I bought it over a month ago. Some how I feel that I have been deceived by the company. I was looking forward to viewing the cd so I could get some idea of the proper way to use this board. Patrick Finnegan I am 74 years old and this is supposed to be for seniors and children.
3,Decent for price,"Bought this instead of getting the Fitter brand I have used in the past. This one is pretty good. The material on the top is a bit more slick than I would like for patients, but it will do. Otherwise construction is decent."
2,Rossini' Sonatas,"Except for number one, this one is slow and tedious. Herbert Von Karijans version in the 70s for LPs showed that these Sonatas could be performed with Style, Grace and Movement. This volume trends toward the mechanical without feeling."
5,Outstanding,"Burt's Bee's Evening Primrose Oil Overnight Cream is really something. When I'm without it, my skin looks tired and dry. It's a must during the winter. I even use a little bit of it during the day with a lighter moisturizer. I hope it never goes off the market!"
3,Great product for nightime,I love Burt's Bees products. I was using this as a daytime moisturizer which it most definitely is NOT. It is very dense and best suited to use at night. Even if your skin is very dry it is too greasy to use for the daytime.
4,Good Holster,"I've owned several types of holsters made from different materials..Fobus are really functional and inexpensive and this one holster accomodates 9mm, 40,and 45.. so 3 for 1 is a deal..paddle style is very comfortable.."
3,Cheap works okay,"Pretty tight on Glock 21 gen 4, you have pull at just the right angle . No tention adjustment. Quick snap works best. Also watch the paddle as it occasionally wants to draw the whole holster - not good. Fair for the money- but I ordered a Blade Tech later."
3,"Fits ISSC M22, but not really","I purchased this Fobus GL3 specifically for the ISSC M22 because is was listed as applicable.The issue: Holster body protrudes over 1 inch past the end of the slide.Technically, the trigger guard and frame are a snug fit.The 3 star rating is because of questionable advertising as an M22 fit.This model holster is made for a much longer slide."
4,Pretty good holster.,"The holster fits like a glove on my glock and is very secure while carrying. My complaints are: until the holster has been used for a week or two the amount of force needed to draw it are in my opinion too excessive. After the intial ""breaking in"" period the draw becomes much smoother. My other complaint is a rather marginalized one; if you are over-weight (like me) and have anything hanging over your belt line then the gun will dig into your side every time you sit down. Also, if you're wanting this for a concealed carry holster you will probably need to buy a coat that is longer than the norm. The bottom of the exposed portion of this holster hangs to the bottom of my pants pocket hole."
5,Workin out or just relaxin,"Although the instrumental version of Fitness Rhythms is designed for working out, It's also excellent for sittin in the Lay Z Boy. It gets the feet tappin and the blood rate up, and you don't even have to leave the house. The rhythmic drumming runs thoughout with additional instruments and vocals weaving in and out. If you're a couch potato or an athlete, you'll love this CD."
5,Incra TSIII- 32 inch Fence,Product shipped as described. Arrived OK. Product as described. Very accurate table saw fence. 2-3 hours installation time.
5,A favorite family tradition,"My daughter and I love making these pancakes on weekend mornings. Found a box at a local store long ago and fell in love with it; when the store went out of business we were delighted to be able to find more through Amazon. Easy to make and delicious. We especially enjoy preparing them like crepes, rolling up jam inside and putting a stripe of whipped cream on top."
5,Love them but can't find em',"Our family loves these pancakes but we have a hard time finding them in stock at our local Target and Jewel Food Stores, uggh! Would buy them here but shipping is soooo expensive! We still love them though."
4,"Great, thin pancakes","Lund's Pancakes are great if you like thin pancakes. We like to make them with a mixture of cream and water, which seems to prevent them from sticking to the griddle. We've also not had much success cooking them at the recommended 400 degrees, instead using the usual 350."
4,Good for Teens,"This book is really good for teens, it focuses on things that teens need to know. But the book is also really helpful for adults. I would recommend buying it."
3,"Fun, but not that durable","The overall toy is fun for kids, and pretty safe, but the arrows (let alone the bow) only last about 50 shots. Mostly it is the fins being torn loose from the arrows by the bow itself, as the fins catch on the rubber bands that power the arrows. Also the fins are attached to the shaft with a fairly brittle shrink wrap plastic and once it gets a tear in it, it is only a matter of a short while till they fall off."
2,Buy more arrows or just get another bow?,"These arrows are the same as the ones that come with the bow with one difference - they cost more then buying another bow! The bow comes with 3 arrows which are the same as the 3 that come in this ""extra arrow pack"". If you need more arrows, I recommend you just buy another bow to get them instead of this ""extra arrow pack"" because the bow (w/ 3 arrows) always seems to be cheaper then getting these 3 extra arrows. Fun toy though - really flys!"
5,Finially,I have been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD forever. I remember watching this when i was a kid and could not find it for years except on VHS. It was just like i remembered it.
2,Don't waste your money,"I enjoyed the Great Race. I did not like this movie. I bought it based on another persons review. Don't make the same mistake. Tony Curtis in this movie is terrible. The story is terrible and the filming of it is terrible. I had to cut it off 1/2 way thru the movie, it was that bad. Not sure if this was made before or after the Great Race but it was real similar, just not as good."
4,Time makes no difference,This is a hilarious movie and is just as funny now as it was when I first saw it in 1969.
1,Not fanny :(,"I think that ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" is the best comedy of all times but unfortunately ""Those Daring Young Men In Their Jaunty Jalopies"" is not fanny :("
1,"Warning: This is not a ""G"" rated film!","First I must say that I agree with the first two reviewers as to the quality and entertainment value of this video. Having purchased this for my family and myself, I was suprised to find a ""G"" rated film showing brief nudity in the waterhole scene. Whether or not this was an oversight by Amazon, I cannot say. I only hope that Amazon will reclassify this film's rating for an otherwise entetaining picture."
3,Lesser flow-up to Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines,"Although the production qualities and recreation of the mid to late 1920's style Monte Carlo Rally are good, this film doesn't really gel until the half way point when all of the various teams finally come together and start to interact.There are a few abrupt cuts, perhaps originally for length, although it would have been better to cut the multiple screen montages instead, which are only effective on the large screen. But then, when they were making it, I know they weren't worried how it would look on a television set.Terry Thomas plays the son of his character from Flying Machines, providing a sort of bridge between the two films.If you don't recognize Jack Hawkins at first as the mysterious Count character, it is because he's had his larynx removed at this point due to cancer, and had to be dubbed for the remainder of his life."
5,Great family viewing.,"I purchaesd ""Those Daring Young Men and Their Jaunty Jalopies"" and :The Great Race"" to replace a VHS copy. They have plots and do not rely on flash bang special effects."
