2,Very disappointing Blu-ray,"This review is not on the movie; it's one of my favorites and we had been waiting for the Blu-ray for sometime thinking it would be incredible. Unfortunately, the Blu-ray is not good at all; the picture at times appears grainy and I can see no difference in the DVD vs the Blu-ray. It seems no effort was put into this transfer and the result is very disappointing."
5,THE Movie of 2001...Highly Recommended,"Obviously, the people who listed the negative reviews did not give the movie enough time. This was a spectacular movie, including a great soundtrack, and superb acting. The music was inventive and captivating, and I was surprised that both Nicole and Ewan had such remarkable voices. I believe that the movie, actress, actor and director all deserve the amazing credit that they have been given. I am now on my 9th time watching this DVD, and am very happy with all the extras that come with it. For 2001, the movie industry has been blessed with a complete winner."
2,"Rent before buying, definitely","There's a musical sequence in the movie (can can) that is very, very impressive.And then there's 80 more minutes of stuff.I found myself completely bored after about 45 minutes. I really couldn't figure out why until I realized I'd almost been duped by all the shiny objects, which were desperately trying to cover up the extrordinarily dull script. After a bit over an hour it seemed that the director, and the film, simply ran out of steam, and were just trying to wrap up the film in such a way as to not call attention to the lousy story. The actual direction, once the really big numbers are over, is pretty awful. Every single time something ""heavy"" or dramatic happens he resorts to a blurred slo-mo of the characters in question. After seeing this same trick 5 times I was officially sick of the movie. Blim, blam, zim, zam, at the end of it all it's smoke and mirrors.As a spectacle it works fine, but then ""COPS"" is a spectacle too. As a film it's severly dull."
4,Wildly imaginative,"This movie furthers my belief that Baz Luhrmann is on drugs. Why? Well, some of the scenes seem like he must've been on acid when he wrote the screenplay, and when he directed the film. He's probably just overly imaginative.This is a wildly imaginative and intriguing story of Satine (Nicole Kidman), a dancer at the Moulin Rouge, and Christian (Ewan MacGregor), a writer. The two fall in love, but are prevented from being together by forces that they can't control. Nicole and Ewan have incredible acting and singing talents, which make the film enjoyable, but what is even better is that they have terrific chemistry. Their chemistry makes the movie even more touching.Unfortunately, this exciting musical does have a lot of sad stuff in it, so it isn't a complete happy-go-lucky film. It's incredible and I would love to watch it over and over."
5,My favorite musical!,"I adore this film. I love the look and feel of it. The acting is superb and the singing is surprisingly lovely especially by Ewan McGregor, who did a fantastic job. His performace was endearing. I am not normally a fan of musicals, but it is so different from all the rest that I couldn't help but love it. And the soundtrack is one of my favorites. The music is gorgeous and catchy, its possibly one of my most favorite soundtracks. Plus, there are plently of speaking scenes if you don't like the 100% singing movie. It has a great mixture of both and I recommend it to anyone."
1,Sickening Cinema,"The people that praise this film are kidding, right? Either that or I want what they are on to see how great this movie is to them. I mean, what's the deal here? 2 hours of not only predictable but MTV video like, jumbled up sequences. Not one song original! Okay, okay, maybe one or two, but is THAT what a true musical is suppose to be? Ewan and Nicole's talent it wasted. Not one scene is not surreal. That may be good sometimes but althroughout the movie it makes you sick! I cannot stress how much I hated this. And that Ziddler was also making my friend sick--his face was too creepy, never gets out of your mind. Go see a musical worthwhile, like Cabaret or The Sound of Music. Hell, even Mary Poppins is better."
2,Much ado about Le'Rouge,"The stars in this review are solely for the stunning visuals. While I have spent time watching worst movies, I simply cannot believe the amount that went into this supremely unoriginal conceit of a film. La Kidman oozes glamore from a bygone era, but even she could not keep me tuned into this messy reeking fop. From the kitchy score and dated soundtrack, to the unbearable acting and staggeringly unfunny lines, this film moves me not. The script begs the question of just why this film was made. It could have been a soso film if the director wasn't intent on gagging the audience with the hellatious singing of all involved. This will be a sad footnote on musicals in the 21st century. I cannot say more than to advise watching with the volume down...way down."
1,Not Enough Adjectives to Properly Describe How Bad It Is,"Here's a few adjectives to give you an idea of just how bad this film is: atrocious, HIGHLY overrated, badly acted, the worst film that I have ever seen, proof that Hollywood hype can dupe most people into thinking something is good with a few shiny costumes and a couple of big names, unoriginal, Christmas plays by 6-year olds are better than this, I would give it minus 3 stars if I could, so horrible you may want to give up tv and movies for a few months, monstrously unintelligent, disjointed, and a smash up derby is able to touch you more emotionally than this utter garbage."
2,sound issues,"Bought a second copy of the DVD hoping the sound defect was a fluke, but both copies, no matter what tv I played them on, had terrible sound balance issues. Ruined the songs!!! The orchestration completely drowned out the voices, unlike on the cd and in theaters where it sounded fantastic."
3,A Grand Musical,"Moulin Rouge is a musical and I want to say that again. Moulin Rouge is a musical that contains no more than half dozen lines outside of lyrics. The songs do carry the story of a young man (Ewan McGregor) in love with a working girl (Nicole Kidman) and the tragedy that follows.The songs are love songs taken from popular hits over the years. Lacking was the famous chorus line that Offenbach had in mind when he wrote ""Gay Parisian"" (or ""Can-Can""), as it is sometime referred.Overall the film was good and entertains well."
4,strange,"Very strange at the beggining, but for me it was addicting and you just kept wanting to watch more."
5,I was bit by the love bug,I'm in love with this movie. I don't know why this movie has had such a profound impact on my life. I feel like I am a part of this movie now.
1,lobotomy friendly,"If you have been fortunate enough to have undergone a lobotomy you will enjoy this film. It is visually stimulating, so it will entrance the simplest among us. Unfortunately the lack of content, dialogue, plot,continuity, ect. .....and the deplorable singing...., will only serve to annoy anyone who has half a brain cell. It is unfortunate that a director with such a fine beginning- Strictly Ballroom, Has become a Hollywood sell-out, ..... personality over content, show over substance."
1,Worst movie ever,"My review wont be fair because I only saw the first 15min of the movie. That's all I could take. I didn't see anything that resembled a story or acting. Just a fast moving camera, people screaming and horrible music. After 15 solid minutes of that I had to shut it off. It was making me sick to my stomach."
2,messed up movie,I dont no this movie was ok. I was confused half the time and it was really werid. They did a good job singing. I should probably see this movie once again maybe i would understand it better.
1,Not a worse movie this year.,"This movie is one of the worst you'll ever see. Unless you love musicals at any cost, this will not only put you to sleep...but you'll have a horrible hangover when you wake up to leave the theater. The awful singing is only the start...but the pathetic close-ups throughout the film make it almost unbearable to watch. You keep wanting to stretch your neck back to get some perspective. The story is pure cliche...right out the butt. Some silly courtesan finds real love and no longer wants to shell it out for money. Etc etc. Nicole Kidman's acting is really bad, as well. Ewan McGregor is fine, but the role he's given...well...it leaves something to be desired. The film is banking on the hype created by the Cruise-Kidman divorce along with the prostitute outfits of the Aguilera/Mya/Lil' Kim video. Blech."
4,Slow start BUT Lovely Ending,"I thought Ms.Kiddman was spectacular, It was such a sad but true ending. She was excellent, and her voice...oh her voice was down right inspiring. I can oly dream of meating her on day. So I can tell her what an inspiration she has been. With all her frustrations in her life she can still pull off an extremly Beautiful Show!!! Thanks for the opertunity to say so.... Mary Horigan"
5,MOULIN ROUGE,"I loved this movie, I can't see how anyone could say otherwise. It was very imaginative and it was also incredibly lush the setting was something out of Wonderland! Nicole Kidman was WONDERFUL! The story line was intriguing and I loved how the play clashed with the true movie's storyline! This is a movie everyone should come to see. Nicole Kidman was truly absolutly WONDERFUL!!!!"
2,Endlessly irritating,"Yes, ""Moulin Rouge"" is a technically daring movie. But it is also one of the most irritating movies of all time. The director Baz Luhrmann rarely keeps his camera focused for more than a split second on any actor in this movie. Everytime you want to get a good look at the actor's face and expressions, Luhrmann purposely swings the camera away from the actor. It makes for a very cold and distant presentation of the story.And the songs are often screamed (rather than sung) in an annoying high pitch. This becomes grating, even repulsive to hear.I think Baz Luhrmann has appeared on every entertainment news show on television praising the ""artistry"" of his own movie. That kind of vanity just adds to the general distastefulness of this movie.Getting a root canal is a less painful experience than seeing and listening to this in-your-face, over-the-top, and reveling-in-its-own-excess shipwreck of a movie. And when I say ""shipwreck"", I'm talking the Titanic."
1,This was a joke right..,"I had the misfortune of seeing this film at my father's house over the holidays, and came away convinced that I had in fact missed nothing by avoiding it's theatrical run.What might have started out as a novel idea to attract my generation to turn of the 20th century cabaret theater wound up being a self-indulged and haywire production that will leave many viewers with a bad headache. At times, the effects seemed sureal, as if the movie crew was suffering from a collective migrane durring the conception and production of this team.Even the pairing of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor (who really do deserve credit for trying to make something out of the story) could not save this vastly overrated production from collapsing in it's own excesses. Considering much of the prepublicity billed the film as a nostalgia period piece, some of the selections such as Elton John (and certainly Nirvana) are truly puzzling."
1,"Christ, Is there a refund department???????","Anyone seen Mel Gibson's ""We Were Soldiers"" where the black lady is being told her husband was killed and all she can say for 1/2 hour is ""Uh-Uh....Uuummm-Uuuummmm....Uh-Uh""?? That's exactly how I felt sweetie. Oh the humanity!Her husband wasn't dead! She had just watched this entity and was trying to warn her friends who came over but she could not get the words out.LOL...LOL...LOL. At least I still have my sense of humour because I am seriously doubting my sanity since insisting we rent this at long last and having put friends through the tragedy. The least I could do was turn it off half way through and shout dinner to relieve the trauma I had put them all through.Save yourselves, I may be lost yet."
1,One Of The WOrst Movies I Have EVER seen,"I have never reviewed a movie before, but if i can save someone from seeing this god awful movie, then it is worth it. I was cringing in pain watching it, Baz Luhrmann should apologize to everyone who saw it, personally. Made me wanna give Battlefield Earth another chance, for your own sake, stay away from it."
2,Musicals need to be DISTROYED!,First off I would just like to say that I ABSOLUTLY LOATHE MUSICALS! Nothing against the whole plot line or theme of Moulin Rouge it's just that I liked it the first time when it was called TITANIC! Jesus people in Hollywood PLEASE get a new idea for a movie because I think I've seen the same one 20 times now! Nicole Kidman was good in the movie but sweet Jesus THE SINGING! Oh it burned like a 1000 suns to hear singing over and over and over again. Seriously I didn't think it was a musical when I went to go see it but when the third song came on in the first 20 minutes I almost walked out.
2,Eh...,"I honestly don't know what all the hype was about... although I found it visually exciting, the plot line and the characters were dull and if i had to here them sing that bloody 'i love you blah blah blah' song one more time i was going to drive something into my temple. but i give it 2 stars for art direction cinematography and costumes... If your looking for a good musical go for Chicago"
1,"If I could give it zero or negative stars, I would","Reading some of the other reviews, I have to wonder if they have seen great movies before. If not, then I can understand their recommendation of this waste of celluloid for sheer lack of comparison to something entertaining and original. A vaste collection of derivation does not originality make, but this film fails to even copy well. The singing is horrid, the acting is worse, and nobody seems to have any idea what they're doing. Now I am a fan of most of the stars, but I seriously feel ashamed for them for there being such a record of the worst they could possibly do. The sets and costumes fail to be artistic and only come off as garish, reminiscent of a working girl on Hollywood Blvd at best and autopsy photos at worst. If you have a yen to see this film, do yourself a favor and stab your eyes with a fork instead."
1,"Painful, Meaningless, and Incoherent","I didn't know what to expect, but I didn't like what I found.This movie is spastic. There are dozens of edits every minute, each unjustified and collectively incoherent. The plot hangs together by a thread, weakly starched by lyrics borrowed from several familiar songs.The speedy stop-motion video and overdubbed cartoon sound effects are insulting.The movie views like a bad acid trip.That this movie received such interest and critical acclaim speaks to the unsatisfied demand for creativity from Hollywood, and the void of taste swirling in the wake of the American populus."
5,this is a MILESTONE in theatrical and musical productions,"Although the people above may criticize this masterpiece, do NOT be drawn in by their mindless drawling. This is an EXTREMELY exhilarating movie, full of color, humor, and tragedy. Although quite different from what one may normally see in modern movies, I can confidently say that this movie will pave the way for future musicals to come. Baz Luhrmann does an excellent job of creating a character to audience relationship, drawing us to comprehend and sympathize with everything that occurs in this movie. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman give outstanding performances and bring so much character to the roles that they play. Although quite flashy and unconventional in the beginning, the love story and that hardships that it endures makes up for it. Along with the music and the intricately weaved plot, I would definitely put this as one of my top 5 favorite movies. ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved in return""."
2,You need to be wasted to get into this film,"After trying to watch this film sober (and I couldn't), I have concluded that if it is to make any sense and/or if you really want to enjoy it, you need to get ... drunk. This film is midnight movie material along the lines of Rocky Horror . . . in other words, get into costume, drink a bottle of tequilla, and enjoy the nonsense."
5,get swept off your feet,"Great direction, visuals, and songs. ""Moulin Rouge"" is an offbeat, sometimes dark, but charming musical. The beginning of the movie is somewhat of a visual orgy, but as the movie progresses, audiences are introduced to the growing romance between Satine and Christian. As they fall deeper in love, their relationship becomes more forbidden accordingly. Jim Broadbent does a great job as Zidler; his facial expressions are comical and grotesque in an almost paradoxical way. Emotions are captured onscreen flawlessly. I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who would be delighted to see Ewan McGregor burst into song on a giant elephant."
5,Moulin Rouge 2001,"I absolutely loved Moulin Rouge, I went to see it because I heard the music was modern, but wow...I was so amazed. I am a music student, so I can appreciate the quality of the music and singing in the film. I do not get emotional about movies, but I was shaking when Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor sang together. I cannot wait to own the movie and I recommend the soundtrack."
1,"Great movie, defective DVD","I loved this movie. I would give it 5 stars. The DVD, however, is another story.Soon after its release many people reported a lip-synch problem on the DTS soundtrack. On December 20, Peter Staddon from Fox Home Video posted a message on the Home Theater Forum web site asking for specific examples. Many people replied. It has been nearly 2 months now and THE PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED."
2,A Disappoinment!,"When I bought the ticket for this movie, I thought it was a remake of the old movie based on the life of Toulouse-Lautrec. I expected to see some semblance of reality. This movie was trash-a mere vehicle for a lot of trashy rock music. The only thing good about it was the beautiful Nicole Kidman. The farcical treatment was absurd. It was hard to take it seriously because of all the silly musical bits. This was nothing like what Paris looks like. A ridicuous elephant draped in front of the Moulin Rouge? Seriously, save yourself money or buy a movie that's worth the viewing."
2,Strange movie,"My mom took me because I liked the song. The movie was really strange musical. I did not like it. My mom said she knew all of the songs and she laughed at some of the things, I didn't. I couldn't wait unitil it was over"
1,Moluin Rouge!,"This is a fine example of a very expensive film that misses so many opportunities that it is difficult to count the ways.First the music at the beginning of the film makes no sense-- it just doesn't - none of it relates to the historical (early 1900 hundreds), or cultural (Paris??? or MTV).The characters are cartoonish and the sound is just too damn loud!!I did love looking at Kidman and McGregor though- they are about the only thing that saves the picture.How this movie got eight Academy Awards is beyond me.I found it to be a total waist of time."
1,The Greatest Lesson: Don't Watch This Movie,"I don't understand how women who claim to be feminists could enjoy Moulin Rouge... it's about a bunch of dancing prostitutes, the leading one (Kidman) proving to be indecisive and dies of TB which she probably contracted from one of her clients. And that awful quote, ""The greatest lesson you'll ever learn..."" The greatest lesson I learned from that movie: women are easily led astray by bright shiny objects -- namely jewelry. That's another thing! The first song she sings is, ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend."" Rampant consumerism/materialism."
1,I have two words for this movie....,HATED IT!!!!!!!!!!I give it one star only because you can't give half a star. I can't imagine why Nicole Kidman was up for an Oscar for this trash.
2,"The great, the bad and the strange","All of the ""Love"" songs were delightfully sung and fun. Cinematography was often dizzying. At times the film was like a trip back to the acid-tripping 70s. Weird. Moments of greatness mixed with tediously dizzying camera work. If you love Nicole Kidman, you'll love it. She's beautiful and charming. As Satine, she sings quite well,(sounding something like Helen Reddy)even though she's in the throes of TB. Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo were engaging and quite believable.Generally, a strange creative attempt. But I do admire Baz Luhrman for trying to bring his vision to life."
1,Now I realize this was trying to be original...,"Or maybe it wasn't. That's the whole problem with this movie. Now I know people try to say this is a ""love it or hate it"" scenario, and they may be right. I, for one, hated it, from the bastardization of 80's pop hits to the sickening brilliance of color to the cheesy plot and poor acting, I thought this was a decadent, self-indulgent movie whose doubtless enormous budget was ciphoned into all the wrong areas. Both Kidman and MacGregor deserve much better. The camera angles are annoying, and the plot is terribly unoriginal. I can't say it enough - stay away from this movie.However, I also hated ""Romeo + Juliet"". I love Shakespere, and I also love musical theater. So maybe you just have to appreciate one or the other."
1,Moulin Rouge,"I couldn't stand this movie, nor could my friend who was with me. We got up and left after about 15-20 minutes. It was loud, gross and the story line stunk. If I had not been to the original Moulin Rouge in Paris in 1994 I would have never gone to see the movie. I was grossly disappointed."
1,Confusion,"I didn't like the set, didn't like the costumes, and could not get completely through the movie. TOO MUCH singing! I don't like musicals and didn't know that this was a musical. I hated this movie so much that I gave it away! I only purchased it because the entertainment world fooled me into believing that it was a great movie. HA! I would have had a better time watching paint dry on the front porch in the dark! There was too many things going on at the same time to make sense of the movie. If I were Nicole Kidman, I'd seriously think about suing the director, my agent, the producer, the actors and all of their spouses for putting me in such a horrible predicament!"
1,Pure torture!,"I went into this film expecting to see exciting production numbers, great chemistry between the characters, and non-stop ""eye candy"". The overly-frenetic style of the editing spoiled all of that to a major extent. Even the opening number, a creative melding of the songs ""Lady Marmalade"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" had the camera whizzing around much too rapidly for it to be enjoyable. The plot was choppy and just plain silly. The character development was non-existant. The volume on the dialogue was often too soft, and the volume on the songs was often painfully loud.Ugh! Sheer torture! If I hadn't gone with someone I would have walked out 10-20 minutes into the film. I sent an e-mail panning this movie to my friends, and I got back two immediate responses that they, too, wanted to leave early but sat through the entire horrid mess."
5,Unbelievable amazing,"I have to say that at the first, i was not really interested in see this movie, but in the moment that i rented it, i realized that is one of my favorite movies ever, is so great, the songs in it are just awesome, a great musical, fun, interesting, with an amazing performances, wow, in addition to this, the format in DVD has a lot of stuff, with videos, photo gallery, behind the scenes and many more things that are just waiting for you to come to see them."
5,Incredible,"To see this movie is to be in the presence of greatness. If you have any appreciation of art, cinematic or otherwise, you must see this work. It is simply incredible."
5,"SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR","Moulin Rouge is a truly outstanding film about truth, beauty, freedom, and love. It provides wonderful actors and an absolutly amazing storyline. I have never seen anything like it and don't think that I ever will again. One word to describe Moulin Rouge: ""SPECTACULAR!"""
2,"Could have been low key and beautiful... It's sad, really.","I expected a haunting drama glowing with crimson lips and lit by dim light bulb filaments, set in Paris on a damp night circa 1890.Instead, I was blasted by a melodramatic comedy that made no sense and was just all in all stupid. Buskers on speed bounce around in a cartoonish manner making jokes. A fat guy dressed like a ring leader rolls around singing Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"". In one dance scene a dwarf woman does the Charleston to an awful remix of ""Lady Marmalade"".This movie lacked so much and yet there was enough good material in there to make a decent picture. The backbone romance worked well and some of the dance numbers could be slowed and set to period music. Maybe I'll buy it on DVD and edit together my own version. To remake Moulin Rouge would be my big project if I ever become a millionaire or decide to go to film school."
2,Didn't live up to the hype . . .,"Seeing this movie once was enough. I loved the costumes and art direction and the movie deserved its Oscars for those. What I didn't like about the movie was that the director couldn't seem to decide whether it was a campy spoof or a serious musical. It ended up being neither, which made it weak. I did like the cast, but didn't like the music - it didn't fit and was distracting. Some great ideas were there, but I don't think the picture put it all together. Maybe that's why Luhrmann wasn't nominated for best director and why it didn't win best picture.Previous reviews have described this as one long MTV video. I think that is a fair description. It would have been much better with original music, a better story and without a frantic pace that assault's one's senses."
2,"Spectacular, Spectacular - not","When I saw the previews for Moulin Rouge, I truly thought that it was going to be a good movie. I like musicals and I like both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. So when I saw it on HBO, my brother and I decided to sit down and watch it. By the end, I was cheering - because it was over.I could write a long review, or I could summarize it - I didn't like the acting, I didn't like the costumes, the choreograpy was terrible, the camera work was sub-par, and the unoriginal music drove me crazy. The dramatic parts were stiff and the humerous parts did not make me laugh. What a disappointing, terrible movie."
2,...mess,"Several adjectives come to mind when watching this movie; from brilliant and beautiful, to annoying and stupid. Baz Luhrman needs to... make up his mind. Does he want to make beautiful movies that unfold like a series of brilliant moving photographs, or does he want to make infantile drivel where he can use painful close-ups, pointless fast motion film, and tacked on sound effects that would make the producers of America's Funniest Home Videos blush? I just hate having to subject myself to the latter to get to the former. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are both great. They somehow manage to maintain some dignity despite some the [junk] they are asked to do, say, and sing. If I were to rate it only on cinematography or art direction, I would give it an A+. This is a beautiful, train wreck of a movie. And though not everyone dies, the casualties are high."
3,A jaw dropper,"My wife and watched this after a friend recommended it. We were in shock - I can't say if that was good or bad. Most people will love or hate the movie. The more familiar you are with modern pop music, movies, and musicals in general, the more you will like it. I didn't recognize half the songs and I'm sure I missed most of the allusions. One thing I did get, though, is that Ewan McGregor is an amazing talent!"
4,Intoxicating.,"From the opening sequence to the falling of the curtain, a masterpiece. The music is intoxicating, drawing you into the heart of the Moulin Rouge. The images seduce you. Like the courtisans, Baz Luhrman makes you believe this is real. You will be entertained."
5,amazing,"this is easily one of my favorite movies and when i couldn't find it at walmart, target, or netflix, i was devastated! thank you amazon for always having exactly what i need when i need it. and the price was a steal for the perfect condition the DVD was in! (:"
4,Exactly what it was meant to be,"I must admit that Moulin Rouge isn't as spectacular as some have rated it as being. But, for what it was supposed to be (a wild ride of color and sound serving as a backdrop for a simple romance story) this film has hit its target. It was not meant to be a historically accurate documentary representing turn of the century Paris. The inclusion of contemporary pop culture only makes this movie more lively and appealing to a modern audience.As for Nicole Kidman's acting, she was convincing at times but at others she fell slightly short. Stiff and overdramatic when she should have been otherwise. Nothing extraordinarily bad, and nothing to mar the film.I found the high energy pace of the film combined with modern elements to be engaging. Although you will find no enlightening ideas or underlying meanings in this film, it is very entertaining (which is what a movie should be, right?)."
1,extremely dissipionting,I thought this movie was supposed to be good it [stinks]. it was full of cliches and [bad] songs that they stole fom other places. It was stupid and really ... if i could give it zero stars i would. I think it is the biggest ... mistake that this movie is nominated for best pictue come on it a complete joke.
1,Mirrors its time,"Wretched, incoherent excess for the MTV generations. Ideal for anyone who can't or won't read and whose notion of an intellectual challenge is a video game."
5,Great Book,"Great book, applicable for both men and women. The author's message was also very practical and reality based."
4,Happiness Instruction Kit: No Assembly Required,"This book is a lovely and practical guide for reavealing simple ways to re-frame situations and behaviors in everyday life. The re-framing is done through a postive (the glass is half full) perspective. The author is gifted in both her ability to use practical everyday examples that everyone can understand, and, her humor. As a therapist, I see many people who feel depressed and doomed to their negative feelings. Practicality and humor are refreshing and novel approaches for an unhappy person. The author is also generous in her use of personal experience. Her biography, which she honestly shares with her readers, is perhaps the best aspect of the book. Ms. Young was born into sadness and ""figured out"" her way into happiness. The book has an ""If I can, so can anyone"" appeal. It is a lovely gift item and is uplifting."
1,The worst CD in history,"This is has to be, without a doubt, the worst CD in the history of music. I would rather hear Tibetan monks throat sing for a week straight, or blast Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music directly in my ear for hours, than listen to this utterly insane drivel. I actually met Bayard back in the late 90's when I managed my college's radio station.He was walking around, promoting this vile piece of awful noise. He was spouting some nonsense about how Japanese is the language of the future and that his likenes (an X-ray) is on the cover.Like his persona, this CD comes off as extremely pretentious, and above all just plain awful....(groan).Do NOT buy this CD, even with a gun to your head. How bad is it? This is the only CD I have ever intentionally broken in my life!"
4,"Wow, a non sensational book about the devil...","I was really impressed, especially after reading the review of the other amazon customer...This book is no novel, but it is a fairly comprehensive history of how people see the devil, whether some kind of gargoyle looking monster or the con man or even a metaphor for the evils of mankind.Stanford does a good job of showing one thing above all others - that people will see the devil they want, and the devil won't dispute them.For a biography, the book actually talks about the devil less than the circumstances where he was a power, and how people react(ed) to him. Less a biography than a reoccuring theme, it is still worth reading if you like history books."
4,Pretty Good,"This was pretty good, for the most part. The only thing that makes this book slightly dull is that it is a touch repetitive in it's information. But what makes it interesting is that it draws a parallel between God and the Devil. Very interesting, save for that minor glitch."
1,Readable? Not by me,"This book was a real disappointment. Though I wasn't looking for a sensationalist approach to the topic, itwas dry, dry, dry. The fact that so many of the reviews I'd seen referred to it as ""readable"" should have been a red flag. Readable compared to what? An accounting textbook, perhaps, but nothing that one reads mostly for enjoyment. The author is obviously a good scholar, but not engaging, at least in this book."
2,He is no expert on the devi,"He is no expert on the Devil, i was very disapointed in the book, i could of found infor and put a book together."
2,needs improvment,"it is very difficult to read. The black letters and a dim light make it difficult. The altimter is not even close. I know it works by berometeric pressure, but I am not 45 feet below sea level. I have tries to correct it according to the directions but!!! Also, the directions are off, when I go west, it states east etc. Do not recommend it."
3,Mis-advertised,"Bought this product because it said there was an indoor/outdoor thermometer, however there was not. I returned the product, but have only received ""store credit"". Never used the product so I can't give it a fair review, though it looked nice."
3,Interesting,"Being a fan of post apocalyptic movies this was a must-see for me. Though the film is bit dated, a bit long and slow, I am glad I did. It is Robinson Crusoe taken to the next level. Strange the director never made any other films."
1,Ouch!,"I bought this CD after reading the only review attached to this site. What a tremendous disappointment! This is terrible. ""White Christmas"" has one of the most annoying voices I have ever heard on a serious recording. I can't believe the Mitch Miller name has been attached to this album. Please don't confuse it with Mitch Miller and The Gang. Buyers beware!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"From the first track, my thinking was, ""Where was Mitch? Did he even show for the gig? Not enough chorus! Not enough orchestra! Poor arrangement! The production is a real first-class schlock-job!"
1,Requires expensive peripherals to work at all!!,"Very disappointed in this product. Purchased to use on a camping trip for both light and heat, since I'd read about how warm they get. The more fool I! Long story short, there's a WHOLE lot of fine print they don't tell you about up front: Requires a lamp, requires an ""outlet"", requires some arcane piece of kit called a ""power grid"" that Amazon doesn't even carry!May be a great product IF you already collected all the accessories, but I have better things to spend my money and my time on.P.S. INCREDIBLY fragile. Definitely not top-shelf camping gear!"
2,Not what I thought I was getting,My mistake is not reading and rereading the description - I thought I was getting 100 Wattincandescent light bulbs. These are not the same.
1,Beware,These are not designed for 120 volts as we have in the US. The box has prominent disclosure (which is no where on the website description) that they are designed for 130 volts and if used at 120 volts only give off 1290 lumens as opposed to 1700 (25% less light for the same number of watts).
1,Terrible,"These break about once a week. This is the worst light bulb in the history of civilization.When the last one goes, it's back to government bulbs."
1,Some corrections to things that have been claimed by other reviewers...,"I just wanted to correct a couple of things with this post. First of all, incandescent bulbs aren't banned, but they are being phased out. The United States is one of the last countries to do so. Brazil started in 2005, and Europe in 2009. The U.S. won't phase out incandescents until 2014. The U.S. bill was passed by President George W. Bush in an attempt to free us from depending on hostile countries for oil energy.LED bulbs are not dangerous or toxic, and contain no mercury. Their light quality is quite good, and comparable in temperature to warm incandescents, and they use insanely small amounts of power. See, for example, theEarthLED ThetaLux 9-Watt Warm White LED Light Bulb."
5,I am stocking up,"These bulbs were purchased as a reserve until the idiotic law banning incandescent bulbs is finally repealed. Since I live in California, this may be a while. In the meantime, I am stocking up."
4,Great price,"Bought them for stock, did not notice the 130v rating plugged one in seems plenty bright. so i'm basically happy."
4,Light bulbs,I bought these light bulbs to stock up because of the government banning them after this year. They arrived quickly but one was broken. Hope the others work ok.
1,Arrived broken,"My bulbs showed up broken. The box wasn't labeled as fragile. Amazon wants me to return the items, but I can't mail a box leaking shards of broken glass."
3,Pack them better!,"One of the bulbs was broken, begging the question ""how many of the rest will work when I need them?""But if the rest work, I'll be mighty glad to have them at this price, (Or maybe at ANY price!)"
2,Lots of broken bulbs,"I read the reviews commenting on broken bulbs but decided to take a chance on this. About 1/3 of the bulbs were broken and, if there was that kind of impact, I can't help but wonder about how long they'll last considering the filaments may be weaker now. The product itself which wasn't damaged is fine. On a positive note Amazon is refunded my money without requiring a return shipment so I got the undamaged ones for free. I'll not buy bulbs online again though because it seems like a total crap shoot as far as the condition of them when they arrive."
5,Stock up before the Incandescent Light Bulb Goes the Way of the Dinosaur,"These are great light bulbs! They last long, and offer great light to read by, or support whatever it is you are doing. Stock up before the incandescent light bulb is officially illegal to sell in the United States. Amazon offers a fantastic price on these. The one shipment I received with broken bulbs (out of three shipments so far) was replaced with a one-day shipment via FedEx."
3,Good value.....but open the box immediately to check for breakage,Ordered a couple cases of these and did not even unpack them. When I did I discovered at least 1/3 were broken
3,"What Publisher's Weekly Said About ""The Impersonator""","Hypnotic and intriguingly corrupt ... charged with sexuality and menace...This is an utterly compelling tale of a master manipulator who insinuates himself into various characters' lives...In quick, incisive strokes, Hammond delineates her singular cast, while her plot twists send frequent pinpricks to the heart, ahd brain and the guts."
3,Unnecessary for this particular book,"For a book which takes three hours or less to read, and ideas which are common pop-philosphy, Cliff's Notes for ""Anthem"" is a little over-kill. The essays are more difficult than the original book. The entire concept of having Cliffnotes for a book like ""Anthem"" is antithetical to one of the points Rand is trying to make, to think and assess for one's self.Her thesis comes to a simple idea: it is up to the individual to think for the individual. ""Anthem"" is just an allegory to present the idea.I recommend this, but barely. It can help the reader unwilling to read Rand's short book, or unable to process her basic tenets.Anthony Trendl"
3,Not really worth for school project,I purchased this to help with book but found it not necessary. The book itself is very short and this seemed as detailed if not more so.
3,The last album I got by Corey Hart.,"""Fields Of Fire"" #63, in 1986 was my last Corey Hart album. Three more hits here, but I only liked two and one album track. The ballad I really liked was ""I Am By Your Side"" #18, ""Dancin' With My Mirror"" #88 and Angry Young Man"". This album again stumbled into MOR hogwash. **1/2 overall."
1,FIELDS OF FIRE,"I'm sorry, but I haven't received this CD yet. I cannot rate this item. I sincerely hope the CD will arrive soon: I like this artist."
5,Swiss Army Bargain,"I had recently looked at this watch in an outdoor store I frequent. They were selling it for list price - $295. However, there was a small scratch on the case near the bezel. I didn't want to buy a scratched watch for list! So the store offered me 20% off - $235. I told them I wanted to think about it - it seemed like a lot for an imperfect watch. Later, I searched the internet for this watch and found the lowest price here. I was dubious that I could buy the exact same watch for $135!! But I took a chance and ordered it. It came with all of the documentation and in perfect, new condition. I am extremely pleased, and also thankful I didn't pay $100 more for a scratched watch at a store. Also, the watch came in only a few days. I am a happy customer!"
1,infibulation is not head shaving,"Foot binding in China is now considered barbaric. Personally, I'd rather my feet were mutilated than my labia and clitoris, it would be far less painful. Now, please, let's not have men actually comment on this. It is just too sad and corrupt. There is no comparison to Jewish women shaving their hair to infibulation. Of course, there is a very close comparison to Orthodox Jewish women and their burka-wearing cousins. Cutting a woman's genitals is to be compared with the whole culture of Eunuchs. That has gone by the cultural wayside. When will men finally become secure in their manhood and quit picking on women?"
4,Excellent Contribution to our Heritage,"Methinks Mark Newbrook doth protest too much. This is brilliant stuff.Yes, it's a tough read for those readers not from a scientific background, but nothing worthwhile comes easy. The author hits the nail on the head. There are deep deep truths in this monument, as there are at Stonehenge, Angkor Watt and the Pyramids. Ross Hamilton has made a great discovery and deserves our admiration and respect."
2,Stud gun,"Not to happy cheap product , not all I thought it was gonna be . Would never of spent the money if I were to have seen it in a store ."
2,.............don't get burnt like I did!,"This DVD is a compilation of three different concerts of the Hag, two set in the early 80's and one in the 70's. That is the type of sound quality you get here, very poor quality......they advertise it as digital sound but don't be fooled. The video aspect is also poor quality, one concert shot in a football stadium in the middle of a sunny day makes for a very boring lack-lustre ambience. This one should have stayed in VHS format. This DVD is an Insult to the people that expect Quality material out of their new investment. The Hag has done some excellent ""real digital"" concerts lately, surely the producers at Brentwood Video will replace this DVD with a Quality Product!"
2,Very Dissappointed..........frankly a rip-off,"As a lifelong fan of the Hag and a viewer of many of his concerts both in person and on the tube, I was very dissappointed with this compilation. The sound and video quality is a total insult to any DVD owner that expects good quality for his/her investment. In this day and age of digital video and sound there is no excuse for over-marketing this trash. I have never watched it after my initial trial run."
3,Good Intro for Newbies,"I missed the Willie Nelson appearance on one of the version of ""Okie..."" which the jacket promises. A couple of numbers are repeated, which wastes time (Pick one version and be done with it!) Haggard really gets lost in the (Astros?) Stadium...not a great backdrop...Glad I wasn't there! This was not a slick production. Would have preferred Haggard narrating with some insight on each song and seeing cuts of different songs at different concerts (like George Jones does with great success on one of his videos). I think true fans will be somewaht disappointed by the prospect of would could-have-been."
2,You'd have to be a true fan to buy this one,"If you are expecting Merle Haggard to sing his hit songs in the same tempo and lyrics of the original releases then this DVD is not for you. The songs on this DVD, which contains 3 concerts in one, are are at a much slower tempo. Further, many of the songs are not sung to the same words as the originals and not complete versions.Very disappointing overall. Only buy if you are a ardent Hagard fan. Only worth 2 stars."
4,Fantastic,"First of all, I don't have any other releases to compare this DVD to, so I can't say what's ""missing"" compared to other releases, or how the sound quality compares, etc etc etc.All I can say is, as a longtime Merle Haggard fan, he has NEVER disappointed me and this DVD is no exception. Three concerts, recorded over the span of about 15 years, showcasing nearly all of Merle's best known songs as well as his takes on the standards (Bob Wills, Jimmie Rodgers, etc). His band kicks and smokes and swings, same as ever... and Merle is in fine voice on all three sets.Saying there might be ""better"" Haggard concert discs out there, to me, is like saying there might be ""better"" Van Goghs or Picassos than the ones on show at your nearest museum or gallery. Maybe so, but when you're dealing with that level of talent, it's all relative. Three Merle concerts on one DVD... why quibble??"
1,Not much lift --but a lot of riding up,"""What a lift?"" Not exactly! I can get away with wearing this without a bra only when I am looking for the ""tied down"" look, but maybe that's because I normally wear a D cup. But I wasn't really looking for a bra substitute. I bought this looking for (and expecting) a control garment to handle the bumps and rolls that ruin the look when I wear a fine gauge swaeter or twinset. Not too much to ask, and it would have done the job -- except it rides up something fierce. I immediately thought this was because the garment ran small, so I bought one a size larger --no luck. The only way to stop this annoying feature of the undergarment is to tuck it into the waist of a snug fitting skirt or pair of pants, and then not to sit down. Not so much fun. Oh well, back to the drawing board!"
3,I remembered this much different...,"I watched this over the Christmas holiday. I have to say, I remembered it much different in my childhood. It's heartwarming Disney Musical magic - but remember the time period."
1,Terrible message for little girls,"Didn't like the story line or the quality of the production. It just wasn't at the same level as Mary Poppins or Sound of Music. We conveniently ""lost it"" so we wouldn't be subjected to watching it over and over. Ugh."
4,Good old fashioned fun,This is a great musical that I remember from my childhood. All the nursery rhyme characters I always read about were suddenly alive and dancing and singing in a fun Christmas-time story. Kids will love it and parents will enjoy some old fashioned fun helping their children create holiday memories.
4,ANNETTE FUNICELLO AT HER BEST,"I TRULY ENJOYED THIS DISNEY MOVIE AND ANNETTE FUNICELLO WAS AT HER BEST. ANNETTE DISPLAYS HER BALLET TALENT. SHE'S AN EXCELLENT DANCER. TOMMY SANDS IS ALSO AT HIS BEST AND EVEN ANN JILLIAN IS IN IT (AS A CHILD).WALT DISNEY'S CLASSIC BRINGS TOYS TO LIFE BEFORE ALL THE COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY OF TODAY! SEE THE MOTHER GOOSE CHARACTERS COME TO LIFE AND ENJOY A TRULY ENJOYABLE HOLIDAY CLASSIC WITH UNFORGETTTABLE SONGS FEATURING ""MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS""."
2,Disney fun -- Disappointing DVD release,"A fun Disney film with a winning cast and clever visuals set to memorable music. Why only 2 stars? A typically dismal Disney DVD release -- altered film ratios (i.e. not presented in its original theatrical ratios) and no extras. This is sad, especially knowing that Walt hosted a behind the scenes ""Disneyland"" program the year the film was originally released. Considering what Disney Home Video is capable of (see the EXCELLENT ""Vault Disney"" releases), butchered releases of Disney films are very disappointing."
5,Takes me back,Use to watch this movie as a child. I love that they decided to brg it out on blu-ray. My little boy loved dancing around the the music. Def takes ya back.
3,Babes in Toyland,The product was in excellent condition but it took longer to receive then I thought it should. normally I have items I order in less then a week this. This item took 2 weeks before I received.
5,Adorable!,"It is my all-time favorite Christmas movie. It's corny but you have to love it. It's so sweet and charming, you'll be in the ultimate Christmas mood by the end. Doesn't compare at all to the Laurel & Hardy March of the Wooden Soldiers. This is the greatest."
3,Babes in Toyland,I found the delivery etc good.The product in very good condition.The product itself a poor depiction of the Babes in Toyland
2,....Oh..Prunella....!,"It's Duller Than Dishwater...Stagebound & Hokey..A Lousy Pan & Scan Release..No Extras...Blah..2 Stars For Winn, Bolger, Sheldon, Calvin & Annette...If Sands Had Any Smarts While Dating Nancy Sinatra, He Would Be In Vegas Today Instead Of Loppin' Tops Of Pineapples In Hawaii....!"
2,Poor DVD,"I haven't seen this movie, but I wouldn't buy this DVD for a first look. I mind that 27.9 percent of the original theatrical image has been removed for the DVD exhibition, so that the DVD image fills my entire 4:3 television screen (theatrical aspect ratio - 1.85:1; DVD aspect ratio - 4:3). However, if you're okay with that, enjoy!"
5,I grew Up with this Disney Movie,"Annette Funicello, Tommy Sands, Ray Bolger, Ed Wynn and Tommy Kirk are forever in my memory. This is a great film full of fun and joy. It is full of color, music and happiness. I loved it growing up and I still love today."
1,Beware: not widescreen,This movie deserves to be seenthe way it was made. You won't get that on this DVD.
5,love!,I was so surprised that my 4 yr old Godson sat through this movie since its so old. Let alone he is now obsessed with it!!! its an oldie but goodie!! he sings along and knows all the words its the cuttest thing!!!
5,Classic Disney,"I have been searching for some time for this movie, the later Disney stuff is not of interest. The nursery rhyme stories come to life in this one and it is entertaining for adult and kids alike the ""fight"" scene is not the type to cause stress to little people and the ""March of The Toys"" battle music is very stirring. That scene is the main reason for me looking for this one. A very light hearted movie I think many will enjoy for a change."
1,STUPID....DON'T SEE IT,THE STUPIDEST MUSICAL EVER. THE TITLE IS MISLEADING TO SOME GUYS. THERE ARE NO BABES IN THIS TOYLAND. LITTLE KIDS MIGHT ENJOY THIS MOVIE BUT I DOUBT IT.
4,like an old favorite christmas ornament,"Sure there are many of the classics like rudolpd and frosty and a charlie brown christmas, its a wonderful life, plus many new""classics"" for the holidays....that have stood the test of time a little better then babes in toyland....but like a n ornament thats has been passed down from gen to gen there are holes in the exterier,the gloss may be worn but you wouldnt part with it for any thing!!watching it makes you feel good !!"
3,OK,I found an old tape we have that had some movies taped off the Disney channel and this was on the tape so I watched it yesterday and I thought it was ok kind of a cute story but not my favorite Disney movie and it just didn't appeal to me as much as some other colorful musicals like The Wizard of Oz and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory but it was a lot better than that 1980's made for TV remake and I would recommend this version and the original Laurel and Hardy version!
3,A little too childish for even children,"While there were some entertaining moments, overall I was disappointed with the movie. The main characters (Annette Funicello, Tommy Sands) were not particularly inspiring, and their acting was, in my my opinion, only marginal. The plotline was very obvious, but I think it got better into the second half. Ed Wynn was in his usual top form, and it was a pleasure to see Tommy Kirke and Kevin Corcoran in the film."
5,Loved it so much!!,"I can't believe how wonderful this was to watch!! Memories of childhood came flooding back immediately. The music, the colors, everything was just as I remembered it!! In fact, I couldn't believe how I even remembered the songs. It brought tears to my eyes. Truly still a classic and as far as I am concerned, a one of a kind film from Disney!!!"
4,Got it!,"Looks good, some pages in the corner were bent (I'm a perfectionist, so this may not matter to some). There was no writing/highlighting in the pages. The seller even wrapped the book in some plastic to help protect it a little during shipping. I think that was great. Thanks!"
3,Worthwhile for the enthusiast,"This is a great record to have if you're interested in Rocky Horror as a phenomenon. The songs are somewhat rough and unpolished, lending the whole performance a sort of ""school play"" air. But it's great to hear the first cast ever, and expecially good for comparing to other cast albums. This is not perfect, or slick, or definitive, but it's the same songs you most likely know and love, with the added charm of being chronologically the first Rocky Horror recording."
3,Older Used VCR Tape,Used and was advertised as suchWill not convert to CDI now have to keep my VCR to play this film
5,Parallel Bible,Great for Bible study! 4 versions side by side for better understanding of the Scriptures!
3,T-shirts,"I ordered this item on line and it arrived very quickly and so I would have to say the service was excellent. The quality of the shirt however was not what I expected, especially for the price."
4,Super Reader,"Sniegoski has got this down, I think.""It was a near perfect day up till now. But zombie cyborgs...Hellboy sighed. ""I'm not sure I deserve so much fun.""This novel has the right combination of humor, horror and pathos for Hellboy, as a group of spirit-mediums attempt to incorporate and raise a god they worship.All the crazy weird crap is there, too, along with Director Manning's Uncle Steve's ghost, undertakers, storage facilities for excess paranormal artifacts, and other oddities.His time working on BPRD comics certainly seems to have assisted the writing for this book.It appears this a series that it will continue to be worth getting."
2,dont waste your time,"the concept is cliched in a bad way and the writimg falls horribly, horribly short of remotey good. reads like something a student would write in highschool; all the characters have seemingly the same voice and personality, (that of the writers, im assuming) and such pesonality is shallow and somwhat blase. i have absolutely no interest in discovering whats happening since the evil dudes plot is revealed in the first few chapters, and the rest of the book is merely a set up for gregarious, bad one liners that all characters deliver equally and without indication that they 're even remotely different from each other. i made the mistake of reading 'on earth as it is in hell' before this and it set the bar high, and set me up for massive dissapointment when i moved on to this book."
5,Rick Derringer's Self-Titled Band's Debut is Great,"The self-titled debut album by Rick Derringer's self-titled band is a wonderful album. Continuing where he left off with his solo debut, ALL AMERICAN BOY, Rick Derringer makes great use of the lessons he learned working with Johnny and Edgar Winter and applies them to leading his own band, including incredible second guitarist Danny Johnson. All of the songs are great, and not a note is wasted. If you buy this one, ALL AMERICAN BOY, DERRINGER LIVE, LIVE AT THE PARADISE THEATER, and Derringer's albums with Johnny and Edgar Winter, you'll have a perfect library of his work."
5,"A ""must have"" book for every reader","The powerful graphics and engaging text make this book a ""must have"" for everyone who knows who Peter Plate is, who has listened to Nick Cave or been to a Fugazi show. Excellent in every way."
1,I bought this book based on David Reece's review....,"....and I was very disappointed with this book. It was difficult to follow and overwhelming. Maybe, I need a teacher to explain everything on each page because each page was packed with a ton of stuff in small print. Whew!! I never made it to the back of the book. I am still stuck at the beginning, and have gone back several times trying to decipher this book. I liked James Bastien's children's piano books a lot better."
5,Great book,"This is an oustanding piano book for adults in that it uses a multi-key appproach. Though not a traditional presentation, it facilitates reading and rhythmic acuity and ease of playing in any key. I have used it successfully since 1970 in my private studio and in my collegiate classes."
1,Movie is BETTER than Novelization!,"I enjoy occassionally reading film novelizations, because the add to the story...I think back to the original Star Trek films with minor story lines added that weren't in the films...made those that read the book have a richer film experience.This is NOT the case with Fantastic 4, unfortunately. Even more disasapointing is that I enjoy many of Peter David's original works. When he ""adds"" to pump up the story...to make this into a book...it is useless, boring wasteless stuff. A HUGE ff fan...this book made me actually decide NOT to see the film in the theater! Luckily my son won out...we went...and I discovered how much better the film is to the novelization!Save your money on this...and purchase a ticket instead!"
4,great little book,"This book was originally written in Germany in the 1990's, and translated to English for printing in the U.S.It's a great little resource, although the wording (translation) is a little humorous, as in instructions that come with products from China. It's a great book for the price. I recommend it, for the beginning fondue-er!"
1,Toy can not be chewed.,I expected a hard rubber type toy. Instead its a hard plastic. How do you tell a dog not to chew on their toy? She had the toy for a couple of hours. I had to repeatedly tell her not to put it in her mouth. She did not understand. She bit into it and sharp pieces of plastic were everywere. I threw it away. Its not a very good toy for any dog.
1,TERRIBLE!!,This item is terrible!! Please don't bother because it is a junky plastic tire with a ball in the center that only works about half of the time. Who wants a dog toy you have to keep put up and away from your dog??? Terrible product! I wanted to rate a zero but it makes you give atleast one star!
3,Not Much Oktoberfest Music Here,"As manager of ""The Oktoberfest Webring,"" I am always on the lookout for CD's of good Oktoberfest music. I found this CD disappointing because it not only featured various artists (instead of just an Oktoberfest band), but also contained a significant number of non-Oktoberfest selections from a CD called ""Folksongs From Bavaria."""
4,And even More Getting Your German On!,This item was bought (as well as others) for an Ocktoberfest celebration. The music is really good. Fit the party perfectly.
2,ok,was looking for a different feel. good sound and played well. just not what i wanted. sorry i don't know
4,Bavarian Music CD,I ordered this music to provide background music for a ProShow slide show about a recent Rhine River cruise. It meets my expectatiions.
4,Perfect background music for an Oktoberfest party,"I bought this as background music for my Oktoberfest party. I figured the price was fair was a CD that I will only listen to about once a year. The music really set the mood for my party and I'm glad I bought it. I'm just a wee bit disappointed that the CD wasn't longer. Had to keep hitting ""play"" on the CD player."
4,Bavaria in Music,"OK - I liked it. It may not be all beer drinking Oktoberfest music but it is good Bavarian music and some marches. I grew up there and I liked most of the music. Still, I was hoping for some real oompa music too."
1,Where is it?,"I ordered this magazine from an online website in March, 5 months ago. Never received a copy. BetterBusiness Bureau, here I come."
4,"Odd, but brilliant","I saw these guys about 15 years ago opening for another act and they blew me away. The rhythm section was a guy stompin' on a wood crate while rocking on a rocking chair. Feller must a been doin' 'bout 100 bpm. He also sang and played the harmonica. The only other performer was a guitarist. Really strange, a sound I ain't never heard before or since. But really good. Is there such a thing as Alt-Hillbilly? Catchy, rhythmic, and fun. In any case I bought the album, only to have it stolen from my car. Tickled pink to find it here again."
4,The Truth About Poverty in America,"This book gives an excellent insight into the lives of teenagers living in a low-income neighborhood. The book calls into question the American achievement ideology and forces the reader to reconsider his or her pre-concieved notions on poverty and its causes. The truth is that people aren't poor because they are lazy; they are poor because of numberous structural barriers in society that basicly trap them into poverty. This book is excellent for anyone interested in the social structure, but it would be better for someone who has never thought about the way society works and has the kind of closed-mindedness that cause many upper and middle-class people to view people of lesser social standing as lazy."
4,The American Achievement Ideology is False,"This book explores the lives of two groups of inner-city teenagers. One group adamently believes in the achievement ideology, and the other group rejects it. Hence the title, the outcome for both groups is the same. I recommend this book to those who refuse to cast away their pre-conceived notions that those who live in poverty are lazy and stupid. This book is a painfully real account of the different ways in which society plays a detrimental role in the lives of the less fortunate, while allowing the upper class to place the blame on the victims themselves (in the name of the acheivement ideology)."
2,Very Hard to Understand,We used this for mySocial Structure and Identity class and everyone in my class had trouble understanding this book .
4,Good book!New and some highlight.,"Buy it in the prime and is a used book. It's much cheaper than the school one. Good book! New and clean pages, and some highlight. But other things are good."
5,Great Reading,This book shows the lives of two groups of teens living in poverty and low-income areas. This book gives their perspective of the acheivement ideology and how everyone just is not meant to climb the ladder of social mobility.
4,this book was off the heezy-4-shezzy,"THIS BOOK WAS TIGHT JOE, YALL NEED TO CHECK THIS OUT. IT WAS ALL THAT. IT TOLD IT STRAIGHT LIKE IT IS. I WAS ALL GOOD. A TRUE DEPICTION, STRAIGHT UP,YO.*JESUS IS LORD*"
2,Plodding and too long!,"I just finished South Riding for a book club. I'm not sure who chose this book or why--perhaps the BBC miniseries was good. This 500+ page book should have been about 200 pages to speed up the plodding, boring storyline. Nothing terribly interesting happens, and I never truly engaged in these characters. When things finally seemed to be interesting, an important character died. Overall, this was a LONG, disappointing read. I don't agree with the hype about Miss Holtby's craft."
3,"Cool Art, Absurdist Story","I must freely admit that I don't get this series about a millionaire/freelance detective gorilla who sometimes zooms around on a jetpack. The black and white artwork is pretty sweet, although sometimes the stylistic shifts are a little jarring. But the story-which is nominally about his quest to recover the ""suspense jacket"" in order to understand his pas-careens so wildly around, jam-packed with absurdity and digressions, that it's hard to maintain an interest. I would say it's worth checking out for the artwork, but don't even try to follow the story."
1,poo poo,"perhaps i am not a music afficianado, but i like quality music... this is not!! on a scale of 1 - 5 i give it a negative 3.2 it sounds like video game music collaborated with a splash of a fisher price keyboard, and a dash of free nokia ringtones similar to those on my 5165. i now own a 12.00 frizbee that my doggie rex likes to play with ^..^ this cd was ""ruff"""
3,soso,soso book. many people said it will improve your writing.this book just pushed you to write a lot of essays.
3,Fun for kids!,"I bought an old, but clean copy of the original album from the 1960's based on the glowing reviews listed elsewhere for this recording. I think that children could certainly enjoy this album, but it isn't much to listen to for those of us who did not grow up with it. Mr. Green Jeans can sing, but Captain Kangaroo can't really carry a tune. I do agree with other reviewers that the songs left out on the CD are some of the better ones on the album. If they were going to cut something, they should have cut the rendition about the Christmas Carol.Overall, fun for kids and those who were kids when they heard it first."
3,Sad,"Wanted to replace the old vinyl record my parents have had since I was little, 25+ years. Too bad it doesn't have all the original songs, ""The hippo song"""
1,how could they!,"I was going to purchase this cd, i was so excited to find it available on cd! but leaveing off little fir tree and i wan't a hippo for christmas. why? these are two of my favorite songs! so i have the vinyl and even thou the sound wont be that good i will copy it. thinking about it sounding like scratchy vinyl is better. thats how i always remember it!"
5,"A bit of Tom Petty, some Eddie Vedder and a sprinkle of the Boss","If you've read my subject line, you know what you are in for in terms of vocal and musical styles. As the other reviewers have stated this album is a very good American rock and roll album. Not a weak track on the cd and they are the kind of songs which will instantly become imbeded in your skull. As an additional plus, this album was recorded by Steve Albini, who is one of the best in getting THE live sound or a raw live approach onto tape.Don't hesitate. Grab yourself this album now!"
5,"A ""MUST HAVE"" FOR FRENCH TEACHERS!","This album brings the French Revolution alive for my French students! Each day I supplemented our regular lesson about the events of the revolution and the reign of terror with a song or two from the album. By the end of the unit, students were asking me where they could buy it. I was pleased to be able to tell them that they don't have to go to France for it...they just have to go to Amazon.com!"
4,Historic Rock Opera,"Fabulous Music based on the historic events of the French Revolution. I have always been impressed by the story told (in French) and the way they are expressed in this Rock opera of the seventies. The events at the Royal Court, the storming of the Bastille, the Peoples committee condeming the King to the Guillotine, the scene of Marat being slain in bath and the story of 2 lovers ending in the death penalty of the man during the Terror period. Recording follows the original LP quality, which is not so high as current standards."
5,Great! Now that is what i call a surf book,"I got this book as a gift. It is simply the best book on surfing i have ever seen. Fun to read, it also includes a lot of great photos -- vintage and current -- from some classic california surf spots.Lot of fun to read. I've giving it as a gift to anyone who really loves surfing, the ocean, or the history of southern californa.inspritational too."
1,item not what I wanted,It is not anyones fault but the coupling I was looking for is not this hard plastic. I could not use this item. Since the shipping and handling was more expensive than the product itself it is not worth sending back.
2,Foreign Babes in Beijing:Behind the Scenes of a new China,"Rachel DeWoskin's move to Beijing was brave and adventurous; but she did not tell the story of her escapades well enough to engage me with any element of her memoir. The sexual trysts were less than reviting, and the book was promoted as akin to ""Sex in the City"". Hardly. The front cover was far more titillating than the pages following. I completed the book due to my""once started, must finish a book rule""; and it was a book club selection. Rachel's writing style didn't capture the elements that might have made it a great read. It should have been a sophisticated story; however, the writing style didn't catch it. Sorry!"
3,Not A Horrible Read,"Obviously, this book is not a primer on how things are in China today. Nor is it an informative read if you have knowledge of Chinese and its people. To myself, however, I found the book entertaining and informative. The mid-1990s were a transitional time for China, and looking back, one can imagine how much things have changed since then.Translating some of the Chinese that Ms.DeWoskin uses was helpful to me, a member of the laowai. I had only wished the publisher had used pinyin instead of italics. The copy of the book I purchased is from the UK, published by Granta.The main irritant I found while reading the book was the assumption everybody's family got to travel around China when they were children. Ms. DeWoskin sure led a more learned and priviledged life than many in my proletarian circle. However, that is why she was able to write the book."
1,Don't waste your time with this book,"I spent many years in China. Trust me, the writer of this book was more or less COMPLETELY unknown there. Idiotically, I still read some of this book.It's just a self-promoting waste of time and it feeds a million-and-one stereotypes."
2,Barely scratched the surface!,"This book is merely a recording of observations and characters of the author's time in Beijing. It was bland, like a dish without salt and spices. One would expect the author's interesting experience in China, and at such an interesting time for that country's emergence as the true global power that it should be, would yield a deeper insight and interpretation. It read like a sheltered, American undergraduate's essay on a trip to Beijing."
4,pretty good,"From 1991, this collection offers an interesting group of songs from Dennis Brown, Marcia Griffiths, Gregory Issacs, Culture, the Abyssinians, Andrew Tosh, Rita Marley, and others .Not the most essential collection you'll ever need, but if you are kind who likes to collect music collections on year by year kinds of collections, then this would be a good addition to your collection."
5,This album is AWESOME!,"i heard of Chaka from one of my friends who was friends with the band and i listened to Tired Of You not really expecting much, but i was blown away, this is an amazing album! Scared of Chaka is one of my favorite bands now"
2,Eh..,"A few bootcamp bangers but this CD recycles other peoples beats, dumbed and softened for a mainstream audience."
1,Trailer Trash meets Liars and Criminals,Watching this movie is like being invited to join the worst sort of low life's consorting over a dog fight in some garage on the wrong side of town....not entertaining.....not enlightening....just a chance to see fraud in action.Wait to watch it until you find it in the rubbish bin it wasn't worth .01 and shippoing.
5,Best Documentary,"This is without a doubt the most entertaining and fascinating documentary I've ever seen! A ""Rocky Balboa"" story with a down to earth female truck driver as the underdog star. I loved it."
5,Who the *$*@($%! do these art 'experts' think they are!,A great documentary. I've watched it twice and am convinced it's an original JP painting. Fingerprints and paint analysis have proven it for me.
2,"Neither WAP nor Servlets, but only a ""Cookbook""","The author makes a good attempt at describing how Java Servlets could be used for a WAP application. Though the intention of the author is good, the examples are made unecessarily complicated to demostrate simple concepts that could confuse a beginner. The Servlet version used in this book is rather outdated (v2.1) and the discussion on WAP and WML is just enough to explain the examples specifically developed for this book. There is also a big chapter in this book explaining the outdated servlet 2.1 api.Given the high cost of this book, the readers are better off buying a book on WAP and a book on Servlets separately. (Most of the books on Servlets discuss how to use XML with servlets.)"
4,WAP Servlets: Developing Dynamic Web Content With Java and W,"The book does an excellent job of explaining the concepts of wireless application protocols. But it is somewhat lacking in providing some good practical examples which users could try. For theoritical concepts, the book is amazing."
3,Pregnant Cats and Young Kittens Not Covered,"This book does not cover the week by week development of kittens in terms of dietary needs and social and motor control. If you are adopting a young kitten from a private home, this is not the book for you. If you want to breed cats, look for another book.The index is also undernourished. It is missing the words diet, food, feeding, nursing and weaning. The book does a good job, however, on the politically correct attitude to have toward a cat."
4,A great debut album!,"This is Leslie Phillip's debut album. It is great to hear this talented vocalist sing songs like ""Heart of Hearts"", ""Gina"", and ""Hourglass"". Enjoy this CD very much - this is Christian music."
4,Another great Kinsella book,"I was getting a little worried in the beginning that Becky would dig herself into a ridiculous anxiety-inspiring situation that I couldn't see the bright side of. And yes, she sets you up as usual, but having her alter ego- the sister that is so completely opposite- and yet you realize partially the same, was a very nice angle on a trusted formula. Kinsella writes such a perfect little read- fun and diverting, and it's NOT about getting the guy, idolizing the perfect shoe (well...)... or like such other awful chicklit. This is tight and fast and is about... economics, friendship and compulsion. Definitely worth a read. I also can't wait until shopaholic & baby."
5,A Very Good Ending,"I read it in one night... I just couldn't put it down. If you like Becky Bloomwood, this will not disapoint you. Everything you're looking for in a good chick-lit: love, suspense, guilt, silliness, sisterly-love, bickering and men who give in :-)"
2,Dont Waste Your Time,"I tried to love this book, I really did, but I just couldnt. Sophie Kinsella could have gone soooo many diffrent ways with the newlywed phase of Becky's life and chose to go THIS way? It started out pretty good, but lost me quite quickly. I had great hopes, since I -ADORE- the first three books, but this one failed to live up to its' predecessors. Maybe I had too high of hopes for this part of Bex's life, but if I were you, I'd skip this book."
2,"Still funny, but storyline getting a bit old","I loved the first Shopaholic book and really enjoyed ""Manhattan"" and ""Ties the Knot"", but the storyline is starting to get a bit old. I'm starting to lose sympathy for Becky, she just simply refuses to grow up and learn. That was cute for a while, but I'm starting to feel like Jess - that she needs to grow up! She's still making the same stupid mistakes and still expecting others to just cover for her and it started to get a bit old in this book.That said, Ms. Kinsella is still entertaining and funny, so it was an easy read. However, I think this character has run her course - unless she can find something new to do with Becky."
2,Shopaholic and Sister...,"Like The Princess Diaries, I feel that this is a series that should have ended after the third installment. There is such a thing as quitting while you are ahead. The intent of this novel clearly isn't to provide fans with another hilarious adventure of the main character, but to simply ride off the success of the previous three. It was completely unnecessary. I hope Ms. Kinsella cares enough about her writing to know that she should discontinue the series after this book.The plot is the same as mentioned by previous reviewers. Becky shops, gets in trouble and is bailed out. As usual. Does anyone else find it completely unbelievable that someone as resourceful and smart as Luke would be interested in someone as vain and selfish as Becky? And that ""twist ending"" wasn't a big surprise to me. I saw that one coming a mile away.Overall, it was an alright novel. It felt a bit rushed though. If only authors knew when to stop a title and move on..."
3,Great series....but this book isn't to standard,"I absolutely love the ""shopaholic"" series. As a shopaholic myself, I lose myself in them and I feel almost as if she is an extension of me (a far extension)This book, however, was not up to the standard of the rest of the books. I've read ""Confessions"", ""Takes Manhattan"", ""Ties the Knot"", etc and while this book was entertaining, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the others. Worth a read though"
4,Definitely my cup of tea....,"I read the book, loved it, and even cried at one point. Then I read some of the reviews before posting this. If you have such bad reviews, I must suggest that you don't read the next book. However, if you are like me and enjoyed every book in the series including this one, then hang on for Book 4. I read this book and others like it purely for their fictional content and romance-comedy style."
2,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I'm very dissapointed with the outcome of this book. I may not even finish reading it. so far I've read the forst 300 hundred pages and I've laughed only once. I don't know what all the rave is about. If you want a good read as I did-don't buy this book!!!!!!!!!!
1,This is the worst Kinsella book,"I agree with the other reviewers. In this book, Becky is an airhead. Same boring plot, nothing new.I can't bring myself to finish reading the book, it's so boring."
4,Shopaholic & Sister,"This product was in excellent shape upon arrive, but it came MUCH later than I expected! :("
3,Good but not as good as the others,This was a good book but it was my least favorite of the series. It is worth reading if you've already started the series.
3,"Funny, lighthearted","This is actually the first book I have read out of the Shopaholic series. Mainly that's because it was the only one my library had.This book was funny and great for a lighthearted read which is a nice change from the books I usually read.I only gave this book 3 stars because it was just not one that pulled me in. The main character, Becky, is amusing but reminds me of Amelia Bedilia (from the children's series) because she is such a simpleton! She obviously is blonde and at times it was annoying that she thought so plainly - not taking a hint or thinking more before acting.I will read the other books in this series since they got better reviews than this one. Maybe this one was the dud of the series!"
4,Love Becky- but the story was lacking,"I hate to say anything bad about the series I love so much, but this one was just not up there for me. I love Becky, but this could have been better. I would never not read it- and I'm glad I did. I was slightly disappointed."
4,Good but not VERY good,"I almost passed this one up because of the neg reviews here but I thought what the heck, I might still like it and I did. It's not as good as the first 3 in the Shopaholic series but I don't regret reading it."
4,Great book!,"This was a great book, I couldn't put it down. It's probably more interesting to woman, but still great."
3,Uptight Sister,"I love the whole Shopaholic series and expected to find this one just as enjoyable. However, the stepsister made me uncomfortable. This is an important read to understand the whole story and appreciate Shopaholic and Baby all the more."
4,LOVE IT,Like all of Sophie's books - I could not put it down when I got it. I actually have all of her books now. She is a very good writer.
3,Not as enticing as the first three,"This book follows in its predecessors' footsteps, but lacks the captivating essence that the first three had. Becky is still as lovable and charming as ever, however her spending habits have become tiring and you wonder how after three money fiascoes, she still manages to go over her credit limit. At times, you cringe at how flaky and dense Becky can be, when all you want is for her to wake up and see the real world. Kinsella begins to weave in some intriguing plot twists, but doesn't expand them as well as she could have. Some of them just disappear after being mentioned in a few chapters. Overall a nice read, but could have been an excellent read if both the plot lines and book length had been extended."
2,Should have stopped at 3,"Shopaholic and Sister was a huge disappointment. There were so many cliche moments, it seems Ms. Kinsella has cranked this story out under pressure from the Publisher, not from wanting to continue Becky Bloomwood's story. Awful plot, annoying characters, and Kinsella offers nothing new. I now hate Becky Bloomwood , and I used to love this character. Becky has become a useless moron. AVOID."
2,Eh...a good fluffy read but....,"It must say something about me that I sympathized much more with Becky's long lost frugal sister Jess, who at least has some sense. And I feel sorry for Luke--does anyone know *why* he was attracted to somebody who is so completely clueless about money and life in general?This book does redeem itself in the end, though, with Becky having the incredible revelation that she's been *gasp* spoiled all her life with people around her willing to forgive her faux pas and her goof ups, and parents who unconditionally accept her, and the great luck to get out of her scrapes. Heck, Luke pays off her huge credit card bills!Jess does exactly what i've been wanting to do to Becky for the past three books---tell her exactly how shallow and superficial her interests and concerns are."
4,Not as great as the others!,"This is a cute book, but definitely not as great as the first three. This book seemed far-fetched and at times a little ridiculous. I love Sophie Kinsella and her writing style, but this one did seem a little inferior to the previous three. Maybe the Shopaholic series needs to end!! Don't get me wrong, I love, LOVE, LOVE, the Shopaholic series, but like all good things...they must end...gracefully and well-respected! Think of all the great TV shows that just went on too long!"
2,"Love Kinsella, but Becky is insufferable","Seriously -- Becky Bloomwood is a pathological liar, incredibly irresponsible, and refuses to learn from her mistakes. On top of all that, she's a complete dimwit. I have to admit I keep reading this series because I always hope she'll learn her lesson (and because I shortsightedly purchased all five of the current books at once.) But it really is getting to be just too much. If you haven't started the Shopaholic series yet, save yourself and read ""Can You Keep a Secret?"" instead."
4,Shopaholic makes me laugh,"While Shopaholic & Sister is not the best of the series it is good enough. The book is another delightful escape into a fantasy life which, despite potential or temporary despair, always concludes with a sunny ending. The characters are well drawn. For serious readers like me, it is nice to take a break from depressing themes and insert a Shopaholic book once in awhile."
4,I love shpoaholic,I really liked this book it wasn't my favorite of Kinsellas book BUT it did make it unbearable to wait for the next book Shopaholic and baby. I have really enjoyed everything she has written
4,"pleasantly pleasant, a nice dose of brie when in need of ""cheesy-ness""","I highly recommend this book as a fun, funny chick-lit treat. It's the kind of book that provides a light and relaxing retreat from both a busy day and during sudden flashes of girliness.""Shopaholic and Sister"" is definitely light humor. Nothing 'deep' about it. But it accomplishes its aim--light-hearded humor, a young woman's intense love of shopping, exploring various parts of the world.Definitely a good way to live every young woman's fantasy of falling madly in love with a smart and rich and caring guy, traveling the world, and shopping until she drops.A must-read."
3,"Easy reading, and that's all","I think I enjoyed the first shopaholic book, then I took the second one, and I still liked it. Then the third, not bad. Then the fourth, then began to dislike Becky. I think I will stop read more story of hers. It seems her adventure falls into the same loop. Obsessed with shopping, then got fight with Luck and other people, then eventually and magically, what she has done ended up with victory. And Becky became a new Becky, Luck and other people started to love her again.Nothing new. Everything predictable. But it is a easy read. You can finish it in one day."
4,Great book but lesser in the series,"All of the Shopaholic books are great but this one was not as good as the others. Don't get me wrong it is still worth reading and leaves the impression that there is more to come but it simply does not compare to the first three books.Becky is even more out of control than ever in this installment of the series, when she meets her long lost half sister, who happens to HATE shopping. Becky with her overwhelming desire to be the best sister ever (because she was always an only child) tries so hard to get her new sister (who happens to be everything Becky is not) to be her best friend. The usual hilarity that comes with Becky insues and Kinsella once again provides her reader with great fun and laughs.Ending gives the impression that there is more of Becky's life to come... can't wait for another book in this great series."
5,This book rocks!,"Finally, a chick-lit sequel that's almost as good as the original. I was disappointed in the 2nd and 3rd installments of this series, but this one I liked a lot.Kinsella was wise to entwine Becky's materialism with a sort of naive optimism. She really believes that if only she had the right outfit, or took her sister to the right store, everything would be fine. Although she's shallow, she's never mean, so she remains likable throughout.I also liked the fact that this book had a sympathetic science nerd-girl character. Jessica was a bit of a pill, but she was still a decent, moral human being. I hope to see both characters again in another sequel--maybe Shopaholic and Baby?"
4,An Enjoyable Read,"Sophie Kinsella had proven the lighten can stike 4 times. But the 4th time might not be as brillant. In this book Becky seems to have lost her sparkle a little. While in some ways she still the same whirlwind that we remember her as, but in other way she's a little to over the top. The book is still an enjoyable read, and the ending does brings the old Becky's spirit back."
4,A Delightful Read!,"In all, Shopaholic & Sister was a great read. Like all her previous books, this one was full of humor and a meaning. Even though at times I found Becky to be very irritating because of her out-of-control behavior and narrow mindset, I really did enjoy this book. It was great fun to get to catch up with how Becky was doing after marriage and I just can't wait for another shopaholic book!"
4,"Good, But not her best","I loved this book as much as the other ones. I am a die-hard fan of Sophie Kinsella and I think everything she writes is wonderful. Although it was good I still think that Becky shouldn't be quite as careless and stupid. I mean how many things can you do in just one book? A lot apparantely, according to Becky. I still love her though and hope Ms. Kinsella will continue with the series. Becky's pregnant!!!"
5,Loved It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was introduced to the series a year ago by by best friend, and have loved every Becky Bloomwood book. I sit and wait patiently for the next one to be published."
2,a little disappointed..,I've read the first 3 shopaholic series and it was pretty satisfying.. but shopaholic and sister was disappointing. in fact i didn't even finish reading it. Becky seemed so shallow on this one. It left me wondering if anyone can actually be so shallow and self centered....i hope the next novels are better than this one.
2,Here she goes again!,"Unfortunately, Becky is at it again. Although I loved the previous shopaholic books, this one is never-ending. She pulls so many antics that it really insults the reader's intelligence! Come on, how can all these diasters happen to one person? I know it is fiction, but I felt that the story was quite dumb and I am glad I got it from the library!"
2,Just can't keep reading this book....,"I tried so hard to like this book. I loved the other ones in the series and Can you Keep a Secret?, but this book was boring me silly. I just can't take it anymore. I read about 3/4 of it and I just don't care about what happens to Becky anymore. Her character seems different now. Before she was intelligent, but loved to shop. Now she's a walking moron (maybe that's what happens to you if you honeymoon for 10 months). The story line is so obvious and I can't take it any more. I'm off to read The Secret Lives of Bees."
3,Not what I expected....,"I must admit, I LOVE Becky Bloomwood! But this book was not as good as I hoped it would be. I had to skip over some parts that I didnt care for, the boring sister made the book kind of...BORING. I agree with some of the other reviews, Becky needs to grow up a little. I thought the concept was good at first ""Becky becomes frugal"" but that only lasted like what 2 pages? With that said, I will read the next book because I still love the protagonist, and I have to finish out the series."
2,2 and a half stars I guess - (this book = the day after christmas depression.),"Sophie? What is UP?!?! This one fell flat after two chapters. ugh. I just couldn't bring myself to continue reading it. I guess book number three (ties the knot) was SO great that this one seemed like a let down - I would read it if I were stuck on a plane or something but even then I might just fall asleep and I HATE saying that b/c I loved Kinsella's other books but this one just didn't pull me in - maybe b/c Becky and Luke are already married and honestly - I don't really care about her long lost sister, it just doesn't do it for me.I would like to see Kinsella write more books that aren't series' and then introduce Becky on the side as a background character in the novel just to get another narrative point of view on her.my other friends who read this book agreed w/ me - ""ties the knot"" is better...."
3,Becky's antics got old by this one.,"I like these books, I really do. I especially liked the 2nd and 3rd, however this one grated on my nerves. She is in her late 20's and she is acting like she is an 11 year old girl! How many times does she have to bury herself before she learns. Of course all things are fixed in the end but I admit by this 4th book her antics got old. Still with all that said I, of course, will read Shopaholic and Baby as soon as possible!"
3,Nice light reading...,"This book was a nice quick light read. I was a little shocked at how much money she spent so freely, so I wasn't surprised at all the grief it caused her. And some of what happened to her was a little hard to believe. But I enjoyed it and I liked the characters and I will probably read another one of this series."
4,ANOTHER TRIP TO BECKY'S LAND,"I'm not a big reader, but the shopaholic series got me hooked! Enjoyed the first 3 books and this one is not much different. Easy to read, funny, and a little boring at times. Becky is my girl! Continues to be the shopaholic that she is always been,witty and naive, getting into trouble, but always finding her way out of it with success, i wish life was that easy. This is what this series is about; transporting you to a fantasy world where no matte what you do everything turns out perfect at the end. I personally find it very entertaining. Looking forward to reading shopaholic and baby and watching the upcoming shopaholic movie!"
3,predictable yet entertaining,"After reading the previous Shopaholic books you already get a sense of what this story is going to be about, where the story will turn, and how it will all end up. That being said, it is still a very entertaining read as long as you don't mind the fact that with each passing novel and page there is less and less for you to like about Becky. Yet still, you can't help but feel for her. Shopping to her is an addiction and as she tries once again to change ger spendthrift ways you can't help but laugh and cry at the mess she gets herself into."
5,Loved it!,"I'm surprised to read some of the negative reviews. This was my favorite of the Shopaholic series--mainly because we get to see more of Luke Brandon in it. I love it when he pays her debts off (c'mon, he's a millionaire!). What a fantasy!"
3,What happen??,"Ok, I have LOVED Sophie since she hit the scene. But what the heck happen here? I'm stuck somewhere in the mid-beginning. I'm going to go back and finish it and will add to the review then, but right now I'm at a lost for words. Sophie come back!!Ok so I finally finished it...I'm still not impress and have to say that this book does not live up to her previous ones. I moved it up from 2 stars to 3 only because I'm a sucker for a happy ending and this book has ATLEAST that piece."
3,Too slow to ship,The delay in shipping annoyed me. I think ten days is ridiculous. I received another book ordered on the same day from another vendor four days earlier. I will go with the more efficient vendor in the future.
2,I want to slap Becky!,"I have not yet finished the book but I wanted to see what others thought. I don't know why I keep reading these books. I find parts amusing (which I why I keep reading them) but I really wish the character of Becky wasn't so stupid and selfish. Why would someone like Luke stick around for this? What is endearing about Becky? She is just plain clueless about life and marriage. I think she is truly the most annoying character ever. I will finish the book but honestly, I can't stand Becky."
3,What happened?,"I will not write a long review, but Becky seems to have gone from adorably, sympathetically, quirky and mildly lacking in self control to outright mentally ill. Kinsella's first two were clever and Becky was adorable but she seems to have just gone insane. It is not so much fun, as it is cringe inducing. The books still have their funny, lovable, moments, but overall Becky has gone from a great character I could relate to to a complete flake with a dangerous impulse control disorder, whom refuses to learn a lesson. This is a Shopaholic book with a seriously dark underbelly. This is the ""Becky goes insane"" version and it goes far beyond the shopping obession. Case in point, the ""Sisterhood"" t-shirt."
3,Great to see Becky Back!,"Another chronicle in the saga of Rebecca Bloomwood....the sister twist is a bit far-fetched, and you just want to shoot Luke (the stupid husband!) but it's the thoughts that just pop into Rebecca's head that make you howl with laughter. It's a good thing there has been a break since the last book, because she is starting to get a bit tired and repetitive....the end of the book does leave LOADS of room for the next installment. Kinsella should stick with creating new characters that are equally as witty (like Can You Keep A Secret?). Still, a GREAT summer read! I bought it on-line from the UK because I couldn't wait and then read it in one day!"
3,I just read it bcuz it was next in the series.,"After reading Shopaholic Ties the Knot, I just knew the next book would be Shopaholic Has a Baby. So I was surprised to learn it was Shopaholic and Sister. Originally the plot sounded funny.... having a sister that doesn't like to shop. But the actual plot was just average. I'm really not sure what to say about this book. It wasn't entirely bad, but wasn't entirely good either. If you've read the other books in the series, I'd say just read this one bcuz Jess may appear again in the follow-up book. However, please just check it out from the library. Or wait until it comes out in paperback. Better yet, buy it in paperback from a used book store."
4,"light, funny, entertaining","I have read all of Ms. Kinsella's books. I have enjoyed all of them and ususally I read them on long airline flights. This last book although ejoyable makes Becky fit more the traditional model of airheaded, dependeant wife. It made me slightly uncomforatble since I wouldn't want this series to become a dime store, chick- lit series. Luckily later in the book Becky's previous ""intelligent"" credentials are not just -discussed but also utilized. This is fun reading not to be taken too seriously but I still want Becky to reclaim her voice within her maariiage to a multimillionarire."
2,It was good ...,"I love Sophie Kinsella books so I was extremely happy when I heard that Shopaholic & Sister was coming out. I even pre-ordered it. It only took 3 days to read, but I was a little disappointed. The other 3 books in the series were laugh out loud funny, and I thought that this one was just off the mark. It won't keep me from reading any more in the series (if there are any... PLEASE) I love Bex and Suze and Luke... Please keep them coming, but leave Jess out of it!"
2,The worst of all shopaholics,"This is the worst of the series so far. One question, can Becky Bloomwood get any dumber? In ""Confession"", I assumed the auther was having fun with the personality. It was fresh and cute. As Becky's life progressed, her IQ was dropping from one book to the next. She becomes the typical ""air-head"". It seems that all she knows is nothing else but fashion (don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Harvey Nicks and Harrods too). Her life seems to be flat and uninteresting. Sophie Kinsella may want to do more research if she wants to write the 5th shopaholic. It is very evidental that she has been taken over by a lot of British writers who can come up with better plots and characters.If you like the same stylish/ modern British chiklit, you can try Helen Dunne or Clare Naylor. Their writings are way better than Kinsella's. If you really want to read this book, wait for the mass market copy."
2,"After three books, it gets to be TOO MUCH!","The first books were great, simply because they were the first of their kind. Another lovable clueless English chick, ala Bridget Jones. But after three books on the same note, full of Becky's shallow character and stupidity, i just couldn't take it anymore.Note to Sophie Kinsella - time to stop with the ""Shopaholic"" series while you're ahead. I know similar to Becky one-brain cell women will gobble them up as long as they're written, but broaden your horizons a bit and dig deeper."
2,Tired of Becky !,"I agree with Rainforest's review...I loved the 2 first books of this series, 3rd one was ""ok""....this one is simply boring...To be honest, you get bored with Becky's addiction to shopping, her blunders,...I even found her very, very stupid!...I'll read the latest books by Sophie KInsella, with the ""other character"", hoping that she will be more interesting than Becky, and that I will enjoy reading these books as much as I enjoyed the first stories of ""shopaholic""."
2,Becky Bloomwood is Maxed Out,"I enjoyed the first couple of the Shopaholic series, but the rest just deteriorated in quality and fun. Shopaholic & Sister seems like a rush job, like the author was on a deadline, and slapped a few ideas together. It wasn't original and I gave up in the middle of the book. That said, I am still a big fan of Sophie Kinsella and look forward to reading her future non-shopaholic books."
3,A bit of a disappointment from Kinsella,"While Becky's adventures in this Shopaholic book weren't quite as funny, it was entertaining and a quick, mindless read.Becky finds herself saddled with an older half-sister...a sister from one of her father's previous relationships. At first, she's delighted and determined for her sister to like her. Everyone else is skeptical that they're going to get along.Disaster strikes again and again in Becky's attempts to find something--anything--in common with Jess.I'm happy to report that a happy ending did happen, however obviously forced it turned out to be."
4,if you like the other ones you'll like this too,"Okay so Becks and Luke take a year off, and literally see the world. She is happy Luke is kicking back and so tanned.Unfortunately, when she gets back from her honeymoon,lots of things have changed, Suze has just had twins and is hanging out with this uber perfect mom, who makes Becky feel unwanted.She also finds out her Dad had a thing with another woman way before she was ever thought of and she has a sister named Jess. Jess is gruff and athletic and thinks Becky is a selfish liar and doesn't even give her a chance. Becky tries to be nice,but nothing seems to work.Even worse, Luke is mad when he finds out she spent 2000 bucks on a purse.Will Jess and Becky ever make up?You will have to read,because i'm sure not going to spoil it for you."
5,outstanding,brilliant!!!love the begining and end. better then the rest of the other shopahloic series. simply enjoyed reading the entire book. the contrast of the sister was brilliantly shown.
1,Misleading,The description of the product is not clear. You expect to receive 30 great shows from the original artists. Wrong! They are recorded by other people (that you have never heard of) and they are terrible! Not worth buying.
1,Does not fit Honda Civic factory air box.,"I bought this product for my 1992 Honda Civic, because not only did it say ""this product fits your car"" when I put the make and model in at the top of the screen, it was also in the list of cars it fits. It has the same factory air box as many Civics. The filter is about an inch too wide to fit into the box. I had to cut the filter and reattach the side with silicon. Was not very happy. Look elsewhere for a K&N for your Civic, and beware of Amazon's part finder."
5,"Nice guy, great CD!","I met Roberto a few months ago on a trip to Havana. He instructed me and my college latin jazz band and was fantastic. He is one of the most talented pianist alive today and is a great guy to top it all off. A kind-hearted, friendly guy with an amazing talent--a unique blend for sure! Buy his CD!"
2,rock n roll fantasy,"I was a bit disappointed in this book, I guess it wasn't what I expected. Although she does tell some things about these bands, it was mostly about her. She toots her own horn quite a bit, takes credit for alot of the things that ac/dc did, and a few times refers to herself as ""hot"". I am glad I did not spend alot of money on it."
5,Great stories from a true Rock Fan.,"I bought this book after reading Susan Masino's AC/DC biography (well worth reading also). This book is basically stories about her interviews and run-ins with lots of great 70s bands. Some great Van Halen, Cheap Trick and Nuge stories included.What makes Susan Masino's writing so good is that it comes from a fan's perspective. She comes across as a true fan of these bands, not some journalist who is mildly interested."
2,hit or miss,"i bought one to replace the color max light bulb (one that came with the light fixture) but it died in about 1 month's time. the other light bulb (6,700K) that came with the light fixtures as well how ever is still working although it became dim. it seems the light bulb has a huge range of life from weeks to months and results may varies. im going to get these light bulbs 1 more time and this time im going to remove the acrylic cover on the light fixtureAqueon Coralife 05618 Aqualight T5 Freshwater Dual Lamp Fixture, 30-Inch(since i have glass hoods anyway) so the light bulb wont get as hot and hopefully it will live longer."
3,Great if you are rebuilding an Old Jeep,This book shows a total restoration. It may provide on a small amount of help for the shadetree mechanic.Nick
4,Good basic starting point.,I read the book end to end and I think this is a very good starting point in your restoration project. Combine this one with technical manuals for your particular model and you are well under way.It has lots of good sharp illustrations that often is missed in the work shop manuals and the accompanying texts is clear and easy to understand.If I should choose five books to have on the shelf about my car this is one of them.
3,"Obviously amateurish writing, but still a good read","I bought this book at a fair knowing nothing about it or the author. Read it in two sittings, and while this book is obviously amateur in it's storytelling and charactization, the actual storyline is a good one. I stayed interested...and really that's good enough for me. I wouldn't recommend paying too much money to get this book but if you ever come across it it's worth the time."
2,"Not so great, but worth a visit to the library","While the plot line of this book is pretty interesting, in some places, it just falls flat. For instance, I think a lot of things are way too easy for Leora, and that people are also too willing to believe her story. For people who are oppressed and ready to get into a war, they are unrealistically trusting of her, and her ""predictions"" which they buy into almost immediately. I also thought Leora was a very pale character, with not a lot of life. I am a very avid reader, and I like almost everything I read, so the fact that I disliked this so much is a surprise even to me. However, it is an amusing read, and like I've previously stated, the plot line is pretty good. Worth getting from a friend or the library, but use your book money to buy Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials instead."
5,overlooked,"This is my favorite book but nobody has ever heard of it! I have no clue why people look over this book. Leora has a bad hand and in this book taking place in the future people like her are sent away. She has visions and she ends up having to go on an incredible journey and do things people just don't do then. I would recommend this book to any teen or pre-teen. I usually don't like action, but this is such a cool story that you won't forget anytime soon!"
2,Disappointing,"The work just isn't that well written. And yes, I know it's designed for children, but children's books can, and should be, extraordinarily well written. But nothing pulls you into this child's life. The author portrays the feeling of trying to create magic, and being quite unsuccessful at it. In the end the listener is struck with wonder that everything worked together, with multiple deus ex machinas. And the voice of Kate Forbes is not only sickly-sweet, but lacks character range.Still, children will likely enjoy it, and it's something to stick in the car as you are driving on a long trip. It's just not good literature."
1,Could have been better,"I had decided to read this book for a book report a while ago. I was mostly inspired by the original plot to read it, however, I was disappointed by the rushed writing and lack of descriptions of characters and locations. Throughout the book, even the main character does not have a distinct age, physical appearance, or personality (unless you own the paperback copy with her on the cover). And although she does have the power of clairvoyance, most of the story is way too predictable. I would recommend this for young children who do not see such points as important, but for older readers, though, I think you should pass this one up."
1,It broke.,"I drink about 150 bottles of wine per year. I've been using ""screwpull"" style corkscrews like this one since the 1980's. They are simple and easy to use.I paid more than I should have for this one, then the dern thing went and broke after only 50 bottles or so! What's up with that? The metal screw separated from the plastic handle.Now I'm using the Screwpull S1015-31 Table Corkscrew. After 150 bottles or so it works like it should with no signs of cracking or breaking.Edit (three years later) - still using my same Screwpull. Works like a charm. Works like new. I still don't understand how a big outfit like Metrokane could have gotten wrong this simplest of cork pullers. I see that Screwpull has come up with a new version that has a red plastic ball at the top of the screw to make it easier to remove the cork from the auger. A solution to a non-existent problem. But maybe it will help them to sell a few more."
5,A masterpiece,Leo Gandelman is a musician's musician. His lack of commercial influence makes this a pure masterpiece which I would rather listen to than write about.
5,easy writer,These pens are great. Not my style normally but neer written with anything so easy before. They just flow along the page.
1,I wanted to love it,"I really wanted to love this book and bought it because I have heard him speak before and he does seem enlightened. With that said, this book is impossibly hard to follow, so I ultimately gave up on it. I couldn't recommend it in good faith."
4,enlightening,"obviously i feel that the information given is enlightening and provokes much thought; however, it may be a bit over my head. i will re-read the book and perhaps the second time it will sink in better. but i intend to investigate further and read more into buddhism and His Holiness The Dalai Lama."
3,Teaching What They've Been Taught?,"I read (actually, couldn’t finish) the Dalai Lama’s book, in conjunction with the Guy Newland book, and the same criticisms hold: I’m not very impressed with these Tibetan[?] deeply-dualistic schema of ‘logical’ analysis-paralysis, which produce essentially fake, 'straw dog' concepts, like “Ultimate Reality” and “Conventional Reality”, “Real” and “Un-Real”, etc.The logic employed and explanation offered is tautological, and never pushed beyond that boundary, in thinking and understanding.There is a very strong feeling here that something is being ‘taught’ (and believed), by someone who is teaching what they have themselves been taught.And, I have a huge respect and admiration for this Dali Lama, as a person, and a role."
2,Author not best choice for reading Audio Book,"With all due respect Jeffrey, Ph.D. Hopkins' voice, tone and delivery detracts from the message. It is monotone and makes an enlightening subject boring by virtue of the delivery. I have three [3] other audio books by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, 'Live in a better way', 'The art of Happiness', and 'The art of Happiness at work' and those are more engaging.An audio book must deliver more than just the spoken word, it should pull the listener in. I wished he had used someone else to deliver the audio book. A hard listen for me despite the subject matter. The absence of the `Tibetan accent' as it were is a factor which could be over looked if Jeffrey, Ph.D. Hopkins' tone had some life; something to feel. ZZZZZzzzzz...."
5,Detachment as a way to authenticity,Emotions distort reality of self and others. Buddhism is a practice and a religion that offers a way out of illusion (Mara). The Dalai Lama brings forth his own wisdom as a world soul teacher immersed in Tibetan Buddhism. A wonderful guide on getting out of your own way.
5,A master of explanation,"After having gotten more deeply into the teachings I now realize what a master of explanation His Holiness is. All his books from simple to complex are amazing in the way they sense the confusion in us and answer our questions as we go. In other words, he can tailor his teachings to all levels. THIS book is easy to understand And yet covers the deeper more complex truths. IT is only a start. I am reading everything I can get by him but especially his treatises on the Dharma. This is a small book, easy to read and go back over, and carry in your bag. He is an amazing teacher. I did not realize how clear he is until I read harder books then hear him go over and over again the same things in a million different ways until we get it. Any book by him is a great blessing to have the grace to read."
4,Great price and fine quality,Can't beat the price for 50ft of quality component cable; I could rate this five stars probably but somehow I suppose there has got to be a better cable but I'm sure it would cost 3 times as much (at least).
1,Interference,"I bought this cable, but it suffered from an unacceptable amount of interference. Faint green and purple rolling bands ruined my picture. Replacing it with a shorter cable fixed the problem.Don't buy a longer cable than you need, and consider spending a little more for a higher quality wire if you need all 50 feet."
4,"Aww, come on haters, leave 'em alone.","Of course the CD isn't another Horroscope... if you want another Horroscope, go buy another copy. I've been an Eve 6 fan since their self titled, (which I absolutely adore) all the way up through... they haven't disappointed me yet. Catchy lyrics and slick guitar riffs... I'm hooked. My personal faves are ""Bring The Night On"", ""Think Twice"", ""Good Lives"" and ""Hokis""... and I could do without ""Hey Montana."" **shudders** Ewww. But, hey, nobody's perfect. Minus that one song, the rest rock out. Download ""Bring The Night On"" and ""Think Twice"" if you haven't yet, then go out and buy the CD. It rocks."
5,WOW!!,"I was blown away! I used to think of Eve 6 as kind of a boy band or something after hearing that song about ""Here's to the Night"". Boy was I wrong. The second I heard ""Think Twice"", I was hooked. These guys are awsome. And on this album they seem to have gotten a little more technical. They have some really nice acoustic songs and the rythem at which they flow is amazing. If you like rock, pop, rap, whatever, you will like Eve 6. They are great. I can stick this album in and never take it out of the CD player. I would suggest any of Eve 6's albums, but this one is easily the best."
4,Well worth the wait.,"Very underrated and unappreciated by radio and video...and that's why we like it. A great follow up to Horrorscope. The album seems more mature and introspective as the band seems to tinker with their sound without radically changing what we expect from them (Listen to Hey Montana!) They find fresh approaches to the subject matter of their songs. Melodies and lyrics are intelligent and fun yet serious at the same time. Check out the following songs: Arch Drive Goodbye, Girlfriend, Good Lives, Friend of Mine, Think Twice, Hokis...okay, okay, just buy the c.d., have a beer, and enjoy."
5,2nd To None!!,"After hearing their first album, I was very impressed. After waiting for more than 2 years for the release of ""Horrorscope"", I was even more impressed. Then, waiting mor than 3 more years for the follow-up, I never thought that these 3 could outdo themselves. Boy, was I wrong! This album brings out all the good aspects that these 3 talented guys possess. ""Think Twice"" is a solid first single. ""Good Lives"" rocks from the opening note, as does ""Bring The Night On."" My personal favorite is ""Arch Drive Goodbye."" While I'm not sure what the title means, I do know that after a slow beginning, this song picks up and just flows perfectly. I can't get enough of ""It's All In Your Head,"" and once you listen, you'll understand just why."
4,The Album After the Dawn and Before the Dusk,"Eve 6's first major hit, Inside Out, conjoured up images of an excited 15-year-old high-school guy who had just taken one too many Xanax- it gave you a feeling of excess energy complimented by inane, rose-tinted babbling. Horrorscope, though highly regarded by many Eve 6 fans, shows signs of the Billy Corgan slide into an equivocal mediocrity with hints of electonica (especially notable on Here's to the Night) that has lost its emotional flavor. Its All In Your Head has lost the extra Xanax of the first two albums in favor of a more defined, varied, and deeper emotional statement well-supported by intelligent lyrics and commendable musicianship, a statement that has been lost in Horrorscope, in favor of a more soma-induced please-all, which still contains the musicianship but lacks in the emotional and intelligent arenas."
2,What has happened to this band?,"I've been a huge Eve 6 fan ever since purchasing their debut album a few years ago. Out of all the albums the band has released, Horrorscope is my favorite. I hate to say it, but I'm very disappointed with this new album. It has three of four decent songs, but the rest is pretty dull. Horrorscope had clever songwriting with huge hooks, but this new material is boring. This CD will probably be in the cheap bin at the music store before too much longer. Of course, music tastes are subjective, and I know a lot of people really like this album. But for me, I just can't get into it."
3,Departure from the normal path,"What's the best way to describe Eve 6's latest CD? To sum it up, it's a departure from the previous two CDs. It has a bit of a different feel to it, a slower, more depressing feel. Where Horrorscope had a few that weren't depressing, It's All In Your Head has none that aren't. There is a lot less guitar with distortion, and the acoustics have taken over about a fourth of the tracks. If you're looking for the faster and less depressing music of Eve 6, or the classic sound of Eve 6, steer clear."
4,EVE 6 Grows up,"This cd is incredible. Their lyrics are much more mature than their last album, ""Horrorscope"". The song topics range from suicide, cheating lovers, and the corruption of big city. Every song is a sing-along pumped with awesome guitar riffs and Max Collin's smooth voice. ""Hey Montana"" is one of the most unique songs on the cd. It sounds like a campfire song. The others like the radio single ""Think Twice"" are classic EVE 6 rock songs with some punk sprinkled in. Die hard EVE 6 fans will definitly be satisfied with this album. This cd is also good for people who are new to EVE 6's music. Bottom Line: BUY IT, IT'S WORTH THE MONEY!"
4,Still kicken,"If you thought Eve6's first 3 albums were good (eleventeen, self titled, Horrorscope) then you'll love this one. It has all the power and energy as the first ones with a mix of new sounds put in.Run out and buy this CD!!"
4,Third CD and Still Rocking,"As a huge Eve 6 fan I can be a bit biased, but this third CD is as awesome as the first two. Their first single, ""Think Twice"" will get you listening to the CD, but the lyrics of ""Good Lives"", ""Bring the Night On"" and ""Friend of Mine"" will remind you why the CD rocks. It's a different sound than their debut CD and ""Horrorscope"", but the main point is that they've come farther along as a band and it shows in their arrangement and lyrics. The CD also comes with some cool interviews and videos. Highly recommended for all Eve 6 fans and for those looking for some real rock with a little punk."
3,What Happened?,"I have to ask, what happened to the band! All the songs of this CD sound depressed. One of the reason I enjoyed EVE 6 so much is because of their upbeat music. Overall the music itself isn't bad, still very creative, but I am dissapointed with the new CD."
4,Eve 6 is back,"Wow, I really didn't know what happen to them after Horoscope. Not saying it (Horoscope) was bad, but I didn't think it lived up to their debut album. Eve's new album, it's all in your head is worth adding to your album collection. It totally shows off Eve's style at its best. For those of you that aren't really familar with their style I would put it under soft rock. Upbeat like 3rd Eye Blind with the mellow side of Matchbox 20."
4,"New style, still way good","While their new CD steps away from their old style, Eve 6 has put out some solid new music. Old Eve 6 fans and new ones alike can find something they like on Its All In Your Head. Still Eve 6, a little bit older, a little bit wiser, still good music."
3,No wonder its only eight friggen bucks @ the store,"The CD is alright, don't get me wrong, but when I listened to think twice for the first time a while ago I thought this Cd would be amazing....Well, it isnt. ""Hey Montana"" is pretty good, so is ""Think Twice"", and ""Bring the Night on"". But the rest of the cd is just ""meh"". They need some more songs like ""The Open Road Song"" and ""Promise"", I think songs like that would bring this CD from a ""meh"" to a ""Sweeeeeeeeet"""
1,BOOO!,after hearing think twice i figured id go out and get the eve 6 cd. never have i wasted 10 bucks worse. this album flat out sucks. one good song is think twice. the rest of the songs are so bad i thought about wiping my a** with the cd. i finnally threw it out. dont buy the cd!
2,Lost directions,"I got Horrorscope for free two years ago. Great stuff. So good I went out and bought the self titled album thinking this band was awesome. There were some good tracks mostly mindless drivel.I pre-ordered Its All In Your Head. I was thinking good, better, best? Not so much. The band seemed to lose what it was and what it wants to be.I see this album as a mix of styles none of which grab me hard. Musical direction is lost. There seems to be three bands playing on this album. The crafty lyrics are there in part but not used as well. Catchy toe-tapping beats are gone too. Guitars seem mis-represented.Here are the track that make this album worth the price of used: Think Twice, At Least We're Dreaming, Arch Drive Goodbye.The rest is fair to partly cloudly at best."
1,Bloody awful.,"I couldn't even pay attention to what the narrator was saying; the costumes and Halloween quality wigs were SO awful, ESPECIALLY the ""redheaded"" one...it made me sad and embarrassed- they couldn't even get a REAL red-haired man or woman actor to participate, or the budget to spend on a wig that didn't look like it was stolen from Carrot Top. And the fact that it looked like it kept slipping down further onto his face....c'mon. It was disappointing, and unwatchable- I threw it away in disgust. And as a Celt, I love sex, but HATED this farce of a production."
4,Better than the title and cover picture implies,"This is not a sex tape, although you could hardly tell that from the way this DVD advertizes it's self. I bet there are a lot of people who got it thinking it was a skin flick with ""Celtic"" trappings! NOT. It says some very interesting things about sexual mores in Ireland before and after the Catholic church forced it's ""better to marry than burn"" views on the Celts. What convoluted power hungry old esthetics those priests must have been...and they created a Catholic God in their image! One who got off on Supressing sexual urges, but was still obcessed with sex, their own and everyone elses. No wonder confession was invented!"
5,"always love shiseido,any product work for me well","as esthetitian can recomended it for woman and man as well ,quality of products very hight. Retinol mask work very good for mature and tired skin."
4,Great collection- great music- ??? singing!!,"This SAC cd is the way to go- a great collection spanning their career with most of the highlights from their prime moments. Really interesting arrangments- perhaps some of the most accessible pyschedelic stuff from the sixties. The only downfall of this band is they never had strong vocalists- they get by on the skin of their teeth and with better vocalist/vocalists the material would even be more memorable but all in all theres a charm in the imperfection. Known mostly for ""incense"" the SAC were more than one hit. These songs showcase a solid experimental band with a grasp of nabbing the best of the sixties and using it their songwriting. Plus they were the house band in the cult classic Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and wrote a song and performed in Jack Nicholsons ""Pysche-Out"". Sixties flowerpop at its best!"
3,As best as can be expected,"Well seeing as this is a required textbook, this is actually pretty good. I have been using the series and I can now say that I can speak russian! But of course that was with being enrolled in an actual university russian course. I never found this book useless and since I can't possibly fathom why anyone would buy it without it being a required text I don't understand why everyone thinks it is so horrible, its hilarious if anything! Also I thought it was good that Amazon sold it so much cheaper than my university's bookstore. And this is the first book in this series for beginning russian."
3,Don't Bother,"It's not worth the wait or the money - - it is also the second set in a series; not for beginners. If you want a good introduction to Russian, try ""Express Track to Russian,"" it's worth the money."
5,BS,"To all you haters, who say this book is no good. Check out the Dennis and Tanya stuff, hell i didnt even speak the language, or have any interest in it, but the tape is good. Remember when the fat guy's button flew off his shirt? remember Tanya's constant hair changes? Priceless. What about the time the letter got knocked behind the couch and they found it under a chair? Uh! What about that classic moment. Stop hating.Hey does anyone know Fred White, aka Dennis I am trying to contact him to star in a sequel. I am thinking about calling it ""Dennis and Tanya: Two Fools in the Ukraine""well anywayNote: When looking at my review nearly two years later, I decided to pop old Dennis and Tanya in my VCR. All I have to say is yup, still got the magic.Yet another year later, and by god, it is out of print! Hey if you teach russian, do yourself a favor, teach, snag a couple copies will you already!"
1,Not worth the time of money,The text does not do a good job in any aspect of teaching the russian language.
2,A lot better in-studio live CD choices out there.,"Over the past three years, I have been able to build a collection of over 75 live, in-studio recorded CDs.WAAF has three good acoustic songs, and two moderately intersting live recordings. The bulk of the CD content is made up of the WAAF DJ's promotional ramblings.There are a lot better choices available from stations like KNND in Seattle, Y100 in Philly, Long Island's WLIR, etc.These other choices cost the same, but include an average of 16 or 17 good recordings."
5,I use this pen all the time.,"This pen stays next to my checkbook. Its easy to see because of the color and also matches my car. It also writes so incredibly smooth. Think about it, this was cutting edge tech back when it went to space. Its basically military grade. Its strong and reliable. Get yourself one."
1,Will not buy again.,Honestly I bought one of these guys after watching an episode of Seinfeld and everyone made a big deal on how it writes upside down. It's not that impressive. Plus it's not my style of pen.I prefer the Zebra Spiral pen with its ergonomic barrel design.
4,good brain teasers,Again a very clever group of puzzles which are fun for the intelligent person with mathematical skills. Highly recommended.Peter Schrag
4,"Good history, good modelling!","In the usual CAMPAIGN format, but double sized, this book follows the whole Gettysburg campaign, starting with the Army of Northern Virginia ""invasion"" up to their retreat.There are the standard ""3D"" maps showing the actual battle, day by day, and *lots* of period photographs, as well as modern day drawings.For modellers (my case!) there is plenty of material for uniforms, weaponry, and dioramas. Wargamers also get some attention.I heartily recommend all of the Civil War Osprey Campaign books: Antietam, Fredericksburg, Manassas, and so on!"
3,"Good, but Disappointing","I enjoy listening to this CD, but it's a little disappointing. I hope high hopes after watching the movie and seeing the ad for the CD at the end of it. But, the music I received didn't quite match up to my expectations. Further, the music on the disc itself isn't even in the same order as the list on the jewel case."
4,Great CD!,"With all the excitement in the christian community regarding the Left Behind series, this cd is a wonderful collection of cutting edge christian rock songs that should appeal not only to the christian community, but to everyone, and add to the fervor of the movie release."
4,Theme Song Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I saw the Movie and I imediatly wanted to get the soundtrack,which i did...Although,When I got it I wanted to hear the theme song,but on the back it said it was #1-Its really #15,the real #1 is ""Never Been Unloved""....I would say thats the only problem,and its not really that important....I think the best songs are:""Left behind"",""No Fear"",""Fly"",""Believer"",""All The Way To Heaven"",""After All""........those are all really great songs and they go great with the movie!!!!I think You will really enjoy this CD-and the Left behind Movie,too!"
3,Silently Seduced,"This book was good as it explained the syndrome of covert incest well, however it was not quite as good as another title called ""What to do when a parent's love rules your life"" by Patricia Love.The author appeared to have some personal experience with the syndrome and hence it did not come accross as objective Dr Love's book.However it was still well worth a read if you or someone you know is affected by covert incest."
5,Sielenty Seduced: When Parents Make Their Children Partners,"We in the helping profesions often over look emotional incest in children and adults. This book clearly outlines and provides examples of emotional abouse. It is so easy to overly rely on our children to fill the ""absent parent"" roll. Not only does this book show the cases clearly and effectivly it follows the child to adulthood. It offers the longterm dammage that is enevetable.Kit Allan, LSW"
4,The Parent-child Dynamics of Covert Incest,"I purchased this book to use clinically, however found it personally enlightening as well. It is fairly simple to read, but the message belies the book's easy readability. The book focuses on covert incest, as the title suggests, and will probably not be very beneficial for overt incest survivors seeking answers. A client of mine borrowed the book and reported that little pertained to her. This does not mean, however that the parent-child dynamics involved in covert incest can't also exist in a more physically/sexually abusive relationship. I recommend this book for clinicans and survivors."
3,It's OK,"I thought the arms of the lamp would be more flexible and could be straightened or curved, or put in whatever position you want. But no, it's curled metal that you have to unfurl and can't adjust it too much.The glass sconces are just glass/plastic (?) balls with a hole in it. I thought they would be little lamp shades.I haven't bought light bulbs for it yet so I don't know how it looks turned on. Overall it's fine. I paid around $60 for it, and I think that was a little too much."
1,Trouble,This DVD has the eppisode where they call the dragon and vegeta wishes for imortality...does he get his wish granted...you have to buy this to find out. Only buy this DVD if you love American DBZ I don't so I say wait for the subbed DVD.
2,Please don't buy this book,"The author knows python, but the book itself is not worth it. It just contains lots of code snippet and little explanation.The two books that I'll recommend are ""Python Essential Reference"" by David M. Beazley (a second edition is coming soon) and ""Core Python"" by Wesley Chun."
3,what kind of main event was that?,"okay, for one thing it is called the royal rumble so the royal rumble should be the main event not some stupid performance from mark henry.MATCH ONE:cruier wait open invitaional,great high flying matchthe cruiser weights rock but obviously vince mcmahon dosent think so. 8/10MATCH TWO: Mickie James vs Ashley Trish as special ref,it was okay but Ashly is hot but she cant wrestle the best part was the ending when it ended 4/10Match THREE: Okay the bogey man cant wrestle. He is entertaining but not ion matches. Why stick a good wrestler such as JBL in the ring with some freak. I dont get it. 5/10MATCH FOUR:Royal Rumblew match, this was awesome and even better since Rey wonthis was the best match of the night. If this was the Main event i would give the ppv 5 stars instead of 3. 9/10Match FIVE: John Cena vs. Edge, It was good but not great7/10Match SIX: Mark Henry VS. Kurt Angle WHY put some 1 as bad as Mark Henry at the main event of such a big ppv why! 4/10"

3,A Mediocre Royal Rumble - Crappy Main Events!,"I always love the Royal Rumble, for the unique match by itself, and the stakes are high. But this year's RR was average. The end wasnt exciting, and not much emphasis on the drawn numbers, and not much feud starter for WM22 as did Royal Rumble the past 2 years.The main event sucks. Though the RAW main event was pretty decent(for a Cena match), it was a letdown that Edge lost. But that just makes HHH vs. Cena for WM22's main event which is sweet. Angle vs. Henry plainly sucks! I mean thats a SmackDown! match for cryin' out loud, and if its not enough, they made it the last match of the night(should have been the RR)! I guess its cuz its for the ""shocker"" at the end, which again, could have been done in SD!.The other matches are so so. Dont expect something great. But if you still want to collect WWE DVDs, this aint bad, if you want to collect only the good ones, get another, maybe RR from the past 2 years as I said."
1,John Cena sucks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,listen I am not going to review this ppv all I am going to say is John Cena is the worst champion how is he even a wrestler he just gets his ass kicked for the entire match I admit I really liked John Cena when he was rapping because he was really good at rapping but know he doesn't rap he walks into the ring having a spaz attack but I did have a idea he might win because Edge would have had the title changed back to the way it was Vince Mcmahon has problems did you not here everyone at new Years Revolution chanting Cena Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Vince your going to lose your company if you keep John Cena as the champion so please make him lose to HHH at WM 22.
1,DUDE CENA IS GONNA WIN @ WRESTLEMANIA 22,"He is undefeated at WM!-two years in a row,plus winning a chapionship-WWE are gonna turn him in2 a WrestleMania god-like UnderTaker who is also undefaeted at WM, 13-0.Triple H may win the WWE Title at BackLash in the rematch though-but not WrestleMania.Thats the problem with wrestling today-all the special events are linear.Hopefully Orton will get a shot against the World Heavyweight Champ at WM!and anyways why on earth should REY get a shot as a HEAVYWEIGHT title-when Rey weights like a feather-Plus he`s a midget the only people that should go for a heavyweight championship are(prsent wrestlers)Triple HBrock LesnarBatista(though he CAN`T WRESTLE!)John CenaRandy OrtonKurt AngleThe Rock""StoneCold"" Steve Austin.KANEUnderTakerBig ShowRikishi."
5,One You Won't Be Able To Put Down Until The Last Page!,"I simply loved the book! The reading is easy and so detailed, that your curiosity will not allow you put the book down until the last page. The characters are realistic and get into some pretty sticky situations that draw you into their world to find out ""what will happen next."" In the end, all is well in this modern-urban realistic fairy-tale."
4,Kozol has done it again,"Having read many of Kozol's previous books, I have developed a great admiration for him and his lifelong dedication to social justice and poor children, and his eloquent arguments on their behalf. I've wondered at how he has managed to spend nearly 40 years of his life in this pursuit. This book shows us why--he truly enjoys and loves the children he advocates for. Like Savage Inequalities and Amazing Grace (both must reads) the children's words themselves move you with their honesty, their innocence, and their hope. I can still see Elio moving his arms to ""catch one of God's answers to his prayers"". But this book also gives us some insight into Kozol himself--his struggles with the failing health of his parents especially. While his earlier books often were suffused with anger at the inequalities of the public education system and social framework, this book is filled with hope and joy. and a little bit of sadness too. And, surprisingly, it is just as effective."
5,It couldn't be more true...,"as a ""survior"" of the South Bronx I can only reassure the readers that Jonathans reflections of the segragation,poverety and dispair that thrives in the Bronx is sadly too true...but he is also correct in the innocence of the children of the Bronx and the one time in your life that no matte where you live or what you do...there is that special place.I never went to St. Ann's but I know plan too..after completing my degree I plan on opening a home for children in the south bronx to give them the chance, the opportunity that so many of us never had...To the ""elite"" of New York and the policy makers...may God forgive you for what you do to the children of the South Bronx..my deepest and most sincere respect go to Jonathan for such a well written book and his obvious care for these children."
2,Not my kind of book...,"I got through 1/2 of this book and I couldn't get any further. I like the stories of the children. But it didn't keep me interested. I felt a lot of the information about the neighborhoods, school district issues, and the ""political"" issues were repetitive. The relationships between the author and the children and people of the neighborhood were fine and all, but it wasn't enough to keep me reading. It was rather dull and slow."
4,Wrenching.,This book is brutally frank and wrenching in its portrayal of the children of this community. I have been inspired to purchase the book as a mother's day gift- what could be better than a book that inspires us to remember our dependencies?
1,Dull,"As a fan, I thought I could watch anything about Marvel, but not this. The questions were tired, and Stan's responses were what he has been saying for 40 or 50 years. He is a loveable and charming man (who I met as a young fan-boy), but I don't want to hear him, yet again, take near total credit for the creation of the early Marvel universe. And then there is Kevin Smith. He come off as a half-wit, not only with his insipid questions, but with his endless stream of profanities that he must think makes him sound like an adult. Even the mediocre production values would not have gotten in the way if the content were worth the time it takes to watch this DVD. If you want to see a much tighter production of Stan's reminiscences, I recommend the DVD ""Stan Lee's Mutants, Monsters & Marvels: Creating Spider-Man and Here Come the Heroes"" and his autobiography, ""Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee"", and the biography, ""Stan Lee and the Rise and Fall of the American Comic Book"" by Jordan Raphael."
4,Good buy for the comic lover,This item went well for my friend who absolutely loves comic books. It was delievered on time and came in great condition
4,"Good sprayer, would like finer spray","This is a very well-made pump up sprayer. It is much heavier duty than the ones you typically find at the larger ""box"" stores, so the quality of the sprayer itself is a ""five star"" in my opinion. I was hoping that this more ""professional"" sprayer would come with a spray head that would adjust to be fine enough to use for indoor spraying of insecticide products, similar to those used by professional pest control companies. Unfortunately, the head on the sprayer that I received is really no different than those that come standard with the cheaper sprayers, which results in more product being dispensed than desired. In addition, when adjusted to the lowest volume of spray, the head drips after spraying, which is another problem with it. I do believe this sprayer will last a long time given the quality of construction, and perhaps I can find a different spray head which will accomplish the fine mist spray that I am trying to achieve."
5,Fantastic,"This sprayer is fantastic. I had bought the big box stores sprayers and they had become pieces of garbage through the years. The last one I bought was bad from day one. This spryer is great. It is sturdy, the pump handle is sturdy, and the valve is wonderful. It is just well made. I am so impressed, I am going to purchase another one for the garden."
5,Great sprayer at a fair price,I've been using this sprayer for one week now and I am very pleased with it. It feels very solid and sprays perfectly. I am using it to spray weed killer in my flower beds and I feel it gives me good accuracy as to spray just the weeds and not my plants. Better off paying a couple bucks more for this sprayer than getting a cheap one that will only last one season.
3,over expectation,"The table itself is everything it advertised; pretty, sturdy, comfortable and the heater works fine. I would have loved this product if I didn't hate the headrest and armrest so much. The headpiece was flimsy, hard to adjust, and worst of all, can't breath through that tiny opening. Armrest, totally useless."
5,great buy,nice earrings thought they would be a little larger then they were but great buy and I wear them as everyday earrings and haven't had a problem with them
4,Ethereal recording based on spiritual themes.,"State of Grace is an ambitious project. However, the CD succeeds admirably in exuding grace. One is reminded of angels or heavenly choruses when listening to this CD. It is mostly synthesized orchestra. Schwartz has combined oboe, violin, piano and string quartet with the synth to paint a beautiful texture of grace. However, it is the use of voice that makes this project shine. Schwartz uses a single vocalist and a choir as instruments more than vocals. The exception is one of the best renditions of ""Amazing Grace"" that I have ever heard. Schwartz's soundtrack and orchestral background is evident throughout and is what makes this CD really work. Great music for reducing stress or just putting the mind and soul in a higher plane."
3,Upbeat yet soothing - good intentions but could be better!,"""State of Grace"" is an album that marries ancient music with contemporary dance beats. The marriage in ""State of Grace"" is more harmonious than his earlier works in ""Aria"" and ""Aria 2"", I do enjoy most of the songs that he includes in the album. However, I regret the work that he does with ""Miserere"" because I think he misses the 'essence' entirely. I can't feel the feelings of desperation and repentance of his version. Lisbeth Scott who sounds quite magnificent in ""Veni Redemptor Gentium"" and ""Angelica"" is also regrettable when she sings ""Be Still My Soul"" in a Tori Amos-ian style. I would prefer her to retain the gentleness of the original version.However, having spoken all of that - this album has a lot of good points as well! Soothing, but yet upbeat at the same time. ""Simple Gifts"" is so jumpy and cheerful, whereas ""State of Grace"" is mellow, and almost lamenting. I'll keep my eyes and ears open for Schwartz's future projects!"
5,Beautiful CD - Best in My Collection,"I have many New Age albums. This is my favorite. It is peaceful, yet powerful. Its instrumentals and vocals combine to produce perfection. I have had it for over a year and it is the one CD I do not tire from listening to. Buy the CD - not for the religious meaning but simply for the music! You will be glad you did!"
5,My friends have an eclectic appreciation of music genres,"And this is the only CD (of the 426 that I own) that everyone I know oohs and ahhs over. Lovely, soothing, uplifting in an unexpected way. Wonderful in the evening by candlelight. Or on a rainy day curled up with a good novel. The title may be misleading; it is not a religious-themed music sound. It is more cerebal. Very soothing. And melodic. I have bought several of these for gifts..makes a great stocking stuffer or hostess gift when someone is kind enough to invite you for drinks or dinner. A universal sound, I have given this people in New Zealand, the UK, Paris, Bulgaria, Canada...always with the same delighted resulted. Sound quality is very much like a German recording which is surprising for the price."
4,Paul Schwartz: State of Grace,"If you love great sounding music, then this cd is for you. This cd is like a massage therapy session. Very enjoyable!"
3,State of Grace,"This is not the usual quality of music from Windham Hill. Over synthesized and overblown, the music is based purely on how much layering of sound the producer could put in. The music often drowns out the voices of the singer(s). The 'saving grace' of the music is that someone along the line of putting it all together had some good intentions. The theme is beautiful, the words, if you could understand them, are beautiful. But the usual beauty of Windham Hill which highlights individual talent and skill is totally lost in this CD."
5,The story is just beginning...,"Melodic rockers, Saosin brings a new edge to the world of music. With a fantastic mix of rock and melody, this EP makes you want more from Saosin. Fans can't wait for their 2005 full length release, as I am. Saosin brings creativity to the world of music, and their passion for their work makes them work harder for a better quality of music. Saosin is by far one of the best bands out there."
2,pure cheese,"With such mind numbingly conventional songwriting and insipid homogenized production, this band is completely undeserving of any underground cred in the emo scene. This ep sounds like it was made in a confectionary factory. It's amazing how much this music sounds like Linkin Park, especially tracks 3 and 4."
3,From Surf to Psych,"The Campisi brothers took the Ramrods from the surf instrumental days to the British Invation days to American Garage to psychedelia...the 60's from one end to the other, ending as Puff. All the while blasting away at The Surf-Nantasket Beach in Massachusetts. This CD collects material previously available only on hard-to-find vintage 7"" vinyl plus unreleased material. Not the strongest material to come out of Massachusetts in the 60's, but noteworthy and nicely archived. Ya ya, she lied!"
1,Digital Frame quality,"Even though this is a bargain, the quality is terrible. The picture is horrible! Doesn't do pictures justice. Not user friendly at all. Very difficult to figure out. Over all: I would not reccommend this product to anyone b/c the quality of the picture is horrible. YOu could barely see the pics I loaded up. And, you can't plug it directly into you computer to load pics and you can't use a pin drive either. You need a digital camera memory card which it fails to tell you that you need.over all: badbadbad,..."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I was very disappointed in this item. The quality of the displayed pictures -- both in resolution and color, was horrible. Like the other reviewers said, the pictures have a yellow tint that you cannot correct with the frame's controls. I would not recommend this product."
1,"Horrible, very poorly made","I thought I just got bad one, but judging from the other reviews it is this product The screen is either in a really weird purple and yellow hue or just blck and white, also it is off center the same way that a crt monitor looks if you mess with its settings, also the picture was really fuzzy, althought the actual frame was nice looking"
3,Digital Picture Frame,Not found it very easy to use and the picture is nt as good as I would have hoped. Picture is grainy and color is weird.
5,Excellent!,"We have enjoyed this beautiful and insightful book. Fr. Guissani never ceases to amaze me at how our human condition, faith, belief, and life correlate into something so magnificent and deeply experienced."
4,Weird...,"This book is quite good, and has an acceptable storyline. But the stuff about the Sario Rip thingymajig was a little confusing. Although not the best of books, this was a very good story."
1,Uck,"I love Animorphs and have read up to #13 and Andilite Chronicals #3 (as of 12-4-97), but this one was my least favorite. Most the books start off by the character morphing, but in this book it started out with square dancing! There wasn't all that much of a plot, KAA must of been at the deadline to send this book in and had to write it real fast or something, because it was very short. Uck, I didn't like this one!"
5,I think that Animorphs is a great book series.,"I think that The Alien (#8) is the best book in the series so far. I think this because it has a plot, good setting, action and adventure. Ax is a really cool character once you see his point of view and what hardships he faces. I can't wait to finish #9 The Secret. Animorphs are the best series for kids and adults. I hope that you enjoy reading Animorphs as much as I do"
4,somtimes confusing,"This book was the third Animorphs book I read. At some points it was confusing, but it was a good book. It started when a next-generation Bug fighter crashed into a Safeway. human-Controllers are cleaning up the mess. The Animorphs morph flies and steal the Bug fighter. But it causes a time disortation, and the Animorphs are in the past eight hours. when they reach the time that the time disortation happened, both Jakes will dissappper. Read the book to learn the ending!"
1,Stupidest ANIMORPH I've ever read,"Be wary of buying the book. I bought the book and read it. I didn't like it. It was the first ANIMORPHS book I read in one day but it wasn't very good. When I finnished I said, ""If I wasn't buying the book just to read it then I would have wasted my lawn mowing money."" I buy the books to collect and to read. But did you know that this book is the author's least favorite book in her series? I'm a little picky on my ratings on books but 75% of what I think comes from the ending, which is sooo stupid. I won't tell it to you though, just in case you haven't read it. If you want to read it to see if it really is that bad, check it out from the library. If you're buying it to collect as well, then that's okay. I guess that this book is as bad as what people thought of Alternamorphs (I haven't read that yet). Although the book has some importance when you get to MEGAMORPHS #2, but that book explains the principal well enough."
5,What a great book!,"If you like Animorphs or the rain forest, this is the book for you! It all starts when Jake has these weird flashes, like he's in the rain forest or something, then......well, I'll let you read it for yourself. =P"
3,Not bad Not great,This book is a little stupid. It takes a while to read. Even then you have to read it twice to semi-understand it. Basically do not start your series with this book. Only buy it if your a die-hard animorph fan.
5,Exciting. Gripping. You won't want to let go!,It is a cool book with lots of action towards the end My favourite part is when Jake hurls the spear at the Lerdethak! A truly suspensive book. Cudos to K.A. Applegate.
2,you get what you pay for,"Works fine, but once you plug it in take all the space. Can not plug in anything else. One of them turns on and off by itself sometimes. Can not program one switch to control all of them. Must be separate.Battery is very weird and had hard time to fit it in the remote. Wonder if will be able to find replacement.But for the price is ok."
3,Quit At Once,"I bought the three outlet set and it worked very well for about two years. For some as yet unexplained reason, all three connected to different outlets failed, at once. I unplugged the lights from the units and the lights worked. No power lights showing the unit was on for any of them. Very weird. I changed the remote battery. I will order it again because I like the product."
1,Extremely poor soldering/manufacturing.,"I have been using two of the remote receivers relay switch for almost two months now. I went to use the third receiver relay switch and it burned out the first day of use. I disassembled the receivers relay switch and it was obvious why, low quality and faulty soldering during manufacturing. I have inspected the other two receivers relay switch and have made some minor repairs which should extend the life of the product. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE USE OF THIS PRODUCT."
1,poor quality,"Handy device, but the remote doesn't pickup worth crap! All 3 are in the same room, (which is a small living room), and #1 picks up pretty good, #2 picks up pretty poorly and # 3 is terrible! On # 2 and #3 you will have to try several times before they will come on or go off! However, I have a Skylink remote outlet, (also available at Amazon), which picks up the remote signal good! I never had a problem out of it so it is a much better product, but the downside is it only has 1 outlet."
1,NOT recommended,This didn't work right out of the box. One of the modules didn't operate. After 1 week another module went dead. They sent a replacement for the first module but after the second died I requested a refund. I would NOT recommend this item.
4,Pretty good for the price,"I bought this from Amazon for around $25 bucks and it seems worth the price. 3 switches turn on and off lights from a conveniently small remote.Pros: I can now turn on and off lights from one locations and independantly of each other. Also the remote switches are a nice clicky style instead of the soft rubbery style. Just a personal preference.Cons: As with any radio device, placement of the transceivers is key. The tiny remote might not be able to go through large pieces of furniture or areas with high radio activity (like around wireless networking areas). Though, with just moving the remote around a bit you should be able to find a sweet spot. Not a deal breaker for me but maybe for some. Also, the Transceivers were a lot bulkier than I imagined."
3,Flaky,"(Purchased on eBay.)I used one of the outlets in this 3-outlet set for several months and it worked fine. Then one day it quit working unless you had the transmitter a couple of feet away. I swapped it out for another one of the remote outlets and it's working fine right now at a distance of about 60 feet. When these things work, they really work great. They work at a long distance and they can switch a lot of power, although my application is only two, 100-watt flood lights.I disassembled the bad one to see if I could see anything obviously wrong. Everything seems well built; the components seem to be high quality, all the soldier joints look good. Nothing looks burned. A wild guess at the problem is that a component is operating on the edge and eventually goes out -- maybe one of the transistors. I dunno, I'm just guessing.Anyway, I like these so much, I'm going to buy another set (from Amazon this time) and see what happens."
4,Works well -- but a little large,"This product seems to work well. The only criticism is that the units you plug into the outlet are very large and, depending on the type of the second plug you try to use in that outlet, it may not fit when the control unit is in place."
3,"it works, but . . .","Yeah, it works. The caveat is that you have to be in a direct line of sight for the remote to catch. Don't expect to hide that plug behind the TV or cabinet. But, like I said . . . it does work across our 15ft of living room space."
3,"WORKS WELL, well, kind of!","Received the DZI EZ Outlet Remote in good shape. It is easy to install and use. However, the third switch, does not have the range that the first two do. I have placed the outlets in such a manner that the drawback doesn't create a problem for me. With a clear unobstructed view from the remote to the outlets, all seems to work reasonable well. With obstacles in the way, it does not function as well. It may be simply that there is some minor problem with the unit but since I easily get around the problem by particular placement of the remotes, it is not worth the time and effort to return the unit for replacement."
1,Doesn't work,"Love the idea, but it won't work behind furniture. Unfortunately I threw the packing material away so I can't return or exchange this item."
1,misleading,"these do not work together in multiple configuration as the manufacturing website states - the ones that were sent to me do not work together at all - also say they work through walls, etc. however, they do not work through people - you cannot stand between the switch and the outlet. Many times it takes several times switching on and off.The company which distributes this product for Amazon does not respond to emails and also misleads about the shipping - stating that they ship STANDARD when what they are doing is using the much cheaper BASIC shipping from UPS, while still charging you the approximate cost it would be for STANDARD.Watch out for this distributor, I was very unhappy with this situation completely.RickLees Summit, MO"
2,superswitch,Works great as described but upon a plus one year use two of my wall receivers did burned out. Both receivers toasted at the same place.
4,EZ Outlet Remote (3 outlets),"I used the remotes in three different places. One controlled the pumpkin in the front window. The second, controled the witch on my kitchen counter. The third controls a waterfall on a table with a very hard to reach outlet. The waterall does not have a switch and requires unplugging by hand. This remote outlet was perfect for all three places. I did not have to go around the house turning things off before I went to bed. I plan on using the remotes for Christmas decorations as well.DSI EZ Outlet Remote (3 Outlets)"
2,Don't waste your money!,"I purchased two sets of the remotes. The first set lasted just a couple of weeks over the guarantee, then the middle one stopped working. The second lasted just short of that when the top one stopped working. Sending them back, packing, driving to the post office, paying postage ~~ too much hassle for nothing, while my 89-yr. old mother waits for a return? Nope, I just bought another set from the local Lowe's. It has lasted longer than the other ones put together."
1,A total Bore,"I just wasted $15 bucks on an absolute piece of trash video. I love Creed and its music. I consider myself a big fan, and foolishly bought this video dispite the warning on Creed's home page about the poor quality of this video. I watched 15 minutes and had to turn it off because it was SO incredibly boring. No concert footage and no Creed music. All they show is still shots of one of their concerts, and they use the same 10 pictures over and over and over and over again. Then there are interviews with bar owners, DJs, and their pre-fame sound guy, all saying how the band ""was so incredibly special"" and they all miraculously knew Creed was going to make it big. Yeah, right. Don't bother buying this video."
1,Creed: Unauthorized,"Even if you're a huge fan, do not buy this video. It's a cheap cash in on one of America's up and coming rock bands. No music, interviews from obscure angles and second rate djs voicing opinions will have you reaching for the off button long before you reach the end."
1,waste of a xmas gift,"A perfectly good xmas gift was wasted on this item There is no music, no concert footage, etc. It is dj's talking about the first time they heard My Own Prison. I don't even know why they made this video. Who cares about what dj's think, I assumed it had music on it, stupid me. This tape is not even worthwhile to a hardcore fan, if you want it, pay my postage and you can have it. keithweiser@yahoo.com"
1,Waste of tape,This is one of the worst things I have seen. I am a big fan of the band but this is a total waste of money. There is NO performance or music from the band. The background music is cheesy and everyone they interview wants to take some credit for the bands success. Buy something else not this. I feel sorry for anyone who spends anything other than disposable cash on this. Hopefully the band will put something out that is worth buying.
3,Very basic clearing tactics and techniques,"Hackathorn and Wilson cover basic techniques with a handgun such as; opening doors, clearing and entering rooms, use of verbal commands, target indicators and a demonstration of cover versus concealment. Demonstrations are discussed and then shown from multiple camera angles.Overall a well made DVD with clear video/audio and good advice from two respected individuals. Unfortunately, they only cover the basics and do not touch on; long guns, flashlights, stairs, etc..."
1,Bootleg,"This is yet another bootleg of the famous Flamin' Groovies. Its a repackaging of other material (more bootlegs) from the mafioso scum running AIM Records in Australia. Instead of buying this ripoff, pick up a copy of ""Groovies Greatest Grooves"" or Norton's ""Slow Death""."
2,where is the light?,"Hey the technology behind this is GREAT, they missed one thing. LIGHT. it has almost none. the light will shine to your toes thats it. Unfortunate."
4,Nice,"I would have to say that the earrings are not totally what I expected. I was looking to receive a larger pair. For the price, they are nice for teenagers. The quality was decent."
4,Good but...,"I am not saying this is a bad 'movie' about the Law of Attraction. It's just that it's too much like The Secret. The format, the interview styles, layout, etc... only it is 'marketed' to the Christian market. Not that it's bad, just too much like The Secret, that's all. No matter what, there is always value to something, even if the value is us realizing that something is not for us but it could resonate to others. It is good for people who are uncomfortable with the LOA that is not pushing Christian verses. I think it's high time that we all realize that religions basically are the same at the base. The message just got distorted because of 'self-interests' of people who run these religions."
2,The Secret Things of God: Rip-off of The Secret,"This is a weak attempt to put God and Religion into the wildly popular 'The Secret' movie. The original was a stand-alone movie that worked fine on it's own for people who may be spiritual, but aren't interested in religion and all of it's judgements. This is a low budget movie, especially when compared with the original. I'm not sure how they were not sued by the makers of 'The Secret,"" but it really isn't comparable anyway."
3,"Well worth a ""Buck"".","I remember hearing the track ""Pearls"" back when it came out and liking it. That memory motivated me to get this disc 16 years later, for a reasonable 1 cent I might add. To describe the disc I can only really say it's your typical 1990 alt-rock. A few tracks sound like The Replacements, which I believe they mention in the notes, and I also know that Jack Irons played drums (of Chili Peppers/Pearl Jam fame). This is nothing really essential, but worth it for the going used price, and a decent sound of the times."
1,Not worth the price,"I bought a set of these steak knives about 5 years ago, and boy do I regret it. The stamped blades dull quickly, do not sharpen well, and by this point are useless on any meat that is not fork-tender (and needs no knife any way). My serrated table knives are better for cutting most meats than these. The bees have detached from 2 of the knives, leaving a very rough indentation that makes using them uncomfortable. I've finally had it with these third-rate-masquerading-as-first knives and plan to replace them. Save your money--don't buy these!"
4,Job and the Mystery of Suffering.,"I like the book ""Job and the Mystery of Suffering"" because it has helped me to understand a little more the mystery of suffering in my life and the lives of others that I minister to. A good tool for reflecting more fully on the Book of Job as it might relate to one's own life. Richard Rohr is an excellent author. I have read other books written by him. He is very honest and upfront about things."
4,A compelling journey,"Ever since I first read C.S. Lewis's `The Problem of Pain', half a century ago, the search for answers has been part of my life. Richard Rohr has taken me in a new direction. Job and the Mystery of Suffering does not provide quick-fix answers, but offers instead a journey into the Pascal mystery. I found it an intriguing invitation and not an easy one to comprehend. A second, more thoughtful reading is yielding a much more meaningful understanding for me. The place of Job in human thinking is portrayed with an honesty that will appeal to many readers. One can identify readily with the great range of his expressions - rage, despair, pleading and impatience - but his unyielding trust through it all is well underlined as the book unfolds. I regard Job and the Mystery of Suffering as one of my better acquisitions."
5,GREAT FUN,ANYONE WHO GREW UP WITH THE BEATLES AND STILL HAVE ENOUGH KID IN THEMSELVES TO ENJOY A CARTOON SHOULD SEE THIS! HAVE FUN!!!
3,"Movie is great, DVD not a great value","I'm going to be very brief. If you liked the movie before, you will like it now. I have no complaints with the feature. It looks and sounds great and is as entertaining as ever. My complaint is that the DVD sells for a much higher than average DVD price, especially given how long it has now been on the market. For that price, one should get some sort of booklet with interviews, pictures, details, something. Instead, my copy arrived without even an insert. There is nothing in the packaging at all. The special features are nothing to get excited about either. For the price, I would have liked to seen more value in the total package. The film alone should not command such a high price tag."
4,you decide.........,"This film can be veiwed in many ways. I found it quite entertaining, and the song quality was fantastic! 2 of my siblings loved it, while my older brother tought it was stupid. It really is something you have to decide for yourself on, chances are youll either love it, or hate it."
5,"Fantastic, but not for everyone","People don't seem to understand that this movie is definitely NOT for everyone. It helps to be a Beatles fan and a fan of the late 60's/early 70's counterculture movement, as well as have an appreciation for psychedelic drugs and their effects. It's nothing you can put on the telly today and expect people to like or get it. I personally love it, but I wouldn't make just anyone watch it."
1,Worst movie EVER,"I was forced to watch this horrible movie in my art class. I felt like I was in that class for 60 years while this movie was playing. I don't understand how anybody, who is not high on drugs, could possibly like this movie. Pokemon has far more intelligence. The characters look like they've been drawn by six year olds, the story seems like it was written by a two year old, and the music is the same old abstract garbage that the Beatles are known for. I don't think they were the great legends people portray them to be. Their music is a result of what music sounds like when you're so high that you can't tell what in the world you're doing. Their popularity is the result of the bubble gum teenagers, in the past, who would love absolutely anything you throw at them. At least in the future, when people look back on Backstreet Boys, they will look back on people who actually had halfway decent voices."
3,"Great music, great visuals... bland story.","The restored visuals and audio are wonderful, but I can help but think that if the story had a bit more pizzazz, this would be a classic (I'm sure some would argue it already is). As it stands, I feel it's worth one or two viewings, but I'm personally going to stick to the Fab Four's audio recordings."
3,Animatic,"A very interesting animated film. The Beatles didn't want to make another film so the compromise was this animation with actors doing a credible job voicing the Beatle characters.The Beatles saw this film & were so impressed that they wanted to be in it - so they appear right at the very end.Some of the songs in this aren't their very best... viz ""Only a Northern Song"", & ""Alltogether Now"" but you might discover that this film is an allegory of the Beatles themselves (& the 60s) - brining colour & music to the world - something we're still grateful for."
2,missing inside paperwork,Missing all paper work that was advertised.none of the extras were there.payed alot of money for crapy case and dvd.
4,good videos but should of not cut scenes,"I remember watching the orginal on a old black-n-white television as a kid, and how I loved it and when I found that they were re-releasing it to VHS, I thought great. Well.. It is not as good as it used to be. The beginning few notes of baby, You're A Rich Man were remove, which I thought were great. I think that part could of been kept in , and they still could of added ""Hey Bulldog"". When I first say they Hey Bulldog on video, it made me cry. I can not explain why either. I think United Artists should recall all the videos and the DVD and put the missing scenes and keep Hey Bulldog in it.I give it 4 stars... If they did not remove any part of it , I would of given it 5 stars"
5,Gear!,"I have always loved the Beatles and thier music and they had a great influence on me. And this film has always been one of my perinnal favorites. It's a classic; wonderfully done at a very low amout of bread (only $1 million!) and the script is very inventive and charming. The colors are rich, trippy n psychedelic; and the remastering of the music is remarkable. You can't really describe it in detail, you'll have to experience it for yourself."
5,"Magical, hilarious, innovative, heartwarming","This movie is truly a miracle of fantasy and music. As ingenious as it is entertaining, it truly transports the viewer to a place only The Beatles seemed capable of taking us to--a wonderful, irreverent, and inspiring place where it always feels good to be alive. The music blends perfectly with the wit and action to create a timeless journey that touches the heart as it tickles the soul."
5,For The Record,"i just thought id let it be known that this movie will play (with the volume off) to the rhythm of any kind of music you play over it (similar to Wizard of Oz and Pink Floyd, except way cooler). it works with any genre, any tempo. Me and my friends will cue up a few songs of different varieties to test it. give it a shot, i found it fascinating."
5,Yellow Submarine RULEZ!,"Man, this movie is awesome! As a Beatle's lover and merchandise collector, I can say this is one of their bests. Great music, great art, and the soundtrack (which I also own) is terriffic!!!"
5,Yellow Submarine,"It is as great as I remember it, only the colors are more vibrant and the music is clearer. It is truly a classic"
4,Welcome back from litigation limbo,"It was years since I saw it on the big screen, and I couldn't help but wonder why I couldn't find it when ""Hard Day's Night"", ""Help"" and even ""Magical Mystery Tour"" was easy to find. Even though mired in ""litigation limbo"", that may have been a blessing considering the great restoration now available. But is it really the Beatles? The music, yes. Everything else, no. But it is still a fun movie, in a campy sort of way, visually exciting, and the music is awesome in Dolby Digital 5.1!"
5,great movie,"I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid, so when I saw the DVD of it for sale online I hopped on the opportunity to get it. I'm overseas right now and the package still got to me with in a week and in perfect condition."
4,The 60's in review,"This is very retro 60's and was very good to see again. The animation and voice over was very good. Lot's to learn about ""blue-meanies""..."
1,"Fantastic movie, but beware of BOOTLEGS!","BEWARE of BOOTLEG versions! I have attempted to purchase the Yellow Submarine DVD 3 times through 3 different amazon sellers and each time I have received a bootleg DVD. Fortunately, I was able to return them and get a refund.It is unfortunate that this DVD is no longer in print and as such, prices have gone up and people are willing to sell second rate copies. As for the film itself, it is still a wonderfully positive, clever and beautiful film, with one of the top soundtracks of all time."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM JEAN'S RECORDS!!!!,DO NOT buy yellow submarine from a seller called Jean's Records. The version of the yellow submarine I was looking for was not right and I wanted to cancel my order from this person but got no emails after I tried several times to contact the seller. My order was canceled by amazon but NO REFUND!!! although their feedback looks good don't be fooled. Jean's records dose not communicate with customers or offer refunds
5,BEST CARTOON MOVIE EVER,"This movie is great,im glad to see they are putting it out again. being 16 i missed it when it was new. But i cant wait to own this classic movie. I suggest to anyone who wants to see a good movie. weather or not your a beatles fan give this movie a shot."
4,"I saw it, I enjoyed it, I want it, I cannot find it!",Animation fans have to like this flick. It's not Fantasia but it does have Beatles music. I cannot believe it is not available to rent or purchase.
5,Wonderful video! We hope we can find it again!,My family and I really enjoy this video. It is hilarious yet sometimes suspenseful. We used to rent it a lot until we could not find it anymore. We really love it and hope we can find it again soon.
1,crazy!,"i loved this movie! it was totally finky and crazy and extremely weird! near the end is a very cute part with the beatles chatting, and the movie ends with ""all together now"" the only drawback--the beatles in the movie are not the real beatles talking, so it's hard to tell which one is talking. nione of them sound remotely likre the real thing except for paul, who was quite good."
1,dont play with perfection!,i love this film but the new version is boring.i miss the things that make it look original like marks on the film! i prefer the old version which was shorter!
1,boring film CARTOON TRASH!!!!,"one reviewer from the US is right, got the same opinion like hers! I would rate the film is like a cartoon trash and boring story. Scooby Doo of Hanna barbera production is better than this oneBut the film can be given to the children during their school holiday."
1,"Still waiting, over a month later.","Item has still not arrived. Now late for a birthday gift. I still want it, but SURE wish service were better!"
5,submarine not sub-par,"always one of my favorite movies, this new print with added music and footage originally edited made it worth owning. my nephew has since seen the movie and enjoys it very much. well worth the purchase."
5,Brilliant! A great animation gem!,They've done an AWESOME job at restoring this masterpeice. Really worthy getting on DVD. Brilliant!
5,"Classic,Buy it now!","I've waited ages for this classic movie to come out on DVD and well has it been worth it!First class transfer restored to it's full glory and awesome digital sound not to mention nice extra's too.I was though under the impression that the Dvd was to include long lost ""Hey Bulldog"" footage.Now i know that the US version had the Hey Bulldog sequence cut from the master but i am talk'in about Real Beatles footage of them Recording a version of that great song.I do hope that if such footage exist's it wasn't put on the American version only or is the UK version the same.Any Idea's?"
5,Excellent Remaster,Awesome restoration of one of the best animated movies ever made. Hey Bulldog is the first time seen on Video animated. The 5.1 dolby digital effects during the Attack of the Meanies and the Love Glove is awesome! Check out the error in the subtitling during 'Only a Northern Song' The subtitle reads lyrics to be 'Only a Normal Song'!!!
3,Great film. Great sounding music,"I'm not a purist, and I realize the music was re-mixed for this. But the restored color and enhanced audio made this a really fun film.This is, however, the weakest of the Beatles films. Suitable to put on as you're cleaning the house and enjoy moments of it, difficult to sit on the couch and watch end-to-end. And remember, the documentary notwithstanding, J, P, G, & R did NOT provide the voices for this film. They are clever forgeries."
2,This movie hasn't aged well - rent before you buy,I remember seeing this movie back when it came out and I just loved it. I love the Beatles and own all of their U.S. releases on the original Capitol and Apple Records. I bought this so my children could see it. What a disappointment! It really hasn't aged well. The music and songs sounded great but other parts of the dialogue were difficult to hear. Parts of it were really boring. The best part was seeing the fab four at the very end. A Hard Day's Night would probably have been a better choice. I've seen it recently on American Movie Classics and it's funnier than I had remembered. I suggest you rent this before you buy.
5,It's somthing very special...,"Being a huge Beatles fan i was excited to finally get to see this film. I was not disappointed. Granted, it may be a little weird to watch the first go around for those people who have been brought up to believe that watching any animated movie that's not Walt Disney is wrong. Don't expect a movie along the lines of The Lion King or Aladdin cause you won't get it. Don't ask too many questions either because by the time you come up with answers, the movie is over. Just sit back, enjoy it, and by all means, don't take it so seriously."
4,The Beatles --- Yellow Submarine,"This is a very enjoyable, some what pschadelic animated movie based on many of the Beatle's songs. The restoration of the film is great. Humorous."
4,Yellow Submarine - The Movie on DVD,A little dated still fun. Helped my kids get into Beatles music which was the main point.
1,Brilliant Movie - Lousy Product,"DVD arrived with advertised ""collectible booklet"" missing. Format is not true widescreen. It is 4:3 format cropped to 16:9 letterbox, chopping off top and bottom of scenes. Unacceptable butchery. Very disappointing. I really question whether the DVD is genuine or a counterfeit. It is being returned.BTW, the movie itself is 5 stars!"
3,"Great movie, bad DVD","Sadly, this DVD would not work on any of our 4 DVD players. It put up the menu, then would not run the movie no matter what. I had to re-author it via my computer DVD burner, and make a copy that works. Great movie, bad DVD."
1,I love the beatles but...,"I am a huge beatles fan, but in my opinion, this movie is terrible. The story is all over the place and it gets very boring very fast. The movie is about an hour and a half, and it seems to drag on for years. The only saving factor for this film is the great music, but even still, the Beatles have many better tunes than these. I think your money would be better spent on a Beatles CD (perhaps Sgt. Pepper or Rubber Soul) or on Pink Floyd's The Wall, which is worlds above and beyond this sinking submarine."
2,Maybe I didn't do enough bong hits!,"I was hoping this was better than I remebered, but it really wasn't... the story is lousy, it's slow and disjointed, and there are only a few good songs... which admittedly sound great, but if you're gonna remaster Beatle songs, why start with filler like ""Only A Northern Song""? When they remaster Revolver I'll be knocking people down to get a copy, but this just didn't do it for me. The Beatles weren't fully engaged in this project, and it shows."
2,creative yet boring,"I am somewhat of a beatles fan, but I really didn't care for this movie. Sure, the animation sequences were ok but anyone over the age of 10 will probably find this film to be dull. The soundtrack to Yellow Submarine is good, though."
5,Yellow Submarine,I just want to say I saw this movie as a kid and loved it I wanted it forever and finally stupid Michael Jackson gave up the rights. Just when DVD became grand. I LOVE IT so you should too if you have any taste.
4,Great Restoration,"""Yellow Submarine"" is very late 60's, and interesting. What I found most interesting was the terrific restoration job done on the DVD. They took a so-so mono soundtrack, cleaned it up and turned it into a full 5.1 Dolby Digital. The video has also been cleaned up.I was also impressed at the number of listening options they offer. You can watch the movie with the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, with the original mono soundtrack, with the director's commentary or, best of all, with just the music. When you select that option the dialog is removed and you hear only the incidental music and the Beatle's songs in the film and you hear it in 5.1 surround.They didn't neglect the .1 channel, BTW. I had to turn down my sub because it was shaking the walls!"
5,It's The Beatles! It's an animated movie! 'Nuf Said!,My kids grew up watching this on VHS for years and they wanted to see it again recently so I got this DVD to show them. What a trip down memory lane! This classic never gets old!
4,why isnt movie this rated with a million stars,"Great the beatles made a perfect movie. the only complaint i have is that it isnt the beatles voices in the movie but its a very good impersonation so its all good.BLUE MEANIES ""NO"""
3,Interesting,"This was a pretty Good book. It kept me hooked the entire book. This is the first of the Mandie books that I have read and I am now exited to read more of these books. I think that the reason these books are so good are because Mandie is such an adventurous character. She leds you on many adventures, but after exploring the school attic she is compeled to revisit this forbidden attic. This is an exciting book with a very supprising ending."
1,Do not buy this for your child !!!,"This book is appalling. The ignorance and lack of respect for people of non-white ethnicity is disturbing and offensive. Mandie's ""discovery"" in the attic teaches a complete disregard for the quality of life of people with disabilities."
2,Timeless Media recycles old newsreels and stock footage,"Another disappointment from Timeless Media Group, maybe better named ""Clueless Media Group"" for once again recycling old newsreel footage that might have been impressive over a generation or two ago, but hardly today with the plethora of materials and the stardards of quality in animation, remastered footage, and subject-area experts we have grown accustomed to over the last decade or so thru the fine series of documentaries produced on cable like ""The History Channel,"" the BBC, including public television's, ""Nova"" and ""The American Experience"".With poor narration and no remastering, this set is for purists only. The $26.99 charged by Amazon for this set is outrageous; this set can be obtained from other retailers like Ross Dress for Less for a mere $5.99-$9.99 if you must have it."
2,Warbirds of WWII is - Warboo's !!!!,"The Warbirds of WWII is a horrible DVD, poor quality picture and poorer quality narration!! Don't waste your money on this item (I already threw my copy away) and if you get it free, don't waste your time watching it!!! You would be better off using your time to wash your car or paint your house!!!!!"
4,Irish 60's!,"Very good collection of some of the blues/rock/beat bands from Ireland from the sixties.Highly recommended for collectors, sixties fans, or anyone looking for good time music."
3,The same Jobim Repertoire Over and Over Again,"Are you a new entrant fan of Jobim? Then begin with Jobim's originals! Jobim foreign output has set the pace for an ensemble standard which is hard to achieve.Mr.Morelembaum was a longtime excellent cello player for Jobim and he's also collaborated with other major artists in Brazil but the ensemble created by his writings is a mere copy, though a well-crafted copy of the extraordinary efforts you'll find in Jobim's original collaboration with Claus Ogerman or Eumir Deodato.And you can listen to it all when you click on those wonderful 5-star CDs offered here @Amazon like ""Tide"", ""Wave"", ""Stone Flower"" and the classic ""The Composer Plays..."".The best non-Jobim records on Jobim's compositions are those whose producers have not tried to re-create the original ensemble ... Sinatra has smartly noticed this so he did not hesitate to call Jobim himself to create the two Sinatra-Jobim masterpieces."
5,delightful sound,i love Jobim's music and this CD is most excellent in its treatment of these great standards...i have heard Desafinado done by many many artists but in my opinion this is the best version ever recorded...this quartet are just so tight in their musical movements that it is a great treat to listen to their choices from a world-class songbook. i appreciate the quiet beauty of their voices....which have a whisper quality..i read the proceeding reviews and bought this CD and it is so fantastic..do yourself a favor and get this for your spirit
3,Not the Comsats!,"The production qualities lack a certain fire!The songs, in gen'l, are cynically made for the marketplace. Check out the 1st 3 Comsats CDs. Much butter!"
4,Great lamp,Delivery was great. It took about 30 minutes to put together. Packaging could be better. This lamp puts off a ton o light. I have it with two of the matching table lamps and actually end up dimmin all three down. I get a lot o compliments on them and they are very unique.
3,Lights are Glaringly Bright.,"I like the looks of this light a lot. You have to be intuitive to put it together though because the directions are not very good. However, the lights are nearly blinding when you turn them to full capacity, they literally hurt my eyes. Fortunately there is a dimmer that is part of the light but even at lower levels of light it still seems to be more of a ""glaring"" light."
1,Hard to assemble,This lamp arrived without any instructions and after an hour I still hadn't gotten the poles aligned correctly.l It also doesn't put out much light. I returned it.
2,Frustrating Assembly,"Lamp arrived, box was demolished. good thing they sent four glass pieces because one was broken. Make sure when putting this together that you put the posts on correctly or the glass wont seat right (there's only one way it will work without the glass knocking into the other post). look at the picture here online, I had to take mine apart and do it over. I have this lamp behind a sectional (behind the rounded piece) in the corner so we cant see the base at all. not bad sticking up from behind the couch.Pain in the neck to put together but ok for the price I guess. My lamp is very bright. Wonder where to get replacements for the ""bulbs""?The dimmer/on-off switch should be further down the plug."
3,"Very pretty, but not terribly bright","I really love how this lamp looks. I did not find it hard to assemble or feel that it was cheap looking. However, I was disappointed with the amount of light that the generates. I needed it for a decent sized room with no overhead light. The amount of light, combined with the shadows produced by each light made this not the best fit for the room. So, I purchased another lamp and will use this one in a smaller room."
3,Hard to put together,"I really like this lamp, the look of it, the light that it gives off-my biggest challenge was putting it together. I had one before my son broke the original one, but this one was already put together for me. I had no idea that putting the three posts together could be so challenging!"
2,Terrible packaging and instructions,"Although the item arrived promptly, the packaging was horrible. As a result 2 of the 4 glass covers included for the halogen lamps were broken. Now I can't even use the lamp. Unfortunately, I did not realize that the parts were broken until I had already assembled the rest of the lamp (which was extremely cumbersome). Returning this lamp would be too much trouble at this point, so I'm just trying to figure out how to get replacement bulb covers. No luck yet."
1,Too Cheap Looking,"This is a purchase that I regret. It looked modern and stylish in the photo, but once I got it and assembled it, the quality just did not match the price or the style. It is very eye catching, but that just draws the eyes to the marginal construction. It is not very stable. The light output is decent, but for me this floor lamp was more about the look than the light, and I do not like the look in person."
4,Nice lamp...,"Ok so this is not the easiest lamp to put together. A bit frustrating. I thought that the light it gives out would not be so concentrated. The glass part does a poor job of diffusing it and what you get are 3 very bright spots. Its definitly stylish and looks nice, but if you are trying to completely light up a room, this is not your lamp."
4,Difficult to assemble but looks great,"Hey you guys this item is really nice but it took over an hour to figure it out, who would think it would take soo long! I couldn't get the pipes to align correctly, PLEASE NOTE: THE MOUNTING AREAS ON THE BASE ARE NOT WELDED, THEY TURN I had to actually turn mine so that the angle would be correct. After that it went no problem. Enjoy!"
1,Quest...,Quest is nothing special. If you love american DBZ go buy this. It has the eppisodes where they first meet Guru (the eldest Namekian). The other eppisodes are when Gohan and Krillin encounter Vegeta on Namek. Buy this if you LOVE american DBZ you can buy this but I don't so I'll wait for subbed.
3,the race,This part of dragonballz is a race nothing more.There the gang raceing back and forth all in the time span of 10 min and there almost no fitting!
2,keep some spares,"not a bad box, at first. Oversized but I clip it on my belt out of the way so that didn't bother me. I didn't notice the weight, the line is fine, and the speed gear reel worked great at first. First problem was the loader door jammed and i had to disassemble it to load it. Then the gear stopped working. I disassembled it, cleaned everything, and gave it way more attention than it deserved, but to no avail, ground plastic gears are useless. I'm going double or nothing and buying a Tajima gear drive line and hopefully it will last. I would still rather keep a spare of one of these than rewind a reel for as long as it takes to snap a line, so gear drive for me. If I could redesign this box, I'd use a plastic box, metal gears, a release not on the reel, and a different loader door."
1,Flawed design,I think I was able to use this line maybe three times before it wouldn't wind up took it apart got to wind up used it again and again wouldn't wind finally ended up throwing it in the trash where it belongs
2,doesn't last,"this works fine while it works, but wears out quick. Like other reviewers, the gears just totally gave up after about two or three months. i highly recomment the red tajima box instead."
5,M-I-Z...,This Flag looks great in front of our home. It lasted through a rough Missouri winter too! We bought one for our friends. I would recommend this product.
1,Waste of an afternoon,"Did you ever read a book where you kept wanting to rewrite parts of it? That's the way this book was for me. The whole book left me feeling unsatisfied. Especially when the ""hero"", and I use that term loosely, cheats on Peach without an ounce of remorse and Peach sees it as her fault for not understanding his needs."
3,Not bad,"This CD does have a lot of music, and the titles of the songs imply a sense of humor by the artist. Most songs tend to be rather fast tempoed, and good for zill work."
1,don't waste your money,"I felt like I was stuck in a cheesy 60's movie for what I could tolerate of this CD. I could not find anything I felt was even remotely danceable, and the sound quality is poor to boot!"
1,Horrible DVD quality - Pandora's Box,Has tons of damaged areas that are skipped over. So disappointed!!I haven't watched the Diary of a Lost Girl DVD yet and hoping it's not the same. =(
1,"Get the DVD version from Amazon.UK, March 12, 2005","See Mark M's review.This is erroneous information. DVD has to be Region 0, AND1) YOUR TV MUST BE PAL(BRITISH)PICTURE FORMATTED, OR2) YOUR DVD PLAYER MUST BE MULTISYSTEM, OR3) THE DVD MUST BE NTSC PICTURE FORMATTED...NOT LIKELYI hope this saves you money. It's too late for me!Mike"
3,"Great performance, disappointing film","I finally saw this film and was impressed with Brooks' performance - she conveys an innocent wantonness that is most charming. Contrary to what other reviewers here say, I didn't see her as an ""evil temptress"" at all - she seems more like an adult child who lacks any sense of inhibition, which leads to disastrous results.The film begins engagingly, with the viewer forced to reassess his own judgements of this unbridled ""Pandora."" But after the first half, it quickly degenerates into melodrama: everything that could possibly go wrong does, and that last half hour is so overdone that one disengages completely.In the end, Brooks is the only reason to see this film."
5,an american classic!!!!,"This is by far my favorite movie. The absence of words only adds to the movie, does not take away at all. Louise Brooks is so talented and glamorous this movie has stayed in my mind for many weeks!!!"
2,A Bit Disappointed,"I purchased this movie because I think Louise Brooks is one of the most beautiful women on the 20th century and wanted to see some of her work. I found that in this day and time I had to really work at trying to get into the idiom of this silent film, and never totally succeeded. The gestures and dramatic conventions from so long ago are hard to fathom. Louise is lovely to look at, but the story line is rather predictable, but that may be a function of nearly 80 years' refinement of that plot. It may have been quite fresh and daring back in the twenties, but I couldn't get my mind there. If you wish to see a movie nearly as old that was very racey at the time and has wonderful usage of symbolism, I would recommend ""Ecstacy"" with Heddy Lamarr."
5,"Cheaper plus no anti-Christian tariff for ""hard to find""","...Rushdoony, in typical crushingly intellectual yet real world livable fashion, makes the case that schools (public, private, or home) for Christian children must have a distinctively Christian curriculum. The implications of Christianity permeating all areas of life are developed in this book as the default rational for making every subject of education distinctly within the shadow of Christian theology.While you do not have to be a scholar for this book, nothing Rushdoony writes is for the intellectually lazy. Be prepared to THINK and in some cases reread whole chapters. A perfect book for homeschoolers to be."
3,"Very good research, poor writing","The author performed an incredible amount of extensive research using primary sources. In _Dirt and Deity_ he also dispels many of the legends associated with Burns in the past. However, the book suffers a major shortcoming: the book is written like a stream of events, many of them unrelated, rather than in coherent phases. There are chapters, of course, but McIntyre does not summarize or ""re-cap"" each one (or any of them, really). This leads to confusion and a lack of coherence in the reader's mind."
5,"Brilliant, brilliant","When I first bought this single in a Baltimore thrift store, I was a bit incredulous. The album cover looked terrible, the packaging was non-existent, and, while, I had regretfully never heard of the band.Then I put it on the turntable, and everything changed.Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld possibly have the best new sound of the 00s. Their work rivals that of early Velvet Underground in both originality and plain ""rockout-ness."" Like many bands of our time, they obviously take from more than a few influences; the Stooges, early British DIY, and even Bowie are more than apparent on the record.But regardless of who they are, or where their sound comes from, you should be hearing a lot of Timmy and the Lords of the Underground in years to come. I suggest turning it up."
4,Five stories here...,"In THE HOUSE, former sanitarium patient Joanna Pettit locates a vacant house that she's seen in a long-recurring dream, but never dared to enter.CERTAIN SHADOWS ON THE WALL plague Louis Hayward after his sister Agnes Moorehead dies under his care. With Rachel Roberts and Grayson Hall.LINDEMANN'S CATCH is a captured mermaid, who awakens emotions in cold-hearted sea captain Stuart Whitman, leading him to seek a way to keep her alive.THE LATE MR. PEDDINGTON is the reason why widowed Kim Hunter visits funeral director Harry Morgan and insists on a tight budget for the services. With Randy Quaid.A FEAST OF BLOOD is a distinct possibility when rejected suitor Norman Lloyd presents an unusual fur brooch to calculating beauty Sondra Locke. With Hermione Baddeley."
4,Good Book,"I find this useful although I'd have appreciated even more recipes. I thought it was well balanced, written directly, and clarified the whole glycemic discussion for me. A quick read, too."
2,"Dated Staistics & Info - Some tidbits helpful, maybe.","Part 1 is repetitive and touts really dated statistics. While it is true that 20 year old data may still be valid, surely newer studies are available to reinforce the main contentions. Part 2 may be helpful if you accept Part 1. I'm going to keep reading other sources. This is not the last word, best source answer to the diet, dieting, health and disease questions it attempts to answer."
1,Buy the Good Carb Cookbook instead,"This book is poorly written. The information is good, if you can find it and understand what he's trying to say. He makes up his own names for certain words. He jumps around. You can't use this book as a reference - you'll never find the information again. There's no consistent writing pattern. Buy The Good Carb Cookbook by Sandra Woodruff instead. It has the same information, in a flowing and easy to read, understandable format. She doesn't make up her own words like tricklers, etc. And you get a bunch of good recipes too."
5,This book changed my life forever!!,This is the ideal book for those who would like the whole story on carbohydrates and the glycemic index! It is an excellent resource for diabetics and non-diabetics. It explains how to eat the right amount of carbohydrates for a healthy lifestyle! My whole outlook on diet and nutrition has changed thanks to this book!
3,Insightful but not worth buying,"I've given up on dieting (restricting calories, Atkins, Jenny Craig... just torture!). Instead, I'm trying to eat more healthily so I read this book hoping to get some pointers. This book is true to its title and gives some great tidbits on what carbs you should eat, what you should stay away from and why/how certain carbs have different effects on your body. However, its definitely not worth buying because most of it is common sense or taken from high school biology. Also, the GI food guide is way too limited! Instead, I suggest saving your money by just thumbing through the book at the bookstore if you have time to waste. Its so short that it'll only take you 30 minutes to read, if even that!"
3,Missing Pages,The book was missing the solution section for the practice exam which rendered the book useless. This was not included in the description of the book.
4,Elegant and Powerful,"Showing how one man endured the worst nightmare during World War II and how it affects him and his mind throughout his life, ""The Pawnbroker"" is a gripping story about loss, acceptance, family, and sacrifice. It is also a story about ""moving on"". It's an exceptionally well told story and a fine addition to literature and fictional prose regarding the holocaust and the lives of those that nightmare affected."
4,A Man Broken by Tragedy,"This work contrasts with the sanitized view of war in much of modern media. The pawnbroker is an embittered, heartbroken Jewish man who survived World War II. He shouts out in despair: ""I don't believe in God, just money!"""
5,Dominica,"Saw a show about Dominican peasant music, liked Segura the best, bought this CD, and keep it in my automobile. Nice."
4,what fun to be had,"this anime is just getting more and more interesting, I have been hooked from vol1, if you are looking for a some laughs with magic and some fighting, give this series a try. I am waiting for Vol 4 to see where it leads and what trouble everyone gets into."
2,Poorly finished and packaged,"These are far, far from ""ready for use"" as described above. The cutting edges look like they were made by someone who really didn't care. These will take a lot longer than planned for refinishing before use. I thought ""Made in Sheffield England"" was supposed to be a statement of quality. I think they should start taking lessons from the Chinese. I also ordered separate 1 1/4"" and 1 1/2"" chisels which were even worse, with both having a chip on the cutting edge. I'll be reviewing those separately and rating them even lower.This set is packaged in a flimsy lightweight cardboard box with 3 equally flimsy cardboard dividers between the 6 chisels. It is a joke. The chisel handles were all a little roughed-up, but no damage to the cutting edges."
5,A Must See for All,"Let's face it, this world has many dark corners. However, the darker the corner, the brighter the Light shines! It's easy to think that only bad things happen in the world. However, Furious Love explores how love is changing lives in the midst of darkness. God's love always shines brighter! Darren Wilson once again weaves a powerful and life changing story. Furious Love is the sequel to Finger of God, that has a slightly different focus. However, both of these films are life changing, and the Body desperately needs to see both of these films!"
2,Furious Fanaticism,"This film documents the religious zeitgeist of a particular perspective and the travels to different parts of the country and world to attempt to find some sort of religious unity. Obviously the content of this film will appeal to a certain population, largely those who share a similar mindset as the film's creators, I was rather unimpressed. The format was easily digested, but entirely too self-assured of some profundity of an underlying message of religious unity between cultures. To me, this ended up coming across as an acrimonious thinly veiled judgment of anyone who wasn't a bible-thumping proselytizer and it left a bad taste in my mouth."
2,Trickery,"Watched trailer on YouTube and looked this movie up under foreign films, which gives no real description of the movie. The trailer did make me curious to find out more, but there should be a big cross on the cover for Christian movie."
5,Furious Love,I have heard from others that this would be a heart stretcher. After watching this my heart was stretched to want to love more than ever the way Jesus loves. I also used a portion of this in our childrens ministry to show our kids that God wants to use them at their young age. They were moved greatly by what they saw of the Indonesian children in this. We're raising up children to love furiously!
4,"From someone who is emerging from skepticism, this was incredible!!","As someone emerging from skepticism toward all things ""charismatic"", I thought this was quite good.Sincere and genuine are also words I would use to describe this effort to show examples of contemporary supernatural acts of God among regular everyday people.Still don't know what to do with a lot of this, but I'm learning. While I felt some questions weren't adequately answered (I find myself leveling the same accusation at ""Mythbusters""), for what it is, there is much that simply cannot be argued with.What a display of the Father's love for His children. Remarkable in many ways.I've recommended this to several friends- ones whom I trust will not cast me out on grounds of heresy or lunacy! I also recommend the follow-up film, ""Father of Lights""."
1,I'm sorry I can not give tute of something that I have...,I'm sorry I can not give title of something that I have because this article has never reached the post office to request that the send and it already has a month so really that bad but I can not talk about something and not proven
4,Good Listening Material,"My impression of this disk is that it will appeal to Phish aphicionados, on account of Tom Marshall's contributions to Phish (eg. Run Like An Antelope) but it has a more broadbase appeal to listeners of genrally mellow music.Tom has a smoother and higher pitch voice than he did when I heard him contributing in Phish concerts, which differentiates him from Trey, which is what many listeners may expect.If you want a ""sounds like"" for this album, a lot of it reminds of ""Strange Design"" for some reason.I like it a lot."
2,Mediocre illustrations,"Lines: A Half-Century of Yacht Designs by Sparkman & Stephens, 1930-1980, consists almost entirely of scaled down photographic reproductions of actual Sparkman & Stephens company drawings. Several are faint and barely legible. The few pages of text about Olin Stephens are uninformative and read like promos for a music cd."
4,Elegant Voice,"For those familiar with Sometimes I Dream, a showcase for Mario Frangoulis' classical voice, you may be slightly disappointed with his latest release. However, just keep in mind that his voice is elegant - no matter what he sings. After hearing Sometimes I Dream, we've grown to expect an operatic type voice -- but he is a crossover artist and will not be pegged to a certain class of music. As long as he doesn't go Pop, I'll stick with anything he releases."
2,Big disappointment!,"The first album was out of this world. This one is very bad. Mario decided to go Euro-trash pop. The lyrics are fantastic but accompanied by third rate teener-bopper music/arrangements.He still has as great voice but it is wasted in directions not worthy of him.There was one song that was memorable. The duet with Alejandro Fernandez. That one was pure butter. It melted my heart and got my inspiration going.I couldn't help thinking when listening to his latest CD that he wanted to capture the Josh Groban market. I have to admit that I AM NOT a fan of Groban. I simply don't like his voice but I do like his material.Oh well, I'll wait for a few week for LARA FABIAN's new French release called ""9""."
4,Go for Josh instead,"I bought this cd on the advice of a friend. While Mario's voice is superb and the songs good, I simply like Josh Groban better overall.Most of the songs are not as inspired as the songs on Closer by Josh Groban, and Mario lacks the vocal power of Josh Groban granted, his language is impeccable, but Josh is simply a better vocalist."
1,What a disappointment,"One word: CHEESE! I would prefer that he stick with stirring arrangements of standards, rather than sing ""original"" lyrics such as ""I'll love you till the end of time"". The voice is adequate, but it just doesn't make up for the insipid musical selections. I enjoyed some of the songs from ""Sometimes I dream"", so I took a chance on this one. What a waste of money!I actually threw it away."
5,To Die For,"Mario Frangoulis, the singing dreamboat, has done it again...and then some. I did not think it was possible to top his last CD ""Sometimes I Dream"", but he has.Not to be negative or disparaging, but Mario leaves Josh Groban and even Joshua Payne far behind in the dust. He brings an utterly romantic, physical, European sensiblity to the American music scene that simply did not exist in mainstream pop until now. And, ah, to gaze at those photos of him while you listen!!!For a taste, try Amazon's sample of ""Come What May"" from ""Moulin Rouge"". You will truly experience the song like you've never heard it before. And your heart feels like it's bursting open with passion, yes? Like you're standing on a rooftop, singing to the world, yes? That's just a snippet of what ""Follow Your Heart"" is like. So what are you waiting for??? Buy! Buy!!!"
3,Good add to my collection...,"...however, I found it a little tiring to listen to. 'Sometimes I Dream' is a much better collection of songs by Mario Frangoulis. There seems to be more energy put into the project. So go for the other album first, then augment your collection with 'Follow Your Heart'."
3,Slightly disappointing,"Music For Nurses is the 5-track EP that comes hot on the heels of Oceansize's brilliant in parts though inconsistent debut, 'Effloresce'. 'Music For Nurses' suffers from the opposite problem: everything here is good, but nothing stands out as brilliant'. Though, on paper, opener 'one out of nONE' ought to be brilliant: an explosive diversion into the territory of metal, it doesn't quite come off, as the verses sound like rehashed Oceansize, despite a brilliant riff and some top-drawer screaming. It powers through various sections almost too quickly, and thus comes across as good but not as great as it might have been. 'Paper Champion' is a building, atmospheric number; 'Dead Dogs An' All Sorts' flies the post-rock torch, and 'As The Smoke Clears' is a far slower metal number. All are accomplished, but they lack the killer intensity (and tunes) of tracks like 'Catalyst' or 'One Day All This Could Be Yours'. Worth having, but could have been better."
3,disappointed,"very odd-shaped pieces that don't fit together very well, making you question each time you connect two pieces. Wish I would've bought a puzzle made by buffalo games, much better quality. I will still finish the puzzle although it will be more frustrating than fun :( Last puzzle I spend my money on from eurographics."
2,A Charlie Brown Schmalzfest,"As others have noted, the ""Charlie Brown Suite"" is a ponderous, overblown arrangement of Charlie Brown tunes accompanied by orchestra and with little improvisation. Noises from the audience (squeaking chairs, etc.) are clearly audible during the quieter moments of the suite. According to the liner notes, Guaraldi's son has uncovered a lot of unissued material on reel-to-reel and other formats. The selections here are from the collection of pianist George Winston, a Guaraldi fan. I hope the remaining material, which he hopes to issue in the future, is better than this. The three tracks aside from the suite are more interesting; however, if you're looking for Peanuts music, you'd be much better off sticking with the three other Guaraldi Charlie Brown CDs currently available."
3,Another Black Company novel,"The series loses a bit of speed in this installment. The story is divided between more narrators than usual, which makes it lose some of its coherence. I'm also not crazy about the sudden emphasis on religion and gods. The first 4 books gave a very human, soldierly face to fantasy, but in ""Dreams of Steel"" we suddenly get superbeings influencing the action. Not my favorite example of the series, but still worth reading."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Perhaps the weakest of the Black Company series. The Lady, her kid, and lots of action with local politics and the rise and antics of a thug or thuggee type cult of killers and their death worship. They want to use and/or worship this child to bring about really bad things. Naturally most other people oppose this vehemently and violently."
3,Dreams of Steel (spoiler),"Lady, now in command of the Black Company, gets drawn into a Thuggee-like cult. Meanwhile, Croaker ends up in the company of Soulcatcher...Like the books before it, this has a refreshingly straightforward tone and plenty happens. I was frustrated by the lack of increased depth in some of the secondary characters, especially the Swan-Mather-Blade group. And I never felt I had a grasp on what was going on in Longshadow's head. Lady's POV generally works pretty well, though she's awfully slow to realize she's pregnant; the reader is hundreds of pages ahead."
3,This book is not up to Cook's normal standard of work...,"It's just not that good. Mr. Cook takes us away from the traditional focus of the Black Company books. It's no longer Croaker, Goblin, One-Eye, and the rest. Instead we're provided a view from the point of ""The Lady,"" some guy named Smoke, and other characters that we don't give a hoot about. The story has also completely diverged from the other novels, no more company business, it's about the Lady's goals and desires for power and conquest. I don't want to give much else away about the book, but most of the plot is quite obvious and not surprising.There are some other aspects of the story that bother me as well, such as the sudden introduction of gods and religion. I personally thought he was doing quite well without them. It's as if Cook wants to change his world in the middle of the story..."
1,I need to know more,I am wanting a Judo video as the best substitute for not having classes close to our house. I wish I knew whether this video is any good.
5,Always reliable,"As with all the ""for Dummies"" books, this one is logically laid out and easy to use. I recommend it for any one starting out in digital scrapbooking. It takes you from the very basic to the more complex and beyond, with clear illustrations and photos (even some in color.)"
4,Good beginners book,"My daughter and I are new to digital scrapbooking and wanted to find a book to help us get started. I still like using my paper, stickers and embellishments, but she (age 25) is loving the digital because it's less mess!Try it-- you'll like it! It takes some time to figure out how to get started, but I can see that it will be really helpful to share online with friends and family who don't live nearby. This book is a great start!!Also look online for various digital scrapbooking websites that give you colorful ideas."
4,Very Helpful,"This book has a little bit of everything...business letters, envelopes, thank you letters, press releases, ads, newsletters and more. It doesn't go really deep into any of them, but it gives you the fast food idea of all of them. Very very helpful. I keep it on my desk...you never know what you will have to write."
2,Almodover clone loses a lot in the translation,"Yep, it's another food and sex movie. This time the food of choice is ham which makes me nauseous if the script hadn't gotten there first. Everyone in this movie is a cliche and a reprehensible scumbag. ...How bad is this movie? Penelope Cruz is naked for half of her scenes and it's still boring. And those scenes would be much better if she wasn't naked with one of the creepy male leads.He's got the food.He's got the nudity. He's got the crazy people running around. He's got the obsessiveness. But what is missing from this movie is a heart.If you really want to see Penelope Cruz naked, rent it out. Otherwise avoid this movie. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because Penelope Cruz is fun to look at. That's it. If you hate Penelope Cruz then there's NOTHING to recommend in this movie."
1,Jamon Jamon from Spain Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem just starting careers,"The dvd did not work in my player, Amazon didn't sent a packing order, so I reterned the dvd directly to the return address on the package. Havn't heard back from them in two months, so I'm out the dvd and the forty dollars."
3,Small correction for Jerry McElhaney,"I would just like to point out that Jamon Jamon was originally released in Europe in 1991, and that Penélope Cruz was just 17 years old at the time - not 19.I was surprised to find that this movie made it past the censors and remains available today. Underage nudity is generally permitted in non sexually-explicit situations (ie, family photos at a naturist colony). However, ""Jamon Jamon"" contains fairly explicit scenes with [...]If underage teen sexploitation is your thing, then dig in. If not, Penélope Cruz fans should skip this boring flick and buy the funnier, sexier, non-explicit ""La Belle Epoque"" instead."
1,"A distinctly unfunny and depressing ""comedy.""","This movie was advertised as a sexy Spanish gem in the tradition of ""Belle Epoque"" or ""Women on the Verge..."", but it lacks Almodovar's verve or Belle Epoque's compassion. The movie's unwholesome message, reinforced in every frame, appears to be nothing more than the proposition that women are harlots and men are pigs."
2,Grainy,"I own a VHS copy of this movie that I bought from an a ""Going out of bussines sale"" store. The quality is O.K. but, I hoped the DVD I just purchased from you would be much better, but I was disappointed. I also own two Region free DVD players set up for this purpose only (I like foreign movies),and I played it in both with same results: Very grainy.Sorry. If I were you, I'd wait until the English US version comes around."
2,"Farcical, visually quite appealing, but uninvolving.","This movie manages to animalize all of its subjects via explicit sex scenes, objectification, poor dialoguing, and overall bad taste in narrative.Not much to say about this one except that it involves a sordid multi-player romance, where everybody behaves in such bizarre yet unsympathetic ways that they inspire only mild disinterest. The one exception, and the movie's only real saving grace, is Penelope Cruz, who makes a scorching love interest; still, she doesn't quite rise above the mess.Some parts are pretty hot (the couple against the skyline, for example), but not worth the whole movie."
3,Worth it only to check out early looks at three stars,"I picked up 'Jamón Jamón' because of all the teasers about it being in the 'style of Almodóvar.' Let's just say that Bigas Luna's tale apparently lost something in the translation.The only reason to rent/buy this film - and it's a pretty good one - is to get an early look at three major stars of Spanish cinema: Jordi Molla, Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz (according to IMDB, they would have been 25, 24 and 19 (!) years old respectively while filming 'Jamón Jamón' in 1993 for a 1994 release).An interesting comparison: watch this film, then follow it up with the 2002 Spanish release 'Second Skin' ('Segunda Piel'), starring Bardem and Molla as protagonists in a *completely different* love triangle. In those 8 - 9 years, there's amazing growth in their acting abilities. 'Jamón Jamón' looks like a school play in comparison."
4,Nude Matadores and Lottsa Ham,"This is a fun film! A black ""who's sleeping with who?"" comedy that draws its viewers into this bizarre, crazed love triangle. Anyone who is a fan of early Almodovar will get something out of this.The acting is great, especially by Bardem. The script has alot of subtle one-liners, and the sex and nudity is explicit and contributes to the anything goes atmosphere. So if you're looking for a fun dark/tragic comedy with lottsa sex, pick this one up."
3,Javier Bardem and Tomas Penco in all their glory.,"Sometimes an aspiring actor has to do a little film to pay the rent or fulfill a contract agreement. What this film shows is how excellent Javier Bardem has become as an actor. He has come along way. Still young Bardem was in great shape. The film might hold your interest in a fun way and the cinematography will hold your attention. I don't mean to embarass the two male actors that are 100 percent nude, but since they probably got a good size paycheck, what the hay. You'll see Javier Bardem pretend bullfighting in blue shorts, then later Javier and Tomas Penco (Tomas Martin) model underwear. Later in the film, Javier Bardem and Tomas Penco decide to have some fun at night time nude bullfighting. These scenes are remarkable to watch because it is a real bull they are teasing. Penelope Cruz and Jordi Molla are also in the film. Javier Bardem and Jordi Molla later starred in SECOND SKIN (2000)"
5,Love this movie,"If you are a Bigas Luna, Penelope Cruz or Javier Bardem fan like I am ... you need to see this movie."
4,Book,This was a Kindle book and came through via Whispernet fine. No problems noted. My daughter ordered this and was satisfied.
2,God Awful brew !!,"If This was a brew,I'd be throwing up!.These guys have the look,but some-one forgot to tell them to write good songs.I'm a big fan of hair metalbut this leaves me wondering how these guys got a contract.UnfortunatelyI bought this."
5,WOW!,"Every single track on this album is absolutely amazing! I love in particular ""Eurydice"", and ""Love/Tragedy"". And what I wouldn't give for Edgar Allan Poe to come alive just for a moment, just so he could hear Rogue reciting ""Annabel Lee"". I believe that it is exactly how he would want it to sound."
5,Absolutely perfect!,"Paradox Addendum is one of the best Cd's I have owned in a long time. The brand new songs are great. and the remixes of other songs are also wonderful. And the spoken word track at the end of the CD is so well read you will have to stop and listen.songs on this Cd that are highly reccomended are ""Eurydice"", ""Love/Tragedy"", ""Ave Maria"" and ""Heavens Gaze"" remix. This is probably one of The Cruxhsadows best works"
4,Lots of Possibility!!!!,"Cut up into short essays, this book shares with you the many experiences and feelings of those involved with the Deaf community. Everything from humor to insight to blood-boiling frustration will hit you as you read this book. Interested in learning about the Deaf community? Learning about different deaf people's experiences? About both sides of the coin? Then this book is perfect for you, easy to read, and well worth your time and money. Highly recommended. That's just this deafie's opinion. :o)"
2,"""not the best book""","I read this book for school. It is the journal of a 13 yr. old girl.Why is it ""not the best book""?1. The story is fairly dull. Most of it is about her everyday life (some people might find that interesting, but I didn't AT ALL)2. The most exciting things that happen in the story, aren't that exciting.3. There is not really a ""climax"" to the story.4. Sometimes, she starts to write about an event in her journal, but never finishes it.5. It is written in 1800's style English, making it hard to understand sometimes.6. It abruptly ends; there isn't really a ""conclusion"" or a wrapping up of her thoughts.These are the reasons that this isn't the best book. I would NOT read it again or for pleasure."
2,BOR-RING,"This book was terribly boring! It was a two-year journal of a 14-year-old girl named Catherine Hall. The spelling of words and grammer were old fashioned(journal written in early 1830's) and I found it hard to understand and I am thirteen! I read alot and I found this book very boring. I couldn't even finish it. The book was 144 pages and I read up to 112. It was too boring to finish. And yes, I did pay attention to the book, but it just wasn't my type."
1,horrid!,"I thought this story was extremely boring! Maybe I'm just a kid (13), but there was no interesting parts. Everyday had a different subject and I couldn't understand the old fashioned language. The author talks about the Phantom in the beginning. Then you think the subject's over, but it comes back suddenly on one of the last page! I can't believe the judjes chose this book as a winner. I only read this because it was part of my class project."
1,UGGH!,"I thought the Gathering of Days was a very boring book, but my mother said I should wait until I am older to read it again. I didn't understand anything that was going on, and I think the author should have explained a few things better. I thought that Catherine was very dramatic. I do NOT recommend this book, but I do have to give the author credit. Some parts were very interesting."
3,a gathering of days,"I had to read this book for school. Over all [I thought] it was a fairly dull book. Nothing that exciting happens. It basically the every-day journal of a 13 yr. old girl.There isn't that much of a climax, and the book abruptly ends. The girl will start writing about an event, and then never finish it.The most exciting parts in the book (they aren't really even exciting) are when the girl starts giving food etc. to a run away slave, secretly. That goes on for a couple entries. Then her father gets re-married...that's basically it.It is written in 1800's style English and hard to understand sometimes. It is also (as I mentioned above) a fairly dull story. Those two things combined, make this not the best book."
2,Ok for school not for fun,"It was an ok book. I think that it takes a very special talent to write a historical journal and this author didn't have it. With a journal you are suppose to write your personal feelings and thoughts. But this author never really wrote Catherine's feelings, which misses a big opportunity to relate to the character. Also with journals normally that have one big problem and then small every day problems. The one big problem is resolved at the end of the book and the small problems are resolved in about a week. A Gathering of Days didn't have every day problems and had three some what big problems that were never drawn out. It is a quick read and great if you are doing a lot of research on that time period with other books. If you are reading this for fun don't bother its not entertaining.~Kenz"
1,Catherine and the phantom,"Catherne writes her diary from 1830 to 1832. She faces many challenges, such as growing up without a mother and losing a dear friend. Catherine can't find her school book. She looks for it everywhere. When she finds the book there is a call for help from a phantom, runnaway slave. Will she help? I didn't like this book very much. The text is a little ""old fashioned"" and the events are pretty boring. It started out with good suspense, but it lost my interest pretty fast. It is an actionless book. So that's why I rated it low."
1,A Gathering of Days,"I did not enjoy reading the book, A Gathering of Days. The entire book uses odd phrasology that detracts from the overall effect of the story. The word choices throughout the book make it very difficult to read and understand. The story is fine in and of itself but I was unable to enjoy the story because of the heavy word usage and poor sentence structures."
1,A tough read,"I'm a middle school teacher and have read loads of teen lit. This is probably the most difficult teen lit book I've ever encountered. The language was so stilted, trying (overtrying really) to sound like ""old-fashioned"" diction. While the story was passable, I found the language to be a major impediment (and I'm an English major, used to the likes of Shakespeare and Milton). I can't imagine any of my students getting out of this book what is actually in it. Unfortunately because of its brief length, well-spaced print and short chapters, I'm afraid my struggling readers will be drawn to it thinking it easy. As a result I'm taking it off my choice book shelf. I can't imagine what the people who set reading level, or who award the Newberry Medal were thinking."
3,It wasn't that good,This was a old fashioned book and was not that good.I could not understand it. It was alright at the end. I would not suggest this book. I had to read it for a book report. I had to use the dictionary just to translate it!
1,Definitely NOT a page-turner,"'A Gathering of Days' had a lot of potential. Catherine went through a lot of conflicts, i.e. the Phantom, Cassie's death etc. But it was just plain boring. I had to force myself to finish it. Maybe I would have liked the book better if it wasn't written in journal form. I don't know. None of the conflicts were portrayed well enough and they all had a very hollow ring. I don't think I would recommend 'A Gathering of Days' to anyone and I will definitely not read this book again."
1,horrid!,"I thought this story was extremely boring! Maybe I'm just a kid (11), but there was no interesting parts. Everyday had a different subject and I couldn't understand the old fashioned language. The author talks about the Phantom in the beginning. Then you think the subject's over, but it comes back suddenly on one of the last page! I can't believe the judjes chose this book as a winner. I only read this because it was part of my class project."
2,Was it worth it?,"I found the book ""A Gathering of Days"" interesting and filled with small pieces of history, but it was hard to comprehend and hard to read. The format of the book, journal entries written by a young girl, is neat, but her usage of out-dated words is odd and it takes time to grasp her meaning. Although this book was directed to a younger audience, I believe that older kids would better understand the phrases and words used. If you are interested in reading and seeing for yourself how life was and how people spoke in the 1800's, this book is perfect. The story was sweet and descriptive, but in my opinion, it is a one-time around book, and did not leave a huge impact on me."
5,Great Buy!,I received my order promptly. I gave it as a Christmas gift and my son was very happy with the purchase.
5,Wow.,"The Zombies were never, ever boring. Consistently engaging and dazzling. ""Zombie Heaven"" was one of the best ideas ever."
4,My daughter loved them!,"I happened upon these by chance for a gift for my 13 yo daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves them! The only problems are that one of the rivets on the inside of the shoe is bent already and pokes her in the foot. Also, one of the peace sign patches is already lifting. I sent an email to amazon but did not have the order # handy. They responded but could not help without the number. I have yet to get back with them which is my fault. Overall, for the length of time that she will fit into these I think they will be ok."
3,KNow what you are getting.,"For all of the Ninth Doctor fans out there be warned this is the less posable toy. It is still a pretty good toy, nice detail and a good likeness of Christopher Eccleston. He is just in kind of an odd pose. If you don't care and you just want a ninth doctor for a good price go for it. However if you want one that is more posable then don't buy this one."
4,Highly recommend this book.,"I am a consultant who uses the techniques in this book. The techniques are straight forward and work well, I like the approach this author used to separate problems analysis into categories that are time based. I recommend this book for all those important decision's a manager or anyone for that matter may need to make."
5,the thinking manager's toolbox,"If you read the book after you've worked with him - you know he's right on the money in the real world. These are not hypothetical ""what ifs"". When you do what the man says your chances of success are dramatically increased."
3,"it's good izzy, but......","i am a huge fan of izzy. during guns, post guns. any izzy is good izzy. his first cd was a truly great album that even the rolling stones themselves could only wish they still had in them. that was a good album. his second disc 117 degrees was an even better album. this one Ride On falls short to me. i love it, but it could have been more. some of the tunes are great. the title track whips along like rock n' roll should. bouncy, a little cocky, and fun. spaced is cool tune reminiscent of rocks-era aerosmith. however highway zero sounds so intense. you can actually see somebody getting chased by the cops while the songs is playing. the rest of the tracks here seem a little under cooked. it's not a total loss, you just feel like the ride on this cd went a bit longer."
5,Mica's Best!,"This disc is just as hot as it was when I picked it up 10 yrs ago! Mica Paris is one of the most underrated artists out there...she's got the vocal range, power, and control and a soulful delivery, and this album fully displays her gifts. While every track on this album is great (from the hip-hop/soul of the title track, which features a rap by Rakim, to the ballad ""Who Can We Blame""), my favorites are ""If I Love U 2 Nite"", ""You Can Make A Wish"", and ""Truth and Honesty"". This album is made up mostly of club-type and mid-tempo cuts, all with a hip-hop vibe. Unfortunately, this CD is out of print, but if you come across it, grab it!!! Believe me, you won't be disappointed."
5,Every French child grows up with these songs,"If you want the exact same children's songs that every child in France grows up with, this is it! I used to have this record when I was a kid and LOVED it! It's wonderful to hear the songs again and to sing along now that I'm 38 years old with my new baby daughter. These are definitely old school style, but I promise that children in my age group heard this record!"
3,Works Well for the size,"As a professional videographer, I needed a way to communicate with my other camera person and I found a 2-way radio but during a wedding I could not have a loud radio going off. After a long search, this earbud headset was recommended. I have used them on two wedding shoots so far and they have work very well.That said, I wish they were not the earbud type. The earbud has a tendency to fall out which can be a pain it if it happens at important moment. I also would have liked to have the mic be a little closer to the earbud because I have reach down and move the mic closer to my mouth to stay quite.Not bad for the price, but it could be better"
3,Cobra Earbuds,"Work great, just wish they were a little tougher made. This is the second set I have had to purchase as the wires are subject to breaking easily. No non-Cobra brands seemed to work, though Radio Shack may have some that might. I discovered them after I purchased these. I use earbuds on my Cobra 2 way radios when hunting with friends.Cobra GA-EB M2 Earbud and Compact Microphone"
5,Works well,The cords are long enough and it is easy to hear well with them. Staff seems to like them and they wipe clean with an alcohol wipe
1,GA-EB M2 ear bud/microphone,"The originals (GA-EB M2) that came with the Walkies failed after 1 yr and they are not comfortable to wear. They are cheaply made, low quality, overpriced. I would like to see someone produce a set with good quality for the CXR925 microtalk radios."
4,Cobra GA-EB M2 Earbud w/compact Microphone,This product works well with the Cobra MicroTalk radio. The earbud is almost too large to fit in my ear but I manage okay. For the price it isn't bad.
4,Heartburn & Reflux for Dummies,"I love all of those ""dummie"" books --- find them easy reading -- and good references. I always pick this one up first when I want advice about acid reflux."
3,Great music for fans of David Vanian,"David Vanian, lead singer for the Damned since 1977, shows off his diverse vocal talents once again. This compilation of tunes is vastly different from the ones heard on the Damned albums of the past. The music has a rockabilly style. For those who like David Vanian's voice, you will not be disappointed. For those who like the Damned as a group and their punk style, you may want to listen to a couple of tracks before you make a purchase, it may or may not be for you."
4,Strong Originals Amongst Some Rough Covers,"Although this CD won't rank as the best of Vanian's career, it shouldn't be overlooked merely because it's not from The Damned (Vanian's legendary punk band). The Man In Drac must be commended for going out on a limb with this one, as the songs are all rockabilly covers along with a few originals. This is as far from ""Machine Gun Etiquette"" as he could probably get.Surprisingly, it's the rockabilly originals that are the best cuts on the album. Songs like ""Voodoo Doll"", ""Big Town"", ""Whiskey and Me"", ""Chase The Wild Wind"" and ""Tonight We Ride"" are straight from the '50s and '60s velvet lounges and biker bars that populate this album. This album has atmosphere, character and big beats that go along great with a glass of bourbon on a lonely summer's night."
3,A rose by any other name?,"After the release of ""Behold and See"", Ultimate Spinach ceased to exist, as Spinach creator / frontman Ian Bruce-Douglas left the band, opting for sanity rather than fame. Problem was, Ultimate Spinach still owed MGM Records another album. Producer Alan Lorber quickly assembled a pick-up band, consisting of Spinach members Barbara Hudson and Russ Levine, Ted Myers and Tony Schueren from the recently-disbanded Chamaeleon Church, and guitarist Jeff Baxter to work under the name.Myers was a credible pop-rock songwriter, but lacked the musical knowledge and vision of Bruce-Douglas. This album isn't as good as the ""real"" Spinach, or even Chamaeleon Church, but does include some good numbers, such as ""Reasons"" and ""The World Has Just Begun"". The album didn't sell though, and Baxter left for Steely Dan, ending the Spinach for good. One song, the countryish ""Sincere"" is missing from this CD, for unknown reasons."
3,so-so,"a warning for those who enjoyed the first 2 ultimate spinach albums- the band is comprised of almost totally different personnel here. that being said this is, in the main, a mediocre rock album. little to nothing on this is psychedelic too.there's a pretty good version of the 60's hit just like romeo and juliet. reasons is a nice ballad that kind of reminds me of something an early 70s singer songwriter would have come up with. some of the other songs are half-good: some days you just cant win and strange life tragicomedy, for instance have interesting parts, but the whole sounds unrealized. this album really sounds like a rush job or a contractual obligation album. nothing on this album is terrible but most of the songs are mediocre at best."
3,good plot but wooden characters,"I generally love dog mysteries, because I love dogs and I love mysteries. Even with that going for it, I found this novel very hard to get into. In fact, I didn't completely finish the book. It was my first book by Berenson, and perhaps I should give another book a try, but I probably won't. The plot was okay, but unfortunately it was just that -- okay. I found the main character Melanie to be somehow emotionless, even at times slightly unlikable. A little more joy in living would have helped this character a lot.The only time the book ever seemed to come a little bit alive was when the dogs became engaged, but it was just lukewarm even then. I'm sure others feel differently about it, perhaps it's just how it strikes the reader."
3,Excellent North Carolina Local Genealogical Study,"The ""Sketch of Lineal Descendants of Samuel Wilson, Sr."" is an excellent genealogical study of several prominent Mecklenburg County, North Carolina families, including some related to General William Lee Davdison, for whom Davidson College was named. The book illustrates the significance of the massive Scotch-Irish immigration into North Carolina, South Carolina and the southeastern United States during the 18th century. Though shown as written by J. B. Eaves, it was actually written by Mrs. John Baxter Eaves. The author was the daughter of a Unionist Confederate congressman who opposed the Secession of North Carolina from the Union in the Civil War. Her husband commanded a company of North Carolina infantry from 1862 until the last major battle of the Civil War at Bentonville, N. C., but became a leading North Carolina Republican during Reconstruction and served twice as state chairman of the North Carolina Reopublican Party."
4,IClean+ Family size,Does a good job cleaning laptop and flat screens. Used in combination with the two microfiber cloths that are provided it will not scratch or streak the surface. I also use it on my camera lenses and eye glasses. I think it is more cost effective to buy the family size bottle. Overall I find iClean a better than average LCD screen cleaner.
4,works for me,"i use this to clean my monitors and my lcd tv. looks very clean and free of dust. i do agree taht there seems to leave some streaks here and there but unless you are sitting 1 inch from your TV, looking at it sideways when the screen is black, you will never notice."
3,Still leaves streaks....,"I researched this product for about 2 weeks before I actually bought it, for my brand new LED TV. I was very meticulous in cleaning my TV with this product. I turned off the lights in my living room and used a LED flashlight to actually see all of the dust on my LED TV. With the lights off and by using my LED flashlight, while cleaning my TV, I could see streaks left by this product. I'm not sure if there is anything that's ""streak free"", that is not damaging to my TV. I have to admit, I was disappointed to see streaks when I shined my LED flashlight on my TV after cleaning it.Try it yourself. By using an LED flashlight, with your living room lights turned off, you can literally see EVERYTHING that's dirtying up your TV. Including the streaks left behind by this product. But of course, you can't see the streaks sitting 10 feet away from the TV."
1,Don't waste your money,"Save yourself $10 and buy a jar of mayonnaise, you'll get the same results smearing that all over your screen. Guess I shouldn't be surprised buying a product from a company known for selling (scamming) overpriced ""premium"" audio cables. A one star review is the lowest you can give. It's also generous for this product."
5,Good Nursing Home Care,"""Good Nursing Home Care"" by Patty Robinson is a powerful and invaluable work for the new millennium. This is step by step guide dealing with significant nursing home health care issues. Her own family experience and extensive career background make this book and extraordinary guide. Life is a series of profund events through which we all must pass and dealing with loved ones which meed continouous care is the most arduous endeavor we face in todays world. This book is timely and gives us a road map to discern, confront and resolve problems we face to protect and care for our loved ones in the nursing home environment."
1,The artwork is HIDEOUS!,"I bought this deck for my young cousin, who loves fairies. Many of these cards were so disturbing, that I couldn't even show them to her. When I showed it to her grandma, she said, ""WHERE'S THE FAIRIES?""We aren't fairie experts or anything, and we never looked at the book, so there may be much more to it. We just couldn't get over the ugly artwork on most of the cards. These cards were not shown in the preview."
5,True Insight from the Faeries,"You will not be disappointed by this deck. This is the most amazingly accurate deck I have ever used. Appropriate even for folks that ""don't believe in this kinda stuff"" If you are looking for detailed and insightful assistance...this is the deck."
5,Brought Me Even Closer to the Fae,"Faery Oracle is by far my favorite tarot deck (out of the pitiful two that I own).It's probably my favorite because I find faery magic so interesting and yet amusing, and the Fae depicted on the cards have been wonderful to me. In the past, they've brought me a great deal of closure concerning my earnest life questions.If you are seeking wisdom and guidance, the path of faery faith just might be what you're looking for."
5,The most BEAUTIFUL deck,"I own this deck of Tarot cards and the pictures are amazingly beautiful. The guide book is very easy to use, and I very well written. The cards are of the best quality as well [No fading, or scratches after use] and I would recommend it to any one who is a lover of the Faeries."
5,Amazing! A must have.,"I love these Oracle Cards. The material is perfect, thick and well made. The art work is crazy amazing, beyond beautiful, Brian Froud really takes you to another realm with these cards. This is my second time buying these from Amazon, and like last time they arrived fast and in perfect condition. I Love The Faeries Oracle by Brian Froud, I recommend."
5,Beauty and Majik!,I bought this for a friend and now I want one for myself! The cards are just enchanting and the art is incredible. A definite winner in all respects.
5,They are beautiful,"The cards are differant, you need to read the book before you try using the cards. They aren't cutsie fairies either, but differant. Nice book easy to read comes with the cards."
5,Gorgeous!,"Not your ordinary oracle. If you want something that is not only beautiful but allows you a little more intuition and synchronicity than tarot decks, you've come to the right place. The words prompts are simple and thought-provoking, the artwork is beautiful and rich with details that you might notice one little thing during one reading and another the next time. the possibilities are endless."
2,Where are the cards?,I also received this book without the cards. Does anyone have any idea on where to find them? I've done a search and can't come up with anything? Please help!
4,Excellect!,This is an amazing set! The pictures are beautiful and the book is very helpful. You'll love this set.
5,I have used this set for years.,This oracle set is great. The art work on the cards is beautiful. This set comes with a complete deck of 66 oracle cards and a complete 208 page illustrated book. This set helps you look at yourself and helps give a better understanding of ones self. It pervades a clear look into your personal problems and it also gives a clear look into the future and it gives you ideas of some different paths you can take to change the outcome of whatever issue you are currently faced with. The cards are very easy to use. the readings are clear and each card is numbered and in the book it will tell you the meanings of each card. These cards have never let me down I would recommend this set to anyone who wishes to have guidance and perspective in your life. the cards will know your energy after about three uses. The cards are just fun and make a very good heirloom gift.
5,Best oracle I ever owned,"I went through several tarot decks until I found this one. I brought it for myself as a 16th birthday present, years ago. I fell in love immediately. The artwork on the cards is beautiful and the book is full of exercises to get you familiar with the cards. It also has great descriptions of each card's meaning.I've owned this deck for 8 years, and not once have I had a problem with it. I believe each person just has to find out what works for them, so I can't say it will definitely work for everyone, but it's never once let me down. I treasure these cards probably more so than anything else I have. And so do my friends! They love getting readings from them.If you're interested in the Faerie and are thinking of trying them out, I highly recommend them."
5,Highly Informative,"This book contains a lot of great basic information and numerous exercises for expanding your psychic awareness. Also, the descriptions of the various chakras are excellent. I had no idea for example that we all have hand and feet chakras, as well as four chakras above and below us. I also discovered each person's aura is quite complex with several different layers that correspond to each chakra.The book's first chapter starts off not surprisingly with grounding exercises, running earth and cosmic energy. Always good to start with basics. The next chapter discusses the various chakras. Subsequent chapters discuss topics like distinguishing your energy from others, cords and how to ""dissolve"" them, ""screens,"" aura layers and repairing them if needed.I found the book along with all the various exercises, to be fascinating and plan to refer to it often in the future as I expand my psychic awareness."
3,All The Information One Needs,"While this book does provide a lot of information, I found it to be tedious and technical in its presentation. The author provides only one way to do each exercise and each reads more as a cooking recipe than an inspired guide to psychic and spiritual awakening. (The author literally prescribes mixing 90% cosmic energy with 10% earth energy during your meditation!) It's a good addition to a library on psychic development but I found it limited in its usefulness for day-to-day use, especially for someone just beginning their journey."
2,Not for me....,"I bought this book and this book: The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your SoulBasic Psychic Development is ok, not really my style. The second book I bought is amazing!"
5,Thee Best!,"This book is so interesting and easy to read, i acctually have a hard time putting it down to do the exercises described! It builds up to psychic abilitys which is important. If you think you can become a psychic over night it's not going to happen. But with this book you will aquire the skills needed to grow your abilitys!"
5,"TNA celebrates it's 5th birthday in Nashville, Tennessee","I like the cover art on this DVD. It's a take off on the Johnny Cash ""Walk The Line"" poster. Instead of Johnny Cash we've got Jeff Jarrett on the poster now. Jeff didn't actually wrestle at Slammiversary however.I was at this event in Nashville, TN. It was a good pro wrestling pay-per-view.I got a kick out of watching the DVD extra that showed the fans at the T.N.A. Fanfest standing in line and then later meeting the wrestlers. I met Kevin Nash and Kurt Angle there. WWE should do the same thing before every PPV.Hard to believe that this PPV marked the five-year anniversary of TNA. I loved it when they ran a PPV every Wednesday night at the Nashville Fairgrounds."
1,Dustin Runnels.....savior,"WWE is a funk right now. TNA has the answers! Sting didnt bring much to the ratings game, neither did a reformed Steiner Brothers team or the greatest wrestler in the world, Kurt Angle. RVD is probably coming over soon and maybe, just maybe Chris Jericho. They found the star that will lead them into the next twenty years, the greatest superstar of the past ten years, DUSTIN RUNNELS! Can you smell the ratins already?"
5,"""Anatomy of Success is a wonderful book!","As a Division Sales Manager for a major liquor distributor in the Chicagoland area, I was able to apply the concepts that I learned in the book ""Anatomy of Success."" These concepts helped me to communicate more effecectively with my customers as well as my salesforce. There is alot of material in this book that would help improve the lives of many people. I only wish this book was available years ago so I could have been wiser back then."
3,my sons gift,"My son received this book as a gift and is really enjoying it. What was really great is that the estimated delivery time was so far ahead it was too cruel to think it would take that long. As it was, the gift arrived in time for his birthday after all and he was estatic. keep up the good work"
1,"Dull, boring and lengthy","I have read numerous books on reading the Tarot, and this book is the worst that I have ever seen. The descriptions of the cards did not ring true for me, and the authors assumed too much on the part of the reader. I did not find it enlightening in the least, and would not recommend this book."
5,"Uncomplicated, insightful","This is a great book, a great starter how-to manual! It makes Tarot accessible. Although I've been ""trying"" to read the cards for years, I'd never bothered to read more than the Little White Books that came with the decks I'd collected. THIS book showed me how much more one can get out of Tarot.The only flaw I've found so far is that they throw the Celtic Cross at you without enough preparation, before explaining what each position in the spread is all about...if I were an absolute newcomer to Tarot that would probably have intimidated me. If you have not been exposed to Tarot much before, maybe that's a section you should skip and come back to. But I must give the book 5 stars because of how much it's helped me. Don't let this be the ONLY book you read, but I do think it's a Must Read for beginners. :)"
1,Package is really suck! it didn't protect the product.,"Length:: 0:26 MinsI just received 10 crystal balls, I can't believe the package just use a thin bubble bag,Don't even consider the product is crystal,it shouldn't use that poor package to ship out the product."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"For $4.98 and free shipping, I didn't expect much. This item arrived fast. It's really huge. I'd agree with the person who said the drilled hole area might could've been better. But it's so minor, it's not worth worrying over, especially for the price. There are lots of facets and it looks great in the window. It came with some monofilament attached, which I cut off to make it longer."
4,Nice size,Got 4 of them just before Christmas a perfect addition for our tree. Bigger than what I was expecting. Great price
3,Disappointed,"I really like the crystal, but I am very disappointed that it has a chip in it. I realize nothing is perfect, but they should really check each item before they send it off to a customer. It is one thing if I chip it when I get it, but to come chipped is no excuse. I dont want the hassle of trying to return it so I am keeping it and I just hope no one notices. If I had more time, I would return it and ask for one that is not chipped!!!"
3,Cliched Drama to the Core,"Liddy is having an extremely bad week - job loss, philandering husband, no sex in 5 years with him and suddenly pregnant. For a woman about to turn 50, Liddy's life seems like the life of a twenty something turned decidedly sour.While the book has redeeming value as a light read, Clare has used a dictionary of cliche's to come up with an over the top story. A controlling older daughter, a bulemic younger daughter and a gay son - the situation is completely predictable. The most vived characters in the book are the 90-something lesbian great-aunts Cleo and Cyn. In the mess of everything that's happened, all Liddy wants is to make things right with her husband who feels he needs to decide between her and his lover. (Honestly, would you take a cheating man back?)Although the book is very predictable, I actually enjoyed the light, simple read - I could even understand the British vocab. Not bad if you don't want something as depressing as Oprah picks."
1,(...)!GREEN TURDS!,"Konami,why did you make this crap.The jackass at your work place,huh?I know your a good game company.Fire the guy who thought of making a game with the talking snot."
2,Father and Son(s) perspective,"Dad found the game to be too easy, highly repetitive, and thus pretty boring. Additional character scripting would have been great (after the first 30 minutes, I had to either mute the volume or go in the other room). It also makes absolutely no sense to me as to why the game is a two-player fest only, when it was absolutely a natural for up to four players.My 5 year-old twins, on the other hand, loved it and couldn't put it down. Unfortunately there isn't much available on the X-box for young kids. Is it a violent game? Yes. Is it mild afternoon cartoon violence that the kids have seen before? Yes."
1,poorly done,I was willing to overlook many shortcomings in this game such as repetitive one-liners... but the one thing that destroys this game is that you can't save unless you finish all five or six areas in a level...which is ANNOYING. Hopefully Konami will clean this up in the next game.
3,a casualty of its times,"this record veers wildly from sorta great to just plain awful, it's hard to believe the same guy wrote all this. his singing rots though and for crying out loud those lyrics are the worst ever. ""bananas hanging out of their ears"", indeed."
2,Beautiful Disapointment,"The Product looks great, and fits and fall on my wrist perfectly. The Huge problem this item has is that the clip to lock it comes off so easily. The first time I wore it, it came off twice that night. Luckily I found it on the floor; so I put it on my pockets for the rest of the night. Since I like the look and it falls great on my wrist. Now I have to use a small band aid to secure it. I don't recommended for that reason."
2,Well not exacty!!,"I was kind of dissapointed. I did order the book and got it promptly, but it was for the wrong state. I live in AZ NOT CA. So while I didn't pay an excessive amount of $ for it, I didn't get what I was looking for either!!A word to the wise: Don't buy a book from CA if you live in another state."
4,"straightforward, no fluffy stuff","I'm comparing this to the stack of other books I've had to buy for my paralegal education. This one is pretty awesome by comparison because it gets right to the point. If there's any repetition, there's very little of it. I've come away knowing exactly what's required to be in each kind of legal document described (except for the issue of guardianship in a will - the book's not crystal clear on that).Overall, this was a good buy."
4,Wonderful Resource,Great Resource for anyone interested in Legal work....full of information for all kinds of work from Legal Assistant to Paralegal to Legal Secretary.
4,Flapless in Seattle,"When my son was about 8 months old, I picked this book up ... to keep him occupied. He just loved it -- and still does. The spine is now pretty chewed up from all the ""love"" it got during teething. However, at 23-months, he still loves to read this book -- even though he removed 7 out of 12 the flaps some months ago.Aside from the fun of flap-lifting (and ultimately, flap-tearing), we have fun reading it together pointing to and counting the items on each page: 7 eggs, 4 boats, 5 lily pads, etc. It's also great for talking about colors and 'big and small'.I just wish there was a way to make the flaps rip-proof!"
1,"Fine, if you believe everything the government tells you.","I found this book dated and misleading. I was especially concerned with the advice to drink plenty of fluoridated tap water. More evidence is available that shows fluoride is dangerous, especially to pregnant women and babies.And it may be safe to eat processed cheese, but I wanted a book centered around a diet that avoids processed foods. Disgusting.I found the information in other popular ""Expecting"" books to be more complete for preferences towards natural diets."
3,Jusk OK,"This book limits itself to food when everyone knows there's a lot more to pregnancy than what you eat. I would recommend getting an all-inclusive pregnancy book like ""What to expect when you're expecting"" because it completely covers what to eat as well as a lot of other helpful information that this book leaves out."
5,Good to have in emergency first aid kits.,"I strongly believe that every one needs to have a fully equipped First Aid Kit in their home as well as in their car. I have put together several kits for myself and my family and I am constantly adding new items to them. After several surgeries this past year, I found the gauze sponges to be the best for protecting wounds and keeping them clean and dry. These sponges work well on smaller wounds and are conveniently sized for my first aid kits."
2,It served its purpose...kinda,"If you've ever seen a 'normal' packet of 200 count gauze, you'd be surprised to see these packets which are half the size of a normal packet of gauze. I was looking for a thin, unfilled gauze to apply a facial toner that came in a small bottle and was quite pricey. Cotton balls used too much product so I was looking for a product like this. Thin it was, but density was thinner than cheesecloth requiring you to use two. I work in healtcare and prob should have ordered from our supplier because the filled and unfilled gauze is a much higher quality. Disappointed. It does the job using two pieces but wasn't quite what I was looking for."
1,"Picketts Charge, The Last Attack at Gettysburg","I agree that the Battle of Gettysburg and Pickett's charge were actual events; However the rest of this book is fiction.General Lee is the one who ordered Picketts Charge, not General Longstreet. Longstreet knew this attack was going to fail, and told him so. Longstreet and Lee butted heads more then once during this tragic battle. To the author, try to study history before you attempt to write it."
5,Meat,"One of the most influential albums on me. I remember first obtaining an Italian import of this in the late 80s and thinking it was so chunky. Everything about it was blissfully low-tech, including the practically photocopied looking b/w cover. Having only heard ""Globe of Frogs"" at the time, it also exposed me to the more disturbing (and hilarious) dimensions of Robyn's songwriting talents. From the jubilant ""The Man Who Invented Himself"" to the ridiculous ""Policemen Sing"". And, hey, Thomas Dolby even crops up (as Robyn would later do on ""The Flat Earth"").Often categorized as a Syd Barrett wannabe (which might be true) or worse, a novelty act, Robyn is so much more than that. His massive career, spanning from the late 70s to this day is a testament to both his talent and stamina.My one complaint on the CD re-release is that missing sax on ""The Who Invented Himself"". We are told that this was a ""single version"" which was substituted on subsequent pressings. Well, it was a bit better ..."
5,Another one for my Collection.,Musical genius.Also bought this cd to replace a tape bought yrs ago.Love the cool tones mixed with trippy tones.A must have.
1,Waste Your Money and Learn Very Little,"I returned this book three days after buying it, it was so bad. It is riddled with computing errors, typos and really terrible writing. The few useful things in the book can be _easily_ picked up off the web for free. The author seems to be a Johnnie-Come-Lately to hacking, has no in-depth knowledge and is just trying to make a buck. This is not a good book even for newbies."
1,Complete and Utter Garbage,"Please, don't waste your money on this terrible book. The information is dated, and most of the information can be found on the internet. You find anything of value in this entire book."
3,decent.....,"As, I look over these reviews, I can't help but wonder how many of these slobs who voted one star actually read the book. And if they did, how many actually understand anything about computers..."
5,A great book for begining hackers.,"This was an excellent book. It was really good for teaching the basics, and teaching that true hackers don't break the law, or cause damage. I would recomment this book to anyone who wants to become a hacker."
1,"Neither Happy, Nor Hacking.","Somewhere in this collection of Windows 95 tricks and re-digesting of commonly available information regarding certain Internet protocols, there's a good hacker book waiting to come out. The problem is, between all the mis-information and grammatical errors (of which there's plenty), you get the feeling that ""The Happy Hacker"" isn't so much a guide to becoming a white hat hacker as it is somebody's way of making a quick buck off the hacker hysteria. Do yourself a favor: spend the money on any one of the books published by ""O'Reilly and Associates"" on things like security, running and using Linux, or various protocols and programs that make up the Internet. Or, spend the money renting WarGames. At least then you'll know how 70's hackers got free local phone calls from payphones."
2,More entertainment than serious work.,"Not the greatest (as some would have you believe), but not the worst, either. The deliberately poor spelling is sometimes an annoyance. Otherwise, easy to read. I'd probably think it was great if this was my first exposure to the subject and I was thirteen. Definite juvenile tone. Not too bad if all you want is basic techniques, but nothing that can't be found elsewhere."
1,This book is not for people who use computers,"I was very dissapointed with this book. Instead of taking it to a used book seller I threw it in the trash so that no one else could read it.The technical knowledge was sub sub-average. Examples of ""hacking"" windows 95 were pathetic. This is deplorable. Not even reference to Microsoft related publications or how to obtain the correct references so that the user doesn't damage their system. Even worse, suggestions to ""re-install"" every time a problem occurs. What kind of joke is that.It got worse with the summation on things such as port scanning, TCP/IP descriptions, even the ""common-sense"" warnings were wrong. Instead of reading this, why not learn to program in C or C++ and write drivers or help secure machines against attacks.This book leads people in the wrong direction and its author obviously doesn't know the material."
1,A complete and utter waste..,"..of time, money, trees and ink. If you believe that a very basic Windows 95/98 knowledge coupled with an even more limited knowledge of a few Unix shell commands equates to hacking, then by all means buy spend the thirty bucks and join the author in her fantasy world. You deserve each other.On the positive side, someone has finally managed to write a book more ridiculous than ""Secrets of a Super Hacker"". Way to go.For those interested in ""hacking"", try books from O'Reily & Associates, and pick up a copy of _The New Hacker's Dictionary_ by Eric S. Raymond, and remember: Friends Don't Let Friends Read The Happy Hacker!"
2,Bad would be an understatement,"This has got to be the worst book in my library. There isn't any hard information. You do get a whole lot of hints and teasers but little in the way of a clear explanation. Spend your money elsewhere. Not only is Bellovin and Cheswick's Firewall's and Internet Security so much better, you'll also be spared from suffering through very juvenile writing."
4,"A perfectly FINE book, darn it.","I am not a computer wizard by any stretch of the imagination. I am a nice girl with secret dreams of hackerdom, and as such, I found this book educational and enjoyable. After reading halfway through it, I've already learned many useful things about computers, and discovered some nifty tricks to impress my less technologically literate friends. No, it didn't teach me anything really complex, or anything I couldn't have found on the Internet, but that's alright. It was useful to have all the information available in one, easily understandable and locatable source, and nice to have it in a form that I could read during lunch or in bed. Although it's definitely aimed at newbies like me, it isn't nearly as simplistic or stupid as other reviewers have made it out to be (I have to wonder whether they've actually read it . . .). Carolyn Meinel's _The Happy Hacker_ is both a good instructor and a good read."
1,Useless is an understatement,"This book is pure nonsense.For a start it is worded very badly.pg 30 :::""When you get the kind of online connection that allows you to see pretty pictures on the Web, you are using TCP/IP""Come on please! At least explain that it is HTTP.Thats the writing of a ""computer security expert""?? I don't think so.If you want to learn about hacking go and get the Hacking exposed books. I am not saying that they are amazing but I certainly learnt more from them in the first chapters then in all of Happy Hacker."
1,Don't waste your money or time on this one!,I am sure Carolyn P. Meinel is happily pocketing the money from the revenues of her exorbitantly priced book.Not to mention her facking positive reviews to promote this book.The joke is that this is the 3rd edition of the book.Wake up people. Read something more instructing.I even over rated this book by giving it 1 star...my 2c
1,The Happy Hacker,"I have not actually read the book itself, but, to my knowledge, ""hacking"" (the process of breaking into someone else's computer files...) is considered an illegal activity in the U.S. and Canada... Just a thought, before you go and read the book..."
1,a ridiculous book written by a ridiculous person,"I'm horrified to see that there are actually people out there (like the reader from Ohio) who give this book more than one star. I pitty those people who can actually learn from this book, because that means that they have no technical knowledge at all. And a word about the author: this self-proclaimed security consultant wasn't even able to protect her website techbroker.com against Hacking For Girliez...well, what can be expected of someone who doesn't even understand the difference between a FIN-scan and a half-scan...Carolyn you're pathetic, please stop...thanks"
3,Great for newbie,"It's a great book, for beginers. It explains what are ports and showes you a little of programming in c and shell, but not a allot. Funy book. If you are a beginer, you should read it."
3,"this book is ok, for nubies.","Well, what's there to say...This book is ok for nubies, it dont give out enough information, and has too much ""junk"" writen in it.You don't need to spend the money on it unless you know nothing or little at all.My advice would be to skip this book if you know how to change your background, and read maximum security (allthoe still not the ""master"" book) it will teach you WAY more than this one, for almost the same price."
1,A complete waste of money,"This book is a complete waste of money. You won't learn anything new from it. It's very poor, technically incorrect, bad writen and absolutely boring. I can't believe it made it into print."
1,Who says garbage is cheap?,"This book proves that anyone can get a book published if they either have the money themselves or sleep with someone who does. I can't honestly review the entire book as I could not force myself to read the entire thing. After a few chapters I did not know wether to cry over having wasted a hour of my life on something so worthless, or to laugh that someone might actually think this book is informative. The contents are both inaccurate and useless. A ""hacker"" does not need help changing his windows95 background I assure you. Skip this by all means...."
1,Some people will buy anything.,"How astonished I am that Amazon is offering this in the book section! I am even more surprised to see it come up as a suggested book. I don't read joke books, and I like my fiction to be better written than this.It is certainly fitting that the average reader that bought this book also bought ""Secrets of a Super Hacker; Knightmare, et al."" We all know how deep the secrets are in that one.I'm an actual security professional, and female, and That Creature offends me by her very existence. Get help, Carlolyn."
1,One of the worst books on the subject ever written,"This book is reprints of guides freely available on the web, ithas numerous technical errors and it is confusing..."
2,Dr Anne Andersen,"This was rather a disappointing book, given the ""hype"" that surrounds it.There were one or two interesting chapters, but it written for ""newbies"" and I'm afraid most of the information was out-of-date.Anybody could get this information, and more up-to-date ""stuff"", reading Phack and trawling the Web.Nothing about the virus Chernobyl, and its offspring, Colossus, used by the UK and US military, to blast unwanted intruders.On a more basic level where is the info on Back-Orifice?. In the Psychology Dept at Glasgow University, we have protection , via firewalls and Norton's anti-virus software.Meinel doesn't address the issue as to how these packages work,with ""all"" her writings and self indulgence, she doesn't say that these systems are virtually hacker-proof.How do they work?.Next time she writes a book on this subject, lets hope she goes up-market, instead of pandering to spotty faced youths, hiding away in bedrooms.She is capable of better things, if she wasn't on an ego trip! ."
1,WOW... Garbage.,You will learn nothing from this book that you can't get anywhere else free... It's not even the interesting stuff about OS's security. This is a GARBAGE book.
1,the more you use the net the less you need the book,there are a ton of resources on the net ... and gasp ... not for profit .
2,Not as it seems,"This book is less than informative. It is also extremely outdated. I advise anyone who is thinking of purchasing this to think twice. This will not aid anybody in the process of becomming a ""hacker"". I will say that is an interesting read. That is about as positive as I can get with it though. Carolyn Meinel preaches that she will teach you to ""legaly hack"" For those thinking that hacking is just about breaking into computers need to get a serious reality check. Don't waist your time buying this book. All the information in this book is although useless but widely available online. If you really wish to learn something of use. Consider buying books on linux / different programming languages. Books of such will lead you more in the right direction than ""The Happy Hacker"" will."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I'm sorry but this book just sucked, surely the author does not even know how to hack or maybe even turn on her computer. This book will teach you nothing, u'll find more on the net."
4,"An entertaining beginner's guide, but far from comprehensive","I purchased this book, along with several others, to get a better understanding of the 'code kiddiez' I have to deal with at my job with an online gaming company. Meinel's book is the one I return to time-and-again for a humorous, entertaining introduction to a subject, and after I've exhausted what she has to say, I crack open the dry texts on systems security to learn more. If you know how to play with e-mail, read headers, run a shell account, edit a Windows 95 registry, and use basic Unix commands, then don't bother with this book. If you're new to these subjects, however, Meinel will give you a good head start, and on the basis that the book does what it attempts to do well, I give it four stars."
1,This book disgraces the trees used for it's paper.,"I've never read something that was such a blatant attempt to capitalize off of an esoteric topic. Under the guise of a ""hacker manual"", this book will teach you nothing; except that your money would have been better thrown in the street. Don't support egotistical crackfiends.""Rt66 vice president Mark Schmitz took the initiative to donate equipment, the use of a T1, and the expertise of Rt66's computer security gurus."" -- Security gurus that do not understand the value of backups."
1,"Meinel, tell me darling, what is this?","Meinel, if you ever read this review, please answer it. Why was koan shut down for good when HFG hacked it... OH! Oops, the public wasn`t supposed to know about that! But of course, Tg0d did, and so did I. Coincidence? I think not. You are too cowardly to admit that you`re incompetent and cannot fix your own FreeBSD box. What, your goons ran away? Nobody to do it for you?"
1,her version of security might as well be an iMAC,"Anyone who 1)pays money for this book, nd 2)thinks they got their money's worth, is obviously not a hacker, and has certainly taken the wrong step to making them one. Hackers don't write books like this, and more to the point, you don't gain security, and ha'x'or skillz be not ever breaking the law, I would rather read the dictionary than read this book. Anyone would probably learn more that way too..."
3,not good but not bad...so so,"This book is not bad. This is the first book that let you have a peek into how to do hacking. Carolyn shows you how to use Unix to have a peek at other remote computer. She does not show you how to break into other computers in detail. Other Unix book is dry and boring. But, Carolyn will show you what Unix commands are available for you to use. Anyway, I like this book. Price is a bit steep. I'm having fun poking around with this book. If you expect to learn something useful and do something with this book, DONT buy it. Conclusion: For newbie, this book is good enough. If you know something about Unix, better PASS this book (dont waste your money.)"
2,Just the begining,"After having read this book from cover to cover I can honestlysay that I didn't learn anything from it that I didn't know before.Also all the information in this book, about, what she calls, ""hacking"" is extremly vague as to how it might be applied to serious hacking, and is pretty useless except for those barebone begininers out there.In my personal opinion save your self some money, you can read it on-line or save the files and print them out. I guarentee that it'll be cheaper than then the $30 they want from you here. (Buy a real book Internet Besieged)"
1,"A waste of time, money and paper","The book is a waste of time to read to even brouse though andhas nothing to do with Hacking or any related art. The Author appearsto have no concept of computer science or a basic understanding of security in todays world. One chapter talks to turning you windows 95 system into a hacker box, but all the chapter talked about was applying stickers to your notbook computer and changing the background image to look more Gen-X. This book is content free and has nothing to do with computer security or the any of its related fields."
1,Experimentation with the wrong materials,This CD makes my head hurt and doesn't ask me where it's at. The vocals are redundant and the sounds just don't bring me anywhere. I thought the first CD was interesting and was looking to see what their next direction was and think they found the wrong way.
2,Jaxx has an unmistakable sound,"Basement Jaxx has always had a unmistakable sound to their music, and it's continually evolved. It's something that's not the easiest thing to do and they should be commended for it. ""Remedy"" was a near masterpiece, and ""Rooty"" was almost as good. Heck, even their ""atlantic jaxx recordings"" complimation had some great work. ""Kish Kash"" continues this ""evolution"", but is not a stand out performance. In fact, there isn't even a ""outstanding"" song on the album. Maybe all the guest appearances take your mind off finding the ""great"" song on the album. Maybe they just raise your expectations. ""Kish Kash"" isn't a bad album, but it's not one that you're going to go out of your way to play either."
2,their worst cd,"the only good song is tonight, a song you would expect from them. everything else is just poorly cut up pop-rap beats on top of bad songs."
3,1/2 stars,"This album is very good, it has a new sound, it's own creativity, but the songs can sometimes be a bit dull, and annoying. Overall an all right cd, but could have been something a lot better."
2,Where's the reset button on this thing?,"I have been following the basement jaxx since the release of their first album, and i believe that this is their poorest effort yet. This album is plagued with bad vocals, disjointed beats, off key synths, and music that you just cant seem to get interested in.While the music style is similar to that of their previous albums, this cd is void of any particular songs that merit you to go out and buy it, and certainly does not contain any that are radioworthy. If you were a fan of the past two albums, then this one will be right up your alley as the style is almost identical, but if you were like me and would only pop the older albums in for select songs, go ahead and pass this one by. You wont be missing much.Notable songs on this cd:If I ever recoverTonightFeels like home"
4,Definately their worst album... now note my rating,"Yes, this is their worst album to date. But it's still utterly amazing. As with every Basement Jaxx CD, the tracks that are good, RULE. The tracks that are not so good, SUCK.It's polar opposites. There's never been an 'okay' Basement Jaxx tune.I think what has happened here is that the Jaxx have gotten too complex for the mainstream. The beats on previous albums were easy to find, and not very layered. Well... that's a lie. They are layered, but not THIS deep. Kish Kash has thousands of layers per track, to the point where there's so much going on that you lose yourself in it.So this is their worst effort.It's still worth buying.Plug it in, baby!"
4,Motorvating,"The criteria for assessing dance CD's is such a subjective thing - certainly more objective than straighter rock genres which share basic blues structures, etc. With dance, it often comes down to what motorvates you. So, in that respect, I can tell you that Basement Jaxx's third CD, Kish Kash, is a mish mash of dance styles that lights me up just fine. I like it more than their debut, maybe even a bit more than Rooty. Because they utilize outside vocalists, their CD's share the sensibilities of worldwide DJ mixes. Because they aren't afraid of guitars, they reach out and grab a rock fan's heart. And because they have lives outside the clubs, they keep songs at normal lengths - no interminable 15-minute mixes here. MeShell Ndegeocello's cuts are sensual; Siouxsie Sioux's (the title track) sets her up for a comeback; J. C. Chasez's (the erotic ""Plug It In"") proves again that there was more talent in N'Sync than anyone wants to admit. And the skits are lame."
5,HOT,"Basement Jaxx have fallen into a pattern of releasing brilliance with every album out. Case in point: Remedy was a house classic, simply brilliant. Follow-up Rooty was a ambitious dabble in acid jazz and disparate influences. Their new album Kish Kash is on another level altogether. Although I haven't heard it enough (just once) to properly commentate, I can say from a first impression that it is banging! JC's contribution is actually really good, his voice fits well over the Jaxx beats, and Dizzee Rascal is spectacular as always. I like ""Good Luck"", ""Lucky Star"" ""Plug It In"" and the relaxing ""Feels Like Home"", but I have a feeling this entire album will grow on me in the next few weeks. Jack your body YEAH!"
2,Dissappointed,Ok So I love Rooty and Remedy. They are both great cd's which I loved the first time I heard them. So when I heard Basement Jaxx was releasing a new album I ran out to get it. I put it on and after listening to it about halfway I had to get the cd sleeve out and make sure that it was the same band. Yeh all the same type production was there but just not the fun. There was nothing that really stood out even after 5 listens. I guess if you like hip hop you might like this album more but if your looking for the fun dance music of the past dont look here. I am sorry to ruin its perfect rating and maybe down the road I will put the CD in and be like this is awesome but as for first impressions and expectations i was let down.
4,It's all about winning the war,"Basement Jaxx has always been the most diverse dance music team. Far more risk taking than either Chemical Brothers or Fatboy Slim. Probably only Leftfield is more exotic. It's all about moving your body. The first two Basement Jaxx records were very different from each other. There is a lot of hard driving disco on most of their records. Kish Kash is probably more heavy funk than their past records. For this new sound they get singers Meshell Ndegeocello, JC Chasez, and Dizzee Rascal. JC Chasez rips it up on ""Plug It In"" and sounds like a Michael Jackson at his best in the process. Siouxsie Sioux sings the title track that sounds like a hyped up punk track, much like The Prodigy. Siouxsie sounds most unlike herself in years. Meshell Ndegeocello is the standout singer on her two songs, especially ""Right Here's The Spot."" A definite winner."
2,Kind of a Drag,"Two great tracks-Cish Cash w Siouxsie Sioux, and Lucky Star w Dizzie Rascal. Sorry folks, thats about it. The rest could of easily been lifted off a JLo CD, and that's about as mainstream blandy bland as you can get. Although Cish Cash is the coolest, freshest song written in years."
4,great cd,"well i have to admit that on my first listen of Kish Kash i wasnt to happy with kish kash but after one or two listens I think this cd is amazing. Not quite as good as rooty i would have to admit but close, but slightly better than remedy. You may not like it at first but listen to the whole cd a couple of times and you will agree that this is an exceptionaly great cd."
3,Lame Psychedelic Pop,"A curious but cornball mix of psychedelic pop and skits. Musically, it is like the Doodletown Pipers (if that reference helps) mixed with skits and voice overs. The jokes are horrid and the voice work uninspiring. Brainchild of ad agency hacks who thought they were more. Does feature electronic music by Moog himself. So it may be historically interesting but not that entertaining."
1,"Might as well tap the wall, this Zircon doesn't detect wall studs","This is a piece of junk. During home improvement projects, we have found our Zircon StudSensor to be completely unreliable for detecting wall studs, and I ended up throwing this away. You might as well flip a coin. The studfinder is measuring ""something"" during slow sweeps across drywall since it will indicate the presence of a ""stud"" at the same point at the wall, but over half the time there's nothing there."
1,Deep scan readings were unreliable,"I was using the tool on deep scan setting over a single-layer vinyl floor. Finder did not give the same result when I repeated ANY reading several times--got both false positives and negatives and usually a lot of 'noise.' I could clearly see the joists from the floor below and even using that knowledge I was not able to trust the Zircon. Also, there are no instructions with the tool for installing the battery and the information on the website was wrong. Booo.Finder did not work at all over my carpeted area.Finder seemed to work better when I did some limited trials on the wall studs.Bottom line: I could not trust the tool and am returning it."
1,Complete Junk,"I found this product to be complete junk, and never even had it powered on. Simply getting to the battery caused another piece inside to fall out. So I had to take the one simple screw holding it together out so I could put the piece back in, seems simple enough considering I fiddle with things all the time. Well, it just wouldn't go back together easily... like not at all. It was constructed poorly, couldn't get it back on without forcing it. I ended up not even bothering and just throwing it away the first day out of the package. From the other reviews I've read here, it sounds like I only saved myself further frustrations and don't regret my decision at all.Terrible product, don't buy. I'll never by anything with the name ""Zircon"" on it again."
1,Does not work,"I have tried using this over and over again. Probably 20 times. It has never worked right. I have compared this to my old entry level zircon which I did not like, and that one is at least correct 70% of the time. The most annoying thing about it, is that it starts this rapid error beep every time I start to move it after setting the reference."
1,Waste of money,"Bought unit from Home Depot but wanted everyone to know not to waste your money. The unit will not find a stud. The unit will sense a stud by just pressing the button and holding in 1 spot on the wall. NO MOVEMENT and it will tell you there is a stud. Tried in the garage where I can see the stud still the same results. I also tried testing the unit by moving closer to the stud and I would get different readings sometimes 2"" away from stud, sometimes 6"" away and sometimes it actually saw the stud. I tried on both normal and deep scan.Don't waste your money."
1,Horrendous,"Among the worst books I've read. Ever. Gaping plot holes. Leaden and nonsensical dialog. Characters that would have more dimension if they were cut from tracing paper.But at least the reader can indulge in an entertaining game of Find The Typos. Their all-too-numerous presence indicates that everyone involved in this..., from the author to the shipping clerks at the publishing house, deserve to be proscribed from so much as touching paper not to mention ink again.Frankly, I should have put the thing down after reading the dedication in which former dress designer and TV chef Cawley thanks two psychics and a street gypsy for encouraging him to write this so-called novel.You, however, still have the chance to walk away."
2,wrangler petite jeans,the design and quality of jeans were very good however the 10 petite size was unusually big and long. i had to return the item back. loved amazon's free no hassle-return on the item.
3,Wrangler Aura Jeans,"I have worn these jeans for years. When I saw this price, I grabbed three pair. One has a broken zipper. It did not seem worth it to return them. I guess two out of the three is ok."
3,Nice Jeans,"I don't usually like to buy pants online, but these were a gift for someone who ""couldn't find any jeans that fit."" She said these fit perfectly, so they must actually be a size 4, unlike a lot of clothes that label their sizing incorrectly. They seemed to be nicely made and the person who received them said she likes them a lot!"
1,Old Fashion,"La calidad y la terminacion de esta prenda es indiscutiblemente muy buena.. en el ajuste creo que tambien esta muy bien aunque antes de hacer el pedido lei las sugerencias y tome 2 medida menor a la que soy, (pedi un 6 y soy 8) aunque todo esto que he dicho es positivo doy mala puntacion por que la forma del jean no es ni parecido a la que se muestra aqui, es mas bien una forma de pantalon de hombre,es totalmente recto y cuadrado no me gusto la forma por eso no lo usare."
1,Retarded!!!,"They really should let us give movies zero stars, if there ever was a movie deserving o a zero rating it would be this craptacular movie. Was this suppose to be a parody or a sequel??? A good movie for horny teenage boys who want to see Boobs, boobs, and more boobs!!!"
3,An OK movie,"Before I purchased the Blu-ray disc, I did read reviews that the movie isn't too good. Sure enough, they were right. There is the typical nudity expected, but the plot is a bit weak. Would I recommend buying it, probably not, unless you like these somewhat lame types of movies."
1,Adequate,"I bought this to use on my new 3D tv --- the 3D effects were good. However, the story line leaves a lot to be desired. I would not recommend this movie it is a poor sequel to Piranha."
1,the quality of the feed was good but the sucked.,I would give the movie a no star . I WOULD NOT RENT THIS MOVIE unless boobs and stupidity is your cup of tea.
2,Disappointing,"i didn't expect this film to be better than Aja's Piranha, but this lackluster follow up should kill off the toothy fish for good. Setting the big final scene is a waterpark was a big mistake, as all people had to do was get out of the pool. Director Gulager didn't even try to do anything interesting with the moment, except to throw a bunch of body parts in the water. Uninspired on all counts, not even a good time waster on a rainy Saturday."
3,Do not take this movie seriously!,"You will have to know before you watch this movie that this movie is far from being serious. I actually watched this movie because the first one made me laugh more then cringe. I was amused but overall not as good as the first. If you are into just naked women with big you know whats you will get entertained. Thats why I was, but to expect an actual cool storyline then you will be let down."
4,Got exactly what I paid for,"I don't understand why so many people rank movies that are obviously made to be ""bad"" movies with 1's or 2's. Call a spade a spade. Look at the poster work on this movie. look at the title. THe fact that it has Christopher Lloyd in it is just brilliant. I purchased (and enjoyed) how stupid this movie was. Check out Piranha DD with another movie (similar poster):Roadside Massacre... Posters are very similar. Just like Piranha DD, Roadside Massacre is exactly what you expect it to be (and it was terrific too). I'm a huge fan of cult cinema, I'm always looking for that next amazing gem of a discovery."
1,Bad in all aspects..,"I regret paying 5 dollars on this movie...Does not worth it...Not good as action, horror or even porn movie."
3,plenty of action.,Plenty of action and good affects. Nice actresses. Very good plot and easy to follow. Good beginning andhad a good ending.
1,Useless,"An absolute waste of time, rather stupid. The pervious Piranha movie far better in comparison. Don't buy it. Save your money guys."
3,not as good as first one,I thought the first one was way better and for this type of b movie needs more tits!!!!! 3d is fun
3,Not as good as piranha 3d but still watchable,This was more of a comedy. i was actually dissapointed about how dumb it actually was.. even the piranha attack scenes were boring but somehow im still able to watch this movie
5,Great Cheesy Movie!,Rent this movie now! Don't take it seriously and you might enjoy it! Not quite as good as Piranha 2010.
2,I can see why it didn't get wide release,"You know going into a movie like this it won't be Oscar-caliber, but you at least expect a Hollywood production. This was barely that. Danielle Panabaker is smoking hot, and an enjoyable actress, but this film is 50,000ft beneath her! I loved the remake of Friday the 13th, so I figured this sequel would be up to her standards. Nope. It was terrible, and like so many Hollywood films these days, it could have been SO MUCH MORE!"
1,Stick with only the 1st movie; horrible sequel even at 15 bucks!!,"Most horrible 3d, bluray sequel I have purchased. Definitely not worth it even if it was free...Horrible in every aspect..."
3,"Fun, But no Oscars for this one","I just watched it on Blu-ray, in 2d, rented for $1.60 from redbox, much better than the $6.00 or $7.00 online streaming costs... Fun movie, lots of skin, defintely not enough gore, althou the last scene with the kid is fantastic, and the scene with the guy and girl and he gets a piranha surprise is to rediculous to be anything but fantastically funny, I wish it been in theatre's. Will I buy it next month on Blu Ray, maybe if it has a lower price than whats on here now, becuase its such a short movie, plus the blu has no extras, not even a trailer. And if I can get Blu Ray with out paying for a 3d version. I have whats called lazy eye, so 3d does not work for me at all. It got 3 stars because you can't do a two and a half stars."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I waited for this movie in June, then November and no word. I loved the first one, it has become one of my favorites. I was so looking forward to this one, granted I didn't expect anything to much like the original remake. This wasn't playing anywhere near me which made my cravings grow even stronger. I just saw this On Demand tonight and I, ummm...yeah so...it was a letdown. All the first film had, the humor, the amazing soundtrack and fantastically ferocious little fish are gone. I expected more from some of the actors, but they never got very far. This could have been a blast, but came up short. Close, but no severed finger. C-"
1,"PIRANHA 3DD ""BITES"" and Hits Rock Bottom...","JUST AWFUL! It's a grade Z movie, the 3D content is only marginal. and even the pretty girls can't save this one."
1,Piranha 3DD Blu-ray 3D,"The 3D disc would not play, error message: ""This Disc has recognized that your player and/or display does not support 3D Playback"". The Sony 3D player did an update that would not let the disc see if it was 3D. Working with Sony tech support we found if you change the 2D setting from auto to 1080P then the disc would play fine in 3D. No need to change the 3D setting, it can stay ""auto"". Each player has its own firmware update, hopefully most players can keep the default auto setting. I do not want the disc to check for a 3D player, just play the movie.Also the subtitles are not on the 3D disc, only the 2D disc has subtitles."
4,So much better than the first one,"Seriously, this one is way more fun without a lot of stupid filler like the first one. It's fun, it's tongue-in-cheek and it's a lot of 3-d mayhem. The first was bloated and just dumb with what seemed like an hour underwater sequence of boobs that was just dull. The star power was wasted. Here there is obviously less ""studio"" pressure to deliver one for the masses and rather, one for the fans of these types of movies. Thanks Gulager! A good follow-up to the Feast movies!"
1,Incompleta,"The 3D disco is w/out subtitular, a parte que la película es lo peor que he visto, es una comedia mala"
1,terrible,Don't even think about buying this. Quite ossibly one of the worst creations mankind has ever been able to make.
1,No Parody,"Parody requires intelligence and a reason for it's existence that enhances the original parodied source. Outside of boobs (for those few on Earth to not know them if they saw them) this movie was so bad (script, acting, filming, CGI) that it set a near personal record for fast forwarding so I could still retain important time for living e.g. digging a hole in the ground to immediately fill it back up."
1,Pathetic. Waste of my time and money.,"The first Piranha was a good movie... cheesey but entertaining. Piranha DD was a way for the producers, etc to show as many boobs as they could and attempt to make the movie both scary and sexy at the same time... in my opinion they failed! And what is with the children getting killed?! How tasteless and tacky do you have to be to put into a movie a little girl being run over by a golf cart and ending a movie with a young boy getting his head eaten off? Just like all the reality shows, Hollywood will do anything to make a buck."
2,"Terrible. I'd rate this a ""Instant stream"" or a ""torrent"". Dont waste a lot of money on it.","I knew going into it that it was a mindless gore movie, but with that in mind, this didn't deliver, or at least what it did was over the top ridiculous. The story was choppy, the gore minimal and pretty much consisted of the last 15 minutes. they totally ripped off Teeth at one part. All in all, a total bust compared to the first Piranha. The only thing that has any redeeming value are the hot girls, but even then it doesn't do much. NOT WORTH IT.Terrible. I'd rate this a ""Instant stream"" or a ""torrent"". Dont waste a lot of money on it."
2,Weak Sequel on all Counts,"What a disappointment. Actually, I didn't think Aja's Piranha held a candle to Joe Dante's original, anyway. However, it was at least a visceral, gory blast with lots of great eye candy. In this more-of-the-same sequel, there is less of everything. Less fun, less gore, less tongue-in-cheek comedy, less professionalism on the parts of the writer and director. What you get in this sequel is a bunch of pointless cameos, cartoonish direction, too-goofy comedy and less creative gore. Not to mention some less-than-inspired acting. It's no wonder this only got dumped into a handful of theaters before ending up on disc. However, if you're looking for mindless fun on the level of a SyFy channel movie (with a bigger budget), then you'll probably enjoy this undemanding junk. Not too bad for a beer-drinking time-killer. You be the judge."
3,Better than piranha 3d,"As one can see by looking at the balance of review numbers from 5-1 stars this film is pretty contradictory in nature. There are some great,surreal moments and some truly awful ones .The story is your basic bad ,greedy entrepreneur does something illegal that lets the monsters out.It has a lot of t and a in it and the usual flock of 20-somethings waiting to be slaughtered.Overall it's well done and a lot of fun with David Hasselhoff being very funny in his cameo.The bad guy isn't nearly as slimy as the one in the last film which is good because it made the movie less enjoyable."
3,Pro Plan Puppy,While I do not plan to continue using this dog food for my Jack Russell Terrier it was the food he was getting from the breeder i purchased the puppy from. I plan to more to a homemade formula when this supply is closer to runnning out.
4,Even After 50 Years,"I bought this book when I was a child and it became one of my favorite books--I'm now 60. I read it to my stepdaughter when she was a child--she's now 40 years old. I read it to my daughter when she was a child-she's 22 now. When the book got lost in the shuffle during my last move I thought it was lost forever. When I saw it at a local bookstore this year and in it's previous binding I knew I was going to buy it. I sent it to my stepdaughter to read to her two daughters-- 4 and 8 years old. The wit and underlying message in this book are ageless. Hopefully, this book will be passed on for another 50 years."
3,The 13 Dated Clocks,This is a good book do not get me wrong but the writing is dated and my 7 year old had a lot of questions during the book because of it. The lead character is referred to by at least 4 different names. This book reminds me of a favorite childhood movie that you rent as an adult and find it to be bleh. Times change. I would recommend this for an 8 - 9 year old that can read a chapter book on their own.
1,cynical & warped. NOT for children!,This is a terrible book for children. Way too dark with concepts that would be difficult for an adult to explain. I threw it out.
4,This fairy tale is not for kids,"The 13 Clocks is a wonderful and witty story, but on rereading it I realize that it contains so much physical violence that it hardly qualifies as a children's book. Very enjoyable, like most of Thurber's works, but you wouldn't read it to a six-year old."
5,Great Book,"This is a story that is so simple, yet incredibly complex. You don't quite now whats going on unless you think about it. It's a doorway to discover all kinds of interesting about yourself and life. This is just an all-around great book."
5,Thurber at his best.. read it!,"This has been one of my favourites ever since my sister gave it to me on my 11th birthday and introduced me to Thurber's delightful sideways view of the world. Like 'Rocky and Bullwinkle,' it's ostensibly intended for younger audiences but a joy full of gentle humour for adults as well.Rated 'G' for 'great fun!'"
4,WHAT A TREASURE !,"I chose Tower Treasure because my teacher recommended it because I told her I was interested in mystery books,and it was a good choice.This book is about two teenage boys who want to be detctives ,like their father.They are out to solve a mystery of stolen jewels.They want to solve it soon to clear their friends dad, who is suspected of the robbery.During there journey they find many clues.Will they solve it?Read it to find out the amazing ending.I would recommend"
4,The Tower Treasure,"The Tower Treasure is a great book for people who are interested in mystery. The book is about two boys, Frank and Joe, who start out on a mystery of their friend's stolen car. Once they find the stolen car, a new case awaits them, the case of the Tower Treasure! Them and their father fly to New York and search for clues on the robbery. The two boys fly back home to Bayport and see if their father can find some more clues. The book always haves you wanting to read the next chapter to see what happens. I can't teel you what happens, so you'll need to read it yourself!"
4,"Suspense, Mystery","This was a fairly good Hardy Boys book. Can't say it is the best though because other books have more suspense, mystery. However, this book was the first and therefore did not need to be the best. Frank and Joe Hardy are the sons of celebrated detective Fenton Hardy. Apparently even though it does not go into details, they just helped them on a case. They hear that the Tower Mansion, one of the bigges houses in town has been robbed. They find out that the suspected is one of their best friend's dad Henry Robinson. Using a lot of brainwork because of a deficit of details they figure out the solution of the mystery. To find out what it is, read it."
3,Alright for the first in the series,"This review concerns the revised 1959 edition. Frank and Joe try to prove to their father that they are good detectives by helping their friend, Chet Morton, find his stolen car and later by helping to clear another friend's father of robbery charges. This book is not the most thrilling mystery; however, that is understandable given that it was to be Frank and Joe's first case and considering that it wasn't that bad. Nonetheless, I would recommend reading the original version; the plot of both versions is identical and the events are mostly the same (some events where deleted in the revised edition and others slightly changed), but the revised edition has been drained of all of the rich language and strong characterization found in the original. The revised edition is still a good book, but if you have the option, I suggest reading the original because you will probably enjoy it more."
4,a good book that you should read,"in this book you will find a stolen car, a treature worth a lot of money and a friend in danger. if you like mysterys like i do than the tower treasure is the book for you. trust me you should get this book!!!!!!!"
4,No.1 Hardy Boys,"I loved this Book at first I didn't think I'd like the hardy boys, but I was wrong. This book got me started on a great series. Every night thats all I read. And I never Run out of books because there are a million. I'm trying to read all of them."
4,Good Book,"Hardy Boys #1 is a good book to me. I think you should read this book because it is action packed, full of suspense, and highly reccomended. that is why I vote it 4 stars."
3,The Hardy Boys and CONNORS review,The Hardy was the greatest mystery books of the Hardy boys series. This book is keeps you intrested all the way through. Now I am not going to tell you this book and what it is about. But there is a big surprise at the end of this book and what I am about to type is the rising action.Frank pukked out the flashlight and swung it around to where Joe was. The flashlight gave a good way for Joe to see.Joe called Frank over to him. They found a pile of boards and started to go through them. As they were going through them they found a bag. They were sure that was the tower treasure. As they started to go out of the building a man appear and shut the door on them and locked the door on them and graudually they were runinng out of air.That was the rising action and you will have to read the rest to find out what happens next.
2,Good,I liked but it needs more action my son read this book but he is more of a action kid so it is okay
2,Don't Read This Book,"I would never read another book by this author because the mystery is took hard to figure out by myself. I like mysteries that I can solve myself but this one was too difficult. Also, it was strange because the Hardy boys rode motorcycles and they are too young. The book was first written in 1927 and maybe things were different back then. But since this is the year 2002, some things in the book are too old-fashioned"
3,Encourage Kids To Grow Out Of The Formula Mystery,"The original Hardy Boys series is a set of formula mysteries written during a time when most authors and publishers did not take children's literature as seriously as they do today. Franklin W. Dixon is not a real author, but rather a name coined to disguise a slew of ghost writers hired by publishing mogul Edward Stratemeyer (1862-1930) and his syndicate.The Tower Treasure is a fine introduction to this series. The writer introduces amateur detectives Frank and Joe Hardy in a story that sets the tone for many other books.I and millions of others grew up on these books. They are passable entertainment for younger children, but kids who are interested in reading should be encouraged to pursue better writing."
3,A classic,"The first book in the Hardy Boys series, the book is a classic and a good introduction to the characters. With non stop adventure, it moves quickly and has several plot twists that one would expect from a goood mystery. Obviously, (first published in the early 1950's) the language is dated adding a quirky flavor to the book."
2,Copyright incorrect,The original Hardy Boys were written in the 1920's but the one I just purchased on the kindle was the re-written version from the 1950's and 1960's and not the original like the date said. Amazon please update this information on your pages so that no one else is misled
5,Amazing,This is the best book ever! This is amazing book. Oh yeah. It's true. I am not kidding. Oh yeah
5,Great books for any generation,I have a first edition of all the originals and drive a truck so Kindle copies are perfect. I love it.
3,"Good story, not the greatest publisher","If you've seen the film, you expect an even greater novel from which the great film of the same title is based. I didn't go for the ""cheesy cover"" with the movie actors' photos, nor did I appreciate the ""modern spin"" vis-a-vis the publisher's commentary on what is to me a great classic story. I think Warner Bros. improved on the story in their wonderful 1942 movie version. Also, when you watch the film, you don't have to put up with typos, which are not few in this printing!"
2,Somethin' for somebody not everybody,"Although they made an effort, this album was far from excellent. The tracks don't carry much quality. As a matter of fact nor do the titles. It's okay when you want to have some background music but not words to listen to."
3,C.O.C vote with a bullet single,"I BELIEVE BLIND IS THE MOST UNDER RATED ALBUM IN METAL HISTORY! WITH THAT SAID THIS SINGLE IS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. THE TITLE TRACK IS A RADIO EDIT AND I HATE THAT. CENSORED METAL, I CANT THINK OF A GREATER OXYMORON. THERE ARE 2 MORE TRACKS FROM BLIND 1 LIVE TRACK ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF LONG AND 1 FROM THE BLIND PEEL SESSIONS. ALL IN ALL ONLY FOR THE DIE HARD FANS, IF YOU CAN SUFFER THE RADIO EDIT."
5,Correction of two points.,"The country is Honduras. The plane arrives from the capital, Tegucigalpa.The ticket is a Paris Metro (subway) ticket for Place Pigalle station.A classic suspense masterpiece. Yves Montand's second film."
5,WAIT FOR BETTER RELEASE IN LATE 2005,"This film is excellent and surely worth 5 stars. However, the purpose of my review is to inform potential buyers to be a little patient before they consider buying this title.'Criterion Collection' provides excellent transfers of movies and have planned to re-release 'Wages of Fear' in LATE 2005, with a better picture transfer and more added extras. If you are a serious cinephile and movie appreciator, you should wait to purchase the 2nd print of this film. The current Criterion release is the best transfer available, and far surpasses the poor pan & scan release by 'Universal'.The current DVD transfer is above average, but the proposed new release by Criterion will promise to be excellent. Thus, unless you are an avid Criterion collector, I recommend you wait to purchase this excellent film until late 2005, as Criterion will fully honour the grandeur of 'Wages of Fear'."
2,Very over-rated with a weak ending.,"This film does create some great suspense,but the ending is so contrived and unbelievable that it spoils the whole film,in fact it is a very annoying ending.The film is also very slow and plodding in parts.Just because it's a foreign film doesn't mean it's a classic.A very over-rated film in my opinion."
3,"Warning! unneccesary cursing added to DVD subtitles, buy VHS","I wish that I could return this DVD edition and just purchase the VHS version that I originally saw. For some reason the editors added cursing to the subtitles and it really left a foul taste in my mouth. Why did they bother?!? it added nothing to the film and only detracts for those few of us left that still object to ""bad words"".The film itself is excellent..."
1,Low quality CD for a high quality price !,The CD is defected and caused stoppage three or four times through the viewing
5,Awsome movie!,"This film is a classic ranked highest in my list. To really apreciate this film, you must see the original version which is in french: ""Le salaire de la peur"". I have seen the 1977 remake and it is a pale copy of the french thriller.As for the american bashing, wake up and open your eyes. That's all they did in South America in the 20th century. Sending CIA and other agencies agents to train Death Squads in torture and killing to overthrow governments not giving rights to their natural resources and then leaving when nothing is left.I recommend this film to everyone and while you are at it, get ""Z"" from Costa Gravas for a little lesson in history.Buy and enjoy..."
5,Timeless Suspense Film,I first saw this film years ago on SBS Australia and since then it has stuck in my mind as one of the best films ever.This is no CG heavily produced run of the mill Hollywood films. It will grab you and get hold of you until the end. Wonderfully shot and edited and looks great on BD...a timeless film for all ages.
5,Epic Film now on Blu-Ray,"I only saw this movie for the first time a couple years ago. What a treat. The movie is a brutal depiction of greed run amok. The shifting relationships between the truckers are very interesting. In many ways, none of the characters are very likable, except maybe Luigi, yet you still are hanging on every movement to see if they make it to their destination.With a generous running time of 2:30, the main characters are given time to develop. The characters of Jo and Mario have an up-and-down friendship, as their flaws and strengths are tested. I also liked the director's occasional use of natives in the scenes, many times it seems to be a commentary on what ""civilized"" man has brought upon the world.The Blu-Ray presentation is excellent. The video quality is excellent with good black levels. The extras are all worth watching, especially the documentary on Clouzot and the interview with the assistant director. Overall, a typical superb effort by Criterion."
5,The Wages of Fear,"Very gripping, has a very good look at the transistion from the rubber barons of the last century to the oil barons of today...makes this a class ""A"" horror film!!!!"
4,"Are we having fun, yet ?","My favorite line in it: ""By the way, there are no shocks on these rigs. Our trucks don't have none of those modern conveniences.""After all, what's life but a ticket to the theatre in the Pigalle that you neither use or ever get to cash in? But you carry it with you, to hell, thru hell, and back."
5,Just as scary the second time!,A masterpiece of suspense filled with unforgettable characters. These character actors were real - seldom the case these days.Typical French ending!
5,Totally Chuffed!!!,"This is easily one of the top two or three metal albums of all time. This is the Reign In Blood of the Death Metal/Grind Core genre. Amazing lyrics, written with sheer honesty and brutality. As far as the music and songwriting goes, its furious and relentless. Pintado, Harris and Embury are songwriting gods. They combine speed, grind and crunch like no other. Support the mighty Naplam and buy this and then go see them live. If you get a chance to hang with them, I assure you, you won't be disappointed. The eternal Gods of Grind!!"
2,FA live on stage in the land of the rising sun is the `Kawasaki' album at 4x the price,"The 2-star rating here is not for the music, which is great, but for the high-priced rip-off package.`Kawasaki', recorded in the city of that name on 2nd July 1989 during Fairground Attraction's only tour of Japan remains the sole officially released recording of them playing on stage as a band, and features them performing many of the numbers intended for their never-completed second album.This `box set' import from Japan is the same disk with the same 16 tracks from the 2nd July Kawasaki concert - at four times the price. Why would anyone, even a diehard completist fan, buy it? There is no reason which makes sense: get the `Kawasaki' album instead."
3,Interesting...,"I bought this because--largely--I expected it to be over the top and psychotic. I was right. But it's also *surprisingly* good, although one gets the sense that there's certainly more interesting material out there that could've been tapped (this release comprises mostly Crown and Teichiku items, which is in itself limiting). What is included, however, it surprising both in its quality and wackiness; the bizarre cover of ""Fire"" is, well, strange, but it's also very good."
4,great music - and funny as hell,"Note: People with no sense of humor will probably not appreciate this CD. Yes, it is wacky. Yes, they are singing English phonetically and not making a whole lot of sense (at least, the ones in English are). But if you ever wanted to hear what an alternate universe where Paul McCartney and Sam & Dave were Japanese but still sang in English might sound like, buy this CD. It's a very weird spin on some classic 60's hits that makes you feel as if you've never heard these songs before. Also the bands are really good musically - tight and inventive. The two best bands on this particular comp. are The Burns (""I Saw Her Standing There"") and The Voltage (""Hold On, I'm Coming"") as far as I'm concerned."
5,I love this album!!!,"I wont say much in this review...but just listen to her version of ""É Luxo Só"" and you'll immediately fall in love with this artist's voice and style!This is a great album to get to know some of her best work!!! Don't hesitate!"
5,Truly informative and beneficial reading for anyone.,The book includes information from the very beginning of dance through many great ballets and into the present. There is an excellent videography at the end of the book as well as a glossary with all of the ballet terms.
2,Comprehensive dictionary,"Contains a description of all the terms asociated with the topic, but little more; if you want to know what it is all about, is OK; but if you have to solve a problem, is of very little use"
5,One of the great jazz albums,"This is on a par with the Phil Woods Live at the Showboat. In short, it's a jazz masterpiece. The quartet is at its peak. ""All Through The Night"" is simply incredible. Buy this if you can find copy."
3,Straight From the Horse's English Mouth,"Bizarre storyline, a young boy with a ""Sister"" complex...The finale of ""CountDown Akira"" is probably the most exciting of the three. All your questions are answered. The graphics and animation are quite abstract in contrast to other anime of it's genre. Remember this IS NOT an anime for people ""Under 18!"""
4,Bakes great but no thing of beauty,"So, I have these old steel and tinned square fruit cake tins (English Christmas cake). I needed one more this size to make three identical cakes. While the ""gray"" finish is nothing to behold, it worked beautifully. The cake was done at the same time as the two in the older pan with similar characteristics. I have been looking for 5"" square pan for a couple of years,. This fit the bill perfectly and cooked beautifully. I would recommend."
1,Wish it had been better,When I got this pan it was just packed with some brown paper...so not surprisingly it was bent ...I wouldn't order a pan this big again from online but I did order this brand in other sizes and they were very nice...these versus the Wilton ones I would def. Get these again...I did have to return this pan though..I got for 8 inch ones and just put them together for a 16 x16
5,Love these pans,I love using Fat Daddio's pans. They are high in quality and very durable. Cakes come out even and perfect.
5,Great Product,"I had never heard of this brand before and felt I was taking a risk by buying this pan. But, I love it. Great 9 x 9 pan for baking. Still looks as new as the day I bought it. I would recommend this brand."
2,Rounded corners,"I ordered the 12x12x2 square pans. I was disappointed to find that the corners were rounded off. I returned these immediately and purchased the Magic Line brand. They were a little more expensive, but I think the Magic Line are much better quality if you want to bake a nice, square cake."
1,Very Disappointed,"Never got the chance to use the pan. Description said dishwasher safe. I always clean new items in dishwasher B/4 first use. However, after the first wash, I removed it and was shocked to see that it looked like it had been in a fire. Blotches all over. I then washed it again by hand and when drying it, black came off on my drying towel and my finger when I rubbed it across the inside bottom. This concerned me as a health issue that the same black stuff would come off in food. I returned to Amazon who so graciously issued me a return label and immediate credit. I have been an Amazon customer for over a decade and they are real champions with excellent customer satisfaction.Needless to say, I will not be purchasing any of Fat Daddio's products and do not recommend them."
5,"Sturdy, durable and reliable!",This is one of the best molds you can get. Perfect for baking all sorts of goods! I bought it about a month ago and its performance has been great so far. You cannot go wrong with this brand.
3,Good and a half,"Orpheus was part of the Bostown sound in the late 1960s, a group of bands--also among them Beacon St. Union and Ultimate Spinishn. These were largely under the direction of a guy named Phil Lauber, and although it is to a degree prefab, it is still good music.Orpheus was soft rock, their most famous song being ""Never Find The Time To Tell you"" This set is a large sampling from all of their albums.The first album-hence the tracks from it--is the best: contained songs that have good arragnements, tateful orchestration and instruments like vibraphones. Almost like an art-soft-rock.Orpheus veered more towards soft rock each progressive album--curious that they did from 1968-69, as most rock was getting harder. This is not exactly easy listening, but does lack some punch.Not bad."
4,Bringing Back Memories of My Youth!,"The ""oldies"" station I listen to features a daily ""lost oldie"", one that you don't hear very often. One day they played a scratchy version of ""Can't Find The Time"", and it brought back great memories. Back in the spring of 1969 Orpheus performed at my Senior Prom. I owned their first two albums, and really liked them a lot. Unfortunately, most people never heard of Orpheus.Some of the material sounds dated but this set picks the cream of the crop, with heavy emphasis on the first two albums. It also includes a couple of rarities. I must admit that I found myself singing along just as I did thirty years ago.If you remember Orpheus, you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for some history of the ""Bosstown Sound"" this is a good place to start."
3,old folkies,"the BossTown Sound was a chance for old folkies still hanging around Cambridge to try and make some money.... ironically, the Orpheus song that FIRST received air play in Boston, Lesley's World, was left off this CD collection. Wonder why?"
5,Sturdy Ammo Box!,Very well made and sturdy. Perfect for what it's designed for and decorative enough that it can sit out to be enjoyed. Would definitely recommend!
4,A Qucik Read,This history of the Troubles is chocked full of people and places involved with the Northern Ireland Struggle. The volume of names shows the depth of research conducted by the author. Hope Against History gives a good basis to begin in dpeth reading on the various actors involved. This book clarifies the divisions in the military and political struggle.
3,The Troubles... for beginners.,"Holland deserves credit for writing a book that makes the Troubles accessible to readers who really don't know much about it, but I have to say, having read other books on the subject (Coogan, Bell, Moloney) and having followed events in NI for years, I found his analysis too often simplistic and facile, particularly as relates to the recent Peace Process. Read Ed Moloney's ""Secret History of the IRA"" and you'll know what I'm talking about."
2,Dated work. Not recommended.,This old book attempts to describe basic quantum chemistry and walk one through a series of exercises using the Gaussian series of programs. Not really very useful.
1,It's just an opinion,"...Music is very complicated and emotional. It is purely subjective. Each person must have a feel about what is good and likeable in their music. No two people are alike. We are all unique.For me, the music offered here did nothing to ignite a spark in me. I have tried on many occasions to make this music work for me, but have come up empty handed each time. I got no sense of any kind of emotioanl feeling from these performances. When you do not experience any kind of emotion from a song I would consider that performance a diaster.I guess this music is not my coup of tea. I am fortunate to have a large collection of jazz cds and am happy to say that I own some truely great performances by some great singers. All is not lost, there is always help right around the corner.I not going to make any recommendations about this cd."
4,A TRIBUTE DONE WITH GOOD TASTE,"Fine musical approach ,with musicians obviously enjoying themselves with the arrangments letting all of them shine with appropriate solos.Our singer sings her best, but i must admit that the tendancy to let the final notes go on forever gets annoying at times.I would not have been honest if i didn't mention this.It's hard to erase from our memory LOUIS ARMSTRONG's version of ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET,even with the added verse included here.Every other aspect of this cd is done with good taste ,and JIMMY McHUGH certainly deserve a tribute like this one.Now miss WHITFIELD,how about a tribute to WALTER DONALDSON or VINCENT YOUMANS?That would be nice."
2,Don't even think about buying this game.,"When I first got my Nintendo DS Lite in 2007, this was probably the 2nd game I got for it. I was so excited because at the time, Spongebob was my favorite show (And still is even at 12 almost 13). I start playing this game expecting it to be amazing, but I was extremely disappointed. The controls are TERRIBLE! The gameplay is bad, and all I need to say to anyone who reads this, Just don't buy it. It's a waste of money."
3,Nothing Exciting,I purchased this game for my 9 year old son for Christmas 2009. He said this game was not as exciting as he had hoped. He said you do not need to use a DS pen to navigate to play the game. You can use the arrow buttons.
5,A good book to keep in your home library!,"I think this book is a must-have. It is systematic and at the end of each section there is a conclusion, like a wrap-up. As much information as you can get on the internet there is nothing like having a book of this kind in your hands as a ready-reckoner. I use this book in my own home school; its a good book."
4,Enjoyable and thorough,"A very enjoyable and thorough book for those who need to use remoting in their development projects - if you want to know about remoting for VB.NET then this is the book for you. The book covers all the topics that you'll need to employ remoting. Synchronous and asynchronous remoting are covered as is a chapter explaining custom sinks and how to add them into the remoting process (something that I've yet to find explained in other books in as clear and concise a manner). Debugging and error handling is also covered, something that isn't given much space in the Microsoft documentation and this chapter will prove invaluable for any developers. Now if the publishers would only do a C# version of this book :-)."
2,If you know remoting and new to VB.Net,"I am new in area of remoting. So, when I bought this book I expect get ideas how to use remoting to solve my problems. The authors instead spend a lot on how to use streams, serializing and so on. Same ideas are repeated through the book - like use binary formatters to compress messages.If you know remoting but new to VB.Net this book is OK, otherwise ..."
4,Fitness walking that really works.,"The book is very complete and very easy to understand with step by step instructions that don't clog you mind or are hard to remember. Walking is presented as a healthy habit that will ensure a new way of working out and staying in shape. The book sets you up with valuable information from choosing the right gear to avoiding injuries to getting fit. It's a great book for beginners because it motivates you to start and keep fit without making it a routine or monotonous experience, helping you move to higher levels or workouts, while keeping the habit of walking. It makes a great addition to have along with Nutrition for Dummies and Workouts for Dummies.--Reviewed by M. E. Volmar"
2,Find something else,"I don't know what I expected, but there wasn't much there. I think that most everyone knows the stuff that's in there. Maybe motivation is what I was after and didn't get it."
4,She Does It Again,"Gloria Whelan is a master of dealing with runaways and orphans. This book is no exception.A brother and a sister must travel to Siberia to find their mother after she is sent to a work camp following her husbands arrest. Both children attempt to deal with their emotions as they try to make it hundreds of miles from their home.The real question is, do they make it?"
1,POOR QUALITY,THE BAGS ARE POOR QUALITY. WHEN RETURNED FOR CREDIT THE REFUND WAS ABOUT 1/2 OF WHAT I PAID FOR THE BAGS. IF I KNEW HOW MUCH REFUND I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN I WOULD HAVE DISCARDED THEM IN THE TRASH AND SAFE THE HASSLE OF RETURNING THEM.
1,worthless,"these rolls are thinner than saran wrap and stick to the burner not to mention on side of the ""bag"" was not sealed so I had to burn 3 sides just to make a bag!"
1,Avoid just throwing your money away,"I went to use these very, very thin bags hoping for some sort of strength when the side of the bag which was suppose to be sealed just came apart. If you want a very flimsy piece of plastic on a roll that holds nothing... then this is the way to go, otherwise it's not even worth the hassle to ship back."
1,terrible product,"I purchased these because they were recommended to be used with my deni food sealer. they are nothing but expensive saran wrap. do not waste your time with these. the food sealer works great, but it needs a textured bag. rival bags will work, food saver bags will work, go to ebay or sams and buy bags, but do not buy these."
1,Lightweight and un-usable,"I bought these for use with a Deni vacuum sealer. They are very low quality and thickness compared to what came with the machine. In addition, they are so flimsy, the vacuum will not take as the plastic layers close up. Also the non adjustable setting on seal time, melts the plastic to the heat strip. What a waste of money and time!"
3,Kind of thin,The bags are ok. I don't think they would be good for food saving. There a little on the thin side but should be good for other than food stuff.Paul
1,Really bad customer service !!,Don't ever do business with these people. I ordered a food vacuum sealer that was defective that I returned. I am now stuck with $28 worth of replacement bags which they refuse to refund me for. I ordered the sealer for a Christmas gift so the 30 day policy had expired by the time we discovered it was faulty. How was I supposed to know that it was defective until Christmas morning. Never again will I buy anything from them. I had no idea that replacement bags had expiration dates!!
1,These suck,"OK, where do I start? First, these are not really made for vacuum sealing, in my view; they are thin, and not strong criss-crossed [on back] like others I have used. Also, to my amazement, they are not 'tubes', meaning they require three [3] sealings for EACH bag you do--yeah, three! Can't recommend...update:12/2012Note that I was using a Foodsaver brand sealer--may work great for a Deni, but still--not a flattened tube of plastic as i anticipated (see above)"
1,Plastic bag material too thin.,The Deni 1640 Freshlock replacement roll material is too light to push the sensor in the Food Saver that activates it.
3,Vacuum Sealer Rolls,"I purchased these rolls as a substitute as they were less than half the cost of rolls for my sealer (different brand + my original ones had been back ordered). That was a mistake. My sealer would seal them with no problem, however they would not vacuum."
1,wothless,"I recently bought five rolls of the Deni 1640 11in X 33ft vacuum bags. I'm not sure what kind of machine you are supposed to use these in, if any. First, I tried the full cycle seal selection, it completely melted the bag. I then tried to seal it for 2 seconds, it still melted. I totaly threw away $59.90. It looks as the price was to good to be true."
1,food saver refill,This plastic was TOO thin to seal. When I called the company they said I couldn't get a refund because the package was opened/used....DUH....how would a person know it was basically defective...I threw it away
1,Too thin for most machines,The Deni vacuum rolls description said would work in most machines. The rolls are very thin plastic and if your machine does not have a low heat switch it will burn the plastic and it will not seal. Amazon let me send the product back and credited my account. I bought vacuum rolls at SAMS for the same price and they are fantastic.
1,Just use Saran wrap.,These are not bags. They are rolls of folded plastic that have to be sealed on three sides. The Deni Vacuum Sealer designed to use these rolls has a hose that slips inside the bag and does a poor job of removing the air. Don't even consider these for your Foodsaver.
1,ripped off,This product is marketed as vacuum sealer rolls but they won't work in Foodsaver sealers so I had to return them. This fact should be explicitly stated in their marketing.
1,JUNK!,"I wasn't allowed to give this product 0 stars, so I grudgingly gave it 1. I can say without a doubt that this is the cheesiest, most low quality junk I've ever purchased. I thought I was getting an excellent deal with 3 rolls for under $10, but you get what you pay for. This product will NOT WORK with a Foodsaver vac/sealer. I've purchased other ""generic"" type brands and they worked fine. As for the comments that the rolls work with the machine they were intended for, why would you want such a low quality product with any machine? You can tear the plastic with your fingers, it's as flimsy as any plastic wrap. Never been so disappointed. I see that you can't return the rolls once you've opened them, so I hope the meats and cheeses I managed to wrap (using scotch tape!) don't get freezer burn, as it didn't vacuum at all or seal very well."
1,Deni 1640 Freshlock bags,"The bags were a great price, but after receiving them, one side of the bags were not sealed. I had to cut bags, seal the side, then tried to vacuum out the air and seal the bag. The bags would not work. When trying to vacuum out the air, nothing happened. I could seal the bags, but could not remove the air. I tried using 2 vacuuming machines to remove the air. No luck! Don't waste your money on these bags unless you just want to seal something and not remove the air. Poorly constructed and no quality assurance with these bags. Save your money and don't purchase..."
1,Yep that's it.,"Just a quick note. ""I never heard"" is the original version of the NEW Michael Jackson song ""This is it"""
4,Safire's a Winner!,"Safire shows much vocal maturity on her 2nd album. This is a very good album despite the previous review. Her vocals are tight, the beats are slammin! wonderful second effort!!!"
5,"Awsome Music, Awsome Cover Art, Awsome Girl!","I LOVE everything about SAFIRE! From her debut to our recent phone conversation. This girl is pure and very real. Unlike other freestyle artists, Safire is NOT a fake. The way we communicate took my love for her to another level. Pure Respect!"
5,a really tight freestyle album,this album is off the hook im a big fan of safire since thinking of you to can u stand the rain if u are a big fan of freestyle music like myself yall check my girl safire out peace
3,Vibrant but kind of cheap,"This flag is actually thinner than any other flag I have ever purchased. It is very cute, but it is not the most quality flag I have ever purchased, in fact, mine even came with snags in it. Besides the quality, the colors are very vibrant and I like everything about it except the dumb font. I wish it were a little more ""mature"" looking, after all the kind of people likely to order this flag are people that have dogs over kids and this flag is made to look like a kid made it."
1,Customer unsatisfaction,"Ordered by mistake two items of the same kind. Called three times to have one item returned to my account. No response from company and no phone call or e-mail message. Very frustrating"""
2,HEY KANDI..WHAT IS WRONG WITH U???,Kandi...kandi...kandi...u have very good vocall ksills and have writeen great songs for other artists...AND U GAVE THEM YOR BEST SONGS LEAVING THE ONES THAT SUCK FOR YOURSELF..I listen to the album every now and then becaus eits good but you could have done WAY WAY better than that.....UH OH....Guess who is coming out..your rival..LATOCHA SCOTT is releaseing her solo album in 2004..i bet this will make u jump up and write some actal good songs..advice..if u decide to come back out AND I HOPE U DO...LEAVE THE DAMN NURSERY RHYME SONGS ALONE...write some songs with some real emotions and depth.......Write from your HEART AND NOT YOUR HEAD..if you need some help EMAIL ME I WILL HELP
4,Hey Kandi,Hi im a diehard fan for XSCAPE and when I heard Kandi was having her own album I went krazy.I out off buying it for others like Amil and Trina but I regret that.The best song in the world is on hear it's Easier w/Faith Evans.It talks about her struggles with her brother dying and FAith's struggles with loosing B.I.G.It is a beautiful song an it's worth the 15 dollars alone. Other cool tracks are Dont think I'm not and Talkin bout me Buy this c.d and you'll love it.
4,Catchy,"I was interested in this album, because I knew she was from Xscape, and I loved the work she did with TLC, Destiny's Child, Mariah Carey and more.Overall this cd is fun, its catchy and upbeat. Its good but it isnt great, but if you like R&B you would like this. Definately worth a listen."
5,Excellent,"i love this CD, it is so great. the first time i ever heard i fell in love with and knew i had to get it again. i think kandi is a great writer and excellent singer and she did her thang on this album. you go girl!!"
3,"It's OK, but....","I loved XScape...I loved Bills, Bills, Bills, Bug-A-Boo, ...., but this album isn't it... I mean Kandi can sing....., not doubt about that, I just felt that as great voice and as good (and successful) a songwriter as she deserves an album worthy of her level of talent. She's toooo good for her material, just like Toni Braxton."
2,Stick To Writing,"I thought that I would enjoy this album because I love Xscape. Unfortunately, I was disgusted by this ablum. Kandi can sing, no doubt. SHe wrote great songs for Pop artists and Teen R&B artists. However,she seems to have forgotten her audience when it came to her album. There is not one song on this album that would make ou think of Xscape. SHe is like these other trashy singers and that's a shame. MAybe she should stick to writing for other people."
3,There You Go Kandi,"I thought that this CD would be better than it actually is taken the fact that Kandi has written and helped produce many hits such as NO SCRUBS and THERE YOU GO. Now, don't get me wrong the cd is not bad but it could've been better. THe uptempo songs sound like a lot of on the surface R&B that many other singers sing and Kandi really does not have a distincitve voice. I mainly got the CD b/c I saw her in concert at the B96 Halloween Bash in 2000. SOngs like HEY KANDI, CHEATIN ON ME, WHAT I'M GON DO, DON'T THINK IM NOT and the ballad dedicated to her deceased brother-EASIER with a duet from soul singer Faith Evans are the standout cuts on the CD. The other songs serve mainly as filler but is a decent disc overall."
1,I wont bite my tounge!,"Being a big fan of Xscape, I thought that I would enjoy the solo album of Kandi, but unfortunately, I was more than a bit disappointed. I'll give the woman some credit, she can sing, but her lyrics are wack. I couldn't tell from one minute to the next if she was a man hater or not. Maybe if I was 16 I would better appreciate the album, but as it is, I'm not 16 and I was a bit disgusted and mad that I spent good money on this cd. I only hope that with her next cd her lyrics will become more substantial and not so bubble-gummy."
2,So id not like this CD,This CD was just not good...its that CD that just sits in your home and never gets play. Maybe even selling it amazon. try again.
3,a little below average,"Hey Kandi... would have been more impressive and fresh if she hadn't given her style away to the likes of TLC and Destiny's Child two years before its release. Some tracks stand out, but most sound the same,"
2,"Oh, kandi...",this album was not good at all. there were only two tracks that I can actually listen to; don't think I'm not and I wanna know. I heard the group is supposed to be getting back together. I hope so because they make good music together. 2 stars for the 2 tracks of the cd I paid almost $20 for.
2,KANDI,UMM THIS CD WAS OK. IT WASN'T NOTHING 2 MAKE A BIG DEAL OVER. ON A SCALE ON 1-10 WITH 10 BEING THE HIGHEST....I RATED THE SONG ON THIS ALBUM LIKE THISINTRO 1/10HEY KANDI 1/10CHEATIN' ON ME 9/10WHAT I'M GON DO TO YOU 2/10DON'T THINK I'M NOT 9/10PANTS ON FIRE 5/10CAN'T COME BACK 8/10I WANNA KNOW 7/10TALKING BOUT ME 5/10SUCKA FOR YOU 7/10I WON'T BITE MY TONGUE 9/10( TRUTHFUL SONG)JUST SO YOU KNOW 5/10EASIER 10/10 ( I LOVE THIS SONG)OUTRO 1/10I REALLY THINK THIS CD COULD HAVE BETTER ALOT BETTER!
5,Excellent book,This book was amazing on so many levels. Thank you very much. Strongly recommend. Especially if you are seeking motivation.
5,A Business Book w/ Immediate Personal Application,"I tend to lean towards non-fiction books with some serious meat (crammed with facts, figures, and about as exciting to read as the index of an engineering text) to them, but at the recommendation of a friend, I purchased Jim Clemmer's Growing the Distance. I was very pleasantly surprised. It is a very easy and enjoyable read, yet is full of great advice about being a better employee/employer/leader and all-around person. If you tend to get stuck in pessimistic ruts, this is a great book to keep around for an encouraging chapter read as needed."
4,COLLECTION PEICE,THIS IS A GREAT PEICE TO ADD TO ANY DALE EARNHARDT JR. COLLECTION. I CAN'T SAY HOW DURABLE IT IS BECAUSE IT'S NEVER BEEN OUT OF THE BOX.
4,Almost Perfect!,This light is almost perfect! We love that it stays on without having to hold on to the switch like on other highpowered spotlights. We love that it is dual mode as well. The only thing that we're less than happy with is the charging time required. I think it is something like 18 hours just to charge it up. That's alot of time!
2,The worst of the Dear Americas,"This book was not a very good installment ot the Dear America series. First of all, there is no way to keep track of the date. This is somehow very important to me, don't ask me why. I just like accuracy. Second, the book was so confusing, I didn't know what was going on at the end. And third, how on earth did she end up with an English name? Her sister's name is Kaibah. Where did 'Sarah' come from. All inall, if you like the Dear America series, I suggest you read either A Coal Miner's Bride or Love Thy Neighbor or especially A Line in the Sand."
1,"Good, But Not Dynamite",This book was not entirely that good. The writer (who is Anglo)wrote this book with the historical facts all wrong. The main character Sara Nita has an English name and the Navajo's didn't get English name until they were forced to the American schools. It is good to have someone write about the Navajo's but they should get their facts correct. The Americans were too nice in this book. I am Navajo and from what my Elders tell me they were cruel to my people.
3,Not so good,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I had heard it was really great and it sounded like it wa really well told, if a little complex. But still, when I got it, I found the first part awful. It was just boring. I guess it just wasn't like the other books I'd read in the series. It was more indian than american. It got better once there was some excitment, after Sarah Nita's family was taken by the soldiers, but It still had an element of boredem in it. I really wouldn't reccomend buying it, but if u can get it off a friend to borrow, i guess it's worth reading."
2,Copy protection turns good music cd into coaster,"I have listened to samples of the songs on the CD and know the work of BadBoyJoe and so I assume that the music on this disc would be worth 4 or 5 stars. However, they have put some evil copy protection voodoo on this cd and I cannot play it on a personal computer. Additionally, when I explore the disc, I find that it contains A)an executable program B) one very large WMV file and C) one small (6kb) file for each of the tracks on the album. This does not appear to contain normal audio CD format tracks and I worry that I will not be able to play it on my cd player at home. Ughh!"
4,Enron and beyond,The future of corporate reporting was a good read for someone with no background in accounting and auditing. It painted the after-Enron picture very clearly and described the necessary next steps to move the profession forward and rebuild public trust. As a former business reporter I found it very insightful to learn from the auditors' perspective how the different players impact the game.
2,Don't Drop It or Use It as a Keychain,"The Good:It has a mirror and a flashlight. I particularly like the flashlight.It has handy gadgets such as tweezers (splinters), compartments (for Advil), and scissors.The Bad:It is fragile! I used the Miss Army Kit as a key chain and dropped it. The mirror popped off. It was a 2-foot-drop not the Sears tower!My car key (the only key I used for the kit) broke off the ring all the time.The pen slipped out of the compartment and gone forever. The company doesn't offer replacement tools.Conclusion:Cute idea, but you are better off buying a Swiss Army Knife (which I did). No mirror though."
2,Great Idea but not sturdy enough,"I'm backpacking the europe for several months so need something just like Miss Army Kit. The minute I saw it I knew I had to have it. I love all the details and think it is one of the greatest invention for women travelers. However, the plastic part where the mirror and the pillbox were already fell apart after a week. My recommnedation is that DO NOT USE THIS AS A KEYCHAIN, IT WILL BREAK. Otherwise, cute and smart kit to have. oh, one more thing, the perfume bottle doesn't really hold any perfume."
2,Elevator Music,"Unusual offering from Irakere, but that in itself is not unusual. They're either great or off. This CD is in the off category."
5,Napalm Death's greatest,"I remember having this on audio tape back in the days. It still holds up to this day as one of grindcore's greatest albums by Napalm Death. It's a constant roller coaster of fast drums, guitar riffs and Barney's amazing voice. I can't say which track I like best. They are all fast and crazy. Highly recommended!"
3,Not optimum for alto saxophone,"I have issues with the plastic hook, which is not designed for quick release. Also, after adjusting the strap in order to position it for use with an alto saxophone, it holds the horn much too close to my body to feel totally comfortable."
1,too big for child,"I purchased this for my child, but it was way too big. My child is in the 6th grade. don't waste your money.My child is the average weight and height of a 12 year old."
3,does relieve neck strain but an odd fit for women,"Nice idea and it does feel better than using a neck strap. However, it is pretty awkward as a woman (and I am not even busty woman, either!). I will use this for practice at home, but will stick with my neck strap in public!!"
5,Excellent product,"This harness is much better, its puts all the weight of my sax on my shoulders, the other harness (Super harness) hurts my neck. I give this product my highest rating."
4,She loves it.. I HATE it!,"Its a decent book.. my 1 yr old daughter loves it, but it drive me insane! You can only hear ""Yellow makes me feel HAP HAP HAPPY"" so many times before you wanna throw it out the window! :) The songs are nice but the voices are irritating."
4,Nice book,"My daughter, 12 months, loves to flip through books. This one is great because she cannot rip it apart and it has little buttons to push. The only thing I do not like about it is that the voice is a little creepy. My daughter doesn't seem to mind though; she loves playing with it."
2,A disappointment when compaired to her previous books.,I really looked forward to reading this book since I had read 3 other books by the author and loved them. I think she is better able to write from an adult viewpoint versus an adolescent.
2,Readable but forgettable,"The characters were quite 1-dimensional, I didn't get involved with them and to be honest I didn't really care when Katie's heart was broken. Perhaps the story has been over-done, but I found nothing new and challenging in this book. I haven't read the first book and I don't think I am going to. It is not offensive but not powerful either."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I absolutely love Elizabeth Berg and started to fall in love when I first read her novel ""Open House"". I was soooo excited to finally read ""joy school"". Well, it did not add up to Berg's other books at all, and I was very disappointed. Since I am in my early 20s, I found the character Katie to be nothing like a 13 year old. Her character was very unbelieveable. I constantly felt like I was rolling my eyes at Katie while I was reading. In Berg's other books, the characters are dynamic and interesting and believeable. This book was not all I hoped!"
3,Joy School,"I was able to read this book in one day (this is with two small children to keep up with). It was an interesting story about a young girl trying to figure life out. The storyline is minimal and it all from her perspective. Interesting book but not fabulous, more like three and a half stars."
4,Another great read,"This is the fourth Elizabeth Berg book I've read, and it has cemented my admiration for this writer. ""Joy School"" is actually a follow-up to ""Durable Goods"", but I wasn't aware of this when I commenced this book. You don't need to have read the first book to enjoy this one. Ms Berg has a real gift for creating wonderfully three-dimensional characters. In this case she's writing in the first person as a teenage girl (often a curly one for some writers) and she pulls it off beautifully. There are funny moments, sad moments, and moments so poignant you feel as though you're the main character yourself. I've just started another of Elizabeth Berg's books, ""Range of Motion"" and so far, so good. I'll certainly keep buying books by this author - long may she write!"
5,"Bittersweet, yet extremely funny","Elizabeth Berg's writing style is one that describes characters, and feelings down to a T. This book reminded me of my own sometimes times painful adolescence and the main chararacter utters many a word that I have said as well. It is at times painfully sad, yet there is an enormous amount of humor, most of which rings so close to home, it's even funnier! Reading one of Elizabeth's books feels like 'dishing' with an old pal - nothing is held back, no secrets kept. I loved this book and recommend it highly."
3,"Enjoyable, but not earth shattering","I chose this rating because the I found the main character, Katie, unbelievable and far too advanced in conceptual thinking for a young girl. Elizabeth Berg is one of my favorite authors, but this book paled in comparison to ""We are All Welcome Here,"" and ""Ordinary Life."""
4,A sweet tale,It was a sweet story told by the author-a kind of coming of age for a 12 something-something we could identify with.
5,"Joy School, a joyous read!","A wonderful book I think 10's should be saved for only very special books and this is one. You learn much about where joy comes from. I read it in the best possible way immediately after finishing ""Durable Goods"" Berg's earlier novel which first introduced the characters in ""Joy School"""
5,JOY SCHOOL>>>> A JOY IT IS,"This book is soooo good. I am 13 too and can relate to Katie so much while reading. You have to read it.... it is worth it. As said in another review,,, you will definately miss Katie as soon as your finished this book... I LOVED IT AND IF ANYONE HERE KNOWS WHERE TO WRITE TOO THE AUTHOR... ELIZABETH BERG... THEN PLEASE E-MAIL ME (EROSEN4199@AOL.COM)"
4,Growing up the life Katie does isn't easy.,"Katie is back and this time she is in Missouri with her dad. This time she having a tough time adjusting to being in a new place and meeting people.Katie first starts a friendship with Cynthia. Cynthia lives with my family and her mother is nut case. Always telling the girls how things should be done and how she does them. While hanging out with Cynthia, Katie meets Cynthia's grandmother Nona who is an old italian lady who takes to Katie right away.Katie always falls in love with the guy at the gas station. Jimmy is who Katie is really in love with and would do anything to be with him, but he isn't intersted in Katie in the way that Katie would like him to be.Katie always starts a friendship with a troubled girl named Taylor who is smart but doesn't always do the best things.From the way Berg pulls together this book from the way the charactors all interacte and how her father has grown up some. Makes this a book that isn't easy to forget."
3,Great Book For Female Teens,"Joy School would be a great book to read, if you are a female teen. Elizabeth Berg wrote this book mainly for female teenagers attending high school. The recommendation of this book would be more towards females than males because Berg describes everything in detail and most female teenagers can easily relate to some events that take place in this book. I would have to honestly say the only reason that I wasn't totally into this book was beacuse Berg was telling a story about a girl and her troubles with the crush of her life and her friends. Other than that I would have to say that this book would lure female teens because it would make them engage into what is going on in the book."
3,"Good read, wasn't what I expected","After reading the synopsis of the book, I wanted to read it right away. When I was done, I said to myself, ""that was it? "" Yup, that was it. Berg did a wonderful job of expressing an adolescent's true feelings, but a lot of the actions and expressions felt didn't feel ""complete."" I felt that there was something missing from the novel...Berg wonderfully interpreted a young woman's feelings on love, but like one other person said, ""It was good, but not one of her best.&quot"
3,Joy School gets a C,"This follow up to ""Durable Goods"" was underdeveloped. Why was the father abusive? What's up with Katie's runaway sister? There are many angles to Katie which could be further chronicled. It's a good surface read but so much is yet to be uncovered."
2,Meh.,"This book was okay. There were parts I certainly enjoyed, but after I finished the book, I thought, ""That's it?"""
5,Memorable,"Elizabeth Berg has perfectly captured the feeling of being an adolescent girl in this sweet novel. We all know Cherylanne; the best friend who is both exasperatingly concieted and loveable. We have all had Ms. Sweet; the humourously agressive gym teacher.This novel made me laugh out loud more than once. Nearly every page has one of Katie's memorable wryly-worded observations on life. Whether she is commenting on an annoying teacher, her new ""boyfriend"" or her physically abusive father, the voice of Katie is illuminating and unforgetable. Reading this book is a purely enjoyable experience."
4,"Not the Old Young Fugs, But Still a Nice Selection...","Have to admit I'm still waiting on release of ""Golden Filth"" on CD. Meanwhile, though, this album is a very nice Fugs interpretation of the times they found in the mid-80s. Guess maybe I'll have to fire up the computer and digitize the old vinyl myself... Haven't listened to the ""Greatest Hits"" CD yet, but looking at the playlist, I'm wondering how they passed on CCD and so many other great tunes in favor of selections from this more recent collection..."
3,Glad you're happy in Spain but not the same J.R.,"Time was when no one could match Josh Rouse for peppy pop hooks and music that just darn-it made me smile. 1972 or Nashville was always guaranteed to cheer me up when I was down. Starting with Subtitulo he seems to be connecting more with the Establishment. The latest effort sounds pretty much like the house band in a cocktail lounge, or Mantovani - horns, strings and something called a mellotron. JR seems to be going more for a cool-jazz vibe. He has apparently grown up and left the fun music behind. I did enjoy Hollywood Bass Player a lot, but the rest of it is forgettable, music to have in the background at your bridge party."
1,Buy for $39 on publishers website,You can order this book for much less on the Wiley website. Don't pay the absurd markup here. It is only $39 list price
2,Thirteenth Floor Elevators - 'Live' (Collectables),"There's one OTHER 13th Floor 'live' reissue I've heard that is worse that this one.'Live' is actually somewhat tolerable, that is IF you're an open-minded music fan. From the sound of it, I'm about 98% sure that 'Live' is a fake live recording. Either that OR their sound man is three-quarters deaf. Now, if you would like to check out some really great sounding all American psychedelia, get yourself a copy of the three 'actual / legit' Elevator's reissues, on the Collectables label. Which are 'Psychedelic Sounds Of The...' ('66), 'Easter Everywhere' ('67) and 'Bull Of The Woods' ('68). Keep in mind that ALL their other releases are either live, re-edits or cheesy compilations."
2,not the best sampler,"The first two albums (The Psychedelic Sounds of.. and Easter Everywhere) are by far the best. If you don't yet know this music and want to pick one album to sample, try Easter Everywhere."
5,Super Product,"I almost went with the competing 'iKlear' product but after reading reviews here, I decided on this product and I have not been disappointed. Works well on my MBP screen and cheaper IBM work laptop. Great value getting two bottles of this for the price."
5,Absolutely great!!,"Streakless, worked very well on my high-def, ""shiny"" HP notebook screen. No bad chemicals, no streaks, could not be easier."
5,Works great with matte screen.,"I used this on my laptop's 15.4"" matte screen. A couple of sprays and a wipe down with the microfiber cloth provided and the screen looks like new. No problems with streaks, either. Two bottles is enough to last me for a good few years."
5,Leaves my laptop screen sparkling!,This is an effective screen cleaner. The fact that it comes with 2 bottles and a microfiber cloth makes it a terrific value!
5,Works well on laptops and phones,"I use this to clean my laptop and cell phone displays. The two bottles give you enough fluid to last quite a while, and the included cleaning cloth feels very durable and high quality."
3,"Good, but overpriced","This product works well but seems overpriced. Monster iClean+ seems to function identically toCleanDr LCD/Plasma Screen Cleaner, but the CleanDr product includes 8oz of cleaning fluid (versus Monster's two 1.52oz bottles), a larger micro-fiber cloth, and costs less to boot! iClean+'s small cleaning cloth is fine for laptop displays and desktop LCD monitors, but becomes a liability if you want to clean a large LCD TV like I did. Granted, this product is designed as a ""travel size"" kit and it works much better for that use than the bulky 8oz CleanDr cleaner. Both products require a bit of effort if you want to achieve a streak-free cleaning, but (eventually) lead to a sparkling streak-free display."
2,Streakmania,"I used this product across multiple monitors based on reviews here, I got to say I am not impressed at all. My monitor is streaked well beyond what it was before I used it."
2,TOO MANY SMUDGES,Used to use this on my Apple iMac but it left the screen covered in smudges. Switched to Philips LCD cleaner which leaves the glass completely clear.
5,This 'Look To The Rainbow' is songstress Anita Ellis'...,"...recording from South Carolina in 1977. Anita is an immensely gifted singer of the American Popular Song. The selections here are given luscious, soulful renderings so exquisitely full-bodied; I've appointed an intermission to this CD, allowing the joy of its distinct revelations time for savoring. There are selections from Broadway musicals, film and among others a gem named 'Poor Loulie Jean' with glorious nuance. You discover the rest. Previous recordings of Ellis' such as 'A Legend Sings With Ellis Larkins At The Piano' and 'Echoes' recorded with actor/singer/brother Larry Kert deserve a CD release. And there are others...."
1,Disappointed,"I feel I missed something in addition to fifty dollars. I am a new swimmer with fears of the deep end. While the instructor's guidance on staying in your body is good and well taken, the rest of the video does nothing for someone who needs to overcome a fear of deep water. Had I been aware of the lack of content in this product I never would have spent the money. When it was over I could not believe it! I literally just stared at my computer screen in disbelief. What a pity. Wish I had my $$$ back. Oh well."
5,Have found comfort in water.,"I bought Melon's video and felt that she had found the missing thing that swimming instructors aren't able to provide, and that is that we need to stay in the present, and not think about the skill we are learning. Usually, if we are thinking about anything it is how terrified we are of the water, and how out of control we feel in it. Melon's theory is to stay present and feel how the water is affecting our bodies in it. Our staying present, relaxes us and we can then find that we will learn how to be in control of ourselves in it. This is how we overcome our fears of water."
3,Good As a Quick Reference,"This is a rather readable book which you can finish within an hour or so. In style it is terse and it is well rounded: the very hallmark of a good advocate. Basically, this book stresses the use of one's imagination in every way to make your investment a success. It essentially touches and concerns the big deals. There are for sure a number of good and practical investing tips: very good as a quick reference. The most brilliant part of the book, however, is the chapter on negotiation which is well covered and could practically be used in almost all kinds of negotiations."
4,Good lessons,I like the way the book was laid out. You learn it from an experienced real estate attorney and investor. Looking forward to another by George!
2,"Too Bad the ""Trump Touch"" doesnt apply to any books","George Ross may be an excellent lawyer and for sure an acclaimed brown noser. Heck, he is probably great at real estate but everything in this book is common sense. I admit, the info about air rights in New York city was some interesting info, but there is practically NOTHING in here for the small investor. Just case study about how great Trump is and how he implemented his MIllion and Billion dollar real estate deals. Gimme a break, thats like comparing filet mignon and beef jerky.I sold this book back on amazon.com to try and recoupe my investment in this book. I have a loss of 4 bux. But at least it wont be collecting dust on MY bookshelf."
3,Expected a little more useful information,"After reading this book I ended up a little disapointed. Its a good book but I think the strategies George talks about are more ideal to the big time investor like Donald and not the small investor like the title implies. It is an entertaining book and a quick read. It does give good insight on negociation but not so much on real estate investing. If your looking for a real estate book, this is definitely not it."
1,Book is for the large investor. Pretty irrelevant for the rest of us,"Again, if you want to read about how great the Donald is, buy this book. IF you are interested in buying and selling or investing in rental properties, save your money. How many times is he going to write the ""Art of the Deal""?"
3,Barely OK,"I hoped for something much better than what I received. Generally, the book is written by a lawyer who assisted in big real estate deals and seems to have little experience in advising small investors. There are much better books to be read on the subject."
4,Very Interesting,"According to the book, George Ross was very instrumental in Donald Trump's success and more power to him. His book is very entertaining and informative. Having seen him numerous times on the Apprentice it is easy to see his personality come through in his writing. I recommend the book to anyone who wants an enjoyable, enlightening and full-of-ideas read."
1,WTF?,These anti-pullover pump discharge nozzles have cork gaskets. However Holley part #1008-844 pak of 10 gaskets are not cork according to Holley. They are black composite gaskets with alum. sandwiched in between.
5,Wonderful Addition to Library,"Cicely Mary Barker and all of her books are a delightful addition to our library! The poems are beautiful, inviting and educational. The art is magical. It brings you into the piece. I find myself lingering on each page to study each fairy and flower in great detail. My 4 year old loves to hear me read the poems and she enjoys looking at the pictures. She has the coloring book."
3,Nancy's Review,The songs of the fairies is wonderful. It's classic children's literature. The poems have a delicate charm. The artwork is beautiful.
2,Broad but not helpful,"The guide book gave a broad brush overview of the Lake Tahoe area. But it didn't cover any area well enough to be very useful on our vacation. It would have been fine for a tourist who might never have been to Tahoe, but it didn't help us find the true jewels of the area. We did better driving around, reading brochures and the paper."
2,sloppy research mars this book,"I have only glanced quickly at this book, but I found significant errors in several of the trips outlined. Dates of open facilities, significant historic details, etc., are just plain incorrect. Since I am involved in the outdoor recreation business in this area, and the errors I found directly relate to locations I manage or are responsible for, I'm concerned that the authors never contacted myself or my staff to verify this information. If they didn't contact our office (and I operate a significant facility), who or what else did they fail to check adequately? It's a shame, because this is a great idea, but I'm sorely disappointed."
4,One of the few coherent examinations,"This book is one of the few factual and coherent analysis offered about the new domestic terrorist movement in the United States, and prospects of future civil war in the US. One of the other coherent analysis I've seen came from the ICFI's, a socialist organization, web site. Of special interest to me were Dyer's observations on the fine but thin line between progressive and reactionary movements, and Dyer's serious consideration of the effects of the dramatic growth of economic (and hence social) inequality. Also of interest is how the economically, social and politically disenfranchized often turn to the ultra-right when no real progressive political opposition exists. Even wondered what form and face emergent fascist movements might take in the US? Then take a look arround. This book also shows that a dire need exists in the US for a real (definately NOT the Green party, which is happily lining up with the reactionaries) political alternatives."
1,Weak attempt at economic explanation of political movement,"The author obviously began with an economic theory to explain what he calls an ""antigovernment"" movement, but without the historical perspective that the movement is actually as old as the republic and is driven by dissatisfaction with corruption and abuse of power, and that the movement is stronger today because the corruption and abuses are worse than ever before. It is the same movement that led to the American Revolution, and it is motivated by the same kinds of abuses. He chooses to ignore the abuses and dismiss them as ""conspiracy theories"", but one has only to read the many books on such abuses to find the real causes of the militia movement, and learn the stories of the many victims of abuse that haven't been told yet. The author could spend his talents more usefully by writing about those stories."
3,A Question,What would happen to the thesis of this book if it turns out that the Oaklahoma City bombing was sponsored by the Iraqis?
3,Good but ...,The italian speaker on this tape is great. She is easy to understand & speaks the sylabals very clearly.The guy/english speaker is making me crazy. He almost seems to be teaching english. They jump around in a very strange manner too - example on the first tape he starts trying to teach you times on the clock before you even know the numbers. Sometimes he refers to things you have 'already discussed' but you haven't.He also keeps telling you to repeat/practice the italian but there is no time (no pause between phrases). He does go over the verb tenses (a bit fast I think) which will be helpful.I have not gotten thorugh all the tapes yet. So far it has been good to use with other tapes I've had. I think the product description is a bit misleading as far as the simplicity.
4,"Order it from Amazon, Canada","As a previous poster noted, music clearances for the songs were not made when Turner acquired the Hanna-Barbera catalog, which is why the DVD release has been delayed -- in the US.But for some reason, that has not stopped release of this DVD in Canada -- so go to Amazon.ca. I've ordered DVDs from them numerous times and the prices are usually reasonable (in fact, better, if the US Amazon is featuring the same selection as an import: compare prices on the DUE SOUTH box sets from Allied Entertainment).For those who do that eBay thing, you can occasionally spot A MAN CALLED FLINTSTONE as an Asian market VCD. Legit, not black market. That's how I got my copy."
3,Return of a 60's relic,"The Man Called Flintstone was a feature length movie released in 1966 with the original Flintstones cast and voices.The movie itself is mildly entertaining and places the characters in a spy type setting which reflected the era's craze for the 007 movies. It is a must for all serious collectors of Flintstone or Hanna Barbera animation ,and is a welcome sign that the vaults are finally being flung open. Now if only the Groovy Ghoulies or Atom Ant would see the light of day!!"
1,cheap priced dvd,I grew up watching the original tv flintstones and series was better. This movie cartoon is so dumb I forced myself to finish watching it. DVD was cheap so it does'nt matter.
1,Just An Idea,"Hey Kevin E. Miller, you may answer Bernard Kuszak and my question. Why did they pull this movie back off the shelves? Maybe someone important also didn't like what Warner Brothers did and there might be an argument going on about it. Kevin, I have a VHS copy of ""The Man Called Flintstone"" that show Wilma Flintstone in the Columbia Picture's Logo so you are right. Because of that simple little change somebody on the top probably complain. I am only speculating here so do not quote me. Whatever the reason is I will be happy when WB or Columbia Pictures release this film on DVD. I gave this one star for the same reason Bernard gave it a two stars."
3,It's just OK,"This 66 Flintstone spy spoof is just okmy 8 yr old daughter enjoyed it although she has'nt asked for a repeat viewing of the show.There were a few too many song/ fillers that did'nt add anything to the plot or the pace of this movie.If you love the flintstones then you will probably want to own it,if you are just a casual viewer you better off renting it."
4,Good but...,I miss the Wilma Columbia Pictures opening. At least they didn't cut the music. They just replaced the Wilma image with other images from the film.
5,Does the job.,"My original bobbin threader came with a fly tyng kit, the Griffin threader replaces it. There's not much to what a bobbin threader does. You stick it up the tube of a bobbin, insert the thread, then use it to pull the thread through - a simple, time proven idea. I do like the red ball on the end of the bobbin threader. This makes it easy to locate among other tools. If you are learning fly tying, you will use your bobbin threader a lot!"
1,Fun but not Practical,"Not really working, steam does not seem enough, or you have to point it very close to the dirty spot; then you are worrying about burning or discoloring or shattering(if glass)."
3,Dated but Nice CD by Dino,"This was actually Dino's second cd release, followed by ""The Way I Am"". Dino's first release was ""24/7"". Generally it's an ok cd considering it is very much influenced by the popular musical stylings of 1990. The dance songs have a good beat while the slower songs lean more towards soft grooves. Nice piece of 90s nostolgia."
4,I love kandi,Kandi Burruss is sooo underated as a solo artist this is my 2nd time buying this album. The first one is scratched up I played it soo much. I had to buy it again. I love this album and kandi koated as well.
3,Phish meets VH1,"Aagghh! Phish goes mainstream! This is not the best Phish album out there by far. It almost seems like Farmhouse was designed to garner some radio play for the boys from Vermont. This is an OK album to buy if you have never heard Phish, and want a 3 minute catchy tune. But otherwise, get a bootleg, live disc, or catch a show. For the newer listener, I would suggest Lawn Boy, Picture of Nectar, or even Billy Breathes over this disc. I have seen most of the songs on Farmhouse live, and they are infinitely better. Thank god summer tour starts soon."
4,A new age,"For those of us who consider ourselves phans, Farmhouse may produce mixed emotions. This is the first album where there are several likely hits, and it scares many of the fans who think that if the band gets too big it will ruin them.To these people, I say have faith. Just as Phish has continuously explored all diferent forms of music (while creating a few along the way), they now have created a magnificent pop album. Pop is a musical genre just like any other, and songs like Heavy Things, Twist Around, and Get Back on the Train are just that. The inclusion of concert favorites like First Tube and Piper is welcome, but it is nice to see that the band can explore an often overlooked musical medium and come out smelling like roses.All in all, this definitely not Phish's best album, but it is an incredible album by musical standards, and to miss out on it would be a real loss."
3,SO much better than Ghost,"Nice album. While it will not go down as their best, Farmhouse has some great moments. Gone are the attempts at making an album that lives up to a show, replaced are insightful, quieter songs mixed with little pieces to git yer ass movin'."
4,Tight Album,Nice tight album comprised of 12 quality songs. I have listened to the entire album three times already and it gets better each time.
3,Bob Marley is turning in his grave!,"Gee, ""Farmhouse"" is a catchy little tune...perhaps because we've all heard it before! Why is there not any talk about Phish copying the title track on this CD from Bob Marley? (except for Brian P. Lonergan's review)Are Phans too devoted to acknowledge this?I'm a big fan of Phish, but this album is far from the 5 stars many reviewers gave it. Actually, the second half might get 4 stars, but the first half only 2. ""Farmhouse"" was taken from Marley, ""Back on the Train"" '-yeee-haaaw!' and ""Heavy Things"" is played thrice daily on the pop radio station my sister listens to.From ""Gotta Jibboo"" on it's pretty solid. But overall a disappointment."
5,WOW! Farmhouse rocks!!!,"This album is awesome. I first became acquainted with Phish through his collaboration with Dave Matthews, and I have to say that the band has come a long way on their own. Many songs remind me of Beatles' hits, yet hold their own originality. Get this cd if you're sick of NSYNC and Britney and enjoy listening to actual guitar/alternative music. Dave Matthews fans: this is definitely a must!"
2,Farmhouse Sharmhouse...,"The music is great on the cd, it's just that I think this cd was aimed at getting all the tenny boppers into our scene, and I kinda hope that the next album isn't like this. No offense to newbies though, it's just the little girls and boy who go just to get drunk or something, that really gets on my nerves, expecially when there is 1000 real phish heads outside the venue with no tix. And all they do is walk around and get in everybody's way. But I welcome anybody into Phish that likes the music!! Come and have PHUN!"
3,Listen only once,"If you listen to this once you might say WOW! But after listening a few times, the listener will see that this Phish does not match their awesome musical talents. Along with many of the other reviewers, I too love recorded Phish, although it does not even come close to a show which I urge all fans and even tentative fans to do (if you can try to go to both East and West Coasts). The problem with this album is the lack of staying power. The tunes are catchy but they wear on you, whereas with Billy Breathes another ""pop"" album, the more you listen to the album, the more awesome songs show up. Although this album rocks because it will bring in some more Phishheads to the following, it lacks the emotion and savvy of some of Phish's best releases."
2,Phlop,"If you are just starting out listening to phish, do not get this album. Maybe if you like nsync or some other ""pop"" band will you like this. With only a few exceptions, most of the songs are too ""radio friendly"", expecially 'farmhouse' and 'heavy things'. I would highly reccomend ""A Live One"" because it is a great example of their best music, the live stuff."
2,Not Phish,"Get a real phish cd (slip, stich, and pass, or rift), not this mainstream stuff- the stuff isn't bad- but if you're a real phish fan, you'll know where i'm coming from- this cd is the equivalent of the Grateful Dead's ""Skeletons from the CLoset."""
4,Not so Shaby but... is it not the same cd?,"By all means Farmhouse is a great album, probably the best all studio, (not including the crowd noise inserted) album Phish has relased with the exception of Rift... although all of the albums generaly appeal to me. I gueses the main question is are the two extra songs and some japanese writting worth the extra 15 dollars for the same album? Well frankly many people would say that 32 dollars is deffanitly a resonable amount for some whistles and bells. not to mention the ability to not pay sales tax on this item makes it even more appealing."
4,"this is a very good cd, but not their best stuff","this cd is great! it has the greatest songs on it like farmhouse, heavy things, piper, and first tube. unfortunately, its not their best. but still, get this cd!"
1,horrible,"These guys are seeking radio play so vehemently, they have sacrificed the very things that earned them their early cadre of fans - humor, sponteneity, and musical virtuosity. If it were not for these qualities, their entire fan base would not exist. This album (along with Billy Breathes) is a perfect example of how much this once exciting band has sold out. P.U."
1,too pop...and too radio-friendly.,"I'm not sure how the boys were when they made this CD, but it sounds a little gay. Nobody's perfect, but I hope whenever they make another CD, they'll rebound and put out one that'll make-up for this one.For Ren and Stimpy fans, I'll give my best Mr. Horse impersonation and say...""No sir......I don't like it."""
1,SATAN SATAN SATAN SATAN,"Satan has possessed all of your rotten, ""pot"" filled souls. I hope all of you enjoy the phish rhythms, beats, and all around jams because you all will surely burn for your laughter and joy. When trey sings ""God isn't one of these"" I would have liked to burn his hide with the rod of the mighty lord, but instead I prayed for his sins and the sins of all the lizard sinners. When the phish get all funky and tripped out on ""Gotta Jibbo"" I thought I was going to get a contact (if you hippies know what I mean). I hope the lord takes mercy on your snake bitten, resin filled, dank, sticky, fluffhead worlds. You phish people are doing the work of satan, especially on that creepy, crafty song ""Back on the train"" - is that a reference to the ride satan takes on the crazy acid train? Interesting, isn't it? Pray for forgiveness phish people the lord is coming - try reading ""left behind"" by Jerry Jenkins. It will save your life."
3,May be for PHANS only,"I bought this album reluctantly, as I do with all of their studio albums. But, after hearing ""Heavy Things"" on Letterman, my interest was piqued. I listened to it 4 times in a row after I bought it, and it's not bad. I haven't seen them live in two years, and wanted to familiarize with some of the songs before checking them out this summer. As everyone is saying, ""Sand"" and ""First Tube"" are amazing, they must be mind-blowing live. I also really like ""Heavy Things"". Other than that, the album won't blow you away, but if you're like me, you gotta have it anyway. Can't wait to check out the new stuff this summer and hope to see the rest of you out there!"
3,What's the point?,"""Farmhouse"" is an album that will entirely please neither the band's live cult followers nor the mainstream radio audience they are apparently courting with it. Oh, it's catchy enough I suppose, and the band's playing is loose and expert. But for the most part, these songs are pretty meaningless. ""Heavy Things"" sounds fine on first listen, but after a few more you realize that it isn't really saying anything, and that annoying beep that keeps time in the background gets to be a bit much. Of course, by the time we've ingested this album Phish is probably off in some entirely new direction. Let us hope that they find a way to back up the fluff with something meatier to justify further interest in the band, let alone to justify devoting your life to chasing them around the country."
3,DID YOU SEE IT?,"I stand by my review featured above, the songs on ""Farmhouse"" are not given the attention to detail that they deserve, IMHO. Perhaps the laid-back setting in which it was recorded caused the Phab Phour to be a bit cavalier with the final product? Anyway, did YOU notice the fish head on the cover? It's facing left - the star is the fish's eye . . . . ."
3,And yet another by Phish...,"For those of you who are new to Phish, or are aging veterans, this CD is yet another one to add to the collection. I had the luxury of owning it before it was even released. I don't think this CD compares to any of the old stuff that Phish has chosen to forget, the upbeat and energetic music that put you in an incredible mood on the way to school or work. The songs that in concert make you scream and start jumping up and down. Nope, this CD just kind of leaves you there. It is good, don't get me wrong. It is nice to see Piper make it onto an album, but what about NICU. I guess that one is stuck to the bootlegs. Anyway, if you don't want to have your mood picked up or just kind of want to drift off to sleep this is the album for you. Other than that, stick to Rift!"
2,What Is All The Complaining About,"This is definitely not Phish's best album. In fact, it very well may be their worst. Nonetheless, the complaints that this album has strayed from previous albums are unfounded. No one can say that Story of the Ghost or Billy Breathes were any less mainstream. And as for Hoist, Down With Disease is the most altered studio song in the band's history. You have to go all the way back to Lawn Boy to get studio stuff that sounds remotely similar to the live Phish sound, but even this masterpiece has been altered, as Page's piano solo at the close of Squirming Coil would attest. So give Phish a break and understand that this stuff is not what it is live. Do understand, though, that Farmhouse's playlist is worse than any album to date (perhaps with the exception of Ghost). Outside of First Tube and Piper this is not GREAT Phish. It is, however, the work of the best band of our time."
2,In a barn,"Phish has done a fine job over their long career of finally proving that most rock concerts are totally meaningless. These four guys, ugly as sin, desperately trying to come up with postmodern things to mess about with on stage, have somehow managed to capture the hearts and lives of a number of apparently unfulfilled people who chase their anti-idol idols all over the country for lack of a life. With this album, the band finally tries to do something worth listening to if you aren't a groupie. They fail. It takes more than a catchy riff and some loose playing to make a legitimate hit. No, those of us who caught a wiff of this would-be commercial stuff would do best to leave it to their devoted fans."
3,Listen closer...it's there,"I am surprised by these reviews for Farmhouse. It never dawned on me not to be thoroughly satisfied with this new album of Phish. I think it is a powerful production with a menagerie of musical imagery and spirit. The ""Barn"" creates a a studio tone that is unmatched and exciting to listen to. I hope everyone has the sense to buy this recording - it's especially great for summertime!"
3,Enjoyable to the Casual Fan,"Casual fans of the band will enjoy this album. If you enjoyed ""Hoist,"" it's a worthy addition to your collection. If you dropped out of school for a semester to follow Phish around the country, you may be disappointed by the lack of extended jams."
4,Good for a first timer!,"Farmhouse: this is another installment, replete with a standard phish groove and thoughtful lyrics, most of the songs we've heard live at one show or the next. This album is far more radio-friendly, some of the songs even have refrains and chorus. For a long time fan, this continues the progression Phish has made from billy to ghost. And although it lacks the free-form of preceding albums, it is that precisely that makes it bareable to newer fans."
4,Good but not perfect,"I really enjoyed this album, it had some great catchy tunes which im singing right now. However, i got it the day after i went to their concert and the album didnt live up to the live show. I recommend this album to phans but i still think... Phish is meant to be heard live."
2,Cord kinks up quickly making the curling iron difficult to use,"The curling iron heats quickly and to a high temperature and curls hair well however, the cord twists and twists and twists and ties itself into a knot so that within 3 uses a 5 foot cord is reduced to 1 foot of knot. No other curling iron does this. It is a real pain in the but to use this iron."
5,Sweet!,"Bravo! Brazilian guitarist/songwriter Guniga gathers an impressive array of guests and explores a wide variety of Brazilian music. The choro, waltz, samba, and more all played with great lyricism and technique. Great orchestra tracks, quiet solos, jazzy combos, fun duos...it's a most eclectic CD united by a Brazilian flair and truly top-of-their game performers. A wonderful CD."
4,great merseybeat,great collection from this long lost merseybeat outfit even though jackie lomax would go on to bigger things in the later 60s and into the 70s these are his earliest recordings and as you can see some where holed up in a vault for 30 + years so it is great to have them included on this great collection along with the few 45s the undertakers put out back in 64 and 65.
5,Tribble trouble,I a pretty big fan of Star Trek think that this is one of the most valued of all DS9 episodes. You'll wan't to watch it over and over again. But one thing bothers me all klingons used to be are ugly people but now they've improved immensly.
5,Excellent resource,"Actually, Oxford is one of the best Russian-English/English-Russian dictionaries available. NO dictionary is going to have separate entries for different declensions or conjugations of a word--you must always know the standard form (for adjectives--masculine gender, subjective case; for nouns--subjective case; for verbs--infinitive form). The Oxford dictionary, in combination with another gold standard, Smirnitsky, got me through life in Russia and a graduate degree in Russian. I can't help wondering if the previous reviewer's fiancee isn't writing at least partially in Ukrainian (since she lives in Ukraine, it would make sense)--in which case a Ukrainian/English dictionary would be most helpful. I'm sorry for that small rant, but I couldn't let the last reviewer's derogatory comments about an EXCELLENT standard reference work go."
1,THIS BOOK IS THE NEXT THING TO USELESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My fiancee lives in Kharkov, Ukraine. She has tried to send me Email messages in Russian. When I try to translate them, less than 2% of the words she sends me can be found in this (dictionary????) It does not show feminine references or different usages of words unless you know the root word. In my opinion this book would not even make good toilet paper!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Classic,I love this necklace. The drop pendant is smaller than I imagined but it is still beautiful and classic in styling. The chain is very dainty and is adjustable in length. This is well worth the $19 I paid (especially with free shipping!)
4,Nice Gift,"This piece is simple, clean, and well worth the money. Amazon packages this pendant like good jewelry. It makes fine gift."
4,Loved It.....now I want one....,I bought this as a gift and now I want one - very elegant - not cheap looking at all - looks great on my cousin.....
4,Pokemon: Diamond and Pearl Galactic Battles Box Set 1,"Very good for those who like Pokemon. While it is not my personal favorite of the series, it is still very good. It has several funny parts, a gym battle, and a pokemon that evolves. I am not sure what else as I have not finished watching the box set. Fans of the series will probably want the box set to complete their collection. The episodes on the box set are:1 Get Your Rotom Running!2 A Breed Stampede!3 Ancient Family Matters!4 Dealing with Defensive Types!5 Leading a Stray!6 Steeling Peace of Mind!7 Saving the World From Ruins!8 Cheers on Castaways Isle!9 Hold the Phione!10 Another One Gabites the Dust!11 Stealing the Conversation!12 The Drifting Snorunt!13 Noodles! Roamin' Off!14 Pursueing a Lofty Goal!15 Trials and Adulations!Any pokemon fan will probably like this. People who like action with some comedy without having to much violence also might like this."
4,solid but not spectacular,"You most likely have heard of them because of:hard act to followInteresting point: founded by tripple jBest song played loud:hard actBest slow song:better off aloneBest Lyrics:nothin spectacular, hold on me.My favourite:chokeDont like:lacking a bit of excitement i thinkAlso good by this band: chemical heart,lost controlIf you like this look out for:try thirsty merc"
4,Solid rock and roll on any continent,"An Aussie friend of mine recommended this band to me on a recent trip to Australia. This became the soundtrack to my entire trip as it rarely left my IPod and still gets plenty of play today. Great hooks and guitar riffs more than make up for occasionally banal lyrics. ""Bleed You Dry"" and ""Thrills, Kills & Sunday Pills"" highlight the heavier side, and ""She's Leaving Tuesday"" is a great ballad. Worth trying out!"
4,A sound effort from these aussie rockers,"This fourth album from Grinspoon is another success.Key tracks include: Hard Act To Follow, Better Off Alone,Hold On Me, Rising Tide and Enemy.This is not their best album but it is very good as they were exploring new areas in their musicianship.Even though there was alot of criticism over the softer sound, it still has it's heavy moments and memorable tracks.The softer sound is their first step to becoming a better band with their songwriting ability. Also if they made another album that was exactly the same as their previous album ""New Detention"" it would just be an average ""safe"" album.Grinspoon were probably aiming at a different audience with this release.It's worth the money."
5,Wonderful resource!,I have wanted to buy these books for a long time and they are every bit as good as I hoped!
5,Great Texts,Invaluable texts for trigger point acupuncture. Easy index layout to find correct muscles to treat.
5,The Right Person for Sentimental Jazz,"Houston Person just gets better, and this 2000 album from HighNote shows the tenor saxophonist at his ballad-playing best. Stan Hope on piano, George Kaye on bass and Chip White on drums do a fine job of letting Person express himself on the 12 tunes. It's just under an hour of romantic but interesting mood music for you -- either by yourself or, better yet, with someone very special."
4,Unknown Paris,"What has already been said is wonderful, I just want to add that these are black and white photos-a lot of late 1800's Paris;no advertising on buildings, a mood of being there is created, a sense of a more sedate time is created in these photos, a slower pace is the feeling here. No modern hectic, rush, stress,get-ahead Paris that can be currently photographed. These old photos are so very well done, they are still pleasurable to view."
3,tip for owners of this book,"I haven't read it, but I've seen it and it looks like a good book. I'm writing this review to pass on this info to anyone who might be able to use it. The following is something I picked up from someone else:Liked the variety of selections in this book. Can't give it an outstanding because my copy has at least one erratum. After an email to Family Circle I received this correction for page 30 ""Portable Throw [for] beginner knitters"". 3/4 of the way down the left hand column and under ""Stitches -- Chevron and Feather"" you will find ROW 1 of the Pattern. It reads:""Row 1(RS)*K1,yo, W""<====this ""W"" should be replaced by ""k4"" and then continue on. In my opinion this pattern is better for intermediate knitters, it contains 'lace' stitches. However, if you can master yo's (yarn over's) and K2tog's (knit two together's) you can knit this lovely afghan very quickly. Also wrong: crochet afghans (2nd half of bk)are listed for ""knitters"" levels."
4,Good helpfull book and was a clean used book.,This book is very helpfull i got some good projects from it . and I will use it a lot.
5,A Good Chemistry Starter Kit,"A great price for educational experiments. My 6 yr-old and 4 yr-old both enjoyed making snow and playing with gooey polymers. I was amazed as well, especially by the easy-to-understand instructions and interesting science facts."
1,Big disappointment - avoid,"The pieces are poorly cut. The vibrant colors used in the painting are so muted you can't tell them apart. What should be bright reds are dark, burgundys. Also the picture on the cover of the box shows less of the actual puzzle. I think some of the pieces are missing. This is not a challenging puzzle - it is irritating!"
1,"If I could give it a zero, I would.","Roger G.Kennedy is a man on a mission: to embellish, lie and slander Thomas Jefferson. Kennedy is the typical modern biographer,always ready to destroy another one of America's heroes. In the sad and cynical fashion of today, Kennedy does his best to paint Thomas Jefferson as a lousy President, slaveholder and racist. The book is deplorable, just as most modern American history has become. I am sure the modern left, postmodernist, deconstructionist crowd loves this piece. It has all of the nihlism, lies, and propaganda one would expect from a ""profession"" laden with Marxists and Leninsts who would like nothing better than to see another American icon destroyed. A real piece of garbage."
5,People who use people (and the environment),"Roger Kennedy has written a great book. Thomas Jefferson's Cause was truly lost because the planters and slavers whom he represented continued to use up people and land until they were stopped at the Civil War. Thus the internal contradiction of the plantation system worked itself out. Hopefully, others will pick up where Kennedy left off, and continue to trace the strain (or stain) of the users up to the present day. Just as slave owners used slaves in labor and other ways, they also used up the land in a grossly wasteful way. We see their ilk with us today in the oil industry, the lumber industry, and in the political helpers of the inheritors of the tradition of the planters and slavers. These are the ones who use things and people up, and then move on to greener pastures where they can continue their destructive ways."
1,Disappointing,"The author fails to see things with the eyes of the generation about which he is writing. That makes for bad history, merely the out-of-context attachment of situations, strung together into a book. How disappointing. However, he cannot be very lonesome. I'm afraid he has the company of a lot of clever, educated, useless historians (so-called) these days."
5,concise and interesting,Asimov puts his own spin on info that could otherwise be dry and boring. An excellent rendition of the history of the world. Offers scary insight into our tribalistic species.
5,A Fantastic Book,"The title says it all. This book starts at the beginning of the universe and ends at the end of World War II. He breaks up time periods, which get increasingly smaller as history gets more elaborate (a thousand year period, a hundred years, twenty years). In each period he starts with the most historically important geographical area at the time, then covers other areas of the world. If I were to give this book any negatives, it would be that he doesn't go into extreme detail in any area. But considering the size of the book (648 pages, not including the index) it's no wonder. He is throrough enough to get a good idea of any time period.He writes in a very easy, conversational style. If you have ever wanted to learn history but found acadimic writings to be to boring, then this book is for you."
5,Possibly the best one volume history of the world.,"Asimov is an acknowledged genius. This book is a great example of the man's genius.A general problem with history books is seeing how the little bit you are looking at fits in with the big picture. Asimov doesn't over-analyse - he gives his history in bite sized chunks so the thread of the overall historical flow remains undisrupted.Asimov has the good sense to draw the book to a close while it is still history 50 years before his writing date. The little mention of his birth is just one of the many points that raises a smile.I would have liked more on Australia, but I guess like many parts of the world the stuff Australia did up to the middle of the 20th Century did not have major international impacts.Start reading your history here and then specific areas afterwards."
4,An Incredable Achivement,"This book is a masterpiece of reference books. Asimov has compiled a giantic timeline of human civilization. Each time period has been subdivied into individual countries, empires, and regions(when there wasn't a country to speak of). Within each country section, he gives the most important information first, ending with scientific and artistic achievements. The book ends in 1945 with him siting the segnificance of that year and the fact that he would never be able to catch up with current history. The one weakness is that the majority of history given is Western, but that is understandable considering the lack of written reccord in the Pacific and Sub-Saharan Afican regions."
3,Won G = Playa,Yo I met this playa in da 818. Hes a good man. His cd is aiiiiiiiiiight. Lazy Bone is a true playa.
4,LOVE,"thier lyricism is something you must get use to and some people probably just dont like them because they are alittle out there. i like this album because the music is really good and #4 I STILL WONDER is such an awesomely flowing song, it is worth buying the cd. also the drumming is really great and the drum solo towards the end of the album is just AMAZING. love is an important band to the 60's and LA scene and this is a good album in my opinion."
4,speed of delivery,"The textbook, ""Oral Presentations for Technical Communication,"" was delivered at a satisfactory time allowing me to have it for my first class. The condition was as reported so I have no complaints about that."
3,size was wrong,"the product itself was fine, but the sizing seems to be a little off. I ordered a M/L for my husband, which is a standard size he wears, and this hat was cutting off his circulation in his skull, it was so tight! Just FYI, go a size up!!!"
3,It's ok but not more,I really like the cap design but the front (the whit part) is a bit collapsed when you have it on and that sucks
5,"deeply psychological,,,dangerous journey to self-discovery","A compact book that is powerfully insightful about the passages to self discovery and individuation, like The Cather of the Rye, but alot more disciplined and poetic style of writing. (which I actually prefer) The life of the promising young boy, whose identity was molded by expectations by others and confinements of the system, drastically changes as new judgment standards are introduced by his relationship with Hermann's character and Han's cognitive dissonance ultimately leads him to the ending of the book. (no spoiler). This book, although not hard to guess the ending from the title, is highly interactive with the reader through its powerful motifs."
5,masterpiece,"I like this better than all of Hesse's other books because it paints such a vivid picture of the downfalls of modern education. The rigid intellect is stressed that crushes the human spirit and creative mind. So you can bubble a few circles on a scantron? So what! This book is incredible in describing how pushy adults live their lives through youth. When you find me floating down the river, don't ask why, just look in the mirror. Pure genius. Read and never look at your education the same way."
4,Pretty good,"I've been drinking the dandelion root tea by traditional medicinals for a while, but switched to the detox because it was included in Subscribe and Save and seemed similar. It is fairly similar, although it has a much more floral (and somewhat strange) taste. I've been drinking it for a while, so I've gotten used to it, but I prefer the taste of the dandelion root. Seems to have the same sort of health benefits though!"
2,"Wife made me drink this on a dare, but it wasn't horrible.","Starts out with a licorice/anise smell that quickly turns into something more ""bark-like"". Like wood that has rotted in a wet forest. The smell fades to a miso soup odor. Tastes a bit neutral. Again, non-salty miso is the closest thing I can compare it to."
1,Black liquorice,"Smells like Black liquorice which to me is a bad thing. could drink it without holding my nose, which wasn't enjoyable at all so if your don't like Black liquorice then this isn't for you"
4,Good book especially if you are from Brooklyn,"This book is Lovell's 2nd ""Blades Overstreet"" novel, the 2nd of many more to come (I hope!). I really liked the story line in this book, It kept me turning pages to see what was going to happen. I especially liked that it was set in Brooklyn and mentions some of the establishments that I myself have frequented throughout the years. this helped to make me feel like I was a part of the book. I found myself imagining that I was Blades and all this was happening to me! In my opinion that is what makes good writing. Keep up the good work Glenville!!"
3,Not a complete season.,This thing was published March 30. It only has stats and season recaps through the Northwestern game. The Final Four was in April.PROS Great Pictures.CONS No BTT coverage. No NCAA coverage.
5,"History, not HIS STORY",This book is amazing. It is large and will take time for you to get through. But this is the most accurate book about the Egyptian Civilization. It also has chapters about the early beginnings of man and womankind. This book explains history in a way that no other group or book has the guts to. It is honest and does not censor things out of religious prudence.This is the best book you could possibly get if you are interested in Egypt.I would recommend this book to anyone who has the patience and an open mind.
4,"Fun, but items come off easily.","My son loved this belt. It has fun gadgets, but they were hard toget on and off for a youngster. They have to fit in a holeand then slide. When playing, though, some items came off.On Halloween night, we lost the batarang holder which causeddistress for our son. We had to retrace steps and never found it.If used with care, this is a great belt."
3,My Son Loves It,"I agree with the reviewers who stated that the pieces are hard to put on/remove for a 3 year old (he's asking me for help to remove the shooter thing now...) and the foam darts are easily lost (he opened it yesterday, there's 1 of the 3 darts left in the storage compartment. BUT, he loves it enough to want to sleep with it at night and to ask for it as soon as he wakes up and that's the point, right, for him to enjoy it? Plus, this one actually fits a 3 year old, where the reviews for the belt designed for the previous Batman movie was too large for smaller kids."
1,Just like making hot water,"I did not like this tea at all. I've bought grocery store teas that had tons of flavor, but I wanted to try this tea for the pure presumably stronger tasting experience. Even with 2 bags, this tea produces nothing more than slightly colored hot water. And one time, there was an aftertaste of dirt in a cup of tea."
3,An all around good book,This book gives precise acurate information about building several types of telescopes. The instructions are to the point and very understandable.
3,Obvious but entertaining,"Despite the tangled plot line, the killer is so obvious it makes one wonder why it takes the characters over 400 pages to literally get hit over the head with the solution---entertainingly written, though, and the characters are believable. You go, girl!!!"
1,a boy's toys,"from its pretentious title to its inane denouement, this 'product' is little more than a crass commercial collusion between a media giant (time-warner) and post o.j. marketability (christopher darden). a patchwork of the improbable and the implausible even by hollywood standards."
4,"Sharp, fast (butt?) rock","I gambled on this disc, which i only really wanted for Helmet's ""Impressionable"", which is a great track. There are many good tracks, more notably ""Before I Kill Again"", ""Lesbian Nun"", and ""Gremlin Stomp"". Most of the songs are under 3 minutes, so the longer songs seem to drag (""Capital Hillbillies"" and ""Euthanasia""). If you like Helmet or early Hüsker Dü, this CD should be right up your alley."
2,not Etta's best,"Despite the title, this is not Etta's best blues performance. When she's hot she's hot. This stuff is pretty perfunctory."
1,Pastel blues,A remarkable lack of mojo renders this suitable only as background music in fast food suburban restaurants - I guess the hokey cover photo should have warned me. If you want full-on Jamesian mojo then play her Matriarch of the Blues album LOUD! - see p2 of my reviews.
5,A Long Time Coming,"I first heard this CD back in 1992 and I borrowed from the public library. I loved it so much I made a copy of it on a cassette tape but lost it soon after and couldn't find the CD at the library anymore. Fast forward 15 years later and I finally found someone who had a copy of this great and unappreciated CD. My favorite song, the first track ""Camille"" is just a slow, smooth song and always relaxes me that I'll never forget. Listen to the whole CD just once and you'll be hooked."
1,Smashes garlic as much as it slices,"I've used this item many times and it's not really worth it. It will make good slices of about half of each clove, however, at the beginning of slicing a clove and at the end the garlic tends to get smashed and gummed up in the presser or in the blade. Also, it's difficult to get down to the very end of a clove since the press doesn't really allow you to press down completely to the blades. Finally, the metal part is small and poorly balanced making it difficult to use."
3,It's okay,The concept is terrific and the unit is functional. The reasOn for three stars is that the slide that holds the garlic catches the blade slightly before being forced through. If the cutting edge was angled it would operate smoother
5,SUPER EASY TO USE,"I love this product. Use it all of time. It's super easy to use, clean, and makes perfect slices for drying."
1,Not representative of contemporary Dutch music,"If you like to hear traditional Dutch songs, you should perhaps consider buying this record. If you're looking for something more popular try Marco Borsato's CD ""De Waarheid""!"
2,pretty rusty,We have used this since last summer and it has been getting really rusty. It is covered in the winter time so you would think it would not get that bad but it has been. It has been staining our patio with rust spots. Not too thrilled about that
3,Good cheesy fun,"Your enjoyment (or eye-rolling dismissal) of this deliberately kitschy side project by members of Jellyfish and Air depends on whether you can buy into the one-joke premise: This is the soundtrack for an imaginary sequel to the 1976 sci-fi film ""Logan's Run"". Within that context, the project certainly delivers that mid-70's feel with almost exclusive use of assorted ""vintage"" synths and keyboards. Power-pop wunderkind Jason Falkner delivers in spades on the anthemic ""Search For Tomorrow"", the lone vocal performance in this otherwise all-instrumental set. In thier better moments,some songs recall Kraftwerk's ""Computer World"" period; the one or two clunkers sound like generic porno soundtrack fill (uh, er, I mean,not that I WATCH a lot of that stuff...)At any rate, if you already get a kick out of Air, High Llamas or Stereolab, you'll likely find this a pleasant diversion."
4,Manning and Falkner-- together!,"For all Jellyfish fans, this is a very big deal. Ex-Jellyfish Roger Manning has been touring with Beck, and now has his first chance to shine for himself. Album takes you back to the days when Manning was in Moog Cookbook, an all-synth band. Sound of the album is very futuristic synth, and features another ex-Jellyfish Jason Falkner on some vocals and stuff. Check this out!"
5,"If you like Air, you'll like this one too.","The duo featured here also played on Air's tour, and the drummer played on Air's Virgin Suicides album, and is going to be on the new one. It sounds like a happier Virgin Suicides, but perhaps a bit funkier. A must have for Air fans in general. Particularly tracks 7 and 9 which you can't even sample here."
4,"You'd have to be a fan, though...","This is a must-have if you're a fan of ""Logan's Run"" and/or these musicians; otherwise, it'd be more like two or three stars, I think. Much of the music itself is indeed the type of music you'd expect to hear in a ""Logan's Run""-like film, but it doesn't hold a candle to Jerry Goldsmith's original soundtrack.Luckily, this fun, clever project was clearly not meant to be taken that way. The tracks are pleasant to listen to (""Search for Tomorrow"" is especially haunting), but what really makes this CD a must-have for ""Logan's Run"" fans is the packaging. The cover and liner notes are amazingly authentic; there are photos from the ""movie"" and a brief synopsis of the plot (which doesn't reveal the story's ending). If there'd been a cheesy, low-budget sequel to the original film, this could well have been it. The music complements it perfectly.If you're a fan of these musicians or of ""Logan's Run,"" you MUST have this CD."
4,"Nice, Affordable Hibiscus Tea","All good and as described. Kind of sweet, bought for lowering blood pressure. Too soon to know if it makes any difference but it seems like a very nice tea."
5,Hibicus tea,Healthy...supposed to lower colesteral. Great taste; Ships immediately from this company!Only draw back is they are not individually packaged.
4,Very Good!,"I have been drinking another brand of hisbiscus tea for a while now, and came across this brand, and decided to try it! I was not disappointed! It is very tasty with that kick of lemongrass. I add a teaspoon of honey and sit back and enjoy! It has the dark red color of my other brand, and from now on I will be purchasing both brands! Cannot say yet if this brand has lowered my blood pressure, but I know the other brand did and since they are both hisbiscus, I would imagine that this would too!"
1,Hibiscus Tea Certifed Organic24 teabags,I tried drinking the tea and it made me chock on it. I believe that is was an allergic reaction to the tea leaves. I gave it away to a friend of mine that recommended in the first place. I am sorry that it happened that way because of the benefits that is applied to my health.
5,Good transaction,I ordered this book for my son. We received the book very quickly and in good condition. He started reading it the day it came in.
2,Rusts!,"A beautiful set by a quality maker ""Wallace"", but unfortunately, this set is poorly made and will rust if allowed to sit in water. This defeats the purpose of it being stainless steel.Finally, ""Chadwick"" is a discontinued pattern by Wallace."
4,"Very nice, but color isn't even close","I have a top of the line flat panel monitor running Adobe Gamma Loader and when I take pictures and view them on it, my colors are very close to true.So, this 'linen' color, which looks like a pale pink on my monitor is actually much more like the name implies, linen, a light beige color. I expected that, but you should know that Amazon's photos can be way, way off in color.Otherwise, it's a lovely towel."
5,Miller Manufacturing AW32 32-Ounce Animal Water Bottle,"this is probably one of the most convenient water bottles I have ever seen.it's lightweight, yet tough as nails. easy to fill & clean, easy to hang on the cage, my animals have no trouble with it...I am very pleased with this purchase & I believe you will be too."
1,grace not works,MRS.Hickey needs to look at Romans 8:28-32 we are not in charge of our past present or future
4,Mmmm,"This stuff is great. I bought it a few years ago at a Japanese market and I thought to look for it again on Amazon and I found it! It's kind of tough, but that's expected because, well, it's squid. I absolutely love the spice in this. It's not overpowering, and it tastes a bit sweet as well so you get a mixture of both sweet and spicy. Also, it doesn't have an overtly fishy flavor which you may think before trying, but the fishy taste is mild."
2,Not really hot at all,"This product just tasted odd to me, like they added aspartame or some other kind of artificial sweetener, and on top of that it wasn't really that spicy. My friend introduced me to dried squid a year ago, but she'd gotten heres straight from the asian market, I bought this thinking it'd be similar but I guess not."
2,Poorly treated subject.,"Although the main point of this small book has value and, needs to be addressed by all people (Christian or not), this particular treatment is fairly useless.We are all indeed overburdened by our work and family life, and will lean more heavily to one extreme in attempting the impossible task of ""getting everything done that needs to get done.""That being said, and an obvious point, this book's style is so diluted and simple that it could be played as background chatter in a dentist office. There is no theology here, no strong Biblical support. Rather, you will find here cute anecdotes, colorless stories and dinner table pabulum at a low budget counseling seminar. These are not deep Biblical truths, but cheap examples of popular pseudo-psychology.If you search for theological and biblically rooted evidence, this is not the book for you. If on the other hand you chew on Lucado and Osteen for your daily Scriptural diet, then this book should fill your bookshelf beautifully."
5,excellent,"This book is already paying dividends at home. The family/life balance is difficult, but this book challenges you to get your priorities in order. An easy read with good insight."
5,great book for someone wanting to make family more important,This book may not have life-changing facts or profound wisdom but it does make you sit back and evaluate your life. It is a very well written book with practical and applicable advise for how to turn your focus back onto the thing that matters most - your family. Andy Stanley doesn't suggest you go out and quit your job tomorrow but has great suggestions of what you can do in order to have more time for home life. Quick read and great small group discussion at the end.
5,Choosing to Cheat,Great book by the son of the great Charles Stanley. Great insights into the choices we all have to make between work and family.
2,too expensive,too expensive for this skinny little book I saw this book in the footnotes of a really good talk so decided to order it. I will use it because I paid so much for it ... regretfully
5,"After 'HOWL', It's 'KADDISH'","Ginsberg's long-form poem about his mother is a beautiful elegy in the form of an ancient Jewish prayer for the dead. It examines the poet's relationship with Naomi Ginsberg and her illness, as well as his own childhood and adolescence.From the russian girl coming to America in the early 1920's, the socialist mom, to the mentally ill patient in her old age, Ginsberg reviews the life of a remarkable woman and the ways in which their relationship affected his life and work. And affected it did. Kaddish is also a therapeutic work for the poet, almost psychoanalitical at times, a courageous and loving exploration of the profound influence parents can have on a writer's life."
3,ok,"Shipped in timely manner; product in good condition. The song selection was not as pleasing or enjoyable as I personally like; I am more of a soulful, blues person and many of the songs were 'too bouncy' for me."
1,does not fit,"product was guaranteed to fit and it did not, vender offered to accept it if it was returned with postage paid by me."
1,Not as I expected,"Though the design is cool, the quality of this pendant is poor. They are so light and the color is strikingly white, which makes them appear cheaper. They look like toys! I also bought the earrings set with the same design and I'm so disappointed with both. :-( Only the packaging is of good quality in this product.I suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design."
2,Not crazy about it,"This necklace was not a bad purchase. Once I received it, I was not crazy about it. The chain had a large not in it when it arrived (4 weeks after I ordered it). I would not purchase this item again."
2,Too Simple!,"My daughter just turned three in November and I got this for her for Christmas because she likes looking for hidden objects treasure hunts and in Ranger Rick magazines she likes to find the objects. This book is just too simple and easy. The pictures are wonderful, but I just didn't realize how simple it would be to find the objects."
3,Back when we were fab.,"The Folded Leaf is beautiful and lucid, a compelling read and useful for showing us what life was like for a young man in the 20s. Some of the story doesn't seem to add up- for example, I never was convinced that Spud was a compelling character but hey, maybe he just wasn't my type. And the ending is tainted with the histrionics that seems to characterize so much early gay fiction (and so much of it written now). But in the end, this may not really be a gay book, so much as a book about one boy who loves another, and how they both dealt with it.Final analysis, the book is warm and generous and kind, beautifully written and quite bold. I can recommend it without hesitation to a general audience, and some should read it as a classic text (and you know who you are)."
3,"Excellent writing, mildly interesting","I agree that Maxwell wrote quite well, with very descriptive language, detail, and believable dialog. However, I found the story itself to be only mildly interesting. The relationship between the two main characters was unusual, of course, and complex in some ways, while lacking in breadth in many other ways. For example, there is neither significant action nor sophisticated philosophical discussion.Some of the scenes are strong, especially when the adults participate more. I wish the girls had more character development, as Maxwell created some interesting individuals, but left them to relatively secondary roles where a longer book could have expanded their characters and interaction."
4,"Okay mobile, great music box",My 6 week old baby will actually watch this mobile for a liitle while. I had no problem putting it on the crib. My only problem is it only plays for ten minutes and you have to be really close to use the remote.Update-We've now been using this mobile for a month and a half longer and my baby still likes it but the mobile has an awful clicking like the gears are missing.Update-My son is now 19 months old and this is still in his crib without the moving pieces. He loves it still to go to sleep but now he can turn the music on. Without the moving arms a door flips down to cover the holes and you can turn the internal mechanism off so just music plays. We tried taking it out of his crib cause the batteries were dead but he wouldn't sleep well till it was put back in.
4,Marva Hicks,"This CD WAS PRETTY GOOD, BUT THR MAIN TRACK THAT MADE IT WORTH BUYING IS NEVER BEEN IN LOVE BEFORE. CHECK IT OUT!!!"
5,Great resource,"I picked up the book last week and found sound great sites I didn't know about - was able to get some holiday shopping done early for once. Great for those hard to find gifts, as well as everyday items. Very user friendy, highly recommended."
4,On-line Shopping,"This is a good rendition on the various websites in existence for a varietyof goods and services on the internet. The volume is well organized. It iseasy to read and the price is reasonable. An update of the volume would bein order for the 2007-2008 period; otherwise, the current book will suffice.This book would be helpful for identifying websites specific tothe current needs of the customer. A beauty of the work is that it is easyto locate product classifications with a minimum of effort. The acquisitionwould be helpful for anyone who shops frequently on the internet."
2,purple book,"Disappointing. The sections on womens' clothing & accessories tends toward the frumpy, or sites everybody knows already. If you are into fashion this probably isn't for you."
4,Great benchmarking tool!,"As an online retailer, this book will really help me benchmark the competition - easy to read and use!"
2,Price ratings are way wrong,"The price ratings in this book are way off...one site in the book that was marked with one dollar sign had bouquets of flowers starting at $100 on up...hardly what I would call a bargain Web site. Other than that, pretty good."
2,The Purple Book,The contents of this book can be easily found on the internet when doing a basic search.
5,Little Known Gem....,"This, along with the Groovies' ""Teenage Head"", is simply one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded. Just try and sit still with this coming out of your speakers!"
4,The Groovies flip us a bird,"The sound of the Groovies slouching ever closer towards their masterpiece (""Teenage Head""), ""Flamingo"" saw them scale back the production polish of ""Supersnazz"" and deliver a straightahead blast of roadhouse revelry. Still out of time, still commercially doomed, but riding that death train with a whoop and a holler."
3,"NOTHING NEW BUT, IT'S OK.","I just bought this cd ,because Fey's voice.I consider Fey's voice very femenine.I was expecting something new and fresh about this new album but, this is so repetitve in the rhytm, . Faltan lunas is like the third one of Fey,but more sotf.Fey said"" it's a cd to dance""however, I think is just for listening. Ok, it has some dance beats,but not to be played in a discoteque.Come'n Fey and cd label.!!!!!!!!!*song-music selection :is bad,dance pop repetitive and boring*best song : maybe ""aqui estoy"",""como un angel"" AND ""Tres Razones"" this is is very soft,but It's my favorite.*lyrics :are really good.*cd cover is really nice.Perhaps.I would like some remixes to really I dance,like Fey Said."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"It was all I could do from slipping into a coma listening to this one. Understated and ambient are one thing but ZZZZZZZZZ, oops, sorry, I was listening to the c.d. while writing this review."
5,Talk Talk's final....and best,"By the time this album appeared in 1991, their old record company, radio, and the pop music press had abandoned Talk Talk. Shame. Because they continued to grow as a band. Along with 1988's ""Spirit of Eden"", ""Laughing Stock"" is Talk Talk's best work. It's 5 tracks with depth, space, and length. Songs aren't merely songs but jams that are boiled down over and over with overdubs and occasionally layered with a minimal amount of Mark Hollis' aching singing and lyrics.If you've had even the slightest hesitation of buying this, like I did for years, get it now. You will not be disappointed."
5,The album is unparalleled creatively.,"Laughingstock was the second CD I ever bought about four years ago and is still one I return to again and again. It is like a box of secrets and I find something new again every time I listen. It is emotionally evocative, beautiful mysteriously coherent. A masterpiece."
3,Treading Water,"In a way this is a sad follow up to ""Spirit of Eden."" ""Laughing Stock"" is not bad per se, but for a band that on each new release dragged pop music further a field and injected much needed intelligence, this album feels like warmed up left overs. IT offers nothing new from ""Spirit of Eden"" and in many ways is less engaging, less well thought out and clearly not the band at the top of its game. I was crushed when it became clear the band had split for good after this was released, but really, what more could they do?Get this to make your collection complete, but by all means do not start here. I suggest ""Spirit of Eden"" and then ""Natural History."" Between those two, if you give them time to grow on you, you will end up buying everything the band has done anyway!"
2,Laughingstock in my own home,It is rare day I bring down this from attic and put on table. It rattles and whirls and bursts andthat guy moans and groans about things but it don't do much else. Pretty cover though!
5,from a very high place . . .,"I'm usually not at a loss for words, but in the case of ""Laughing Stock"" it's difficult to add much to the already impassioned reviews that have been posted here. This is extremely poetic, multi-dimensional music - if you can get on it's wavelength, it will deepen with every listening. This is transcendent music. The improvisational approach really captures a timeless perspective, and Mark Hollis' deeply felt, haunting vocals make this a recording to return to for many years to come (great for a spiritual recharge). Certain rare recordings are outside of genre and typical stylistic approaches, and when combined with real inspiration are able to make a fundamental connection with the listener - all that's required is an open mind and an open heart."
5,Laughing Stock,"Brilliant.I regard this ablum as pure genius, an absolutely unparalleled work of musical amazment--it rolls like warm water over your body, comforts one moment like cool, linen sheets, then disturbs the next like spider webs in your face or something crawling in your ear...Also, the album flows seamlessly from one song to the other in such fluid, but dynamic continuity that I have a hard time regarding the ablum as a collection of songs, but rather consider it one brilliant piece of gorgeous, disturbing music. The album is an experience that stimulates all of my senses, too, I FEEL this album, I envision this music, I taste it, smell it...it is SO real! Simply amazing!"
4,sounds like rain,"Much ink has been spilled over the experimental nature of Laughing Stock. While the structures evident here are not all conventional, there is a measured sense of design that unifies these tracks. Verses and choruses enter and depart with nary a whisper, giving this album a very organic feel. Even Hollis' lyrics are sung with this design in mind...for us the phonemes are more important than the words. What makes this album remarkable is not its form, but its tenor. It is deeply evocative and sounds like it rains down on us in a delicate Spring-shower, and occasionally, as in ""Ascension Day,"" a brief thunderstorm. Very enjoyable."
5,Totally Unrankable,"From very moment I heard the first chord of ""Taphead"" on campus radio as a Freshman at MI State Univ. in 1991, I knew this music I was destined to enjoy forever. A badly worn CD and Cassette Tape later, and ""Laughing Stock"" continues to be a valued Masterpiece in my collection.OK, the music can be ""noisy"" at times, but when the whole work is consumed by body and mind, it is the most beautiful noise that could ever be heard.Really, all things ""Talk Talk"" are gems. Every CD, nearly every song...off key broken chords in ""Does Caroline Know?""...dance floor mix of ""Such a Shame"" on History Revisited...This band challenges the way I see music. I hope any new fan will cherish this music as much as many of us do!"
1,DVD has poor VHS EP quality of classic live TV comedy.,"You will enjoy the live skits as Red adlibs with his guests. Unfortunately, you better enjoy this on a small screen TV. The DVD is mastered from a second generation VHS tape recorded at EP speed. The faces are blurry and hard to see. It's bad quality DVD's like this that makes one worry about what DVD companies to buy from."
4,Dub Champions,"Systemwide tears it up on their new EP! It's a great CD that includes remixes by The Rootsman as well as Alpha&Omega. 'Ripe Up', the fifth track, is a deadly dubed out smokers anthem. This CD (as well as any BSI Records release) should not be missed by dub fans."
3,Great Fun,"I loved most of A Traveler's History of London, right through the 18th century. Three-quarters of the way through, the book's breezy cheerful style evaporated, to be replaced by a mind-numbing list of facts. Possibly the book had to be finished quickly. Still, most of it is great fun, and it tells you where to find representative historical sites all over London. For the traveler, this is priceless. It means you're not stuck with seeing the Changing of the Guard, or other typical tourist stuff. I applaud the idea, and eagerly await the next edition."
4,where is dk???????????????,"the game is alot of fun, but where's donkey kong. HE'S MY FAVORITE and you can't play as him. ok in super duel mode you can.(you have to beat him first.) BUY THIS GAME!"
4,Simple Yet Again BUT STILL FUN,"I did a review on MARIO PARTY 4, and my title was simple But SO MUCH FUN. I own every single mario game for the gamecube and i have to say this one was just like number 4. Simple. I like the minigames and orbs but the music and boards were not thrilling. I always said ""come on nitendo, get cray' like they did for party 6&7 which where great! This game did have my favorite player TOAD and a koopakid? That was a waste. Party 4 is better than this one. To conclude my review i'll have to say...""THANK-YOU-SO-MUCH-For-To-READING MY REVIEW~:):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)"
2,this is old,First of all the mario party games are so old now and are getting to be boring. 50 buck for this game is terrible its not even worth 30. Nintendo needs to take my advice and start a fresh idea before they die out. Yes yes do not shoot me yet i will probly get this iteam when it is 30 ( with nintendo it might not be till 2009) but it is getting to old and boring. The same mini games over and over and over. Its been going on since 1998. lets get a FRESH IDEA HEAR NINTENDO [...]
4,Awsome!!!,"MP5 is the best MP!The Super Duel Mode has fast machies,the caples are great,best one Chance,the Bouns Mode is better than the one in MP4,the DK mini-games are awsome plus the other ones,the Mini-Game Mode has new games,so this MP is a must-have MP!!!"
1,Over the Limit,"Mario Party 4 was ok but this version pushed it. First of all, Bumper Balls (a classic) is not in MP5. The games are not that fun and Nintendo could've done better. Stick with MP4. Frankly, I belive the N64 versions were much better (MP3 especially). Don't get this game. It's a waste of your money and time."
2,Little Boring,"The GOOD Things:3 more players to choose from !! Boo, Baby Bowser and Toad70 New Mini Games !!More Boards3 extra-gamesThe BAD thingsDonkey Kong Can't be choose as a player, he disappeared...(well, not completely because now gives you coins)The Boards are EXTREMELY SHORT, you only go in circles again, and again, is sooo boring !!The Story Mode is ALWAYS the same thing in each gameThe voices of the Characters Changed, por example, my FAVORITE character is Yoshi !! When i heard the new voice, i was shocked !is HORRIBLE......WARNING: Is boring, but not completely. Only if you play alone..."
1,BS,"This piece of crap product came scratched up and didn't work. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I love the game and needed it, but my fiance's mom runs a day care and has to keep the kids busy somehow. Only gave it 1/5 cause 0 isn't an option."
1,Not Good!!,"I was looking forward to playing this game, but when I inserted the disc in my Wii the game could not be read. I cleaned the disc good, but it still won't work. I don't recommend like new games to anyone."
1,Boring,It's just another Mario Party game. There aren't any high expectations for it. All I expect from this is a mediocre virtual board game with lousy graphics and boring sound. And that's just what Mario Party 5 is. I rate this game 37/100.
2,More of the same,"This series is really getting old. The mini game are fun , but the board game setup is soooooo slow!!!"
3,Needs more originality,"THE CONS1:no item system insted you get these dorky capsule thingys that almost never save you in a tight spot 2: Lack of originality in mini games most games are shades of games past 3:1 bowser space you got to be kidding me!THE PROS 1: it's the best party game on the market ,though disney party is fun 2:super duel mode 3:no more ""computer always win games"" (sooo many in the first 3)OVERALL: get the game for fun!"
4,"A fun game, repetitive at times...","This game is great, and it is fun to play at parties or with your family, but it would get kind of tiring if you played it often. While there are mini-games to unlock, you play many of the same ones over and over again before it randomly unlocks a new one. Maybe you should buy it used like I am going to. It is now cheaper because you can buy the new version: Mario Party 6, which looks awesome with the microphone that is included. Mario Party 5 is perfect for any level of gamer, and I especially like the fact that you can add a handicap of stars to any player. Have fun, and best of luck to the future Dream Star! (You'll know what I mean when you play the game!)"
5,Mario Party Fan,This is the most fun of all Mario Party series. It fun and it's grat entertainment for all ages! 5 stars!
4,'Feh!' on all the nay-sayers,"MP5 is a fun game, and much better than MP4, which was a mediocre follow-up to the N64 franchise. 3-D boards and the new capsule system, plus new playable characters and new board spaces, all combine to make this a great addition to my Gamecube collection. There are some really neat games, too, as well as some really bizarre ones (and one game I really hate!).Is it as great as MP1, or the best of the lot MP3? No. But if you're like me, you don't keep your N64 hooked up. MP5 is the GCN Party we needed, especially after the lame MP4 (the mushroom system ... ick!)."
3,An average game...,I say that because Mario Party 4 is better. Mario Party 4 is the best of them. But Mario Party 5 still is good!
4,Mario comes back with some new friends and fun,"I played this game and I would say it has a lot to offer. The main part of the game is pary mode where you play a bord game where you travel around and get stars and coins. You also play a mini game at the end of every turn. this is where you and the other players play a short game. There is lots to do if you get bored with pary mode. Theres is a mode I like best in this game it is called super duel mode. in super duel mode you build a car and battle other oppoents is a arena. There is also a ""pick and choose"" version of party mode called Mini game mode. you get to choose which mini game you want to play. In all ied say that Mario Party 5 is a good game that will keep kids busy for a long time."
4,Another Great Mario Party,"I just rented this game and let me tell you that it is tons of fun. With all of the new minigames that keep you coming back for more, this game is sure to get you hooked. Along with new characters and even more bizarre minigames you can change the odds with a new slew of items. But there is one flaw. The game is still to much like all of the others. That is why I didn't give it a five star rating. I mean it is fun, don't get me wrong but if you are looking for a new and different game for Christmas maybe this one isn't the right one for you. The story mode is very easy to master and takes almost no effort to complete. After you complete it there are a few new bonuses but ill leave those up to you to find. Well if you love Mario Party or just want to get in on the party action then this game is probably a must-buy. However if your looking for something different perhaps this isn't the best way to go."
4,"Worth 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars!","Hi,this is Christian Pease.I am a major Mario fan and,to be honest,THIS IS THE BEST MARIO GAME EVER!!!I have seen the awful comments of this game,and for those who hate this game,WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?THIS IS A BRILLENT GAME,AND IF YOU HATE IT,YOU BETTER TEST IT TWICE,BECAUSE I'LL SEE WHY YOU HATE IT!I'M SAYING THIS GAME IS THE BOB-OMB!(Hah!I said Bob-omb!You know, the alive bombs in the Mario world?)"
3,Come on Nintendo!,"Since I'm a very big fan of the Mario series and Mario Party series, I was very excited when this came out. I ran to the store and waste MY $50 that I saved up to buy a game. I don't think it's worth $50 at all. It's just a repeat of the last Mario Party game. Yeah, there are a few new characters and mini games, but they don't really impress me. I mean, the game boards are just getting boring. I used to play on 20 Turns. Now, I just play on 10 because I can't stand the boards. You just go in a big circle. I mean, yeah I had fun for about an hour but that's it. I probably won't touch it again.I just think that Nintendo needs to come out with something better than this. I should have waited for Mario Kart instead.."
4,coolest game on earth!,"Mario party 5 rules I love it I play story,super duel,party andmini game mode. Some of my friends cant stop playing it I amstuck in the last thing in story mode. My dad wins most of mygames and I will ask him only to help me on this part ofmario party 5. Then I will do it all over because i will notstop playing story mode until I use all the players I onlyam playing with luigi.I want to finish it."
4,Great Fun for all,"My family loves this game, true we are Mario Party addicts and love all 5 of them. The capsules are a new aspect and can be a pain, especially if you don't play competativly. I liked the customization possibilites of 4 and I wish they had left that option. The graphing of stars and coins in this is neat and can help your school aged children understand graphs in a more personal way."
4,How many will there be??,Let's see how many years ago was it when mario party first came out four or five. when it first came out it was fun and so i bought number four i never had the other ones but played it at my friends house. mario party 4 was fun and all but it gets boring after a while. nintendo needs to learn when to stop like the way they need to stop with the mario partys there getting pretty old and getting older fast.
4,It has to stop here,"I enjoyed mario party through all the games and now its just getting old. I'm not saying Mario Party 5 is bad, but the boards could have been done better. I like the minigames too, but there didn't seem to be as many. I'm just saying that Nintendo has to stop here or else its just gonna get really bad. Other things I do like about this game that makes it unique is that you can use toad, boo, and koopa kid. Its better for a change to use mario or yoshi. Overall, I give this game a 4/5 which is good, but its not what I expected it to be."
1,Just Plain BORING !,I waited and waited for this game to come out ... and was VERY sad and disappointed the game. Yes the Mini-games are fun but there is no challenge in them. The game is slow and has nothing to really work for. The stars are so easy to get it's like getting acne ! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! Buy Mario Party 4 .. its more fun !
2,WORST PARTY EVER (WARNING BAD PARTY POOPER),WORST MARIO PARTY EVER!!! ALL THE MARIO PARTY GAMES ARE THE SAME AND ALSO WHAT KINDA PARTY IS IT WITH 4 PLAYERS (MUST BE A LAME PARTY) THE MINIGAMES ARE SAME AS THE OTHER MARIO PARTY GAMES AND THEY DELETED THE BEST MINIGAMES!!! THE NINENDO GAMECUBE PLAYS BORING CLASSIC NINTENDO GAMES HELLO ITS 2004 AND ALSO THE GRAPHICS ARE CHEAP EVEN WARIOWARE INC. BEATS THIS GAME (WARIO WARE INC IS A PRETTY GOOD GAME)
4,Better than MP4,"I think that this game is fun for people of all ages. take control of one of eight characters in story mode, bonus mode, mini-game mode, and one of the other 5 modes. After that you get to play on a board (there are 6) to collect stars to win the game. between every round there is a mini-game and this is the reaql fun of the game. There are 75+ mini-games to keep you busy for hours on end. I think that you should get this if you are a gamecube owner."
