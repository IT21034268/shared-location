4,Coen Brothers Best Comedy Since The Big Lebowski,"I thought this movie was hilarous the jokes were fast and funny. People who didn't like this movie don't really no people in real life like these characters. I worked at a gym for a while and the Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand and Richard Jenkins these characters they have created really exist. Especially Brad Pitt's character the trainer clapping and pushing his clients too far. Tilda Swinton playing a cold harded b@%$* (female dog) those people exist as well. People who didn't like remeber one thing when The Big Lebowski came out almost no one liked it when it came out I loved it the first time I saw it now it is a cult classic. This could be the next cult classic so I will see you riding the bandwagon in a few years. If you like to laugh and you like good acting rent or buy this movie."
2,High Hopes Dashed...,I had such high hopes that this would be good. It was very well acted. I understand every kind of comedy. (Except British) But this only had 5 maybe 6 funny parts. And the ending was lackluster. (But I'm not entirely sure because I was half asleep then) It could have been so much better.
3,Terrible Movie,Don't buy unless you are like my wife and completely obsessed with Brad Pitt. Pitt is excellent in this movie but Clooney provies a lackluster performance that is only backed up by a shallow terribly written character.
1,"Absolutely HATED this movie, and I LOVE the Coen Bros!","This was a major waste of talent and film. I usually love the Coen Brothers, I just couldn't stand this ""black humor"" or ""dark humor"" -- whatever the buzz word of the day is. It wasn't funny. It wasn't entertaining. And it sure wasn't something I'd watch again. It left a really sour taste in my mouth after watching it. It was disturbing to say the least. Did not like it at all. Sorry. There are some who will disagree with me, and think this is hilarious, but for me.... it just didn't work. I especially thought Brad Pitt's character was a waste of screentime and what they did to him (no spoilers) was unnecessary. Wasn't funny. The whole show left you thinking... wtf? Blah."
1,Dissapointing...,"I wish I could give this review half a star. Maybe not even that. What a waste of time and a movie night. Such a boring story, and not even the least bit funnny. Four of us watched this and we all had no clue what the movie was even about, where it was going, etc... Such a talented cast of characters were wasted on this movie. No comparison to Old Country for Old Med, as the directors have done. Forget this one, anything else would be more enjoyable."
1,BURN AFTER WACTHING!!,"burn after waching is more like it. or maybe burn before watching, would be even better. there was lots of hype about this movie, most of it because of the all-star cast in the film. but a great cast or not this movie falls flat, makes the men who star at goats look like an instant classic!!"
1,not worth watching,I just wasted my time watching this movie hoping it would get better or at least give us one laugh it never was to be. I can not believe a movie with this talent could be so bad.
3,Clever But Average,"Another black comedy from the unique minds of the Coen Brothers sees a middle-aged woman trying to finance some cosmetic surgery through unorthodox methods. The plot is clever and does keep you intrigued as each of the 4 main characters are linked to keep you guessing as to the outcome. As performances go Tilda Swenton is great in the 'lead' role with George Clooney and John Malkovich also adding stellar performances. Much is made of Brad Pitt's 'idiot' portrayal, but I thought that it was just an ordinary performance and certainly nothing to rave about. Although this movie is cleverly written, it does not raise it above the level of an average film. The ending is 'sudden' and a bit of an 'anti-climax'. I enjoyed watching it, but after seeing it, it wouldn't have bothered me in the slightest if I passed this one up. Enjoyable but forgettable."
3,"""Appearances can be... deceptive.""","Every once in awhile the Coens love to throw one at you just for fun. Burn After Reading is in many ways a ""Double McGuffin,"" playing into a wide range of conspiracy theories and jaded views on life. A pair of misfits hope to extort a former CIA analyst when they stumble across a disc at a fitness club. I suppose in many ways this film is a satire of the political thrillers, set during the last days of the Bush administration when we were still living on colored alerts. The Coens draw on a wealth of talent, from John Malkovich as the disenchanted CIA analyst preparing to write a book of his experiences, to Francis McDormand who stumbles across a CD that contains much of the information he has garnered, to George Clooney as a two-timing federal marshall. Even Brad Pitt gives a stand out performance as McDormand's screwball accomplice. There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing, but this movie is played mostly for laughs."
2,Random Acts of Stupidity and Violence,"As a big fan of the Coen Brothers, George Clooney and Frances McDormand, I was expecting more from this picture than what was delivered. The whole thing comes across as one big Insider's Joke about Washington, DC, and not a funny one at that. If you live inside the Beltway, you may enjoy it, otherwise save your money."
5,Another hilarious genre spoof from the Coen Brothers,"Films by the Brothers Coen are misanthropic, yes, but when the arrogant, avaricious, duplicitous, sex-obsessed, and downright stupid schmucks they create behave so amusingly and meet such bleak ends, I can't stop laughing. Like Fargo and Raising Arizona, Burn After Reading is full of wide-eyed fools colliding with one another and with fate in endless combinations and permutations. Spy thriller meets Laurel & Hardy and riotous misadventure ensues. Give it a try with the right attitude and a cocktail and you may find yourself ROTFLYAO!"
5,Another great Cohen Bros film,"Like all Cohen Bros. work, it's the nuance and attention to detail around language and dialog that make this stand out. I love to see Clooney break out of type to some degree. The quirks and mannerisms he brings are a prefect match to subtleties of the dialog. John Malkovich also does an incredible job here. If you like the quirkier Cohen Bros movies like Fargo, The Hudsucker Proxy, and Oh Brother, Where art Thou? , you'll probably enjoy this as well."
2,Coen Do Better,This movie is piece of fluff that I'm sure was a blast to make but just doesn't come across as worth watching. Too many parts seem to have been created to give various character actors a little screen time and the result is confused and unsatisfactory. If you like the stars and anything Coen you'll probably be happy enough but they've done so much better.
2,Almost worth watching,"Now I know why this was gone in 60 seconds. You've got an amazing cast, the Coen brothers, a suitably ridiculous, over the top story...how could this not be a scream? They found a way. If you saw the trailer with Brad Pitt's wonderful mannerisms and ""I've taken this body as far as it will go"" you've seen the whole thing. I did smile a bit in spots. But laugh, no."
2,"Boring movie, disappointed in the Coen Brothers","My husband and I normally do not buy many DVDs. However, we have almost everything that the Coen brothers have done. We went to this movie with high expectations: the cast looked great, the Coen brothers are favorites, etc. It was mostly boring. So boring that we cannot believe that we wasted a night of baby sitting to sit through this. I would not buy this movie: maybe Netflix or wait for it to show up on Showtime or HBO, but do not buy it."
2,Not Up To Usual Coen Bros Standard,I love almost every thing that the Coen brothers have done but this one just didn't work for me.Unlike their other films which are clever and compelling (and often funny) this one had a half-baked thrown together feel for me.Some characters have pronounced quirks (meant to be clever no doubt) that get forgotten after a few scenes while others don't appear to have any motivation for the things they do at all.While the actors do their best their talents are wasted here.Like my subject header says; This is simply not on par with the kind of writing that we all know the Coen's are capable of.
2,Incomplete - waiting for the sequel,"First things first , brilliant acting by all. I loved Fargo and Frances M. in it and I was looking forward to seeing her again with Coen brothers' work. I wouldn't have disliked it so much if it did not end so abruptly. I seriously thought if I had hit some button accidentally. Not every movie should have a point , but this one seemed like it was headed for one. Such a waste of great great performances."
1,Burn Before Watching,"Ouch! 2 hours of my life gone, and not much to show for it. One of the few movies I have watched in recent years where I found myself looking around at the walls of my living room, trying to find something worth looking at. About 15 minutes into it, I could tell this wasn't going to be my cup of tea. And it was down-hill from there.OK, I didn't like No Country for Old Men either, so maybe it's just between me and the brothers Coen lately, although I enjoyed some of their earlier stuff. Just a little too dry, and a lot too weird/quirky for me.Anybody want a slightly used copy of this movie???"
1,less than one star,I agree with other reviewers that this movie is horrible. The story line is extremely boring and with excessive four letter words.
1,"NOT Good, NOT funny","With George Clooney & Brad Pitt & the other well known actors in this movie I figured it would be good & would be funny, as it had been said to be. I think I laughed once. For the first 30 mins or so we kept looking at our watches & wondering how long it was going to take for this movie to get going. Then it ends, the credits roll & we were thinking, ""That's 96 minutes of our lives that we can never get back."" Even for a ""black/dark"" comedy it just wasn't funny. I loved ""Oh Brother Where art thou?"". So I was expecting to like this one, but I just couldn't I couldn't even figure out what they were trying to say. The best I could figure out was they wanted to make a point of saying people in the CIA/FBI govt. type agencies are complete morons. I did some researching on line. Apparently the Coen brothers movies often are ""inside jokes"" that they & FEW other people really get."
2,Burn After Watching,"First let me say that I am a fan of many other Coen brothers movies. The only reason I could give this movie 2 stars is that there are a couple of humorous moments in the film. Otherwise this is an extremely boring, painful movie to watch as all of the characters are miserable and unlikeable. There is nothing redeeming about the film. If I wanted an empty feeling in my stomach brought about by a loss of faith in humanity I could have watched 15 minutes of Entertainment Tonight. You will not be inspired to do anything except perhaps burn the DVD and it's packaging. And that might not be a bad thing except that the toxic fumes would not be good for the environment and they might be twice as toxic as a normal DVD considering it's this film."
2,Idiotic comedy but with some funny parts.,Mostly an idiotic comedy that made little sense and was barely entertaining. A spoof of spies and spy agencies that doesn't quite make it.
2,Is there a story here?,"I found this movie utterly boring and horrible. The plot hardly barely holds itself together as the movie throws random events at you. Although listed as a comedy, there's very little to laugh at in this movie."
3,I wasn't expecting gore in this film.,"I guess I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I sat down to watch this movie..I don't know who the Coen brothers are, but all I knew was that if this movie had Brad, George and Tilda in it and it was nominated for a Golden Globe, then it was worth watching. I was very entertained by Brad's goofy character which satisfied me, but I was not expecting the gore in this film which they show a little bit. I thought it was going to be a cool comedy, not a dark comedy. I don't like bloody scenes and they snuck one in which ruined the movie for me. Do not watch this with any children around....because the scene I'm talking about is very quick and unexpected and you won't have time to cover their eyes. All in all, I liked the plot and it made me laugh."
1,Coen Brother do this?,"Listen, I've never watched a Coen brother's movie. Perhaps thats just me being dumb or it not being on my to-do list. But this movie looked funny in the trailers. So I decided to rent it, the Blockbuster guy having told me he didn't like it. I didn't believe him because 1) He was flirting with me. Never trust someone who flirts with you and you don't know them. 2)He smelled like Beef and cheese.So I get to my place and decide to watch this. Then I realize something. This movie has no plot. Wonderful actors, yes. But no plot for them to feed on. What were the writer's doing, spending a weekend in Vegas then waking up with a hangover the day the script was needed? So they took a bunch of ideas and put them together?And because of this, I don't even remember the chracters names. I know that Brad Pitt's was the funniest, even though he was too retarded to live. And Geogre clooney's guy? What is that machine? I was digusted. So my review; burn in general. Don't even bother reading"
1,Not Entertainment,"This is an irritating story of several obnoxious, self-absorbed characters who complicate each other's lives with their unscrupulous behavior. If it was intended as a ""character study"", it failed. What is does best, however, is to serve as a vehicle to showcase the enormous talent of its cast. The performances were admirable. Otherwise, the film is a complete waste."
1,makes the 3 Stooges look like geniuses,Proves conclusively that ideal casting is NOT all you need to make a good movie. All five stars are unlikeable. The shocking stupidity isn't funny. It's just shocking. If the Coens were happy with this pratfall onto a bed of nails then their funnybones have obviously been amputated.
1,The Title Is a Literal Translation of What The Actors Should Have Done When Given The Project,"The Title Is a Literal Translation of What The Actors Should Have Done When Given The Project. The movie had some high expectations for me, given I'm a huge fan of the Coen brothers and of the rat packers Clooney (Lexington born) and Pitt...unfortunately this particular movie is a horrible train wreck of plot and acting....there is no literal plot, but a mismash of events that don't even really have anything to do with one another....great disappointment. This isn't even the kind of movie you wait to catch of cable, just a waste of time."
1,This was The Coen Brothers?,"My husband and I are huge Coen brothers fans, in fact we own all of their films on DVD. We were both, frankly, shocked at how bad this movie was. The beguiling thing about a Coen character is that even though they may be ""bad"" people in society, they have some endearing human frailities that draw the viewer. Not in Burn After Reading. These folks are morally, intellectually, and emotionally bankrupt. We didn't care what happened to them if they would just leave. They are like the annoying, uninvited guest at a party that just won't go home. The only character that endears is horribly killed in the movie and that tells it all right there. Finally-the humor is just not there. Not recommended."
1,"Certainly, NOT what I expected!",The movie previews (trailers) had me under the impression that this movie was a comedy. Nothing prepared me for the excessive profanity and sexual content (the chair in George Clooney's basement). I literally gasped and sat open-mouthed after seeing the closet scene with George Clooney and Brad Pitt because I wasn't expecting it! I don't mind dark comedies if I know what I'm getting into.
2,Meh dull,Got bored after 30 minutes and stopped watching. This movie suffers from big name actors sharing the spotlight syndrome. This movie is nNot horrible but not too good either.
3,Burn After Ready,"burn after reading is a querqy dark comedy. cohen bros style.Its a good movie, with a twist or two. Not the best work by Brad Pitt and Clooney, but good enough for a watch.7 out of 10"
2,Just Fargo in DC,"This movie is little more than Fargo in DC. A collection of disfunctional, self-destructive misfits whose lives manage to cross in various ways. Thought the movie had potential, but after an hour it was clear where we were headed. We saw it all in Fargo. Did not care to see it again."
2,Coens are bit too cute in this one,Frances McDormand is worth a see but the rest of the actors you can just flush them down the commode. A bit too cute and absurd. No plot. Pointless story. Rent don't buy this one.
2,sucked,"Why force 20 words amazon?, ""sucked"" suffices. The music in the movie sucked, the acting was ok but the story was just too random and SLOW. Random doesn't equal good."
1,Burn After Reading,"I purchased this DVD thinking it was a comedy. The writers apparantly think the public needs alot ofprofanity to make it funny. I was thouroughly disgusted with the use of ""f--k. Maybe they need to expand their knowledge of funny and what's crude. If anyone would like a copy of this DVD for free, I would be happy to sent the copy I wasted good money on to them."
2,"The cover says ""A comic masterpiece"" but","Larry King is the one who said that.The only thing good about this movie is Brad Pitt's character. His actions and expressions were funny, but the rest of the film was a mess.I guess I don't really get the Coen Brothers' type of humor but it wasn't entertaining action, humor or mystery. Maybe I just don't think people are that stupid (the black mail), self-centered (Clooney's character) or that cold hearted (Tilda Swinton's character)."
3,Much better than I thought it would be.....,"Most of the hype I heard regarding this film was negative. It implied that this was not what you would expect to see from the ""Cohen Brothers"". Fortunately, the cast was so strong that I wanted to watch it in spite of the negative reviews. If you enjoyed watching their previous films, you will not regret watching this one. It is very entertaining and has the usual black humour and moments of unexpected violence. J.K. Simmons and Frances McDormand really stand out.Enjoy!!!!"
2,"No plot, no hero, no reason to watch.","It was well filmed, and had good performances, but the plot concerned a lot of unlikely people, who did not knew each other, interacting in unlikely ways. None of them were people with which you would want to spend time. There was no point, no moral lesson. It was analogous to throwing beer bottles agains a brick wall and watching pieces fly everywhere. You do not really learn anything."
2,Worst movie ever !,This movie was so slow and dry it put me to sleep multiple times. The ending was crap and the best part was Brad Pitt in the closet. I wont spoil the ending but it was a wasted cast
4,"Good, Clever Movie","We enjoyed this movie. It's funny, clever and something different. If you like the Coen Brothers, you'll enjoy. George Clooney and Brad Pitt's roles are different than anything I've ever seen; really fun. I'm ready to see it again."
2,Burn after Watching,Burn after Reading is one of those movies that is going to appear on everyone's rating radar. The movie in general was slow and difficult to really understand what was going on until half-way through. THere were unique performances by Brad Pitt and George Clooney while John Malkovich stole the show. His performance was the only reason this movie was tolerable.This movie isn't really a comedy but definately isn't what I would classify as a drama. I was expecting more from the star studded cast but overall felt the film came up short.
2,Stupid is as stupid does,"First if you are seeking goofy fun that has a point, this isn't the film. the point of the film is 'stupid does as stupid is'.I rented this film thinking it might be some witty fun film on the lighter side of 'pulp fiction' or something like that and ended up with a crappy film.I didn't like the movie 'Reservoir Dogs' for the same reason. The point is people are stupid and there is no avoiding in the film. pointless.The highlight of the film is the 'goofy' acting and personality of the characters in the film. Brad Pitts character is goofy but stupid and silly which is a slight different acting for him but again, another stupid character.if you like stupid humor then this is for you."
1,Reviewing the reviews,"Just reviewing the reviews, it sounds like I would want to BURN the movie AFTER VIEWING it."
1,Burn before viewing,"I think my title says enough. Not even worth the 1 star rating, but I had to check something. Save your time, and money. You can thank me later."
1,Burn before watching!,"Burn before watching is a more appropiate tittle, waist of my time seeing this unfunny dumb movie."
1,Not Worth the Redbox Dollar,"This movie was a disjointed, illogical, confusing crap-cluster. Virtually none of the dialogue or character motivations/actions made any kind of sense. It was basically an hour and a half of people wandering around, interacting with each other in random ways, while dropping the frequent f-bomb.Do yourself a favor at the Redbox and rent something else."
5,Hawk chasers,"I bought 2 of these owls to keep the hawks away from my baby chicks. My husband put them on tall poles and placed them in my backyard close to the chicken coop (facing the woods where the hawks usually fly out of) I think they are working because I have seen the hawks, but nowhere close to the chicks. Also, the owls' heads spin when there is a little wind. The hawks must think they are real!"
1,Instant Garden Trash,"I guess that it's no worse and probably a little better than a garden gnome. Sadly, it won't scare away birds any better than a garden gnome, either. While I haven't seen a bird sit on it, they have walked over to it to inspect it. I have tried multiple locations and the only way it will scare birds is if you throw it at them.Which may be it's best use."
1,Does not work....,"..not only does this owl not work in deterring the pesky squirrels that i see rummaging through my trash, but the very same day i put the owl up, i observed a squirrel perched on top of his head!"
2,Head falls off,Head falls off. I bought two and one came with a wind catcher to mmove the head in the wind. The other was short in the box.
1,It did not work,"Most likely the product works in other circumstances, but for sure not here in Manhattan. Pigeons continued to come undisturbed on my balcony...most likely they have no idea what an owl is!! I had to buy pigeon spikes and eventually that worked.However I have no complaint about the vendor and Amazon service, excellent."
2,Barely works,I have pigeon problem in the backyard. I put this on. It works for couple of days then they figured it out and do not scare at all. The battery died soon and I do not have energy to change the new battery and just regard it as a decoration in the yard.
1,waste of my money,This owl was a waste of money. I live on the third floor and the pigeons roost on the tall pillars where the leafy designs are. I placed the owlabout 4 feet away from them. The first day the pigeons left. I thought great I'm finally rid of them. That was it they second day they were back and haven't left since. I rate this a zero.Carolyn Marshall
3,Easy Gardener Owl,The owl was delivered in time and looks great. The head will only move if you have a lot of wind. Would not orfered another because of the movement of the head is not as easy a implied.
1,"Cute, but . . .","I was taken by the stated ""Wind-Action"" movement, but after a week in my yard, I've yet to see the head wobble or move, even in fairly strong winds! Also cheap and plastic-looking, with its paint already flaking off! Had I known all this, I certainly would not have bought it."
5,"aesthetically speaking, this is the cutest owl of the lot","aesthetically speaking, this is the cutest owl of the lotshe's kind of chubby and cuddly looking, with beautiful yellow eyes.the photo on amazon is from an unflattering angleI cannot speak as to its scarecrowing ability - i just collect owls because I like them."
1,Disappointed,"Seemed to work for about 2 days, moved it around to different locations, every few days. Then the birds stopped paying attention to it. The birds are as noisy and messy as ever."
4,Squirrel chaser,This is good in my yard because the head turns with the wind. The squirrels don't like the owl! YAY!
1,Garden Owl poor quality,"This owl looks great, but it does not operate as well as it could. The head bobbles, but does not rotate well at all. There are no instructions for use of a plastic piece that rattled around inside the owl and it is just poor quality. I guess you do get what you pay for unfortunately. I would not recommend this item. I think the seller should stop selling it due to poor quality."
2,Lazy Owl,"Purchased this owl (plus one that is stationary --Dalen OW6 16"" molded owl ) to scare off the ducks from our pool-- We did insert the small plastic piece in the back of the neck of the wind action owl, but despite moving easily when we touched it, the owl's head never budged even in high winds and storms! As others noted on Amazon, owls are not natural predators of ducks, and our pesky ducks confirmed that. The first day we put the two owls out, I looked out the window and the ducks were floating right by both of them,happy as can be. The second molded duck was hung on a pole and it twists and turns constantly in the wind, so I am keeping that for the garden pests. This one is being returned due to the lack of ""action"". I gave it a two star because it is a realistic and somewhat scary looking owl even without the movement of the head. I agree with other reviewers that the optimal owl would move it's head easily plus make noise to scare birds, squirrels, etc."
3,On the fence,"My child isn't born yet, so I cannot be an authority on how much of her advice is sound. However, as a soon to be mom, I found so much of her advice alarming or unsettling, along with other common sense advice. In particular I found the sections on breastfeeding to be the most scary- with several references to it being ""sensual"". It's hard for me to listen to anything after that word- I don't want my breastfeeding to be a sensual or sexual experience- and for someone who is nervous about breastfeeding, this book was NOT alleviating any of my fears. In fact I have shed a few tears over how much more distraught I feel after reading this book."
5,5 Stars,"Great book for new parents & also a great reference book to use post baby arrival. Use it adhoc as a guide when in a situation you need some advice on. Very easy read & really a guide to great approach with your new baby/babies. Several gf's recommended it to me & now, here I am recommending it to you!"
4,Baby Love - Good book to buy,This is a good book to read if you are a first mum. Recommended to read and obtain good counsel.
3,It grew Tiresome,"This is a hard review to write Because Im not sure anyone else is going to feel the way I feel But here goesSeason one and Season two I enjoyed a lot..... But season Three started to get on my nerves. The jokes got old I just got tired of ""Sorry About that ,"" also ""And Loving it"" and lets not forget ""Missed it by that much."" I realize these lines, some might say are part of Maxwell Smarts Charm and maybe it was when you saw the show week to week But bunched up in a DVD Collection, I find it a bit much by this third season. I think Jokes are only funny if you cant see them coming a mile awayThe plus side is There were several episodes of Kaos agent Zigfried. But another downside you get the last episode of Agent 13 (The agent in the weighing machine or Ice machine of mailbox) who was my favorite sub character. Agent 13 was in only one episode and Barbara Feldon your host said it was his last.Will I buy season Four? It will have to be a heck of a sale"
4,Get Smart Sn 3 Dvd set,"The set arrived in less than a week w/ no problems at all. All 4 dvd's played fine w/ no problems at all. This appears to be a fine vendor. It was a real treat re-visiting a hit comedy from the 1960's and good to know that the humour still works even by today's standards (however, there were more than a few dated references). The optional commentaries are a nice touch (even though Don Rickles cut his a bit short).I may consider getting the other 4 seasons of Get Smart at a later date."
4,Get Smart-- hilarious!,My kids absolutely adore this show and were thrilled when they found out I'd ordered Season 3. It definitely didn't disappoint.
5,If you like GET SMART...,It is great for people who like GET SMART humor. I like it and I think it is great.
5,Zis is Amazon. Ve do not shush here.,"These are all exceptionally well produced DVDs. Get Smart was, hands down, one of the best sit-coms of all time. Season Three may not be as funny as Seasons One or Two, but it is arguably (and only arguably) funnier than Seasons Four and Five. All five seasons are funnier than the Steve Carrel movie."
1,dirty trick,I have started collecting the real mcCoys and now have seasons 1 2 and 3. I went to see if season 4 is available yet and they have combined season 3 and 4. You can't get just season 4!! I don't want another copy of season 3!! What a dirty trick. Sure hope they don't continue to do this.
1,the real mc coys volume 3&4,"i bought this dvd thinking that i would get season 3&4 for the price of one ..... because i can buy a whole season for about 25 dollars...not so .....volume 3&4 is misleading...you only get 4 episodes plus one bonus episode that i can not get to play....i was so frustrated,because it was used and it cost me 18 dollars plus to get just 4 episodes... what a rip off..... don't buy it!!!! i don't think it is worth it.....rather buy the whole season ...you get much more for your money....i do not think, that i would have paid more than 5 dollars for only 4 episodes!!!!!"
3,"Not exactly as shown, but nice","The jump rope is not the same as the photo, nor is the hand wrap (comes with ones that look like ACE bandages that take forever to wrap). And the jumprope is not easily adjusted, so I am going to buy a nicer one. Also, the gloves that come with it have already started to come apart after only a week. The bag is very nice though. I would recommend buying the bag separately and saving some $$$ and buy the other stuff separate."
5,good all-around set,"I bought this set for my 14 year old son 2 years ago, it is still in nice shape and has given many hours of fun for all those hanging out in my garage."
4,"Decent movie, bad DVD","Okay, look, this is not great cinema. The story just doesn't support greatness. You can't make Shakespeare out of Superman.Visually, it's stunning, and on that basis I give it four stars; that, and the scenery-chewing by all the stars, notably Samuel L Jackson (well, duh), make for splendid entertainment.No, I dinged it for the lousy content. Widescreen and standard on one disc (standard is SO out of here) and theatrical trailers; and that's it.Are you kidding me? No deleted scenes? No 'Making Of'...? No Spirit Comics overview? No commentary track? No NOTHIN'? In 2009?Somebody oughta get smacked.For what we get, we should've been charged less."
1,What a waste.,"First off I want to say that I usually give movies the benifit of the doubt and I am normally not too harsh on movies. After stating this I must say that this movie is the perfect example of waisted talent and effort. The movie had a great cast of actors who gave the most awful performances of their careers. At no time was the story even interesting. Seeing that the effects are parrallel to Sin City, I thought this movie had to have some quality to it. This movie is the G rated version of Sin City. The special effects are totally waisted by a bad script and performances. I was warned that this was not a good movie, but this movie truly owes its audience an apology."
1,What Happened Frank?,"When I saw this movie I was expecting Frank Miller to make his version of the Spirit. I'd like to read what creator Will Eisner thought about this film. For me, I was expecting a plot. The Spirit of the comics had much more depth and integrity. This one was just a lot of computer special effects tied together with no story whatsoever. The movie didn't work for me on any level. Miller attempted to make it campy like the old Batman TV series of the sixties. It doesn't work! If I find this in the 5 dollar bin at Wal Mart I may buy it. However it's not the $14.95 or $19.99 that retail stores will charge for this."
3,"Visually striking, a little flawed","""The Spirit"" works as eye candy, and doesn't pretend to be anything but. After the first confrontation between The Spirit and the Octopus, it sets the tone that it won't take itself too seriously, and violence will be an overwhelming theme. It's like a PG-13 movie with R violence. It's corny a bunch of times, and a very quotable Sam Jackson saying, ""I DO NOT LIKE EGG ON MY FACE."" It's a fun romp, if you go in with an open mind. It's really not as bad as the reviews say it is. It certainly isn't Sin City, but it's still watchable."
1,Incredible Waste of Time,"I enjoyed Sin City for the well thought out and artistically entwined stories. The comic book styling was also very cool.I was hoping for more of the same with ""Spirit"".I can't imagine how the director of this film was able to get funding to produce this garbage.He must have had something on someone...A pathetic attempt at entertainment."
1,Will Eisner is spinning in his grave,"It is ironic that Frank Miller has won the Eisner award several times and considers Will Eisner his role model and mentor. This incomprehensible submission is an insult to the genre and to his memory.The success of the adaption of Sin City gave Miller some creds to direct his own film (Robert Rodriguez gave him screen credit for directing one of the vignettes) - but what worked for Sin City is not applicable to The Spirit, and implies that Miller is a One Trick Pony. What I recall of the Spirit is the wonderful primary colors - the blue suit, the red tie, the piercing blue eyes of Denny Colt. At the end of the film, I could not decide if I'd watched a satire, a comedy or a poorly presented drama. Probably a bit of all three. It was advertised as an 'homage' to Will Eisner, but it was more of an insult. Frank Miller is a brilliant writer and ground breaking cartoonist, but his skill as a film director is lacking."
3,Funnyl lame story,"So many mention Sin City when The Spirit is mentioned. By no means is this anywhere near to Sin City. The Spirit is smilar to some other movies, the villan enrgiez the show. Samuel L Jackson gave the Octopus enrgy that made you laugh just when it would get lame. Glad I didn't go to the movies to see it but it is a good thing to watch on a rainy day or you're under the weather. Some people are meant to direct and some are meant to write and produce. Miller didn't do Eisner's work good."
5,Customer Reviewit,"The Spirit was just like Sun City. It arrived on time, and I was very please with the purchase. It ran perfectly well, no damages or anything. It was in excellent condition"
1,WHAT A JOKE,"I'm a long-time fan of Will Eisner's Spirit, so, even though I had been warned, I just had to see for myself. This piece of crap has nothing in common with the original, except the name. Frank Miller is one of the most overrated s.o.b.s in the world. He should be ashamed to do this to one of the comics' greatest characters. A total waste of time; I couldn't sit through it. Save your money. It's not even worth renting. If you (like I!) just HAVE to see for yourself, pick it up at a local library. At least that way you'll only waste your time, not time and money both."
2,Disapointing...,"I am a fan of Frank Miller. I have enjoyed his other movies, Sin City and 300. I absolutely enjoyed those two movies because they delivered and were both very enjoyable.The Spirt. Not so much. As a fan of Frank Miller I enjoyed the visual effects and the story line. I enjoyed the vivid colors and the story line. But for him delivering two action packed, drama infused movies previously - The Spirit did not fire on all pistons. It was in a simple word - disapointing."
1,The Movie that people on Ecstasy Hate,"Frank Miller hated what they did to his ""300"" so he decided that it would be fair to screw up someone else's vision. Good job, Frankie. This is the worst film I've ever seen in my life! You've gone where no man has dared go before."
2,"Really, really bad","The Bottom Line:Frank Miller clearly learned nothing from Robert Rodriguez, for this leaden and awful comic book film shows nothing of the tongue-in-cheek flair of Sin City: I was the only person in my family who wanted to see this film when it came out and they all thought I was stupid--upon finally seeing it (alone) I realized they were all right.1.5/4"
2,The Kobayashi Report,Though I did indent to watch it when I got it I end up not watching it and then giving it away. So whatever I say here really shouldn't sound for anything. I never found it interesting.
1,Terrible movie!,"I really enjoyed 300 and Sin City but this movie was just plain terrible.The acting was terrible. Plot was terrible. Cinematography was terrible.It was a shame that you have good actors (Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson) appearing in this terrible movie.Please save yourselves even the cost of rental. It will be a sad waste of your time and money."
1,One star might be too high a rating,"The Spirit will go down as the worst movie I've seen this decade. I've liked almost all the comic book/graphic novel inspired movies until this dog showed up. If the spirit moves you to see/buy/rent this movie, resist the temptation. Just say no!"
1,Lame movie,"this came out in the theater? should have been direct to video. lame story, lame charectors. is this suppose to be a comedy? I couldn't even watch it all, makes batman & robin look like a master piece, yea its that bad."
2,This movie was pretty.....terrible,"I saw this movie in theaters on Christmas day and I was excited to see it, but was dissapointed more and more as we went along.A lot of things didnt make sense, I didnt care for the villians, and the ending was just so terrible....Save yourselves the time and dont watch this movie."
4,Sin City Lite,"I have no idea who The Spirit is. I've never seen comics for the guy but this movie did look damn good. I'll try something new with my reviews and try to go with pros and cons to the filmPros-Eve Mendes and Scarlett Johnansson were smoking hot and Samuel L Jackson did a decent job as The Octopuss but it's the same old shtick for him.It was Sin City but only tamer.Gabriel Macht did do a good job as The Spirit. The only acting I felt weak was those stupid bad guys.Cons-PG-13 really hurt the film. A good PG-13 can contain a few curse words and some great action, this film lacked both.Alot of weird stuff going on that make you go huhOverall, i'd diffently welcome a sequel but that probably will never happen. This rarely ran in theaters and I dont think many people know it exist. If you do see a copy of the film in a bargain bin within a year, I'd check it out."
2,Stupid 90% of the time. Best feature: Eva Mendes.,"You have to dive deep into suspension of disbelieve waters if you want to enjoy this thing. I believe Frank Miller wanted to issue this film at least R-rated instead of PG-13. Who knows? Perhaps studio executives insisted in a PG-13. Otherwise why blurring Eva Mendes nude (and sooo brief) scene? She is a goddess and I don't see anything wrong in worshipping her beauty. Besides, she's a very good actress. However, this is America and frontal nudity must be forbidden. Otherwise we may find it attractive and become perverted by the devil.In any case, at times the movie almost makes sense. The excessive violence of the fighting sequences may shock some people, until it's understood that the charcters really don't suffer that much.Acting is not bad, but something went wrong somewhere with the movie. It could have been good Frank Miller. Instead is awful Frank Miller."
1,DONT BUY THIS SPECIAL EDITION!,"total rip-off. the second disc is the digital copy, which upon dropping in you pc does nothing more than link you to itunes and then prompt you to enter the code and download your movie...what a waste!if i knew this i would have bought the regular version.there are free dvd ripping progs out there. just gotta look, and they work great!otherwise, i really enjoy this movie! its got action. its corny as hell, but hey, its a comic. its entertainment!"
2,Meh,"This would have been a one star film were it not for two points. 1 The amazing cinematography style and 2 Samuel's amazing acting. His awesome acting in this film makes it worth one watch, but the terrible ""plot"" and the lack of character for anyone else makes worth no more."
4,Something diffirent,"Never seen this movie, intell about week ago. Interesting, to try, see something diffirent. Its about man call ""The Spirit"" with an obsession to catch ""The Octopus."" Who was play by Samuel L. Jackson. A masked avenger who stops any crime, wows the ladies. Like I said something diffirent."
4,"""The Spirit"" Has Some","A fifties era feel to this comic master piece. If you don't enjoy this genre of film, as my wife for example, you may still like this one. I you liked ""Sin City"" then you'll like this one. It's good fun."
1,I liked this movie,"Ok. So you're going to ask yourself ""Why does he say he likes this movie if he only gave it one star?"" -- My answer is that I liked it, but I simply can't recommend it. The film is an unqualified mess, plot-wise. It makes no sense what-so-ever.Unless you are able to get over this major, MAJOR flaw and enjoy it only for its visuals, you should stay far FAR away from this film!"
4,"I liked it, AND it made sense.....","The plot has ties to mythology, which isn't uncommon for old school comic books (or, in this case, movies based on them). Some of Miller's choices for visuals may leave one pondering, but it's a great movie for comic book fans and those who just wanna have some popcorn and see something fresh."
3,Tried to be Sin City. Not quite there.,"Has a certain feel beyond the norm,if you're into that, which I am. More campy than Sin City and not as well done. But, alas, it grows on you a bit. If you like Samuel Jackson acting silly, see it."
1,Stank Miller,"I don't know who let Frank Miller direct a film about the Spirit ( a groundbreaking comic strip created by legendary cartoonist Will Eisner...) but it was the epitome of a mistake. I am a huge fan of Miller's earlier work as a writer/artist in the comics genre but, I can't understand what has happened to this once bright light in American pop culture. His work has been steadily getting more and more hackneyed since the sequel to THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS. I found this ""film"" a travesty and an insult to Eisner's innovative work. :-( Really Bad. I wish we could give less than one star."
5,First Rate Drama,"The Last Detective series involves real life situations which keep you on the edge of your seat. The acting and production values are first rate.There is none of the typical ""formula"" that many detective series seem to be hampered with. There is a balance of violence to heart felt human emotions and even when the endings are not resolved always satifactory, there again, it is like real life. Not all of life's problems and situations are wrapped up with a neat ribbon. You are able to experiece the drama of looking in at what is happening around Detective Dangerous, the good the bad and the ugly. Peter Davison, as Detective Dangerous is someone we can identify with for his humanity, humor, and his ability to handle his life in the police force,while holding on to his integrity. He is someone we root for and admire."
5,A very satisfying series ...,"Detective Constable ""Dangerous"" Davies, played with brilliant understatement by Peter Davison, is perhaps the british equivalent of America's ""Columbo"". Disrespected by most, particularly his colleagues, Davies is a downright effective detective. I suppose Davies' biggest problem, at least as relates to workplace advancement and marital harmony, is his innate kindness. He is very thoughtful, compassionate and tolerant towards all, perhaps too much so. His impatient and frankly unfaithful wife (who doesn't deserve him), finds him lacking in the excitement department. His quirky chum Mod, although charming, takes Davies for granted. Davies' often boorish police colleagues mistake his quiet demeanor for lack of skill. It is refreshing to see such a laid-back yet successful (at least in terms of solving cases) law enforcement officer. An enormously unique and satisfying series."
4,The Last Detective series 4,"an extremely satisfying series. Peter Davison has really made the role his own and the viewer is constantly pulling for him. The difference between his mild manner (""Dangerous's"" default mode) and his intense, you've-pushed-me too-far attitude is striking and worth the wait. I hope the series goes on."
5,Replacement catridge for laserJet,I highly recommend this replacement cartridge. It is working very well in my Laser printer. It is reasonably priceand performs admirably.
4,drop in replacement,Dropped right in. No mailing label to recycle the old one though. more empty words to please review entry box.
3,Did you notice? It's a reman.,"I'm reading the official description of this item, right off the screen -- ""Verbatim EP-VX Toner Cart for HP LaserJet 5P/5MP/6P/6MP (1-Pack)"".Sounds like a new Verbatim cart, right? No. It's a reman. In its first life, it was a new Verbatim, but now it's a reman. When I received it I immediately suspected it wasn't new Verbatim -- not in a Verbatim box. I opened it anyway. I compared it to my exhausted but genuine Verbatim cart -- same appearance, but the Verbatim stickers have been peeled off.I went back to Amazon and took a close look -- yes, buried in the fine print it says it's a reman. But clearly, our seller is pushing the edge and carefully avoiding saying it's a reman in the larger print.Does it work? Yes, it's fine. That's not the point. The point is that this item is only just barely inside the line for accurately described."
5,cat naps- perfect cat book,i got one for gift- so i had to get another for cat friendswill order more also- its such a nice book to keep on desk.
5,Cutest book ever!,A must for cat lovers! It was a great stocking stuffer and would make a great gift anytime. A friend had the book and I couldn't resist.
4,cd roms are helpful,The CD-rom series that you can buy as a bundle is the way to go. The cd's put the steps in the book into real time. The CDs make everything easier to visualize.
4,"""Just what the Dr. (Professor) ordered!""","This book has all the basic skills necessary for Nursing students from LPN's to RN's. Excellent resource material also for individuals who are already LPN's and RN's. As a Paramedic some of the contents are conflicting with what I have already been taught but not off tangent too much. I have found this conflict in many separate medical related books such as Paramedics, EMT's and Nursing literatures. The Amazon site is the best site to find various books to check on learning. This is an amazing book for aspiring Nursing students. Thanks"
3,A bit cheap - but works just fine,It's a bit cheap in construction but what do you expect - its cheap and I won't plan on using it every day
4,"Does the intended job, solid construction, but...","Exactly as described, high quality metal and fittings. The one problem I have is that it should have some way to tight a string/rope/chain on it so it can be secured to something and not walk away. Or to be hung from a peg board. It will easily be lost/stolen in no time at all and it is not something you would simply leave on an outdoor faucet because it will fall right off into the nearby vegetation. I may drill a hole though on of the sides that I do not need to accomplish this missing functionality."
5,Great Brahms playing in a gentle mood,"I agree with the reviewer below who calls these Menuhin-led performances inspiring. The two Brahms Sextets have been fortunate on recordings, with great accounts going back to the Casals Festival in the early Fifties. If you own the live readings by the combined Amadeus and Alban Berg Quartets, you know how great the older recordings are. But Menuhin and his friends, all notable soloists and free lancers in London during the Sixties, seem the most tender and sweet-toned of all.They don't underplay, and at all times the rhythm never flags. It's a matter of sympathetic consensus and a high level of musicality. Since this CD can be had for a song at Amazon Marketplace, I don't see how any lover of these pieces could pass it up. The sound is a bit edgy and thin at loud volume, but that's the only caveat. It should also be said, I suppose, that Menuhin misses the pitch here and there, but not to a distressing degree."
4,cellopower,"This is a lovely recording, capturing Brahms' genius for weaving a texture in which the individual instruments rise to prominence and fall away in quick succession. My only complaint is that the quality of the sound suffers some, I'm sure due to the limited recording technology of the early 1960's. It definitely inspires my approach to the music when I play it myself."
5,great recording of the Brahms Sextets,"wonderful analog era recording. the musicianship is top rate. Maurice Gendron is a superlative cellist. He has to be heard more often (postumously, of course)."
1,"Don't Bother ordering from ""Best Service Stores""","Don't Bother ordering from ""Best Service Stores"" they do not have the item in stock and will just cancel your order."
3,Skip this one...,"I bought this book on a recommendation, but I wish I hadn't. I tried to use it for an advanced graduate course in Lie groups, but it was not suitable. The books is essentially a list of theorems, with little or no discussion and few examples. At points there seem to be typos in it, or at least lack of clarity.It is alright as a reference book, but no one should have to use it to learn about Lie groups."
4,Inhmanoids,"For anyone who is a fan of the animation of the 80's, like G.I. Joe or The Transformers, this is a must have. Its been years since this movie has been avliable on VHS and I couldn't e more excited about this re-release. The story centers on a classic good-vs-evil motif, but its lively and creative characters make it really interesting. First the is the heroic human group 'Earth Corps', who inadvertantly free and subsequently are inlisted to help recapture the inhumanoids; a subterranean group of titanic monsters. The demon-like trio of Inhumanoids includes Decompose; a skeletal beast, Tedril; a plant creature, and Metlar; a metal-scaled monster whose volcanic core is filled with molten lava!!! In this exciting adventure the Earth Corps must face the danger of the Inhumanoids and survive an encounter with the mysterious Mutores, another subterranean group of creatures who might be either friends, or foes. So for fans of colorful animation of the 80's, look no further."
3,"Nice idea, needed better budget.","The cartoon is a fun and interesting idea that was ahead of its time wrapped in a low budge poorly handled package.The voice acting make my laugh, the animation is fair at its best to jerky and bad looking and the story line has several obvious holes in it.However,The monsters frightening to imagine and pretty unstoppable and treated that way all the way till the end."
2,Inhum-ANOID-s (@FEW EPSDS ONLY!),"HEY,HOW'S IT GOING? This series was pretty good for it's time. Action meets Horror with monsters and all. The quality of this show is pretty decent, although I wished they could bring this out in a COMPLETE SERIES DVDBoxset form, (maybe REMASTERED DVDSET?)reason being this only has the first 5Epsds, the origins of the four characters and how they stumbled upon this race of wood creatures(amongst others)that have been battling these monsters and IMPRISONED THEM, since before the human race. It's still good to watch though, but there are no extras or special features whatsoever,it's only the FIVE episodes and THAT'S IT. Which is WHY? I'm only giving it 2STARS. Gotta say though the animation IS STILL PRETTY COOL!"
2,cartoon or infomertial?,I almost regret wating my money on this. I can see it's nothing more than a product seller trying to sell their product. I don't even think this is on TV anymore.
2,Uninspired performances,"Moniuszko's most famous operas, Halka and The Haunted Manor still retain places at the fringe of the repertoire (especially in Poland), and they are truly fine works, displaying strong melodic gifts and a fine ear for structure and instrumentation, and the results are often delightful, atmospheric music. A disc of overtures from mostly less famous operas should thus be very welcome. Unfortunatly, this disc doesn't really represent the pieces in the best possible light, since the performances are lacking severely in fire and excitement. In short, these are dull, plain run-throughs with little verve or vitality and in particular lacking in terms of dramatic contrasts. I have not heard the alternative older disc by Fitelberg and Rowicki, but I strongly suspect that it is vastly preferable to CPO's effort here. Sound quality is fine, for all its worth."
4,More of a Good Thing,"Two or three previous reviewers have already dissected the contents of this disc, and so there's no need for me to reinvent their wheels. Let me just restate the fact that this is a follow-up album to a previous release that compiled a number of variations on the traditional European tune La Folia. Casual listeners should understand, then, that many selections will therefore ""sound the same."" For those of us who enjoy that sort of thing, particularly with this piece, that's a given, and in this case a most welcome given. Savall and his forces render the music exquisitely as always, and I'm quite happy to have yet another album offering Folia variations. Your mileage may vary, however, depending on how much mileage you care to try to get from one melody. I'm fine with it, but you might wish to have either this or its companion disc rather than take the full round trip."
4,Good early music,"This is good early music. I especially like the first couple of tracks and the tracks with percussion. There are a couple of tracks later on in the album that get a little dull and repetitive with too much harpsichord, but overall the album is a good one and worth having."
5,Don't Buy This- You Can Get It for Free!,"This fine piece of work was produced by the Congressional Research Service, part of the U.S. government. Anyone who wants a copy of it can get it FREE by calling or writing your representative or senator. There's no need to buy it. This is just a reproduction of a public domain document by some private company."
5,Prophetic and correct.,"I read this book here in Brazil.Even being an (unemployed) agronomist, I love to read books about military affairs.This book is the best about this subject, I ever read until today.Being writen in 1997, this book had a prophecy writen on page 5:""For the first time in history the American ""home front"" will become highly vulnerable and will become the target of enemy attack.This attack will materialize in many forms.Terrorists will almost certainly target American cities, launching sudden, unexpected strikes against the dense target population they offer"".A great prophecy.A fault of this book is his paper.A paper of bad quality.A paper for newspaper, not for books.At second this book focus in Comanche helicopter and other military sistems , who were cut , by american military planners some years ago."
2,Tech info for non-techies,"First of all, this book is NOT well written. Sentences such as the following abound throughout the text: ""In the next chapter we will examine some of the best guesstimates about the flashpoints that may ignite the tinderbox of geopolitics into the bonfire of Mars, and thereby bring about tomorrow's war."" Give me a break. Second, the politics in the chapters about ""flashpoints"" shows a limited understanding of international politics and relations. Third, if you are looking for a quick way to find out about some of the technological advances which are changing warfare, and don't already know much about it, then this book is useful as a primer. You're better off reading Jane's Defence Weekly and Defense News, however."
4,Wondering about the quality of these live tracks?,"Most Tori fans will consider getting this disc for 3 reasons: (1) To get the video (2) To get the remix of Concertina (3) To get the live tracks The video is not one of my favorites, but likely the only way you will get to see it, so if you are as curious as I was, naturally this is a good thing to get. The remix of Concertina is not particularly interesting. The song sounds a bit broken with the extra vocals added in, although in some places it sounds fantastic. The live tracks are really the reason why I think the single is worth having (for those of us who don't just collect them all). Both are very well done and superior to the studio versions of these songs with which we are all familiar. I was not even fond of either song until this revelation. I highly recommend these tracks."
4,Beautiful,"I'm really happy that Tori decided to release Concertina has her next single. The new edit of it is beautiful and the Glory of the 80's video on the cd is a wonderful addition! Considering no one will play her videos. The only problem I have is not to see newer b-sides on this cd. The same live tracks from the Glory of the 80's single were used. Usually Tori has tons of b-sides on her singles. But, overall I recommend this for true Tori fans and collectors of her cds."
2,Bought this for the video access ...,"and it won't work - either on my PC or Mac. When I was *finally* able to get it installed on my PC and got to the screen to view the video, the site (atlantic records) says it is not available. no searching the atlantic site for it. nada. very disappointed. the cd is good - but the video was my real goal and it appears to be a dud in that respect. sad."
5,Concertina-Tori Amos,"Single from the double disc To Venus And Back, Concertina is truly spellbinding. This live version is even better. While ""Concertina"" is a must hear for fans and casual listeners,""Famous Blue Raincoat"" and ""Twinkle"" may take time to hook potential Tori Philes. Kudos just the same."
5,Wonderful Single,"Concertina is a great single to own. There's a great remix which in my opinion is better than the album track. Famous Blue Raincoat is one of those songs where Tori just shines. And I agree with the person who said she breathed new life into the song Twinkle, something that was missing from Pele's version. This is a must have for fans."
4,"""Famous Blue Raincoat"" Shines","Certainly not the best Tori maxi-single. The ""Concertina"" remix isn't anything particulary outstanding, nor is the emotionally watered-down live version of ""Twinkle"". However, what makes this CD a worthwhile purchase is Tori's beautifully vocalized live cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Famous Blue Raincoat"". I can't tell you how many times I've listened to this track over and over again...and it still leaves me breathless."
3,Doesn't live up to the title,"Not a bad book at all. In fact, it contains some truly iconic photographs. It also contains a lot of mundane photographs, and as a result doesn't really live up to the title of the book. I agree with the oldest review (May 1999) below -- too many rather bland photos (and yes, almost all are black-and-white)."
4,targets,"They were great targets but they came shipped and crushed and wrinkled, and the quanity was small, they had fun with them."
3,OK target but not my favorite,Since this is a normal paper target it's a bit harder to see the bullet holes. Price is good but isn't a target I would likely get again.
3,Israel defeats Egypt in the Sinai in 1956.,"Marshall is an Army historian who has written several good books about America's battles in WWI and Korea. In this book, he writes about Israel's small army taking on the Egyptians during the Suez crisis. The Israeli Army manages to take over the Sinai from the Egyptians. In the book, a heroic Ariel Sharon makes his appearance in one of the central battles for control of the Sinai. All of the battles are covered in this 100 hour war. Marshall details the tactics the Israeli Army used in defeating the Egyptians. Also covered is how the Israeli Army is made up, the training required, and the role of women.What is not covered in this book is the Egyptian perspective, and what the effects of the war were. This angle was not covered, and one wonders what the reader is missing from this perspective. I have read more thrilling combat history than that covered in this book."
1,Deceptive Ad,"This listing offers the 3.4 ounce size in either splash or spray from One Stop Perfume. Upon receiving it- and discovering that it is the 1.7 ounce, I came back and checked the listing. It does say ""1.7 ounces"" in the ""fine print"" of the description. So Buyer Beware.At this rate, it would have been cheaper- and certainly less hassle, just to order it from Neiman's.I'm not sure if it is Amazon's error or One Stop Perfume, but I won't ever order from this company again."
1,Buyer beware,"I bought the 1.7 ounce bottle of Eau D'haridien, from Scentiments.The bottle was not as in the photo, but a squarish one, and the printingon the label seemed suspicious. The smell is not at all the same asthe sample I have, and is unpleasant. I am almost certain it is a copy.Next time I plan to buy it at Anthropologie."
4,Great Bargain,"Product arrived quickly and well packed. Perfumania even threw in a surprise sample of another product but, unfortunately, it was for a man's cologne, which wasn't useful in my household.Despite much reduced price [as compared to Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus for same product], I believe the product is genuine and it is serving well as my summer fragrance."
4,My favorite perfume,"This is my favorite perfume, so there is nothing for me to dislike about it except the price! The usual, classic container."
2,Nothing Stands Out,"This CD as a whole does not captivate my attention. After receiving it and taking a listen, I got out of my chair and started doing other things around the house while the CD was playing. The song ""Everything You Need"" is not bad but the rest of the songs, I could live without."
2,Purchase the 2nd Edition!,I didn't realize I purchased the first edition for my qualititative methods course until the in-class discussion of the first reading assignment. It was clear the 1st edition was lacking. I had to go and buy the 2nd edition because there was so much excellent material added in the 2nd edition and I couldn't get by without it. I would DEFINITELY recommend the 2nd edition.
5,This guy will be a star,"I bought this CD and love it. My kids especially listen to it and love ""Hugs and Kisses"". You should buy this album. We can't wait for his next album!!!"
2,This book has several mistakes which need to be reviewed,"Tis book has a good base however I strongly recomend that the authors need to actually read this book over, and correct the multitude of mistakes that have been made in this publication."
3,Does the job,Does the job but readers will want to be aware that this manual is about the engine only - 90% of the mechanics and electrics.just Jack
3,still not sure,book is old school does not really ex plane to much on stuff fluid types and levels parts list really not straight forward
3,Mercruiser stern drive review,"It appears everything is there, but it is challenging to find it, the index is very weak. Drawings are good, but no pictures."
3,"Mercruiser: Stern Drive Shop Manual 1986-1994 : Alpha One, Bravo One, Bravo Two & Bravo Three","Well written with fine hand-drawn & photo graphics. Too many models covered in the book so that my section was only ten percent of this big volume, but the information was badly needed and most helpful...."
4,Good Album,"'That's The Way My Heart Goes' (upbeat dance song...probably the most instantly catchy on the disc; has a very stilted rhythm and sing-song chorus that is very sexy), 'Beyond Tonight' (moody syth-piano love/ sad song that is very atmospheric), 'I Love Making Love In The Morning' (has a very eighties ""I swear they sampled Culture Club's Karma Chameleon"" kind of feel; This is a song that makes you feel good about being in a relationship), 'Boy I Used To Know' (a very girl empowerment kind of song; harmless, meaningless pop). The rest of the CD is good, but nothing you couldn't live without."
1,Save your money,I actually liked A-teens and their bubblegum pop.But this album is so bad it hurts!!
2,Well...,"A lonely housewife unknowingly has a one nighter with her best friend's killer. Obsession, stalking and death ensue. Before you can say that's all there is, that's pretty much all there really is. Standard story lines apply: adulterer's guilt and fear, spouse's anger and disbelief, killer's mother fixation, etc, etc (you get the idea). Lead performances range from decent enough (Corbin Bernsen, Claudia Christian) to over the top (Nicholas Celozzi, or I should say `over kill' since he plays the killer). TV B movie quality. Ron Perlman has a small role as a Detective and gives his character some nice quirks (it wouldn't surprise me if they weren't scripted and he did them simply to entertain himself). Buy it cheap for one of those on hand ""rainy day"" movies."
2,Fairly good up until the very end.,"This is a pretty good mid-budget film about a married woman played by Claudia Christian who has an affair with a looney-tune. She suspects that not only is the crazy-man is stalking her but that he has been killing other women. Ron ""Hellboy"" Pearlman shows up as the detective investigating the murders.The movie is fairly interesting and has an interesting cast: Corbin Bernsen as the husband and Dick Van Patten (remember ""8 is Enough""?) as the family friend. But then the movie commits hari-kiri at the end in a way that makes the whole exercise a waste of time. Too bad.At least Claudia C. looks really good in this film."
2,Ground and Pound returns to haunt us,This show has lots of my favourite fighters but it is not as stellar as RETURN OF THE WARRIORS or BATTLE OF THE RISING SUN but PRIDE FC always puts on a better show than the clowns at your local YMCA could. Newton vs Sani is impressive ... also the Vernon White v Alan Goes match is pretty exciting but there are better PRIDEs you can buy. Even the Gilbert Yvel v Vitor match turns unfortunately dull....ground and pound...BORING!!!!!!!!!! Your money is better spent on either of the two Pride's I mentioned earlier...but thats just what I reckon.
3,"Good, but not great","This guidebook covers Switzerland from a British point of view. The Rough Guide series is not known for it's in depth coverage. The entries in this guide tend to be brief--only giving a mention and a list of business hours and transportation info. For those who are looking for more in depth coverage, this obituaries style of writing may leave you looking for something else. If you cut out the phone numbers, lists of business hours, and transportation information, then the page count would be cut in half. Also, for a book that spends so much time talking about transportation, it's a little frustrating that there aren't more maps to illustrate the directions. If you're looking for a comprehensive guidebook for Switzerland, I would get another guidebook."
2,Shrunk badly,"When I first recieved these sheets I was so happy because they felt so smooth, thick and luxurious. Unfortunately the top sheet has shrunk so badly that it can not be tucked in on either side. As I live in a hot climate this is not such a problem for me however in a cold dlimate I would find it very uncomfortable and the sheets useless. I have always washed them in cold water and then put them in the dryer as per instructions"
2,Not your typical luxury sheets,Sheets are very thick and have made in China tag. I have only had them one week and already notice the sheets are pilling (little balls building up). One side of the sheet is soft other side is like sand paper and scratchy. Not your typical luxury sheets and will not buy a set like these again.
3,fair to middling sheets,"as others have made comment, the sheets are very stiff and heavy. we did not at all get the feeling of luxury as stated in the ad hype. were they worth 80 bucks?, yeah but very borderline.we also bght the 500tc sheets and found them more to our liking. and, at half the price..."
1,They pilled.,"I was so excited to get these sheets. I even ordered an extra set as a gift. Well, they will be going back because they pilled the first time on the bed.Yuch!!!"
4,"nice, but not the softest",The sheets look nice and are of substantial weight. They fit my bed well and haven't shrunk so fall after a few washings. They are not as soft though as some lower thread count sheets I bought from Amazon for $20 on sale.
1,Do Not Buy,I read all the reviews and took a chance anyways and I really wish I hadn't. After washing these sheets just a few times in warm (not hot) water they are pilling and scratching my skin.
2,Don't be fooled by the high thread count,"I ordered these sheets because I thought they would be really soft with the high thread count. They aren't. I purchased much less expensive sheets with a lower thread count at a local discount store and like them a lot better than these. These sheets fit well and are nice sheets, but they aren't very soft. Would not buy them again. Wish I hadn't washed them so I could return them."
2,Great... till they wore out,Have only had these sheets for about 5 months and they have worn out and gotten scratchy where I sleep. Dissapointed.
2,Smelled as strongly as gasoline,"These sheets seem to be of variable quality. Some people love them, a few had complained of a smell. I figured it would wash out. Well, this odor was not just your regular ""sizing"" smell: it was a very strong industrial solvent type of smell that made your sinuses burn. Not something I had ever smelled on clothing or bedding. I had to wash the sheets 4 times in a row before using. But... even another series of washes after that, every time I slept on them, I woke up with irritated sinuses. It's just not *normal* that you should have to deal with toxicity in your bed, and certainly not from ""luxury"" sheets. I ended up tossing them out.Otherwise, they were fine, but prone to wrinkles, and definitely not worth the hassle."
2,"Happy then, but not now","I wrote a 5 star rating just after I received these 1000 tc sheets. They were soft and very comfortable. But now, 3 1/2 months later, I awoke with n 8"" tear in the fitted sheet. That was a big disappointment. I expected better."
4,Great value,This is a great value for the price. My daughter was so happy to receive it at Christmas. The only problem is the top sheet is shorter than it should be.
2,Do not feel like 1000 TC sheets,"I read other reviews and thought that they were being critical about this product, but they were right on: these sheets suck! I have a 800 TC sateen set and they feel much softer than these. These are good sheets if you need 1 night of sheets while washing another set."
3,Hope will get better,"This is the first time I purchased sheets of 1000 tc. I expected it to be very soft. However, they are very stiff compared to my 400tc sheets. I am guessing perhaps when people say these sheets are ""soft"", they mean they are ""smooth."" I am still breaking in. Reading reviews from other people helped and gave me hope. I am looking forward to washing them several more times and see if they feel softer."
2,They're already pilled,"First of all, if they're 1000 count sheets, they're made of really thin threads. They're not anything near the thickness of the 1000 thread sheets I'm replacing that my dog tore up (ouch). Just out of the package they were pretty nice sheets, but I've had them just shy of two months and they're already so pilled up on the sleeping area of the bottom sheet that they look like flannel. I doubt these sheets will last over 6 months. A waste of money."
2,Balls keep forming on these sheets,"When I got these sheets and I slept on them the 1st few times I loved them... Until I washed them (on a regular washing machine, warm water setting). Small but very perceptible balls formed on the sheets and they were not soft anymore. I like that they're thick as I would expect of 1000 Thread-Count sheets, but the balls ruin them."
3,"The Grand 1000-Thread-Count 100% Cotton King Sheet Set, Ivory",The set sheet is okay. Smooth to the touch and washes well. I have had better quality but for the money it is a very decent set.
4,luxury sheets,The top sheet is a little short on the sides but they feel so good I don't care.I love these sheets.
4,Heavy weight sheets,"These are the thickest sheets I've ever purchased. Not quite as soft as I expected from 1000 threadcount, but a few washing should do the trick."
4,1000 count sheets,"Upon receiving it, I was eager to try it after reading the reviews. I was able to purchase this product for $40 and thought it was a great deal. After washing it and trying it out, it was nice and smooth but wasn't up to my expectations as I have some other lower thread count sheets that were of similar quality."
4,Nice sheets for the price,"They are noticeably better than the Ralph Lauren sheets I was using before, but I don't know that I would pay full price for them.Still, Amazon had them for half price and they were certainly a steal for what I paid. Good quality and comfortable. They wash well, although they've only been washed twice as they are still pretty new.They fit my extra deep pocket mattress with no problem."
5,Excellent value,These sheets are an excellent value. The quality is far beyond what I expected for the price I paid.
3,1000 Tread Sheet Set,Only rated so low because I don't remember purcashing these. I must have purchased and given as a gift.
5,Very Nice Sheets,The fabric is very dense and soft. They were nice when they got here and have stayed that way through a number of washings. I think they are a good value for the quality.
4,"Very nice, but 400 count is not far behind........","In the same week I bought a 400 count set of sheets from Sam's Club and these 1000 count sheets through Amazon.com. Simply said, I love both of them, but being totally honest, I can't tell the difference in the way they feel. Perhaps the 400 count I bought were very high quality, but there is no significant difference between the 400 and 1000 count sheets.I have washed both of the sets and neither set piled. They are both wearing very well, and if anything, they are getting softer, thus getting better, with time!I saw other people who said that they didn't like their sheets. If that is the case they must be a whole lot pickier than I am, and I usually consider myself to be very picky!"
5,For the price you can't beat it!,We just bought a Westin heavenly bed from Nordstrum's and were replacing sheets. My wife was not crazy about a white or cream color but I as most of my purchases at Amazon it is because I know we won't get out to the local store and buy because of time.So I ordered the cream colored sheets because you can't have a new bed without new sheets. I can tell you that they feel great. They feel like quality and I'm sure you can get better but these make you feel great. She thought the price was too good to be true but we were both pleasantly surprised.Watch for when they drop to 69 vs 79 and scoop them up.
4,Worth the price,I am quite happy with the sheets. They are soft but very sturdy as the other reviews have said. The fitted sheet is perfect in size but I would have liked the top sheet to be a little larger in width. It is adequate but I would prefer ample.
4,Too small but very comfortable,"We received these sheets as a wedding gift about a year ago. The sheets are very soft and smooth, and a very good value! However, it seems like these sheets were almost made for a full mattress rather than a queen. It's very hard to get the fitted sheet on the mattress. If I were to purchase these again, I would probably buy the king set for our queen mattress."
1,Great for short sheeting,"These are lovely, thick, sturdy cotton sheets, but only if you're a short-sheeting prankster. The size on the top sheet label is 106 x 102. Actual measured size is a meager 90! x 102 -- a full 16"" shorter than advertised. This makes it impossible to tuck the top sheet in. Also to be noted: the elastic on the bottom sheet lasted through exactly one washing before giving up. Luckily, the bottom sheet is such a tight fit on a Cal King that elastic isn't needed to keep it on.Shame on Amazon for shorting their customers. Maybe I was just unlucky, but shame on Amazon nonetheless. Maybe they'll learn something from hanging around from the Zappos folks."
3,Ironing Needed!!,"I like this product BUT I don't like the fact that it looks sloppy on the bed if you don't iron it before you use it. Needless to say, I'm not spending an hour every time I want to use these sheets, ironing them!There are indeed nicer sheets to purchase that do not require ironing, I'd definately purchase them instead. These sheets also do not seem to be any softer than the 500 thread count ones I purchased at about the same time. As far as holding up? I haven't had them long enough to tell."
2,1000 Thread Count?,"These sheets feel like Target sheets, 250 thread count. Very disappointed with their feel. Perhaps with several washings they will become more soft. If I had not thrown out the packaging, I would have returned them. The linens from the Linen Source have sheets that truly feel like 1000 thread count. So when I want that luxurious feel, I use those sheets."
2,Returning these sheets,"I was not expecting sateen sheets, I like heavy smooth cotton sheets. These are heavy, not all that smooth and small, the bottom sheet fit nice and tight, but one of the corners had a hole in it. The top sheet is tiny. It barely tucks in at the end (my mattress is thick but but not a pillow top or super thick) there's about 3 inches hanging past the end of the mattress and barely covers the mattress on the sides. I waited for these to go down for about 8 months - so though I only paid $64.99 - I'm returning them. Oh, the pillow cases barely cover my pillows. (and they are standard size) Buy at your own risk."
1,1000 Thread Count Sheet Set,I ws so excited to order these sheets but I am so disappointed in them. They SHUNK so bad the first time I washed them that I couldn't even use them on the bed. I wish I could send them back and get my money back.
4,Grand 1000 Count Sheets are heavy!,"We received 1000 count sheets that were reported as satiny, they are heavy! This is what quality feels like, but maybe this is not what we anticipated. Because of the count they are not what I will be using come summertime. They are smooth, but due to the weight, slow to dry after washing. I still want to feel sheets like in The Regis Hotel in NYC. I keep hoping."
2,"Quality sheets, but poor fit",The sheets are good quality and nice and thick. I washed them on a gentle cycle before putting them on the bed since my husband and I have somewhat sensitive skin. When trying to put them on they didn't quite fit our California King even though that was the size I ordered and they were described as having deep pockets. If the sheets were a few inches longer and wider they'd be perfect. At this point they're unusable for our bed.
4,Good thick sheets,"Would totally recommend these sheets. They are thick without being heavy and very smooth even after a year or so now of constant use, and show almost no wear."
3,The grand 1000,Not what I expected in a 1000 count sheet set. They are not as soft or smooth as one would have though. They do fit the bed well. Washed them and found that they come out of the dryer a mass of wrinkes. Would not buy this set of sheets again. Sometimes the more the thread count does not mean it will be a superior product as in this case. Overall I am not really satisfied with this set of sheets.
4,"Finland, my Finland..","The colour is wrong, but I won't hate on a $0.50 flag too much. My neighbours hate me for this flag, so I'll fly it everyday."
5,Love this album!,"This is a great album. I especially love the alternate versions of ""Come, Come Ye Saints"" and ""Praise to the Man.""""Be Thou My Vision,"" ""Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing,"" and ""How Can I Keep from Singing"" were also lovely.""One of the vocalists has a somewhat breathy voice -- which I'm not fond of -- but the other vocalist has a rich voice, and she also enunciates very well, which -- as a singer myself-- I appreciate.The arrangements are interesting, and the instrumental selections are lively. I don't think you will be disappointed."
3,Entertaining but Hokey,Loved the fake long distance retrieve of a downed bird (would have been funny if 1/10th of the video weren't dedicated to it though).
4,Ww2 downsized,"I've played all three games. My favorite of the three is European Assult, but thats only because of the graphics. The main thing that they all have in common is that you have to KILL every enemy soldier. Why can't EA games make a war game where you can just shoot the enemy in the arm, or leg and capture them. Plus neither of these games ever touch upon the subjects of the holocaust or pow camps."
3,Not a bad choice,"This book has a solid foundation of grammar and vocabulary teaching, but it is a little too elementary for a French three book. The instructions are in English, and the activities are generally rewording the exact questions into answers. This suffices as a book to teach the language, but there are much better options for actually learning and developing the use of the language."
5,Without doubt the best Marx Bros. book I've read.,"It's rare for a book on a specific subject to be so extremely well-written that it's worth recommending to people on that basis alone. This is a book which would be entertaining and even hilarious to people who aren't Marx Brothers fanatics. Even the classic anecdotes that Marxophiles have read a thousand times are told with such wit and energy that they feel new. Adamson's work has served to greatly enhance my already fanatical interest. And yes, even the footnotes are funny."
3,"Nice try, but not that funny","There are two ways to write about comedians. The way which sometimes works is to play straight man and let the funny people be funny. The way which always fails is to try to be funnier than the material. Adamson has the annoying habit of doing this, and it ruins an otherwise well-researched and otherwise decently written book. Tons of pictures, lots of great Marxist dialogues, a great (if slightly obsolete) bibliography."
2,Adamson isn't a Marx Brother,"So he should stop trying, at tedious length throughout the book, to be one. Yes there's an admirable wealth of research here but it's constantly obscured by the author's tiresome sense of humor. It feels like he's watched all the movies again and then felt like he could reprocduce their humour.He fails.His writing style is annoying and obstructive. His analysis of the films is pedantic and often misjudged. But the biggest crime of all is making it too much a book about how funny Joe Admason thinks he is and not enough of just letting the Marxes brilliant comic voice shine though. Try Simon Louvish's ""Monkey Business"" for a better read on the boys or Richard Anobile's controversial but hugely entertaining ""A Marx Bros Scrapbook""."
3,Too much going on,"I started out really liking this book - the characters seemed interesting, and the relationships were engaging. And then it seems to have gotten out of the author's hands. The plot started galloping along with more and more twists and turns that just overwhelmed the story. It wasn't enough to have the Napoleonic wars. Nope, we had to get wicked family members who ended up not so wicked, industrialization riots, class conflicts, prophetic dreams, country superstitions, and competing love interests for both the h & h. All of this, of course, prevented the h & h from being 3-dimensional characters or actually developing a relationship; instead they just kept falling into bed. It's a shame it ended up so disappointing."
2,Bored to Death,"The book was hard to read. too detail oriented. Had to skip all around the book to see if it was worth reading. It was not, it made a good sleeping pill"
2,Interesting,"The story was interesting. The the war seemed a might endless. I do not like books where I am what I call ""peeking in a private window"" I don't need a detailed description of married sex. Its none of my business, it cheapens the story. After Nicholas gets back from the war then we are fed pages and pages of his recovery in Spain. It was not necessary and rather boring. I found myself skipping forward to the present. I think there are too many people and too many authors who equate sex with love. Married sex is a gift but it proves nothing. People get sex and love confused which is part of the problem in society. Too bad. I did not believe that Nicholas had a deep love for his wife. The sex proved nothing. The book had some very good moments that were not developed. I think if the non-sexual relationships between the main characters had been more developed then the love would have been more believable."
2,Not that great,This book took me 4 days to finish. The story did not flow well. I did not feel the emotional connection between Julia & Nick.
3,Disappointed with short life,"Doing my best to avoid nickel cadmium batteries that can not hold a charge after a few uses, I bought these upgraded batteries. They did not last 100 recharges. Great drill! But, batteries should be rechargeable for at least 500 charges."
2,Dead batteries,"Brought two replacement batteries in 2009...and they are not holding charge any more in 2011.only got two years thought I would get more life..the first two batteries did last longer and the drill is still goodAs I am far away in the caribbean, think its Time to buy another brand...drill.."
4,Madcap Rock Opera - and then some!,"This is really quite something. *something* being the key word, because, you see, this is not the easiest CD to describe. Basically what you need to know is this here is good musics indeed. Infact, you could say that these guys are coming into their own just as They Might be Giants appear to be struggling a bit. Which is handy.Furthermore, every little bit of support for request-a-song.com represents a kick in the proverbials of the music establishment, as way they go about things is revolutionary.There's stuff on this CD I didn't like when they were originally posted on the internet, but the remastering makes them go the distance.Huzzah and Congratulations!"
1,Product not received,since the product was not received I cannot give a good review for this transaction
1,"Not 'Why Things Bite Back' but ""How things Bite Back'",This is an interesting catalog of the how of technological unintended consequences but is lacking in the why. If all you need is more evidence of well-intentioned planners making errors in judgment read this book or your daily newspaper. If you are looking for insight into why man's plans 'oft gang agley' look elswhere. I enjoyed skimming this book but at the end I was disappointed. More meat less monday quarterback.
4,Get To Know Why Things Go Wrong,Ever since we have been trying to improve our environment or ourselves things seem to go unexpectidly wrong. This book has some compelling arguments about why. It was a good read even if the author does go past his arguments at times. Good references though I haven't check any. Should be good for preliminary college paper research.
4,Intriguing thoughts on our world,"This book shows the intriguing, frustrating, path our civilization has wandered and continues to wonder through. It is as though we are on a roller coaster that can not stop and can not get off. Makes one ponder our future.By the way, on page 99, I believe it should read ""Marina District"" not "" Mission District"" I was living in the Mission at time of quake. We had no problems, but watched smoke from the Marina to northwest."
4,A great read for cynics,"After reading this book, it's hard not to see unintended consequences everywhere. A great insight into the fallability of man, and the need for an in-depth understanding of complex systems"
1,Mistitled?,"Maybe I had the wrong expectations from a book titled ""Why Things Bite Back."" I expected to read what it was about things and our relationships to them that create discomfort and even tragedy. I wanted an exploration into why the drawbacks of things are overlooked until it's too late, and how we can learn to avoid that. Instead I got ""A Bunch of Things That Go Wrong,"" story after story of the unforseen consequences of technologies. I was looking for insight and got observation instead."
2,Terribly frustrating to read. Just seems narrow-minded,"The writing is fine and there's some good stories, but he is frustratingly glum. I think there are good/bad consequences and a whole book just on the bad is boring to read. In the end, I just got angry and skimmed the last 1/3. Skip this book; use your common sense."
4,Thoroughly iconoclastic in the the age of progress...,"The author simply points out that progress is fraught with irony; however, mass consumer capitalism requires an uninformed, compulsive, infantile consumer and planned obsolescent gadgets and technological gizmos--that's all (ask any maketeer).Although I'm impressed by the author's effort and considerable research; so what?Skip this book and check it out from the library and lend to your literate friend(s) for future cocktail party discussions."
2,Very parochial,"This very interesting subject is sadly let down by the parochial point of view of the writer who has concentrated on a USA-centric view of the world, the the almost complete exclusion of developments (and unintended consequences) outwith the US of A.The exclusive use of the outdated Imperial measurement system is also a major annoyance."
3,"Sheesh! Of course the world is screwed up, but...","Why not ignore the parts of the world that you dislike and enjoy the parts that areagreeable? There are enough people who complain, dare to be different.Our computers are fantastic! Never have we had more toys to play with!"
2,Simple Premise,"I already knew most of what Tenner's book contained and therefore, I was bored early on. Not as interesting as I had hoped"
2,"interesting concept, not much else","The idea of the novel was the only thing that kept me going through the length of it. Personally, I was disappointed with the writing, which was sparse (thoroughly lacking in detail), almost to the point of being childish. The running joke throughout is a tired one: a foreign country boy dopily wondering at the amazing modern technology of our obviously more civilized and advanced society. Funny, at first, but it grows old quickly, along with the story in general. In all, a very unimpressive, strangely moralistic work that was kind of offensive for me as an Asian."
1,The Laughing Sutra by Mark Salzman,"The laughing sutra by Mark Salzman "" I am the chinese Tom Sawyer."" a naive, but courageous orphane from China trying to track down a elusive Buddhist scripture with a man who has yellow eyes and sharp teeth who carry's a large iron pole that a man couldn't carry like walking stick who the Hsun-ching also believes to be the now questionable fictional character the Monkey king. How far would you go for loyalty would you go half way around the word throwing 'elf height' people would you mind being shot at all for loyalty because as Hsun-ching puts it ""without loyalty the world would be chaos there would be nothing that separates us from the animals."" I don't think thats true do you?"
5,A wonderful wonderful book!,"I have read this book twice, once in high school and another just recently. This novel is a similar story to ""Journey to the West,"" talking about a monk who goes on a pilgrimage with his disciples to find the teachings of Buddha, only that this novel takes place in slightly modern times. Salzman has creatively re-invented the story with much enthusiasm and humor.I have recommended this book to many of my friends and all of them have enjoyed reading it. For younger readers, I think they should read it a second time later on in their lives to get a better understanding of the book. (I understood it better after my second reading.)To conclude this, Salzman is a wonderful and talented writer. I have just recently purchased more of his books and can't wait till I dive into those stories!"
4,"Well concieved, but the execution is rough in places","This is an enjoyable modernization of the classic Chinese fable of ""The Journey to the West."" In this case, ""the West"" is the United States. Salzman does an excellent job of seamlessly introducing his U.S. readers to the essence of the fable, and its hero the Monkey King. He then lays the rest of his story over that framework. All in all, it is delightfully written. The characters are well-formed and the descriptive language is fresh and insightful. My only complaints are that occasionally it seems the story goes off track to make a joke about a cultural disparity and there are some continuity gaps that are probably the result of editing."
1,Not recommended!,First the hat arrived very quickly. That's why I gave it a star. If you are even minimally familiar with fatigue caps (covers to Marines) you will know right out of the gate this a extremely poor knock off. The bill is passable but the cover itself has no height to it and no shape of any kind.Thought it was worth a try for 8 bucks but not even worth the trouble off returning it! BUY FROM ROTHCO.I would definitely not recommend this to an enemy let alone a friend.
5,Excellent drumming!,"I've been playing Assiya from Ido Ziv non-stop for days now. This album blends many different types of music into one great sound. The tunes are hypnotic at times, held together by some excellent drumming. I highly recommend this amazing disc."
3,Your bedroom filled with a blue glare,"The product in general is pretty nice, but has a few serious minusses:It's not real easy to work with: it's not very intuitive; I found setting the time and alarm complicated; and the manual is not a big help: the instructions are not very clear.The real disappointment comes when you turn off the lights in your room: the blue display fills the room with an annoyingly blue light(glare), even in dimmed mode !I will give it a try for a few more days; but I think this is a candidate for return."
3,Incorrect description,This radio does not have weather alert despite the description claming otherwise and the battery backup only backs up the time... so if the power fails in a storm you're out of luck.
1,"Quick, press next, don't stop here.","This radio was so bad, I threw it out! The CD player broke in a about a week, you needed a PHd and a book to set the alarms. It ended up in the trash."
1,another child's attempt at poetry,"The poetry is a mishmash of disconnected thoughts written from a child's perspective to followers who only can guess what this is; it is not poetry. I would guess the zen master wrote disengaged and unrelated notes collected over years and transcribed them with short unintelligible bursts of amateurly enlightened pseudointellectualism onto pages for others to gush about. Had a reviewer been knowledgeable, I would have never been bamboozled to purchase. I returned the book."
2,What am I missing?,"I read this book at the suggestion of a counselor who is helping me through depression and lack of interest in my career. While I was touched by his insights and authenticity, I was nagged by the practical aspect (or lack thereof) of letting your life speak. Palmer seemed to have an endless amount of time and resources to find his true calling in life. How does this apply to people who struggle just to put food on the table, who lack the means to get a higher education, or who have a family to support? Palmer's journey seems to be a luxury that many can't afford. Also, he seems to gloss over the difficulties involved in discovering that you picked the wrong path- not only for the self, but for all the others involved (spouse, children, friends).A lovely book, but too ""pie in the sky"" for me."
1,"fluffy. very, very fluffy.","my god, what an obnoxious, over-wrought, self-important heap of nonsense. this man thinks far too highly of his life story, which is low on anything truely trying and high on sentimentality. i quote:""i love the fact that the word humus, the dacayed vegatable matter that feeds the roots of plants, comes from the same root that gives rise to the word humility. it is a blessed etymology. it helps me understand that the humiliating events of life, the events that leave 'mud on my face' or that 'makes my name mud' may create the fertile soil in which something new can grow.""well, good for you, pal. the oft-used metaphores and life stories that are not incoherent are utterly laughable in a droll, sugary way that does not lend itself to serious reading. some people may be capable of enjoying such writing and finding it truly inspiring. i am not one of those folks, and do not reccomend this book. to anyone."
4,Very helpful,"Of course, Parker Palmer is a voice worthy of listening to, and in this book he describes his own journey with debilitating depression and how it spoke him into the life he was called into-not the one he thought he ""should"" be living. Since all of us need to discern our own path, it is helpful to hear someone else's struggle and discernment as a reference."
2,Make Your Decision on this Book Very Carefully!,"Mr. Palmer writes eloquently, poetically, and scholarly. He is truly an intellectual, and has definitely made insightful revelations...about *his* life. If you are looking for a systematic, step-by-step approach to finding your vocation, read Stephen Covey's 7 Habits. If you want a book on letting your vocation find you, written in intricate metaphor and poetry, this is the one! I am so grateful that we have so many wonderful writers for so many wonderful subjects. Different writers affect different people in different ways! You decide!"
2,This is guy is still confused...,"This book reminds me of the people sitting around in yoga positions meditating on themselves. Some how this author thinks that by stumbling around in the world and then reflecting back (sometimes as far back as childhood) is the way to find our place in life. ""let your life speak""... sure, if you want to contiuously be living by your emotions and feelings, which change like the sand on the shore. He did not convence me that he found peace in his life, but rather peace for the moment, how sad. Like a boat being tossed in the wind and waves with no rudder.A good point he hammers on is reflecting on your past so that you dont make the same mistakes."
2,Interesting if Not Useful,"I found this book to be an interesting read into one man's journey toward self-discovery. He has some good insights into how one might take a different view of the world and find one's true vocation.From my perspective, it was a bit too self-absorbed and self-engrandizing. I would recommend this book to anyone that is depressed about his or her life and needs to find a potential source of comfort. If you have a fairly good sense of self, this book may not be of great benefit."
1,Jouney Inward or out of myself,"I read the first 80 pages of this book carefully, but just looked at the subjects afterwards. I don't think the book helped me because I matured as I quit focusing on myself. This book suggessts the opposite.Palmer writes very well about this journey, but I didn't learn what most of us need- to be lees self-preoccupied.Sorry, I would not recommend the book, though I know many would be impressed by it."
2,"Not a ""How-to_","This book is not a ""how-to"" as the title suggests. The author merely relates his own journey through depression and doubt to a career in which he was healthy and happy. He assumes that jobs are readily available and that everyone has an education which prepares them for different careers. The language he uses, as well as his sentence structure, would make the book a bit difficult to read for the average reader. Throw in LOTS of metaphysical poetry and poetry references and most readers would be scratching their heads and leave the book unfinished.I don't recommend this book."
3,You are not alone,"This book is for people who are searching for affirmation that life gives you ups AND downs, that this is okay, and that there may be a reason for why your life is leading the direction that it is. A book that brings a lot of mind churning to the person reading, trying to see just where do ""I fit in/how does this help me."""
2,ok,cover was missing. marked up a bit on the inside. it would have been nice to see that in the description. otherwise in ok condition.
2,Paradox to Christianity,"Biblical Christianity is about Truth being outside ourselves. I did not read the whole of this book. There was a principle that could no longer allow me to read further. It was a principle that the author believed that allowing a being outside yourself to dictate to you what you should be is wrong. God is outside humanity. We are to be governed by God in all things, according to the Bible. To make self the center and finding within yourself your answers is a principle of spiritualism not Christianity. I must now re-examine his other book that I was reading. I hope this is helpful."
5,This book changed my life.,"I wish I could let Parker Palmer know - this book changed my life. It made me stop and listen to the still voice within in regard to my life's work. I have highlighted, starred, and underlined so many passages. It gave me the courage to make a change that I needed to make. Palmer's insights and way of articulating those insights in regard to turning away from the world and listening to one's self when it comes to vocation resonated with me on such a deep level. I'm forever thankful to him."
5,Validating....,"This book is an inspiration for those feeling ""the pull""--the struggle between ""what society tells me I should be doing"" and ""what I feel I need/was born to do"". Both my husband and I could not put it down. Palmer validated our feelings of ""I don't think the rat race is what life is really about..."" whereby giving us the confidence to pursue major life and career changes. Read a paragraph, stop and think...and then read on...."
4,Don't be fooled by the cheesy cover,"This is a smart book for all faithfilled people looking to make a vocation change or take stock in their life. Far more well written and grounded than most ""spiritual"" books out there."
3,Wanted more,"I recently heard Parker Palmer speak, and was left wanting to hear more, thus the reading of this book. In his speach, I had just a taste of what he had to say about vocation. He seemed to never get around to addressing that topic, although it was the title of his talk. The beginning of this book contains much wisdom regarding vocation, but soon became a discussion of Palmer's personal struggle with depression. While the early discussion on vocation was meaningful, there was too little of it, in an already short book. Admittedly, he states that it was not a ""how to"" book for others to follow his directions, but rather that they would be able to learn from his experiences and apply them to their own lives. I will say, it gave me the clearest picture of depression that I have ever seen. But, I was reading for vocation, and would have liked more about that."
3,A little bit dated and hippie dippy,"If you went to high school in the 1960s, this book's for you. The rambling insights of a person who lived in a Quaker commune (seriously) is, at best, a psychedelic relic. Why are baby boomers so sure they got it right? If you want rambling introspection, you'll love this. If you are pragmatic (and likely born after the boomers), it is doubtful you'll find this helpful. There are some good sections, but this has a ""father (he'd likely use ""parent"") knows best"" tone that is a bit or a lot annoying. Perhaps not for the 21st Century."
3,Northwest music,An interesting combination of grunge and mainstream rock. Almost like weezer in a major key and better vocals.
2,Frustrating.,"Ditto ""ashamed"" previous. The workbook is difficult to use, and filled with errors. The tapes are frustrating and uneven, switching from too-difficult narratives to too-easy exercises. I've been through 18 chapters and 9 tapes, and can't speak. The textbook itself is better than the workbook and tapes. It is heavy on grammar and verb conjugation."
1,They should be ashamed,"This lab manual, to be used with the accompanying recordings, is of extremely low quality. The mistakes are so frequent that you cannot use the material for effective feedback. I am about two thirds of the way through this course and, if anything, the errors are getting worse and more frequent. I am required to finish the material for a class, but am considering not doing any more of the lab work to focus on higher quality audio learning sources. This is my third foreign language and I have never seen such an incompetent attempt to throw together materials. Do yourself a favor and go with French in Action - it is in every sense a superior system of learning french."
5,Excellent Textbook - Easy to Understand,"This is the favorite French textbook I have ever had and I have been studying French for um... 6 or 7 years. It is well-written and easy to understand. The chapters are well-organized and I think the best part is how the authors explain verbs and verb conjugations... there are so many ways, ugh! However, there is a new 7th edition out now, so if you need this textbook for a class check to see which edition you need before you buy this textbook. Also, this book is geared toward beginning students so it may not be too helpful if you already know a fair amount of French."
1,Just Not Tall Enough,"The antenna seemed like a good idea, but living in a rural area it is not tall enough to bring in any stations."
4,Gentle Tai Chi,"I have just started a Tai Chi class, so this DVD with help me be able to continue using it after the class has ended and keep what I have learned in my mind."
1,Gentle Tai Chi,Just a few warm up moves put together in a kota. Might be good if you wanted something short to do while sitting.
5,A wonderful gift,"I've tried Tai Chi before, but could never really get into it. However, this DVD is wonderful. The teacher does a good job explaining the different moves. There is a basic introductory section, then a learning section where each move is demonstrated separately. Next, the DVD moves into the routine itself, smoothly going from one movement to the next. Finally, there is a section for people who have trouble standing for as long as the session goes, demonstrating how you can do this routine while sitting in a chair.I have arthritis in my knees, and different exercises are hard for me to do. However, this DVD has been a wonderful gift for me, allowing me to do the routine well and comfortably. I highly recommend it."
3,Where's the last chapter?,"Tsukiyama does a lovely job of describing her characters and their ""small moments."" I came to the final pages caring about each person and wishing to know more. That is not unusual; I often feel that way about my favorite books. In this case, however, there is a sense that the author forgot to finish. Early in the story, she carefully establishes that Dr. Truman has a white car, that he always drives white cars. At end of the book, when the women all arrive at the beach, there is only one other car - a WHITE car - already there. Any reader would note the first fact and recognize that Dr. Truman is at the beach. Any reader would expect a climax to occur. Instead, there are simply more lovely small moments. Taukiyama has avoided being predictable, but she has left her readers dithering."
3,"Great concept, poor follow-through","The idea and concept of a young woman dying of old-age disease could be an intersting story. However, there was a lack of depthness to this novel. Ms. Tsukiyama writes each chapter assuming a different character, however, I had to keep going back to the chapter title to see who was speaking because there was no way to distinguish one character from another - they all spoke in very similar styles and language (almost as if she took on ALL of the characters herself - a one-woman show!), sometimes overly poetic or heavy on the metaphores and similes, that it took away from the story. Towards the end, it did get more touching and I must admit, I did get a tightness in my throat, but the ending left a lot unsaid, unsettled and could have had more meat to it.I love her other book Women of the Silk, and was hoping for more."
3,"Sad, but readable tone","I loved Women of the Silk and Samauri's Garden was okay. I was kind of disappointed in this book. I'm glad I got it from the library. It is a quick read, because each ""chapter"" is about a page, and they start it halfway down one page and finish it at the top of the next page. Some are so short, they indented where they shouldn't have to make the chapter stretch out. The book is 288 pages, but if it was published like any other normal book it MIGHT be 100 pages. This book should have been published as a story. That said, it isn't a bad way to spend a couple hours."
2,not for me.,"Tsukiyama knows hwo to write beautifully, BUT her metaphors and poeticisms feel too contrived. This novel is for lonely, flighty housewives. If you enjoy daytime soaps and/or exoticized perversions of the Asian culture, you'll love Dreaming Water."
4,Charlie Chan vintage movies,The Chan series of movies has been a favorite of mine for years. I purchased this series when I saw them at such a reasonable price; My ome reservation about these films is that Mantan Moreland is not in any of them.
1,Your Pass Please,"I have enjoyed Charlie Chan movies ever since I was a child. Most of them are a lot of fun. This one is the exception. It is absolutely the worst I have watched. After buying this film and watching it one time, I donated it to a charity auction.Take a pass on this one."
2,"Middling Monogram Chan, but fans will enjoy it","This is one of the low-budget ""Charlie Chan"" mysteries produced by Monogram Pictures. This time the murder victim (more precisely, the first of several victims!) is a scientist that everyone has good reason to hate. Chan steps in on the government's behalf to solve the mystery of how ""dead men walk."" Some decent performances (Mantan Moreland, Frank Reicher, Hardie Albright, and especially Alan Bridge as the hayseed sheriff), but the characters aren't as colorful, the direction not as brisk, and Charlie's inquisitive offspring not as engaging as usual. The mystery will definitely keep you guessing, however. This and star Sidney Toler are the main assets."
4,Mantan and Toler Steal the Show,"Enjoy simplicity. It's another time and place without cell phones, computers, or ipads. Good and evil are not hard to distinguish here, but the guilty party is often a surprise."
4,Good product,These bags are a bit pricey but they do work well. They are not hard to put on or take off so that's a plus too.
3,Attaches Well So Far,These bags fit my Kirby Heritage II machine well. They take no more coercion than my previous bags did which were purchased at my local Kirby dealer. Much easier to buy online!
1,NOT HAPPY WITH ITEM,"Purchased this flag for a Christmas gift for a friend. Received the box and it was the wrong item , called the company and told them that I received the wrong item.they were nice to say that I could keep the item,and will send me the flag. well the flag was not a two sided flag that I wanted .My friend is okay with the flag but it was not the one I orderd."
3,"Pleasant performances, but DREADFUL SOUND!","I feel compelled to write this, to alert unsuspecting customers (such as I was) that despite the 1960's dates bandied about in the review I read, which contained frequent references to ""good"" sound, and ""unique"" sound world, etc. these are actually DREADFUL, boomy ""MONO"" recordings that do a grave disservice to Reger's well-known dense orchestral writing. - In fairness, I give it 3 stars only in recognition of Scherchen's pleasing interpretations, which in some of the pieces I was familiar with seem to out-class Jarvi and others I've heard (Davis, Polyansky,etc).So do not be fooled by another reviewer's talk of the ""sound"" of these recordings. Sadly, Reger's textures need all the help they can get, but they certainly aren't helped by the muddy sound here..."
3,"Reger: Symphony #2 Op. 95 (which he called a ""serenade.""","Thank goodness your CDs present at least an abridged version of this lovely but very neglected work. It's a real shame that the abridged 3rd section (""movement"") leaves a very striking interlude completely out, but the abridged presentation is definitely much better than not having any of Op. 95 at all. Very truly yours, David J. Vance"
1,What a TRASH!!,"I have bought this product on September 2007. Which is about less then 2 years ago. about 6 months ago, I got one serious pixel issue. Since it was over 1 year which is warranty period, I thought it's not worth a fixing it with paying so much money.And 2 days ago... It died. Less then 2 years of using... And trust me, I don't watch TV that much at all. Probably 6 hours on weekends and 2 hours on weekdays. Do not buy this POS."
1,People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones,"Ian Williams has been all over the media lately after it was revealed by Accuracy in Media -- and Williams doesn't deny it-- that he had been taking money from the UN while covering the UN for The Nation and other media. Williams went on the O'ReillyFactor and said he saw no ethical issue with that blatant violation of journalism ethics.Then came revelations in Accuracy in Media and Front Page Magazine that his wife, who can't even work in the U.S. legally, got a job at a journalism organization where Williams has clout.Given his shamelessness, this tired rehash of previously published allegations against Bush is even more disgusting. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones."
1,"Hate, Hate and More Hate.","How can a book look ""objectively at the military record of George W. Bush"" and declare that he was ""AWOL for the best part of a year?"" It doesn't even say ""allegedly"" AWOL! I look forward to seeing the court martial records of Bush's indictment and conviction for being AWOL... a specific criminal violation under the UCMJ. It is too bad that some will try to equate this hack-job with the well-sourced ""Unfit for Command"" by the Swiftboat Vets. I fear for the President after he wins a stunning victory on November 2nd... What are these people going to do with their hate?"
5,"Very Terrifying, 100% believable",Very good as i believe very much in UFO's. As I have seen a few weird things.
5,Great advice for job seekers,"As an HR Executive who conducts hundreds of interviews, I often wish I could advise the people I meet with on how to improve their interviewing skills. The advice that Jeanne Knight offers in her DVD and Study Guide is dead on and covers everything I would want people to know to succeed on an interview.Effective interviewing involves preparation - and both the video and the exercises in the Study Guide enable candidates to do the necessary preparation to help them demonstrate their qualifications for, and interest in, the job they are interviewing for. If candidates take the time to watch the DVD, complete the exercises in the Study Guide, and apply the advice offered, they will not only make my job easier, but most importantly, they will significantly increase their chances of being offered the job."
5,Very good knowledge even for those with a lot of experience in interviewing,"I bought this DVD just to show it in my business communication class. Yet, I am amazed what this video has taught me more than what I would have expected. Jeanne Knight's advice will definitely help you sell yourselves, answer the tough questions, and get the job you want."
2,Expensive for a dated book,"The book is out of date, covering ArcObjects in ArcMap v 8.x.Even if it were current (up to ArcObjects 9.x), I did not find the book particularly useful or interesting, covering only the rudimentary basics of programming ArcObjects.Code is very poorly documented and explanations are thin."
4,Good book,"First-off, there is a new edition of this book coming out. So, i won't judge this one on 'outdatedness.'This is a very good follow-up to the 'getting to know arcpbjects' book from esri (which are the only 2 guide books to arcobjects out there).It is fairly easy to read, and i like the code given in the text and on the cd, especially on the cd, because you can copy and paste it right into your ArcGIS.Overall a good instructional book on various arcobjects technics."
2,So much Potential wasted.,I am not sure if I should blame the author for this injustice or Wizard's of the Coast for their forced literary requirements. The reason I say this is because WotC makes their paperback writers adhere to a 300 page limit. I played and DM'd these modules in my younger years and there was just so much left out or not developed it is hard to place the blame on any one particular group. On the other hand Paul Kidd did a very good job with his paperback books so its hard to say. This novel could have easily been 3 books and they probably would have been fantastic. It is a shame that the Greyhawk themed books are treated like the red headed step child. Borrow this book or buy it used but do not buy it new.
2,Water Monkey is right,"This definitely read more like a module than a novel - and a bad module at that. I love Greyhawk, and literally couldn't finish reading this book, it was too painful. Going back and reading some Dragonlance novels is slowly restoring my faith in TSR novels..."
1,Beyond terrible,"About a third of the way in, I could only think, ""Who the hell is Ru Emerson, and why did WOTC let her write a book about a classic module which she's obviously never played?""About halfway in, I just gave up. Terrible characters, zero plot, nothing to hold my interest.I have to thank Ru for one thing, though -- she's given me hope as to actually becoming a published writer one day. There's no way I could do a worse job than this. Then again, neither could a half-drunk wildebeast."
2,Huge disappointment,"Having gone thru all the Patrick O'Brien, C.S. Forester & Richard Woodman novels in the age of sailing ships, I tried this & was profoundly disappointed! This should be first & foremost labeled ""fantasy, pre-teen"". Even if one could swallow the ""time warp"" premise, the resulting actions leave out any concept of the reality that might have been dove into in blending the two totally disparate times. But, even that wasn't as ridiculous as the ending... I admit that I like happy endings, but this was so far beyond the realm of reality as to be a parody. I suggest the author do a great deal of research into the real lives & times of the British seamen & the idioms used in those times... if indeed, he wishes us to view his work with more than dismay..."
1,Rip Off,"Tom Grundner has published this book twice; once as ""Between Two Flags"" in 2005 and once as ""Midshipman Prince"" in 2007."
3,"Ship""s Bells and No Cell Phone","This is a readable story with a taste of the unbeliveable. For some reason this story was published under two covers. The only difference was how the primary charater was saved by a British Man O War. Once the story line gets past this begining it becomes a very readable story. I titled this review ""Ships Bell and No Cell Phone"" because pasted inside the story its self are passages that refer to modern times.Don't put the book down it is a good story and readable.George L. WolderSan Diego, Ca."
4,Newer edition available,"Yes, this is a superb architecture survey of a city that is not frequently thought of for great architecture.It is written in standard AIA format, and includes about 500 entries. Be careful. Don't pay too much for this book when you can get a second edition (updated through 1999) for much less."
3,Wesley can be vague,"He can be a little vague at times, other times really out of left field and only comments on selected verses but is a good source to go along with other commentators of his day."
5,My Favourite Secret.,"Not many people in Canada (or North America in general) know about this book. And I'm the kind of person who likes to keep incredible things like this secret. I like to feel as though I am somehow privy to a very special and magnificent thing, and that I can choose which people deserve to be blessed with the knowledge of it. But if you're here, then someone has probably told you about Gormenghast, and has thus determined that you are an individual worthy of Mervyn Peake's great achievment. Just get the book immediately, read it, and fall into a world that you never dreamed anyone could imagine, much less describe with such stunning detail. It will, quite likely, be the single most incredible book you'll ever read. Honest."
5,Incomparable,"Comparison is futile. I first read these novels as a fifteen year old and am reading them through again ten years later. What was an earth-shaker as an adolescent is an earth-shaker now. I don't care much for fantasy novels in general. Mervyn Peake's novels thankfully defy genre and allow us a panoramic vision of a world at once fascinating and abominable, expansive and stifling. Gormenghast presents itself to the reader again and again, long after the words are spent, in half-waking images that reek of childhood bogeys and birthdays. All of this praise expended, the Gormenghast series is not for the weary-eyed. The third of the trilogy differs from the first two a great deal and presents its own challenges. Perhaps the first two are were more perfected. However, as a reader you must dedicate yourself to this work and see the race to the end to judge the finish."
5,a constant source of amazement,"It's a lamentable shame that Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" became the template for the subsequent development of the fantasy genre. If later authors had looked to Peake's Gormenghast books as their model, we might have a great deal more good literature in the world, and fewer orc-slaying fests with silly prophesy-driven plots.The Gormenghast world is richly imagined and beautifully described. The characters are unforgettable. This trilogy is one of the great achievements of 20th Century English literature."
1,Too many long descriptions,If you enjoy a lot of dark prose and imagery then you will probably love this book. Peake spends a lot of time describing characters and environment with only minimal attention to story. If you are waiting for an exciting storyline then you will probably be disappointed like I was...I put it down after a about 250 pages and couldn't get myself to pick it up again....and what I did read just bored me.....
2,Overrated,Strange at best. You wait and wait for a plot to develop and it never does. The series has no direction or purpose.
1,Great Imagery about Nothing Interesting.,"I have heard almost all of Titus Goan on an audio tape and its by far the worst book written by someone that likely could have written a great book I have ever seen. Some of the Reviews compare it to Tolkein, which is an insult to one of the greatest writers in the English Language to even make the comparison. Character development and imagery are important supports to the purpose of a novel, which is to tell a story. The story in Titus Groan is so weak that it is embarassing. The Characters are more jokes than realistic, well fleshed out perhaps, but highly uninventive. The same is true of the imagery, it is detailed to be sure, but Mr. Peake's imagination is sadly lacking as is the emotional content of his imagery. Mr. Peake dumped out a lot of words for no purpose whatsoever. The people that praised this novel sure need to re-read Tolkien and the other great writers."
1,"Wow, there goes several hours of my life.","I have been an avid fantasy reader for 30+ years. I enjoy some off-beat and contemporary works as well as the tolkien, jordan, eddings, hobb, rr martin, etc. This was quite simply the worst thing I have read in recent memory. The author is so absolutely fascinated with his own vocabulary and writing skill that he never tells the story. He just plays with words like a really big kid in a sandbox. Mervin is probably good at writing poetry. I wasn't trying to read poetry when I bought this book. I actually took it back to the bookstore and demanded a refund. Seriously. They did give me the refund too.If you want to read something older but great, check out the Belgariad series. Contemporary fantasy, Rothfuss is great."
1,The Worst Fantasy Book Ever Written,"This is easily the worst fantasy book ever written. Peake's grandiosely verbose and nonsensical writing style make this bookmost painful to read. The characters are very strange, the plot is uninteresting, and despite this book's being classified as fantasy, there is no magic involved.Peake doesn't compare favorably to Tolkien."
1,I'm with the guy sitting on the toilet,"I ordered this book based on the many positive reviews. I was in honors lit classes throughout high school and college and read some stange stuff. That being said, I am on the side of the guy who placed it in his bathroom.I have been trying to read it for two days. I am skimming to parts where characters actually speak and am rolling my eyes at the excessive description. I get the picture and the point the first time. I prefer to be lost in a good story, not a dictionary.This book won't even make it to the bathroom. It's in the bag to trade at the used book store. Perhaps I can trade it for something of value."
5,Master of imagination and the English language,"This is the greatest work of fiction I have ever read, and I have read many. Not only does Peake surpass the word-wielding and sentence-spinning legerdemain of geniuses like O. Henry and Shakespeare, his imagination paints pictures of stunning originality and depth of rumination about what it means to grow and be human. The characters are unforgettable and as unique as the scenes they spin. THIS IS WHAT FANTASY SHOULD BE, not that assembly-line, swords-sorcery, elves-dragons trash that weigh down the sighing bookshelves in our bookstores. Only Donaldson comes close with the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. Read it."
5,The Peak of Literature,"Gormenghast is, to me, the most beautiful use of the written English language, as Richard Burton's recitation of ""Under Milkwood"", by Dylan Thomas, is of the spoken.His characters and descriptive prowess lift the the imagination to dizzying levels."
1,Gormenghast: Fiction for Masochists (a review in rhyme),"To truly capture the tone of this work, nothing less than poetry will serve. And since these novels are pure tone with just a smattering of ""plot"", ""character"" or even ""drama"" this should be enough:Gormenghast, a poemEvil death is a grating thingTo what we wish is what we bringWithout hope or malice slightClean our knives so clean and brightHapless bent in turmoil and toilGrievous and listless sits the gargoyleBurned out and lonely beyond the palekeeping time here is a solemn hellConvulsions of manic ignoranceWakes us from restless somnambulanceDead trees cry out in painInfested bark sloughs off in the rainCrass furtive hurting scars the dayWithered and bent hair turning to grayEchos of love ignored and shunnedSmiling faces kicked and gunnedCreatures without hope, come to your kingTo the eternal night, wretched we bring"
5,A piece of literary genius,"As an avid reader and devourer of English literature, I was prepared to be disappointed in this ""classic"". I read the reviews, and I thought the story line sounded a bit preposterous, but I was intrigued enough that I thought I'd give Mervyn Peake a try.I have never been so enthralled by a book before (and for me, that's saying something). I found myself racing through it so I could start reading it all over again. And I didn't just reread this trilogy, I lovingly dissected it.Mervyn Peake was a genius with language-he painted pictures with his words. His command of the English language was masterful-I had to keep Webster's dictionary next to me as I read his works-he used words I didn't know existed.The Gormenghast trilogy defies classification. Mere summaries cannot do it justice. This is, by far, the most profound book I have ever read.Why couldn't I have found this book twenty years ago?"
4,A Deliriously Good Read!,"Reading The Gormenghast Novels feels like trudging knee-deep through cold mud on a hot summer day. Very exhausting yet immensely refreshing! Mervyn Peake writes beautifully; lyrical, descriptive and with a hint of the whimsical. The atmosphere was so thick with a sense of intrigue, I sometimes wonder if any of the characters are indeed sane! Everyone is so delirious, they blend right into the damp, moss-covered walls of the gothic castle. Read it and read it again to completely savour a truly good book."
4,Fresh even though not new,"This trilogy often gets compared with The Lord of the Rings, but I'd say it resembles Shadow of the Torturer more. Peake uses language beautifully and the world he cooks up is rich, vibrant, complex, and dark. Anyone who likes to read and who enjoys imaginative story-telling and good characters will enjoy this trilogy."
2,"Not so wonderful, really.","I admire Peake for writing fully from his dreams and imagination without a filter, creating a unique, surreal vision. But while the result must have been extremely satisfying for him, it is fairly indigestible for the reader. There are pearls of description among the dense prose, but there's also an enormous amount of dull repetition. Some characters held my interest (Flay, Fuschia, Steerpike), but many are one-dimensional cartoons and few if any have their motivations explained. As the plot is thin and moves at a glacial pace, it's easy to lose interest, bogged down among the Gothic trappings."
5,Agree with C.S. Lewis' comments,"This book expands consciousness, as wussy and stupid as that sounds, it was true for me. I've never read a book like this, you can't compare it to Lord of the Rings. As good as Lord of the Rings was, it was mass-produced, written for specific demographics (young-adults, which is ""coincidentally"" the biggest book buying audience. Well that's not fair, the book really didnt start selling until like 30 years later) Gormenghast is written for the writer, which to me is a much more honest way to create things (I guess in a way, so was Tolkein's Silmarillion, although I wouldn't necessarily consider it to have been written). He gives a new face to fear and desperation, an almost beauty to both. It took me a while to start reading this thing, but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. It's dark and depressing, but in such a new and different way, all over the story is incredibly original. Phenominal, absolutely excellent."
2,A Meandering Tale Where Nothing Happens,Most people that rated these stories on Amazon seem to really like them. I did not. The stories went nowhere. While the writing is 'pretty' the plots unfold at an agonizing pace.There is a scene in the book where someone is knocking on a door. The person in the room demands to know who is knocking no less than four times. The door knocker answers each time. I mention this only because it is an example of how the entire story is told.I left the book in a public location. Hopefully it was claimed by someone that could appreciate it. I could not.
1,"""Groan"" is right","I was recommended this book by someone with whom I share a common interest in fantasy literature. I bought the book and tried to read it three times, putting it down before 100 pages each time out of sheer boredom. After a couple of years I saw it on my bookshelf and told myself I would plow through it at last, no matter how boring it became. Well, this book took me longer to read than any other because I simply could not like it, no matter how hard I tried. Peake takes forever to introduce a character or plot point (when there are any). His verbosity surpasses Stephen Donaldson--and not in a good way. I will not spoil anything, but I would wager that anyone who has read this book can summarize its plot in two sentences. Short ones. I suppose I need more plot to keep me interested. Maybe someday I will read the second book, but after the first I don't know why I would."
5,A Classic of Fantasy,"Hearing that the BBC had made a film of this strange and compelling trilogy (and I cannot imagine how this could be done) made me want to revisit the book.Images from the world of Gormenghast have remained with me for years, long after others have faded. The book, I would warn, is not an easy read but the rewards are great. Peake had been compared with Dickens, Tolkein, and Poe. I would add Kafka to the list as well."
5,Excelent Book,"Learn to remember anything including names, facts, foreign lanqueges, etc. A must read."
5,Revisiting past reads,"I originally read this book many (many) years ago and had lost track of it and wanted to re-read. So, I did the most natural thing to do -- find it on Amazon. And, as they say, the rest is history. Received it and enjoyed it the second time around. Amazon and their partners in products have not disappointed me yet -- (knock on wood)."
4,Give this to your friends!,"After I read this book, I was afraid that my brain would fill up with all the new information I was suddenly remembering!Through a system of visual linkages, Lorayne teaches a technique for remembering names, numbers, dates and even lists of objects. The phoenetic linkages for numbers enables you to memorise telephone numbers, bank note serial numbers and addresses with very little effort. I only wish I had this book when I was learning the Periodic Table at school!Lorayne has a few other books out on a similar topic and he has also released a few books on Magic. He occasionally appears on television, where he memorises the names of the entire studio audience and memorises packs of cards. Inspirational!"
3,The board book lacks the impact of the full-size editions!,"I bought this a few years ago on the strength of all the good reviews on amazon.com, but my toddler/pre-school daughter never really liked the book much, and the illustrations never grabbed her. This year I bought the Jan Brett Christmas Treasury--a collection of her winter and Christmas stories--even though I was sorry that The Mitten was a duplicate. Then I discovered what a difference the format makes! The illustrations on 11 x 11-inch pages are eye-popping and reveal the story so much better. And what the description here doesn't tell you is that the text in the board book is *abridged,* which simplifies the story line to a bare minimum and doesn't connect the illustrations together as well. Spring for the hardbound full-size or used paperback full-size, or spend not much more for the many books in the Christmas Treasury and you'll get a better read for your money!"
1,"Beautiful illustrations, but this re-telling kills the beauty in the story","I ordered this because I was having difficulty finding the original THE MITTEN from my childhood. This re-telling kills the beautiful original message of giving and sharing. In the original, the cricket invites all of the animals into the mitten out of kindness--it's the coldest day of the winter and she feels sorry for them. In this version, each of the animals feels ""bullied"" into letting the next animal in out of fear. Ugly! And what a terrible message in this day and age, when bullying is such an issue. I would never recommend this book when the original is still available. And something about the simpler drawings in the original allows the story to truly shine, as it should. This version is pretty, but hollow."
5,Minnesota,Arrived in excellent shape and I gave as a Christmas gift. They were excited to get this book as a gift.
5,"The Mitten, by Jan Brett","I bought this book for my grandson. It was one of his father's favorite books when he was a child. I'm sure Nicholas will love it as much as his dad. Thank you, Jan Brett, most amazing author (one of my favorites!)."
4,Very good illustrations with a good story,"I personally don't like Jan Brett's illustrations and this story in particular. However, the children who I have read this story to all loved it. Your kids preschool aged child will love this story."
4,The Mitten,"A boy named Nicki asks his grandmother to make him white mittens. When he loses one he looks all over for it but can't seem to find it. While he doesn't know it but animals are making a home in the mitten, but are eventually are forced out by the pressure. Nicki finds the mitten and his grandmother is happy."
3,Beautiful artwork!,"I love the artwork in this book, and I am tempted to buy all of Jan Brett's other books for that reason. BUT my 15 month old has no interest in this book; maybe she'll like it better when she gets older."
4,Not an improvement over the Alvin Tresselt classic,"A pedestrian re-telling of a classic story, overwhelmed by an elaborate drawing style that is too realistic to complement this fanciful tale."
5,Beautiful book!,"My daughter loves to look at the pictures in this book. She is too young to understand the story, but there's so much to see! This is a great story that I remember from my own childhood. I am sure she willl enjoy it for years to come!"
5,Beautifully illustrated book!,"My 18-month-old sons love this book. I have to read this one to them over and over ~~ they love the bright colorful pictures. They love hearing about the animals. And I love reading it to them. It's fun and pleasurable on the eyes as well.Nicki wants a pair of white mittens and his Baba agrees to make it for him. However, he loses one and a mole decided to rest in the white mitten lying on the snow. He soon is joined by a rabbit, a fox, hedgehog, badger, owl, a bear and a tiny mouse. It's hilarious to imagine all of them in one tiny little mitten ~~ and so fun to read too!I recommend Brett's books for everyone. She's a wonderful story-teller and her art is beautifully-illustrated. She is an example of how children's books should be!2-4-04"
5,The Mitten-- A Wonderful Folk Tale for All Ages,"Jan Brett's beautiful and intricately detailed illustrations bring this Ukranian folk tale to life! In the story, a young boy drops a white mitten in the snow. One by one, various animals squeeze into the warm mitten to keep warm, and every time, the mitten stretches even more. Finally, a small animal moves in, and causes another animal to sneeze, sending the entire group flying from the mitten! Later, Nikki finds his mitten, and hurries home to his grandma, whose expression is the best, as she looks at the stretched mitten! Wonderful story, but evern more wonderful illustrations!"
3,Beautiful illustrations do most of the story-telling,"I must say, I truly do love the illustrations and artwork of Jan Brett. She is gifted in that area and I'm not going to argue that. What I will argue is that Jan Brett does a pretty darn good job telling a sweet story just through the beautiful images. The colors are bright and beautiful and that group of woodland creatures is just adorable. However... the story is not quite up to other retellings I have heard. Simply, the voice of the story does not match the illustrations and that makes for the biggest flaw."
4,"Great book, one of Brett's classics","This is a retelling of a classic folktale about a boy who loses his mitten. As he plays, all sorts of animals squeeze in, until finally they burst out.One of Brett's strengths is in the detail she crams into every page. For example, in this book the sidebar of every left-hand page shows how the boy, Nicki, accidentally dislodges the next animal to go visit his mitten, and on the right-hand page the sidebar shows that animal running towards the mitten.Unfortunately, I'm not certain that the level of detail Brett goes into is particularly well-suited for board books. The text is simple enough for a very young child to sit through and understand, but all the same, you might be better off waiting until they're old enough for a real copy of this book. (Especially if a previous commenter is correct and this version is abridged from the original!)"
1,NOT a hardback as listed!,"This book is listed as a hardcover but it is actually a BOARDBOOK, (every single page is made of cardboard.) This version is for a toddler. It is not what it says it is!"
5,Jan Brett is a 5 star author!,"Like her other books, ""The Mitten"" is delightful. Jan Brett's illustrations are bright and captivating. The story is simply and engagingly told. All children love Jan Brett books."
3,Dated but still contains some useful information on collaborative concepts,"This book is very dated now and the product-specific sections and case-studies do not hold much relevance in today's world. However the first third of the book does provide a good introduction to the (non-product specific) underlying concepts and theory behind collaborative solutions such as Email, Workflow, Document Management etc."
2,outdated old fashion,"this book has very stuctured designs but on the plus side it did have a few good pages on techniques, the page for the cake was awful looking and a few pages of dried looking wreaths was outdated , there was a few golden nuggets of designs and for the used book price its worth it but doesn't have any modern fresh designs chek out the publication dates that will give you a clue to how old the designs are."
3,A bit disappointing,"Maybe I should have been tipped off by the cover but I found the arrangements in the book quite old fashioned and too structured. I much prefer ""Simply Elegant Flowers"" by Michael George which I find to be more contemporary, both in it's arrangements and book layout."
1,Also had problems,"I also used this mixer for mixing powder drinks with milk. I had problems after a few months with the metal blade shaft seizing up, and eventually flakes of what appeared to be metal started showing up in the milk."
1,Throw-away,"We received this hand blender as a gift and were very happy with it until the gear that drives the blade shaft stripped out it is apparently a cheap plastic gear. If that one part were made better the thing would probably be a nice appliance. I tried the Oster service center and couldn't even get a replacement part. The guy on the phone said that most of the hand blenders were purchased on a ""throw-away basis"". It would be nice if they would advertise that fact. ""Buy this blender and throw it away a few months later!"" They probably wouldn't sell to well."
2,practical but short lived,"I used the blender for a few years. I liked it until the plastic part that holds the blade cracked and let the blade loose. I guess it is a blender with a short life-span. If you need something long lasting, don't buy it. If you don't mind replacing it every 2 or 4 years, then it is a very practical and versatile tool."
2,Oster Blender 2609,"I bought this item on a promotion at Kroger, and have been happy with it so far: Haven't run into the short life span noted by others. - Yet. - A notable incompetence with the design is a semi-sealed hollow space immediately behind the blades. Food will get into there and PUTRIFY. You need to design it so it is either completely sealed, or easy to get in and clean, or not there at all. Why don't designers think and learn? Is this the first immersion blender ever made, or is this well into the 21st century? Yet they are still coming out with the equivalent of cars with square wheels -- not because they work, but because they SELL."
1,Not reliable product. Overheating. Do not purchase.,"Used this product approximately 110 times for light mixing (egg whites). It started smelling slightly hot after about 50 uses, then quit blending totally, probably due to a bad motor or excess friction on the shaft, which was usually hot to the touch after use.UPDATETo be fair - customer service has sent a free replacement unit which is the same model. So far, it seems to be working OK."
1,It went to the dump,"The lower end is made of such a low melting plastic that it immediately distorted when used to blend hot soups. Eventually, the plastic end jammed against the blade, and that was the end of it. It was obvious from the first time I used it that the distortion problem would keep getting worse."
4,Great for smoothies and sauces,I have had this for 6 months and it works great for sauces and smoothies. It is a good investment for a light weight 2 speed blender. If you want a heavy duty blender go for a more expensive one. This one is great for my blending needs.
2,button use makes hand hurt,"You have to press buttons in really hard and after a minute or so your hand begins to hurt. I had to use both hands to keep the thing upright. As soon as you let off a tiny bit of pressure (even when you think you are pressing button) it shuts off. You have to move your thumb aroung the rubber gray cover to try to find where the button is located to get it to work. Not easy to use at all. While looking at the other reviews, I made the decison to return this product back to Kroger (on clearance for $16). Lately, my bargains aren't turning out to be very useful!"
1,dinah,"Returned this item. The switch is recessed beneath a soft rubber covering. There must have been something wrong because you had to search with your finger to locate where to depress to make it work. I picked it because it had variable speeds which also made the blender heavier. The distribution of the weight and the handle design and trying to depress the button I needed to use two hands. If you think about it, who is holding the pot you are working with. Sorry Oster. In my opion you failed this time and I have purchased numerous other small appliances because of the quality."
2,"Does a great job blending, until it breaks","It worked really well for occasional use over a few years. Then one day it broke and never worked again. That seems to be a common occurrence. Great for the price, but not high quality."
5,Excellent song,"This is a great song! Very catchy, great beat and excellent lyrics. Makes you wanna move. Definitely worth the price. What a fantastic debut!"
4,Great new artist,"This single is really good. It's nice to hear a ""pop"" artist who can really sing and actually has some talent. I'm looking forward to the album."
5,grand,I can really relate to Pink. It sounds like she has had a relationship like the one I am in now. she rally hits the hot spots.
2,"In the Heat of Passion, - Movie",The opening scene shows a graphic violent rape. Although it is shown to be a scene from a movie being filmed it was a turn off right from the start. I don't think most people would enjoy seeing such a violent introduction. It was not for me. I had seen hot steamy excerpts form this movie but that opening scene was revolting and left me not caring to see the rest of it.
4,Loved this book.,I thoroughly enjoy referring to this book. I am new in the sonographic realm and fine this book to be most helpful. Thank you
4,Relief for Addicted Churches,"The book has been a good tool to direct my thinking about the addictions in my churches (2). I knew something was wrong, but did not categorize it like an addiction. I am hopeful that more books of this type will offer help with the systemic problems of dying and declining churches. Thanks for the resource!"
5,Endpiece for Christians,"Every truly great read has an exciting ending. The last chapter is where it all comes together.Yet most who daily read the most popular book in the world, have never comprehended the last chapter, the Book of Revelation.""Becoming Empire"" identifies hundreds of 'hyper-links' in the text of Revelation to the preceding books of holy scriptures. The veil lifts, and the reader begins to see and hear not fictions of starwars, but God moving through history and pointing to the here and now.Today is the battle, and God's children are in the front lines. The whole Bible, understood, is their map to victory."
4,"Very Good, but where is the dubbed version?","This episode was one of the better ones. The scene where Eva 01 and Eva 02 fight while falling down a shaft is really impressive. I don't know what the big deal is about Nagisa, he has a total of about five minutes of film time and maybe twenty lines. While I watched this movie in the subtitled version, I would like to see the dubbed version available for order (as the rest of my videos are in dubbed version, too.) Even though Amazon.com has an option to buy the dubbed version, they sent me the subtitled. That's not what I bought! What's up with that? On the whole, though, a very nice episode."
5,the most powerful episode of EVA ever....,I must say that ep. 24 is my absolute favorite episode of this series....Kaoru has always been my favorite character and that feeling is reinforces every time I see it......I think it helps give an even greater depth of feeling to Shinji....And the scene where Adam is ......well...no spoilers for you guys....you'll have to see it for yourselves!!!!!!^_^;
5,Kaouru is a dyke!,"They don't need stupid dykes in Anime. I liked it though, i also found that shinji is not secure in his man hood.Dykes are evil, and Asuka was naked, except shadows covered anything interesting."
2,CRAPPY MOVIE VERSION,"I was so excited to see this movie when i finished the book, i rent it and got so disappointed. They don't follow the story very good, they skip important parts and it sucked.. i just hated it i thought it was such an insulto to great Mary Higgins Clark's book we'll meet again. if they are going to make movies out of her book, they should respect her. So, stick witht he book, dont see this crappy movie. sucks!"
4,A real inside look at the surgeon's life,"Richard Karl has done an admirable job of letting the reader into the rather rarified atmosphere of a surgeon's daily life. Also admirable is the compassion he feels for his patients and for the young doctors he teaches who are contemplating surgery as a career. With just the right amount of detail to give a good picture of complicated medical cases, the lay person can begin to understand the enormous responsibility a surgeon carries every day.I am a high school librarian and I will buy this book for my high school library, as I believe many students, especially those aimed at medicine as a career, would definitely appreciate this very readable and enjoyable memoir."
5,"An important, magical book","There have been a few fairly important books in the last few years that talk about what it's like to be a doctor or surgeon, but none as good as this. In simple, straightforward language, Karl talks honestly about the life of a surgeon. Not just in the operating room, but how being a surgeon (and in some cases, as he writes in one chapter, a patient) can make you understand the sheer magic of the human body and how it heals. If you've ever had to have surgery, you'll wish you had been able to read this book before meeting with your surgeon. You'd be well advised to read this book if you ever think you'll need surgery. You'll get a real sense of how a good surgeon thinks, and hopefully, you'll be able to communicate that much more effectively your own needs so that a surgeon will do best by you. But this is a perfect for anyone who just wants to know how a surgeon lives his or her life in and out of the operating room."
3,NOT FOR ME,"I wish I had purchased the stronger massager. My hair is too thick for this to do much good, so sort of a waste for me. I should have spent more and gotten only one rather than 3 of something I cannot use."
2,not for short hair,I like a stiff massage but this will tear up a bald or nearly bald head and that's all I've got to say about that. Except that I'm old enough to remember when a plastic device like this would have cost about 25 cents.
3,"Works OK, but lacking in overall quality.","Works ok. The quality is not as good as the old ""Goody"" brushes I was using, but works very adequately.."
4,Scalp brush,Was everything it was advertised to be. Have used one for years to care for hair and scalp.Good service. The item shipped quickly.
2,Rather Light Weight,"Not a value item, be aware its lightweight and maybe worth cents, not the price. Sometimes the bargain is not a bargain."
5,Scalp Massagers....,"This is a plastic scalp brush used to shampoo your hair and massage your scalp. It's plastic and will/should last forever. Some like it, others done. I found it was fine. The more the lather of shampoo, the ""softer"" this thing felt. But, it ultimately comes down to how much pressure you use when using this device. I actually like this and still use them to this day."
4,What happened to all the sources?,"I could no longer find the brush locally and so went on the internet to find the shampoo brush. The design of this one with a full loop for the handle was not what I preferred but I have it as a back up so when the one I normally use gets toothless, I will have a back up."
2,Petroleum Overpriced,"This brush is alright for what it needs to do, and for the $.99 price, but this company charges you almost $10 for shipping, which I didn't notice until too late. I don't even know if this is the right place to write that, but don't be fooled either way!Originally I wanted this brush for my no-poo (no-shampoo) regime, and so far it has helped to keep the tangles away, but also my hair has dried out...not sure whether to blame that on the brush.This is the only alternative I could find for a vegan brush, because the boar brushes that are recommended for no-poo are made from actual wild boar bristle."
2,"The Photo Showed 4, I got One","This product is what I wanted... except that I was expecting several of it. I mean, these are CHEAP PLASTIC gizmo's that must cost less than 10 cents to produce apiece, yet the charge plus exorbitant shipping costs made it a very expensive purchase for what I got.The ONLY reason I bought it online was because I couldn't find it in any of my local drug stores -- where I would have probably spent about $1.25 for it.Be aware when you order it, despite the photo showing four of them... you will only get one, and you will pay through the nose for shipping."
1,CHEATED !!!!!!,"I ordered this and received ONLY ONE for $5.00 WAY too much forShampoo Scalp Massage Brush- 1 Brushjust one. The picture shows four. I got only a yellow one. Where are my green, blue and brown ones??? I want all FOUR!!!! I feel cheated....."
3,I think Goody is still better..,"Goody used to make a product like this. I lost my last one and emailed to see if they still made it and to find out where to obtain one. They do still make them but are only sold in a few places. They passed the info on and sent a free one along. The product number is 01629. The item shown is nice, a bit stiffer than the goody product ( I tried both), but shipping is very high. The goody distributor will send as many as you want for ten bucks. I believe the per item cost is one seventy nine."
3,Shampoo scalp brush,"The brush is almost impossible to find in the marketplace so I was delighted to find this. However, paying almost $9.00 in shipping and handling for 3 such small and lightweight items seemed like gouging to me. I will not buy from Cache Beauty Supply again."
3,If you like it a little on the rough side...,"This device is a little bit stiffer plastic than I hoped and can hurt when you use it on your scalp. It definitely creates the suds in the shower though. With a little less pressure on it, it gets the job done."
3,Shampoo Brush,"This was not quite up to expectations. Very flimsy and cheaply made; however, it was also inexpensive so I guess the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" is true in this case.Items arrived quickly and I have no complaints on that score, but would upgrade for the next like purchase."
3,Not what I expected.,"I thought this would be a lot more exceptional, for the total price of 7.77. It doe the job, but from the picture, I thought there would be more than one included. I would not buy from this seller again."
3,"Visually, one of the weirdest books I own.","In fact one would almost think it's a computer book from the cover but this is -really- a book about ancient metrics. I came across a reference to this book in one of John Michells' books, and in fact if you happen to like John Michell, Graham Hancock or Colin Wilson then this book may also be of interest to you.80% of the book is about ancient weights, measures and coinage. The remaining 20% are Lenzen's theories about the location of Atlantis, the secret room in the Great Pyramid and an ancient civilization where the unified system of metrics comes from. The book has a lot of illustrations, is about 100 pages with large type and can be read in one afternoon. Lenzen is concise and to the point and often times I found myself wishing he had elaborated more. He let's the math and relationships speak for themselves and let's the reader draw their own conclusions about his work.Overall a fun, quick read if the ancient past interests you."
1,No thank you,I believe the sage and juniper in the top notes ruin this for me. They seems to affect every other note in the fragrance like the plague. I do not find a hint of citrus in this like so many other people seem to be able to.
3,1968 was a good year,"I'm 51, and I consider myself moderately stylish. Sorry to step on any toes, but this fragrance would certainly not be considered stylish in today's culture. When it was created in 1968, I suspect it was at the top of its class. But times have changed. I have Puig's Quorum Silver and wear it during the day. I really enjoy its masculine, spicy cedar notes. However, Agua Brava comes at you from a completely different direction. It's a very heavy scent, something that harkens back to the Bonanza / Brady Bunch era, with strong woody, musk, and sage notes. If that's your preference, then Agua Brava is the one for you. However, if you want to distance yourself from your grandfather's fragrances, or father's for that matter, you might want to go with something a bit more modern."
3,Left Wanting More,"I really did enjoy the book, and I liked how it was split into sections for each daughter. The rape scene didnt bother me as much as it bothered other readers, mainly because it is so factual. I rather enjoyed the book. The only thing that I didnt like about the book was that the girls' stories seemed to be cut so short. By the time she got to Junia, it seemed the shortest. I was really wanting to know more about how Averil faired out. I guess I just didnt feel like the closing of each girls story was enough. I think it is a book worth reading though."
1,Pretty disappointing,"I like all of Bertrice Small's early books. This one...not so much.The first story was ""ok"" but convenient & predictable killing off the character Mary.2nd story was just silly and senseless.Couldn't get through story 3 because I didn't like the female character through the first 2 stories.I lost interest.I always try to read through a whole book even if I'm not crazy about it. This one went directly into the ""to be recycled"" bin before completion."
4,Okay for a romance novel,"I thought that the novel would have more about the Arthurian Legend. The second section of the novel did; but, it was mainly about Lancelot and the Lady of the Lake."
4,My First,"This was my first Bertrice Small book and I thought it was a very good book. My favorite character was Averil, her story was the best. I found Maia to be a bit whiny, but her hero Emrys was so cool! At first I was very disgusted with the rape of Junia, but when you think about it, it's very historically acurate. Most of the women in that time period had to endure rape, especially from their own husbands! And the fact that these women rise above their curcumstances and remain brave makes them heros in my heart."
1,Unauthorized and unwatchable,"First of all, let me say that I am a huge fan of David Bowie's. I own all of his CDs, have seen him in concert six times, and have followed his career for thirty years. This DVD is a rip off. It consists primarily of middle-aged people who knew Bowie way back when reminiscing. No music of David Bowie's is featured in this release. No concert footage is featured on this DVD. What you will see are old school chums talking about David trying to get everyone to play baseball with equipment provided by the American Embassy.The only material of interest is in the interview footage of John ""Hutch"" Hutchinson, who performed with Bowie before and during the Spider from Mars's era. Other than Hutch, there's nothing positive to be said about this release, it is poorly produced, and extremely overpriced."
1,I am appalled by this book.,"I read The Mystical Life of Jesus many years ago. I purchased it ""shrink wrapped"" in plastic. Upon opening the book, I found a portrait of Jesus, under which appeared the words, JESUS, THE ARYAN GENTILE. This struck me as quite odd indeed! Still, that didn't prepare me for the nonsense I was to encounter throughout this book. Basically, the claim is made that Jesus was, after all, a great teacher (AVATAR) of mankind, but according to this book he was, most definitely, NOT Jewish. According to the book, all of the world's true teachers of Wisdom are, necessarily, men of pure Aryan blood. Does anyone recognize anything familiar in such statements? I find such statements racist and revoltingly anti-Semitic. THE MYSTICAL LIFE OF JESUS struck me as the product of the occult, and it's racist claims of pure aryan blood, etc., as well as the Swastikas and other occult symbols which pepper it's pages, remind me of Nazi-ism. Let the reader be wa! rned."
2,"Not impressed, sad to say","Mr. Lewis has a lot of really wonderful things to say, and I happen to believe much of it to be accurate. However, he does not deliver at all in the area of proof. Now, it is one thing if a person is speculating, or hypothesizing...but Mr Lewis continually states there are 'records' and 'documents' that prove what he is saying, yet he never shares any of it with the reader. I find this to be more than frustrating. Honestly, I have little respect for authors or people in general who do this sort of thing. Either state it is speculation, or provide proof that one states they have. It is obvious that the leaving out of this supposed proof is intentional. As I said, I happen to believe much of what he states is true (due to other books I have read over the years that do a much better job), I just don't like the way he handles it at all."
4,"""Fictionalized"" History","De Rosa's work certainly is a chillingly vivid account of the 1916 Easter uprising in Ireland. While other books that I have read deal only with the events in Dublin, this book goes quite a bit further and describes such events as the sailing of the Aud, the German arms shipment boat, and the fruitless attempt to create a military force out of Irish POW's held in Germany. The major portions of this book, which are based on fact, are written admirably. However, de Rosa's attempt to ""fictionalize"" history goes way too far, and subtracts a star from what could have been a five-star rating. Some of these fictions include unnecessary detail about Sir Roger Casement's homosexuality, and the vivid portrayals of cruelty which seem to be obvious creations of de Rosa's imagination."
3,What's with all the made up conversations?,"This is a great story, one of history's most inspiring, but a lame book. The author's attempt to turn history into novel is pointless and distracting. The only thing that makes this book tolerable, in fact, is that even horrible telling of the story can't completely overshadow the amazing facts. Let the facts speak for themselves and don't fill page after page with labored, made up conversations that just make the protagonists sound like idiots. There are much better books on the Easter Rising that stick to the history and avoid the nonsense."
2,I've had better,These cards were just okay. I've ordered other hand made type cards on-line before that were MUCH better. The bonus cards were horrible.
3,Greeting cards,"I order sets of greeting cards online regularly and I would rate these as ""average"". Nothing spectacular and certainly not as nice as several others but they are a good bargain if you send a lot of cards and like for the cards to be unusual and not ""cookie cutter""."
5,Comida Loca Green Chile Chicken Soup Base,"I found this soup base a few years ago and just love it! The Comida Loca company is out of Alburquerque and if you like a spicy soup, try their Green Chile Chicken Soup. In the ready to make package, it had bits of potato and you add in chicken and diced tomatoes. I like the soup base a lot! I use chicken stock when making it and often add a variety of veggies and chicken or shrimp. It is very popular with dinner guests . .and relatively low in calories! It is fast to prepare and you can water it down if you don't want it toooooooo spicy! I was really delighted to be able to get it through Amazon as it is invariably sold out a lot of the time at other sources.Comida Loca Green Chile Chicken Soup Base, 6-Ounce Unit, (Pack of 6)"
2,VERY Slow Paced,"Notice to all insomniacs: watch this film. You will be cured!!! Seriously, the pace is extremely slow. My wife and I both appreciate slow paced films, especially foreign movies, that gradually reveal sublteties that most other movies do not. While the slow pace of this film produces some rewards, the length of the film (nearly 2 hrs) was not worth the meager rewards of this adaptation of Gabriel-Garcia Marquez's book."
1,A Disappointing New Mexico History,"History is defined as a chronological record of significant events, and most important, including an explanation of their causes, i.e., the cultural and economic dynamics that impacted the events as well as the natural environment in which the event took place. The author misses by not mentioning the ""hows"", ""whats"" and ""whys"", or the forces that shaped New Mexico history. Also, a particular omission in the text is the role played by water or the lack of water that impacted the cultures of the indigenous Indians as well as the new Spanish immigrants."
5,Quiet Storm,"This Set has Great Slow-Jams.Many Great Talents Here.Marvin Gaye,The Temptations,Barry White Really Shine.Teddy Pendergrass also Has a great Song Here Turn Off The Lights."
1,listened once,"Please do not buy, this sucks, big time. Save your pennies. Threw this away right away! So bad I had to write a review!"
5,Fantastic publication!,"For students of the Bible who are curious about the Ten Lost Tribes, this is an excellent resource. The symbols for the twelve tribes of Israel are associated with the symbols of Celto-Saxons. A great read!"
5,Diagnostic Heraldry,"Another tool to find the lost sheep of the House of Israel Jesus spoke of in Matthew 15:24 and 10:5,6.The Covenant people that spread Christianity throughout the Nations.They are not who you think they are."
3,Contents,"This is just a 60 minutes collection of 1990-1991 interviews of the band during the ""Hot In The Shade"" and ""Revenge"" periods.

2,meh,"I don't know, I couldn't get through it. The first chapter was so sad, with its description of the author teasing and excluding her baby sister (and the baby sadly turning away and sucking her thumb in response... aw!) that I put it down and didn't come back to it."
1,Buyers BEWARE WILL NOT WORK ON PSP + 4gb Memory Stick,"I bought this game for my kid, i have a 4gb Memory Stick, and running on Firmware 3.03. it will simply not save saying that i don't have a memory stick or 128k to save on. Is a HUGE BUG, that is not being addressed properly either by sony nor Lucas Arts.Temp FIX, find a damn working saved game on the net and use it."
2,Fun at first but boring,This game is very fun at first but as you get to episode 6 you want it to be over. When you finish the game their is nothing to do but unlock things and free play.Its like playing all over again. The first Lego star Wars game was way better.
5,A better choice,"This game is easy to play. My son is only 7 and he has a PSP, most of the games for this device are very complex for a 7 year old to understand. This one isn't. This game has held his interest for over a year."
4,Great fun for all ages.,"You might think this is a kids game (and indeed, I bought it so my kids would have something to play on my PSP), but its great fun for all ages, thanks to a witty element that affectionately pokes fun at the Star Wars we all know and love.When you shoot (or slap) Stormtroopers they fall to (lego) bits, the facial expressions are not always the same. Princess Leila scowl is wonderful. The short Darth Vader is a funny, too.The game is not overly simple, either, requiring you to work out the next steps, which may require different actions (building controls, switching characters, getting across gaps, disassembling baddies), but equally (even on the PSP) it's easy to control and never frustrating.I guess if you hate Star Wars on principle, you might not enjoy this gun, but I doubt even that.It's the only computer game I've ever played that makes me chuckle as I play it.... and, yes, the kids love it, too!"
4,Fun-Fun-Fun,Bought this game thinking I'd take a break from long storyline type games. Ended up playing this longer than most other games. The Star Wars stories are precise and playing within the levels is just plain FUN. You want to find all the hidden areas. I'd say buy it for the fun factor alone.
4,Exactly what he wanted,I bought this game for my son's 7th Birthday and it was a slam dunk. We are huge Star Wars Fans... all the characters are in the game. The different levels keep him interested and he looks forward to what is next. The only down side is that I have to force him to turn it off. I am very happy that I got this game for him. It is a must!
5,EXCELLENT GAME FOR KIDS....,MY SON IS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS LEGO STAR WARS GAME.IS A EXCELLENT GAME AND THE PRICE IS VERY GOOD.RECOMENDED TO ALL.
1,Noodles are not as described!,"The description for these noodles is ""Wide rice stick noodles are typically used to make Kee Mao (drunken noodles) or pad siew. They are 3/8"" wide, and after soaking get about 1/2"" wide. Aside from being wide, they are identical to the more common but thinner rice stick used to make the famous ""Pad Thai""....The noodles should be soaked in warm (hot to the touch) water for about an hour or so depending on your preference.""These are NOT the wide noodles for Pad Siew. We tried soaking these noodles in warm water, but after about 45 minutes, they just dissolved and disintegrated into the water!!! They DID NOT EXPAND! I bought these noodles specifically because the description notes they are NOT the pad thai noodles - but they ARE! They are the same thickness (i.e. NOT thick) as pad thai noodles and I could have bought this same package at my local asian store, and NOT waited for shipping!VERY disappointed, will not purchase from this seller again."
5,A reference Book,"A very good reference book in mathematics, I have already thefirst Edition and the second one is even better. theyhave corect some misprinted pages in the euklidiangeometry.The analytical geometry section is perfect.Tensors are not included but I ask too much .I recomented it for everyone who loves mathematics."
5,Never Took Geometry in High School... At the Public Library I took it!,"This book is amazing. With clear illustrations and very logical proofs, it can help someone like me who never took geometry (I took my GED test in Washington State back when it required very little math) understand the essentials and do well in Trigonometry. This book is an essential for someone attempting to understand every step of the calculations they are performing, and understanding negates the need for memorization! :D"
5,Okidata 5200N,"I did not purchase the refurbished one, but I did purchase a new one after seeing the quality of prints from a local print shop (who has 2 or 3). This is by far the best color printer I have ever seen. When you print at full quality, It even produces a glossy magazine quality shine to the paper. Now this is a laser printer, not a photo printer. But I have printed many pictures for our school newspaper (I am a business teacher) and the quality was great."
5,a must read...,"a very difficult topic to cover, but one which is broadly researched and well presented."
1,author is a mal adjusted adult,The author of this book is a mal adjusted adult. Parenting and marriage was not one of her successes in her own life. She would not be an advisor one should believe or follow.
5,Should be required reading for all parents to be,"I wish I could praise this book enough. I stayed up very late many nights because of the compelling content. All people considering having children should read this book to make them better parent BEFORE the fact. It simply confirmed everything that I ""knew"" in my heart... we need to intervene with our children from the moment we even consider having sex... and also that we need to totally re-vision what we want our society to be. At the rate we are going, we will sink faster than the Titanic and the toll will be greater than we could ever imagine."
4,Not an Easy Read - Very Dense,"This is not easy reading - not so much for the content - as for the writing style. This is more a report of studies done on young child abuse and its ramifications in the manner of a professional, medical report. The information fascinating, just be prepared to work at reading it. 'Course, the content can be hard to take, too."
2,Outdated and Alarmist,"It is obvious why a new edition of this book has not been released. The predicted ""youth crimewave"" never materialized. This book can provide some valuable insight into the development of a young mind and the supposed damage that certain environmental factors may or may not have on a child's development. The text reads much like an episode of America's Most Wanted, dramatic and alarmist. They would have been much better off just citing the statistics in a journal article than force one to ""sort"" through the needlessly wordy chapters.They do bring to light some important and often overlooked factors in the development of a child that may lead to violence later in life (prenatal exposure to teratogenic substances for example) but they also reflect the mistaken perception that the answer to these troubled children, whom we as a society produce, is incarceration and criminalization."
2,Water Damage to Book,"There was lots of water damage to the book, possibly do to lack of proper packaging and the storm that hit during the shipping time. It was also on the longer end of the shipping time-frame; probably about 12 days."
2,poor quality,"I should have listened to the other reviews, sent back after 2 days. do not consider without buying additional speakers"
4,Better then I expected,"For the price and value it is really worth the money. I brought it for a summer cottage and just wanted something for the rainy days, I got more then I expected. I have to agree with most other reviews the sound is not the best but is easy to compensate with some external speakers."
1,set doesn't turn on,Had the same problem others mention. After 2.5 years the set won't turn on until I've pushed the power button 30 or more times.Olevia said the fix will be $210.Local repair man said possibly $135....but likely higher. What a waste.Will go with a top brand name next time.
4,Great TV for the price. Perfect size for small rooms.,"Great tv, especially for the bedroom, any small room or to use as a monitor. Only one small setback. If you use straight cable (not digital) you can need to go thru another device, such as a DVR or perhaps a new VCR that uses S-cable to hook into the TV.UPDATE: The HDMI cable works great. However, after disconnecting the TV to temporary set it up as a computer monitor - the TV has developed problems. When you attempt (thru the DVR) to change the channel or use the remote it shuts off. The picture is still great, but it is annoying to turn on the tv everytime you attempt to change a channel or a setting. I am currently using it as an external monitor for my laptop only. At most a 3 star product after 3 - 4 months of usage."
2,Eh?,"I agree with H. Schlossberg. Poor and erratic volume is a big issue. Mine is mounted on the kitchen wall, so external speakers are not an option. Proves the adage ""you get what you pay for."" In all fairness, I am waiting to hook up TV to cable box via HDMI, but based on performance via standard coax cable, I should have spent the money for a brand LCD HD. Research and think hard before buying."
2,Horrible Sound,"I bought this tv mostly due to its slim wall mountable profile. I expected it to act fine on its own as tv. However, the sound is absolutely horrible... like the tv is inside a tin can. I want the sleek appearance of an LCD... without ugly computer speakers hanging off the side. Caveat emptor... they might as well call this one an LCD monitor with built in non-HD tuner."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND,"After less than a year my TV lost sound and picture. It should have still been under warranty, but Syntax (the manufacturer) was of absolutely no help. Don't let the price of this TV entice you like it did me. Pay a little more and get a TV that will last longer."
5,Exceeded my expectations.,"After owning a standard definition tv my whole life this tv was a huge leap up. It has an absolutely superb picture quality, especially when it is hooked up to an Xbox 360. Gears of War and Halo 3 on this tv make my old lcd monitor look like my old tv in comparison. I am in love with this tv.I hadn't really noticed the sound issue until i tried it with some 2.1 speakers, then I noticed it big time. The sound is not the buying point on this television, but for the price the 1080i picture quality definitely makes up for it."
3,NOT CABLE READYY,"I received the TV in Fine working condition and fast too! The only problem I have is that there is no co-axial port on the TV, so unless you have digital cable, a VCR or DVD player, or just want to use it as a nice computer monitor this is the TV for you. Great value. But you must have seen my face when I opened the box and I couldn't connect my direct cable to the TV. I'm sending it back today."
4,Not Bad,"For the price, this TV is pretty impossible to beat. It has HDMI with HDCP, an increasingly important feature. Picture quality is so-so. It's no plasma, but it scales well enough. HD looks really good. Regular DVDs, not so much. Build quality is up to snuff, but it makes a clicking sound at regular intervals that drives me crazy. Speaker quality is truly abysmal. Do yourself a favor and pick up a pair of computer speakers to go with the TV if you get it. I wish it had a digital tuner, but TVs don't come with those smaller than 26""."
4,"Good deal, just buy it!","Pros:Great picture with 360HDMIVGAHeadphone inputNice size for my roomThe overall Menu systemGreat picture quality when using componentIt's thinGreat viewing angle!Cons:the remote, the remote, the remote! It's long and ugly!PS2 using composite cables doesn't look that good on itHD ready which means no HD Tuner...the only audio output on this TV is the heeadphone inputStandard def TV is mediocre on it, as with all HD's...Should have more connectionsOverall:This is my first LCD TV and it does everything I need it to do with greatness. Nice size, nice viewing angle, and overall it looks great with my 360! You all should just go ahead and buy it. It is worth every penny! I think this TV should really be like $500."
1,No go without a cable box!,"This unit does not have a coaxial (RF) connection, so if you don't use a cable box (basic and basic+ service users will not have a box) you wont be using this TV."
2,Short timer.,"I owned one of these for several hours yesterday. Easy to set up, it only weighs about 24 pounds. However.........I wasn't impressed by the picture. Standard broadcast looked odd, DVD was worse, and the HD signal via my digital cable box wasn't as good as the same HD signal,viewed on my 36 inch standard Toshiba.Back to the box, back to the drawing board for me."
4,Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict - Season One,It just arrived and I haven't watched the movie yet.I also hate when it is required on how many words I have to say to rate a product.
3,A Different Roddenberry Series,"Compared to Gene Roddenberry's long list of SciFi series, this one is very different. EFC is high tech with a definite mysticism feel. Season 1 does do a very good job of putting together the characters, theme, and plot quickly. Most series take 2 or 3 seasons to develop. The sets are kind of hokey. I found myself taking in all the twists and turns of the characters and story. And I waited for them all to be tied in. The season end cliff hanger is very good. Comparing EFC to Next Generation, DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise, EFC is at the bottom of this list."
4,Good series but then look who started it.,"Ok! I admit I'm a sci-fi nut and try to watch even the clunkers once (even if I have to fast forward;-)Earth Final Conflict, IS a good sci-fi series. As with most of Roddenberry's stuff it's sci-fi with the characters showing they are more than just actors moving around a set. There are really good graphics considering the time they were made and story lines that twist and turn like a good novel.The above reviews metion the legal battles, but I prefer to stick with the series. I had seen parts of the show when it was on TV, but it was nice to see things in order and complete. (much easier to follow the sometime twisted plot lines as some of the main chars come and go and come back...Personally I ordered all five seasons (even though season 3 is somewhat costly)... Not sorry I got them all while they are still available."
4,Earth Final Conflict : A great concept,"Earth Final Conflict has such a good premise. You can tell that this is a production done on a shoestring budget. Some of the actors are pretty good, too. I don't know whether the word is cheesy or campy to describe this Season One or EFC. at any rate, I adore Gene Roddenberry and respect what he was doing in the script. Also, keep in mind that this DVD series is 12 years old as of 2009."
4,"Finally, but a bit disappointing","As with many other fans, I have the ADV release of seasons 3,4 & 5. I was disappointed that after the dust settled with who really owned the rights to season 1 & 2, the winner released season 1 in full screen and only stereo. The 3 seasons from ADV are in widescreen and dolby 5.1. The resolution on the ADV seasons also look cleaner. I wonder how long we'll have to wait for season 2 to complete our sets."
5,One of the best,"From my viewpoint, this series is second only to Babylon Five in being the best sci-fi series made. Now I'll be holding my breath till they release Season 2, since I've owned the last three seasons for several years."
4,Can't miss it!!,I saw this on tv and lked all episodes. Gene Roddenberry did it again! - he will be remembered as the King Midas of Sci Fi.
5,Earth Final Conflict- Season 1,"Total Recall 2070This season takes you through the labyrinth of organized sophistication. The season one is about dispersement of technology; whose got it and who does not! Under the disguise of two races, each etching out their similarities, modifying, and in the continuum: synchronized extending peril."
1,Video is just OK,"I have several concerns with this video compared to other instructional DVDs. This may sound silly, but listening to the instructor with this bizarre Polish accent made me want to shut of the volume. I also felt the exercises were kind of ""goofy"" to say the least! There are better options out there by far!"
4,Good as I remembered,"This was as good as I remembered from childhood, maybe even better I appreciate it more now. This should be on a classic list...very funny!"
3,"Hey, Charlie, Lighten Up On `Number Three!'","These Sidney Toler ""Monogram"" Chan films, the last in the series, don't measure up to Warner Oland's earlier efforts but they are still very entertaining to me. Even with Mantan Moreland, who probably offends the sensibilities of a lot of people with his scared black-man routine. I can see where that's offensive, but if you just take him as a comedian and let it go, you can enjoy and even laugh with him.The only thing I did NOT find amusing in here, but I normally do, is Charlie's insults to his kid. In this film, Tolder insults ""Number Three Son"" (Benson Fong) so many times that it borders on downright mean-spiritedness.Anyway, it was still a ""decent"" combination of mystery and comedy and the ending was cool, with Chan and his assistants chasing the bad guys around a ""fun house."" All the Charlie Chan movies are entertaining."
3,Serial Villain Reunion,"I knew I was going to have fun with this film just from seeing some of the names in the credits. Cy Kendall was the king of the rackets in the first Green Hornet serial. Anthony Warde was Killer Kane to Buster Crabbe's Buck Rogers in the single Buck serial. And John Davidson, who has a nice turn here as two creepy twins, was the Ghost in one of the Dick Tracy serials.Plus there's I. Stanford Jolley,who was in every single B-movie and serial ever made (well, most of them, anyway).Chan investigates a locked-room murder, chases some McGuffins in the form of cat statues, and ends up battling the bad guys in a gloomy fun-house. A minor but enjoyable B-feature, and not so long that it overstays its welcome."
3,Charlie solves an old murder,"Yep Charlie (Sidney Toler) is on the trail of a cold case murder. His nosing around invokes more murder and mayhem. There is even a closed-room murder. We know how it was done. But the question is why.There are several overlapping story threads. And the Chinese cat(S) turnout to be sculptures. We get to see Charlie's number three son Tommy (Benson Fong) always putting his foot in his mouth and stumbling into trouble. However he can be pretty tough when the chips are down. The real comic relief is Birmingham Brown, Taxi Driver (Mantan Moreland.)Benson Fong was in several Chan's and acted well in over 50 films including Flower Drum Song (1961)Charlie Chan in the Secret Service"
3,Another Great Mystery Solved,"Although these Charlie Chan films were low budget, the producers did a lot with a little. You have to like classic movies to enjoy these. As a kid i saw them all and thought nothing of it. Now they impress me. Graphic violence is at minimum. You don't need splatter when you have a good film. Considered ""B"" pictures, these films are better than a lot of what passes for entertainment today."
1,How can a non-native speaker be used to provide Spanish audio?,"I was VERY disappointed with this CD. Many of the reviews on this site seemed to suggest that this is a very worthwhile CD and I was excited to use it in conjunction with other materials to boost my children's Spanish (I am bilingual). However, the CD is boring and the Spanish is spoken very poorly. What a shame to introduce Spanish with a non-native speaker. I definitely would suggest that people look elsewhere for audio introductions and exposure to Spanish."
4,A good deal for low budget buyer,"Navfly NV-900 in general can lock onto satellites in less than two minutes depending on the environment. It provides some nice features, such as selection between fastest time or shortest routes, warning you for speeding, calculating destination distance and adding via points etc. It's a good practice to check the Itinerary function first to see the turns and street names before driving. When entering address, the smart keyboard entry is definitely a plus for time saving.Though the battery capacity is large, be sure to turn off the device when not in use. Otherwise the device will still be drawing some amount of current in the standby mode. Once the battery is low, you need to reset the device with the stylus.In all, this is a handy gadget for driving."
3,ok,"This is a ok cologne the smell is too familiar and is not that strong and is small bottle considering that if you spray alot of cologne comes out, good for begginers"
2,Lame,My cologne smelt good but it had a leak and was all gone like three weeks after receiving the item it was kinda a bummer.
1,Hollister cologne Jake 1.7 ml- HORRIBLE PRICE,"Awesome cologne.. HORRIBLE price.. the REGULAR price at hollister is 38.00 for the 1.7 ml, and 30.00 for the 1.0 ml..."
1,"Too strong, doesn't last, not a great scent.","This is really just a bad cologne in all ways. It has a wood scent that from a distance isn't too bad, but isn't amazing either. Close up that scent is too strong and there's a slight scent that isn't very pleasant.. like rubbing alcohol."
4,Good for its intended purpose,"This bag is great for carrying a 17"" laptop and books for a few classes. Last semester I took three classes and it fit all my books with no problem. Taking a full load this semester and it will not accomodate all the books needed so I may have to go with a rolling catalog case. Going to class with a couple of drinks and snacks saves me money from having to hit the concessions or the vending machines so the insulated pockets are outstanding. Love this bag! I gave it four stars because after half a year of use I'm noticing the right strap is starting to fray a little bit. Nothing drastic."
3,Not Great,"The Feren backpack is very wide and awkward when full of heavy things. I also think that it is far less attractive in person than the pictures make it look. The small pocket designed for food storage is a waste of space. It would be far more useful if it had a place inside for pencils and pens in addition to the places in the middle pocket. As I said, it's a bulky bag, but if you have a very large laptop (17""), this is probably the average size of any laptop backpack that you'll find. I recommend looking at amazon's other bags before committing to buy this one."
1,Disappointed,"I should have listened to some of the negative reviews...This picture looks nothing like what I was sent...It looks like it is soft and fleecy, however, its fur is made of that cheap polyester fiber. Quality comparable to something you would win at a carnival...The ears aren't tinged with grey, they have a smudge of blue dye at the tips that looks like ink was spilled on it and then an attempt was made to wash it off. The fake suede on the underside of the ears was stuck on itself and when I peeled it apart the ear stayed bent. Tried brushing it out to make it look better and the fur was pulling right out. Oh look at the tag...made in China...I should have guessed as much."
2,A far cry from the doggie pictured,"I've ordered from Amazon for years and consider myself a very satisfied customer. This toy is my first return. I opened the box and thought they'd sent me a mop head. I actually thought someone had mistakenly sent the wrong thing. Nope. Looking nothing like the picture, i opened the clear wrap and examined a matted flat noodle furred ugly stuffed toy that looked like something i would have found at a laundry mat. Used. Left behind by a customers child. (you get the idea)I had read the reviews on site, and most seemed to be elated with their buy, but if they got the same thing that i received, i feel bad, as they must not be used to getting much. Gund used to have quality items, and maybe this was just an exception, or maybe i got a defecto dog. At any rate, thanks Amazon for your great return policy which will enable me to pick out something else for a special little girl."
1,dis toy is for saps,"i try to play with this toy but its fur fells like something ugly. it is very borring. all it does is sit in a corner. it is very stiff and cant be hugged. dont buy this ""fluffy puppy"" because it isnt fluffy and its not a puppy!!"
5,Sacred Messages in the Night,"This is an excellent book for those who wish to explore the realms of dreams. Scott writes with his usual ease and is easy to understand. This book is unlike the countless dream dictionaries which demand you follow their interpretation. It also gives you insight into the history of dreaming and its uses in history. I especially enjoyed the roles of dream interpreters in history and the ideas of the divine transmitting messages through our dreams. It can help you to better understand the very personal meanings behind your dreams. This book has also been recently republished under the title "" Dreaming the Divine: Techniques for Sacred Sleep "". Then again, if you are a fan of Scott Cunningham, its worth having the originals in your collection."
5,Renewal,"I recently received a copy of your new book, ""Soul Gardening"". Enthused would be an understatement. I could not put it down and even now as I write I am eager to return to its pages! Bravo! I have been looking for some time to have a book compel me, and voila; Soul Gardening appears. I want to go work in the garden, take rest on my Adirondacks, read your reflections and let the work of my hands baptize its pages. It is an honest, earthy, spiritually insightful book that needs its special shelf among the plants and tools of my garden and my soul. I love it."
5,A perfect read -- I was undone by the iris,"There are such gorgeous and tantalizing life stories masquerading as garden stories told in this book. I was capitaved and 'undone by the iris' so much that I have read that chapter aloud to at least two friends who were awed to tears. It is a book that bears reading and re-reading, and reminds us to take time to smell the roses, take time to connect with the earth, and take time for yourself. I will linger in the garden and feed my soul! A perfect read."
1,"matlock is a fake, yeah sure enough, he read 6 books in one day.","John gunny matlock is a fake, yeah sure enough, he read 6 books in one day. right I bet.this review system is a joke, if some guy can just review any book and give it five stars. just look at some the titles he has read, gardening and interior design to ips and c++."
3,Andy Sidaris Colection Vol 1,"These dvds are good ""B"" movies and would be great for showings in the drive-ins."
3,Low Water Pressure,"The Moen aerator, although more expensive than some off-the-rack aerators, is less useful. This aerator limits water pressure excessively, compared to cheaper less graceful aerators. There may be a trick to ""modifying"" this aerator."
4,installation critical,"I purchased the Moen 20200 Swing 'n' Spray Aerator in 8/12. I immediately saw what one of the previous reviewers had meant, when the unit exploded off the faucet and went flying around the room. Going back to basics, I tried, after finding all the parts all over the kitchen, to reinstall it. I found that you must tighten the unit A LOT, using pliers, until when you turn it on all leaks around the unit stop. After that, it works just fine."
2,Moen faucet Sprayer Aerator,"I thought this sprayer was a brushed finish,( but it is chrome,) and that is why I paid twice as much for the Moen---I thought since I have a Moen faucet it should match. But alas. The only saving grace is that it stays in spray mode until you push it back up into stream, and that is much better and practical. The other types automatically go back into stream mode when the water presser is lowered. But it is still too expensive."
4,"Evolutionary Psychology, Art, and Science","This is a good book for a beginner, e.g., an undergraduate student in philosophy, psychology, or art. It can provide some solid basic understanding of the issues involved in interpreting and reproducing the world(s) around us. The book's thesis is that we are hard-wired by the process of evolution to interpret the world a certain way and that same process limits the kinds of art and science we are able to create. Those already familiar with this thesis will find little that is new in this book. Also, I was a bit disappointed that the book contained only black and white illustrations, it would seem that the subject matter chosen cries out for some color. The topics covered in the book are diverse and hang together loosely, which can be a challenge to a reader accustomed to a more focused and sustained discussion."
1,Not for Beginners,"Too advanced for a beginner. There is a man showing modified poses, but they are still too difficult for a newbie. In some poses, like locus, the camera does not show the man.Not all the poses are safe for someone with severe pain. Be careful what you try."
1,Total Crap - Unless You're Already Super Flexible and Know Yoga,This video for beginners is NOT for beginners at all. It already assumes you know Yoga lingo and that your body is amazingly flexible. She doesn't explain anything and the yoga workout is very difficult to follow if you're a beginner who has never tried this before. This did not help my back at all. Very disappointing.
1,This is not the DVD you're looking for,"As another reviewer said, the, ""Better Together: Buy this DVD with The Office"" is extremely misleading. The Office is an excellent British television programme, and Cold Feet is an excellent British television programme, BUT THIS DVD IS NOT IT! You can buy the DVDs of the British television programme Cold Feet from amazon.co.uk.Reviewer rating:Five stars for Cold Feet the British television programmeOne star for Amazon trying to make you buy the wong DVD by mistake."
3,cool movie,"I recommend this movie to men afraid of marrying and women naive to some men and the way they live and think, not all men just some men. Overall cool movie."
5,Elizebeth Swann,"I received this as a birthday gift and it's great. Elizabeth's outfit is nice and accuratly detailed like in the movie and she has eight points of articulation. Her hat isn't removable but that's okay because I don't have to worry about it falling off and getting lost.Her face doesn't look exactly like Keira Knightly, but there is still some resemblance. Elizabeth comes with two gray/silver swords that fit in both her hands. My only complaint is that the swords can't be stored in her bandolier. That can be kind of annoying but it's not a big problem. The back of the package has information about Elizabeth and a picture of her in a scene from the movie. I have seven Pirates of the Caribbean figures (including Elizabeth) and they are all great. If you like Pirates of the Caribbean you should definetly get this! It's well worth your money!"
5,Frank's History of Jewish Philosophy,"A well written text on the complexities of historical Jewish philosophers and their philosophies. The text looks at each period in light of the historical events happening and the philosophies of other religions that were happening around it. As with any in depth study of philosophy, it is not an easy read, but certainly an excellent text on it's difficult subject."
3,Not exactly my cup of tea,"Not exactly my cup of tea. I thought, hey why not, no one I know has started this series and it looks pretty good. Well that's just what it is, a pretty good series. But I'll collect it, since I have books 1-3, It has an alright story and I like the turn around in book 3. Any NORMAL manga reading girl will probably love it, though.Don't pass it up till you read a bit of it yourself, who knows, you'll probably love it.A good series to pick up when you have to wait for the next volumes of your beloved, favorite series. LOL"
2,It broke,"The plastic things that hold it up broke and now niether spawn nor cygor sit on their metal poles. I have to buy epoxxy so I can glue them on, boooo. I don't understand why they have those plastic things in the first place, the metal poles should go inside of the toy itself. oh well..."
1,I'd been cheated,The Yonex Mavis 350 list price is $9 per 1/2 dozen and Amazon is selling $13. I bought it a week ago and really feeling very bad about it. I thought Amazon is always giving us good price but not this time.The quality of 350 is good but I cannot convince the others I am playing with to change from feather to plastic. It is a little too fast for them. But I like it and I bought the yellow ones so it is much easier to see under the white light and white background. The real plus side is that it is really durable. Feather cannot even last 1/2 a game.
1,Very Expensive,"Yonex Mavis 350 shuttlecocks are only $8.50 per half dozen at most other onlilne stores, $12 price is very expensive. Also with the $9.90 S&H; is way too expensive.In most cases I buy 12 tubes at $8 (discount rate) from one of the other online store and they ship it free.My advice to anyone who needs shuttlecock is to search (Google) for the cheapest price."
3,Marvis 350,"Good product! Last longest compare to others that I have. However, the speed is slow. Shipping kinna slow, feel like waiting forever."
3,Good for casual play,"The speed of this shuttlecock is faster than feather ones for sure. However since it lasts forever and it is relatively cheap, I would recommend it for people who only play casually. Definitely not recommended for people who takes the game seriously."
1,worst sevice,I only received two cans of Mavis 350 instead of 3 cans order.I called the vendor several times to send me one more can without any satisfaction. I am NOT very happy about your service at all.
5,Very durable,"Quite durable. For the feeling and speed, definitely it's different from leather ones. However, it's acceptable to me as a median-level player."
1,HORRIBLE HANDCUFFS,"I got these handcuffs for christmas and I have wanted them for a long time, but they broke and fell all apart with in 3 weeks of Christmas. I didnt even get a chance to play with them.. I will never buy them again at least not these ones."
1,Guaranteed to disappoint!,I ordered The Distinguished Racing Heritage of Porsche as well as Ferrari by Brentwood Home Video. Once I viewed these DVDs I realized how Brentwood chose their name.I would be ashamed to call these DVDs home videos. Their video quality is below that of most camcorders. The content is hokey and the music is reminisent of porn movies of the 70's.You've been warned!
2,Porsche DVD review,The narrator of this DVD sounded like a narcoleptic. The person would start giving out information about the cars and stop talking for a good 2 minutes while the camera zooomed in on the cars. When the vehicles were driven you could hardly hear the cars. Overall the DVD was informative but don't expect to be entertained.
3,not as bad as the other 4 say it is -,"The four latte slurping yuppies that found this so bad should consider that you don't get a ""Dreamworks"" type production with Clint Eastwood style direction and a Paul Newman level narrator for the price which they paid for this DVD.As a Porsche owner, driver, former sports car competitor in the early days of SCCA racing, and a continueing attending fan I found this DVD interesting, informative, and certainly nostalgic and well organized anddefinitely worth the price."
1,Had to return product,"The mix, when received, was long past its expiration date. We tried one box anyway but it would not cook properly"
1,WAY too expensive from this vendor,Buy the beignet mix from Cafe Du Monde directly. 4 boxes WITH shipping is only about $24 as opposed to almost $40 here.
3,Missing hardware,"This is a nice big baffle. I can't use it yet because the hardware was not in the package. Through Amazon i can either return it for a refund (ok, but I want this item) or exchange it (how do I know that the new one will have hardware? I'm not the only one who has had this problem). I took the advice of the other reviewer who is missing the hardware and contacted the manufacturer by email and am awaiting their reply."
1,Deceptive Item display,"The Dome is displayed with a bird feeder attached. The unsuspecting shopper looking into ""bird feeders"" would never suspect that the item was only a dome, not a feeder at all, just a cover for a feeder that must be purchased to make a bird feeder. I purchased as Christmas presents. Glad I did not ship directly to my friends. BUYER BEWARE"
2,Not worth the cost,"The ""Super Dome"" is a super disappointment. It took our squirrels exactly 2 hours to breach this dome. On to the next try at squirrel control."
2,Overpriced,"These are great for protecting your bird feeder and they are unobtrusive looking, but the squirrels have no problem getting on top of them. I do think they are way overpriced. I give them two stars for making it a little difficult for the squirrels and for protection, but the price is quite ridiculous."
5,The only one that works - I havetried lots!,"Seriously, this is the only one that works.Squirrels have figured out how to get around all the other baffles and contraptions I have tried.This is the only one that is wide enough, curved enough and slippery enough (which means it stays cleaner too).Anything less than 18inches just doesn't seem to work.Sure, this is pricey, but it also means that only the birds will get your feed. May even pay for itself in a couple of seasons!"
4,Long before holodecks.....,This episode takes you to a planet where the crew of the Enterprise is supposed to relax. They do everything but..Kirk and company are chased by the things they fear most. It's a planet who has a computer which can read people's most inner thoughts. It was interesting to see that McCoy came from a Southern background. Something I didn't know until watching the episode. It has a few tense moments...like McCoy getting jousted by a knight in armor. It was anther one of those supercomputers that alters reality thing....
3,Reasonable but overpriced book,"This is the textbook for an undergraduate math course in cryptography in my school, so it was forced on me. The author does a good job introducing the theory and background math, but I would say there are not enough examples worked out to understand how it is used. For instance, Chapter 2 on information theory and entropy was difficult for me and the treatment in the book was too abstract, with just one example cryptosystem worked out. Other than that, it is pretty good, and some sections are particularly well-written (eg on block ciphers, AES, etc). Only 3 stars since it's much too expensive!(considering this is only volume 1 <2 is in the works, if not completed yet> - what a rip-off scheme.)"
2,some really good sections but...,"** Covers all the essential areas (except random numbers).** This edition has alot of errors (typos mostly).** For a compsci guys the math is probably very detailed but for me (as a mathematician) I think he takes too much for granted.** Better than Schnier on cryptanalysis and attack mentality.** The section on linear cryptanalysis took along time to understand though, and the break came when I downloaded additional tutorials from the internet.** Very good section on AES.** The algorithm descriptions (in pseudocode) are terrible to read, they are next to unreadable actually. He uses unnecessary indices, and the code is often thrown right in your face without explaination.** The book is way too expensive, so at the end of the day I suggest students should be downloading the free e-book ""Handbook of Applied Cryptography"" instead... but if you work for a company with alot of money... this book is still pretty good."
2,not usable on android :(,"purchased this book only to find out that it is unusable on my android device. so i have to read it on my windows pc or go out and by another device. since the drm prevents me from printing, this one may be getting returned."
4,Back To The Basics!,"On this disc Buddy pays tribute to Skip James, Willie Dixon, John lee Hooker and others in this 12 track acoustic cover CD. It is a noble effort for Buddy and his vocals and guitar playing are in top form with guest appearances by Eric Clapton and BB King on a couple of tracks helping out on the guitar duties. There is nothing new here but what is here is certainly worthwhile listening. Personally, I think Buddy's acoustic release, ""Alone and Acoustic"" with Junior Wells is better but that is another review."
5,Mellow Piedmont Blues,"If you are looking for in your faces rocking blues don't buy this. If you want to hear what the blues is all about and where it came from, than get this now. This is a great addition to any blues collection. Buddy is paying homage to all those players who really lived the blues and paved the way for what we call the blues today. Simply a fantastic effort. If you like this, check out Bowling Green John Cephas. Another unsung hero to the peidmont blues."
4,For new fans,"If you are not familiar with country blues and you enjoy Buddy Guy, get this album. If I want to listen to country blues, I'll probably play Charley Patton or Robert Johnson more often than this CD, but it does a great favor for bringing new fans to the blues. And if you enjoy this album, then you can look for those who recorded the original versions, whom influenced Buddy himself. If someone thinks that Buddy would do an acoustic album of old country songs for marketing reasons, well, he doesnt know much about marketing."
4,Excellent,"I believe this book is an excellent read. I gave it 4 stars because the book felt rushed. I think that Danica, the main character, needed more to her. Unlike all the other characters I could not create an image of her in my mind. This book has also fewer detailed fighting scenes and, sadly, no vampires but I still recomend it. Enjoy."
3,Promising...,"In the beginning, I was not impressed. About a third of the way through, I though Atwater-Rhodes struck a vein of gold, but she let a promising detail go to waste.Some parts are interesting, particularly some of the more heated conversations between Zane and Danica. Overall, Zane is the best character in the book, although he has been criticized as being 'inconsistent,' I think that might be because the other characters are so one-dimensional, particularly Danica, whose aloofness is supposed to be a trait of her race. It was carried into the first-person narration, however, which did nothing for me.But it was a quick, fun read, and I would recommend it. I'm looking forward to Snakecharm, narrated by Zane."
5,WOW!,This book was one of the best I have ever read. I could not put it down. I was sad to reach the end I wanted the story to keep going. I pray there is a squeal in the works.
1,not good,"It seems that Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' writing gets worse with each book. My favorite of her books is 'Demon in my View', and 'Hawksong', by far, is the worst I've seen yet. She spent little time describing anything, and when she did acually describe it, I still couldn't picture it in my mind. The storyline was bland and linear, and the ending was horrible.I would not recommend this book."
5,Hawksong,"Hawksong is the first of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's books I've ever read, but it won't be the last. I thought the book was amazing. The storyline was great, I couldn't put it down (I read it in two days, that's how good it is). The message the story conveys is also amazing. They're just trying to do what they think and feel is right. The characters are like real, with real flaws and strong points, and their in a realistic world. The plot was rather Romeo and Juliet, but it also has a science-fiction/fantasy sort of twist to it. I can't really tell you much, or else that would give it away but I'm deffinently going to read Snakecharm, and her other books as soon as I have time."
5,Flying high,"Everyone must read this book about love, hate, challenges, and Shape shifters. The book Hawksong is really good. The Author is Ameila Atwater-Rhodes. There is a lot of people who don't like romance books, but most will like this one. In this book there are two types of shape shifters, Avian and serpents, although they are at war . Danica and Zane are the main characters. This book has a lot of love, hate, and war. This is a must read book.~Ashlie W.~"
5,I couldn't put it down!,I had to keep reading this book. When I finshished I was sad and read it 2 more times. You can never get tried of this book it's Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' best book yet!
4,Hawksong sings,"HAWKSONG is a wonderful fantasy novel, rich in imagination, vivid in images, entrancing in its characterization. It certainly well worth reading, even if you are no longer a young adult. Read more at www.midnightblood.com"
5,I LOVE this book!!,"I absoloutely LOVE this book! I've read all of Amelia Atwater-Rhode's book, and she's definately one of my favorite author's. I just couldn't put this book down, and I'm fixing to read it again! I finished it in 2 or 3 days, because I couldn't get enough of it!The plot is great... Danica, a shapeshifter (into hawks), is heir to the shapeshifter throne, and she'll do anything to stop the ongoing war between her people and the serpiente (snake people). She decides to marry the serpiente prince, but she has to convince both sides it's what she really wants, and the peace both heirs strives for is true.It's so great... and along with the plot, it even has some romance! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read! I loved it!"
2,Hawksong,"The book I read for my book report was Hawksong, by Amelia Atwater Rhodes. The main reason I really didn't enjoy this book was because at the beginning of the book their was a war between the Hawks and the Snakes (cobra's), and I don't enjoy wars at all and I very much dislike snakes. I also didn't like how the characters in the book were animals, and they could talk. When I read a book I usually like them to be non-fiction or fiction book without talking animals. Another reason I didn't enjoy this book was because the problems they had were unreasonable and didn't any sense to why they were in the book. I also didn't like how the author wrote the book in a third person perspective. I also thought that some of the events in the story could have been left out, because they had nothing to do with the book, and didn't affect the climax or the resolution in any way."
4,war and love,Hawksong is a tale of enemy kingdoms that are a war. Danica Shardae the queen of her kingdom is in a war with Zane and his kingdom. This war has been going on so long that no one remembers why it was started.For some reason though Zane wants to call the war over so he decides that Danica and him should go to a kingdom of neutral territory.The Queen there says that Zane and Danica should wed to bring peace to their lands.This book is all about their struggle to killing a war and finding love in their hearts for one another.I would recommend this book for people that like shape shifters. I loved this book.
4,Best book so far,"Amelia Atwater has shown us maturity with her new book Hawksong. The detail and beautifuly mastered plot kept me rereading this book over. I give this book four stars because, although it was one of the best books I have read for a while, I felt that there should have been more problems between the characters besides assasins, although that idea proved interesting. I also think the ending was too rushed for my taste, and she could have added more. Overall I think this was a great book and I cannot wait for it's sequal Snakecharm."
4,Polished and mesmerizing,"Atwater-Rhodes has a remarkable maturity in her writing that surpised me when I read this book. This is the first of her books that I have read, and I was drawn in from the first moment. The story is more about the characters and cultures than about plot, although there is still enough action going on to keep the reader interested. The whole of the book was absolutely fascinating. The conclusion was a little abrupt, but appropriate for the tale. This is a great piece of fantasy writing, and I cannot wait to see what else this young writer will come out with."
4,"Flawed, but good","Hawksong is a relatively good book. Danica, the sole heir to the throne of an avian nation, and Zane, the sole heir to the serpeite nation's throne, are married to try to bring peace to the two nations that had been warring for a long time. It is mostly about Danica and Zane trying to settle their difference and love each other.Sometimes Atwater-Rhodes is rather forced in her writing, which makes the entire book basically fall apart. The relationship is rather hurried along. But you must give her credit, it kept me interested and I read it several times, savoring the descriptions of the two nations.I would highly recommend this book."
5,Wonderful Must read,"I loved this book its turnd on the whole vampire thing which i liked but you know you want some new ""blood"" after an while and well amelia Atwater-Rhodes delivered. It was an amazing write and im still boggling the fact that shes so young and can write so well. This book reminds me sort of demon in my view but its still different. They have to try to grow to love eachother and maybe they wont or maybe they will(i'm not dsaying. but im really looking forward to her next book Snakecharms hopefully its a continueation of this book cause im still begging for more."
5,Rock Poet Extraordinaire,"Simply brilliant. It's not often you come across a writer who, with only a few words, can stop you dead in your tracks, take your breath away and give you something to think about for the rest of the day....well, here's one.Raslo's first collection can make you laugh and cry, but above all else his words make you think. If you've been through life's ups and downs, you'll find these poems really resonate. Do yourself a favour and buy this book - do your friends a favour and give them a copy. Everyone who reads this will have a favourite, mine is The second time I met Donn Deedon.Thank you, Raslo, for sharing your soul with us, for this is where your writings are from - and let's hope you continue to do so, we are enriched by the experience."
5,Raslo Layton: Rock Poet,"Brilliant poetry! Raslo has an extraordinary imagination and creativity to turn regular, everyday stuff into reading delight."
5,notes from the other side,Raslo will take your hand and lead you to drink from a different perspective. Here are grains of truth from other stories that bear a striking resemblance to your own. Feel the beat of the unshackled drummer.
5,One of the best albums of the 1990s,"I've picked up a few Muttons CDs on travels to New Zealand and Australia, and while all have their charms, I have to reserve my highest accolades for Envy Of Angels, which in my book is one of the best albums of the past decade. Nearly every song is a standout, and the CD as a whole is chock-full of those inspired pop moments that make everything feel better: the crescendo of harmonies in ""She's Been Talking"", the perfect bridges in ""Straight To Your Head"" and ""Like This Train"", the sneaky beauty of ""While You Sleep"", the slow fade-in on ""Envy Of Angels"". Simply inspired. Kiwis and Aussies have no excuse for not picking this one up; as for my fellow Americans, especially Crowded House fans, don't be afraid to take the leap--this is a masterpiece on a par with anything the Finn Brothers have ever done."
4,airsupply,bought it because Airsupply was coming to town and they played most every song and put on a great show.
5,Ultimate Air Supply,This item was a gift for my brother. He had a favorite song on there that he didn'thave with any of his 80's music. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition.
1,You Sorry Dogs,"You, just like iTunes, made ""Goodbye"" part of the album and not allowing a purchase of the song by itself.You guys stink!"
1,Enough with the best of cd's already...,How many best of compilations by Air Supply do we need!This cd didn't even include the good songs from the more recent cd's.I know. How about actually making a new record and then another and then another and then maybe a new best of cd.You just put one out a few years ago for crying out loud.why does the world need this one as well. And don't blame it on the record company either.NEW MATERIAL. I already know what the old stuff sounds like.Peace
3,Beware if you have long hair,"I like this jacket with 2 small exceptions. I found the fit to be a little too big, and the beading and details at the collar catch my hair. Otherwise, I really like this jacket - it's a very soft, pliable denim, the frayed detailing is very cute, as is the beading (done in silver and blue). I've also recieved lots of compliments when ever I wear it - I've just learned to wear my hair up whenever going out in this jacket."
3,Nice illustrations - but stories are too long and cryptic,Bought this book for my 3.5 yrs old son. He loves the pictures. But the stories are no way 'short-stories'. The language is too high-level for a preschooler and I have to explain the story in 'simple english' after reading a paragraph. Would have loved if the stories were made shorter and simpler keeping the wonderful illustrations as they are.
5,gallon drunk tonite....the singles bar,"A particularly good CD from Swamp Rock Legends,Gallon Drunk,whether Youre A Fan of The Band or,want to get a taste of Their Music,This CD is definetly for You,it contains Classics such as Draggin Along,Some Fools Mess and Several Bonus Live Tracks,A great CD by, A Great and Much underated Band."
5,Stanley Meyer: Unsung American Water Fuel Hero,"I walked the streets of Grove City, Ohio looking for a trace of it's native son inventor. Nothing! Passersby didn't know who he was. He'd been dead 7 years (1998), but wouldn't you think they'd have erected a statue or named a street after him or something, in view of the twenty-some years of his life that he dedicated to bringing us clean, renewable, free energy from water? And then they give almost $2 billion to the oil industry to look for hydrogen fuel technology! What a joke! Beam me up, Scotty, there's no intelligent life down here!"
4,An Overlooked Artist Of The 90s,"Sarah Jahn was marketed as a ""Christian"" artist, and as such, she ended up being overlooked. While her lyrics don't feature any swearing or sexual content and could be considered pretty tame, she's not exactly a preachy, Christian artist that one associates with the CCM industry.Jahn's music is Shawn Colvin meets Fiona Apple. Thoughtful lyrics with a husky voice and some grinding guitars in the background. I listened to this album so many times as a teenager that I'm surprised I didn't wear it completely out. It doesn't get played as much as it used to now, but I still revisit it occasionally because it's just great music."
4,The EDGE of music enjoyment!,"After listening to this recording, I found myself really liking the way that it was recorded! I'm not one of those people who judge music just by a few listens. However, I have been a follower of Christian Contempory Music for many,many years and this recording does not reflect that too me at all!(still I keep playing it because of its sound.)Anyway, I would recommend that anyone who likes their music on the ""edge"" of something kinda ""odd"" too go get this recording and add it too your collection. You won't be sorry that you have done that! Its in mine!!!"
3,God Bless America !,"I bought this for the Kate Smith tune, but soon realized, I had Much more ! Many songs I've heard all My Life at Parades and at Church. In this day and age We live in, this certainly lifts your spirits. I think this would be a very good basic ""CD"" for everyone to have in their collection, who is America minded !"
5,so. cal surf -n- drag done right finally !,"well i thought these guys from orange county were never going to do a follow up to their 2001 release the DYNOTONES ! but when i saw the cover art from the world famous ROCKIN JELLYBEAN from japan, i knew it was worth the wait. 14 smokin tracks with an enhanced vidio on the opening song done by piero of the mad fabricator dvd fame was just a sneak of what was to come. this disk opens with a link wray style grinder but moves nicely into some reverb drenched traditional surf, crunchy stomps, Ghoul surf ala ""the deadly ones"", fuzz numbers bobby fuller would be proud of,and a couple of swinging r and b style dittys sure to get your rear end movin. being that this thing is all over the vintage 60's map is why i gave it 5 stars to begin with. if you dig ventures,astronauts,lively ones,link wray,dick dale,drag raceing,frankie and annette bch movies bobby fuller,davey allen and the arrows, then this disk is a must have. file under BOSS ! !"
2,rather shallow,The book was based on a very clever idea. The joining of 4 authors dealing with the progression of recieving the gun that had changed their lives so drastically. The dissapointment was when each character instantly was drawn to a total stranger and became madly in love within hours.It was so unrealistic . I was amaised that one even went head over heals by merely being tied together. Really ! I found myself guessing which couple would get divorced first( since they all had barely a thing in commen ). I really hope that in the future the main people could be a little more real and a little more developed. I know that each author had limited pages but I know the potential was there . The skill was in the writing so why not in the characterization?
1,"Came with stains and bad sewing, doesn't have grommets","Everything is in the title. This product came with stains everywhere and a sewing job so awful the flag isn't rectangular.I uploaded some photos that you can view next to the product image.Oh, and it doesn't have grommets and the lines are not straight."
2,"Price is right, product was flawed, no customer service to back it up","The price and shipping were great on this product, however, the white portion of the flag had red bleeding into it. If you look at it, it is noticeably pink. We contacted the seller and they asked for a picture. We sent the picture and that was 3 weeks ago. No response. It's for my 11 year old who loves flags and although he noticed it and asked about it, he will still use it. I wouldn't ever display it for any official purpose due to the color. More disappointing is the lack of customer service from an Amazon allowed seller."
5,Vive la France!,"Our theme was ""A Night in Paris,"" and the flags gave an added touch. They were hung respectfully in the front of the hall, and looked really great. They arrived in perfect condition and earlier that expected. Great Job!"
5,Great product for a cheap price!,This flag is great for the cheap price I paid for it. I was looking for a flag to drape over my window and it fits perfectly.
4,Innovation and Awesomeness,"Great sophomore attempt by this upcoming star. A few of the songs on this CD are a bit too poppy and produced for my tastes (i.e. Self Portrait and Try So Hard) ""Anywhere"" captures best the beautiful writing and heartfelt simplicity of Stephanie's music. My favorite is ""Let Me Know"" for it's spirituality and storytelling."
4,Great mouse,"I purchased this mouse right after christmas and will say I love it! It is very smooth and helps keep my wrist from bothering me as much as before. Took a little while to adjust due to the fact you dont move it with your hand, but very easy to use and adjust too! Also has a lot of great features. I would recommend it highly!"
4,I use it at home! The speed is the greatest!,"I love the speed and the ease of use! It does take time to get used to it at first and I will never go back to a mouse without the wheel. My problem is, the track ball can sometimes be a little bit too sensitive, especially when doing delicate publishing or drawing. Great for general use! But for long time use, my wrist tends to go numb. The software even lets you change the direction of the track ball, ie, move the ball up and it goes in a strange angle - you can adjust for that."
5,OLE HENRIKSEN HERBAL DAY CREME,BEST CREME I HAVE EVER USED....IN FACT I USE IT MORNING AND EVENING...HAVE BOUGHT MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE CREMES BUT THIS ONE IS THE BEST OF ALL...SO HAPPY I RECEIVED A SAMPLE PACKET....HAVE BEEN USING IT EVER SINCE.
2,Not ideal for my skin,"It works ok on my dry skin, but nothing special. A littel oily/fatty. I also did not care for the strong smell. I won't purchase this product agian."
5,Fantastic,I saw this on HBO. I was very impress on the mini series. I work for a senior citizens organization and I would highly recommend anyone caring for Alzheimer patients or know someone who is.
5,A great program,"As a ""child"" of Alzheimer's - my father and all of his siblings died of the complications of Alzheimer's - and an Alzheimer's Caregiver Support Group,leader I have found this series, which I was able to preview at NIH, before it's release, is an importnat educational experience for anyone who is/may be dealing with the Alzheimer's world. I ordered two copies and will be sharing them with the members of our Support Group."
5,Awesome,This program is FANTASTIC to help kiddos work with their comprehension issues. The book is very user friendly and provides detailed examples of each Step. Nanci Bell is amazing!
2,SKIP IT!,"I'm a Joe Pesci fan, so although I'm familiar with these cheesy ""3 on 1"" types of DVD compilations, I rented it from my local video store. Very weak movies you have here. They are B-movies or TV movies from the 70's and they look as low budget as you can get.The first segment, ""Honor Thy Father"", was amateurish; although you expect cliches in a mob-themed movie, this one gave you all the bad cliches --badly submitted and badly portrayed by actors who seemed between guest appearances on ""Kojak"" or ""Baretta"".The second, ""Family Enforcer"", was the best of this bad lot. Needless to say, this was due to the efforts of Joe Pesci.The third and final movie, ""Mob War"", I gave up on after the first ten minutes. Rarely do I fail to see a movie all the way to its finish; however, after the first two I could see it was the same old story now getting worse by the minute. Off the DVD went, to be returned the very next day.Two stars for Joe Pesci's presence."
4,great,I use the card in my blackberry pearl. It works great and allows me to fully use the phone. The phone storage is rather low considering all the things the phone can do. I'm glad I made this purchase.
4,Great Service,"only reason it didnt get a 5-star is because I ordered 2 other memory cards at the same time and they both got to me 3 days before this one - other than that minor hiccup i have no complaints at all, fast service, product exactly as advertised."
4,Works file but I hoped this is like 'matrioshka',"I purchaced this item for my Sharp vodafone. (using Mini Disk)Disk itself works fine.If an SD adapter works for a Mini SD adapter, it would be perfect."
3,Gift for Girlfriend,"I bought this for my girlfriend. She has an older LG phone and wants to upgrade. She used it to store all her pics and audio. I believe she is happy with this products, and would definately buy more, if necessary."
2,Service was great - disk doesn't work,"The service was wonderful. Product came when promised. I was told to order this specific product for a program for my phone, but when I put the disk in my phone, it totally froze the phone."
1,Don't be fooled by the stated size,"I was very disappointed in the size of this pan, which was given as 16.6 x 8 x 3"". The pan I received was labeled with the same product number shown in the description (900585), but is very small. If you measure from handle to handle, the pan is about 14"" long, but the useful area is much smaller. I measured the inside dimensions of the bottom of this pan before returning it; it is closer to a 9.5 x 5.25 x 2.75"" pan. The sides of the pan do flare out, so is larger at the top (about 12 x 7""). The pan is very pretty - I will be looking for a larger pan in this style."
2,Scalloped Baking Dish - it's TINY !,I am VERY unhappy with the size of the casserole. It's too small! Too small for lasagna and that's what i needed it for. I watch sizes carefully on amazon bc sometimes they can be shifty. I didn't realize that they would measure from handle to handle and not indicate that in the description. I will think twice about ordering something that does not have a very good description again.
2,"Poor Packaging, Arrived Broken","I'm giving the 3-quart baker two stars because the color (marigold) was beautiful. However, due to insufficient packaging, it arrived broken. It was placed in a box with hard styrofoam at either end where the handles are. But there was nothing protecting the long sides of the piece, which is where mine was broken. I would have asked for a replacement, but with the same type of packaging I fear it would only defer the inevitable refund. (Had a similar incident with a baker from Macy's which arrived broken twice.)I generally like BIA products and I order from Amazon frequently with no problems. I am a little surprised at the packaging in this case, especially given the delicate nature of the sides of this baker."
2,Once you bake in it you will have a stain for life,Once you bake in these they stain and it will not come off so you can no longer use them oven to table.
4,Been working like a champ for 4 years,"Working just fine in a Jeep Wrangler that has the top down/off from March through November. No problems to date. Pushing 2 pair of Polk MoMo 5.25 from a Sony Marine head unit. Works just fine, and if by chance some creep decides to steal it....well, I won't be too pissed off. The small footprint works well in the Wrangler."
3,Bobby is not done justice here,"I'll be right up front, I'm not a big fan of the Kennedy's. That being said, there is much about Bobby that I really like. This miniseries is slow and not a very good production. There are too many gaps in the story and key folks are left out, such as Kenny O'Donnell. Though there are good actors in this film they seemed to be reaching to achieve their goals in performing as their roles would ask. I've watched the two major miniseries on the Kennedy's and by far this is the worst of the bunch. I was looking forward to seeing this."
5,Wrong Side Of Nowhere,"Well-written and well-researched book about a complex individual who could have had it all and ended up with nothing. I never would have heard of Blackie had it not been for this book, but after I was done reading it I had to ask myself, is this guy worthy of a book? Maybe not."
5,Antec OEM 13-Bay ATX Value Line Full Tower Case with 300W Po,Antec makes sturdy cases with no sharp edges. Their power supplys are reliable. Their 300W power supply (included) is popular with owners of AMD Athlon CPUs. This case also comes in black.
4,Interesting insight,"This is one of a series of books with quotes by and about ""The South's Great Generals."" A slim volume, it takes only a short time to read through.I enjoyed this collection of quotes, as much for what his Union enemy's said about Longstreet, as what he said himself. However, reading the quotes regarding the criticisms of Lee's Old Warhorse in the battle of Gettysburg are almost painful. Yet they had to be included to give as full a picture of the man and the soldier as can be done in so short a space.Readers and scholars of the War Between the States will enjoy this book, perhaps even keep it at hand to browse through at any time."
4,No hint of bitterness,"Little Dieter Needs to Fly is a tremendously uplifting movie. I was surprised that in his interviews, there is no animosity towards his captors, nor even a hint of bitterness in his voice. While he was treated inhumanely at the hands of his barbarous captors, he speaks matter-of-factly about his captivity, as if he were in school detention. His desire is only to fly again. It isn't the best movie about the POW/MIA experience (Return With Honor is), but it is definitely worth watching."
4,Very good story,I read the book and this documentary brought it to life.Very moving and I recommend it.However only one thing I didn't like about the documentary.The background music was a little strange.
5,Insight into Vietnam,"I once dated Dieter Dengler, but we were like ships passing in the night, as our lives crossed briefly. I can only remember his zest for life, his enthusiasm and determination to fly, and his unconquerable positive attitudes that obviously was the reason he made it thru such a horrific experience. See what it takes to be a winner."
5,Dieter Dengler's Escape from Captivity,"an inspiring story of courage and determination superbly told by Dengler and brilliantly filmed by Herzog. the Vietnam conflict and America's involvement in it evokes many disparate points of view; this film, and the story it tells, unites us all in our admiration for this brave airman."
4,Film Wings of Hope,"When I looked for the film ""Wings of Hope"" it was expressed that this is on the DVD ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly. As the film first mention ist from Werner Herzog, I thought this is correct.When I got the film, I was disapointed, that this was not the case. Furthermore the is no german sound on Little Dieter so that I gave it to my son."
3,"Mis-titled, but compelling tale","No one will argue with the subject's heroism. But his presence as a movie star is another matter. Dengler speaks in a rapid, nonstop monologue, with no breaths in between. It gets annoying real fast, not to mention the German accent like something out of Hogan's Heroes. His tale of survival is an astonishing one, later dramatized by Herzog in a big Hollywood movie. The title is unfortunate, however. Some may mistake this for a children's fairy tale. That it is not."
5,courage and strength,most people don't have the courage and strength that this man possessed. his courage to go forward under the most trying of times is simply AMAZING. this story should be an inspiration to everyone. it was to me.
5,One Of The Best Marketing Books I have Read,"I've read all of Peters' books, and Porter's and Built To Last, and they all are excellent. But Sergio's new book provides one of the best blueprints for actually marketing your product or service -- something the other books don't do. Some reviewers have taken him to task for being too simplistic, but his basic approach takes the magic out of the discipline and connects it to actual sales. That's not simplicity, it's business. Should be required reading for all marketing managers."
2,Nothing new under the sun (?),"I was tempted to give it a 3* because the tapes were spoken in a direct language, saying over and over again 'I regret nothing'. I think that was the best message. Identifying 'Marketing' with Coca Cola is certainly a funny, yet daring act. Content wise it is 0% fat milk but strangely enough somehow I found it easy to almost enjoy the tapes. Believe me, there is much worse out there than this one. Somehow I felt like I want to chat with the author a bit. He certainly knows much more than he tells on the tapes !! Now, that is marketing, isn't it ?! author"
5,Still the Number One guide to brand marketing,This book is a PRACTICAL guide to building multiple brands in the new world of marketing. It is a great reference to doing things differently and pushing the envelope.
2,"All common sense, nothing new, yet nicely launched","This book describes a basic marketing common sense that are nothing new to most senior marketing executives. Nevertheless, the launch of this book itself is a smart marketing. While it is only useful for young red blooded marketers, more experienced executives still could learn on how to make parity product like this one becomes the talk of the town."
2,title missleading,"I was disappointed after reading Sergio Zyman's book with the provocative title ""The End of Marketing as we Know it"". Old marketing based on mass merchandising with little attention to customer needs was dead years ago. What the author calls new marketing principles, have been practiced as early as the 1980's. As someone who has been a CEO and director of marketing of a number of businesses, and am now an adjunct professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute's School of Industrial Management, I found little new in the author's list of the principles of new marketing outlined in his last chapter. I am surprised that a book published in 1999 says so little about the impact and influence of the Internet in business to business and consumer marketing.Byron Menides August 14, 1999 Worcester, MA"
2,Disappointingly devoid of new insights,"I have great respect for the Coca-Cola marketing machine, but this book does not demonstrate that organization's genius. The book's title is a dishonest overstatement. The main thesis, ""marketing is about selling things, not about being cool,"" is hardly ""the end of marketing as we know it"" -- it's basic stuff any kid with a lemonade stand could tell you. Zyman tells some amusing war stories, but ultimately, he is not bringing anything new to the table. (Perhaps he's guarding the Coca Cola ""state secrets""?)If you need to be convinced that marketing is about selling things, or if you'd like to read Sergio Zyman's marketing memoirs, then buy this book. Otherwise, it's of little value."
1,Do not buy it,"Do not buy this book. All he does is assure you, in an arrogant way, that he was not fired by Coca Cola and that Diet Coke was not a mistake. The only message you will get is that Marketing should focus on increasing sales, but does not tell you how or give you any ideas."
4,Every marketer must read,"After more than 30 years as an advertising practioner I worried that this would be another rehash of the obvious. It's not. It does cover the usual ground but with exciting bumps and with an attitude that refreshes. If you think you are in the business of selling than this is a worthwhile read. If you work with, or in, advertising agencies you'll get your money's worth. db"
3,"BACK TO BASICS....ONE ON ONE, EYE BALL TO EYE BALL","REALLY NOTHING NEW....JUST OLD PRINCIPLES RENEWED.VERY GOOD BOOK, BUT TO THE NEWCOMER, ITS GOOD, TO WILLY LOMAN (DEATHOF A SALESMAN), IT IS OLD HAT, LONG FORGOTTON. DO WHAT WORKS, AND TO HECK WITH THE REST. ZYMAN PUTS THAT OLD PROVEN CRITERIA TO WORK, RE-INVENTING THE RIGHT METHOD. WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT ALL THE HYPE OF E-COMMERCE? HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BOOK, WITH RESERVATIONS TO WHOM."
4,Somebody Voices the Revolution,"Finally, somebody dares voice the sentiments I have been harboring for years. As a database marketing professional, all too often I see people get caught up in the soft marketing strategy and not pay enough attention to those of us who actually practice the science of marketing. Pearls of wisdom from somebody who practices this philosophy wholeheartedly. War stories are entertaining as well. This should be required reading for all marketing undergrads, MBA's, and marketing professionals. If you are a marketer and haven't read this book, consider yourself out of date!"
3,"It had some good points, but borrow it from the library.","I thought this book had some good points, but they were not really new. While I have included it to my library of books, I probably should have borrowed it first."
4,Insight,"Strip away some of the over indulgence and the infinite number of sentences ending with exclamation points, and you have a truly insightful business title for today's marketing professional. The focus is on profits, stupid, and on the marketers job to sell more products at higher prices and profits. An excellent tool for any marketer facing tough budget cuts, or the shifting sands of global competition."
2,This book was a big disappointment.,"This book was wholly unentertaining and poorly written. The principles and theories discussed within it seemed to be the products of common sense - I feel as though I could have come up with more innovative marketing ideas myself, and I'm not even in marketing!!! The writing style was very simplistic and boring. It was as though Mr. Zyman was trying to use unnecessary words just to fill space. All in all, I felt as though the time I spent reading this book was wasted, and I sincerely believe that I could have written a better one myself, simply based on my instincts as a consumer."
5,Engineering was all I knew until I read this book,"5 weeks ago I changed careers from electrical engineering to marketing. Until now, my only exposure to marketing has been a class I took 3 years ago in order to meet a grad school curriculum requirement. Mr. Zyman gives his readers a perspective that can't be taught in any classroom. The book is well written, easy to read, and not bogged down with a lot of boring graphs and industry terminology. The author never asks the reader to believe what he says on blind faith. Instead, he PROVES his points with personal experience. Although Zyman seems to ""toot his own horn"" at times, I don't get the sense that he wrote this book just so the world will know how great he his. I think he genuinely wants to be helpful. This book may be common sense to seasoned marketing professionals, but it's a great help to those of us just starting out. Don't throw away your marketing books, but do throw away the outdated ideas they sometimes teach."
1,"""Sailing the North Atlanic"" by (Titanic) Capt E Smith.",Monday morning quarterback. Rewriting the history of Coca Cola greatest disaster (so far) to blame - of all things - their ad agency (a typical marketers excuse when faced with failure). Blame the agency! This is written as a sad reflection of what could have been a great career - I have the feeling that Sergio's arrogance has been his undoing (more than once)as a marketing man. What do marketing failures do when they run out of steam? They write a book. Like this one. Some of Sergio's advice is good and to the point. But a little too idealistic - written with the benefit of hindsight. I will use some of his advice - the book is useful. I would recommend it particularly for marketing newcomers. Study Sergios screw ups and learn.
1,Obvious info written for simpletons,"Nothing at all new here to anyone who has been awake since 1980. Mostly boring stories about the old days at Coke, how great they were, blah, blah, blah. Zyman, it seems, had a perfect career, even the missteps were charmed. Worst part is that it's all surface here. No way to extrapolate the information to a real-world setting. So it ends up being just a bunch of old, not very entertaining, war stories. Avoid."
2,I must not get it...,"Obviously Mr. Zyman has expereinced a lot of sucess but his expalination is more appropriate for a pamphlet of the old days, not a full length book. I would suggest readers skim though chapters 1-9 and spend most of their time on chapter 10, it offers some excellent insights into bringing talent into an organization"
5,a helpful book,This book is wonderful and helpful. I read it right after reading Power Promoting! They both helped me with my business.
1,A no-brainer,"No genius this guy. The style of writing is ok - but let's be honest don't we know this? I mean, if you don't know that ""Marketing is a strategic activity and discipline focused on the endgame of getting more consumers to buy your product more often so that your company makes more money."", then get out of this line of work. Brain candy for no-brain chief executives who ""don't get this marketing thing"". Avoid."
3,A nice introduction,"I'm a beginning marketer with a lot riding on my department. This book was an excellent introduction to some very helpful themes in marketing, such as that all of it is all about sales! After reading Zyman's treatise, I feel ready to be effective and not emotional about my tactics. It was easy to read and accessible to the neophyte. I highly recommend it and keep it handy at work. It's a great resource. I was a little distracted by some of the typographical errors that made it to the printed copy. I think the quality of the printing undermined Mr. Zyman's hard work and excellent message."
4,This book is good.,"This book is really good when it comes to FINDING roller coasters, but the photos are not in color. It really is good by providing information on coasters. And, it's good for just browsing through."
5,Must have for coaster enthusiasts,"This is a great book. An absolute must have for coaster enthusiasts. Even for the casual coaster fan there is a wealth of information and great unbiased comparisons of roller coasters the world over. The only catch is that it current up to 1997, and there have been so many incredible coasters built since then. Regardless, this is still a wonderful point of reference.This book includes a history of roller coasters, lists of the top ten steel and wood coasters (as of 1997), a very full list of all the coasters in the world as of the printing, a top ten list of great amusement parks, and a trip planner that allows you to maximize your coaster experience anywhere in the United States."
4,Nice Italian Animation collection...,"It's nice to have these classic Bozzetto cartoons all in one tape, but they could've left the ORIGINAL Italian titles in place instead of the cheesy English ones wizzing past the camera. I gave it four stars [instead of five] because I remember seeing the first film 'Self Service' back in 1979, and this tape has a scene missing! Who knows what might've been cut out of the other cartoons?On the good side, it's great to have Bruno himself introduce himself, talk about his career & introduce some of the cartoons and many of these I'd never heard of before.A nice addition to anyone who likes Bozzetto or world-wide animation. Much of the material IS however aimed at Adults so please don't be one of those parents who 'buys it for their kids' because you'll have alot of 'explaining' to do afterwards!"
3,"fun video, serious message","If you like Zen master Seung Sahn's teaching style, you will probably like this video. A fun take on a traditional satsang video. For more depth, I recommend full length dharma talks."
4,The Tenth Planet - Mini Review,"One of the all time classic stories of Doctor Who finally makes it onto BBC video so how does it stand up? Pretty well actually. William Hartnell is an acquired taste, and the first appearence of the cybermen takes a bit of getting used to. However, this is a quintissential base under siege story and everything holds up pretty wellIt's a shame that part 4 is missing, but the restoration team have done a pretty good job of adding in all the extant footage and some telesnaps.All in all a story that should really be in any Doctor Who fans library."
2,Don't use with Garmin Nuvi 550,"Doesn't work well with the Garmin Nuvi 550. Only displays map data at the 10,000ft level, when you zoom in, you lose the map features."
2,Disappointed!,"The reason why I am disappointed in this movie is no closed captioning on it. I barely understand it without CC or English subtitle. I can speak for deaf and hard of hearing people, it is extremely frustrating for me when a studio doesn't produce it with CC or English subtitle. I know the movie is good but no CC."
5,ESTE LIBRO HA SIDO MI ÉXITO ECONOMICO,"ya que en él aprendí a HACER CREMAS, CHAMPÚES, JABONES, LIMPIADORES FACIALES, MASCARILLAS...¡de todo !Envaso los productos y los vendo a un precio razonable: Toda mi clientela SABE QUE LOS INGREDIENTES SON NATURALES, y lo primero que hacen es observar mi propio cutis, que es PERFECTO ( excepto por unas pequeñitas que no he podido remover ).Este libro me permitió pagarme el college y ahora, comprar mi ajuar de novia y colaborar con Alex para que podamos comprar una casita donde vivir ahora que nos casemos.LAS RECETAS SON BUENÍSIMAS Y YO MISMA LAS USO !Pruébelas aunque sea una sola vez: ¡NO VOLVERÁ A DESPERDICIAR SU DINERO EN COSMÉTICOS QUÍMICOS QUE JAMÁS FUNCIONAN IGUAL !"
5,Very Helpful,This book was actually suggested to me by the Rabbi teaching our Hebrew class. It was very easy to read and follow and helped greatly with my learning process.
2,Not the greatest workmanship,"Got the flag for Burns Supper decorations. Good quality material, but the workmanship left something to be desired."
5,Attention Parents!,"I actually found this book in a barber shop. The illustrations got the attention of my 2 year old. What a find! Every parent regardless of the age of their children should read this book at bed time. It had the attention of my four children, ages 2 to 10. I actually felt like I was reading my parents, and grandparents Christmas story. I was lucky enough to not have to live my life through rough times like this. I was able to have the education that my parents and grandparents worked so hard for, but only could dream of. This story helped me remember and appreciate all they had to endure. What a story it brought me back to my roots. Only warning I have for future readers... have tissues close at hand!"
1,Not worth it!!!!!!!,"This DVD is cost way too much, needless to say not even full seasons of shows like CatDog, Dinosaurs, Talespin, Sailor Moon etc. cost that much. Don't overprice cheap DVDs"
5,maintaining creative vitality,"Acclaimed singer Alanis Morissette, promoting her album Jagged Little Pill in 1995, reported feeling a ""dissonance in the midst of all the external success.. I was expected to be overjoyed by it, and at the same time I was disillusioned by it.""This kind of ""crisis of meaning"" - which many highly talented and creative people experience - is addressed in the book as a key element in depression.Psychotherapist and creativity coach Eric Maisel acknowledges that medication or biological treatment, as well as therapy may help in alleviating depression, but he emphasizes that ""Creators have trouble maintaining meaning... Not creating is depressing.""In addition to a number of perspectives and insights by artists, the book provides information and cognitive behavioral strategies from a variety of psychologists and creativity coaches to help deal with meaning crises that can erode creative expression and mental health."
4,Durable shoes,"The shoes seem to be good quality and durable. They clean easily because everything is, of course, waterproof. Versatile too because you can wear socks and they just look like cross trainers, or go barefoot for the sandal-like comfort. I'm happy with them."
4,great live album,"if you like strung out you should like this album. it comes off a bit raw like most live albums but I actually think it make some of their tunes sound better. strung outs music comes off a bit ""produced"" at times, considering they classify themselves in the punk/hardcore/faster music genre, I wouldnt really say hardcore but you get what I am talking about. this is just a solid album as far as live stuff goes."
4,Grrrreat live album,"Strung Out has always 'stuck out' in my mind when it comes to punk rock. They have tighter songs than most punk bands and also fade into hardcore/metal occasionally.Thier new album ""Live in a Dive"", is a perfect representation of what the band is and where they have come from. The album is live and you know it. There is something special on live albums of great live bands. Thier sound is tight, vocals are great, and the energy tips the richter scale. I've listened to all of Fat Wreck Chords' ""Live in a Dive"" albums so far and Strung Out's is probably the best. Every song is great, plus they have improved old ones as well. Never heard these guys, this is the perfect introduction.If Fat Wreck Chords keeps put em out, Ill keep buying and listening.AND SO SHOULD YOU."
2,Something happened,"""Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne,Poland"" is a controversial book whose reputation suffers the moreindependent research is done on it. Gross' number of 1600 victims has been reduced to 400 or less, as the mass graves were investigated by authorities with Rabbis standing by.(In comparison 3,000,000 Polish-Jews were killed in the rest of Poland by Nazis. Notably also 2,000,000 (half by Soviets) non-Jewish Poles died at the same time. How many at the hands of the hundreds of (well documented) Jewish Commissars? Probably many times more than 400.)By his own admission in recent interviews; Gross concludes that his exploration of the evidence was ""incomplete"", as the presence of German soldiers everywhere was brought out by witnesses some from as far away as Israel. What was the purpose of this book - one could speculate - self hatred?It's a narrowly (amateurishly) researched book, long on drama short on verity. Many exist significantly more broadly based."
2,This Mediocre Work was Actually Nominated for a Book Award,"It is incredible that a book whose thesis rests on a few non-eyewitnesses (one of them a pro-Soviet, anti-Polish Jewish Communist--Wassersteyn), and which is so soundly contradicted by other sources omitted by the author Gross, could be so highly acclaimed and even nominated for a Book Award. There is little doubt that it was the German Nazis, and not the local Poles, who murdered approximately 150-400 (not 1,600)local Jews by pushing them into a barn and then setting it on fire. Either the critics have somehow forgotten all of the standards for judging the accuracy of books that purport to deal with historic events, or there is some agenda afoot to blacken Poland's reputation. Perhaps this is part of the Holocaust Industry, in this case the attempt to extort ""reparations"" money from Poland (for further discussion of this, see the Jewish author, Norman Finkelstein, and his book, THE HOLOCAUST INDUSTRY)."
1,Ignores German Archives and Much Other Pertinent Data,"The information from German archives, totally ignored by Gross, together with other evidences likewise omitted by Gross, virtually establish the Germans and not the Poles as the perpetrators of the crime against Jews at Jedwabne. As for why books such as these are written, read the book (The Holocaust Industry) written by a courageous Jewish author, Norman Finkelstein."
1,"LACKING OBJECTIVITY...""200"" BODIES were EXHUMED RIDDLED with 100's of ""GERMAN"" BULLETS.","As I read this book, it seemed, at almost every turn, that it just didn't make much/any sense. As a History Major, I realized that this book has many incocsistencies/contradictions; especially, with Gross' previous ""Pro-Polish,"" writings. I feel the most objective and, intellectually calm, book that you can read on this topic is; ""The Massacre at Jedwabne: Before, During and After,"" by Marek Jan Chodakiewicz. Chodakiewicz' book is much better researched and written.Chodakiewicz' book, is... well...""believable."""
1,Based on undocumented facts- made up lies,"This assessment is based on a small amount of Polish Professors and their evaluations and judgments. After reading these opinions we come to the resolution that the exhumation was not allowed and suspended; therefore, only through this missing fact history can be explained and supported, unlike this book presents. This book mostly is used to darken the Pole image and put blame on them and not the real culprits - the Germans. One of these reviewing Professors is Jerzy Robert Nowak. The included links provide more information on this and other issues. ----- [...][...][...][...]"
1,Gross Misrepresentation,"As interesting as the book may or may not be, let alone the questionable methodology employed by Gross, I find the customer comments much more telling. I especially find interesting one writer's comment: ""although most of them can hardly express themselves they have seen fit to hurl insults at this wonderful book."" Is this just another case of argumentum ad hominem or simply a gross misunderstanding?Can't we all just get along!Finally, always remember that a sentence begins with a capitalized letter; it does come in handy if you are trying to express yourself."
2,Truly shocking but...,"""He was cringing, fighting the straps with amazing strength. His hands turned red and then white and the cords of the neck stood out like steel bands. The force of the electrical current was so powerful that his eyeballs popped out and rested on cheeks. Finally, he caught the fire. His brain was boiling.""Shocking?This is the description of the sufferings of prisoner being electrocuted.In U.S.A. In XXI century.Taken out of context - what does it say about Americans?Is that a true picture?"
1,Great work of Fiction,"Good ol Jan, he never ceases to entertain! Next to the autobiographies of Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy, I consider this one of the greatest works of fiction ever. Each hilarious fictitious account Jan concocted in his very prolific imagination elicited a guffaw of laughter from me.For Jan to weave such a detailed web of tales, peripheral to actual history, is astounding!Thank you Jan for using your brilliant mind to conjure up a journey into fantasy land, removed from reality and facts, to help pass by an otherwise uneventful day for me. :-)"
1,He needs to write a book about Soviet Jews,"Jews have a lot to own up to on their own. So many collaborated with Soviets and sent Polish Christian patriots to Gulags and yes Katyn. It is just so one sided that authors like this, of course only promote their victimization (which in this case is much flawed). Whereas they have hijacked the holocaust now they intend to blacken those who for the most part saved so many of them. Often at the expense of their own lives. Even so, there were instances that once the Jew who was hidden was found, he would turn over the Poles trying to save them to save their own skin!!! Anyway, this is a subject that could go on and on, but those who write the truth about this won't be published because they don't own the publishing companies nor do the consider themselves victims, but survivors. Here are some destruction of Polish communities by Jews - KONIUCHY AND NALIBOKI."
1,Relies Primarily on One Source: Consider the Source!,"It is never wise to construct an account largely on one source, but that is what Jan T. Gross has done in his account of Poles killing the Jews of Jedwabne. And what a source! It is Shmul Wasersztajn (Wasserstein). Wasersztajn was a Pole-hating Communist, and member of the Communist security forces (UB, or Bezpieka), which were responsible for murdering at least tens of thousands of Poles. It is hardly surprising that Wasersztajn would try to wash the blood off his hands by portraying the Poles as the murderers. Furthermore, Wassersztajn was not even an eyewitness.What about other sources, which Gross ignores? Did you know that there are Jewish (never mind the Polish) sources that affirm the fact that Germans, not Poles, were the main killers of Jedwabne's Jews? See the Peczkis reviews ofDeliverance: The Diary of Michael Maik, a True StoryandThe Warriors: My Life As A Jewish Soviet Partisan (Religion, Theology, and the Holocaust)."
3,not deep enough,This book was a tad disappointing. It didn't go in depth as many other books about the Holocaust do. There were very few personal stories or interviews to keep someone's attention.
2,Important beggining to discution,"I live in Poland and that book was a shock for many of my friends and generally Poles. It showes something very important- that destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne. Jan Tomasz Gross writes that the Poles are responsible for that masacre. As the later relations and facts said: it's propably not true. An author looks at Jedwabne only at his side, he didn't write about a lot of facts that do not correspond with his vision. So- that book is not good historician book.... So- for sure it's a book that you should read. On the other side- definetelly it's not the book you should belive in 100%. We have to wait to the end of investigation about Jedwabne. It is conducted by Institute of National Remembrance Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes Against the Polish Nation..."
3,Good topic but short and not well researched.,"This book has recieved much criticism and rightly so for its poor research. Gross never visited Jedwabne or conducted the interviews. In addition, their are very few sources but Gross trys to explain this away with his own personal view of historiography. Furthermore, the book is only 173 pages plus notes. Much of that is not even dedicated to Jedwabne but to other pogroms and what Gross calls ""atavistic antisemitism"" in Poland. However, it does bring to light for the first time that not only Nazis but also Poles participated in the killing of Jews and is noteworthy for this reason."
1,Evidence Counters Gross,"The findings at the site destroy this book; it is interesting as an artifact much like Wilkomirski's ""memoirs"". Those who praised it without waiting for the evidence don't mind being bigoted against Poles though the shoe would pinch on the other foot. Hypocrisy for the 21st century."
2,"moderately interesting topic, rather strange writing style","While the shamanist theme and inventive story are engaging, the writer seems determined to disrupt the reader by providing italicized emphasis for the characters' dialog. More often making the reader pause and wonder why it's there, rather than elucidating the charater's speach.The flow is disrupted by frequently confused sentence structure requiring reparsing to figure out what's intended."
2,Pools of Desire,"The movie have no story, just naked gorgeous guys who's just having fun, flirting, wrestling and teasing you through out the entire movie. This movie doesn't even have a love scene or intimate intercourse. It's better off renting it rather than buying it."
1,laughable,this is just very bad soft core porn with the worst narration imaginable. Do not waste your time or money.
5,"Great Entertainer, Superb Musician",Took me 8 long years to get a copy of this book. But the wait was well worth it. The lessons to be learnt from the struggle of one man with a dream indeed applies to every one of us. Truly inspirational - Barry Manilow is indeed an all rounded entertainer. His words take you with him on his journey and you feel for him when he is down and cheer aloud on his successes. Anyone out there have any idea where I would find copies of his other books??
5,Dribble....,"I don't actually own this book but ohmigods I want to! I have read it about, oh, five times, and it keeps getting better! I don't believe there is a better guide for the solitary Witch on the market! 'A Witch Alone' is best suited to the beginner -> somewhat experienced solitary Wiccan interested in ritual work. A practical but still beautiful workbook, it tops my recommended list, as even though it was written by a British Witch, it does make comments on southern hemisphere practices, something most 101 books do not! Gotta love that!Blessings."
3,well...,"While this book does raise some valid points about the throw away nature of today's Pagan movements, I'm not sure it isn't part and parcel of the self-same movements. I didn't find her condescending, but i did sort of get the feeling that she considered solitary practice a lesser one-good enough for the readers, but not for the author."
5,in response to reader in cali desert,the desert is sacred. i lived exactly where you do. the desert if filled with beauty and sacredness... you need to open your eyes and your heart and embrace what is around you.
3,I just don't see the appeal.,"This book is a cookie cutter work. Good, true, but nothing I haven't read before by better authors.I suppose if someone tied me up and said you can only have one book, this one would work as well as many others...If you can, preview this book first.There is nothing in it you can't learn elsewhere, and if you find you don't care for her style, it's just gonna bug you."
1,It's not Wicca Ms Green is peddling. . .,"Marian Greene's book takes what I consider to be an irresponsible stance on magick and the religion of Wicca. She doesn't seem to care at all about any sort of traditional teachings. If you're an eclectic, there are MANY books you should read before this one -- Spiral Dance, for instance. The only reason you'd want to read this book is for the exercises on entering Otherworld (which, by Ms Green's definition, seems far closer to shamanism)."
4,"Not For ""Fluff Bunnies""","For the Witch following a Solitary path, this is a great book. It is also not an easy book.It's very readable, and the material is presented in a way that is not hard to follow, but the lessons are sometimes challenging. As the title suggests, the book will take you a year (13 moon cycles) to complete and ""master natural magic.""Recommended for the serious student."
3,there are better books,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. This really is a type of witchcraft not many can follow. I've been reading many different books about the Craft and I found this the least helpful. She recommends all rituals be done outside and that a staff be used instead of an altar. For many, especially in urban areas, this is difficult. Her way of practicing is a very beautiful one but it is not for everyone. There are some good points to draw from it though, beginners often get wrapped up in the technical and proceedural aspects of the Craft and not in it's connection with nature and the Earth. It presents a wonderful Nature-centered practice for those willing to try it."
4,A great book on Traditional Witchcraft,"This book is great for the Solitary Traditional Witch. It is not necessarily for Wiccans, but they could still enjoy it with and open mind. Devote yourself to 13 moons of study with this book, and you will be very happy you did."
5,Really works!!!!!,"For sore,pulled or tired muscles try some....It really takes the pain away for a short while.I have achiles tendent pain in my foot and it gives me instant relief."
4,It works pretty good.,"Next time I will look for a creme, this drys fast and doesn't give me enough time to massage it in for a while. It works very good."
1,Don't waste your time!,I bought this at our local Lowes store for $315. I guess that Lowe's had a lot of trouble with this kind of shed. It comes with about 520 screws and bolts. To use this screws and bolts you will have to drill at least 250 holes as half of the existing holes are at the wrong place. After we started to assemble this shed we found out that the separate floor kit ($70) does not make any sense. We asked our local Lowe's store if they would know some contractor. They declined and told us that they had their demo unit built by a contractor. This contractor was not willing to assemble this building as he had already to much trouble with the demo units at Lowes. To many parts don't fit.
3,Regular Dust Brush,This inexpensive plastic brush does an okay job when the bristles don't shed. Not quite what I expected but then again you often get what you pay for.
3,Good Not Great!,This inexpensive plastic brush does an okay job when the bristles don't shed. Not quite what I expected but then again you often get what you pay for. Kudos to the seller for prompt delivery!
5,Fulton T9000101 T Series 900 lb Marine Winch Hand,Exactly as ordered! No issues or problems with seller or product :)Item works just fine! Actually even better than expected :)Would do business with again.
4,cake pan,i am very happy with the way the cake cooked and came out of the pan. however it had to be modified a little to go with the monster high theme.
1,not satisfied,I received these items and they were defective and as today the issued is still not resolved. This makes me hesitant to purchase anything else from your site.CK Products US Flag Pantastic Plastic Cake Pan
2,Not well built,"The light part works very well, however the shell and the stand is made of very cheap material. It is very tricky to get the protection cage on the light, and a small piece of plastic that is on the rim of the light cover broke off. I really needed the light and it was a minor part to the light the helps hold it on so it was still usable. The light that it puts off is very bright and from that aspect it is very usefull. I just don't see it lasting for very long."
4,Bright Light,I gave this as a present to my friend that likes to work on his cars. He has used it multiple times and it is very bright. He really likes the light and would recommend it to anyone that needs extra light for their work areas.
2,broken,"I also received this light broken. The external mailing box was intact, but the box inside had obviously been dropped prior to packing. It was frustrating because whoever boxed it up, had to have seen the damaged box and could hear pieces rattling around inside. We opted for a refund, but Amazon was great and timely to get our refund back to us."
3,Was a little less than expected,"The light burned out the original bulb after only 20 minutes use. The light has not been dropped or abused at all. It does come as described, but I have found so many for far less money locally that I would recommend checking with the local suppliers first and then compare. I ordered a cooper double light with a stand at the same time and the improved quality of the cooper is very noticable. The 500 watt lights do make nightime work very safe and large jobs are very possible due to the light's 50 to 60 foot working range, maybe more."
4,Light,"I bought this light to mount on a stand for better light when working on cars. It works good, but the extra bulb was mising."
5,One of the better,I own a lot of anime and have seen even more. Ruin Explorers impressed me with its well drawn art and a story with a few twists to keep you guessing. After I watched the first tape I was glad I had gotten the second tape at the same time. If I hadn't I would have bit me nails until well... you get the picture. My point is this anime is good and that don't buy just one. One is not enough! You will NEED the second tape after watching the first. As a minor note if you have the dubbed version of a Slayers movie the dubbed version of Ruin Explorers is fun to watch since they use some of the same voices. This is one anime not to be passed up.
3,"Fun, yeah, but ultimately nothing special","Here we have your standard fantasy treasure hunt, complete with cat-girl and spunky herioine. The animation is pretty good, the visuals bright, and the slapstick blah. The main problem with it is that there is nothing in it I hadn't seen before. The characters are borrowed from series such as The Slayers, the magic is no more impressive than, say, Lodoss War, and the plot is right out of a hack fantasy novel. If it took all of the standard elements and tried to do something new and interesting with them, I'd rate it higher, but overall, this is an example of a decently done anime title that seems eerily familiar."
4,"Fun, cute adventuring.","Ruin Explorers is a 2 volume anime series... it's from the ""game of AD&D on tape"" class of anime, meaning people trekking around through dungeons in search of treasure but ending up saving the world instead. It's a lot of fun to watch, kind of like Slayers! but neither as overpowered nor quite as wacky. The catgirl sidekick is just cute (in the adorable sense)."
3,"Great art, good conclusion, but a typical fantasy story.","Again, this is a great piece of anime art and design, but the average plot line is almost uninteresting. The battles with the possessed puppet creatures are really cool and the group works well together to hone their skills. The final showdown has all the cheese of a bad final boss clash with ghosts of past lovers and time standing still, swords cutting the bad guy in half, dragon spirits, etc. Regretably the characters don't have a satisfactory wrap up in the end leaving the view a little anxious for a tentative series...which never comes. Get it if you love good artwork! The voices are well done."
2,"I've seen worse in anime, but....","Is there anything good to say about this anime? Well... I can't think of anything right now. All the characters were very flat and two-dimensional. The story was choppy, the dialogue was dull, and the animation was mediocre at best. I think this anime was supposed to be humorous, but it even fails at that. I am a fan of this genre of anime, but I would strongly recommend against anyone adding this particular title to his or her collection."
2,"Canundrum Films, indeed","4 short films of about 20 minutes each. No unifying theme, just 4 surrealist exercises in film making with low production values. An hour and 20 minutes I will never get back.Do not get hooked as I was by the title, it describes only the first short. I thought a mash-up of Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and Kafka's Metamorphosis would be unusual enough to be interesting. Wrong. The 2nd short was also tied in to Christmas, but that's the only similarity - Waiting for Godot while driving. 3rd short is absurdist anti-materialist dialogue (sort of dozed off for part of it), and the last one is actually a kind of sweet love story.Bottom line - don't waste your time."
3,a note on absurdity,"Kafka is well known for the achievement of absurdity in his work. It must be remembered, however, that Kafka's absurdity was not absurdity for its own sake, and though often comical, was nightmarish and profound. The absurdity seen here, though clever and very funny, isn't what Kafka was about. That doesn't at all discredit this short film, but it is important to make a distinction."
5,in defense,"I have to speak in defense of ""Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life."" Yes, the idea of mixing Kafka and Capre is entirely absurd, but isn't that what makes it so incredibly Kafka? Kafka always used absurdity to depict the modern world, and I think he would have appreciated the short immensely for that (though the end was a bit shakey, but I guess that's what we have to give to Capre.) I loved this short, as well as the others on the DVD."
5,Comedy Knockouts,This is a great dvd that is full of great comedians in their younger years. It makes for a good laugh. It is always good to laugh. :) Thanks!
4,Cobra Venom Is The Weapon,The killer uses venom from a cobra to eliminate his victims in this film. Sidney Toler plays Chan and the cast includes Benson Fong as Tommie Chan and Manton Moreland in the role of Birmingham Brown. Fong and Moreland are really quite good as a comic team. George Callahan and George Wallace Sayre handle the screen play. THE SHANGHAI COBRA is one of the better entries in the Chan series.
3,This is one of the better Monogram Chans.,"This mystery concerns the murder of several victims by cobra bites. It has Mantan Moreland and Benson Fong again getting into trouble as usual. The criminals' objective is to rob a bank vault of a valuable government depository of radium. The viewer must follow the plot closely since the denouement when Chan finally corners the leader occurs rapidly. This film uses the new invention of television well as part of the criminals' devices. The running gag in this film concerns Birmingham getting an illegal U-turn ticket and saying ""But you said 'No, you turn here! So I turned!'"" At the end of the film, Chan himself gets an illegal U-turn ticket and uses the same excuse to the inspector. ""But you say 'No, you turn here!' and everybody ends up laughing. Classic Chan line is ""Cannot sell bear skin before shooting bear""."
3,It's OK,I have the most of the Charlie Chan movies in my collection. This was a bit weak in content. Not the usual good stuff I have come to expect!
3,Thematic Units,This guide for developing thematic units can be very useful for someone who has never created a unit before. The book gives step by step instrutions on how to develop a unit and what should be included. The guide also gives very helpful examples of sample units.
4,Developing Interdisciplinary Thematic Units,"A guide for Developing Interdisciplinary Thematic Units by P. Roberts and R. Kellough is a very helpful tool for writing Thematic units. The book is full of helpful hints for educators to make their units stellar, thumbs up!"
2,Review,"This is a great book to use as a guide for developing a thematic unit. However, I also found the internet to be great guide."
3,Developing your own thematic unit?,"Although it acts as a workbook (which i did not utilize), there is a lot ofinformation that helps the reader to organize their own thematic unit. Chapter 2provided me with the most insight towards completing my thematic unit. The samplelesson plans were great guides in putting together a detailed lesson of my own"
4,Resourceful,"The manual, A Guide for Developing Interdisciplinary Thematic Units 2nd Ed., gives good instruction and guidance in developing thematic units. The text is easy to follow and the examples make it easy to understand."
4,Health Education Teacher - NW Chicago,"This book was an excellent resource when preparing and finalizing my thematic unit. It was clearly written and gave step by step information on how to successfully design and implement a thematic unit. The book gives numerous examples of effective objectives, activities, lessons and assessments that were good resources. I found this book to be an easy read and a good reference."
5,ROberts & Kellough,Roberts & Kellough: A Guide for Developing Interdisciplinary Thematic Units is a great book for beginning teachers. I found it to be a helpful resource and guide for developing an interdisciplinary thematic unit. It provides a practical approach to take when designing a unit. A wide variety of content is included within the five chapters. Every aspect that an educator needs to consider when designing a thematic unit it touched on. I especially found the planning master sheets to be very helpful. It was a great way to organize my thoughts and finalize my unit. Overall I found this book to be a helpful resource for this class. I will continue to use this book in the future when planning thematic units.
5,Excellent Teaching Tool,"A Guide for Developing Interdisciplinary Thematic Units is very user friendly and practical. It was nice to be assigned a text that I actually enjoyed using. I think it would be a fabulous resource in an undergraduate methods course. The setup is simple to follow, it provides good guidelines and checklists to evaluate your own work, and it provides good additional resources to access."
4,Thematic Units,A Guide for Developing Interdisciplinary Thematic Units This book has been developed for the sole purpose of guiding teachers in developing thematic units of instruction using an interdisciplinary method. It explains the advantages of developing integrated curriculums. This practical guide helps teachers in creating units that are geared to problem solving skills with an inquiry based approach to teaching.

4,A Guide for Developing Interdisciplinary Thematic Units,A Guide for Developing Interdisciplinary Thematic Unitsis a very user-friendly book for those interested in creating interdisciplinary units. It simplifies the workof creating an ITU through it's use of informationfollowed by plenty of examples. The information andoptions for various forms of assessment were veryvaluable because assessment tends to be a gray area forteachers.
4,A Useful Resource,This will be my resource for future interdisciplinary thematic units. The easy-to-follow format made creating my first unit a pleasure. The activities in each section helped me ensure I was following the process correctly. I recommend this book to anyone interested in ITUs.
4,KELLOUGH REVIEW,"The text by Kellough encourages educators to incorporate multilevel instruction, emphasis is on the teacher, role of the student, and technology in developing interdisciplinary units. Chapter 5 gives sample lesson plans and guidelines that take you step-by-step through writing a unit."
5,Review of Thematic Units by Roberts & Kellough,"A Guide for Developing Interdisciplinary Thematic Unit (2nd Edition) - Roberts & Kellough This text I like very much. It caters to my type of learning by offering pictures and illustrations. It is more of a workbook type text, which is very helpful to me. It provides step-by-step instruction on how to develop thematic units with ""fill in the blank"" forms and everything. At the end of every chapter it offers discussion question and a summary of the chapter as well as various activity exercises. I also enjoyed reading the quotes by Albert Einstein at the beginning of every chapter. This text is easy reading and easy to follow which is great for me."
4,Evaluation,"Wow, this is the absolute guider to educator. I will hold on to this book for ever and ever as long as I am an educator. I recommend this book for educators."
3,Review of Roberts and Kellough,"Roberts and Kellough provided an excellent recipe for developing a good thematic unit. If a teacher must provide documented connections with state curriculum standards, the templates included in this guide help make the connection much easier. The template for lesson plans is one that all teachers should follow regardless of whether or not they are developing a thematic unit."
4,The thematic unit book,"Any teacher or administrator that is into thematic units and understands the importance of such units, must read this book! The book gives great insight on how to develop a proper, complete, and thorough thematic unit. This is one of those books that is not difficult to read, and can be covered thoroughly in about 3 days. The book concludes with a 25 point checklist to evaluate your thematic unit."
3,Thematic Units by Roberts & Kellough,"Thematic Units by Robert & KelloughI find this book to be useful for planning and developing possible interdisciplinary thematic unit for the near future. As a math instructor of seven years, this book has increased my awareness of various web sites that can be used in planning my math activities and math projects. As a visual learner, I appreciate the examples that were used to develop an interdisciplinary thematic unit."
4,thematic review,"This was a pretty good book for me to use with my thematic unit assignment. It was a little cluttered with information but I found it useful in the end. The information was in the book but it was not as easy to locate as in other books. Overall, this book did what it was supposed to do for me....that is all I can ask."
5,Excellent Resource,This book is a great source of information regarding the planning of ITU's. It goes in to great detail about the various aspects of ITU's. The chapter on Developing Objectives and Learning Activities is a perfect fingertip reference as it contains a great chart of action verbs for Bloom's Categories.
4,A Guide for Developing Interdisciplinary Thamatic Units,This text was essential in developing a thematic unit. The material is presented in ways to enhance teaching strategies and improve studnet learning. It was very useful in helping me as a secondary school teacher.
4,Thematic Unit review,The book allows the student to receive guidance in creating thematic units. Though some items are not crystal clear it does get the job done. This book could be better by getting to the point a bit quicker and leaving showing more real examples of units. In all fairness it does give a thorough discription for thematic units which helps in allowing to better understand the philosopy behind them.
5,Review - Guide for Thematic Units by Roberts and Kellough,"As I think back to my undergraduate days, I honestly cannot recall using a textbook or informational book about how to write an interdisciplinary thematic unit (which caused much stress.) Therefore, the thematic unit guide by Roberts and Kellough and experience from previous work made writing a thematic unit easier and less time consuming. This guide has wonderful information that easy to comprehend. The aspect most appealing to me about the text was that it provided ""worksheet"" areas that had the different components of the unit broken down into sections, i.e. scope and sequence, objectives, rubric ideas, and much more.I would strongly recommend students in their undergraduate and postgraduate studies to purchase this book. I know that I will be able to use it in the future."
4,"Educators..Need help with thematic units, check this out!","If you ever needed to create an interdisciplinary thematic unit, or just want to create one, this is the book for you! Step-by-step instructions will guide you through the process. Roberts & Kellough make it simple, and easy to understand. Need help planning, assessing, or creating top of the line lesson plans, buy this book. You'll be happy you did."
5,Review of textbook Developing Interdisciplinary Thematic Uni,This textbook was very helpful to me when I was developing my thematic unit. This text contains step-by-step information that I was able to use when developing my unit. I would recommend this book to anyone who has to develop a thematic unit.
4,NOVA student - Eric,"The text ""A Guide for Developing Interdisciplinary Thematic Units"" by Patricia Roberts and Richard Kellough is very well written and easy to follow. It provides a detailed outline of the items which need to be included in a thematic unit. I believe this book would be more helpful to teachers in an elementary setting rather than a high school atmospere. Overall, I found this book to be very useful in my Master's program."
4,Evaluation of Textbooks,"This textbook, A Guide for Developing Interdisciplinary Thematic Units is very useful. The content is thorough. There is a glossary and index. This writer utilized all of the sections in this book and especially the examples of the thematic units."
2,Thematic Unit,"Discussion 6I found the curriculum impovement book to be a very interesting and excellent book to read. It is a very well written book. The only thing I would wish for would be to use a more current text. So much information changes in the world of education. A book that is even two years old is out dated in this day and age. The other book on thematic teaching is alright and most likely great for K-12 teachers, but does not seem to be very useful to me at the college level."
1,thematic Unit,"Discussion 6I found the curriculum Improvement book to be a very interesting and excellent book to read. It is a very well written book. The only thing I would wish for would be to use a more current text. So much information changes in the world of education. A book that is even two years old is out dated in this day and age. The other book on thematic teaching is alright and most likely great for K-12 teachers, but does not seem to be very useful to me at the college level."
4,Teacher's Resource,"This book provides detailed examples of lesson plans to support Interdisciplinary Thematic Units. It is an excellent resource for teachers because it explains the rationale behind ITU's, describes how they coincide with national standards, demonstrates how to create them, and defines ways of assessing their effectiveness. There are also numerous reproducible forms that the authors encourage readers to use when creating ITU's."
3,Interdisciplinary Units,"Thematic Units by Robert and Kellough is, in my opinion, to aid teachers in developing effective thematic units. I don't feel that this book has much to offer an administrator unless the administrator is looking for a feasible way in which to refresh his or her staff on the issue of thematic units."
3,Helpful,"Although I do agree that this book is not helpful for people with no previous web site skills, it did help me convert from hard-coding into the more in-depth extensions and abilities of frontpage. 7 years of using notepad and 3 years of Coldfusion is hard to break and, although I had used Frontpage on many occasions before, this book was the key for me to master the recquirement of knowing Frontpage for my job. Of course I knew the easy stuff like tables, but the last 1/3 of the book containing things you can't do using frontpage unless you do it their way is useful."
1,Incomplete,"I have experience in Power Point and many other Microsoft programs already that I thought would help me get through learning FrontPage and it did, some. But, I can't beleive that this book was ever tested on someone who had no experience with web-site design before it was published. I could not follow it. I do not rate this book as being much help to a beginner."
4,A must for any cigar enthusiast!,"If your looking for a good novel, you need to look elsewhere. If you are interested in learning more than you ever wanted to know about cigars, then you've found your book. Cigar Aficianado is one of the leading authorities on the world of cigar's and cigar smoking. The Buying Guide is so much more than that. It includes tips on cutting, lighting, and smoking, liquers that go well with cigars, ratings of cigars, as well as names and addresses of fine tobacco stores and cigar friendly restaurants from around the U.S. This book was a gift to me from a friend and it makes a wonderful gift. If you are an avid cigar enthusiast or just an occasional partaker of the finer pleasure of cigars, you will want to add this book to your collection."
4,Still enjoyable,"While I would like to have bought the complete series rather than just a dvd featuring four random episodes, I can't complain about it otherwise. The sound and picture are fine and it pretty much succeeds in bringing back childhood memories of watching this."
5,Best ear cleaner for dogs with severely dry skin!,"My dog has sebacceous adenitis, which is an autoimmune disorder that attacks the oil glands in the skin. Needless to say he has very dry skin all over - including the skin in and around his ears. This cleaner was recommended by my dog's dermatologist and it is wonderful. It is a bit oily (which is what my dog needs) and cleans out his ears without drying them out further! This is the only ear cleaner I will use for my dog from now on."
4,the funk soul brotha check it out,"I have this book.. havn't read it all through but just small amounts (I just barely got it). It's pretty good from what I've read and such, is packed w/ info and seems to be accurate info instead of just some crap to entertain people. It's correct about Ouija boards on how you shouldn't mess w/ them at all depending on how you're going to use it, should only be used by a ""good"" person and not a n00ber because it can attract evil or mischievous spirits depending. It's written by two lady's and revised by another, also I read in the front that there were others involved in the process. The two main authors hold years of experiance so it's good. I would give it 5 stars but I havn't read it all through so it get's 4 for now.aloha and mahalo,berdwin(I'm not LDS)"
3,"I love the electric eels, but...",It gets to be too much after a while. This band has been explored with similar collections before and they are all pretty much the same. This record does win the award for the worst cover art in my collection though.
4,proto punk at it's crudest!,"These recordings are not easy to explain. Try this: take even cruder versions of Iggy's ""Funhouse"", MC5's ""High Time"", the Dolls' ""Too Much Too Soon"", Dictator's ""Go Girl Crazy"", anything by Captain Beefheart and the Sonics... then mash them all together into a discusting bloody pulp! If these recordings had received a ""proper"" mix and release in their time the Eels would not only have beaten the Ramones to the punch but 1975 (not 76) would have then gone down in history as punk's ""official"" first year!"
4,this is totally gnar rippage!,"I bought this cd because i heard the song ""Agitated"" on a cbgb's album. I thought it was great. The first time I listened to this cd, i think i got a headache. Actually, I think I did the second and third times as well. After that, I discovered the poetry of chaos and despair. I could tell how bored and mad about being bored they were when writing songs. They're fast, loud, and annoying. If that doesn't make you want to buy it, maybe they're laugh out loud lyrics will- trying to think up words that rhymed with the last ones (it didn't matter what they were), and just singing whatever came to mind- you'll see what I mean. This single compound disc went from giving me headaches, to making the Electric Eels one of my favorite bands ever."
4,A Good Reference,A good basic reference book but not for advanced research. The information is hit or miss. There are some complete emperor biographies and some with barely two sentences describing an emperor's reign.
4,"Good, but brief introduction to Chinese history","I purchased this book in Shanghai hoping to learn more about early Chinese history. I had just visited Huang Shan meaning Yellow Mountain named after Huang Di, the Yellow Emperor. In this book there are only a few sentences on him. The material the book does cover is presented in an interesting but brief manner. Covering the material in great detail would take require a volume much larger. I recommend this as an introduction and starting point for those not familiar with Chinese history."
4,I liked it a lot.,"The title of the book says it all. It was very informative and concise. Great overview of 2,200 years of Chinese Imperial History."
2,Inaccurate information,"The author states that the first Tang Emperor, Li Yuan, designated his second son, Li Shimin, a crown prince. In fact, the crown prince was not Li Shimin but his first son, killed by Li Shimin in the 926 coup."
1,Unsatisfied,"I received the unit on 2/11/06, and returned it to the mfg'r on 3/11/06, which means it lasted less than a month. The CD player quit working. Also, the fog free mirror never stayed fog free."
4,very good book for adults grieving loss of mother or father,"This book is very well written and easy to read. It describes a typical grief support group that the author leads, and through the group members' stories, shows us various ways we may be feeling or grieving our parent's death. Some are grieving the loss of a mother or father who just died, and some are still dealing with feelings from such a loss from years before. I think that this book would be especially helpful for those of us who have ""unfinished business"" with the mother or father who has died - things left unsaid, guilt over behavior that might have been hurtful, problems with surviving siblings or parent, and so on. The author offers us a unique perspective on how to get past that kind of hindrance and come to peace with the loss"
2,Limited amount of information,I found this product to have limiting amount of information. You can get all of material found in this product and 3 times more from Memory Notebook of Nursing CD: A CD of Memory Notebook Images
3,Not quite enough,"This is really a wealth of information and shows great ways to help you to remember. However, in some categories there are way too few drugs mentioned. If a person just hadn't been spoiled in other categories where the top drugs that are used are given to us for memory, it wouldn't have been so bad. Other than that, it is just GREAT:-)"
4,"""Must Have More"" L7.","I gotta say, I thought the 3 albums before this were so great, they couldn't do it again. I was wrong. This disc is just as good as the ones before it, and probably most like ""Hungry For Stink"". Almost every track is sweet, and typical ""L7"", so I won't list them off. The rocking and subject matter are what you would expect from them. What I'm most amazed at, is how much these chicks rock, yet they never got more popular than they did in the ""Bricks Are Heavy"" era. But I guess they said it best, the ""Masses Are Asses"". Maybe they'll release a collection soon."
5,gotta get it!!!,"This is one of L7's best yet. I know you will fall in love with their music once your ears have discovered what they have to offer!! It's a combo of trash/metal/pop all in to one CD. You have to listen to ""I Need"" and ""Bitter Wine"". They don't sound like the band Hole, but most fans of Hole love L7!!!! send me your comments or critisizm"
3,A little gem,"This is hardly great cinema, but it is an interesting exercise in making what is essentially a silent film in a time when silent films were a quickly receding memory. Most of those involved in making this film, however, undoubtedly were children or young adults at the time sound and dialog were introduced into film, so this is a sort of nostalgic use of sound by people who still remembered film silence."
3,Interesting experiment/failed cold war film,"The Thief contains no spoken dialogue. It was an interesting experiment that really is a dead end. One cannot imagine or desire a whole series of films like this but, as a stand alone, the film is good. It fails as a ""cold war"" film since the viewer cannot really tell who the ""thief"" actually is working for. Could be Moscow but could easily be Egypt. That said. The Thief is very watchable. The direction is excellent. The performances are all first rate, especially Ray Milland. The film really hinges on Milland's silent acting skills and he truly carries the film. This is a must have for any Milland fan. One is hard pressed to think of a film that so completely belongs to a single actor yet here it is. Milland is commended for taking a chance on such an unorthodox film. He succeeds. The film succeeds."
1,Awful.,"This book is awful, boring and poorly written. I would not have read so much of it, if I hadn't been so tired. How on earth did this drivel get printed?"
5,Great Product,"Easy to use and nice flavor - I get the HOT and its not too hot, just rightGreat service as well"
4,Washington Trivia,"This is a fun and interesting book! I purchased it for my son after he recently moved to Washington State from our home state of NY. I thought it would make for an interesting way to learn about his new home state. Really offers many informative facts that I didn't see in any of the other books I purchased about the state at the same time.Explains many of the words, terms and folklore of the state which makes for a fun read!"
4,Great floor cleaner,"Love this for my sealed hardwood floors. Use to refill the original spray bottle, add water and you have a great cleaner. Leaves floors clean, no streaks, no buildup. I use once a week and my floors look great!"
3,"Good, but water gets into light","I bought these lights thinking that when i put my plow truck in reverese that i will have more light. I do have good lighting now but when it rains or i drive through a puddle, one of the lights gets water through the seal and takes a few days to drain out. Other than that the lights are pretty bright."
4,Arrival on time,"Arrival on time, this work lamp are in his box rigth now because i have not time in this moment to install itllegaron a tiempo, no lo he instaldo aun por falta de tiempo..."
3,Small book with a lot of recipes,"When I read it was 80 pages, I expected it to be a regular sized book. It's only about the size of a postcard! (4.5"" X 5.5"") No photos at all. If you want a Tex Mex cookbook, this one is great, but I just ordered a different one to go along with it for a ""complete"" recipe collection."
3,Just OK,Not great recipes and a pretty small book for the price. Should have ordered either this or the dessert book but not both as once and would have known better just how small.......not a good buy for the money.
1,No pictures,This book has no pictures. I did not find it very helpful. It's also too small for me to use in the kitchen.
5,outstanding,"This record is masterpiece... tough words to live up to, but it does. Great American music from a one-of-a-kind artist, who people will someday be talking about in the same breath as Hank Williams and Bob Dylan. Buy it."
1,Don't waste your time or money...,"Perhaps the critics that compare Earle to Bono, Dylan and Johnny Cash are the ones that are really on drugs. There is a reason why Mr. Earle has had one ""hit""...songwriting and singing. Other than that he's GREAT!His lament concerning politics and his ""demons"" grows old fast. His raspy ""country"" voice sounds contrived at best, sorta like a Karaoke singer after a few too many has relieved him of his inhibitions.I was drawn to the album because of the ballad ""Ben McCulloch"". I was told it was GREAT. What a let-down. After suffering through 9 tracks my eager anticipation quickly turned to yearning....yearning to hear the sound of nails on a chalkboard rather than continue with the torture of Mr. Earle's infernal ""talent"".My copy of ""Train a Comin'"" brought me .99 cents on a popular auction site. Thanks Steve. Net loss...$12 bucks.Keep pumpin' out those Dylan-esqe editorials on America plus your gut-wrenching ballads and your legacy will be assured.Seeesh."
2,disappointed,"Maybe it is a matter of expectations. I listened to this album expecting to hear some interesting guitar playing, songs with something to say, and so on from this ""country renegade."" Sadly, I had to get to track 10, Ben McCullough, before finding a song with anything interesting and compelling to say.There are some great musicians on this album, but the playing strikes me as straight-ahead Bluegrass/Country with few surprises.And, another thing: is his accent for real? It sounds kind of forced to me."
5,Not one of the best ... the best ... in my judgment,"""Train-a-comin"" was the album that got me back into Steve Earle after buying his Hillbilly Highway back in the 80s. Until ""Train"", I had lost interest in Earle, thinking he was a flash in the pan. Now that I'm back into his music, I realize nothing could be further from the truth. ""Train"" is one of those rare wall-to-wall solid recordings that never disappoints and usually inspires sing-along in the car. I think it's a perfect record. After ""Train,"" I've picked up on Earle's other 90s offereings, and I have found them to be excellent as well. His latest, ""El Corazon"" is particularly good. But the one that made it all work for me is ""Train"". For an all-acoustic album, it's wonderfully diverse, with nice acoustic blendings, harmonies, and soulful thumpings. For me, this album is an access point into one of the most amazing singer/songwriting talents of our time."
5,A Treasure of Unexpected Delights!,"Every party I have, I play this CD. I love turning friends on to Steve's musical works. He such a versatile singer/songwriter. Nothin' Without You is perhaps the best country song ever written, if only for its complete simplicity and Steve's wonderful delivery. Emmy's background vocals lends an etheral memorable quality to it that reverbrates in the mind long after the song is over.Steve can do covers better than the originals. Rivers of Babylon and Tecumseh Valley are two fine examples. Imagine reggae Steve Earle style. Sometimes She Forgets reminds us that no one can do Steve's songs better than himself, even Travis Tritt who made a hit of this song several years ago.Buy it and introduce it to all your friends. Maybe we can get a pyramid scheme going to get everyone in the US to listen to this great, great work of art!"
5,A Classic,"Steve Earle has become one of my favorite, and I think one of the best ALLTIME songwriters ever. This collection is so well done,one of his best, with outstanding musicianship!You simply cannot appreciate GOOD folk & bluegrass and not love this CD."
4,Okay,"The toys weren't exactly what I expected. I don't know if I just missed somethin somewhere when I looked at the item before I purchased, but you have to be able to pull the crib bars out in order to put these toys on. The toys are great quality and everything, I just can't use them with the crib I've got."
2,Small items,The toys were small and it was difficult to get the straps loose so the could be hung around the bars.
2,Here kitty kitty,"These things shed worse than my cat, and even my vet thinks she's a prodigy. If you don't mind getting 'hairs' in your food, these work well. But they're going in the trash here."
2,They lose bristles more then any brush I have owned,"I had high hopes for these brushes, especially with the commercial tag. I truly couldn't imagine using any of these on a large scale. You would def be removing bristles from whatever you are making. Maybe, I was just sent old ones and the adhesive is failing. I have used them a few times and have yet to not pull bristles out, whether it be egg wash or just butter. I figure it will eventually stop. I am just hoping it's before it looses all it's bristles. If they didn't shed I would rate them higher. The brushes work well minus that fact. It just gets annoying after a while. I own a few pastry brushes, none shed like this. Wish they were more commercially made."
4,Worth the money!,"I needed pastry brushes for my baking projects and such. These are great sizes and definitely get the job done well. Once in a while a bristle or two will fall out, that's the reason for only 4 stars instead of 5."
4,A Book for Understanding,"As an American woman who has struggled in relationships with Indian men, this book offers some peace of mind and understanding. The author's vivid descriptions of parents' ideals and their children's confusion upon landing in the U.S. makes it easier to understand the reasons behind our immense cultural differences. The book outlines the fact that our two cultures define ""love"" very, very differently. This was an excellent read that I could not put down for a moment."
4,Definition of love in Indian Marriages,"A very well written and engrossing book. I would definitely recommend it to anybody of Indian origin, specifically Indian Americans. However, what this book completely fails in is in describing love in Indian Marriages...according to Ms. Divakaruni, an Indian woman may find security, and affection in a relationship...but never love...love (which I wish she would have defined for us - the ignorant readers) is the prerogative of American (western) relationships only. She is a good storyteller neverthless."
2,Sad Soap Operas,"Being a married Indian woman myself, I eagerly picked up Arranged Marriage: Stories, assuming that Divakaruni would have brought both the successful and the unsuccessful arranged marriage stories to light. After reading the first four stories, I decided to put the book down. Everyone of these stories was a real downer -- if the husband wasn't a jerk, then it was the poor wife who was left a widow, or the woman who was jerked around by the Foster Services agency. All four of the stories were depressing and read rather like tearjerking soap operas. I am not sure I would read another book by her again."
3,"good issues, but repetitive","The author did a good job writing about issues that seem to be very real for Indian women, but each story seemed to stem from the same root. There was always a young Indian woman who was usually the main character of the tale. She had usually come from Calcutta, and was living in the states, in the Bay Area in CA. She always had some sort of emotional tie to her Indian upbringing or family; this was what brought on the conflict. Then the conflict, a stray child, a live-in boyfriend, marriage, racial issues, etc........and though each of these were different, the women would always handle them the same: with small vigor in the beginning, but then they would become depressed and at the end of the story, the conflict would end with some sort of realization about how they should have handled the situation. The book had some good stories with good lessons for life, but after a while they became predictable and boring because of the author's repetitiveness."
3,"Overly didactic, but interesting","The problem with these stories is that Ms. Divakaruni seems more interested in ""issues"" than in character or plot. The heroines are virtually interchangeable; they are all either traditional women on the verge of breaking free, or spunky, rebellious immigrants trying to acclimate themselves to American life. The conflicts seem ripped from newspaper headlines: Sex-Selective Abortion! Wife-Abuse! However, when Ms. Divakaruni steps off her sociological soapbox long enough to pay attention to just telling a story, (As in ""The Maid-Servant's Story"") she shines."
2,Repetitive sob stories ;-(,"I found this book extremely negative. It's an array of sob stories, and a tad too repetitive. The constant sadness and misery would have been okay, had the stories been more insightful or if the writing style was more creative. It is evident that the author loves potato curry and mahogany beds, but she should have allowed her characters some variety !An individual story is OK, you could enjoy it as a newspaper or magazine article, but a book full of them is unbearable. The book brings back memories of Indian television soaps where there is never a shortage of unfortunate incidents but a complete lack of depth or perspective."
5,Arranged Marriage: Stories,"This is a great book, it really gives insight on this culture compared to American culture."
3,Predictable and stereotypical.,This book is very predictable and feeds into the negative stereotypes of arranged marriages and Indian women. Very disappointing. I believe the only reason this book gained acclaim was because it is the first book of its kind to deal with the topic of arranged marriages. It gives some insight into Indian cultures. Some situations are familiar. I am wondering if the author knows someone who went through all these situations.
4,A Glimpse of Indian American Life,Mrs. Banerjee has shown us a picture of Indiansociety as it is today. Most of the stories areabout Indian emigrants who live in the U.S. andtheir struggles here. The writing is colorfuland crisp; the stories are highly engaging.
5,"An excellent, almost haunting book","This is one of the most treasured books in my library. I love the scope of emotions covered and the way her writing allows me to empathize with her characters. Plus, she covers a wide variety of situations -- American-educated women, women straight from India, etc. There's a lot of tragedy here but also a strand of hope running throughout the book as a whole. Not every story, mind!"
1,"stereotypical, pity-the-indian-woman syndrome, repeatedly.",skip this book. save your time. unfortunately the rating did not have zero stars.
2,Gets old quick...,"I was quite dissapointed in this book. The themes, and indeed the entire manner of writing in this collection of stories is repetative and stale. The details change from story to story, but nothing else. Many of the author's other works (namely the ""unknow error of our lives"") seem to follow suit. It would have been nice to have encountered some variety, whether it be in character perspective, the unraveling of the plot, or simply in style. If you are considering this book, I would suggest that there are other books with similar themes, but much more well written"
5,Excellent story of our times/culture,"I think till now i have been seeing/hearing from my parents, family, friends about something age-old called culture; It sounded like a bunch of principles set for an age long past. To me in this book i think the author has tried to show how the present generation is struggling, managing with the difficulties these cultural practices put normal people into and how they are making the best out of it. I am really amazed by how close this book comes to touching the real life. Really awesome!"
2,So depressing,"Being an Indian and having married into an ""Arranged marriage"" myself, is why I picked up this book. I had read ""Sister of my heart"" which is what got me interested in Divakaruni's writing. While ""Sister"" is a good read, I was disappointed to see some of the same material repeated in ""Arranged"". The lives of Indian women in the large middle class are not so melodramatic or pathetic. In my view, the women in most Indian families are not so much at the recieving end of cruelty or so powerless as portrayed in these works. I wish Divakaruni will bring out the brighter aspects of Indian womanhood and Indian immigrants to balance out the gray picture she has painted in these works."
2,A Collection of Adolescent Monotony,"A disappointing, predictable and (again) unsophisticated and almost juvenille product from Ms. Divakaruni. Negative in its tone. Self-concious and self-important in style. As in her ""Mistress.."", Divakaruni constantly throws out these ""exotic"" Indian terms, etc., as if to ""wow"" the gullible, pedestrian masses (her ""readership""). She should start including a glossary in her books. And again, as in ""Mistress..."", all protagonists as it were, seem to be longing for a tall, ""romantic"", (caucasian) Euro-male. What I've always sensed from Ms. Divakaruni is an undercurrent of white-male-lust and longing - and an odd self-loathing. She had better stop being ""cute"" and embrace herself for what she is. There is also something stilted and dishonest in her work."
2,"19"" here means cubic incnes of foam, not diameter","When I ordered this I thought I was getting a big ball 19"" in diameter, When it got here I found a small ball only 6"" (the math adds up, that is near 19 cubic inches). It is a nice squeezable foam, much nicer than the nerf ball I was thinking of. I am going to keep it, for anyone else looking for a similar ball I suggest going down to sporting goods store and hold the ball before buying."
4,Looks great but does not bounce much,I'm sure this is a quality ball but I was expecting it to bounce like a nerf foam ball. It bounces very little. Certainly not enough to play 2 square on a indoor floor like I wanted it for. Amazon is great and allowed me to keep it so I'll see how it holds up.
3,Crapish Compared To Others...,"(hah! i am the first to review! muahaha!)yes. i know. i called an amelia atwater-rhodes book *gasp* CRAP! seriously though, compared to any other thing she had written it is.if you liked hawksong and REALLY want to know what happens after, read it. if not, wait for something else to come out and hope its better.ok reasons it was crap:the point of view (by Zane) could have been WAY better!the whole focus of it is the falcon problem thing, and it also could have been written better.sure, there are a few twists (and i mean ONLY a few), but all in all, i still say it was crap. and i am so sorry for all the people like me who were WAITING AGES to get it..and were so let down."
4,Pretty Good,"I loved the first book, however this book didn't meet its standards. But since I loved the first book it was kind of hard to live up to the first one. This book I felt had less adventure and less romance. And unlike the first book, the book is written only from Zane's point of view. I recommend the book though, if you liked the first one."
4,Unfortunately...,"Let me say, to begin with, that I have LOVED all of Atwater-Rhodes books, especially Hawksong. Her characters and situations are vividly and intesely real. However, Snakecharm did not meet the high expectations I held for it. It is still a very good book, and worth reading, but it is not up to her usual standard in my opinion. I would have liked more interaction between Zane and Danica, that being the aspect I feel brought such emotion to Hawksong. I think her books are normally much more character based, whereas she tried to fit so much plot into this one that there was no room left for anything else."
1,Disapointed,"Having read all of Atwaters books, I think that she has huge potential as a writer, though needs to refine her work before publishing it."
2,"For the love of YHWH, Amelia...","... please finish what you start. Amelia has the habit of touching on interesting themes, only to outright abandon them halfway through the story. She also does more damage to her own characters than Lucas did to Episodes I~III. Please take the time to FLESH OUT your creations and their motives. NOT EVERYTHING FALLS INTO A SIMPLE PATTERN.Snakecharm shows promise, but like most of her novels, that promise is dashed and destroyed by Amelia's own lack of skill.I really don't think she should write for several more years, until she can perfect her craft and not produce verbal excrement on a yearly basis. Sorry, Amelia."
3,Good Teen Read,"The second book in the Kiesha'ra series is slighty slower in pace as the first (Hawksong) but still a wonderful read. It is from Zane's POV apposed to Danica; though is isn't as fast paced, there are a lot of new characters and events that are very interesting. Such as Danica becoming pregnant amd the introduction of falcons. I reccomend this entire series for anyone who like books of the sci fi/ fantasy genre with lots of twists and turns, strong characters, and a spin on the average teen fiction book."
2,Not Charmed,"After reading Hawksong, I was thrilled to discover that Amelia Atwater-Rhodes was planning on continuing her ""Quillergy"" - an undisclosed amount of novels based on her shapeshifting world. I immediately pre-ordered Snakecharm... and was disheartened to realized it was not even 200 pages long. I often have a difficult time believing that a book can be truly worthwhile if it doesn't have more than 200 pages.I was right. Where Hawksong was a story unto itself, Snakecharm is merely a chapter. Zane Cobriana, a character I had imagined would be an intriguing character to ""get inside of"" through his narration, was surprisingly flat. The political disputes were central within this novel, and the actual tales of the characters, rather than ideals, were neglected.I have faith in Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and will continue reading her work. My only hope is that she will do her own ideas justice, and concentrate on telling a story rather than making a deadline."
1,"Worst ever, with terrible action","This Star Trek episode may have some action, but if you watch it you'll understand why it's so bad: the plot, and there's so little action. Also, the acting may be written sort of carelessly, but it's okay. Still, it doesn't change the fact that this is always going to be one of the worst. Trust me, you won't like it."
4,Great book but errors,"The textbook is a wonderful introduction to horticultural biology. The black and white format of figures is criminal but typical for all horticulture textbook publishers.Errors:p. 103, Fig. 5-6: four errors in the C-3 photosynthetic pathwayP. 104, Fig. 5-7: error regarding malate (4 carbons in bundle sheath)p. 191: gamma should be delta"
3,Book needed for on-line class my High School Junior was taking.,This book works but there is apparently a newer version that the teacher is using. I was also disappointed that we could not get this shipped overnight or second business day. Book was in good condition.
5,Give it to friends turning 50,Turning 50 rattles people. This book inspires those same people to rev up for the best years of their life. What a delight! Nothing tells a story like real stories. This is a gem filled treasure! Give it to everyone you know who turns 50.
4,Smooth As A Bone Can Get...,"This is a great CD by the one and only sax man himself Boney James. He is pure smooth jazz. This Christmas album is no exception. Although on the short side, only 9 tracks, Boney's quality in mixing R&B with typical Christmas song is wonderful and smooth. Key tracks include ""This Christmas"" and ""Sleigh Ride."""
5,The first holiday CD I've found that doesn't put me to sleep,"As the owner of a large entertainment company. I am constantly searching for ""cocktail"" music that won't put the clients to sleep.Boney has taken the traditional elevator music sound out of the classics and replaced it with the upbeat style he is famous for!"
5,The best Christmas feeling I've ever heard.,"This CD must be played by people who really loves Christmas. The feeling of the season is absolutely flowing out of the speakers. This is how I have always pictured Christmas music. The ornamentation of the instruments and the numerous numbers of chords used to fill the listening experience of this smooth jazz music must come out of love, love for the season and the love of music. I must congratulate Boney James and his musicians to this fantastic creation.I think that Boney James shows how Christmas feeling should be with Christmas Time Is Here and The Christmas Song. No one could possibly me mad, angry, exasperated, hateful or sad listening to these tunes, when the tunes themselves embrace you with Christmas love and joy./Wiken :)"
4,A Saxxy XMas!,A great CD! Boney and friends do a really nice job with the sax and Jazz renditions of popular Christmas songs!
3,Nice Holiday Music Add,Boney's holiday album is pleasant. Breaks no new ground with musical treatments but it is an upbeat take on a few Christmas classics. I am glad I have it.
4,Entertaining & helpful,"I bought this book for my 3 year old daughter. She loves anything to do with Princess's. It kept her attention which is really good and wants me to read it every night. I do think it has helped in her potty training, she is a little late because she was adopted at 19 months from an orphanage. The storyline is funny and the artwork is done well also. I would recommend this book."
3,The Princess and the Potty (Stories to go!),"Okay story. My 2 year old daughter hasn't shown as much interest in the story as I thought she would. Perhaps if she was older, she could make more connections. The pictures are fun and colorful but too small. The book is hard for little kids to hold and turn pages. 3 year old girls or older would enjoy this book much more."
2,"Cute, but not really helpul","I purchases this book hopeing it would help my daughter who is 20 months start the potty training process. It a cute book and a cute story, but doesn't explain potty training at all. This would be better for an older child who is potty training, but definatly not for a younger one."
3,Good content but too long for my 2 year old,"I bought this book in conjunction with A Potty For Me! A lift the flap instruction manual. My 2 year old definitely prefers A Potty For ME! to this book. She does like this book, but the content is much longer and she often becomes disinterested. We usually read this one before bedtime when she is a little more patient."
3,...works as advertised.,It's a hat. The color of the product in hand is a lot lighter than in the picture up on amazon.
3,Average overall.,"Pros: This is a high quality product at a reasonable price.Cons: The picture shows 4 bands, however the product is only 1. Delivery was a bit slow yet acceptable."
5,Cult calssic,This movie is way Kool. It's cheezzy but way funny if u like weird and chezzy movies. I bought it vhs but maybe someday I'll get it on dvd if I can find it.
4,DVD,"This is a twisted tale which borrows from the classic ""Gidget"" story concept, and mixes in some unique low budget horror film elements. Additionally, Charles Busch is splendid in drag as the career minded lady police detective, with a past, assigned to the misfit murder case. Lauren Ambrose (from HBOs ""Six Feet Under"") weighs in with all the charm of the original Sandra Dee character, lovingly dubbed ""Chicklet"" in this film. The surfing scenes are classicly fake and amusing. There are flashbacks and twists and turns as we explore the stories of the serial murder suspects. There is also a ""Wizard of Oz"" like ending that makes one wonder if the story was really all just a dream. Who can forget the catchy P..S..Y..C..H..O song that rolls with the ending credits and classic dancing go-go girl, reminiscent of the Frankie and Annette beach party series. This movie is bizarre enough to hold my interest and keep me watching it over and over again."
3,I had hopes for a good satire but it's not here.,"While many people say this is a decent satire of the horror/triller and beach genre I have to say overall it's a dissapointment. The ideas were very original in this flick and I give them credit for this, and some of the scenes are really good (especially the two guys wrestling on the beach) but as a overall piece of entertainment I can only say it's ok. I would only recommend it to people who are searching for this movie to fit their niche interest but casual movie go-ers probably won't enjoy."
2,MOVE OVER HEDWIG,"The ultra campy flip side of the '60s teen beach movie oeuvre. Tallish, good-looking Charles Busch wrote and starred in the stage version of this demented parody in which he played Chicklet, a beach babe with 17 personalities. In the movie, flame haired Lauren Ambrose plays the part with a controlled, finally tuned lunacy. Busch, in drag, plays police captain Monica Stark. Move over Hedwig."
2,"Delicious piffle onstage, collapsed souffle onscreen","I wanted to love this movie much more, as much as I have loved Charles Busch on stage, but, except for a few sequences (the dance-off at the beach being one of them), I found that the necessary literalization of film sat heavily on the material. It could also be that the film was not that well-directed, or that the budget simply didn't allow for a greater variety of shots or tighter editing. There's also the problem that, in these days of sitcoms like WILL & GRACE, some of the material is simply too polite. The scene in which the boozy, over-sexed housewife convinces the young stud to climb up on a ladder to change a bulb, simply fizzled out. As with so many other great shows that have become tepid films, a terrific video of a hand-selected cast performing the original script in front of a live audience, with Busch in his starring role, would have been preferable."
3,Not fun at all,"I thought this movie had a clever, funny premise and the potential to be a lot of fun, but the pointless homoerotic overtones and gross sexual humour ruined it for me. I loved Lauren Ambrose and Charles Busch, though"
2,"Mediocre overall, but some funny scenes","I was highly disappointed by this dvd and am happy I only rented it versus purchasing it based on the reviews. While I found some of the scenes funny, most of it just falls flat. As a few previous reviewers noted, this probably was much better on the stage. Actually watching an old Frankie and Annette beach party movie is more entertaining and more campy."
4,Fun to the nth degree,"A wildly fun and campy satire of the old beach movies popularized by Frankie Avalon, and of the early teen slasher movies. It's not so much about the murder mystery, but rather about the main character who keeps switching personalities. For that alone this movie was worth it! And then there's the homoeroticism, the camp value, and the zippy lines, which all make this movie just great fun."
2,Dvd defective - Would not Play.,"I saw this movie on cable & thought it was hilarious, & it was right then and there I knew I had to have it in my dvd library. Unfortunately when I ordered & received this item thru one of Amazon's third party seller the dvd would not play (I kept getting error messages). I notified Amazon about this & they in turn contacted the seller, who in turn sent me a replacement, but again, that dvd also would not play. It was right after the second defective dvd was received, I simply asked for a refund, because it was apparent the seller must have a bad batch of quantity on hand. I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for this movie."
4,Fantastic Film,"If I had to pick one movie to take with me anywhere I go, it would be this movie. It's simply the best company there is!"
2,Don't be fooled....It's not that great,"Unfortunatly, Psycho Beach Party wasn't for rent anywhere around me, so I bought it. Not a huge mistake, but I really wish I wouldn't have paid [price] for it. It had a lot of potential to be so much better. All of the actors were great but the story lacked in many ways. This movie tried way to much to parody old beach movies. If your thinking this movie has a darker edge to it due to the the supposed slasher movie parody parts don't be fooled. I thought it would be a reasonable mix between the beach movie parody and the slasher movie parody, but the beach movie parts were so overwhelming that it really took away from the story and the talent of so many great actors. Good try but no cigar for the creators of this flick. The casting person should be promoted, though."
5,This book was a magificent story and bone chillong also,The Breach was a triump of ROb Taylor the mountain cliber. It just shows how naive and ignorant we can be. Rob choose Harley to climb Mt. Kilimanjoro with him without analyzing his true character. what happend on the mountain was disaster. Fortunately Rob lived to tell about it. This book opened my eyes to ho some people wil do anything to control others!
5,A scintillating book about courage and determination.,"Rob Taylor takes you on a journey of self-doubt, the amazing recovery of the human body and throughout it all, determination. This is a heart-wrenching story about what happens when you begin to doubt yourself and wish you hadn't... I couldn't put it down and am now reading it for the third time!"
5,"GREAT, GREAT,","This is talent. Every cut is great, I got this used about 3 years back, and then my sis (Lady E, thanks I love you!) mailed me the other CD of hers. I love her music, sangin, and lyrics. I just wish she would have gotten more love, but perhaps she is happy writing songs, and collecting big checks. Anyway she is GREAT, the CD is wonderful. It's R&B, jazz, blues...all mixed up! What a great CD this is. Can not wait for another CD from Mack Diva!"
1,Particle Board Disaterous Cheap Construction Do Not Buy,"I bought this a year ago and just had to put it on the curb today. My 1st kid isn't even out of diapers. I spent the 130 dollars for this thing and thought it would be fine. WRONG. The finish was scratched right out of the box. I had to drill my own holes to put it together. Not a huge deal for me, but yeah. The bottom of the drawer is just about as sturdy as a cardboard box, and needed to be replaced. It fell out after about a week of having nothing but diapers in it. Again, I'm not scared of tools so I fixed it again. After about three months the heavy duty drawer guide/racks or whatever started to chip the cheap-o particle board right out. Then today the top piece cracked-which is when I happily threw that thing out by the road. Good riddance. Horrible, horrible, horrible product."
2,Came with the WRONG drawer rails,"This is the second stork craft aspen table I purchased. I bought the first one a year ago, and then purchased this identical one, for my second home. The first one was fine. This one I just purchased came with the WRONG drawer rails installed. The drawer rails only went about 13"" long, when the drawer is 16"" long. what this means is when you try to shut the freaking damn drawer, it won't shut. i had to go to home depot and shell out $5 to replace the drawer rails with 16"" rails. once i did this, the drawers closed. i'd also like to point out this furniture isn't easy to assemble. the holes don't match up. i have built a lot of furniture but this piece was awful. i was so upset! i don't recommend buying this again! i couldnt be bothered to call stork craft to complain about it!"
2,Very Disappointed!!,"I am extremely disappointed with this changing table. The drawer is very shallow and doesn't open and close right. The height of the table is pretty low for a changing table. I thought the open concept was great for using baskets underneath, but the lip on the shelves makes it difficult to pull the baskets out. I was very excited about this changing table but when I put it together I was very disappointed."
3,Ok but somewhat disappointed,We got this for our vacation home. It's definitely not cheap and a brand with a good reputation. But a couple if wood pieces were damaged and hardware was missing so I had to call for replacement parts. It was pretty easy to put together. Finish is very soft and dents easily so be careful. Glad we got it but I honestly expected better quality for a Stork Craft product.
3,Drawer didn't last but otherwise ok,"Have owned this almost 2 years and within a few months of use, the drawer was falling apart. Then it would no longer stay on the rollers. We continue to use it but took the drawer out. We cloth diaper and we use media baskets from Target on the bottom shelf in a single layer to hold things. We have 2 layers of stacking baskets on the top shelf. We have a diaper stacker tied off one side. We have a large wet bag attached to the other end. So far besides the crummy drawer, it has worked well for us."
4,Solid Piece,"Despite many varying reviews from other buyers, my wife and I thought this was a great product for the price and took a chance. We were right. The directions were very simple, all pieces accounted for, no damaged pieces, and I put it together alone in about an hour. It's quite solid, aside from a little wiggle in the drawer. No scratched paint on the wood pieces. The comments about the shelves being flimsy are really not an issue for us since we're not storing lead bricks on them. They're plenty sufficient for diapers, towels, clothes, etc. We would recommend to anyone."
3,Lives up to its description,"We purchased this table shortly after our daughter's birth and have been satisfied with the quality for the money. It's sturdy and has held up well. One consideration that I wish I would have thought of though is that the open shelves are only good for storage until your baby is mobile. Now that our daughter is pulling herself up on furniture, we can no longer store anything under the table. She pulls everything off and tosses it around the room. I wish we'd spent a little more and bought a changing table with enclosed storage underneath."
2,"Pretty, but not practical","The drawyer broke within a month of use and we only had about ten baby outfits folded inside of it. The problem is that it's very light and flimsy. It comes off the rollers easily and the thin particle board bottom of the drawyer comes out of the slide in brackets easily. I have now had to hot glue the drawyer twice and at 18 months it's still kicken, but won't be any use for a second baby.The part where you change the baby is very sturdy however and the shelves are very sturdy. We have tons of blankets stuffed in the bottom and have not had any problems with that.Yes it's very pretty...but not practicle if you want it to last for more than one child."
3,Not built to last,"I've used this changing table for almost 2 yrs with my son. It is attractive and has functioned pretty well overall. The drawer bottom (flimsy; almost like cardboard) sags and pops easily out of the grooves and this is very annoying. The same thing is happenning with our stork craft aspen crib drawer bottoms which have had very little weight in them. I also would like to have more room on the changing table; now that my son is bigger his head hits the bars on the sides. This table is standard size though, and I've used 2 different changing pads with it and they both fit."
4,table,it took two of us to put this together. I thought the shelves could have been made out of sturdier material. My granddaughter loves the changing table.
2,Nice looking piece of furniture but Storkcraft has extremely bad quality control,"This aspen changing table looks very nice in our baby's room. Having the drawer is a very nice feature. This changing table was the only piece of Storkcraft furniture that we ordered that came virtually undamaged. We also ordered a Storkcraft crib, 5 drawer dresser, 3 drawer dresser and combo hutch ~ all of which arrived damaged. I would never order any furniture made my Storkcraft again. The quality control is absolutely horrible and not worth all the trouble."
3,changing table I'd like to change,"Did not enjoy putting this together. Directions did not really explain ""How To"".Pictures didn't help.Was a challenge for my husband and I to put together.(To the woman who did it herself at 8 and a half months-Good for you...don't know how you did it!)Directions also gave wrong screw info as screws did not fit in some wholes they were assigned to. Difficult to keep boards aligned exactly. Will be ordering more screws from the company as we need about 4 more to align it all proper.We still have to install the drawer which I am not looking forward to!!Final point, once it is put together it looks nice, I just hope it will hold out and be sturdy enough. Way too much of a pain to return so my fingers are crossed.I wouldn't recommend this to others.Search again for better product!Happy Holidays!"
4,"Nice table, tough assembly","We ordered this table through walmart.com and recieved it in less than a week. The table looks beautiful once put together but we did have a small problem. The plastic dowels that are used to hold things together are too big to fit into the holes they are supposed to go in. My husband shaved down the plastic to make them fit and then everything was fine. I just viewed it as a bit of an inconveniece. But, the table is a ""beautiful"" piece and was worth the extra work. Also, this piece goes ""very"" well with the rochester stages crib which is a bit cheaper than the aspen stages crib. We put the two pices together and no one would ever know that they aren't a set."
1,DO NOT BUY,I ordered this table and it arrived damaged. I sent it back and received a replacement 3 weeks later which was more damaged than the first delivery. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!! It is poorly manufactured. There were puddles of clear coat varnish on the sides and top and there were serious gouges in the wood that the people at Storkcraft tried to fill and restain with NO SUCCESS!!!!! This is a shoddy product. Do not waste your time or money!
3,Nice but could be better!!,This changing table is nice but the shelves at the bottom have off white bottoms (not expresso color). The picture is deceiving. We would not have bought this piece if we knew that because I thought the whole table would be the expresso color. The off-white shelving throws the whole look off. It was however easy to put together.
1,Poor Quality and Breaks Easily!,"I ordered this changing table because I liked the way it looked and the price was low. But I learned my lesson that you get what you pay for! The item arrived on time which was nice and we started to assemble it. First off, the quality is very cheap looking and the shelves are nothing more than flimsy pieces of cardboard. During assembly by husband was screwing in one of the sides and the actual base of the changing tables legs broke off. You could tell that it had been glued on so I am not sure if this was a previously returned item or if Storkcraft uses glue to attach things! Either way, I would not feel comfortable laying my baby on this for fear that the whole thing might fall apart. Think twice before purchasing this item!"
2,Wouldn't buy again,"This changing table has served the basic purpose of being a table to place my son on to change him, but it's very poorly made.The drawer constantly falls off track and drops down, so I just never use it. The middle shelf can't hold much weight at all, like a few stacks of diapers and some wipes, before it starts to bow down. It looks like it's about to fall through. But that shelf is just made of particle board. Thin particle board.I am a bit disappointed with the quality of this changing table. I guess I should have bought a more expensive, higher quality table in order to avoid having to buy another when we have our next child."
1,Lisa,"Do not purchase Storkcraft products. I checked everything and Storkcraft rated so well in safety, but getting a product that looks new is impossible. We have to keep returning our Storkcraft products because they are shipped broken. The pieces that are not broken are poor quality - for example, the finish is sloppy and does not cover the whole piece. Unless you want to pay full price for a nursery that looks like it was put together from a cheap garage sale, stay way from Storkcraft. This may be why Babys R Us does not carry much of this anymore."
3,Shipping and changing table review,"The only thing that I found wrong with this so far is that when I recieved it, it was broke. The left hand bar at the end of the table was broke, and the dowel was stuck in the spot wher it should have been. My husband had to bore out the spot where it should be placed and then replace the dowels. It looked like someone had previously had the changing table and returned it and they sent it out to whom ever ordered it again next."
1,Save your money,"I received this changing table damaged (gouges in the wood) and also the finish was uneven on many pieces. In addition, the changing table's height is too low for both my husband and I. We are 5'8"" and would have had to really stoop to use this table. Buyer beware!"
2,Must be handy,"I give this changing table 2 stars for looks only. My husband had to re-drill several holes as the ones pre-drilled did not line up correctly. Maybe we just got a bad table, but it was more trouble than it was worth. The crib was easier to assemble than this."
3,"Nice finished product, but getting there was tough!!!","I will start with this. The finished product is quite nice for the money. There were some flaws in the finish, but, nothing a little scratch cover can't fix. The directions were very confusing and you had to read ahead 3 steps in order to understand the previous steps. It took me several hours, should have only taken a few hours. I have assembled so many items big and small. This one looks simple, but, it wasn't. Once I got it all together, polished it and added some final touches, it looked pretty nice. Be very careful putting the drawer together, the material breaks easily during this phase of assembly. The pad is very thin, you might want to consider a thicker one."
2,Disappointing product,"I bought this changing table when my daughter was born (1/06). It matched the Aspen cherry crib that we'd bought and were very happy with. However, the drawer on this changing table hasn't opened or shut smoothly since my daughter was about 2 months old. It quickly began to fall off the track and was more trouble than it was worth. We dumped it when my son was born and are glad to be free of the aggravation."
1,Awful (Not even worth the 1 star!),"This was one of the worst movies I have ever attempted to watch. I had to TURN IT OFF. I love the Vandals, which is why I wanted to see it. In result, it made punk in general look ridiculous! Some of these bands should stick to making music, when they go off and try to make a movie as horrible as this, it makes their fans take a second look at who they are all about! Now Suburbia is a good movie, low budget - yes, but a good punk movie. The acting is bad, but the acting in ""That Darn Punk"" was just something to plain laugh at, before you turn the thing OFF!"
4,How people really are when we're not looking ...,"Hilariously written and poorly acted, this episodic tale trounces through the weird and the wonderful. Although the movie clearly suffers from its budget being an afterthought, it has moments of sheer brilliance in how it captures the assortment of humanity we meet. I'm particularly fond of ""Spoons"" and the Japanese phone lady. Oh, yeah, and the pregnant junkie hooker. The soundtrack rocks, but you knew that already, didn't you?"
4,a must buy...right now...,"I saw this cd and wanted to get it right away. It has everything from classic songs like Aliens (Pennywise), GGF (Rancid), and After You My Friend (Lagwagon) to new recorded songs ,Roy (Nerf Herder), Only You (No Motiv), and Right on Q (The Vandals), which right now can be found nowhere else. Beyond this, is even more unreleased songs from Kung Fu bands like The Ataris and Assorted Jelly Beans, and sneak peaks at upcoming Kung Fu bands like MI-6, Antifreeze and our unbelievable newest signing, OZMA. This cd is a must buy for anyone."
4,"Casbah Falafel, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)","Though the taste and aroma of this Falafel is wonderful, it seemed a bit crumbly. I think it would taste far better if it was a little less dry. I will have to play with it to see what I can do with the dry and crumbly texture. The regular homemade Falafel does not present the same problem. I may update this review once I am finished seeing what I can do with it to make it more homemade tasting and more moist."
2,Ehhh there's nothing great about this record,"Well I must say that I am disappointed. I bought the ""Rock Against Bush"" comp that Fat Mike released, and heard None More Black's song on that album.. which was quite good. So I went to the music store and bought their album.I wish I downloaded it before buying it, because there's only a couple songs on the cd that are any good. The first two songs are pretty good, I enjoy them.. but after a few minutes, all the songs start to sound exactly the same and the vocalist becomes EXTREMELY annoying.I'm not one of those teeny pop-punk kids, I enjoy alot of underground hardcore punk bands.. but this cd isnt that good. They've offered nothing new to music. Its just average punk that everyone has heard before."
2,NMB Cocktail,NMB Cocktail2 parts Dillinger Four1 part Kid Dynamite1 part Nobody's (strained of porn)Pour above ingredients into a cocktail pitcher and take to the heart of the pit. Shake or stir with your style as you mosh. Pour into large shot glasses and float with a shot of Fat Mike snottiness and 'tude. Share with your friends. Brilliant!
5,Very good smartcharger,"Have used one of these for years and finally bought a second.Light, compact, fast, very simple to use and will not overcharge your batteries.Dual voltage capable, so all you need is the proper plug converter to use it anywhere in the world.The auto adapter is also a universal way to re-charge your AA or AAA batteries."
1,Don't be fooled. Terrible product. Do not buy it !!!,"Bought this charger in a kit, (by the way, products in the picture are not the same as the ones deliverd in the kit, be careful with kits). The charger never worked, batteries never got warm as an indication of charging. Lights never turned on as another indication of the charging process. The only thing that was useful was the car cable and the plug adapter. You can pay actually less in Walmart for a Duracell battery carger which works great for less price. I was able to get a refund enough to go get my Duracell battery charger."
4,WONDERFUL,"Very good book, it covers just three days in the whole thing, but you always want to finish it in one setting. I highly recomend this book."
5,A great new book from the American Diaries series.,"Twelve-year-old Janey, her parents, and her four-year-old brother Michael have left their home in Kansas to live on the Hawaiian Island of Oahu. It's December 1941, and Janey's father, a welder, has been hired by the military to work at Hickman Airfield, near Pearl Harbor. Janey loves the beauty of her new home, but she is terrified by the threat of war between the United States and Japan, which could lead to an invasion of Hawaii. On the peaceful Sunday morning of December 7, without warning, Japanese planes attack. Janey and her mother and brother are separated from her father. They are forced to evacuate their home, but Janey is determined to return - because she knows in her heart that her father can't be dead, and that she will see him again. This was an excellent new book in the American Diaries series that captured the terror of the day Pearl Harbor was attacked, as faced by the many civilian families living on the island."
5,Amazingly Good,"It is a really good album, I bought it on a whim because I liked his past hits. I never thought it whould have been so nice. Really good mix of songs, A must buy for any fan of R&B."
3,Bird Cage Cover,This product was ordered by mistake. It was returned unopened therefore i can't make any comments about it.
2,A not-too-good book by a god author,"The book seemed slow and un involving unlike the other books in Saberhagam's Berserker series. It was also hampered by the effect of a bad ending that left you thinking ""Huh? um, ok.... Let's go read a half-way decent Star Wars/Trek novel."" Sorry, but it just wasn't a good book."
1,"help, please","The anti-Chan Clan must be in back of this release as these are films that rate from bad to terrible. The Fox films that are labeled ""politically incorrect"" are the great ones and Fox has capitulated to misguided Asian Americans. Wait for their release, though it may be a very long wait."
2,Not the films I remember.,"I became a fan of Sidney Toler as Charlie Chan when a local TV station started playing a different Chan movie every Saturday night. I was particularly fond of a mysterious episode where the people around Chan were dying one at a time, to which he would remind the survivors that ""dead men tell no secrets"". Well, the six movies in the Chanthology (clever title) are not those late-night movies I remember. Apparently the Chan movies were released by two different studios. One studio made good movies, one made bad ones. Guess which ones these are? Release the ones with Jimmy!"
5,Chantology Charlie Chan (Sidney Toler),"I haven't seen Charlie Chan in years, so I was absolutly delighted. Sidney Toler is my favorite. I would like to know if there are any other Sidney Toler Charlie Chan movies. If someone could let me know I would appreciate it. If you like Charlie Chan you will love Chantology."
5,Chanthology: Delivered as Promised,Amazon delivered this product earlier than promised. Each of the DVDs ran flawlessly. I am a Chan fan so I am delighted to add these DVD-based movies to my collection. The sound & picture quality are very fine.
5,charlie chan,"I bought the Charlie Chan Chanthology. I have watched 3 of the 6 movies so far. The movies bring bach so much memories. All the movies are of the best quality and sound, just as any other new movie you would buy today."
2,Chanthology,"For lovers of the Charlie Chan movies, this set is a mixed blessing. The transfers were done with evident care and attention. However, the quality of the movie, in some cases, was not worth it. I compared ""Murder At Midnight"" with a Tape of the same movie. The sound and video of the DVD really made a difference, but the movi itself was still very predictable and the character were portrayed as shallow. The other movies in the collection proved to be better in quality of scripting and acting. This collection is for Chan addicts, but not of much interest to others. The Secret Service was one of the better selections. The story line was taut, witty, and believable."
4,Enough with the Warner Oland comparisons already,"Yeah, yeah. I know these movies aren't supposed to be in the same league with the Warner Oland films of the 30's but there's one thing these movies have that those movies didn't-Mantan Moreland. Has there been a funnier character than Birmingham Brown in any series. Well, maybe Kramer or Ed Norton, but I'd put Birmingham on the short list.And Sidney Toler doesn't get enough credit for reviving the franchise and serving as an able Chan. In fact, his Chan is edgier than Oland's in some respects, which better serves the mood in some cases.No complaints here."
3,"Charlie Chan, finally in DVD...","For fans of the B-grade 1940's detective thrillers, Honolulu Police Detective Charlie Chan has finally made the jump from VHS to DVD format with this initial offering of six short films from 1944 and 1945, featuring Sidney Tolar in the title role as the legendary sleuth.The many Charlie Chan movies would barely pass muster today, with a Caucasian actor portraying the astute detective, and a formulaic approach helped along by Chinese proverbs and pre-CSI detective work. These six episodes are perhaps not the best examples of the genre. Dedicated Charlie Chan fans await the conversion of some of the older episodes from the early 1940s. Nevertheless, these Charlie Chan movies are good harmless fun and a time capsule of murder mysteries on film during the Second World War."
5,IT's about time!!!!,"It's about time they FINALLY start bringing back the Chan movies. I really feared in this age of PC and tree hugging liberals, that these movies would not be released. These are CLASSICS. Unfortunately there are only 8 movies released; but, it is a start.The DVDs are full screen. While some would complain that widescreen should be used, I 100% disagree. Remember the colorization DISASTER?!?! Exactly. Fans want these movies exactly as they were released. No added color, and no editing the format.MGM did a fantastic job preserving these movies. (They even have the pitch for war bonds at the end of one of them.) We can only hope that the rest will be released someday by MGM and the other studios."
4,Only for the hard-core Carver fan.,"Most of these stories, I had never read, with the exception of 'So Much Water So Close to Home'. If you are a Carver fan, get this book. But, if you're new to him, you might want to get 'What We Talk About, When we Talk About Love'. Anyway, a good book, and resonably priced. 6.00, Cheap at twice the price."
4,"It's 1080i, not 1080p.","It's hard to complain about this blu-ray, because it looks great.Having said that, I must point out that it says right there on the box, ""Full HD"". Well if you consider 1080i to be ""Full HD"", then that statement is true, but personally I believe that any blu-ray claiming to be ""Full HD"" should be nothing less than 1080p.I bought this for the purpose of getting the absolute maximum visual clarity out of my system, and so that I could demonstrate the advantage of high definition. But now, whenever I play this disc for someone I will have to add the caveat, ""But remember, as good as this looks, it's only 1080i, not full 1080p."""
1,"BAD, worst, Terrible ! DONT BUY !","Hi Guys, I bought this series, 4 Blu rays, for one friend in Brazil. I opened one just to see if was good enough, also I bought more 20 Blu rays of others series, like Scenic series and OVER series.To be honestly when I started wacthing the first one: Earthscapes Pacific Coast, I thought that my Blu Ray player was freeze or not running anymore. The images stayed still forever on the same place, there are no edition, the Camera Man, just set up the camera on a tripod and let it there, I wonder that maybe He went to restroom ! Lol... OMG.I ended up return all the 4 blue rays, and had to pay shipment and other stuff.Don't BUY !!!now Senic Series and OVER series are PERFECT.Whander - San Francisco Bay Area. CA."
5,Brilliant work and inspiring,"A classic of the genre, makes the case for seeing data through the lens of good writing and a good story. Controversial in that he dismisses concerns about validity or generalizability ... which is okay with me. If you're in the middle of a long research slog, this will inspire you to good, fascinated work."
4,King of the Road,"I normally cringe at cover versions of well-known (and well-done the first time) songs, but ""King of the Road"" is great without trying too hard to be new, or trying too hard to slavishly copy Roger Miller."
5,Killer!!!!!,"We used to live in Milwaukee, near where Classique Fare is HQ'd. We moved to California, only to realize how good we had it! Nothing compares. All other mixes should be outlawed - or at least flagged for being crappy!"
3,Good but not Great,"Percy's Ghostly Trick is just okay. I didn't really like that story very much because I don't like Percy, but I'm sure Percy fans would love singing Percy as a ghost who scares Thomas, therefore I'd recommend this one to all Percy fans. Anyway, here are the stories:Percy's Ghostly Trick CWolly Bear AThomas & Percy Mountain Adventure AEscape BOliver Owns Up BAll at Sea AAlso in this one Thomas has his first music video which is good, very catchy, and still to this day is one of the best one.Final Score:7 out of 10"
1,Scary version of the tv episodes.,The characters are really mean to each other. They say and do mean things. We don't want our child seeing this behavior.

5,Silvia Pinal and Sara Garcia,Hard to believe there is only one other 5 star review here. I would go even further than the other reviewer (as I think Silvia is just delicious in this) and call it a flawless film. Could not be better. A #1. Top shelf. Really. (romantic comedy)
4,Wonder How Nasa Feels?,"NASA must be pretty bemused that a Japanese chocolate is named after and shaped like their Apollo craft. It is amazing how things can be marketed using some completely unconnected with it. Having said that, these little Apollo shaped things are very good.They might strike one as being sickeningly sweet, but like most things Japanese, they are not. One would be forgiven for exercising caution, but I don't think they are overdone on the sweetness side.Combining strawberry and chocolate is an age old recipe, but Meiji have done it well this time. I thoroughly enjoy these whenever I can get them, but there are others that I would prefer. These, however, are more than good enough as a stop-gap measure for my real addictions."
3,Hot Weather,The Meiji Strawberry chocolates were extremely tasty! Be sure not to order them in the summer. Mine were completely melted together and I had to cut strawberry/chocolate blobs to munch on. Other than no cooling in packaging and it being the middle of summer the product was yummy.
3,Confused teen on a lazy river,"It isn't clear what motivates our boy. If it is lust, it is a lazy river lust. He cruises a gay pick-up spot but rejects the advances of an adult, but only after following him to a motel room. He then cruises a teen haunt and pals with a mixed race guy who harbors his own demons. They steal his family's boat and have an adventure, but never truly connect. In the end there is a murder and a shower scene in the nude, but they only add to the confusing, surreal tale that is The Delta. Haunting, but in a lazy, Delta sort of way."
1,Confusion set in the south?,This indie film certainly sets the gay movement back about 30 years where all gay men are either sraight and confused or end up as a villian. When the two lead male characters got together I was looking forward to the growth of a relationship. Once the firework scene ended and the chase began I knew I was doomed. The ending clearly certified for me that this one has no gay pride.
1,$25+ for this rubbish?,"If you like light entertaining movies this is not for you. If you like interesting characters this is not for you. If you like an interesting plot this is not for you. The creator of this rubbish even imagines he is an oscar winning cinematographer - and with his cruddy camera, film and scenery he clearly is not anywhere near to being that. Don't pay more than $3."
3,Provocative but incomplete,"The film's twist on the Huckleberry Finn/American West motif is well-done and commendable. Similarly, the burgeoning relationship between the two young men is initially well-dramatized. However, Minh's character lacks development, and potential dramatic use of his disenfranchisemnt (half-black, half-Vietnamese, gay, poor) is unexplored. Minh's character arc lands him the only place he could end up: risking what little he has to avenge his abandonment. Yet we are left wondering the complete reasoning behind his decision, and, in fact, we do not know Minh's name until the movie is almost over. Without due psychological exploration of Minh, the movie's pace is jerky and the film left being somewhat cryptic, which would be to the film's credit if it seemed intentional."
4,Love Stinks,"A compelling character study -- revolving around the confused relationship between a 17-year-old Memphis student and a slightly older Vietnamese immigrant -- that makes for a fascinating tale of sexual, social and racial differences and injustices. Lincoln (Grey) is a darkly handsome youth who, though having a girlfriend, cruises the city's parks after dark for furtive sexual encounters with other men. There, and later in a peep show store, he meets Minh, a talkative but somewhat troubled young man and the son of a black GI and a Vietnamese woman. Minh takes a liking to the shy Lincoln and they soon set up a strange, quasi-sexual friendship that quickly results in a boat ride deep down the Mississippi Delta in a modern Tom and Huck adventure. These two opposites -- Lincoln, the privileged white teen, and Minh, the poor foreigner -- form a bond that inevitably leads to trouble... Love stinks!"
1,unwatchable,"Technically speaking, both the sound and picture quality are very substandard. In my opinion so was the plot which gives new meaning to ""slow moving."""
3,Pretty Good!!!,"I thought this movie was okay. It starts off slow, then it gets a little better with more action and gunplay. Cuba Gooding Jr. and Miguel Ferrer star as two mafia partners named Joshua and Vincent. When they kill a drug dealer named Frankie Tahoe, they are soon targeted by a powerful crime boss named Nino. I'd probably recommend WRONG TURN AT TAHOE!!!"
3,Surprisingly not bad,"What is this you say, a Cuba Gooding Jr-starring straight to DVD film that actually isn't bad? That's what you get with Wrong Turn at Tahoe, in which Gooding stars as Joshua, the protege of small time crime boss Vincent (Miguel Ferrer). When Vincent kills drug dealer Frankie Tahoe (Noel Gugliemi) without realizing that he works for uber-crime lord Nino (Harvey Keitel), the blood and bullets start to fly. No holds barred in its violence, Wrong Turn at Tahoe is pretty much a pastiche of every better crime movie to come before it. That aside though, the film works thanks to its stars, and Gooding definitely gives the best performance probably since Men of Honor. The real surprise here however is Ferrer, who's appeared in everything from Robocop to Traffic to Crossing Jordan over the years, and here's hoping that he gets more leading roles down the line."
4,GOOD TURN AT TAHOE,i'm a cuba gooding and miguel ferrer fan and they were both great in this film. i also liked harvey keitel in this movie. this was very entertainig and not your typical mob film. i hate it when people give reviews and spoil the plot for you by basically telling you the story line. i don't do that but i will tell you it's worth seeing especially if you like mob films and the three actors i mentioned above.
4,watching movies with the Silver Surfer,Pretty Good Crime Thriller Movie..cuba gooding jr isn't playing romeo in this one..good to see a brother display diverse acting talent
4,Not his best but am a huge fan of Cuba Gooding Jr.,I will watch again but not my favorite of Cuba's. He can say more with a look that most people can with a lot of words.
5,Great!,"i never thought id see the day where my hatch went up by itself! but these supports are plenty strong, and look to be a great product!"
5,StrongArm 4952L Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatch Lift Support (L) 1995-9...,Purchased this for my 1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse GST. Very easy to install and works perfectly. Highly recommend for anyone with this vehicle.
2,Not exactly a nightmare...,"My main gripe with this novel is the reason the two lovers could not be together. In Taming the Heiress, there was a bit of folklore and superstition that caused real world problems and how the characters felt about what happened was complex and engaging. I was looking forward to the next in this series but was profoundly disappointed. I skipped a lot because the plot line seems forced and the secondary characters were uninteresting. It was almost like there was a different writer (or editor?) working on this book. The lovers' first physical encounter was insulting - and in this era, hard to believe - he was no gentleman, that's for sure."
3,Personified Drama,"The book was well-written, although the story at times was very far-fetched. Centered on the lives of three females who became friends thanks to the same man they were all sleeping with.Each female narrates their own version of their personal life, but the details at times seemed fantasized. The author write each female narrator with excitement and flare; causing you to read on.You'll love the book for the drama. It has an alternative ending; which I prefer ending number one - on the realistic side.Star Rating: *** 3.5"
5,Super durable,"Our lab loves this ball, bounces like crazy after throwing it. Thrown with a ChuckIt, this ball, with the bounce easily goes 100 feet further than a tennis ball, even a new one.Easy to see on grass, or anywhere. Easy to clean.He's had two for 6 months now, still holding up well. He chews on it, but it doesn't hurt the ball - YET."
5,Awesome!,These are well worth buying if you have a pooch who loves a good game of fetch. My dog can take a tennis ball apart in under 15 minutes but so far we have logged a few hours on these and they show no sign of wear. They are super bouncy and as an added bonus they don't get all slobbery like regular tennis balls. They work great with the chuck-it. I highly recommend these.**Update-Believe it or not we still have some of the chuckit balls hanging around that were purchased 3-4 years ago. They have faded a little bit but are still bouncing strong. Worth every penny!
3,Small Hollow Rubber Ball,"Finding a really bouncy rubber ball for my Golden is a challenge. Most balls are either hollow, don't bounce well and damage easily or are too dense and probably painful for the dog when he catches it.These balls bounce alright and my Golden loves them yet has not been able to destroy one yet. So they're durable. This is good.But the ball is hollow. So eventually he will damage it, guaranteed.The best ball I have seen yet is solid but not overly dense. The bounce rocks and my dog loves it. I got it for free by buying some dog treats.So this ball is decent but not as special as I hoped. Also, one of the two arrived with a small air leak. It hisses when I compress it. The other does not have this problem.Better than most but still not the best, this is worth a try if you don't already have a good source of balls your dog likes."
5,One Tough Ball,My lab has chewed up every toy I ever bought him. He even chews Kong toys to bits!! But not these Chuckit balls. I watch him day after day lay in his kennel and chew on these ball. He even gnaws on the seams with his front teeth. They are virtually indestructable.
5,Very durable!!,"I have 2 Weimaraners, one of which is very destructive with her toys. She will have a tennis ball ripped to shreds within 2 minutes and she literally eats plush toys. I have tried so many toys that are said to be ""indestructible"" and have had no luck. These balls have been amazing so far. She has been playing with them for about 2 weeks and has yet to destroy them. I also love them because they are so easy to clean. Nothing is worse than going to the park and your tennis ball is covered in slobber and mud by the time you leave. I will definitely be purchasing more of these!!"
5,Dog's favorite toy,"After all the squeak toys have bitten the dust, only one toy remains supreme. The ChuckIt! My dog lives for this ball. She plays with it over all her other toys day in and day out. My dog was never one to play with tennis balls for some reason, but just cannot get enough of the ChuckIt. It also stands up to her chewing on it and o me throwing it. It's easy to clean with a wet paper towel."
5,indestructable toy,We have a golden retriever who loves to play fetch and her favorite ball is the chuckIt ultra ball. Our golden destroys about every toy she has ever owned but these balls have outlasted her jaws. I would say these balls would outlast about any dog! I am very impressed
5,best ball ever,"our dog loves playing ball, but she is a chewer. these are the best balls we found for her to fetch and then chew her whole way back. hold up great. we only buy new when they get lost which is the only way we've gone through them."
5,Love this ball!,We LOVE these balls! I have two large dogs (Akita & Akita/Mastiff mix) and they are truly destructive with toys or really anything else they decide to play with. We have had these balls for over a month now and they're still intact! They're wearing down but it is truly miraculous for any toy to last this long with our chewers plus they just love to play with them as they're quite bouncy and good for playing fetch. I wish the balls were a little bigger but I'll definitely buy more once these eventually give out.
5,the best balls ever,"If you have a dog that likes to play fetch, stop what you are doing now and order the balls and the chucker thrower. The balls are great outdoors or inside. Make sure that you get the balls with the rubber finish. Some pet stores sell the balls that look like the chucker balls, but they have a fuzzy tennis ball finish.......not as good."
5,Favorite,My dog LOVES THESE.. He doesn't care for the regular tennis balls and the good thing about these is since they are rubber they don't get. Soggy and hold dirt like regular tennis balls!
5,Best ball ever!,"My year-old Belgian Malinois chews EVERYTHING. She chews the fuzz off of tennis balls. She chews up rubber balls. She chews blankets and pillows and anything left within reach. She chews apart dog toys that are supposed to be for strong chewers. But this ball is indestructible! It bounces great, which she loves, and she can chew on it all day long. We've had two of them several weeks and there's not a nick out of either of them. Finally - a product that works!"
3,"Toys great! Beef tendon chews, not so much!","Loved te toys! I've got two 10 month old retriever mix dogs (80 lbs each!) and the toys have worked out great!! I'm impressed with the balls as they love to chew on them and they are still in one piece! Ropes too!However, I will never get the beef tendon chews as they went through one of them alone in 10-20 minutes and at the end, my puppies had soft bowel movements and lots of gas!! These guys tolerate rawhides do good, but these beef tendons did a number for smelly gas and soft stool. Luckily, they were back to normal after 48 hrs."
3,do not use tennis balls,"Never let your dog play with tennis balls... they will wear down their teeth. These rubber balls are safe, but a dog with powerful jaws will destroy them fairly quickly, so be prepared to buy lots of them."
3,Chuck it,My 8 month old lab ate the balls and then proceeded to chew up the chuck it tosser. She is very rough on toys.
5,indestructible so far,"my neighbors dog destroys all the balls they buy. then they dont have anything to play with in between new balls being bought.i got these for the dog and the neighbors were saying he would destroy it in no time, i said i dont know... the reviews are people saying their dog destroys all balls but not this one!sure enough a month later the balls are in perfect shape(of course other than some dirt and slobber!) there are no teeth marks, no holes, color is still perfect.not to mention that its (so far) not able to be damaged, its light, super bouncy, and the bright orange helps me spot it. i love throwing it off the fence and it bounces far the other way and the dog loves it too.buy these u wont regret it!!! i just spent $6 and they may never need a new ball again, or if they do it will be YEARS"
5,7 mo. male pitbull,My 7 month pitt goes through tennis balls like its nothing. My pup lovessss playing with the ChuckIt and it has lasted way longer than any of his tennis balls. Definitely worth buying.
4,Good Balls,"I have bought several of these and they have lasted the best of any balls I have tried. They are not chew proof, my 28 pound Jackwiener (Jack Russell wiener dog) can pop out a round spot after using these awhile (a few days). But he is an exceptional chewer and has chewed off the top of a Kong. Tennis balls last about ten minutes with him. He loves these and loves to catch them on the bounce."
5,Perfect for fetching,"I bought Chuckit! Ultra Ball to substitute Petco's tennis balls which didn't last long (usually my dog chewing on them split them in half in matter of days). I bought this along with 2 other kinds of Chuckit! balls (the sky-blue whistle kind and the yellow-green erratic kind). This is my favorite. Bounces just right compared to the other ones, and its bright color makes it perfect for use in my backyard when grasses get taller. I am definitely getting a dozen more of this."
5,My German Shepherd loves these.,My German Shepherd loves these balls. We have purchased these for years and has never popped one even though he tests them constantly in his jaw. He usually loses them in the yard and even if they are uncovered months later they are dirty but still durable. I recommend this product for any one with a large dog who loves to play catch and fetch.
5,Perfect,My dog was amazed. Good product for a very good price.I could never find this quality in Brazil.I recommend for everybody who loves dogs.
3,ok,my picky dogs are not crazy about the ruff texture withch picks up dirt leaves and you know what off my list
5,The Very Best Play Balls! nearly indestructible!,"These ultra balls bounce well, last a long time, wash off well when dirty & messy from play, and are easy to find when my dog & I lost them. They are not like tennis balls which are easily deflocked by my dog. These are the very best!"
1,Not indestructible...,"Our lab had this ball ripped apart in less than a week. I was hopeful after reading other reviews that it would last, but alas, back to the drawing board..."
1,dozer,wouldn't u think labeling the balls ultra they would be the best and biggest u could get? Wrong! !!! Need different labeling like small- med- LG? people would know what size balls they were buying?
1,too heavy for fun!!,these balls were way more heavier than regular tennis balls. my jack russell did not care for them.
5,My pets love this ball,This is the best ever ball for medium to large size dogs. My pet will walk around for hours with this in his mouth. I don't have to worry about him chewing off the fuzz as he does with tennisballs. It's great for playing catch. It's virtually indestructable and easy to keep clean.
5,Second only to Kong in durability,"My dachshund, Rojito, is an amazingly aggressive chewer. Toys other than his red Kongs are destroyed within the first half hour after I bring them home. A friend recommended these Ultra Balls and I'm so thankful! Ro chews on this ball for hours at a time. It is hallow, so if he bites down on it hard enough the sound of the air escaping from it sets him off the way a squeaky toy would - without the risk of him diengaging and swallowing a squeaker. They are supposed to float, so we will be taking it to the dog beach with us. Between these and his Kong ball and jack, I can finally rotate toys for him and keep him safe and happy. I'd give these 6 stars, if I could!"
1,TERRIBLE,"TERRIBLE BRA. WHAT I MISTAKE I MADE THINKING THIS WOULD WORK OUT FOR ME.TERRIBLE FIT, NOT MADE FOR DD CUPS OR FOR THAT MATTER ANYONE OVER A B CUP....VERY DISAPPOINTED....."
3,"Music good, video not as good","The progressive trance music is very good. The visual effects, for the most part, are no more exciting or advanced than a collection of WinAMP plugins. There are also some chapters (especially the two done by ""Madame Chao"") which make liberal use of seizure inducing--or at least headache inducing--flash strobing. This DVD is much more geared towards the DJ/Dance Party than casual watching. The music (and included audio CD) are great for any-time background trance music. Music 4.5 stars, visuals, 2 stars."
1,Saty away from secondspin,"I ordered 1 DVD from this place almost a month ago and have yet to get it. It is way past the due date and their response has been: '""Too bad, so sad"". Emails take forever and phone numbers are not to be found. Let the buyer beware! I will now look for other ways to purchase things away from amazon and secondspin. Ridiculous!!i really wanted to select NO STARS!"
5,More digitally Hardcore then anything on DHR,"This is it, fast hard and electronic what Digital Hardcore should be. Its a very soild fast tempo release, sometimes drifting over to noise rock. Fans of music such as Atari teenage roit, Naplam death, The Shizit, Alec Empire, or ANY other hardcore music should diffently not hesitate to buy,burn,or ... this album. You will not regrete it."
4,No problems,I am no expert when it comes to sound or video quality but I have been using my cables to watch movies from my laptop on my tv. The only reason for not giving all 5 stars was just because it took almost 2 weeks to receive the cables but other than that they work great and seem to be a quality product.
5,basic principles of healthy diet,"This is a wonderful book for learning the basics of nutrition. Dr. Morter exposes the protein myth and explains quite thoroughly the effects of alkaline verses acid producing foods on the body. He provides a guided tour that goes through all the digestive organs of the body showing how they are affected by an acid diet. I felt this book was presented in a very scientific manner. I used to have regular acid reflux problems. By reading this book I came to understand the implications of that on my overall health, and since reading it over two years ago I have never had indigestion again."
3,You get what you pay for,"When buying this remote control, remember, you get what you pay for.It works, but is sometimes glitchy and gets poor reception even when only 3' away. It's made with some pretty cheap plastic that breaks upon first impact into anything.So if you're looking for a cheap novelty gift, or just a cheap remote control to pass the time, this works good. If you're looking for something that will stand up to a bit of abuse and be a well used remote control, you might want to spend a few dollars more and get something better."
5,Made me laugh!,This book isn't hilarious. It's just plain old good and funny. What a group of characters and a story that had me baffled until the very end and I'm really good at figuring these out! Can't remember when I've had such a fun time with a book. Mr. Doss' asides about what his characters are thinking are often very revealing about human nature and enough to keep you giggling to yourself. Good light reading.
4,Fun Story,"This book was an easy read. I liked the mystery, but there was little build up of suspense. He's not as good as 'early Hillerman', but it falls in line with some of Hillermans more recent work. I think Kirk Mitchell probably does a little better job of building suspense. I do plan to read one of his other books."
2,Not great,"I liked Tony Hillerman's earlier books and thought I'd try something with a similar theme by James D. Doss. The characters here didn't come across as likable as Hillerman's, the atmosphere isn't as good, and this plot seemed kind of fragmented. Several of the key story elements were way outside the bounds of credibility, such as the explanation for the decapitation of one of the victims and his fang like punctures. The very end of the book (after the mystery has been solved) is equally unbelievable. OK to read on a plane."
1,Grandmother Spider,This book was not entertaining. I suffered through each page. I hated the plot and most of the characters. I will never read another Doss book again.
2,The lower 1%,"By lower 1% I refer to the types of fans this video depicts. I personally have been a fan for about 25 years and none of my acquaintences are as geeky and nerdy as those portrayed here. If you are a fan and want to see what the other half does this is and interesting culture study. But for a non-fan you may find the fans portrayed here a little TOO weird. If you want a really clever comedic ""homage"" to Trek try Free Enterprise. It's more of a movie than a documentary like Trekkies and it's loaded with references only true fans will get."
4,Fun.,I have all of the Old Series and Next Generation DVDs. I also have all of the movies. These DVDs and Galaxy Quest complete the set. It's a wonderful look at the effect the show has had on the world.
5,A must have for any Star Trek fan,"I enjoyed these DVDs, I took long enough to finally buy them but Star Trek is something I have been involved with since that first show on television. The cast interviews are worth the cost of the DVDs.Those who haven't always been Star Trek fans will learn a lot about the Phenomenon that is Star Trek. Not only did its creator inspire a believe in better future for mankind, it inspired the people who made that future possible. Our technology today owes a lot to the inspiration that was then science fiction, but is today science fact.You won't be disappointed in my estimation IF you buy them."
4,Very different but fun!,"I am not a Trekk fan mainly because I did not watch much TV when I was a child but I have to say, this documentary is very interesting. it amazed me to see how far a person can go and how much they would sacrifice to have a little or a lot what they believe they love the most, very passionate in a weird way. I loved the dedication and on top had a good laugh..."
4,Funny!,"TREKKIES shows Trekkie fans in all their bizarre weirdness. A hillarious look at some truely strange people. I'd say that some of the Trekkies are sick, but they're just too funny. I guess some people will do ANYTHING to get in the movies. Anyway, I laughed so hard my sides hurt."
4,"An interesting and humorous look at ""trekkies""","This is a look at the world of serious trekkies-wear your uniform to work trekkies-an interesting and funny documentary. I was initially going to give it five stars but after reading some of the other reviews I realize that the movie failed to really capture some of the positive ideas about Star Trek. There was a book written a few years back-Everything I Needed to Know I Learned from Watching Star Trek that did a very clever job of applying Star Trek principles to everyday life. However, this is one of the rare movies you can watch with your family."
4,"The movie is good, but the soundtrack ROCKS","Where can I buy this soundtrack? Jimmie Wood, JJ Holiday and Billy Sullivan are my new jammin' toons... I had to record from the DVD. Where can I see these guys LIVE?"
5,It will change the way you look at Star Trek,"It's like entering a new culture, or learning a new language. If your not familiar with the word of ""trekkies"", which I'm not, this movie is an eye opener. Truley worth seeing."
4,Funny stuff,"I like the original Trek series for the camp value, and the occasionally great scripts in the early shows. The new series never did much for me.That said, I found this hilarious and weirdly touching. Sad that so many millions base their lives around loving an old tv show, but hey, it beats being a puppet of organized religion or the military and hating and killing people you don't know, so wtf.Some hilarious moments here. Get it for any trekkies you know."
2,"Cheap price, cheap quality","This flag is of a very poor quality in every way. The first thing you'll notice when pulling this out of the box is creases in the flag. You'll need to iron the flag if you wish to display it, but because of the thin material, this proves to be a very difficult task. However, the worst part of this product is that it is not even square. It is advertised as being 3 ft. X 5 ft. which is true, but the side opposite the 3 ft. is more like 2.75 ft. If you plan on waving this flag from a pole, it may not be noticeable, but if you plan on hanging this on a wall, I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,measurements of colours unequal,"what a disappointment, this flag is mostly yellow, some red, and a tiny bischen black. unsatisfactory colour widths, quite unequal. an insult to the german reputation of precision."
4,Couldnt wait for it :),"Im rly into Germany, and Germany things.So when i ordered this flag, i was vry excited, itz cheap, yet worth the price if you are looking to hang it inside. Its made of pretty thin material, so if your looking to hang it outside....you hav the wrong flag, its durable enough to hang on a wall inside, but definetly NOT made to withstand the elements of mother nature.I rated it pretty low for the ""toy"" value, since it realy isnt a toy you can play with.Overall, i luv this flag:D"
2,they forgot to use a ruler...,"would be a great value (yes, it's thin, but it's $5!) except the dimensions are noticeably off - width of the gold stripe is a bit more than 12.5"", red is about 12"" & the black stripe is about 11.25"". I bought 3 (they're cheap! they're cheap!) and they're all like this. Just enough to be noticed even with a casual glance. As for me? Come on, I'm a German, of course I notice things like this!"
5,German Pride!!!,Great flag for a great price. Got exactly what I wanted. Would recommend for anyone looking to express cultural pride or just to have a great flag.
4,Looks good!,Looks good on a dorm wall and the perfect college student price. I would not suggest putting it on a flagpole outdoors.
5,Purchased this as a flag to display in my living space and home not a toy.,I am very happy with this flag. I find it to be very durable for this short time I have owned it!
4,German foods on aisle 4!,"I bought this flag for the grocery store that employs me. We have been expanding our international foods to include German wares. The British and Portuguese sections are announced with corresponding flags hung from the ceiling; it is an attractive way for customers to find those sections.The flag did arrive folded up, resulting in a lot of creases, but what would you expect? The cost to ship it flat would be outrageous. The material is quite thin, so I wouldn't recommend this flag for outdoor use. The colors are nice and bright. All in all, a great buy for four bucks!"
5,Great seller,I'm a multiple buyer that is very pleased. FAST shipping and seller was quick to reply to any questions. Will continue to buy my flags from them.
1,Order from someone else.,"For one thing, the flag stripes are vertical instead of the horizontal. The material is fine, and the direction of the stripes doesn't bother me too much. What bothers me is that IT'S NOT THE GERMAN FLAG. I order a 4 dollar flag and the colors are not even in the right order? It's supposed to black on top, then red, then yellow. Instead the black is on bottom, then yellow, then red. Reallllllly? C'mon."
3,Wrong color,Fits very well on my iPhone 4. I dropped it on concrete and it absorbed the fall pretty well. Only complaint is that the black stripe and part of the crest look like a dark navy blue.
2,"Good price, but quality is not the best","I was looking for a simple German flag for a party that I am going to have and thought that this product is perfect for that, especially for that price.The shipping was actually super-fast but the quality of the product is questionable.There are a lot of white spots on the black part of the flag and the 3 stripes are not quiet straight all the way through either.Besides that, for that price the flag's pretty alright."
2,Product seems good; but description isn't,"It seems like a good product and if you are an experienced rider you do not need any additional information to make a decision.However, if you are a new bicyclist you should know1. This goes on the pedals with screws provided with the toe clips. But your pedal should have holes for these screws. Sometimes these holes are covered by a reflector. Please check before buying, or you will need to change the pedal as well .... an additional expense.2. The toe clips are not suggested to be used by childern and kids due to risk of injury.3. These things come in sizes to adjust shoe sizes. You should be fine with a medium for most part, but if you have very big or small shoe size or toe shape, you might want to pay attention to the Toe clip size."
4,Nice Trade Off,"These are a nice trade off between clip-in pedals and bare platforms. Ultimately these did not work for me and I have gone back to clip-in pedals (for now). But these do have a place, especially for a commuter bike where clips can be positively deadly. The bolts fell out on the first ride, probably because I did not install them right? No instructions, so I am just guessing. A lock-nut will easily fix the problem."
2,"doesn't fit, if it did, they'd be great","If it fit, I know it would be a great product...I had a set before on an older bike. My current bike, which is over 10 years old, a Trek 4500, I guess with standard pedals for that model, these toe clips dont fit. They were cheap enough not to send back for the time being, but I doubt I'll buy new pedals just to make them work. My pedals do have holes in them for mounting, but the clip just doesn't line up. Plus no directions. Sure it should be easy enough to screw the things on, but there is an additional metal plate that comes with the clip. Not sure of its purpose. My pedals recess a little where the holes/refectors are. If your pedals are flat/flush, you should be fine and will probably like these. I think they are durable enough, the plastic seems hard. Like I said, I had a pair back in the 90's and they were good."
5,Great alternative!,"These clips are a great alternative to the strapped clips. Easier to get in and out of them. I am a beginner and could not get used to the clipless or the strapped clips. These keep your feet on the pedals, are easier to use and were a great value at amazon.com."
4,Good for mountain-biking,"These are good for what they are made for, which is mountain-biking, or just casual biking. You can't pull up, but your feet stay on the pedals through the bumps. I've had mine for at least 5 years, still like them."
3,OK - Not what I was looking for,"First it would help if they provided some guidance on the different sizes offered (like what shoe size). I had a pair of strapless toe clips for road biking but they were a little too short. I was looking for a larger pair to get my foot place better on the pedal. These are larger (got the L/XL - size 11.5 shoe) but as someone else mentioned all these do is help keep your foot on the pedal. They are not rigid and they are boxy, so if you lift your toe up the you really are not getting much pull up on the pedal.The other pair I had was rigid so they actually helped with the upstroke on the pedaling. Have to keep looking.Been riding for a while with this item - still would prefer they were more rigid - BUT they have worked well so far - little long - scraping on the ground when just pushing the bike versus riding."
4,"Easy, tough, inexp$","I bought these after trying out the longer thinner style toe clips with the adjustabe band. I also bought the delta half toe clips along with these to test them out, and these are better. If your looking for something that will keep your foot in position and doesn't give under hard pressure, this is a best bet before clipless. The fastener interface is bulky whick prevents the washers and screw heads from tearing through the bores, a problem i had seen with most other styles. The mold itslef is also very stiff which i like when pedalling hard on rocky climbs. The Zefals took a few rock hits and didnt crack either."
1,BROKE DURING FIRST USE!!!,"I installed the toe clips and went out for a ride on a walking trail, this was by no means a technical MTB track or anything remotely close to that. About half way through my ride, the right toe clip struck a tree root and snapped right off. The base of the clip was still bolted on to the pedal.These are most certainly NOT durable and long lasting, as the description would have you believe."
5,Perfect for Beginners,"I've used half-toe clips in the past for friends getting into cycling, but scared of toe clips and bindings. They're excellent. This time, I put them on my 7-year old's mountain bike. The half-toes function to keep the rider from sliding off the pedals, allow them to start learning the full pedal stroke and teach the basics of pedal positioning. My son picked it up quickly and loves the secure feel while descending rocky or bumpy trails."
4,NOT for road biking,I wanted to give these things 1 star because they hit the wheels when pedaling and making turns. But then realized the description said Mountain biking so this is just an FYI to whomever is considering this for a road bike - do NOT get this.
3,Look functional,"They seem functional, but are not able to be attached to my son's pedals, as they are solid and don't have the holes that are apparently necessary to attach them to."
2,"Quality construction, weak design","I wanted commuter bike pedals that don't require the use of yet another specialty pair of footwear, so I figured I'd give these a go. The whole point of toe clips is to allow you to pull up on the pedal rather than just push down. These flex so easily that you really can't pull much before your toe pops out. I'd recommend saving your money and avoiding these."
3,Early Ed McBain,"These are short stories by ""The author later known as Ed McBain"". Learned that he was born to Italian/American Parents. (Though he obviously didn't care for that categorization - See Steve Carella's comments from more recent 87th Precinct Novels). The Author.. was born in NYC (believe it was Italian Harlem).IF you are an Ed McBain addict (as I am) then buy this, to get an idea of the author's development. IF you are new to McBain Try a later 87th Precinct Novel. (""Fiddler's"" is quite good.) OR the Matthew Hope Series is Excellent. (""There was a Little Girl"" comes to mind.)"
1,"Quickly thrown together, and not worth the read","The book Warlock Rock came out about the same time the rock band Judas Priest was on trial for allegedly causing a teen to commit suicide.It seems to me that Stasheff took many elements of hysteria and paranoia that the news media played up and attempted to create a storyline around them. The book tries to tie in these references to the overall world-theme Stasheff spent years creating in the Warlock series and fails utterly. One wonders if the publisher wanted to capitalize on the trial for free publicity.I have all the other books in the series and enjoy them. The overall theme of Warlock Rock was actually offensive to me, as if Stasheff were preaching that listening to a certain type of music was wrong. This story doesn't seem to fit in, and does not need to be included in your collection. You can skip this one; it's not worth having."
2,Beware of puns,My least favorite warlock book. Things mentioned in rock music come to life in witch moss. It reminded me of Xanth.
2,Lame. Christians against rock-n-roll music.,Takes one of the dumber planks of the religious right and tries to make a story around it. Some Christians think rock and roll music leads to evil. Apparently Mr. Stasheff is one of these.
2,Avoid this disc,Pascal Roge and Ysaye give fine performances which are unfortunately spoiled by a distracting reverberant acoustic. I would advise those interested in this repertoire to forego this duo in favour of Domus' recordings which are available on two separate Hyperion discs.
3,They Aren't Deep as Described,"One problem with purchasing items online is that you rely on pictures and descriptions without actually seeing the product in person. These escargot dishes are described as having ""6 deep cavities"". I guess their definition of deep varies from mine, because I found them to be too shallow. They are pretty well made and look nice, but I would not have bought them if I knew the actual depth. They are cheaper than what I saw at Sur La Table and Williams Sonoma, but I would have known the actual depth if I bought from those brick and mortar shops.Also, I think they were just fine to clean- not sure what kind of problems some of these other reviewers were experiencing."
2,Don't buy from a picture,"I was looking for escargot baking dishes to make shrimp havarti that I get at our neighborhood bar. What I received was not quite what I was thinking it was. The wells were not very deep, not deep enough for a small shrimp, probably not big enough for escargot either. It was kinda hard to tell by the picture how deep the wells were and the description didn't really say either. I was very disappointed in the product but since I paid half the purchase price in shipping, I was afraid what it would cost to return them. I will never order from this company again....sorry BIA. I should have just bought the same one I bought my kids cause they were the perfect size for what I wanted."
3,"Good, but difficult to clean","These are good, but they are difficult to clean. Great value for the price, though."
1,Following Aslan: A book of Devotions for Children,"I purchased the book for my daughter and her children. They had recently purchased an I-pad and I was with her as she downloaded the kindle to read the book.1. I was truly disappointed to find there are no images, drawings, or pictures in this children's book. I had no way of know this when I purchased it.2. In additon it was not easy to read.A total disappointment! I assumed children's books have images. It was a waste of my money and a waste of time for my very busy daughter."
1,not for my dog,"this is a good product if you want your dog to smell like fresh-squeezed orange juice, but I still saw ticks and fleas, and they were getting worse. This is not something for dogs who get into ponds or creeks or pools a lot. I will go back to using Hartz drops."
1,Doesn't work,This product didn't work; had to go back to the more expensive but effective Frontline Plus
1,Nooooooo !,"I hate giving bad reviews, but I bought for all 3 of my dogs (3 different weights) and it didn't kill ONE flea. They are still crawling all over my dogs 3 weeks later. So Sad."
1,"DEADLY! look it up online this product is harming many, many pets","""Pyrethroid toxicity targets nerve and muscle cells in pets, according to a study published in The Veterinary Journal in June 2008. The study found that dermal exposure by application to the skin or coat is the most common route of toxic exposure, potentially causing hyperexcitability, tremors, profuse salivation, and seizures. The seizures can result in brain damage or, less frequently, death."" (copied from alternet.org)"
1,Not effective,I guess you get what you pay for. I have a 64 pound dog and this treatment had no effect what so ever on the fleas.
2,Has a pleasing smell that's about it!,"This did absolutely nothing the aid in the prevention of fleas/ticks on my puppy. I'll finish batch, however, won't be purchasing product again!!"
5,Have used this for years,"I only had one problem with this product since using it since around 2000. I used it one spring and noticed fleas were still on my golden retriever. I called the 800 no. on the package to check if I had somehow gotten an expired batch and how does one know the expiration date. I was told by the girl that Bio Spot is good for two years after purchase. I told her that didn't make much sense, that means it could have been expired before I purchased it. If it sat on a shelf for over two years, and I purchase it, it's still good for two years? Anyway, I bought another batch and the fleas disappeared in a day or two. Ticks take longer, but the ones I did find on my dog were either dead, dying, or feeling on the puny side."
2,????,"Not so sure about this. It was difficult to put together, and afterwards, it has never worked correctly.Not real happy with this purchase."
3,More than just a curio,"A companion to the Hits collection, Misses gives you 14 songs picked by Joni herself, that she felt missed out on some of the popularity and acclaim she thought they deserved. I picked it up purely out of curiosity. I didn't need Hits, I already had most of those on the original CDs (Court and Spark, Blue, etc.).Misses makes for a nice sampler, leaning a little more heavily on the post-70s Joni. Great music, imagery, and some biting social commentary (it wouldn't be Joni without it!)If you are new to Joni Mitchell, or just want the popular stuff, you might want to pass this one up. But if you have more than a causual interest in her music, it's worth getting.Some of the best are Beat of Black Wings, The Magdeline Laundries, Sex Kills, The Reoccurring Dream.Joni lobbied against putting this one in a jewel case. It says so right in the liner notes."
3,Joni Mitchell - Misses,"This one was a miss for me. For more casual JM fans like me, stick with the Hits collection, or my favorite of her studio albums from 1974, Court and Spark."
5,One of the best.,"On short, this is one of the best cases I have come across for home use. Very well made, and how many cases have a door latch? Athlon approved 300w power supply."
4,Wheel club review,"The wheel club is a great deterant for anyone that would think about trying to move a vehicle or trailer, or whatever. The only drawback is the slider bar. Great design, however, the slider bar is so snug, that installing it and removing it is very awkward. Once the slider receiver had been ""broken in"" and the slider lubricated, it worked relatively easy. That's the only thing I have to say about this club."
2,The Wheel Club,Bought this item to secure a trailer. The design is very good but the materials used are not very good. I felt like a Sawzall would make short work of cutting this off of the wheel. Low price but next time I will spend more money to get a better product.
2,"WINNER INTL Wheel Club Review Chuck Sharin Renton,WA","I selected this product to prevent my car trailer from being stolen/towed away. I'm told that even with locking the hitch, thieves can fasten onto the hitch area via chain and move the trailer.The Club Wheel Immobilizer 1)does not prevent the lugnuts from being removed, as the thieves COULD have another spare ready to install. 2) The metal structure just apears lightweight and easy to defeat. 3) The lock looks easy to defeat. (Unfounded, untested opinions)I selected the product because of its relatively inexpensive cost. In this case maybe you do get what you pay for ???????????I RETURNED the product to AMAZON!!!!!!!!"
2,almost but not quite,"Received the quick coupler today.......found it defective as the stem and nut would not fit. Had to moto=tool to make fit......just my luck would be set a bad one, but was glad I could fix. I think I could have bought a competitors disconnect at a cheaper price and been just as happy."
1,3 Defective items,"I ordered and returned 3 of this item so far. I ordered 1 about 2 months ago which was defective (the airbrush side stem was bent).Yesterday i received 2 more i ordered and they have the exact same defect. Amazon was great about getting me a refund and return shipping label, i only hope they take a look at their stock and make sure that they are not shipping more of the defective item. 3 items in 2 months is a bit more than normal defect rate."
1,trash,"I bought this to allow me to connect either of my air brushes to my compressor, this means i need two of them. But for some reason I only bought 1 just to test it out, and it was trash, does not work, will not connect at all and their is no damage to the coupling from shipping or anything."
1,disappointing,A good example of when a fine cast gets lost in the tedium brought on by stupid plots and teen sex humor. Can't anyone come up with a better idea for a show other than the father wishing he had sex like his teenage sons? What a bore. Very disappointing.
1,BOOOORING,"I love Hugh Laurie in House M.D., so I thought I'll watch this movie. Half way through the first disk I stopped. This movie/mini series did not hold my attention. I never understood why people want to discuss their sex life with their kids and vice versa. Hugh Laurie wasn't funny in this one and I could not identify with any of the characters, just reminded me of several of my Euro friends who are caught up with talking a lot about themselves and their sex life; in my opinion a sign of low self-esteem...and you know what they say about dogs that bark.If you want to watch a great movie with Hugh Laurie, check out ""Peter's friends"", which I discovered way before House M.D. existed.Well, I'm glad I checked this one out from the Library."
2,FortySomethnig,"I have always loved the comedic abilities of both Hugh Laurie & Anna Chancelor. However, as much as I looked forward to this series, I was very disappointed. Both these actors were wasted on a totally. trite and NOT funny series of almost fiasco proportions. By the time I got to the third episode, not only did I not think they were funny, I definitely got the impression they too, knew it!. I would not recommend this to anyone! So Sad! The writers should be ashamed of themselves and have hopefully moved on to more suitable profesions."
4,What you expect is what you get...,"It's a decent movie for what it is... a glimpse of a typical rave with no preachy overtones, or too much of a plot to get in the way. Just be in the right state of mind and it is a good watch.Production, writing, and acting well done to simulate the rave atmosphere where the music takes over and the social rules don't apply anymore. Such as conversation scene on dance floor with Damon, Elena, Mia, and Xander trying to communicate (and not doing so). And the fast talking girl rolling and falling in love is almost as real as it gets, along with the self realization when Nick is sketching out after getting double dosed (and makes the perfect reference to the shakespeare classic).Best indside joke - Xander: ""It gets good milage"", on why he drives a miata"
2,Like the idea... not so much on the execution,"Well, where to begin... I wasnt a fan of any of the actors too much, but I've got to admit I like the idea of Midsummer set at a rave and ecstacy is what Puck is peddling. I needed this movie to compare with the Stanley Tucci version for a class project and I would HIGHLY reccomend the Stanley Tucci version. Its not updated, but sometimes you gotta ask yourself why update Shakespeare? Im not saying im utterly against it, but is it necessary in each case?"
1,Did I really just spend my night watching this?,"I must have been really desperate for mindless entertainment! I agree, there were some pretty good old songs though."
5,Rave on,"Its a movie made for a E head raver techno trance junkie. You will be entertained right until the ending credits. It is ment to be cheesy and make fun of the whole rave scene.I dont know if it was the music but there is really a lovable quality about the film. If the music doesent get you to love it you have plenty of cheesy dialouge and cheesy to the max scenes to keep you entertained. It doesent even come close to being as good as Groove but it does show a more realistic portrayal of the scene and people. All in all if your looking for a well made ""rave movie"" watch Groove, Human Traffic, Party Girl, or Go. But if you liked those how can you not like this?"
3,Mildly Entertaining - Good Music,"There is nothing new or witty about the movie but it is still mildly entertaining. The music however transformed my room into a dance party even though I was watching it alone. Too bad there is no soundtrack to go with the movie. If you want to watch something light and humorous without having to use much brain power, check it out. It was nothing special but I still enjoyed watching it."
3,not the best movie ever.,i got this because i had remembered seeing it a few years ago. it wasn't as good as i remembered though. it is kind of slow and not too exciting. i would only recommend it for young teenagers or people who like to do drugs. it has some famous actors in it but it really isn't a very good movie.
3,Rave,"I'll be honest, I bought this movie only because I read that Charlie Spradling is in it. She's gorgeous. Unfortunately, she is only seen for a few seconds in the deep background. For Charlie Spradling fans a complete disappointment. As for the movie, it's probably OK if you like the teen rave scene, otherwise..."
4,smooth,"I really like this album. I listened to it about 10 days ago here on amazon and thought i'd buy it and i'm pleased I did. I thought it had something and it does! I just can't stop humming one of the tunes. Don't get me wrong Joshs' style isn't entirely unique but he does have his own way of playing, I can often hear influences of Courtney Pine and believe it or not Maceo Parker in the tunes. Many artists tend to stand in convention like they can't possibly move from it but this guy blends his views and aspects of jazz together nicely to create a smooth but tasty dish."
4,"Excellent first track, makes whole CD worth it.","I love this CD, Joshua Redman sends a sound through my speakers that I want to copy. But the only track I absolutely love is #1. Plus on this CD, his music is a little more commercial and a little less in the heart and soul of jazz"
5,More Treasures of the Twilight Zone,"What Twilight Zone fan wouldn't leap upon the opportunity to own three classic Twilight Zone episodes in their original condition with DVD quality? More Treasures of the Twilight Zone surprisingly managed to surpass the first Treasures in quality and extra features. I was overjoyed to see that included before each of the three episodes (The Masks, The Howling Man, Eye of the Beholder) the original teaser for the episode given at the end of the previous week's episode were included. The only disappointment that came from this DVD is the mistake in credits and reviews for the episodes. In this section they (apparently by accident) show the credits and reviews for the three episodes in the first Treasures of the Twilight Zone and include nothing about the three that are actually on the DVD!"
3,Good if not as good as Broadway version,good although lacking the complexity of the Broadway recordings
2,Madonna cannot sing nearly as well as Julie Covington,"I saw the movie and listened to both soundtracks. Take it from me, Julie Covington is MUCH better than Madonna in the title role. While Julie Covington sang strongly and beautifully at the correct octave, they had to make the songs a few octaves lower so Madonna could sing it. I love Julie Covington's lyrical voice with the slight, sophisticated accent. Madonna simply cannot compare. Buy the Broadway version of this instead- it is entitled Evita: An opera based on the life story of Eva Peron 1919-1952."
1,Not nearly good as the Broadway version,This recording pales in comparion to the Broadway version. Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin beat Madonna and Antonio Banderas hands down.
3,It's ok,"It was alright, but the onley songs that I auxley liked were 1-6 and 6-7. But I also love ""Don't cry for Me Argentina."" But me I prefure the Phantom of the Opera,or Joseph and the Amazing Techicolor dreamcoat. I still think that the phantom of the Opera is best, I even found one cd and the "" WallMart"" in Lewistion, and one at ""Big K Mart,"" also in lewistion."
2,Madonna's voice is simply too weak...,...for musical singing. It gets on your nevers after some time and you simply have heard better versions of these songs by better singers often before
1,Not the best version.,"Madonna just can't sing this music, and Banderas just can't sing at all! Get the Broadway album with Lupone and Patinkin-it's good!"
2,Bring Back Patti!,Madonna's weak attempt at repriseing the role that rightfully belongs to Patti Lupone is pitiful. Antonio Bandaras though easy on the eyes can't live up to mandi Patinkin
1,No Talent Madonna,"As usual, You have all these people that think Madonna is great. Not only is the music grotesque, but so is the acting. Broadway music at its worst. Madonna cannot sing or act. Her only talent is how to manipulate young teenyboppers into buying her CD's. Madonna wishes she was Barbara Streiand."
5,Great Book!,This is a wonderful and well thought out book.It takes the guess work out of trying to remember feeding and sleeping times. It also makes a wondeful gift for a baby shower. I would highly recommend My Baby's Log Book!
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I highly recommend tracking your baby's eating and sleep schedule and this book definitely provides you the outline to do so but the pages you have to write on are not easy to write on. This book needs to be sprial bound. Whenever I got to the end of the week I couldn't get to the area I needed to write on b/c it was part of the book binding. Plus the columns they give you to write on are very narrow. If you want to write down a note or two, forget about it. You are better off creating a spreadsheet to track your babies eating and sleep schedule and putting in a 3 hole binder. I wish I had."
3,Good,"The log book has all the space you need for all of your feedings, sleep times, and diaper changes. The only thing I would change is that the sleep time is in the back of the book. I would rather have it on the same page as the rest of the events for that day, instead of trying to go to another page to put in another bit of information, several times a day."
5,THANK YOU JOY,This book is the best. I have read it a few years ago and it gave me the courage to write my book.THANK YOU JOY
3,Bravo to a rather good writer.,"This is my first Temple novel. Temple is admittedly a very good writer. If you are looking for a new author and a good new series this is the one to see. But, in this novel I fail to see the connection between cornbread and a murderer's need to kill. Then there is the fact that Heaven has had five husbands --- only one of whom is dead. Then there is the reason for her loosing her license to practice law. What a shame."
4,Good Beach Book,"This is the second book that I have read in the Heaven Lee series. The characters are very quirky, and the setting of a Historic District Dedication in Kansas City, leaves all sorts of possibities for mayhem. These are all fulfilled, plus a few that I didn't think about."
2,Not Jill Mansell's best,"Having just finished Nadia Knows Best, my first Jill Mansell book, I was desperate to read another of her novels, expecting to love it as much as the first. I was very disappointed. This book is very predictable and unbelievably sappy and cheezy. The main character is so unrealistically ""perfect"" that I hated her and found myself cheering when anything bad happened to her. The other characters are no less hateful and sleazy. If you choose to read a Jill Mansell novel, I highly recommend avoiding Fast Friends."
3,Good for a basic overview and not much more...,"This small book is good for a quick overview of the the Russian Revolution and Lenin's life. It explains the basic ideas pretty well and has the important facts laid out in an interesting and easy to understand way.Still, this book is biased towards Lenin's cause, and justifies to too great an extent Lenin's killing of hundreds of thousands of people in the Red Terror.If you need a quick study guide on the Russian Revolution, this book is fine - just keep in mind that Lenin was not really as benevolent a person as he is made out to be in the cartoons. But, if you are trying to really understand the topic or write a serious research paper on it, save your money and buy another book on Lenin, such as ""Lenin"" by Robert Service."
2,Couldn't get my cat to take it.,I purchased this gel because I have one cat who gets urinary crystals and his grain free food doesn't contain Methionine which is recommended to help acidify the urine and prevent blockage. Unfortunately this gel has a horrible scent and I could not get my cat to consume any of it. If I mixed it in his food he wouldn't touch it and force feeding him with a syringe was not successful and was super stressful for both of us and stress is a big no-no for kitties who are prone to blockage. I really wish this product was palatable because I would much rather supplement his high quality grain-free diet than have him on the prescription stuff from the vet that makes him gain weight like crazy.
4,Different and Clever,"Unsentimental and strange inside familiar settings. Sometimes the grimness is a bit forced, but overall it's well justified within the story, which is good.Monument is interesting, moves fast and is worth reading, especially if you're steeped in the trite tropes of most fantasy novels. Ian Graham is the Graham Greene of fantasy literature, but you might not want to make a steady diet of his work. (I hope he writes more, though.) A load of weary cynicism and nihilism could end up as forced and as false as pablum, I think. Even so, Graham's outlook is a breath of fresh air.For the gamers out there, this is very much what your D&D world would actually be like. Fun, huh?"
4,Suspend disbelief,"Not being one normally drawn to fantasy, this one appealed to me mainly because of the fact that is was atypical. Graham does an admirable job in creating his world, and I found his characterization and desciptive powers noteworthy. Ballas is totally despicable, which is exactly the point. The church is nearly as hateful, ruling with an iron fist in their stormtrooper fashion. If you can get past the outrageous odds of Ballas surviving one attack after another, (this is fantasy after all) I think you will find this book to be well worth your time. I look for more from Graham in the future."
1,YAWN..........,"First I have to admit, I only read 150 pages of this book. That was all I could possibly stand. Life is just too short to waste on a book you don't enjoy reading.Ballas, our main character, is a drunk and a scoundrel. One is not sure whether they should root for or against him. He is a vagrant, thief, and all around not so nice guy. He steals a mysteriously beautiful gemstone, which sets into motion something........I got too bored to stick around and find out what.The first 150 pages are filled with Ballas being beaten within an inch of his life, coming to, healing enough to move on, only to be beaten within an inch of his life again. ok, we get it, let's get on with the story. I just got too bored to stay with this one folks. Maybe it got better, but to me, if an author can't write well enough to grab and maintain my attention, their book isn't worth my time. There are too many great books out there. Read this one at your own risk, if you can stay awake through it, that is."
5,Bryan Cranston is awesome,Everything good about the packaging and the quality of the image and wow the sound is amazing with the explosions
5,Breaking Bad,Excellent show!!!! Too bad the writer's strike cut the season short. Will definitely be getting Season 2.
5,This really delivers!,"I enjoyed the video and all of the action. It's so refreshing to see a teacher ""Break Bad"". They get few opportunities to do this in real life."
5,One of the best shows on TV!,Great show!!! Watching it on Amazon Video on Demand was very easy and very good quality. Very good service for renting or buying movies.
5,Wow,"Straight up one of the best, most creative, fierce, funny and outright insane shows I've ever seen. Literally from the first scene of the series (those who have seen it know what's up) this hits the ground at a frantic pace and never lets up. It is so wrong on so many levels, its a testament to great writing, acting and directing that despite how wrong it is you end up cheering for the main character pretty much from the jump and continue to do so atrocity after atrocity. TRIPPY. Lots of grey areas to explore in this series, and they do it very well. Don't expect anything to be straight forward, everything is subject to twists, and often brilliant ones. I really wish I could go into more detail but this is the kind of show you really don't want even the slightest hint of spoilers for. It deserves a 5 though, big time. BIG time. Cranston has become one of my favorite actors with this. Who knew Malcom's dad had such ferocity in him?"
5,Incredible,"Breaking Bad season one, in only seven episodes, shows what a great television show can be. But it's not just great,it's superior to anything I have ever seen on TV and is probably better than 90-95% of any movies that come out in a given year, no exaggeration. Before I even saw the last episode I ordered season 2 hahaha. A great buy, really."
5,HOLY COW !!!!! (N.A. IN WI),MY BROTHER FROM OKLAHOMA INSISTED THAT I WATCH BREAKING BAD FROM THE START - I NEVER REALLY HAD TIME - BUT I EVENTUALLY DID TRY THIS ON MY KINDLE FIRE - I WAS HOOKED!! ANYBODY WHO WANTS A LITTLE COMEDY - SUSPENSE - AND CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THE NEXT EPISODE TYPE SHOULD GIVE THESE EPISODES A TRY - YOU WILL LOVE THEM! SOMETIMES...YOU JUST NEED TO LISTEN TO YOUR BIG BROTHER...
5,Product as described,I received the product in a timely fashion and the product was as described. I got a great deal and look forward to receiving the other seasons on Bluray as well.
1,what is this?,"AMC's - what is this? is a no sense or no nothing show ? this is fun? i don't understand , people do you like this? no more words."
1,Not region free anymore,"Bummer to find out that this was an (new?) edition only for region A. Uploaded customer picture of region free edition is not what I got. Even www.blu-raystats.com is wrong, so how to find out what kind of product you're buying? Disc went straight to the plastic recycle bin, to much hassle to bother to return. No more US blu rays from amazon.com for me."
1,Flawed DVD,This dvd arrived in a timely fashion which I gave as a Christmas gift. When tried to watch the DVD it had the sound from the directors review dubbed onto the pilot of the series so we were not able to watch the pilot which made the rest of the series harder to get. Stated was watched once but doubt that since it was damaged.
3,Character Development,"We have heard rave reviews about this series so we are watching them all. The first season can be summed up as Character Development. At times it is very slow and if I had seen this program when it was originally out I probably would have not watched it. Due to the hype, we kept watching. The second season is much better and has us hooked.The service from Amazon is excellent and am thrilled we have it."
3,NO English Subtitles???,"The potential market for English subtitles is in the millions. That includes the hard of hearing but also people who know some English, but not well, who need to follow the subtitles to understand.That this show has foreign subs and not English seems strange!"
3,Breaking Bad,The 11 mins I saw was funny and looks to be a good show to watch. I think I will download and watch 1st season.
4,Great show with weaknesses.,"For the most part, I agree with the glowing tones of most of the users, but I'll just spend this review elaborating and disagreeing.I thought the first 5 episodes were just fantastic. Especially the way they took what you'd think would become a 1 dimensional character and filled them out. There is a character named Hank who at the beginning looks like a stupid racist cop, but in reality has a good heart and is awkward sometimes and just frankly surprises you. Many characters like that. I love the sense of, 'huh, haven't seen that before' that I get from this TV show.However, i think it gets a bit weak right at episode 6. Maybe it's writer's strike stuff in here, but there's a bit too much badassery (visiting Tuco) and, umm, I don't know, CSI like explanations of chemistry stuff...Caused me real concern in the direction of the show, but I'm definitely going to continue on to season 2..."
4,Gray Matter,"this episode is a good one, Jesse tries to get a job since his partner don't want to continue making money off drugs. Walt and his wife goes to a old friend birthday party. Jesse meet his old friend after a bad job interview. They hook up to make crystal meth but it goes wrong when Jesse tries to make it perfect like his old partner, meanwhile Welt is offer a jod by his old only because the friend was told Walt was dying by his wife. Later on in the show Jesse & Walt are back at it."
2,"Dark, Depressing, and Generally Uncomfortable","Our search for a show to help us kill a few hours each week led us to try Breaking Bad based on reviews we had heard. After watching the first season, we will not be ordering the second.Overall the acting is good, and other technical pieces are well done. However, the plot line is very dark, and the characters seem to be steadily engaging in a series of bad decisions moving to worse decisions.The show deals with terminable cancer, drug culture, healthcare woes for the middle class, and portrays even the 'good guys' in a negative light. The themes the show uses are discordant with my value system, so the show is not enjoyable.I can see why the show is so critically acclaimed, and the use of suspense is effective. At the end of the season though, I don't feel motivated to continue."
4,Breaking Bad Season One,"Awesome show with a lot of very light and funny moments mixed in with dark and frightening moments. Many twists and turns as you watch the lead character Walt, concerned family man morph into an almost psychopathic meth dealer. There are a couple of holes in the writing which make you draw your own conclusions, but I think that is from the budget of AMC and the limit on amount of shows. This would be Soprano-esque had HBO picked it up to develop. Well worth the price!!!"
5,Bryan Cranston better get an award for this one!,"This is one of the first series that has kept me waiting for next week in years. I was captivated by the understated tension Bryan is able to show so realistically. Good people are forced underground by devastating illness and of course medical expenses in this country, all the time. This forces you to look at it. Illegal substance production/abuse is never a black or white issue at the core, even though it's never the ""right"" choice, this shows us what happens when it seems like the ""only"" choice.Keep up the good work!!"
4,I'm curious,Season 1 has gotten me curious. I wouldn't say I'm hooked but I am curious to see where this show goes. On to season 2...
5,Love breaking bad!!!,"Amazing show!!! Amazing acting, outstanding cast! My ONLY problem with the show is walts wife, and sister in law, I just dot not like these characters. They are the only characters with bad acting. So worth the money!!! Buy every season!!!!"
5,Addictive.,"Hard to stop watching. The first episode got us all hooked. We have to practice a lot of self control, so we have something to look forward to the next marathon."
5,Great show!,Got hooked on this show in the first season. Very entertaining and great acting and plot twists.
5,Excellent series.,This is an excellent series. I don't know what turned me off when it first came out. I think it was the title.The dvd does not support closed captioning in English.
2,"I like the show, but dislike the amazon player.","Flash was a bad technology when it was being supported. It's even worse now, on top of being obsolete. It doesn't work correctly (when it works at all), it crashes, the audio often gets out of sync (especially if you try to rewind or fast forward), it runs all of my processors so hard that the fans come on and ruin the viewing experience. It's just terrible in every way. I am running the latest version of Adobe's flash player (all of my software is always up to date).The show is really good. I'd give it 4 stars (and that's a lot considering the general quality of television these days) if watching it weren't ruined by Flash player. I'll be watching the rest of the series on netflix."
4,Great series,"Excellent first season, definitely hooks you. My only comment is that it doesn't have spanish subtitles and I bought it to see with my girlfriend in Mexico, so for this I give it 4 and not 5 stars."
3,"The series is good, but...","I ordered all 4 seasons here for my husband for Christmas. To our dismay, there are no English subtitles! I wish there was more information provided before ordering things like this. Other than that, the CD's are new, all in wrappers, and the series is really good."
5,Hits home,One of the best mini series made of all time.... This show result his home and it isn't made up in a cops tongue. Someone with true hands on experience.
3,LOL I Love this movie but I watch it for free LOL,I just bought a one time subscription so I can just watch all the movies I can think of many people I told like it check it out[...]
3,Haveta Disagree Some,"Three stars for Cranston's solid acting. But geeze. Teacher with a wife, son with medical problems, and baby on the way...doesn't have life insurance? Learns he has cancer and thinks, well, I'll just sell meth. Hm. I don't see the psychological or economic basis. And that absence lingers throughout. The first season leads to that dreadful scene in the drug merchant's lair...with lots of bad acting and that ridiculous explosion. This is stuff for adolescent boys of a certain ilk. But Cranston is terrific."
5,Great Show,"I am absolutely in love with this show! This is clever and witty, and I can not wait for the new season!"
5,Simply awesome,"I had never seen this show on TV before I got the season on DVD so I wasn't really sure what to expect. It turned out to be one of the most original and well put together shows I have ever seen. Normally when I watch movies I play on the computer and whatnot but this show captivated me to the point that I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. The writing is excellent, the characters are well developed even in the first season, and the plot takes so many hilarious, morbid and terribly bizarre (yet believable) turns that you can't help but be completely absorbed."
5,great show,best show ever. good viewing for men and women.well worth the purchase price.start at the beginning. each season gets better.
4,An Excellent Series...,"...however interestingly, I left off for a couple of seasons, came back, and it was as though the series picked right up where it left off. That is the core, the teacher 'Breaking Bad', the slow, easy migration into his new self, living a life he never intended. That which I missed was easily made up for by quickly adapting to their latest endeavors, and projecting what must have happened (which is not earth-shattering) while I took a break.I never got used to his partner in crime, something just doesn't work for me there. But the series has enough depth and subplots so that to some extent he's tolerable."
5,Addicted to this show...,"This season was highly recommended by a friend. Purchased season 1 through amazon.com, watched all episodes back to back. Immediately following, we purchased season 2 & 3 over amazon.com instant play and my husband and I watched 20 episodes back to back over the weekend... we literally couldn't STOP! Exceptional drama; gripping, intelligent,highly suspenseful and addicting to watch! So many, ""HOLY COW - did that really just happen??"" moments. We are astonished that we have never heard about this series before. Highly recommended."
5,Watched all the episodes in one weekend,My son turned me onto this series..once I started watching it I could not get enough. I bought all the previous season episodes too.
5,Breaking Bad season 1,"This was a wonderful play upon the mouse that roared. The main character changed from the meek to the bad ass creator of a whole new business to earn a large some of money. The cast of characters in the show are great, waiting for number three to come out."
1,Australians (and other regions) beware,"Though this product states that it plays in all regions, it does not. Play it in an Australian bluray player, and it will tell you that there is a regional mismatch. I repeat: THIS DOES NOT WORK IN AUSTRALIA. I have played it in multiple Australian bluray players and the same 'region mismatch, see box for details' message comes up each time."
3,Perhaps too good?,"I was really impressed with everything about this show. However, there is way too much dramatic tension for my taste, and I don't consider myself a drama lightweight. After watching the second and third episode yesterday, I couldn't sleep last night. I kept getting woken up by flash-backs.This definitely needs an R rating! I sure wouldn't want kids seeing this."
