2,Not built to last,"Work great, but as others have noted, the cord gets worn through in a few months of use. The rubber wire covering is too soft and tacky; it mashes and disintegrates with regular use at the gym."
3,Too Bad,This headphones were great- but after only having them for a few months the tubing began to disintegrate-- I want to buy them again but customer service is teribble -- and I dont know if I should buy the same product again.
2,"Poor Sound Quality, OK fit/comfort","I bought these to replace the earbuds that came with my iPod. The sound quality was rather poor. I ended up buying Koss PortaSound 2's instead which sound much better. I'm still looking for the good sound quality, comfortable, yet somewhat affordable earphones that are better for excercising, etc."
2,"Sound great, but not for long","I can't recommend these, even though they sound fantastic. I just dumped my second pair of them in 18 months. The first pair almost fell apart after 5 months of almost daily use, then after another few weeks the left bud is barely audible. I thought it might just be bad luck so I bought another pair (the price is certainly right compared to the Shures), but those have gone the same way -- first the insulation separates and then the left bud dies. So after $80 on these I'm back where I started and I think I'm going to spring for the Shures.Sony would have a great product here if they could figure out the build quality."
3,"OK, but expect fraying wires","When I first got these headphones, I thought they were great, and I immediately ordered a second pair for my husband. We've been using them now for about 9 months, and I still love some things about them: they stay in your ears, even when running (even though I have very small ears that often make normal earbuds uncomfortable), and the sound is better than average.However, both our headphones have major wire fraying. Basically, the plastic casing splits really easily, leaving us to constantly patch the cords with electrical tape. Mine now have tape over 80% of the cords. The good news is that the headphones continue to work even when frayed, although one side of my husband's headphones finally gave out last week.Basically, unless you are the kind of person who takes exceptional care of your headphones, winds them up gently nearly all the time and doesn't run with them or use them in other active ways, I'd recommend other headphones."
4,Pretty Good,I bought these as a lightweight alternative to my MDR-CD60's for when I am doing things outside. They do a great job of blocking out noise and the sound quality is good. I have barely used my other headphones since I bought these. These are easily the most comfortable earbuds I have ever worn. They are very lightweight and the earpieces are very flexible. The cord is about 4' long and very lightweight and flexible as well. This isn't always a good thing because the cord becomes tangled and caught on things very easily. I would definitely recommend using something to keep the excess cable wound up and out of the way when you're using these. Otherwise they're a really nice product that I would definitely recommend.
4,They don't hurt my ears!,"I got them right before a long plane ride -8hours- and used them throughout the trip. My ears did not hurt as they usually do with headphones that are not inserted inside the ear channel. They are absolutely comfortable to wear. Plus, they insulate well, as noise is always an issue on plane rides.As for the problems with the cable, time will show."
4,Really good for the price,"This is my second pair (caught the first one in a zipper and stripped the wire) and am very happy with them.Blocks out most airplane noise - does not cancel it, but effective none the less. Comfortable enough for me to wear on a non-stop, 14 hr. flight from NY to Tokyo on multiple trips.Only complaint is that they carry the noise through the cord. What I mean by this is if you bang the cord while they are in your ears you hear a banging noise, so they are really are not feasible for running."
3,Sounds Great but...,"For the price, the EX51's are a great pair of earphones. One day though, I noticed that the rubber wiring that lays on you neck was, for lack of a better word, disintegrating and the copper underneath was exposed. The EX51's still sound great, just found it weird that this happened."
5,These now have a stronger cable.,"I've had a pair of these for well over a year now, and as shown in the customer images above, they had a very flimsy rubber covering over the wires which developed tears and holes easily. Last week, the rubber on mine finally split all the way around the wires, and a few days later, they stopped working on one side.Despite that, I ordered another pair since they do sound great, and other than that flaw, the cable is nice in terms of weight and length. They are also cheap enough now that I wouldn't mind so much if they failed after another year's use.Anyway, I'm writing this to point out these new ones I just received, while otherwise identical, NOW HAVE A TOUGHER RUBBER COVERING OVER THE WIRES than my old pair.For the price, these can't be beat."
4,"MUCH better than the Apple in ears - ok, not great sound","I bought these after giving up on the fit of the Apple in-ears which would not stay in my ears - these fit great, with a much simpler, more flexible design for different ear sizes. The audio quality isn't quite as good as the Apples, but its better than the included ipod earbuds, or typical sony earbuds. The bass is much deeper. The highs are a LITTLE high with these headphones, but its acceptable, and a nice upgrade from the earbud quality I've been used to. Would have liked to give them 3.5 stars."
2,"Great Sound, Short Life","The sound and feel of these buds is phenomenal. I will never again use the cheapie ear-bud imitators. However, the pair I purchased for around $40 had a fatal flaw - durability. After only a few months, the cords near the earpieces basically disintegrated on both sides. I repaired with electrical tape for a functional, but ugly, pair. However, only about a month later, the left side sound died completely.Sony may have a warranty to cover this, but it's just too much of a hassle at that point it this is to occur frequently - and from the other reviews here, that appears to be the case."
2,"Were great, but then they died. I've moved on...","These headphones converted me to the in-ear style. I'm convinced that I can never go back to anything else.However, these headphones died on me after only 9 months. The left channel went out completely. Seems to be a common problem with this unit. Add to that the 90 day warranty and that makes this a one-time-only purchase.I moved on to better things, namely the Shure E2c-n Sound Isolating Earphones. A bit pricier, but they sound better and don't feel as delicate.Sorry Sony, make them a little more durable and they'd be well worth the price."
3,Wire plastic disintegrates over time,"The sound is great for an under $50 earbud. The cord/wire has two length options. One is too short for anything but an arm band attached player. The second option is too long and you have to roll the cord up about 8 inches to make it useful and not constantly getting in the way. NOW FOR THE REAL ISSUE: Although I have enjoyed these earbuds for the most part, the soft plastic wire coverings near the buds disintegrate over time. Once they start absorbing oils from the skin they start to deteriorate - average lifespan is about 5 months before noticable damage. Eventually the wires become exposed and unless you find a creative solution to cover them back up, the buds will stop finctioning. If Sony would fix this problem they's have a fantastic product here."
2,Watch out; no replacements for earbud cushions,"Great earphones. However, the silicon earbud cushions when they are lost or wear out cannot be replaced, and you have to toss the headphones. Also, mine at least fall off easily. Makes them good for a few months of regular use, then dispose. A bit pricey for limited lifetime use. If it came with more replacement earbud cushions would be five star product."
4,"Good sound, very comfortable, pricey.","I use these during daily 1 h bicycle rides with a HD-based mp3 player. Their major benefit, in my opinion, is that they are very secure in your ear and offer good, but not too good, isolation. You can still hear what is going on around you very well. Their sound quality is good, but really not much better than far less expensive in-ear headphones. They are nowhere near as good as conventional over-the-ear headphones of similar price in terms of sound quality. You can only do so much with tiny drivers. The case they come with is cheap and inadequate. Basically all it does is keep the silicone rubber seals on the ear-buds themselves. It should allow wire storage, as well. Finally, at $30, they are over-priced by about half. $15 would be a fair price. If you don't need the secure in-ear feature, you can do as well for much less."
2,Not Worth It for the Price,"I have to admit, for a tiny pair of ear buds, they have a lot of bass. Tons of bass. But when you listen to something with a lot highs, they can't handle it. Sony makes a pair of ear buds for $10 that are better than these. You can probably buy them anywhere. After returning these ear buds, I went with Sennheiser PX-100. They sound great."
1,"Good audio,but wires fall apart.","After 8 months, the wire rubber insulation is peeling off in small brittle chunks, making the earbuds trash. Very bad for decent sounding earbuds. Sony has a warranty exchange program. They will send you used earbuds for $24.30 plus tax after you pay to ship the defective ones back to them."
3,fantastic sound but.......The wire....,"My search for good earphones led me to these babies and I remember the day when I first tried them--they were amazing,they really isolated you and no noise pollution for your neighbours on the bus,metro,etc to contend with.But after 3 months,I kid you not,The cable began to disintegrate but I taped them up...now 6 months on there is virtually no cable left,its all tape and it sticks to my hair.Also I became a little tired of being so isolated,So I had to buy a new pair.I opted for the Sennheiser PX100 Headphones,which are so different but I have to say they have a more natural,richer sound and I feel more ""connected"" with the reality.They are two very different headphones-Sound is excellant although different in both but the sony cable issue really annoyed me.I would give 5 stars for sound and zippo for the wire.Hope this was helpful,John."
1,don't do it,"These worked great...for less than 2 months.I used these at work everyday with my ipod, and one of the earbuds just decided to stop working. Save your money and just get a good quality set of earbuds.I think I would have been very satisfied had it kept working. It blocks out sound very well and sounds decent."
2,Great if you like exposed wires,"I bought these earphones 10 months ago and loved them until this week. The sound quality is great, and they're very comfortable, but they WILL disintegrate. The rubber on the cord has come off in two places, leaving the wires completely exposed.My right earbud has also begun to periodically stop working. Sometimes it's fine, and other times I don't get any sound at all. It's clearly dying a slow death and I expect it to stop working entirely eventually.For the price, you probably won't find a better sounding pair of earphones. If you're looking for a pair that will actually hold up, however, look elsewhere. I've got to buy a replacement pair of earbuds now to replace my broken Fontopias, and I definitely won't be buying these again."
2,Poor Quality Cables - Disgusted with the quality,"These headphones are great for sound quality and convenience. I use these under my ear muffs when shooting which I can't do with the iPod headphones.The shorter left cable is annoying as others have stated.I am on my second set of headphones. With the first set, it took less than a month of daily use for the left cable to melt from my skin oil exposing the wires. After getting them replaced, it has taken me a month again to expose the wires on the left ear bud cable. I am sure I am not the only one with this problem. After 2 weeks, I noticed the cables feel sticky and after a month, the housing has melted and ripped exposing the cable."
2,"New model is terrible, Old ones were Great",The new material the cord is made from is terrible and literally turns to mush - mine survived about 3 months.The old models were great everyday headphones with decent sound and a good design. Do yourself a favor and read the full story in the August 10 review by Tavi down below.For now i'd avoid these unless you can be sure you're getting the old model.
2,Good for a little while,"I bought these headphones and LOVED them - until the plastic started coming off the wires in multiple places. First under the left earbud. I taped it and they worked for a while longer - although they did look a bit silly being held together with tape. Then the plastic came off the wire by the jack and it was all over - there's no more sound in the right earbud.I was considering buying them again because they were so good while they lasted, I thought I might just be too hard on my headphones. Then I saw all the other reviews with the same problem and decided against it."
3,Not Long-Lasting,"I bought these headphones 4 months ago and if I had written a review then, it would have been glowing. I loved these headphones - for the price, the sound and quality was great. I did what others here suggested and kept them in an Altoids gum tin rather than use the case that came with it. I treated these headphones very gently and mainly used them at work while sitting at my desk - I was not hard on these headphones at all. But now, a little over 4 months has passed and the left earpiece has gone out making them pretty much useless. I debated buying another set, but at this rate I will be buying three sets a year and if I am going to spend that kind of money, I might as well buy Shure...which is what I am going to do."
3,"Great sound, but not for long!","I am on my third set of these ear buds. The sound is outstanding at first and they are extremely comfortable. This is why I bought these three times! I was hoping for better luck with an initially excellent product, however, the downside has been that the sound quality in one or both of the speakers starts to fade after about two months of very gentle use. Now, six months after purchase, the left speaker is dead as a doornail after several months of slow deterioration. The right one still sounds like a champ, though, although not as good as when I first purchased it. Sadly, this has been the case for each of the three purchases. There will not be a fourth. I would love these if they just made them to last."
1,"Sound = Great; Cord, Not So Much",Listen to the other reviewers - the cord falls apart within a few months.
2,"ok sound, mediocre design","- very easy to lose the silicone erbuds and once you do, you are out of luck- one wire to one ear is much too short.- wire often gets stuck on the back of my neck, pulling the earbud out of my ear.OK sound but not for $30 - my 15 dollar phones sound just as good."
2,"horrible quality cord, great sound and comfort","When I got these headphones I loved them, they sound perfect, are comfortable, and look good, I expected superior quality which is why I get Sony stuff. I used them for about 6-8hrs aday and within a week the soft rubber cord casing began to rip behind my neck. I've had them for about 4 months, and they are damaged in 5-6 long areas which I covered with electric tape. The rubber ear plug parts fall off easily and I am down to my last pair(of 3 supplied pairs). They still sound great, although they look horrible and are stiff with all the electric tape. Why this rubber cord casing was used I don't understand and am dissapointed every single morning."
1,Sound & comfort great; cable disintegrates,"I loved these when I got them. Then, after a couple of months, I lost them. I was delighted to find them a few days ago--they were in the back of a drawer. When I tried to use them, though, I realized that the cable coating had disintegrated in one place on the extension cable, and it was unusable. The ear bud cable is way too short for use with my iPod. I can use them with my shuffle, but I wonder how much longer the cable will hold up. Obviously, the problem with the cable was not from wear. There is an inherent defect."
5,They fit!,These are the only headphones that actually fit inside my ears and don't fall out. Since they have three sizes of ear phone covers I can pick which ones fit best. I really love these headphones.
2,Bad coloration,"These earphones do weird things at 4kHz and above. No amount of EQ-ing seems to fix it. Get some Sennheiser CX300s, 400s, or 500s instead. As someone who has spent the past 10 years working with audio gear, trust me on this one. This is not brand favoritism, as I have other Sony headphones that I like (check out my headphones list). These are just bad."
5,"Amazing sound, but..","I got these earphones for my 60 gig iPod Video and let me tell you the sound is AMAZING. I own sound-cancelling Sony headphones that cost me $100 and these sound exactly alike, with the advantage of costing $70 less. They get a little uncomfortable though because of the pressure it applies to your ears, but I'm already getting used to it so its not a big problem. Overall, excellent sound, great quality, portable, and great price."
1,phones died immediately after arrival,"It took less than an hour of listening before the left headphone stopped working. For the very brief time that they did work, sound quality was better than stock ipod headphones, but still not as good as I was expecting. Look elsewhere!"
3,A weird Headphone Cable,"They sound great for the price. Fit well. But a strange design in the cable that separates to each ear bud is configured awkward. I also have a friend that has a pair and has the same issue. It is made so you can wrap the right ear bud around your neck in the back but does not wear nicely and lie flat. I love the sound and quality, but do not like this feature that can't be adjusted. I don't recommend this particular version. Dr. Ted Mcleary"
3,Rubber cord start to tear after 2 months.,I really really like this earphones and I use it every day. It really block off any outside noise and easy to move around with. But they don't last that long since the rubber are rather thin. I got them last December and now my left side cord start to tear. If you plan to change it every 2 - 3 month buy this.
2,poor quality,"Sound quality is poor and not crisp.Spend a little more and invest in a better pair.Uncharacteristic of sony to make such bad headphones.Only perk, is very comfortable to wear."
3,Value for Money,I would give it 3 stars.I bought it because of the Sony name and I was not disappointed. FOr the price [along with a 5$ off on that day] it was a good bargain.I use it with my MP3 player and it is much better than the standard ones that come with those.
2,What a waste of money ...,"I'm not a person who complains about much, but these are a serious disappointment. They have very little sound and less bass. The original cheapy earbuds that came with my MP3 player are MUCH better sounding than these things.After all the good reviews I was expecting to be quite pleased. I tried all three differenct sizes and got them to fit properly. That is a nice option having choices. But even the best fitting arrangement is not up to snuff. Back in the package these go. What a waste."
3,"good sound, mine broke quickly","The good:The sound on these is great for the price, as everyone else has said. The length of the cord is wonderful, as is the little earbud case/cord-keeper. There are also 3 sizes of rubber ear-pieces.The bad:I bought mine in June (less than 4 months ago) and the right headphone has stopped working. Looks like I'm not the only one who has had this problem. The rubber ear-pieces pop off pretty easily, so be careful not to lose them (they're about $5 *each*)."
2,Fundamentally flawed,"The ""closed-type"" design may eliminate outside noise but amplifies ""internal"" noise like chewing, walking, speaking, breathing etc. This is unacceptable for headphones meant to be mobile. They only sound decent tucked fully inside the ear canal so they aren't as forgiving as more open type designs. I'm very disappointed in these headphones."
3,So-So for the iPod Mini,"Compared to the stock iPod mini earphones, these offer some improvements. Outside noise is reduced by its closed-type design and the 3 different earsize caps should fit most people pretty well. Sound quality is alright. Very crisp, but the bass is a little bit lacking. But it's on par if not better than the stock earphones. The cord, however, is insane. After the split, the code to the right ear is about 1 foot longer than the left ear. I have no idea why they did this except to make you look like a fool with extra cord hanging around the neck. Additionally, because of the uneven length, there's always a slightly heavier tug on the left ear."
2,$39.99 for comfort?,"I bought these and it sucks!!! The only thing that is good about this is the comfort and can block outside sound. (3 different sizes....wow....(sarcastic)) You cannot share headphones because this is the type that goes behind you. If you have a lot of earwax....it will catch it!!! Yuck!!! The bass is okay, but not as loud than the other ones. The case that came with it was small and I dont know how to use it. The Sony MDRE828LP is alot better. It has the same amount of bass, louder sound, and the wind up case is well worth it. Oh yeah....its 3x smaller in $."
1,Sony MDR-EX51LP ear buds,"Don't bother to order these ear buds. They're horrible. They sound ""tinny"" and don't reproduce bass well at all. Compared to more expensive ear buds they may be OK but I wouldn't recommend you purchase them just because they're Sony. You'd be throwing away your $20."
4,"Sound/fit great, but ""stethoscope effect""","Ok, the fit is amazing. Soft, comfortable. I could wear these things for a long time. I though they might block a little more outside sound than they do --it's not like wearing earplugs-- but they do block about 50% of outside noise I'd say.The sound is really rich and nice compared to the original earbuds I got with my iPod. There is one annoying problem, though. If I'm playing soft music, or anything gentle or low, I notice something. The movement of the cords make a low movement sound; even just turning your head. I've heard someone describe it as a ""stethoscope effect."" Whatever it is, I sometimes find it really annoying. Other times I don't even notice it. My iPod earbuds don't do this. If this problem wasn't there, I think these earbuds would be just about perfect."
1,Don't waste your money - faulty wire,Pro: Sound great.Con: Don't expect to use them for more than 3-4 months... the material used to cover the wire is flimsy and *will* disintegrate if exposed to the sun or if not super careful.I just got off the phone with Sony ... wire issues are *not* covered by warranty. The cost to replace is $26.12 from Sony Repair for what is considered out of warranty damage.
1,Caution!!!,"I bought a pair of these headphones back in April. I use them on a normal day to day basis and when I got them, I made sure to be careful with them, since I went through a couple this year already.I use them with an iPod 4th Generation.Pros: Sounds good for the price. The bass is distinct ( I play a lot of House, R&B;, Club, etc).Cons: After a month the material coating the wires started tearing. I'm not the only one experiencing this problem either, based on reading other customer reviews. It's made of some cheap rubbery material. Not worth the money at all. The sound still sounds great, but the wire coating is almost completely stripped!"
5,Help with bass response problems.,"It took me 5-6 tries with these headphones to figure this out, even after reading other reviews. When they say, ""in ear buds"", they mean IN THE EAR. You have to stick these babies seriously far into your ear. At first it may seem a bit uncomfortable. You have it right when outside sound is really muffled. A good way to do this is to play a song that has noticable bass, then gently press the headphone in until all of the sudden the bass comes in. I was about to throw these things away and write off the forty bucks until I figured this out.After doing this right, the sound quality goes from horrible to awesome. The headphones are still comfortable (compared to other ear buds) once you get used to jamming them halfway up your ear canal."
4,Good and Bad.,"Sound-wise, these are actually somewhat noise canceling. The provide a rich full sound with bass, which I have not been able to find in any of the Apple brand headphones.But the rubber coating on the wires do fall apart! I've started taping mine up with electrical tape.However I take them to the gym, and they get a rough workout in my purse. So if you are delicate with them they should last longer.Ultimately the sound quality and bass are such a plus I'm at a loss about what to do over the easily destroyed rubber."
3,"Sometimes good, Sometimes bad",I can never get a consistent feel for these. Sometimes they stay in my ears and pump out great sound. Most other times they won't stay in (even when I'm sitting perfectly still) and the sound is lacking the bass I desire.I think I'm going back to my old headphones.
1,"Great sound , poor quality material","I liked everything about these earphones until the wiring in the cord was exposed in 4 months and not just in areas touching the skin. I found the sound quality to be excellent for the price. The ear buds were very comfortable and fit great. The sound insulation was also very good for the price range. I wore these while working out at the gym or for walks. I noticed the cord starting to fray and by the 4th month the wiring was exposed in two places. Too bad, since I really like the sound quality and fit. Sony dropped the ball on the quality of the wiring on these."
2,"Great Sound, Poor Durability","I bought these for use with my MP3 player at the gym. The sound quality is fantastic and they do an excellent job of canceling out noise. But that is where the good things come to an end.Their durability (especially for an expensive headphone, I paid $40) is non-existent. I've gone through 3 pairs, each lasting about three to six weeks (exchanged at store), all lose the right-channel. This seems to be a serious issue with these headphones, I'd stay away from them for just that reason."
2,Dont buy.,I ended up purchasing 3 of these headphones and they only lasted a few weeks. The wires are so thin they short out. My brother bought the same pair thinking I just had bad luck and his did the same thing. They have great sound quality but sony needs to spend a little money upgrading their wires.
2,I keep losing the little rubber plugs,"hey, is it just me, or are those little rubber plugs on the headphones infuriatingly easy to lose?they are constantly falling off, everytime i try to retrieve them from my often crowded bag to listen to my ipod. More then once, i find myself frantically checking my bag and the floor around me as i find that they've fallen off again.now, finally... i've lost them both. i have no more plugs. sony store doesn't have any replacements and gave me a parts number to call. yeah, like that would be cheap.so, an otherwise perfecly functioning headphone set going to waste.I can't be the only one that has this problem, can i?oh, they sound ok enough. the performance for the price is pretty decent. I just wish there was some way to deal with the lost rubber tips."
2,pretty good sound with very short lifespan,"I had these headphones' sister product (MDR-EX71SL) for a while and loved them. They had great sound, were small, and were durable. So when they got stolen I considered these MDR-EX51LP because they were cheaper and were supposed to have the same innards.When I got these MDR-EX51LP, I felt their sound was good but I also made an unscientific observation that the sound was not as good as the MDR-EX71SL which are supposed to have the same innards. That was not a huge deal, though. What was a huge deal was that within a few months the cord was all kinked and the copper was exposed in one spot. I don't even use these to exercise, the cord is just made very cheaply."
1,"Poor Quality, Good Sound - I Would NOT Recommend","In 9 months, I have gone through 6 pairs of these headphones. They were a gift, so I could only exchange them. The sound is decent, but the build quality is awful. The problem has been the same on every pair - after a month or so, one ear phone would be barely audible while the other plays fine.Sony had better come up with a solution. A lot of people have had the same problems, and Sony won't own up to it and fix it.Since 1 pair hasn't lasted over 2 months, I would recommend staying away from these headphones until Sony corrects their issues."
4,Luv the price & the sound's not bad either!,LIKES:* PRICE* Portability* Noise cancellation* Decent sound quality even in loud environments like in a convertible or subway.DISLIKES:* Earbuds easy to fall off & lose* No 800# to call for earbuds replacement* Earbud material could cause sensitive reaction in ear canal
5,Surprise!! These earphones ARE good! I can't believe it!,"In the past I have always been skeptical about earbud-style earphones; they always seemed to lack depth and bass quality. But I guess in the past few years they have made enormous advancements in sound technology because these tiny litte earbuds rival my studio style Sony headphones. I couldn't believe that I was actually hearing high quality bass from these things. Not only is the sound quality superb, but they have to be the most comfortably fitting earphones I ever used as well! I bought these earphones for use with my new iPod 80GB. I highly reccommend purchasing these earphones for the iPod. They are a perfect match, especially when the iPod EQ is set to the Loudness setting (great bass and crisp treble). Definitely give these a try before you think about purchasing $100 earphones (if you are that crazy); I think you will find yourself more than satisfied with these earphones at $40 well spent."
4,GREAT EARPHONES BUT NEED EARBUD REPLACEMENT,"These are a great pair of ear phones. Best sound I've ever heard. I used these on my creative muvu txfm mp3 player and they work great at the gym. The pieces stay in my ear even with heavy physical activity (jogging, squating, various olympic lifts).ONE PROBLEM: I LOST ONE EAR BUD AND I NEED THE SILICONE REPLACEMENT ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN GET THAT? Looked on sony store site and here and its not available."
1,Great Sounding headphones with major design problems,"I have to admit that I love the way these headphones sound, however I couldn't get over some major problems with thier design and here are the problems:#1: The cord is way too long for regular use and because it has an 1/8"" connector on the middle of it, it continually pulls the buds out of your ear.#2: The cord is made out of a soft density rubber which wore out in 3 months and now is exposed copper wire. They are useless after only a few months of wear. This has been confirmed by a co-worker of mine who has had the same problem with his.#3: because of #1 you can't wear these headphoones while working out...which is why I bought nice earbuds to begin with!Because of these reasons I cannot recommend these heaphones."
2,No compare to Apple Ipod headset,This headset is only good for portable radio. I am very disappointed with the sound quality. I am not getting the good quality sound as compare to the original Ipod headset. I am returning it.
4,Okay for the money,These work fine for the money but they aren't as comfortable as my last pair of Sony headphones.
5,Worth for money,"Headphones are great, they are comfortable and come with three different ear bud sizes. Sound quality is also great. Bang for the buck."
1,Useless,I tried these earphones with my Creative ZEN mp3 player. The results were awful. I could almost not hear the bass sounds. These earphones ended in the garbage can after half an hour trying them.
3,Nice...while it lasted,"I bought these headphones on sale, so I wasn't expecting too much. The sound is pretty decent for the price they are asking. You won't get booming bass, but it comes through faintly and doesn't sound bad. The only problem is these things broke after only 4 months. Of course, the warranty only covers 90 days, so I'm stuck with $30 headphones that only transmit sound out of one side. Unless you can find these super cheap, save your money."
1,"Good sound, but terribly flimsy","I've gone through several pairs of these headphones and while they do sound pretty good (the bass in particular is quite nice), they break extremely easy. In the past 6 months I've probably gone through 4 pairs of these and at $40 a pop, I'm looking elsewhere for my next pair. If you plan to use these while working out, they seem especially prone to damage if you sweat a lot (I had one pair last about 4 days). After being burned too many times I'm going to try a pair of the Sennheiser sport headphones for working out and (possibly) something else for my everyday usage, but I'm not going back to these again unless I can't find a suitable alternative."
4,"Good, but not extraordinary","Pros: Sounds good, comfortable, and inexpensive.Cons: None that I can think of.Other: The wires are a bit strange. The right one is longer then the left almost as if it were added as an afterthought. Doesn't effect the sound though."
2,Short lived bliss,"When I first used these ear buds I thought they were better than any other. Unfortunately this didn't last long. Less than a month after purchasing the left ear ceased to work. I hadn't abused them or done anything to harm them, so my conclusion is that they simply burned out.My suggestion to purchasers is this: consider buying a less flimsy pair of ear buds. If you plan on using them more than once a week, I strongly recommend you don't choose to purchase these particular buds.However, this style of ear bud is my favorite. They are good at blocking out external noises and they are extremely comfortable. I recommend a pair of buds similar to these, but please think it over before you waste good money on something that will only last a few short weeks."
1,Can buy better Sony Headphones for less money,I bought the MDR-EX51LP Fontopia headphones to replace my Sony MDR-A35 sports headphones. I thought the direct fit in the ear might be even more comfortable than the A35's. The EX51LP's had much worse sound -- tinny and lower volume -- at a higher price than the A35's. And the fit wasn't so good -- they didn't stay in the ear very well. I was very disappointed.
4,nice buds,"These ear buds are quite comfortable and I like the minicase that comes with them, convenient to wind the cord around. Sound quality is good for the price."
3,Ok but not that great either.......not worth buying,The sound is not very soft....the quality of sound is.....i have used sony ericsson head sets that are much better than these. Might as well pay a bit more and get better quality earphones!!!
1,not what you get for the money,"I've gone through two pairs of these earphones, both white and black versions and about 8 months through the right or left ear piece died out. Sony only gives you a 90 day warranty so you are out of luck when these things die on you. I decided not to go for three and saved up a few extra bucks and bought the SHURE E2g's ($100 but really amazing).I highly do not recommend these earphones. Please save your money and buy something better."
1,These suck,"They sound bad and don't stay in your ear. Buy Sennheiser MX-500 they sound much better and are cheaper. Typical Sony, pay more get less. This is the last Sony product I will ever buy."
1,Piece of Junk,"Same story, great for a few months, then the right earbud stops working. Save your money, or pay a few bucks for something better."
1,The worst earphones I have used,"I am very frustrated with these as I was expecting them to be great after reading so many great remarks about them. They probably need to be pushed into the ear canal to sound any better and I find that dangerous as well as very inconvenient and hurting. They have very poor bass and the sound level is also very low. Unless some one could advise me how to wear them, I am giving them away."
2,where's the bass?,"So, I should have listened to the folks on here who said that these had poor bass response. they really do. I mean, they'll be fine for walking to work, where there is lots of background noise - but for just sitting and listening? not so much. Got these to replace my ipod buds, since I'm one of the millions out there whose ears don't fit the famous white headphones. The sonys fit great, feel good in my ears, which is the first time I've had a set of ear buds that did so. but damn, the sound quality is tinny with very little bass response. and, as someone else noted, they sound awful on the ipod on any EQ setting besides ""flat"" - try boosting the bass, and they go all crunchy really fast."
1,horrible,"My family has bought three of these on separate occasions and each time, slightly after the 90 day warranty expires, one of the earphones fails. It sounds good while it lasts, but low quality. We've now learned to avoid these.Then again it's Sony in 2006, so what else should we expect?"
2,Not worth the price,"I bought these as a replacement for my daughters stock ipod earphones that she damaged. I tried them out on a few songs and went back and forth between them and my ipod stock earphones. The sound was consistently inferior, bass wasn't as good and the highs sounded muted. The overall sound was not as crisp as the stock ipod earphones. Also, as others have mentioned, unless you keep the cords very still, the movement will generated am anoying wooshing noise. I actually found them to fit quite nice, and the plug style does a great job of canceling out outside noises. Overall they are a step down from the stock ipod earphones and at $15 more, not a good deal at all."
3,cords problem,"Well, I""ll be brief: The headphones sounds great, I'm not an audiophile, but usually like to try different set of headphones. The problem is that after 6 months of use my cords just dissolved, as everybody else... That's it."
1,Great sound but...,"... mine failed after 4 months of use. One ear went completely dead. I then discovered Sony's warranty is only 90 days and they refused to repair them (except for almost as much as I paid for them). Later I took them apart to discover if I could fix them - often one of the wires breaks inside the cord or a wire will become desoldered from the driver - and discovered the driver was dead. Infinite resistance. I didn't use them a great deal and never played them loud. I won't buy Sony headphones again, despite the great sound."
5,Great Sound,Kiss the pain of ear buds goodbye. These fit comfortably in your ear with great sound overall (including the low end). A great way to block out the noise of the world and enjoy good tunes.
3,"Mediocre sound, better than ipod earbuds","these are ok sounding 'phones. they have pretty good isolation but the bass is too boomy and highs are harsh and hurt my ears sometimes if mod them they sound a little better. overall, pretty good for $20"
4,Great lightweight inear phones,"I had a pair before these (lost 'em). The pro is they are very compact, fit into a very small pouch, and they sound very good, akin to my Shure E2c's. For the price you can't beat 'em. The con is the wires are very thin, so be careful, they can stretch or break if you yank on them. Ear fit is fine. Bass is there for sure."
5,Sony In-Ear Headphones - Excellent Value,"Between my wife and I we have had 4 pairs of these earphones and everyone of them were excellent. I have tried a couple of different brands of similar (in ear) design headphones and I keep on going back to Sony. The sound quality has been excellent, very well balanced unlike other brands that tend to bias the bass too much. Two things I wished they'd do with these, shorten the cord about 6-8 inches, and make the connection to the plug more durable as 2 of our earphones have failed this way."
4,Sony MDR EX51LP Ear Buds Are a Good Value,"I originally had Sony MDR-EX71LP's for $49.99. They delivered well-balanced sound and they lasted a long time. When it was time to purchase another set, I found they discontinued the model. After trying several types, including more expensive Sony models, which either had too much bass and/or a muffled high end, I considered the MDR-EX51LP's to have better sound and a great price.The EX51LP sound is reasonably well-balanced, although they are somewhat tinny at the high end. They certainly have, but don't boom, the bass. I use them to watch TV rather than listen to music, which was especially helpful when I used to live near an airport. As I use them in this manner, having moderate bass and a clear high end are both plusses. The set comes with an additional 2' extension cord to give you some extra room."
4,Great Little Earbuds,"These earphones were cheap, and very good quality. I've read complaints about hearing yourself chew, etc... but for me it hasn't been a problem. I have a cheap pair of JVC's (about $10) that produce near the same quality sound, but these are way more comfortable. It's true, the cord is a bit too short, but for all my purposes, it's been long enough.Regardless, if you're looking for a good set of earphones, then these are worth purchasing. I've also tried Sennheiser's, and I think I made the right decision with these."
3,Earphones for tiny ears,"I have really small ears and I've always had a difficult time finding earphones that work. I tried the over-the-ear type, but they don't really work that well when you're trying to work out (they always come off). A friend recommended these. They fit really well and don't pop out of my ear when I work out, but the sound quality is not as good as I hoped."
3,"Decent, not amazing","These need to be used with eq- the high end is very brittle, even irritating with some devices. Low and mids are pleasing. The asymmetrical cable, I thought, would be no big deal or a nice change of pace- didn't like it. The cable, going from on earbud to the other, is always hanging close to the neck and pulling more on one ear than the other. Now I know there's a reason 99% of phones are not made like this."
5,EXCELLENT HEADPHONES!!!,"I got these for Christmas because they are comfortable and have boosting bass! AND BOY was I right, they are amazing. If you do not like these headphones get the song ""Your Biggest Mistake"" by New Found Glory my son let me listen to it with these headphones and it blew me away!"
2,Materials and Workmanship,"It is a good thing that Sony has a warranty on these. When I pay $35 for a set of headphones, I expect that they last.While these still have great sound, the sheething on the outside of the wires is just disentigrating.I won't be buying this brand again.This is also the case for every pair of the Funtopia headphones that I have seen."
1,2 pairs in 6 months! Very poorly constructed product.,"I have purchased 2 pairs in less than 6 month and both have suffered from same spliting of the connector cable, and subsequent loss of sound in one of the earpieces.The customer pictures above are precisely what happened to mine. VERY poor construction for a somewhat $37.99 product, my 10.00 pair has comprable sound quality and is 10 times as durable.I also had the pleasure of contacting Sony about the product and was subjected to a very long hold time(over 25 minutes!)and a rude and condescending rep who thought it was outrageous that I didn't keep reciepts for every purchase I have ever made. They basically agreed to ""replace"" the product if I sent the old ones back and paid for a new pair. Shame on you Sony! This is the last of your products I ever purchase!"
2,great headphones that are short lived,"I have owned two pair of these earphones now, one black and one white. The white pair lasted less that 4 months, the black pair just over 6. I keep them in a compartment in my messenger bag, along with my iPod nano, to use on the bus or if I am walking around downtown. They are not subjected to any out of the ordinary stress, but in both cases, the Right earbud suddenly stops working. Just goes dead. I had the second pair die this morning when I got on the bus. So today, I need to buy new ones...but twice is more than enough chances for these. Sad thing is, I really liked the sound and the fit they had...but 4-6 months of lifespan is worthless...especially when they are not treated roughly."
1,"Bad Headphones, Bad Customer Service","I bought it as a gift for my sister. Two days after using them, the right headphone completely disattached itself. I called Sony,and after waiting 40 minutes for customer service I was told that I was to ship them to Texas at my OWN COST and that they would determine whether I deserve to get a new pair, and if I do, I would get a refurbished pair because mine had been ""used."" So they tell me that they have a special deal with UPS, so I go there, and I was told it would cost me $13+ to ship it so they can TEST whether I deserve a refurbished pair. I will never buy another Sony product after this experience."
1,Terrible!,"I bought these headphones in May 2003 to accompany my new iPod. They did not last six months of normal use: walking to and from class and sitting unused in my pocket. One of the buds stopped producing music, rendering them almost useless. They only come with a three month manufacturer warranty and Sony will charge more than half the cost of the headphones to send them off to be repaired. Not worth it. The ex71-lp model phones seem to be of much better quality and might make it to the 6 month mark!"
2,Suprisingly poor quality for the Fontopia line,"I bought these for my iPod, because I liked the sound quality from my friend's higher-end Fontopia in-ear phones. The technical specs looked great for the 51LP phones, but the audio quality just didn't match what I was expecting.In particular, the phones clipped low frequencies even at moderate volume levels. The result was a noticably muddier/rougher sound than the iPod's included headphones. The high frequency response was much better, and I have no complaints on that end.The three included sizes of rubber covers were a nice touch, as you can custom-fit the phones for your ears. Also, the remarkably simple carrying case is just marvelous -- no more tangled cords.One other thing to be aware of -- like all ""ear-sealing"" earbuds, these will block out most external noise and act like stethescopes. So if you're doing something dangerous (running, lion taming, etc.) you might want to try before you buy to make sure it won't be a problem for you."
2,great for awhile,"The sound from these buds is wonderful, and they fit great.but, the con is after about a month or less,the covering over the wires deteriorates leaving the wires exposed.I have owned two sets and it's happened both times.So basically they are a waste of money due to that fact."
2,"Good sound, Bad quality.","I bought these earbuds from Amazon in May this year. I use them when I do my daily walks. The Sound is very pleasing using my mp3 player, and isolation is fairly good.The problem I have is after 2 months the wire covering that came in contact with my skin began to desolve. It has completely come off the left earbud down to the ""y"" connection and some of the right side covering is also desolving.If you contact ""Sony"" within 90 days of purchase they will replace the earbuds. After that your on your on."
2,greatt sound cheap rubber,The sound is great fromthese ear buds. IN fact the best I have heard even from ones much more expensive. However the rubber on thecords is very cheap and sheds very easily. What a shame! If they could only put a nice durable cord cover on these would be superb.
2,They are great when they work.,My second pair just crapped out. The left ear went dead on my first pair after about 4 months of use. On my latest pair that is less than a month old the right earbud died. I'll be returning them if possible.
2,Underwhelming at best,"Ok let me make this as simple and clear as I can. These headphones are intuitively designed, but they're not the best for your money. I recently bought the EX51's to replace my Koss PLUG earphones which went belly up on me this week.What I like:SizeComfortStylingWhat I don't like:Bass quality (too tinny, even shoved all the way into the ear canal)Cord design (its supposed to be comfortable, yet the damn short end pulls the earplug out if you're moving)Sound volume (I normally listened to my music on a 20-21 out of 40 setting on my Iriver H10. With these I needed it jacked up to almost a 35 for the same sound)Bottom line, save your money and buy the Koss ""the plug"" earphones. Better all around sounds/tones and they're cheaper!"
1,avoid at any cost,"I bought these headphones from amazon a couple of months back. They worked OK for a month, but with poor response at higher frequencies. I guess you shouldn't get them unless you are a trance music addict or something. After a month they just failed. The volume dropped to barely audible levels, and the headphones are useless now. Talk about throwing money away. Don't ever buy this product no matter how ""cheap"" it looks. It doesn't do that well when it works, and it doesn't work for that long."
5,Simply amazing....,"I went ahead and bought these even after reading several bad reviews about the cords falling apart. That was a little over a year ago and mine are still like brand new - and I wrap the cord around my mp3 player constantly. The sound is amazing...but make sure the earpieces are pushed in properly. They sit farther inside the ear than expected. That makes them block outside noise as well. Also, after finding the right earpiece size, they're very comfortable. These are excellent for the price! If mine decide to die, I'm definitely going to buy another pair."
3,Not completely satisfied,"Why did Sony make the wires leading to each head phone asymmetrical? Couldnt they just keep them both the same length and place one of those plastic zipper things in the middle that allows you to adjust both wires? The plastic ear bud piece carrier is a joke too. Could they have made it any more fragile?On the other hand...The ear buds are perfect for people with slightly different sized ear canals, and they deliver very crisp sound. It comes with 3 different sizes, so youre probably going to get a nice fit. If you plan on being stationary these head phones are a great choice. If you plan on running/or biking with these, think again. They are constantly coming loose from my left ear because of the poorly engineered wire length."
4,Sony MDR EX51 LP Headphones,"I have good news and bad news.First the good news.These headphones have awesome sound. They fit snugly and comfortably in the ear and do not fall out when I exercise.Now the bad. The insulation material is flimsy. I've already caused bare wire, and I don't handle them roughly. They are useless to me now. Too bad."
2,"Purchased in December, already broken","I purchased these headphones in December 2005 for use at work. They never left my desk- they went into my ears and back into the case every day. Not exactly arduous use. Five months later, the right bud stopped working. I did like the fit in my ears and the sound, but what's the point if they'll only last a few months? Not recommended."
3,"Good value, but too much bass","I purchased these to replace my i-pod earbuds that were defunct. Fit is good and the in-ear design does a great job blocking out ambient sounds at my work place. Two issues with the ear-plug design: 1) any bump or scrape of the cord is transmitted to the plugs, and 2) don't plan to eat anything while wearing these-- potato chips will sound like Godzilla eating Tokyo if you have these on. Bass was way way over emphasized, and i-pod had to be set to ""bass reducer"" equalization.---- update: after using the ear buds for a couple of months, I've found a couple of things: First, the bass response is dependant on how securely and deeply you get the buds into your ears, so your results will probably vary based on your own anatomy. Second, the little rubber ear plug thingies have started falling off of the phones, so I have no doubt I will loose one soon."
2,Decent Sound for the Money but Poor Durability,"These headphones produce good sound relative to the stock buds that come with most players; definately a worthwhile upgrade. But....Durability is lacking. The rubber covering on the cords separates easily. This happened on my buds and my wifes EX71's. After about 3 months of regular use I was patching the cords with electrical tape after 5 months one side went dead.Other gripes..... these are the most tangle prone buds I've ever owned. You turn your back for a second and they're balled and knotted up. Also, the ear insert pieces, while comfortable, easily pop off and get lost....usually when you're untangeling the cord."
1,Bassless claims,"I'm sorry, guys, but I have to agree that the bass on these things is simply awful. Yes, I've tried the different size earpieces and I've made sure they're in all the way to create a proper seal and so on and so on, but the sound is still totally pathetic. I'm no bass-hungry kid, either. I wouldn't care if the bass was just a little bit weak, but this is just not acceptable.Maybe it's a manufacturing thing. Maybe most of the reviewers here are getting perfectly good units, and some percentage are getting units that are actually defective and should be returned. It actually doesn't matter. Judging by the reviews that percentage must be pretty high. I don't continue purchasing from vendors with those kinds of defect rates and I don't recommend them to anyone else either."
5,EXCELLENT HEADPHONES,"THESE HEADPHONES ARE EXCELLENT !! GREAT SOUND QUALITY, AND I RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR GREAT SOUND THROUGH HEADPHONES !!"
3,"sound awesome, quality POOR.","sony has gone DOWNhill in recent years. my sony vaio breaks, my over-the-head sony earphones snapped three times, all while under warranty, until i just gave up, and THESE EARBUDS ARE NO EXCEPTION. i love love love the sound, so much so that it has taken me FOUR pairs to learn my lesson, and i actually write to you today because i'm about to buy another. but this time i'm buying the extended warranty."
1,Not so good,"Just got these last night. I also bought my son a pair of Marshmallow ear buds. Comparing the two, these are horrible. The Marshmallows sound MUCH better. These have NO base whatsoever. I'll be returning them, and buying the Marshmallows or SOMETHING ELSE."
1,"This is one the worst earphone I ever had...As picture shown above, I only had about a month and it teared up....","This is one the worst earphone I ever had...As picture shown above, I only had about a month and the wires tear up...."
2,no bass... no love.... and sending it back to get my money,Ugghhh I bought these to replace my broken Sony MDR-888 and they are horrible. It can't handle bass whatsoever. It has very shallow bass and plenty of high frequencies. I'm returning these immediately.I hate to admit it but I switched back to my old IPOD headphones because it sounded better- believe it or not.They fit nice and snug but the sound is nothing compared to my old headphones.
2,Moronic Design,"Although the sound quality of these headphones is acceptable, the moronic design of the wiring chronicled in other reviews here makes these a ""STAY AWAY,"" especially if you plan to use them for any type of physical fitness activity.Instead of using equal length wires for each earphone that meet in the center (the design featured in virtually every other headphone in existence), Sony has for some asinine reason decided to make the left cord far shorter than the right. Essentially, the feed for both headphones connects to the left. This means that these headphones get caught on nearly everything.If you plan to run and/or go to the gym with these headphones, get ready to feel the left one ripping out of your ear repeatedly, even after small movements.Back to the drawing board, Bozos."
1,worst headphone for 25$,even a $5 piece can beat this one in sound quality and comfort. I am surprised this headphone gets this much postive feedback.Very uncomfortable to usetotally lacks bassI had come across a review where the white ones were better than the black(I got the black one)You are wasting money if you are going for this one.I am going to throw away mine.
1,A very dissapointing offering from Sony,The quality slide continues at Sony unabated. These headphones are lack luster at best. Spend a little more and get SOMETHING for your money.
1,Sony MDR-EX51LP Black/Silver Headphones,I ordered a black and silver set and a white set. The black and silver headphones' sound quality isn't as good as the white set I purchased even though they're the same model. I have to turn the volume all the way up to hear them.
1,EARPHONES,"These were a present for my 18 yr old son. He loved the headphones! They felt good in his ears & were comfortable. BUT they broke after 1 month! Amazon.com, of course, is taking them back!"
1,Not very good,"Tried these out at the local Sony store. Even with the largest size fitting, these earphones suffered from very poor isolation. The sound qulity was abysmal, and the earphones are not sensitive."
4,Buy online to save,The earbuds have good sound. I have smaller ears and find them very comfortable. The earbuds that came with my mp3 were just too big. The only thing that I don't like about them is that the wire is offset and pulls to one side. If they had a shorter distance between your ears and the wire was centered from them I think it would be more comfortable.
3,"Great sound, bad cable material",I have now had this pair of headphones for about 1.5-2 years now. They sound great. I have taken very careful care with these as I had read reviews about the cable being fragile.IMPORTANT: IT IS TRUE! The cables are now frayed. The material used is a soft rubber and just seems to break down with time even with careful care. I would certainly not pay $40 dollars for these (that is what I payed 2 years ago).CARE INSTRUCTIONS: I would suggest carrying them around in an altoid box. You can ditch the earpiece protector they provide. It is junk and the earpieces aren't whats going to break. The altoids box is large enough to provide ample protection and so that you don't have to keep crunching your cables up to get it inside the case they provide.
2,Not Very Good Headphones,These headphone sounded okay. They are the first earbud headphones I've tried. They just didn't compare to the Sony V6 headphones I've grown to love. I sent the Fontopia Headphones back.
2,Does not work for people with smaller ears,"I love sony products, and have been a long time user of sony headphones of various different styles. Unfortunatly, these ""ear-bud"" style headphones are not small enough for my ears. The smallest size fit uncomfortably and so I decided to give them to my dad - who loves them. The medium size silicone fit him just right and he loves the sound quality.. Thankfully someone was able to appriciate these ear buds. However, the asymetrical cord was confusing and not useful. Besides the ambient noise blocking and the sony-sound quality these ear buds were not that great.. but for the price i guess they are comprable."
2,"Great sound, poor cords...","Trust the user reviews on here - the cords for these great earphones really do wear out after 2-3 months. They literally disintegrate. It's not worth buying these 4 times a year when you can get a better pair (Shure e3c?) for a little more.It's a real shame because the sound and comfort of these earphones (for the good price) can't be beaten. I used them on airplanes, I used them at the gym, at work - most noise gets blocked out brilliantly. The bass levels are strong, since the earbud goes into your air - if this is a problem, adjust the equalizer on your audio device.I was over the moon for the first 2 months with these. I will NOT buy again though - I've been through 2 pairs and until Sony fix the flimsy wiring, you should avoid this set of earphones."
4,"Great sound, awkward cord","I bought these to replace the iPod earbuds because they kept falling out of my ears. The Sony earbuds definitely stay put. You can be very active in them without knocking them out. They sound great. The only problem I have with them is that the cord is shorter on one side than the other. This makes them awkward to store in anything. The included ""case"" is junk and never would stay closed. I still have not found a good way to store them."
3,Theres better ones for the same price!,"headphones are alright, they have to be deep in your ear canal to get the full effect of the bass and sound,when you move around you can really notice there in there which kinda sucks i would probably recommend the ipod headphones over this preticular model which costs about the same.Apple iPod In-Ear Headphones"
1,Consistently die after only a few weeks!,"These are the only earphones I can find that are comfortable in my ear. However, I have had probably 5 or 6 pairs of these and they always die out after about 6 to 10 weeks of use (and after any warranty or return policy has expired). They will suddenly go too quiet to hear them one side and then the other. Maybe I am the only the one with the problem, but I would not recommend these!"
1,Not for the active user,"The sealed ear pieces feel great and reproduce bass great, but if you plan on using this headset where you'll be active, forget it! Any contact with the cable transmits noise to the left ear piece. So if you're moving about on a treadmill or stairmaster, the cable moving about and coming into contact with your body will result in alot of noise in your left ear. My advice is to buy something else if you plan on using your headset at the gym."
1,Terrible bass,"I was looking for some earbuds to replace the stock ones that came with my creative MuVo TX. Mostly I was looking for better sound isolation, so that I would hear more of my music and less outside noises. These headphones did an okay job of this, unfortunately the traffic sounds of outside were preferable to the music put out by these earbuds. The sound was tinny and flat, with practically no bass. I was amazed that these could be so much worse than my player's stock headphones. I tried the different plug sizes, and I'm sure I had them deep enough in my ears. Thoroughly dissapointing."
3,These didn't work for me,"I do understand that they work great for some people, but for whatever reason I am unable to insert them into my ear canal such that they become closed ear with the resulting superior bass and blocking of outside noise.My other complaint is that as you walk, the cord moves around and you hear a thumping in your ears.I find that I like the inexpensive $10 Sony earbuds that rest outside your ear canals a lot better. They are much more comfortable for me.At least they didn't cost too much. I'd sure be mad if I spent $100 on headphones that I didn't like."
4,Pleasant surprise,"I bought these after several (SEVERAL) attempts at finding comfortable, nice sounding headset, that would actually stay in my ears. I have a small ear canal, so it makes it difficult. Sony makes a nice sound, not perfect...but not irritating. I walk every day, and these are comfortable, and thankfully...stay put."
5,Good sound and very comfortable,"I really like these earphones. They produce very good sound and yet are very compact - great for working out and running.For the ladies who may think of purchasing them, here's another reason. Many of the earbud-style headset are very uncomfortable because the ""buds"" are too big and too rigid. These are not, they are small and pliable and the earpiece itself is very soft. They are perfect for our small ears!!!"
2,90 day warranty - lasts only 95 days,The left ear piece stopped functioning 5 days out of warranty. Otherwise it is a great product.
2,Not the greatest.,"The right side stopped putting out bass. Sound quality wasn't as good as i'd hoped for. I had Koss before these, and they sounded better."
5,"Great Value, Great Product","These headphones are some of the best I have ever purchased. They have great sound quality and really block out other noises. I have purchased two of these, one about 1.5 years ago and another just a few weeks ago when the first ones broke. 30 bucks for these comfortable headphones is a great deal. I would recomend buying these headphones if you want to block out noise, have great sound quality and want a great value."
4,Good for the money,Nice bang for the buck. The pods do stay in your ears well and do not need to be adjusted. I purchased them for the purpose of using them at the gym or running. Sound quality is decent but if you are looking for exceptional soumd these are not the pods for you.
2,Not so great,"These are OK for the money (great Amazon price compared to BestBuy/Target), but like the JVC $9.99 earbuds or Bose $139 much better.PROs: good outside noise exclusionCONs: hardly any bass, didn't fit well in my earSome people really like these, but didn't work well for me."
2,"Decent sound, but rubber disintigrates","The rubber coating disintegrates after a few months. Major product design flaw. Sony says it's due to heat and sweat getting on the rubber, these should be conditions headphones can endure. The sound quality is good, but the price is too high for something that will only last 4 months."
4,"Noise preventing, noise cancelling","Sony makes a set of these that cost $100 more and feature electronic noise cancellation. Frankly, these do the job 85% as well. I can only conclude that the inside-the-ear fit of this style earbud is what really helps with listening in a noisy environment. I use these on airplanes a lot, and even when I'm not listening to anything I'll sometimes use them as earplugs.Soundwise? I think they're fine. They sound good, and I've never been convinced that the output of my i-thing will sound tremendously better on some $200 or $400 dollar shure/etymyopic buds. I'm sure a layperson could hear _some_ difference, but not enough to worry about (I imagine the kind of person who would worry about that is saving up for a $5000 oxygen-free-copper interconnect.)Durability-wise, I've used my current pair for three years with no problems. I'd buy these again in a heartbeat."
4,really good isolation,"The sound is really good, and I really feel in another world when I listen to my music with these headphones. The sonor isolation is really good. And They are really comfortable too"
2,Great Sound! Serious Flaws.,"First: these headphones sound great if you use them correctly. They have to be pushed very far into your ear canal to work properly; once they're in, though, they sound amazing.However, like several other people on this board, the right bud dies between 6 weeks and 6 months of use. It's happened twice to me, both times just slightly out of warranty (do they design these things to fail just after your warranty expires!?). I thought it was my fault the first time the right earbud croaked, but several months after purchasing my second set and keeping it in PRISTINE condition, the right earbud died on that set as well.Conclusion: 5 stars for sound, 1 star for build, making my final score 2 stars."
3,"Good sound quality, bad build quality...","I'm on my second pair of these headphones and I really like the sound quality. The sad thing is that I'm about to have to buy yet another pair as the right headphone has stopped working. If you get these make sure you get an extended warranty because they will break after a few months. For the money, though they're still the best on the market, if you ask me."
3,Bad design,"The earbuds are small and look nice. Sound is good. More confterable than the sony ex71.But the design! what does sony think? we are all giants? And this goes for most of sony's earbuds! im average guy.. 5'8"" 150 lbs. The wrap around the neck design isn't that bad ...unless the right cord is waaaaayyy too long around 20 inches i think. I look rediculus with 4+ inches of wire dangling around my neck and to the side of my ear. Also when i put my mp3 player into my pants pocket when i have the earbuds on, there is wire dangling out and i have to make a concious effort to push the rest of the wire back into my pocket. Its not as long (bad) as the ex71s but it is still very annoying."
2,"Bah, stupid cords...","I bought two of these, one for my brother, the other for myself. I bought these based on the initial reviews a few months ago. The sound quality is excellent for the price, but like others have recently mentioned, the cord is pure crap. If I tried, I am positive I can cut the cord in half with my finger nails. This is unacceptable.What good are the earbuds without the cord?"
1,Very Dissappointing,"I bought these earbuds because I thought they looked like a decent deal. Big mistake, these headphones have been trouble from the beginning. First problem, the sound quality. It's not that is weak, it's that it has strong...strong...VERY strong bass. Now, I like bass, it gives music a punch, but this is overpowering. I have broke them in for a month, and there is still harshness in the bass. The treble is okay, but very high treble is not very detailed. Secondly, I hate that the wires are all screwed up. A Y design would've been fine! Also, is the price. Unless you buy online, they are around the $40 mark. Last, but not least, is the durability. Four months, and the right side died. I'm actually happy about this. I went out to Circuit City and bought the RP-HJE50. All good. Avoid the EX51!!!"
1,"Great sound, but heaven help you if you lose an earpiece!","I love the sound these earbuds produce, but after some use, the interchangeable ear pads start wanting to fall off. The replacement pads that Sony packages with this product are either too big or too little for most people, so the medium ones that come on it are the best size, and yet no extra mediums are included. I'm going to have to order replacements off ebay. I am not impressed with that lack of foresight, since as of right now I have one gigantic and one teeny pad on my pair of Sony earbuds."
1,Find something else -,"I bought these @ Circuit City for $39.99 to replace the Apple headphones that came with my nano. The Apple brand headphones are large and uncomfortable, sometimes falling out of my ear when I work out. So my coworker said he got a pair of Sonys and they were very comfortable. Hence my purchase of these...TOTAL GARBAGE - the sound quality is terrible... I tried every one of the 22 EQ settings on the iPod and they all sound tinny and cheap. I'm really surprised b/c Sony is known for their quality. Not in this case. If you need a quick replacement and can get these for $2, it might be a good deal. Otherwise keep looking.NOTE: I did give one star b/c they are pretty comfortable, at least compared to the Crapple headphones."
3,Multiple Pairs - Different Materials!,"I'm on my 3rd pair of these and now I understand why people's reviews are so different ... The other two pairs had great bass -- but the cords felt rubbery and eventually fell apart. The latest pair has horrible sound, but thinner, more durable cords. Exact same model number. I even tried using the silicone ear bud covers from my old pair to see if the fit in my ear was different. The sound is still flat. I'd rather the cord fall apart after 6 months as long as the music sounded good."
2,Product description inadequate,"I bought these earbuds to use with a Jabra BT320S, paired with an LG VX8600, and they do sound quite nice. So it breaks my heart that I can't give it a stellar rating. One star for actually having decent sound. One more star for having a 90-degree gold plated plug. And there it stops, two stars.Nowhere in the product description does it say it has severely uneven lengths of cord for the right and left (J-cord). Yes, I understand this ""feature"" is sometimes highly regarded, but I would like to be INFORMED that this ""feature"" is incorporated in the product before I buy it. If I had known it had this ""feature,"" I would have moved on to another product and not wasted my time and money with this one."
4,"Great item ,slow shipping",Works great and is very confortable. There was one small issue it took a long time to receive the product through the mail. Although I have used the free shipping before it it has never taken two weeks to receive an item. The product itself is great.
4,Decent Headphones for the Price!,"I use these headphones at work while sitting in my cubicle. When I was shopping I was looking for a pair of headphones that would reduce the noise around me but not feal like I was wearing earmuffs. These buds are good on both accounts. The sound quality is very good as well. As previous reviewers have mentioned, there is a definite ""stethescope effect"" with these, but if you can get past that these headphones are really great!"
4,Reccommended,"Sounds great. It will reveal sounds in your music you would not hear with cheap ones. Blocks all outside noise so it's great for long flights. I have to take 'em off intermittenly when using them for extend amount of time. If you wear it with the wire hanging behind it will catch and fall off easily if your head don't stay still. That aside, I'm quite happy with it."
3,"Good sound, but poorly crafted for working out","The sound quality is better than that of the ear buds that came with my IPOD. I also like the outside noise reduction. However, I use mine for working out and I don't think these best suit that purpose due to the cord. The cord is much too long, it doesn't wind up, and the gathering point of the headphones is off center. All of the above causes it to get caught easily when working out. The speakers are also sensitive to any fast motions which is often triggered by a bouncing cord. Overall good, but I would purchase something different next time for my needs."
2,Good for a while...,"I'll keep this short and sweet. It worked for a couple of months but then for some reason, one of the buds (the longer one) decided not to work (the volume is just very low) and now I only have one working earbud that essentially cost me $25."
2,only good for heavy bass,"I thought this Sony can be a good replacement of the original ipod ear-bud, but I am wrong. At normal frequency range, the sound quality is very pale, while bass stands out un-naturally. You basically listen to some cheap ear-bud plus a drum punching your ear.It could be good to hook it up to CD player. It shows flaws of MP3, especially painful in classic music. The original ipod headphone somehow can hide the details, this sony is much more strait forward.The plug is secure when you work out. It filters out the noise of the treadmill perfectly. However, the fraction of your ear and the rubber plug makes loud noise itself, and you hear your heart beating in Hi-Fi quality as well.Overall, I think this is a very sophisticated designed gadget fits neither my way of using nor my wallet."
2,Hate cord,"I bought these about a year ago. Although I have not had any issues with disintegrating cord yet, I am rating them low due to the design. I use them at the gym and find the long/short cord design strange, and they do not stay in my ears well. I spend alot of time jamming them back in. Also, I find the cord way too long and have to wrap it around my iPod several times, and even then I find my arm while running rips one or the other out. Yuk."
2,Very disappointed with the quality,"Very disappointed with the qualityI have already went through 2 pairs of those headphones, in a period a little over half of a year. In both of these cases, the wires melted and it had to be thrown away.I am debating rather to get another pair. Though I am totally in love with the headphones, I don't think I can afford buying products with such poor quality.I encourage everyone who experienced the same problems to voice their concern or complain. I am sure if it becomes of a big enough of an issue, Sony will eventually step up and make some changes. Its just a matter of time.Oh also, if you are thinking about buying these headphones for running or jogging. Please consider a different type of headphone, for this headphone will probably last you about 3 month."
1,Less than a month and they fall apart!,"I purchased these to replace my EX71's which I still have but the ear pieces were worn out. I liked the design without the extender better than the 71 model but they just fell apart as the rubber wore out to bare wire in a matter of weeks. They sound good, and are comfortable but just constucted of poor quality material on th wires.Now that I look closer, I see lots of similar complaints and they are now 50% off to dump them. I have returned them for a refund but was charged a hefty fee, so buyer beware!"
1,"Bad product, bad service.","After seven months of mild usage (during which time the sound quality was pretty decent), the rubber insulation started stripping away and the headphones stopped working entirely. Contacted Sony customer service, and the only option they offered was to replace the headphones with a refurbished pair for $25. (A new pair is cheaper than that on Amazon.)Boo, hiss. I'll know not to buy Sony next time."
3,"good, but not so","Facts-The cord is really long-It will fit your ears very good-Sounds nicei just have 3 days with it, i have a sansa e260, and the sound its almost equal to the earphones that comes along with the player, i dont recomend this product if you already have an earphones or earbuds cuz probably (if the quality is a lil' decent) the sound wont be much better and the price is too high, i dont recomend this product at least u want something with just a decent quality at a expensive price."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought these earphones as an addition to the Koss earphones I already own. The sound is OK, but not as good as I expected and the ""holder"" is a joke. Would not buy them again at any price. The Koss earphones are better quality, better sound and a real pouch to hold them for less money."
5,Waterproof! And Blonde-proof!!!,"I accidentally put these headphones through the washing machine and to my surprise they still work great!! The sound is great, they are perfect, they never fall out of my ears and never grow uncomfortable. The rubber piece doesn't tare or come off easily like the last headphones I purchased. I have no complaints about these headphones other then the fact that the cords are too long."
3,Good sound - but easy to lose rubber cup!,"The positives - great isolation from outside noises, variety of earbud sizes to ensure fit. I usually listen to spoken radio (NPR, etc.), not music, and therefore can't comment much on sound quality. The negatives - any tiny tug on the wires, and the silicone cup separates from the speaker. Sometimes the bud stays in my ear, but usually it goes flying. Replacement cups are $5 EACH (plus shipping), and I've lost two in a year and a half. The rubbery surface of the wires (like the kind of stuff you put under a rug to make it stop sliding on the floor) make them prone to catching on coat sleeves, backpack straps, etc., which only makes them more prone to being yanked out of the ears. The capsule case that comes with the headphones are a joke. The bottom line - I will not buy these again. Too bad, because I really like the isolation."
2,Neck chain is annoying,These in the ear headphones have very good sound. The problem I have with them is the design of the cord. The main cord that connects to the player is suspended from the left ear. The neck chain cord connects to the right ear. I am an avid runner. With the weight of the main cord only on the left ear it creates a constant tugging feeling on the left ear. Meanwhile the neck chain is bouncing up and down into my chin as I run. I wish it had a traditional V cord.
4,As good as any,I haven't spent eighty dollars on headphones and I don't see why you would need to. These are great.
1,Not Suitable for Music,"The sound quality was so disappointing -- tinny, no bass, poor volume. They do indeed stay in your ear while jogging, and insulate well from outside noise, but they are suited only to books on tape and other voice applications -- not music."
5,Fabulous EarBuds!,"I have had these over a year now - I use them at the gym, on airplanes, the bus, walking the dog, you name it. I've NEVER had an issue with wires fraying, sound quality or anything like that...What I love is that there are optional ear piece covers - if you have small ears like mine, it's hard to find a in-ear device that works well and doesn't hurt your ears or fit into your ears. They also have cover for medium and larger ears, very easy to change out and clean, too.I would say these are the best I own. I just bought a second pair to leave at work for my computer there. My husband just bought a set because he was sick of me complaining about him using mine!For the price 5 stars - It's sill to pay over $50 for earbuds (in my opinion)."
4,"Great headphones, but...","These headphones are great. I love these headphones, they have great bass and they do cancel outside noises. The only problem is, that they break easily that is why I purchased a 2 year replacement plan along with them. Guess what? As soon as my headphones broke I called my warranty company and explained the problem I had with my headphones (left ear phone stopped working). They asked me to ship back the headphones and that they would send me a check to cover the full purchase price.I received the check today and I have no complaints. I can now purchase my headphones again =D. So, for those of you who are planning on buying these headphones don't forget to purchase an extended warranty plan along with it! You'll be paying $5.99 more, but it's worth it!"
1,wires fall apart,"Sony really needs to work on their quality. The sound is very good for the price but the material coating the wires falls apart very quickly. I purchased two pairs figuring that the first was just a freak incident. Sure enough, within a few months the same problem emerged with the wires on the second unit. I called Sony and explained the problem and they basically told me shove off, though they are clearly aware of the problem. I can't imagine why they are surprised by their decline in fortunes as a company."
5,Great replacement for awful Ipod earbuds,"I bought a set of these on October 14, 2005 and today July 30, 2008 I accidentally got one side stuck in a folding chair and ripped one side off. The other side still worked. I've used them numerous times each week. The rubber cord started to deteriorate about 6 months ago, yet they continued to play music and I vowed to use them until they quit.If you are like me and your ears start to hurt after using the cheap plastic ipod headphones after about 5 minutes these are a great $20 alternative. I have worn mine for many hours even slept with them in using them to block out back ground noise.I'm reordering another pair."
1,I expected better from a name like Sony!?,Very disappointed in value for the money. I have two sets and the cables on both disintegrated after less than a month of normal (non-strenuous) use! Suggest buying a product from another manufacturer with similar design/sound quality until Sony improves theirs.
3,Long yet short cord,This closed end head phones delivers decent sound with a reasonable noise reduction than any other ordinary headphones. But the headphones cords are poorly designed. Its is very short for an average person and comes with uselessly long extension
4,Sound 5 - Durability 2,"Like other customers, I have found the sound on these headphones to be excellent for the price. They *do* block out a lot of ambient noise. However, also like other customers, I am starting to encounter problems with the rubber convering the wires. After about two months of use, it has started to fall apart. It only happens to the parts that touch my neck, but it is quite clear where the problem is.Also, for those who might be confused about their use, the headphones are marked with an 'L' and 'R' - the right earpiece goes around the back of the next and into the ear. Apparently, however, if you keep it dangling in front of you, you might save yourself from the problems of disintegrating rubber. (I'm not sure, but the little case provided might also help with durability of the wires)."
2,Worked well...when they worked,"I bought these earbuds in July (4 months ago). They were great earbuds, but almost exactly 4 months after I bought them, the right earbud quit working. No sound comes out of the right earbud at all. I was very disappointed. I take care of my equipment, and the cords were not pulled or anything."
2,Horrrible cord material,"You can read the same thing over and over again in the reviews, and here's more of the same: great sound and comfort, but the material covering the wires will literally disintegrate even with just moderate use within a couple months. I wish you could see all the electric tape I have on mine - not worth the hassle, folks."
2,"Great sound, terrible chord","These are great sounding headphones, and are comfortable in the ears. However, since the chord is uneven to the left (j-chord?) it has been designed to get caught in everything: your bag, door knobs, and your cloths. When it pops out of your left ear, it usually causes the rubber ""bud"" part to separate from the headphone. I've lost quite a few of these. When you purchase these, you're not buying headphones; you're buying a subscription to constantly purchase ear bud replacements parts. Beware!"
4,Great sound! Just make sure you have them in all the way!,"I bought these after taking back a pair of similar Panasonics. I was looking for something with a decent cord length that didn't require an extension (which is just way too cumbersome). When I first put in these Sony's, though, they sounded AWFUL- until I realized that I hadn't pushed them in all the way. I was still trying to use them like my original iPod ear buds. Once I realized that they needed to be pushed inward, they sound great! Great for bass-heavy music! But be warned- if you don't want to feel completely cut off from the world, then do not invest in headphones like this, because you will not be able to hear a single thing once the music is playing. This is how I prefer to listen to music, but it drives my husband absolutely batty- to each his/her own!"
2,"Disintegrating rubber, 3-month product life","I got these earbuds about 6 months ago to replace the junk that came with my iPod.While the sound is actually pretty good for the money, the material they use to coat the wires will completely decompose into a soft mush within a couple of months use. Mine are so bad that after 3 months, all the rubber that coated the wires connecting the two earbuds has fallen off.I've never had a more comfortable earbud, but I wouldn't ever buy these again unless I could afford to replace them every three months."
1,Beware: The cord WILL disintegrate within weeks,"Nothing to complain about with the sound or general design. However, the material used for the cord is completely inappropriate. As said in this space before:The cord will not last through the first two months of use. This is a serious flaw that Sony sure knows about by now. Unbelievable, but the consistence of the cord material is most reminiscent of Play Doh!"
1,shame SONY,the sheathing covering the wires disintegrated where there was contact with the skin... the sound is ok but come on just two months the covering is dead.
1,A disappointment,"I bought the EX51LP and was pleased with the sound quality and found the earplugs quite comfortable. The plugs did a good job blocking outside sound. But within a month, the sheathing covering the wires disintegrated where there was contact with the skin. I then bought the more expensive EX71SL and the same sheath on the wires began to disintegrate. I expect better from SONY."
3,Pretty good,The headphones are great. I used them with my iPod. The cord is a little long and gets in the way. Maybe having a clip attached to the cord so I can hook it on my shirt during workouts. Other than that great product.
1,Who stole my base?,"Nice looking, light weight, but to cheep. Went back to my old headphones becuase these take the quality right out of listing to music."
2,Did not meet expectations,"I bought these for their touted sound quality and noise canceling ability. Befroe using these I had Sony's MDR G72 (which I prefer). Just as is the case when buying speakers, it only makes sense that a small headphone will not produce the same range of sound as a larger pair. Bass response is minimal, unlike what some other reviewers have stated.Indeed, these are comfortable and cancel out exterior noise, but sound quality is sacrificed. Quite dissapointing. I'm either going to buy another pair of the MDRs or perhaps a Sennheiser."
2,Not very good,"These are disappointing. They do block a *little* bit of noise, and they are *adequate* earphones, but the original iPod earphones sound better - they have deeper, more well-defined bass.If you have an iPod, and you want noise-canceling earplug-type earphones, these might be sorta okay, maybe...but I have no idea why everyone's raving about them in the other reviews."
3,"It'll do, but no big deal.","First of all, you get adequate sound; about what can be expected from something like this.The cord is ridiculous- five inches on the left, eighteen on the right. Plenty of slack to get caught on things, unless you wear it over your back as Sony tells you to.The ear buds stay in pretty well, but take care of them because you only get one pair in each size and they're fragile. They don't block out much noise, but better than typical headphones. The outside world is muffled, but you'll hear that bus loud and clear before it hits you. I guess that could be considered a positive.If you really want to block out the outside world, try Koss' The Plug and modify it. Go to the drugstore and buy earplugs, drill a hole through the middle, cut them down to the right length and fit over each shaft. This is as tricky as it sounds, but truly effective. The Sonys don't lend themselves to this kind of modification."
1,Garbage!,"Purchased these in hope of bettering my new iPod earphones only to discover the sound to be tinny, weak, and seriously lacking bottom. The winding case included is nothing more than a cheap plastic tube that constantly comes undone and will eventually go into the garbage along with these headphones.One positive however, they give different sizes of earpieces so the fit was exceptional, but to me earphones aren't a fashion statement, they are equipment to enjoy my music. CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
2,What bass!,It's a total waste of monies. This ear plug is flimsy and sound quality is aweful for the price you paid. Bass is nil and treble feeblish. Who ever gave it a full 5 stars need to check out with other mades before so generously awarding this garbage 5 stars.
4,great deal.,For the price these headphones pack a punch. They block out almost all exterior sound and have a nice small profile. I would totally recommend this product.
4,Pretty good,"I like these earbuds. It took some time to get used to the way the fit in the ear, but i love the way they kill a lot of background noise. The only thing im worried about in these earbuds is how long they will last. I've had my pair about 2 months and already im seeing the caseing on the wires start to deteriate near the earbuds themselves."
3,Ok Headphone.,"These are `ok' only headphones, a bit overpriced for the quality and construction. I can't understand why the cord is not symmetrical. It always falls from my ears when working out (mainly the left one that is closer to the hanging cord and even when using the biggest plastic adaptor), which is annoying. The design of the case is also pretty bad and useless as it does not provide protection for the cord. The headphones provide some blockage of surrounding noise as it comes with 3 pairs of soft plastic adaptors to fit the size of your ears. It is not as uncomfortable as headphones that enter into the ear canal, which is nice."
3,"Great sound, but...","The headphones produced nice sound and fit nicely in the ear. However my left earphone died after about to weeks of use. I sent them back, but haven't received the new ones yet. They're a good buy at a good price though."
3,"Fit well, poor sound.",I didn't even have to compare these head phones to another pair to know that I was listening to sub-par sound quality. It was imediately evident. That upset me because they fit so well. There's a chance I have a bad pair but I'm just going to return them.
2,Not a good buy!,"The Sony Fontopia Headphones have great sound quality and they basically block out any noise (which is nice on a flight with screaming babies). However, the rubber attachments fall off really easily and I've already lost two. The headphones come with a case to hold the rubber attachments, but it pops open all the time. The cord is way too long if you're just walking around town listening to your mp3 player. I would recommend buying a different set of headphones. I'm not very happy with these."
3,Somewhat deceiving,"I looked at the COLEMAN photos and it sure looked like some growly large bluesman with a STRAT. I was somewhat dissapointed when the thing started. The voice is more falsetto than growl and the guitar playing was also light and fluffy. I must have missed THE NASTY RIFFS that the reviewer mentioned, because they sure are not on this cd. This is a passable funk cd, but it only rarely strays into BLUES and stays right away from any ROCKING. If funky soul is your flavour, I guess this one is for you. I'm more into BLUES / ROCK and this is certainly not that."
3,Caution: Two different versions of this tape,"There's a bit of confusion about this tape because it was re-released in 2001, and the new version omits some of the clips in the 1996 version. (Who knows why?)For example, I bought this tape from an Amazon seller, and it was missing the Sam Kinison ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" clip, and also missing the Julio Iglesias clip with Johnny playing Willie Nelson. Turns out I had bought the re-released version. So then I bought it again from another seller who had the original version, and all the clips are there.If you want to make sure to get the complete (original) release of this tape, ask the seller to confirm that the front cover has Johnny wearing a light blue jacket, and not a tan jacket (which the re-released edited version has)."
4,looking for an echo,Saw the group live in Pittsburg Pa. and just had to find a CD. LOOKING FOR AN ECHO will make you feel like a kid again on a summers night in the city.
4,great listening music,"I also ordered the movie that went with this soundtrak but never got it. The soundtrak is great, now I'm going to reorder the movie again so I could see what I've been enjoying listening too. I absolutely love Kenny Vance."
5,extremely helpful,"using an earlier edition of this book, my husband and I built a three bedroom one bath addition to our home. I didn't know one end of a hammer from the other but the book was so clear in it's descriptions and illustrations that the project was completed beautifully. Just had to have the updated version for my use and to pass to the kids."
4,Very good!,"This do-it-yourself book is very good. It is an excellent resource for the homeowner with some to many handyman skills. My first complaint is that several projects are way beyond the capacity of the weekend home-warrior. Secondly, many of the instructions are not detailed enough. You are forced to figure out internal steps to procedures on your own. I have the original 1973 edition, and its new look and upgrade is amazing. It is a book I wouldn't do without."
4,Nice book,"its a nice well-rounded general know-how-to book. It doesn't get too deep into any one particular project, yet the info is good.Some of the graphics look a bit dated despite the claim of it being recently revised. I suppose all is well though, how much does plumbing change over the years? Hammering a nail is still hammering a nail.i've enjoyed this book and plan on using it as a main point of reference for future household projects.UPDATE: OK, so a wood flooring project came up and I was a bit stuck mid-project. Then I remembered I had this great book. A few flips of the pages, look at a few pictures, read a bit... and voila! I became unstuck and masterfully completed the floor I was working on."
4,Good,"This product arrived a bit roughed up ... the binding was broken when I received it. I think it must have happened during shipping because the outside of the package was a bit torn up as well. Otherwise, everything was great! It arrived in good time. Thank you."
5,Ecellent,"My husbsnd thinks this book is fantastic,a lot of pointers for the do it yourself person.And delivery was excellent, i received it sooner than i expected."
1,Readers Digest Fix it book too old,"New Fix-It-Yourself Manual: How to Repair, Clean, and Maintain Anything and Everything In and Around Your HomeThis book is out of date .It does not even have front loading washers and the computer is in a land fill most likely. What it does have is well done , but this book needs to be updated.Don"
5,Awesome book!,I love these books by Reader's Digest. I appreciated that this item shipped quickly and arrived in awesome shape. Very handy book to have around.
4,great 8 year and under gift!,"the only issue I had there where no real instructions on how to introduce the ants in the and farm, and it's not as easy as you think, once you pour them in they all run for the hills trying to get out, gotta be careful not to spill the beans and have ants running all over you floors. Same issues when trying to get the dead ants out. other than that my 6 year old loves it."
3,great fun for a week,"It is great fun for a week, but, inevitably, the ants die. Of course, nobody doubts this will happen, but it does get a bit disconcerting, having this blue gel ant coffin sitting around. The instructions say that the ants will carry dead ones to the top and they can be tweezed out. No luck with that for our ants. They left the dead ones in the tunnels, and the whole thing will have to be trashed.We also had a bit of trouble with the foam that seals the lid on. The ants bit some pieces off and made it difficult to close.Still though, watching ants dig tunnels is incredibly fun, and this does the trick.PARENT TIP: You can order the ants online at the website for the toy, perhaps when you order the farm, and then the kiddies won't have to wait as long to have ants."
3,used merchandise,"all the parts were not even there and after we put the ants in, they got out from a crack in the plastic. this item must have been returned and not checked before it was reshipped. have never had any problems with items from amazon before but this was ridiculous."
3,Cool but can only use once.,The gel is a cool feature but my son was disappointed when the first colony died. It really is just a one time use kind of product.
4,Ants last a long time,"My son loved watching the ants build tunnels. The instruction booklet said the ants would only last 2-3 weeks, but ours lasted for 4-6. Perfect for curious preschoolers."
4,Great Fun,"I received this ant farm as a gift last May. I ordered the ants and they arrived within one week and only one was dead. I really enjoyed watching the ants tunnel, develop shifts, select their dormitory and mortuary. All that took only two weeks and then they were satisfied with their efforts and stopped working. I caved in one of the tunnels to see what they would do...they started working again. But, they were also starting to die...about one every other day...so I set them free to die in a natural environment. As I said they are great to watch but without a queen don't expect them to last very long. That in itself is a great learning experience!"
5,Great ant farm!,"This really has a good sealed lid! No escapes easily made as the lid takes a little bit to open. So happy about that. I don't want a flimsy farm and this is NOT. It's very durable and sturdy. Our ants just arrived yesterday and they have already dug 3 tunnels! It's SO neat to watch them. This farm really puts the sand farms to shame. This really is a great overall product and if they offered these in bigger sizes I'd buy them! It was MUCH smaller than I thought but that's because I didn't really look at the dimensions. This farm was smaller than my household toaster. Which is nice but I think my husband was hoping to have something atleast 2-3 times the size. My kids sit at the breakfast table each morning, snatch up the farm and sit and watch it while they eat their breakfast. They claim it's like watching tv! What a great tone to that claim, right?!"
3,Started off with a BANG,We got this for Christmas and immediately the ants started tunneling. We were all fascinated with it. But it is January first and the ants have stopped tunneling and are dieing. The box said they would live 1-3 months but I did not expect them to poop out so quick. A few years ago we had a traditional sand ant farm. They did not tunnel as well and feeding them was a disaster. They died really quick. If you want a toy for a project this one is great. They really started tunneling right away. It is just not a long term toy.
4,the nephews loved it,I purchased two as gifts for my nephews (age 10 and 8). The ants arrived 2 weeks after sending for them. Both boys loved them. Actually their families are all enjoying watching the amazing tunnelers. Great gift for most kids.
1,Neat while ants are alive...they seem to starve to death,"This was really cool as the ants were frantically digging through the gel...TRYING TO FIND FOOD! They are all slowly starving to death...sad really. Gel is supposed to have 'everything they need.' Well it obviously does not.This needs to be put in a very safe place because top comes off easy and you will have ants EVERYWHERE!Sculpture?? It does look like the picture and would kinda be neat to keep but the dead ants at the bottom and throughout the tunnels detract from ""sculpture.""Would I buy it again? NO."
1,Ants died and the company sucks,"Had a really hard time dealing with Xump and Fascinations. Xump's website doesn't tell you where to get the ants, I assume there is some certificate in the box. Then you get the box and there's no certificate. Xump doesn't have anyone in their office. Fascinations answered but I think I reached the janitor because he didn't know what the heck I was talking about so I hung up. When I FINALLY got the stupid ants they were all dead except like 4 of them and they can't breed so i wasted a crap-load of money on a product neither the maker nor supplier would help me with. DON""T BUY IT!"
1,no ants until Mid March!,"I ordered this as a Christmas present for my two kids. I thought if I opened the box and got the ant order form before Xmas I would beat the crowds. However, their web site says no ants by first classUSPS mail DUE TO WEATHER until March 18th. Conveniently you can pay $ more to have them rush shipped by USPS. What BS. AND you have to PAY for the ants as well. I ordered another kit years ago where you sent away for ants but there was no extra charge. Not going to oder again and if it was easy to return I would!"
5,Classroom Ant Farm,"I've used the Antworks ant home in previous years for my classroom. The students love watching the ants tunnel! This ant home is nice for teachers because you do not have to feed and water the ants as in other farms. You will need to take out the ants as they die. Unfortunetely, unless you get a queen ant, the colony will only live for a month or two.I was disappointed this Antworks home did not come with a coupon for the ants. This will need to be purchased separetely or if you are adventurous, collect ants on your own!"
2,Ant problem ( kid review),"Well, the ants wont dig and its been a day, and i put in 20 ants but in the next hour when i checked on it, only 4 ants were left. All has escaped! The case however, is very well made and in good condition but maybe since i caught the ants myself and put them in they arent tunneling.... I will wait 24 more hours and if they dont do anything and just die, i will either A, order new ants, or plan B, trash the thing...... So far i am disappointed.. I told my mom to get this because i read all the great reviews and they pictures are so pretty too. Also, its a bit smaller than i expected. Maybe if it was a little cheaper, i wouldnt be so upset. 30 dollars is a lot of money..Not educational either. I thought it woild teach me about ants and things but, ah well."
1,Very disappointed,"The first thing you should know is that it's very small.The second issue we had is that the ants kept escaping! We would throw some in, and half an hour later, they had all escaped! We tried sealing the lid with PACKING TAPE and they still managed to get out!Our friends have the old fashioned green one with sand and it works great. We're getting one of those."
5,Exactly As Expected,Ordered and received product in timely manner. Sent in for ants which we received in a few weeks since we sent the request by mail.Ants arrived in good condition and quickly set to modifying their new home. Don't know how much else to expect.
1,waste of money,The gel was too moist. The ants started to tunnel but the next day the tunnels either filled with water or gaped open to form a cavern. Now the ants just sit there and do nothing. Very disappointing.
3,Dead ants/no response,"My son couldn't wait until his ants arrived in the mail, but to his disappointment they were all dead. I had prepared him that this might happen and he did undersand. The problem is I have been trying to contact the company by email and phone and have not had a response and was not able to get new ants. I know he would love this product, but it looks like we will never know. If I do not get a response I will return the product for a full refund."
2,"some information, not much advice","Just a quick review, for lack of time ...I borrowed this book from the library, and have been thumbing thru it, reading a chapter here and there.My impression- not worth the money if you have to pay- possibly not even worth the time. The text is mostly a tutorial on various aspects of insurance, with very little specific advice.A lot of pleasantries, few revelations. I dd not really find it that useful.A better book- get the old (1988?) Consumer Reports Guide to Life Insurance- they give ratings, specific advice.HTHScott"
2,Please be aware,"Several of the paintings in this book show naked men and women. It's a great idea, but I am shocked that they could not find more appropriate paintings for use in a children's book."
5,Old Testament's Model for New Testament's Church and Worship,"The most comprehensive study of this matter. Dr. Conner helps the theological student understand the foreshadow of the Church (Christ's Tabernacle) found in the Tabernacle of David. Both interpretations, the Davidic Kingdom and the Davidic Worship, are covered. The Davidic Worship topic study includes a deep scriptural and spiritual understanding of the Ark of the Covenant, Sion, the complete historical setting, the order of singers and musicians, evaluation of music based on principles, and more. Dr. Conner provides an exhaustive number of Bible scriptures for each concept studied. If you don't take things for granted, only those which have plenty of biblical substance, this is the kind of author you need to learn from."
2,Informational,"I had to read this book for a class on David's Tabernacle, it is very informative and biblically sound, but it is a dry read, it is very repetetive so you will get the point. It does give a clear understanding of the tabernacle of David."
1,LOUD! Blades Cannot be Replaced; Burned Out,"My husband makes himself a smoothie almost daily. Due to heart condition, this is healthy way to start each day -- so, was thrilled he was comfortable with this machine. Previous Back to Basics model was discontinued by Manufacturer. SM600 Price is reasonable, but WARNING: Unit is LOUDER with GLASS JAR -- not quieter, as manufacturer states. (Dishwashing glass jar is a plus, though. Former model, could take ALL pieces apart to clean/replace. This model, they moulded blades ONTO grey plastic base = Not good for cleaning & can't replace blades! Changes were cheaper for manufacturer; more expensive for Consumer.) Sadly, CANNOT recommend SM600: LOUD, BLADES cannot be properly cleaned or replaced + burned out in one year. Last unit lasted SIX (6) Years of almost daily use. Hope this helps you find unit best for your family. Eat well and EnJOY the journey!"
1,"Cheaply made, not worth the money! Buyer Beware!!","I bought this machine and made 4 batches of smoothies in a 2 week period and the motor died. I thought maybe I did something wrong, so I bought another and tried again...read all directions carefully, followed them to the ""t""...died after only two batches. I was so disappointed, my kids and I LOVE making smoothies and loved the serving spout, so we returned it again, hoping maybe we could ""baby"" this one for a longer life. 3 batches. I give up. My $5 blender I got from Walgreens does better than this...we just liked the novelty of the serving spout. Do not buy, it is a complete piece of junk!!"
1,Can't imagine it only runs for 3 times...,"I can't believe that this product only runs 3 times, then the motor with spinning parts and blades are broken (besides the blades, all is plastic made). Noise is also unacceptable compare to Magic Bullet. I bought this because the container of Magic Bullet are too small, and I was going to make baby food for my daughter.Don't buy this product, you would definately disappointed."
1,lacks lyrics,"I already purchased this CD from iTunes, but really wanted to be able to read the song lyrics. This CD is advertised as containing lyrics, which it does but only for a couple songs. I was disappointed because now I have purchased the CD twice, and still don't have the lyrics..."
4,Great DVD for over 50.,"I think this is a great DVD, but I wish there had been an index so I could go to each exercise depending uppon what I wanted to do that day. Now I have to watch the whole thing and write down when each exercise occurs so I can skip around. Other than that, it's well worth it."
3,Nothing special,"I like the low-key approach, nice setting, but the exercises were nothing new, nothing special. I probably won't be using this DVD on a regular basis."
1,"Bad transaction, bad product!",I would never do business with this company again! They advertized that it was a pack of 2 but it was only 1. I contacted the seller and they blamed Amazon and said that they were responsible for mis-advertizing and they refused to send me the second item that was advertized. When I got the product it didn't work. They gave me a very difficult time about returning it and would not pay for return shipping which was just as much as the item.All in all this was the worst transaction I've had on Amazon. I am not blaming Amazon whatsoever as they refunded my money but I am still out the shipping cost.Don't do business with these people because they are a total ripoff!
3,FOR NOKIA ONLY!,I can't give this a good or bad rating because I failed to see it says specifically for Nokia models. So unless you have a Nokia this will not work for your phone. It's too bad it doesn't work because this is the most comfortable headset I've worn yet. I've very disappointed I can't use it.
2,OK except face rest leaves lines,"Its a decent chair for the money but has drawbacks that would keep me from buying it again. The worst is that every time someone sits up from a massage, they have deep lines on their face due to the design of the face rest and a rough seem going along it in a bad place. I don't have that problem with my other chairs (I have three). Also, the bag/case is nice in that it has wheels but the cheap plastic at the edges on the bottom breaks easily."
4,Good product for the price,"I use my chair a couple of times a month at various events. It works well indoors and out and is sturdy/stable in both environs. Lots of compliments on how comfortable it is. My only wish for this chair would be more adjusting options, but it's a good chair. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a chair for marketing purposes or who is just starting out in chair massage."
5,Great Portable Massage Chair,"I ordered this massage chair from Bookstone, the delivery arrived early as they predicted.I bought this product because of the good review here in Amazon. I used to shop online for covenient and I love Amazon, so far I don't have problem all of the products I oredered in Amazon. In short.. I like this product from MASTERS, for the following reasons: it is physically strong, lightweight, and the quality of this product is excellent and it's a good price. When I recieved the product everything was perfect but I noticed that the face craddle foam was missing. I sent them an email and they're very prompt they call and told me me that they sent a missing faccraddle foam. I'm happy with my Massage Chair. Thank you!"
5,massage chair,"I love my Master Massage Portable Massage Chair! Ordering was easy! Shipping was free! It arrived a day before the target date. It is easy to use, easy to adjust and is very lightweight. I did lots of research on chairs before I purchased this one and the weights of the various chairs vary quite a bit. This makes it very convenient. I am a very happy customer!"
3,massage chair,This is a good value. Very portable but with high weight capacity. Great for taking to fairs.
2,300 pound weight limit is not close to1000lbs,I ordered this chair based on the weight limit! This is definately false advertizment. It says 1000 lb on your web site and it says 300 lb limit on the box. Some of my clients are over 300 lbs. I am really disappointed. Also it is hard to figure out without any instructions.
3,dont get if clients are tall!!,The chair is comfortable and nice but the adjustment for height is terrible I wish I had waited or got a more exspensive chair to be honest. Its your choice though.
1,Not even worth one star!,"Ordered this as a professional massage chair, but it was clearly not. It is poorly manufactured, the frame was bent, the seat and headrest were stuck in one position, and I couldn't even fold it back down to return it. Very poor quality, reeks of chemical vinyl fumes. Very disappointing! I wouldn't even recommend it for home use, as it won't change positions and cannot be put back in the carrying case once it is set up."
3,Solid chair,"This is a very well constructed chair. It is not as adjustable as some I have used and might be too small for some of the larger office workers I have met. The case is well made but adds considerable heft to the package. The price was excellent! I would buy this chair again, especially if cost were a factor!"
4,"Light weight, easy to setup",This chair is easy to setup and has adjustments sufficient for chair massages. Very easy to cart around with the wheeled carrying care and light weight. My clients do prefer to use the massage table for a more comfortable and thorough medical massage therapy.
1,Where is Rita MacNeil,"I was about to order the CD's and thought I had better check out which artists were performing on the CD's - and much to my surprise the most famous Nova Scotian - Rita MacNeil is not on the CD's - what happened. I love Cape Breton Music, celtic music etc but can't believe that Rita MacNeil does not appear on the CD's."
3,this is STONEWARE,"Nice color. VERY HEAVY. Cleans easily. This is not the ceramic of Corningware. It is Stoneware, which means it will break easily if bumped or dropped."
2,inside sticker/glue,"Pretty dish, lovey color & perfect price... But inside of dish was stickerthat covered the whole bottem which will not come off. It took 24 hours for paper(soaking in warm water with soap) to loosen it but now thick sticky glue will not come off. I have been scaping it with a knife. Now will see what happens. I hope it doesn't get all scratched up."
5,Excellent Language Guide For Maple,"This is an excellent book. It is similar to a language guide for a standard programming language. All of the language constructs are covered. It is not a bunch of very simple examples constructed for an undergraduate math, engineering, or physics class. If you do anything serious with Maple, this book will be very useful for you. I have found no other similar books."
3,good starter but not for older babies,This would be a good first book for +/- 3 months but there is not much to keep the attention of a one year old.
2,Not as good as Colors but good,I have to say it isn't as good as her other book colors. It is a bit difficult for a baby who is learning peek a boo b/c it's not the same baby who is hiding on the next page. Having said this a few months ago... My daughter now LOVES this book. She gets it so that's all that matters.
5,"Humor, History and superb english","This book is one of the very best I have read in recent times. The book marries Indian mythology with the freedom struggle and recent polity. Filled with humor and sarcasm, the author tells both stories very successfully and also chips in with his subtle observations (especially about independence and after). And to top it all the English is very good. If you don't know much about Indian history, and appreciate good english, you should read it."
2,Nice sound but terrible fit,I am searching online for a replacement of these phones. They are uncomfortable and feel like they'll slide off my ears at any minute. I've tried for a year to use these things. What a waste of money. They just feel awful.
1,hard to get to fit right,"These wouldn't even stay on without bending the spring wire. Unfortunatly, the wire is a flat spring steel, and you cannot just bend it without it distorting somewhere else. I spent over an hour trying to find the right way to bend the wire to keep them from just falling off. I got one configuration to work, but only if I did not move my head. They are very lightweight, or at least seem so, since they are usually falling off. I can not attest to the sound quality, as I never got so far as to plug them in. If you buy these, definitely buy a couple of pairs of pliers to assist in the custom fit. You will look really cool with these, no doubt, as you are cruising down the boulevard, constantly fidgeting with them, trying to keep them on your ears. $45 down the toilet."
5,Great headphones!,"I use them for running and other exercise with an MP3 player. I've been through dozens of different styles, all with comfort, quality or usability issues. These are absolutely comfortable, stay in place without applying pressure and have good sound quality."
4,Comfortable small headphones,"These little headphones are the ones I always take on the road with me. They are comforatable to wear, have good quaility sound and are small and light to carry."
5,Child's Racing Suit,I ordered this as a halloween costume. The price was very reasonable and the quality is good. This is a well made racing suit for pretend play. My son loves it and it will see a lot of use past halloween.
3,Disapointing,"This is my least favorite of all the Circuit Session cd's released. About 3 or 4 of the tracks are really just boring, looped beats over and over and over... put me to sleep. Abel's mixing is Ok, not the best, but its alright. He shoulda selected better tracks, that would've worked better together. it has a few exclusive remixes on there, which makes it worth the $$ i spent, but dont expect anything amazing."
2,good watch but,"I just bought a Smith & Wesson Men's SWW-357-BSS Commander Tritium H3 Black Stainless Steel Strap Watch and I'm having some troubles with it.The Hour hands is not synchronized with the minutes' hand. When it's 12:00 o' clock for the minutes hand, it's not 12 o'clock for the hours hand. the bezel is not smooth at all and after 2 weeks of normal use...it's now locked... I'm returning i to have it fixed. not worth it. sorry"
2,Does not live up to Smith & Wesson name,"This watch is nice to look at, but after two weeks of wear the crystal is chipped, either because it is seated improperly or designed badly. The edge of the crystal sticks up above the watch case and is not beveled, causing the edge to chip. In addition, you can easily over wind the screw down crown causing the watch to malfunction, making it hard to set hard the time. I am very disappointed and hope I will be able to get a refund."
5,Great product!,"I am a doctoral student and I purchased this to help me transcribe hours and hours of interviews myself. I spent a lot of time researching recording/transcription equipment and liked the reviews on the olympus products. This kit is very easy to use and plugs right into my laptop. I also bought the Olympus digital voice recorder (WS-310M)which has incredible memory and quality recordings, and radio shack helped me out with a telephone adapter for phone use as well. I have not done transcribing before and this made it manageable. I highly recommend it."
1,"Does not work with Mac, even though specs say it does","This product, contrary to the specs, does NOT work with a Mac. The reference manual leaves out huge chunks of what you need to know to run the software, as does the embedded ""help."" I called the Olympus support line and this is an exact quote from the ""technician"": ""Umm....... [long pause]."" If you have a Windows machine, knock yourself out, but if you have a Mac, STAY AWAY."
4,Works fine but skimpy manual,"Not bad at all. Nice solid construction, works like it should. Setup is simple, but a more detailed manual would not hurt.One snag in setup process was that you need to use the DSS Player serial number supplied in the box for the pedal to work - software itself is identical to what you probably already have installed, but you'll need to uninstall and then reinstall using new serial number. Very annoying, and documented nowhere.Also, just to keep you on our toes, the right pedal is rewind, and the left pedal is fast forward. If you're typing in Arabic or Hebrew that might seem commonsensical, but otherwise it's a-backwards. [In the next iteration of the software I imagine the little black square will mean play, the red circle will mean stop and the little black arrow will mean record.]But again, at the end of the day everything works fine. I'd buy it again."
2,doesn't / hard to work with all Olympus recorders,"I bought this for a research team, and the first person to try it out (not me) has had a lot of difficulties getting it to work with the software for the Olympus DS-30 recorder used to download audio files. After consulting with our a/v tech, it seems as if it's not going to work, which is frustrating as the recorder and kit are both made by Olympus. I should note that I haven't experienced this firsthand, but the research assistant working on it is a diligent and competent person."
1,software issue,"This product arrived and when I attmepted to install the CD that came with it, I did not have a serial number. The booklet referred me to the CD packaging, but the package was not sealed. I find this very odd and perhaps thie product was previously used even though I purchased it new????????"
5,Fast Paced Gripping Thriller,"Louise Crawford has written a wonderful, fast paced, suck you in, whirl you around, and spit you out, kind of book. I read it in one sitting, which only happens with a gripping, good novel. The characters were 3 dimensional, the by play between Art Murry and Billy Kidman flows like they are siblings. Its fun and fast to read. No slogging about in puddles of purple pros. Just good gory action with a touch of the supernatural, which is one of my favorite parts.Fortune Cookie Karma has all the things I love in a book, a bit of romance, some psychic flashes, and a sadistic serial killer that uses ice picks in a way that makes me cringe just thinking about it! My feet are very sensitive and my imagination had my toes curled with feet tucked away from any threat.There is humor, solid relationships, lively secondary characters and enough drama to satisfy any ""hard core"" police procedural reader.Buy it, read it, you will enjoy it!5 plus stars"
2,Exhumed...for what reason?,"I hate giving Clement a bad review, but this one was a let-down. The only installment of the three vignettes I enjoyed was the final one that involved werewolves/vampires/and zombies. If the entire movie had this kind of hook, I would've enjoyed it as much as the Meat Market movies and Binge and Purge which are excellent films.It was the confusing, purposefully vague ending that made me dislike this movie so much. I do look forward to his next film, this one is just okay, but nothing to write home about."
4,Nikon User's Guide to Bird Photography,"Similar in scope to Art Morris's book, but by a Nikon user. Of course, neither _really_ depends upon using a Nikon or Canon, essnetially the same lenses are available from both manufacturers. The techniqe is the thing. But here they differ somewhat as well. Art Morris likes to 'stalk' birds; Chris Gomersall prefers a hide (blind). Perhaps both methods should be studied!"
4,Typical Indiana Jones Adventure,"Reviewers opted to ""diss"" this movie but I thought it was excellent, exactly what a person should expect from an Indiana Jones adventure. The fact that Harrison Ford still performed most of his own stunts is amazing. And they all looked like they were having a good time doing it. Far-fetched? Sure, but aren't all of the Indiana Jones movies the same? Interesting? Absolutely. There was a lot of tongue-in-cheek scenes and dialogue if you paid attention. The only downside is that, realistically, this is probably going to be the last Indiana Jones movie."
3,Too Expensive,"I just finished applying this screen protector and was a little disappointed. First off, only one protector came in the package, which makes this one very expensive strip of plastic. I carefully followed the directions and never touched the sticky side with anything, but noticeable specks of dust still managed to cling right to it before I could apply it. Now there are distracting little ""fuzzies"" on the screen that I can see whether the Zen is on or off. Washing the protector per the instructions didn't make things any better.On the positive side, the protector wouldn't be very noticeable if the fuzz wasn't stuck on it and it feels fairly rigid. I'll keep trying to find a way to remove the dust, but I still feel that the price is way too high for a single protector."
4,Good,"I bought this CD after being satisified enough by ""Turn it up"" Volume 1. Volume 2 concentrates less on hardhouse and goes all out on house with a club like feel to it. It's the better choice out of Volume 1 and 2 if you like house more. Pick it up if you want a nicely mixed house CD with a little bit of club sprinkled on."
3,Could have been better,"Marie Ewing has a magnificant voice. Her expressions were great. However, sexy or sensuous she wasn't. This performance would be excellant for family viewing, but I don't think in necessarily portrayed the sensuous gypsy girl."
4,Dakota Fanning Makes the Picture!,"Without a doubt, young actress Dakota Fanning is what makes this movie work. The story is pretty much your basic run of the mill feel good story about a horse and a girl, but Dakota makes it come alive. Truly she is one of the most talented young actresses there is and ever has been maybe! This movie moved me to tears and yes it is a little slow at points, but overall is a great movie for the whole family!It encourages me to keep on dreaming!"
5,"Dreamer, a movie for everyone!",I saw a preview of this movie on another one I had purchased. Was delighted to find it at Amazon.com. I loved the movie. Had company with kids fro 7 to 13 and also Dad got hooked into watching it with the kids. All loved it. The 7 year old asked if I had any more great movies! Audiance: ALL
5,Dakota Fanning is such a cutie pie and... I want a horse!,"Its really a fantastic movie. It really made me love horses and iam going to get one soon. Great actors.I loved the first song which comes when the cast appears in the end , its called dreamer by Bethany Dillon."
1,Disappointed w/ vendor,"The previously-viewed Dreamer VHS tape arrived unwound and would not rewind. I returned it and Amazon promptly refunded my money. I am disappointed with the vendor for not having taken the time and care to ensure the tape was usable prior to sending it out. I went with the vendor as it was backed by Amazon, and Amazon proved itself. However I cannot say the same for the vendor J and L Superstore."
5,Review of Dreamers,"I really loved this movie. If you liked Seabiscuit this is a movie you're sure to enjoy.Many times stories based upon true stories can be more interesting than fiction. I loved the reality that showed discouragement, loneliness, doubt and yet at the same time hope, courage, winning against all odds on several fronts and the belief and empowering of one's child.Great story that leaves you feeling good afterwards."
5,dreamer,it was a real good family movie and really enjoyed it would recomend it to anyone who likes horses or just good family movie
5,Dream Movie,"This film was so much better than I hoped it to be. Really great character actors. Kristopherson and Russell actually looked like they could be father and son. Dakota Fanning is the star. Great, great acting."
5,You'll love this movie:),What a wonderful surprise when I let my granddaughters (ages 6 & 9) watch this movie. They hardly moved the entire movie. That is until the end!! And they were on their feet cheering!! Great family movie. No foul language or gore:) Just a wonderful little movie:) Highly recommend this one:)
4,Dreamer,"A feel good movie. The area you see in the picture is outside Lexington, KY, an area I am familiar with from living there and driving the road where the rock walls have stood for over a century. I've not lived in the area for 40 years so watching the movie brings back memories. Even if you have never been in KY it's still a good movie"
4,Great kid movie!,"This is a great family movie about faith, love, and hope. Our entire family loves it!"
5,A Book Guide by My Spiritual Guides,"This is a book truely guided by my spiritual guides. Incidentally, i had a dream the previous night. When i was at the book store i felt a strong presence which led me to Loving Solutions. I was overwhelmed by joy and tears flow freely when i read the book. I sincerely recommend it to every married couple."
2,Good Storyline; Stilted Dialogue and Narrative Voice,"The storyline of this book was very clever. Indeed, it was brilliant. I was disappointed that the writing itself was not on a very high level. There was nothing wrong at all with the spelling, punctuation or the way the paragraphs were put together. The book has a good opening, middle and closing. Lots of exciting things happen. Unfortunately, the dialogue was very stilted and the relationships between some of the characters seemed sappy and unreal. People just don't talk like that in real life. The narrative voice also sounded stilted. I think this book had the potential to be great, even fantastic, but it fell flat. Perhaps this is because it's a first novel. I think the author should study as much as possible about the craft of writing and try her hand again."
2,Disappointing,"My book group in San Francisco was excited about this book but upon reading it was pretty disappointed - and we rarely all agree. Myself, I thought the book was an inconsistent rant. In one paragraph the author muses about being a speechwriter for an admired politician but when he calls her a ""foreigner"" in Iran, she writes a contradictory multi-page temper tantrum about how horrible he is. It is difficult to connect with an author whose own beliefs seemed so subject to mood change and immaturity."
5,Identity in Motion,"This book relays the complex reality of a woman that holds multiple identities. Ms Moaveni is able to give a portrayal of Iranian youth becuase she is an Iranian woman, and it is understood to an English-reading audience because she is also an American woman. Given her age group and status as an Iranian-American journalist in Tehran she sheds light to a particular group of young Iranians that we would otherwise not know. I welcome and recommend this book at a time when Iran and the region remain misinterpreted and misunderstood."
5,Superb insider look at what led to the recent election uproar in Iran,"As a Persian-speaking American who learned Persian in college and spent nine months in pre-revolutionary Iran, and am now married to an Iranian, I found Moaveni's book rang true on so many levels...it's the best take I've seen so far on the Iranian diaspora experience in the US, while her descriptions of life as an Iranian-American in Teheran are vivid and brilliantly crafted. So much of the heroism, tragedy and extraordinary cultural contrasts in Iran that we have witnessed on television and the Internet in recent months (2009) takes on whole new dimensions and a great deal more clarity with Moaveni's lucid revelations. I can't wait to read HONEYMOON IN TEHRAN."
5,A life worth reading about. . . . . . .,"Azadeh provides a great portrayal of her life in the US and Iran. She shares her experience with her relatives in Iran, immediate family members, friends, and co-workers. The political climate changes that she went through as a journalist in Iran. Pg 117 illustrates how dangerous it was for her to be a journalist by occupation while being in Iran. I liked how she identified with both countries. Overall, it is a great book and it provided a glimspe of how some Iranians lived in Iran during her stay there."
2,"I wanted to like this book, I really did","After the first 50 pages, i could not get into this book -- and I really tried. Her story and character did not elicit sympathy from me & the writing style did not engage me. It took effort to get through it. I am familiar with life in Iran which I thought would have made me admire the book & the author all the more, but it fell flat, and I am not exactly sure why. It's a great title & in theory, an important story for our time, but the way in which it was told did not do it for me. This is just my personal, unscientific opinion. I am sure others will enjoy it & feel quite differently."
2,vividly forgettable,"I have no business writing this review, for I read Moaveni's ""Lipstick Jihad"" over eight months ago, and can recall little about it.Then why, you may ask, are you writing a review? If you can remember nothing about the characters sketched, the episodes related, the lessons learned, the style employed, etc. -- if none of these things has stuck in your mind, what could you possibly have to say about the book?My point exactly."
2,Just a Memoir,"This book is just a memoir. One should not look beyond that. If you are interested in Azadeh's opinions about Iran, you may get something out of this book. It has no social, political, or historical value based on research. It is just a young woman's struggle to deal with issues of growing up."
2,"Me, me, me again.","Memoires, in general, are little more than a stream of conscious, easy-on-the-facts opportunity to tell the world, ""Look how funny, smart, and incredibly interesting I am,"" and Lipstick Jihad adds scant little to this egomanical formula. Ms. Moaveni would have better served her readers writing a fact-based, non-fiction historical account of events or a work of fiction where the characters are at least interesting. Yawn."
2,Same Old Story,"Although this book is slightly superior to that of Afschineh Latifi (Miss ""Persian Privileged Princess"" herself!)'s book of the same genre (""After all this time: A story of...""), it is still of the same kind of bleeding heart memoir books of recent publication by Iranian so called women authors which have been sprouting like mushrooms (fungi live in the dark). This book also, like others of its kind, lacks depth, and is totally void of any vision of history: a superficial ""Remember When"" story at best.Iran needs concrete action towards Democracy right now, not reminiscence and lamentation for a fun-filled, decadent life style that only ""Persian Marie Antoinettes"" led back under the Shah.(Read my review of Latifi's book here on Amazon for more)."
1,Azadeh's Iranian Life,"The book, Lipstick Jihad by Azadeh Moaveni is a very interesting and factual book. It tells the story, in first person, about an Iranian girl living in America, and then after college, moving to Iran. But instead of feeling comfortable in her home country, she feels like an American foreigner living in Iran. While in America, Azadeh only remebers Iran vaguely, and remembers happy times there. Once she moves to Iran, she discovers the country is confused, filled with politics, and in an emotional struggle. She is a journalist and describes the difference between Iranian and American culture, such as womens' rights, and how they clash with each other. She talks about Iran's strong laws people live by, social codes, public etiquette, and the Islamic revolution that changed her country. This nonfiction book really shows the clash of the two cultures. For anyone who is interested in other countrie, thick government analysis, and how they are run, then this is a great book for that."
1,"Superficial, overly self-conscious, and repetitive","I can't believe that there are fools giving this a 5 star review. Basically, a magazine article by a better writer would have given me all I needed to know about living in Iran in the early part of the 2000s. Not only was there really very little substance here, but it's overwritten, with a bit too much attitude and a juvenile need to stuff every sentence with unnecessary modifiers (try ""impossibly young""). Then there is the arrogance of youth: ""During the week we were all frantically succeeding at our jobs - apparently the only mode of being serious people in NYC..."" Come on - I didn't think I'd be reading some pampered kid's diary. I want the last few evenings back from my friend who wanted me to read this."
3,Not what I was looking for but still worth reading,"This is not the book I was looking for--one about what 21st century Iran is like for ordinary people, an Iranian ""Bookseller of Kabul"". However, I did get some insight into the internal friction of children of immigrants who are really torn between two cultures.I had hoped someone who grew up in the United States and who recently lived for several years in Iran could convey day to day life in contemporary Iran to me. I came away learning about how difficult it must be to have feet in such different worlds, but I don't think I learned what it is like to live in Iran for most people. The average person in Ms. Moaveni's world seemed to have more money than the average American even though the per capita income in Iran is about 1/16 of that in the U.S. Knowing what a wealthy elite thinks is important since the wealthy ususally have a lot of influence, but since that is not what I was seeking, I was a little disappointed."
3,interesting and descriptive,"I found the book interesting in that it did give me a flavor of her country. I did manage to come away almost tasting the traditional foods, smell the nights, hear the language of Farsi that I do not know. I do however think, and this isn't her fault, she is young, that it was a semi shallow book based more on what the elite of Iran feel and do, and the younger ones mostly. So it was kind of like reading about the Hollywood under thirty set, in Iran. Except that in Iran everyone is political.I Personally find it odd that she could have been raised here, almost exclusively, yet at the end, find her saying it was a foreign country to her. Her description of an Iran during Sept 11th also did nothing to make me more sympathetic to the plight of her countrymen.All in all, I think she is courageous, young yes, but interesting, multilayered and will probably have a most interesting life."
4,A whole new look at the Iranian situation,"What a book! Azadeh is a very bright writer and did an excellent job of telling her story, great title too and very well chosen. This book brings a whole new dimension to Iran. While I thought most Middle Eastern people were obedient to their religion and the mullahs, government, etc., this throws that out the window. Many groups are very modern, rebel in their own ways and desire basic freedoms we all enjoy. They protest, they push the authorities, etc. After reading this, it is so clear to me that the Iranian government is not that tightly in place and the people will probably attain their freedom, as they had at one time, on their own. A very important book to read."
2,Boring,I could not get into this book and did not finish it. A very rare occurrence for me for this reader.
1,broke down the first week,"When it first arrived, I was disapointed by how small it was and how little heat it produced. The price was high that I paid for it, but I suppose it was because of the nice looks and the small amount of space it takes up. A week later, the heater quite producing heat besides a small wave on and off. It may have been caused by the non-stop use that it went through cause I probably only turned it off twice, but you'd think that (...) heater could heat a simple dorm room with ease, but this heater didn't put out enough heat. The guys in the dorm next to mine bought a heater (...) and it does twice the job this one did. (...)"
3,not all settings work right,"This heater is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but it works quite well for what I use it for. I was worried about it breaking down because of another review but I've had it for a month now and it seems to be fine. I use it to heat my bedroom and my living room, both smallish rooms. I gave it three stars because it only seems to work on the highest setting and only when it's set to oscillate. For me this isn't a problem, because I need it to run that way - my rented house is poorly insulated and it's hard to keep it warm. But beware if you think you might want to use a lower setting."
3,pretty good,"I bought this because of a review stating squirrels can't (or at least haven't on them) eat from it. I have it on a hook opposite my other bird feeder. I have not put food in the other feeder since I got this one. I noticed much fewer birds and I have yet see one eat from this feeder (we have mainly cardinals, blue jays, and sparrows + squirrels). I have seen squirrels trying to eat from it, hanging there back feet from the hook at the top of the feeder. I have noticed some food is gone from the top 2 feeder areas, whereas the bottom is still full. I think the squirrels have figured out how to eat from the top one, but I haven't had much success with birds eating from it. I have not had to refill it yet, over 1 month since I put it up."
1,Not very easy to fill,This bird feed is not what I expected. Too hard to fill and the different seeds get mixed up. Would not purchase another.
4,A good choice,"This feeder arrived on time and packaged well. It is a little smaller than I envisioned. But, I could have known that if I had looked at the dimensions provided with the description. With that said, it is plenty big enough, the birds love the assortment of seed we can provide in the different compartments. I would purchase this feeder again."
3,Not a sturdy design,Feeder is good because I can clean it and the seed doesn't get trapped to start molding.The roof sheds the rain away from the feeder holes.The feeder top cover needs to be more durable. The roof and the metal brace it hangs from are flimsy and prone to dislodging from the feeder.
2,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","I was looking for an inexpensive, but functional, bird feeder for my 8 year older bird-loving daughter. This looked like a great product. I liked the design of 3 distinct levels, but the construction was shoddy. The side seams were badly molded, leaving gaps. Also, the roof was missing altogether in my shipment. So while I like the idea of this feeder, I wasn't pleased with the actual item. I am, however, very pleased with Amazon's no-hassle return service. I guess I'll hope for better luck next time."
2,Not attractive or convenient.,This feeder was cheap feeling/looking and was a pain to fill and clean. It rained a couple of days after I filled it and within 2 days all my seed had sprouted inside the feeder and was impossible to get out. It was pretty gross. The cylindrical feeders of this type are much better.
1,Don't believe the above review.,"This DVD set does NOT contain the six disks mentioned in the above review. This set contains ONLY SUPERMAN: DOOMSDAY, JUSTICE LEAGUE: NEW FRONTIER and BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT. Each movie is a double disk and that's where the 6 disks comes from in the product description. I'm returning my set."
1,Still haven't received,Although I ordered this item approximately June 12th I still have not received it and it is now June 10th.
3,Toys R Us has it cheaper!,"I've been looking to get a set of cookware for my daughter. This one looks very nice, but after reading the reviews, particularly on the size of the set, I'm not sure this one will make it. Besides, the listed price here is outrageous, I found this same set at Toys R Us, but at a much lower price than what is listed ($11.99!)."
1,so small,This set really is useless if you want to actually put play food in the pots. The pots are just way too small.
3,Utensils break over time,"We received this as a birthday present 6 months ago. My kids use them regularly, and several handles have fallen off. I had to throw those pieces away. I also agree with other reviewers that the pots are small. My kids don't mind too much."
3,"Ok, but not great","This was given to my 3 year old 5 months ago. So far she has had a ton of fun with it. At this point, it is still in good condition. One day she will bend the utensils and then it will break. It is a great set if your child is gentle with their toys, if they are rough with their things don't get this set."
2,super small,"I passed over this toy when I saw it in person in the store. The pots are maybe 2"" or 3"" in diameter max! I instead found a set at Walgreens that are more like 4"" or 5"" in diameter (not to mention only $4). I wanted my daughter to be able to actually fit some play food in her pots and pans to ""cook""."
3,A Little Disappointed,I was a little disappointed at the size of the cookware set. They would have been perfect if they were larger. All the play food that you buy are too large to fit in the pots and pans. I guess you could use them to pretend feed your dolls but they are really too small to put anything inside of them. We bought the kitchen set from pottery barn last year and bought all the pots and utensils they had and I was hoping they were like theirs in size. She loves the pottery barn ones and I was just trying to find her more but it didn't work out with these....they aren't much fun to play with when you can't put any play food in them.
1,Way too small,"I felt like this set was way too small. I wanted something a little bigger. I would have been looking for pieces all over my house, I took it back to Toy's R Us"
3,Tiny Pots and Pans,"My daughter received these for Christmas last year. They are very cute and are so strong. We have not had any problems with durability. However if you have the Fisher Price or Little Tikes food these pots, pans, and utensils are too small. My daughter has the Little Tikes shopping cart. She uses thes pots, pans, and utensils all the time with the shopping cart, but never to pretend cook. They would be great for cooking if you have mini play food!"
5,Great,My 2 year old daughter had a set of plastic pans and the handles kept breaking off. I got these for her a couple of months ago and she absolutly loves them. The are very durable and she loves playing with them more than the plastic because of the sound they make. They are like real pots and pans only smaller. They are kind of small but she doesn't mind and she can still fit some of her play food in them.
1,Not Like Home Cookware Set,"This is a terrible toy! My 19 month old is always getting into our pots and pans, so we thought it would be nice to get him his own set of metal pots and pans. The set is very small, I could fit each piece in the palm of my hand easily. The pieces also break easily and 2 of the utensils were broken in the first 3 hours of Christmas morning. A comlete let down. It is funny that I got the e mail today to fill out this review because I just threw the rest of the set out this morning and I am counting it as a loss. My reccomendation, spend the 20 bucks on life size pans at the dollar store, thats what the kids really want to play with anyway, and they will last longer."
1,Music CD Recorder 3.0,This software does not work on Windows XP as it was advertised. Having purchased it I have discovered that there are a number of 'patches' and 'fixes' at their website. The tech support is virtually non-existant. I have only received a one sentence reply to my problems in the past 2 weeks since I have received this turkey.
2,Data Becker Music CD Recorder,"I am giving this product two stars (one more than any of the other reviewers), only because I had some luck with it while running on my old Windows 98 system. I was able to copy songs from cassette tape to .wav format and do some wav editing with them. But it was slow and tended to crash fairly often. When I installed it on my XP sytem it crashed 100% of the time. Therefore it is not something I use very often, and I would not recommend it to anyone else. I'm sure that there must be better products on the market."
5,Reputable Company,The item was shipped right away and it was short half of the purchased amount. I emailed the company and they immediatley answered and applogized and sent the rest out asap. They were a pleasure to do buisness with. This is not my first time. I highly recommend.
5,A memory from my childhood,"This was one of my favorite books as a child, and I was delighted to find it to send on to my kids and their kids. A story -- written in 1904 -- of young girls making their own decisions and ""living"" in Dandelion Cottage for a summer was inspiring then and even more now with an adult's understanding of history."
2,English Yiddish dictionary,This book didn't help me much. I reallyneeded one with transliterations; thisdidn't have it. My error in ordering.I should have specified the need fortransliteration.
4,My Aunt Laura makes me proud,"I enjoyed this book, not just because I am her Nephew, but I waited for a long time for her to publish this book, I was treated to an early preview in her home in 1987 when she read her excerpt to me. Laura is descriptive about what she writes, and the story was really good. The only reason why I didn't give the story 5 stars which the story deserves 5, but there was a little language content that didn't really fit, but it had history to the pioneers. Thank you Aunt Laura for giving me hope for my dream book to be published. I loved it! Thanks for the Christmas present, I will charish it forever! -JM"
5,Whoever thought grammar could be ***fun***?,"This book is a horse of another color. Forget about clever and witty inside jokes only the enlightened can understand (which so many books about writing are like), or the overbearing boredom of rule after rule and feather-light distinction after distinction.This book's got *soul*. And heart. And, as it should, lots of good stuff to help you make better choices in writing.Just because a lot of famous, powerful and successful people these days come across like blithering idiots does not mean that you will be successful as a writer (or in life) with slipshod grammer and slapstick English. For a lot of us, the problem is, and always has been, how do you get the rules and the mindset without wishing you were getting a root canal instead?The Gremlins of Grammar is your answer. You'll enjoy it. And, you'll learn a lot.David GarfinkelFounder, World Copywriting Institutewww.copynewsletter.com"
3,getting better,"As far as mysteries are concerned I expect genre loving readers will still find this second episode at fault. The very classical rules of very classical detective stories require that the readers be given all necessary inditia to solve it for themselves.It does not happen here and the identity of the murderer is entirely unexpected.As for the rest I was happier than with the first book: this series is apparently not meant to be more than just entertaining and entertaining it is.The writing is quick, light hearted; there are repetitions and redundant statements but fewer than in the first episode not to mention that Simon is much more likeable here than it was there.An easy read for a lazy afternoon: this book is nothing more but also nothing less than this."
3,Those pills...,"Has no one but me noticed that on page thirteen of the first book, Simon explains that he must take the pills twice a day? And then throughout this second book, he takes them three times a day?What's up with that?"
1,Hello support?,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
1,pathetic = I'd give a 0 if i could,"The range is okay. The gun is weighed down with a random metal blcok in the clip. The gun doesn't come with istructions and the ""scope"" is a plastic bullseye that won't stay in place. it is cheap plastic. I must get a new gun because this one broke. I've had it for a week and it broke. It fell 3 feet, slowly, off my bed onto a platic-tile floor. It broke into a ton of pieces. This gun sucks"
3,May not work with all equipment.,"This cable does not work with all equipment and it did not work with mine. The ground, left, right and video may not be in the same location as the equipment you are trying to use it with. The connection wobbled slightly. The cable appears well made and sturdy."
5,Absolutely charming,"Mr. Roach writes with a most refreshing and unique style. Anyone who appreciates people who don't mince words will delight in Clyde's, ""Confessions of an Airline Pilot."" Watch out though, no matter what your life experiences entail, this book will no doubt entice you to write your own book of memoirs."
2,Am I The Only One that Knows the Problem,"Captain Roach is undoubtedly an experienced pilot but his reminiscences of a lifetime of events wears a bit thin when time after time he is the only one to identify and solve a problem only to have the company or aircraft builder ""do nothing about it"". There seems to be hundreds of such events."
3,Debut from the Son,"Here comes Phil Collin's son onto the music scene. Did anyone even know Phil had anyone else in the music business? Probably, if you live overseas, but here in the States, highly unlikely. This is a good debut from Simon even though it borders on the electronic side of things. While Simon plays drums it is pretty interesting that he uses the drum programmable approach. But, maybe other people were steering him in that direction for this first album. So, if you like pop and electronica this will be a great listen. If you're expecting Phil Jr. to burst out at you, forget it. This is nothing like his father's music. Good first effort though. A hard album to find, if not impossible here in the states. You will have to find it used through Amazon or download it via ITunes."
3,Experience Of Using Norelco 8140 XL,"I've been using Norelco's shaver for about 4 month, and it seems to weak. I had a Hitachi that had a single moving unit with blade under one foil. from the late 80s, and it had more power than this 8140XL. I though it would be speedy, but in fact it misses a few stubble here and there. It works very gently. Shaving goes much faster with the old skool double bladed razor. So much for my high expectation. I paid $77, but I could have just gotten top of the line the Panasonic for $50, and it would probably have done a better job."
3,You'd better be a Mastroianni fan,"If you enjoyed MM's work, there is no better film than this, with extended monologues by MM intercut with scenes from his films. (The stories about the one he made with his brother were really cool). Lots of talk about his contemporaries, but the best parts are his musings on life and art; you really wish you could have known him as a person. On the down side, it is pretty long and the subtitles are often washed out during the b/w sequences. I watched over two nights."
2,2.5mm Jack beware!!!,make sure you buy a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter if you buy this.Witout and adapter this will not work with anything that has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack.
5,Works Great!,"Works great with my wife's older Verizon LG phone as well as my Casio Gz1. Earpiece is sloppy but very comfortable for all around fit, and it stays in place readily. Transmission is great both ways and - added bonus - the mic minimizes wind noise.Wires look a little flimsy, but that's inherent in this type of product. Very happy with price and product."
1,Useless microphone,"The earpiece is very comfortable and the sound is good for a cheap headset, but the microphone is unusably bad. I tried it in multiple devices and nobody could clearly understand what I was saying. Voice activated controls on multiple devices simply did not work."
2,"Low Price Point, Average Performance","The Sony DR-J115 mobile headset is an average performer for the price point. Over the years, Sony's high standard build quality can lead consumers to expect too much, even when it comes to a lower priced cellphone headset. The combo of my Motorola phone and this unit produces less than acceptable earpiece volume and microphone sensitivity. In spite of the low price, I would not recommend this headset for anything but a very quiet environment. Sorry Sony."
3,good for price,"The item is good for its price, but not sure why the ear hook is much larger than my ear so it's not very comfortable."
3,not bad for the price,"The sound quality is OK - it sounds a little muffled, but good enough to carry on a conversation if you're not in a noisy area. It's a little difficult to put on with one hand (such as while you're driving), but it fits well once it's on. All in all, it was worth the $10 I paid for it."
4,unreleased tracks great......remixes ok,"this cd is somewhat of a mixed blessing. the remixes are ok but nothing great. however it is worth getting because of the previously unreleased ""tear fool"" and ""believe"" - excellent examples of what somerville does best : danceable songs with memorable hooks and melodies. i would recommend this cd to any fans of jimmy somerville. for newcomers i would recommend ""manage the damage"" or ""dare to love"" instead."
1,A Waste of Money,"This book is a very poor guide to SimCity 3000. Many of thereferences are for events and screens that occur in the SimCity 2000edition and which are not duplicated in the 3000 game. For example, the book refers many times to specific increases in the dollar value of tiles, even though the 3000 game does not identify specific dollar values, only ranges such as ""very high"" or ""astronomical"". The book even refers to the bus station as a four tile building (which it was in the 2000 game), not a one tile building as it is in the 3000.The final insult is an entire chapter dealing with 2000 scenarios which are not included in the 3000 edition.Overall, this is a poorly edited older guide book with little work done to properly update the information for the new edition."
4,pretty good,"I've read this book twice, once when i was younger and once a few months ago... and the story sticks with you. Some really gross stuff in here, and i wouldn't recommend it to little kids even though there's lots to do with childhood in this book. A tree monster, little goblins (sort of), and an evil twin. What more could an old fashioned horror fan ask for?"
3,Doesn't work on Xbox 360,I'm still using an old PS/2 keyboard and wanted to hook it up to my Xbox 360 for typing messages (a wireless USB one works just fine on it).This adapter doesn't work at all with my 360 - I haven't tried it on a computer but have no use for it there. Another 'get what you pay for' item.
3,"Works, but no suspend support","Pros:* It works to connect my ps2 trackball to a usb port on my laptop.(the laptop trackpad/mouse driver can't handle the trackball in a PS2 port, changing the driver breaks the trackpad features)* I can plug it in and out at any time without locking up the keyboard/mouseCons:* the adapter blocks windows XP from going to sleep!- If you uncheck the correct ""Allow this device to bring the computer out of standby"" in Device Manager (or change ""USBBIOSx"" in the registry) then the computer can sleep -- but after waking, the added keyboard/mouse will be unusable until the usb is re-plugged.It does work after a hibernate/resume.* it fails to work with my ps2 kvm switch* it occasionally hiccups, occasionally the pointer and buttons stop working for a fraction of a second.* the PC sees a regular 3 button mouse, I can't use the trackball software and 4th button"
1,Doesn't work on Mac,"I received the item in question and tried to use it with my Mac. It didn't work at all, none of the keys would work. It did work on my Dell PC."
3,OK OK product,Its kinda nice but at times what happens to my keyboard is it keeps typing the same letter I last pressed and doesn't come out easily. But for the money and old technology I feel thats what we would get!Mouse works fine
2,Not very good.,"I ended up not needing this, but when testing it out, it was too loose in the USB port and would fail to connect properly."
1,Don't waste your time.,Adapter worked for two days. Worked for two more days in different USB port. Bought Dynex brand at Best Buy and have not had any trouble.
2,Its an okay product,"Was delivered in time and the price is very affordable. But I have trouble getting robust connections often, seems like some kind of a loose contact for the keybord hook up. Its hard to highly recommend."
1,This item doesn't work with my PC,"Unfortunately, this adapter does not work with my computer. It is a useless product. I threw it into trash can."
2,Looked Good on Paper But Ultimately Disappointed,when I first saw this pen I was excited after having had such good luck with Pelikan fountain pens over the years. When it was delivered it had a good solid feel but the mechanism to extend and retract the ball point was flimsy and actually jammed and broke necessitating a return to the seller.The pen line line itself isn't a strong line; weak and washed out like it's not delviering enough ink to make a thick line.One of the best writing pens I have found that is far superior to this one is the Pilot Dr. Grip ball point with medium black ink. Runs about $8 and is superior to anything I have written with recently.
2,True Names is somewhat false.,"Vinge and Al Gore apparantly have something in common, they both invented cyberspace. Outside of the pompous attitude the novella is decent. (Although he admitting cites Shockwave Runner in the preface.) The essasy by Tim May is excellent, the rest are somewhat dry. If you've never read True Names this is one way to get it."
3,Not half bad,"Well, not half, but pretty close. The matches that are good are very good though. I would recommend it, for sure."
3,A Welcome Re-Issue,"It's hard to believe that this is the work of a 20-year-old man. Victor Feldman was one of the most talented jazz musicians ever to come out of Britain. Accompanied by such excellent musicians as Phil Seamen, Derek Humble and Jimmie Deuchar, Feldman's composing, arrangements and playing are mature and confident. Not everything is of top-notch quality, Tony Crombie's 'Suite Sixteen' doesn't work that well, but all in all this is an enjoyable compilation of long-unavailable material. Listen to the opening of Feldman's big band suite -- perhaps that's where Vivian Stanshall got the idea for the Bonzo Dog Band's 'The Intro and Outro'."

5,WEILL/HUGHES TEAM=FANTASTIC POETIC MUSICAL WORK....,This is a brilliant musical by Kurt Weill with the always outstanding poetic lyrics of Langeston Hughes. Weill was on is A game when working with the theater and Hughes is in my opinion one of the most influential and brilliant poets of the 20th century. Together they make an incredible team. This work is overlooked for the most part and should be performed much more often that it is. Street Scene cuts right through to the heart of the street life. Very highly recommended if you are a fan of great musicals and fantastic poetry. Five star rating. See my other reviews if you wish.John W. Shearer
4,"Good buy, but is it worth $100 to you?","Let's not mess around - we all know that this bag would not be worth $100 if it weren't for the brand. However, as long as you remember this, then it is a bag you'd enjoy. It's a better deal than the same bag that miu miu also offers in nylon, and the military colors are funky and go with a lot of different outfits. It's also a very practical bag that doesn't require any hand or wrist. However, please note that this bag is extremely thin, which the picture doesn't necessary demonstrate. I thought it would be at least 1 - 1.5 inches thick, but it's actually a flat bag.I'm personally quite pleased with this bag, and I don't have anything of this style in my collection. I'm not sure that the $100 price tag is worth it to everyone, but like I said, as long as you're not expecting amazing luxury beyond belief then it should serve you pretty well."
5,FRANCE STYLE BARRETTES,JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.WE HAVE LACY ANNS BARRETTE COLLECTION FOR SMALL DOGS AND THE BARRETTES ARE PERFECT FOR OUR CRAFT.I WILL ALSO BE ORDERING AGAIN
5,Long-lasting scent,"I love the scent of this product. It really lasts and my German Shepherd's skin doesn't seem irritated after use. She no longer smells doggy, but like the baby she is. All 85 pounds of her."
5,Extremely useful for any business,"Harnish's book is extremely clear about the importance of core values, mission, alignment and rythym. All concepts that most of us know, but don't know how to really implement. The difference between this book and others I've read, is that it gives you well thought out tools which you can implement with confidence. It's obvious that these tools have been honed through Mr. Harnish's work with many entrepreneurs and CEOs.Pay special attention to the planning pyramid; it's helped me share the big vision and get the organization into alignment. By putting stakes in the ground, it also quickly helps to identify any holes there may be in the overall strategy.All in all, this is a must read."
2,so so,while reading books about Rockefeller i bough this one. it is not what it seems to be. Most knowledge is what dale carnegie and napolian hill provide in their books.i would not waste my time on this if i were you.
5,Attend the workshop!,"Our executive and management team read the book and attended Verne's Rockefeller Habits workshop. We have implemented everything from the book and workshop and our company has aligned itself, communicating much more effectively, and executing on goals and initiatives. I can't say enough how much the daily huddles have helped our organization break down road blocks faster than we could ever imagine. I recommend this book to anyone interested in growing your company into a 'Gazelle'. Check out Verne's website at: www.gazelles.com. I highly recommend attending the workshop."
3,Good but misleading,"Harnish covers some good points for smaller businesses and entrepreneurs but I honestly don't think he did much research on John D. Rockefeller, his methods and the Standard Oil corporation. I gained MUCH more insight into Rockefeller by reading the superbly researched and detailed biography of Rockefeller, ""Titan"", than I did reading Harnish's book. Harnish actually spends more time discussing case studies of medium to small business than he does on Rockefeller. The cynical view of Harnish is that he and the publishing company used Rockefeller's name and legend to sell the book, while actually providing little insight into the Rockefeller business system. In this instance, I'm inclined to cynicism.This is a good book for entrepreneurs, not for understanding Rockefeller, his genius or his habits. I would not recommend this to someone interested in learning more about the business system and principles of Rockefeller."
2,Simple or Simplistic,While everyone is looking for a simple book on strategy this book is excessively simplistic to the extent that it is actually misleading. The only think in it which is mildly useful is the one page strategic plan. It does not cover internal or external analysis which in my mind is the basis of strategy formulation. The book stresses braking down strategic implantation into bite size chunks which is not exactly revolutionary.
5,Great handbook for entrepreneurs!,"This is THE handbook for entrepreneurs in the high growth stage of development. How to reach new levels of growth, how to motivate your team, how to define goals and create alignment behind them, how to arrange financing.It is a workbook and if you work right through it, you will have done all it takes to make your company a fast-growth company.Helped us tremendously."
5,A Fabulous Fishing Resource,"I just finished reading this book by Tim Lilley and found it to be great. I have been ultralight fishing for several years and have been looking for a good resource on the subject. Lilley's book fulfills the needs of beginners and advanced ultralight fisherman. It answered a lot of my questions around line selection and fish specific techniques. The book is filled with full-color pics and plenty great information from rod and reel selection to saltwater techniques. I've already started creating lists of things I want to try this spring. Good job, Mr. Lilley this book is worth buying!"
3,Adult versions of fairy tales,"I purchased this book with the intention of reading original versions of fairy tales to my grandchildren. While these are beautiful written and illustrated historical documents, they are not family fairy tales by any means. Quality of the stories, illustrations and materials are lovely. Just don't expect a children's book."
5,A Pioneer,"Virtually everything written after Livermore and Wyckoff are variations on themes developed by these two men. Wyckoff was among the first to explain the accumulation-distribution cycle (which makes stock and market timing possible) and to develop the use of ""surrogates"", self-made indexes which consist of a handful of leading stocks in a group (such as semiconductors), which warn the investor of impending moves, and which enable the investor to filter out all the noise of broadcasters, publishers, newsletters, message boards, and chat rooms.Understand Wyckoff and you'll understand the engine that drives stocks and markets rather than be distracted by the genuine imitation wood trim and the smell of the leather seats."
2,You DO NOT need this book.,This is NOT the book you need about trading. This is NOT the book everybody are talking from R.D. Wyckoff. The book you need is: Trading In The Shadow Of The Smart Money by Gavin Holmes. THAT BOOK WILL SHOW YOU SOME GREAT STUFF!!
2,False description,"This wind chime specifically says it has six tubes, and that's what the illustration shows. However, I just received the one I ordered, and it has only five tubes. This might not matter to most people--it's a nice little wind chime--but if you want it for feng shui use, the number of tubes can make a critical difference. I feel gypped that a company can't even describe their own produce correctly."
4,Satisfied Customer,"This product arrived quickly and intact. I was very satisfied with the quality and pricing, and will buy it again as a gift, and for myself. The sound is nice, not too tinny."
2,Didn't last,"When I ordered these (as Christmas gifts) they came very fast. They looked great. The description says there are 6 tubes, but all 4 that I ordered had only 5 tubes. Not too big of a deal for me, but I noticed. They sounded great, but after about 3 weeks, 3 out of 4 of them fell apart. I guess the [...] wasn't such a great deal after all."
2,Sad piece of work...,Several questions in the book contain wrong answers. I can only hope that the CLEP exam does not follow this example!
3,You need to be tall.,"Nice fit and finish with easy adjustments for the price,BUT. It is OK for me at 6'1"" feet but my wife at 5'4"" had trouble getting comfortable. The head ring did not go low enough or the seat did not go high enough. She found herself stretching to much to plant her face in comfortable position. If your six foot plus I'm sure you will give this a five star but and 5'4"" you will give it a 1, unless you want to over stretch your body when getting a massage."
1,Misrepresented item,This item is absolutely NOT aluminum. I specifically ordered this and paid more for this item due to the description of chair frame being made of aircraft aluminum. I verified that it is the item pictured and that it is. So it is not a case of sending me the wrong item by mistake. This is an intentional misrepresentation.
4,Massage Chair,"I received this chair with in a very reasonable amount of time. When i opened the box, i found the massage chair in its case already assembled. When trying the chair out, it was EXTREMELY comfortable and very easy to manage. The product information said it was 20 lbs but it seemed to be much lighter. The carrying case was a little hard to manage when putting back on the chair and the strap didnt seem to be in a good place in order to carry it. But overall, this is a GREAT chair for the price range."
3,cushions,Head and chest cushions are to soft and I would recommend removable head rest cover other wise it is a good product.
5,Excellent massage chair!,"The chair arrived quickly and in excellent condition. The padding is so comfortable, the chair sets up and takes down easily and is so portable. It easily adjusts to fit clients of all shapes and sizes, I have been thrilled with my purchase!"
5,Comfortable,We love this chair. Light weight and sturdy. We are 5-10 and 5-3 and we are comfortable on it.
4,Gloria's got soul,"Gloria Lynne had been almost forgotten for far too long a time. She did have several hit records in the 1960's at a time before those puerile Beatles changed forever the complection of popular music.This four CD collection presents eight of her Everest albums. As far as value for dollar is concerned, how can you go wrong? Collectibles Records packaged this collection nicely in a wooden box. The original record notes are included.My favorite CD is the one with Marty Paitch and strings. Gloria's singing is controled and the arrangements are rich. My least favorite CD is the one including the two live albums. Here Gloria gets into some vocal acrobatics, and shows her gospel background.Gloria is hard to classify. Like Dinah Washington, she is just as comfortable singing pop, R and B, or jazz.In any case, she represents good taste."
3,An interesting mix of music,"I bought this CD after seeing a video of ""This Wheel's on Fire"" on YouTube that blew me away. It's still great on the CD, though seeing the video adds something to the impact. This CD also includes the group's interpretation of ""Light My Fire"" and the gospel song ""Take Me to the Water."" Julie Driscoll has a raspy, sexy voice that works well with the material. The songs are a bit different -- some of them begin with sound effects like the slamming of a door. ""This Wheel's on Fire"" was my favorite track, and I enjoyed ""Light My Fire."" Some of the others didn't do much for me. The album is a compilation of the songs the group did from 1967 to 1971. All in all, I can see why the group did not achieve huge stardom in the U.S. But fans of '60s era jazz/rock and the singing style of Dusty Springfield will most likely enjoy this CD. Brian Auger's organ playing is amazing on some tracks, especially ""Wheel's on Fire."""
3,A few great songs -- rest of this collection a downer,"""Tramp"" was one of my favorite songs of the '70s and I love this version of ""Season of the Witch"" and there are a couple other tunes on this CD I can listen to with gladness. That's the 3 stars.The minus 2 stars are the other tunes."
1,Where is support?,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
5,John Lithgow is Wonderful!,John Lithgow is perhaps one of the most talented celebrities around. He sings traditional songs that are not commonly heard and revives them. His songs are sung with spirit. He has a wonderful singing voice. This audiotape is great to listen to in the car or home. My children enjoy this because it is different than listening to Nursery Rhymes. They love Animal Crackers in My Soup. I highly recommend this cassette!
5,Highly Recommended,One of the few kids CD's that mom and dad won't get tired of!! I love that it exposes my little guy to different types of music. Interesting lyrics that don't get annoyingly stuck in your head!! A great find!
2,let's call this one Bossa Lite,"For some reason this one sounded better at the listening station in the store and failed to deliver once I got it home--go figure. Tropicale doesn't have the dance groove that previous bossa brava compilations had. In fact, this one tries to be a lot cooler--like lounge music but doesn't quit cut it for me. Besides the cuts ""Never Before"" and ""Orbit Lounge"" I really can't tell the difference between these. Perhaps it'll grow on me--let's hope."
1,do not order from this place,"the product took a very long time to arive and the product was defective. the button to release the charger connection plug to the phone was missing. i didn't realize it and plugged it into my cell phone and could not release it. i had to use pliers to release it and broke the connecting plug. i didn't bother to go through the hassle of returning the product because it would probably cost me out of pocket expense and who knows how long it would take before i received another defective charger. i ended up going to the store and paid more for a new, working charger. i am very disappointed!!! do not order from this place...ever."
5,Blue Zora Blues,"ZORA YOUNG Learned My Lesson Delmark One of Chitowns leading ladies. Unrecorded &under appreciated by those who never heard here, this is one of Chicago's divas. Herfirst CD was absolutely KILLEEERRRR. This one is just as good. everybody has had aPITY PARTY, a good person feelin' BAD. Nice piano work by Ken Saydak, THE LORD HELPSTHOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES is sweet. Does great job on Delbert McClinton song BET-TER OFF WITH THE BLUES. DAMN YOUR EYES is as good a cover as I have heard (Ettabetter:) Percy's SOMEBODY TO LOVE is a tune from heaven folks. GREAT job there. Zora hasbeen REAL deal FOREVER. Gimme mo' lady..soonnnn...."
4,Straight Gangsta,"Volume 10 letf us with a bangin' classic ""Pistolgrip Pump"" and just when you thought that was it, he hits us with anotha album full of that true gangsta walkin', switch hittin', can I hit that dosia music. With producers like Big Clever, Massive, Bumrap, and Bear who keep it musically tight with Volume 10 on the Miz-zike, you can't get better that this. Yeah baby. This album keeps my fake, internet-gangsta steelo real... and my wanna-be, ignorant thug stzyle true. This album makes me front! Hard!"
2,Just download the only good song and save your money...,"I'm glad I downloaded the songs off of iTunes instead of buying the entire CD..it gave me a chance to see that purchasing the album would have been a waste.If you've heard ""Underwear Goes Inside the Pants"" on the radio or elsewhere and are expecting an album full of the same stuff, you will be disappointed. The other ""songs"" focus more on electronica, and the sampling is just cheesy, not entertaining.Go see Greg Giraldo perform....he's the comedian sampled in ""Underwear"", and he does not appear elsewhere on the album. The rest of the musings are boring and not worth the money."
5,Inspirational & Transformational,"To get the full impact of the album, pay attention more to the words and what they are specifically saying than the music. The music creates a wonderful ambiance, but the words and what they say is the true key to get the message."
2,"Good material, poor fit and design","Pros- The material is densely woven, warm enough for outdoors winter wear, and stain/splash resistant. High waistband prevents plumbers butt, and the shirt stay does its job.Cons- These are SNUG, fine if you're a model standing around, but too tight to work in. Lack of give in the material, or a full cut in the design, prevents rigorous activity. Unlike every pair of BDU's I've ever owned, the reinforced knees are sewn inside of the pant leg. This seam will skin your kneecaps at every given opportunity. A penlight will fit in the side pocket, but a standard 1"" diameter flashlight wont. The price is comparable to regular BDU's, and has a few extra features. But compared to 5-11 Taclite EMS pants (which are pricey at 60USD), these have a third of the features, and non of the comfort. Unfortunately, I bought the Rothco's from an outside vendor, so instead of getting a refund, I'm be donating 'em to charity."
3,Ripped Pockets,"I have had the pants only a short time...perhaps they have been worn/washed 6-8 times. The other day I put my hand in my left front pocket only to have it tear along the seam. I do not put many items in this particular pocket. I was a little disappointed. Otherwise, the FIT, etc has been acceptable with these Pants. I was considering another purchase of this item...however, if they are going to do this I will make another selection."
2,Sizes are off and the seams are flimsy.,"So I ordered the pants and have worn them twice. As soon as I put them on I knew they were too big. I am a big dude so I ordered the large and they were swimming on me, but they have the side zips so it wasn't a big deal. What is a big deal is that today is the second time I have worn them and the seam in the crotch split. These are made for emergency services and they fall apart after a second wearing? If you don't plan to do anything strenuous in them I guess you will be okay, but I imagine most of us need pants that can survive the job, these aren't those pants."
2,Don't last long.,They looked great right out of the package. After 2 washes they are falling apart. Very disappointed in the quality of the pants.
2,Wrong color,"Came tagged as Navy Blue, but was far darker than it seems. Was trying to use this as a costume, needed a blue like the picture, it's darker."
3,Wrong sizes,"I ordered size medium, the only option available for this size. I was sent medium longs. They will have to be altered, too long and the waist just a bit snug. I had previously ordered Large which was long and quite a bit too big in the waist. Their size incrementations leave something to be desired. If you can get a pair that fits they will nice pants, but good luck with that part."
2,tight,"After reading the reviews I knew I had to watch the waist size, but these pants are tight in the thighs. Pants are well built, just sized funny."
3,Decent Pants,"These pants are good for the price. However, the waist does run small. I even ordered a size larger and was not quite what I expected. Also the fabric is not that heavy. I have not worn them yet but I am not sure if they could handle hard abuse day in and day out like the few pairs of 5.11 that I own."
1,too bad,"I recently decided to buy these pants for work. when I got them I found that the sizing was so wide range that when I ""fit"" them to my waist, they were bunched up on the sides. considering that I have to tuck my white shirt in for work (like MOST EMTs do) I would have been walking around with pants that were obviously too big for me... even though they were supposed to fit between 5 different sizes. too bad."
3,"Nice pants, poor size chart","I just got these in the mail. The delivery speed was great and i really liked the pants. But i had to go back to the post office and return them. The size chart is not the same as say a pair of pants from walmart. I normally wear a 34 waist. These pants give a size range on the tag for the medium from 31 to 35. Well they were no where near a 35, nor a 31. I'd say they were closer to a 28-30. Good pants but be sure to order larger than your ""normal"" size."
4,Great hard waring pants,"Breaths great, resists stains, double layered knees, heavy fabric, quick adjustment straps. The only thing really missing in these pants is double stitching"
1,bad sizing chart,I ordered these pants from their sizing chart and they pretty much match my jeans at home when i recerived them they said they were the right size on the tag but i couldnt fit them over my thighs they were about six sizes to small. they need to revamp their sizing charts.
4,Good Pants for the price,"Got the pants. Most people said they ran small in reviews, so I ordered a large. I am 6'0"", 33 inch waist. Should have ordered medium, large are HUGE on me. But the waistband tightens, and with that and a belt, they fit just fine. Legs are long, but are perfect length with my steel toe boots. Lots of pockets, durable product, etc. Hope this review helps"
4,"Good Fit, Great Price.","I was hesitant to purchase these pants at first due to some of the negative reviews, but I am glad that I did in the end. The pants are a nice deep black and look professional. All of the pockets are easily accessible and allow you to store a lot of gear. However as some of the reviews have mentioned make sure to order a size up like I did, I wear a size 34x36 typically and the large long size fits well."
4,EMT Pants,"These are nice pants, the fit is off some so order a half to full size larger waist. Plenty of pockets and one of few that come hemmed already."
4,El Grande,"I decided to take the advice of the reviews and purchase a size larger than my normal one. I was pleased by the quality of the pants, but they were large enough to park an ambulance in!So the product is made very well, but the size issue should be taken care of."
4,Lots of pockets. Seems well made.,"These were a little long for my daughter, who is 5' 4"", but they have ties on the bottoms of the cuffs so they can be secured to your ankles, so they do fit without getting caught under your shoes. My daughter, who is studying engineering in college and is a bit of a geek, loves being able to carry all her electronics, keys, and gadgets."
3,hmm..are we always well?,"datach'i is an adventerous and largely experimental electronic artist who deals mostly under the vast umbrella of what is known as IDM (Intelligent Dance Music). but i'm not sure what kind of dances could be done to these songs. perhaps this is best viewed as the soundtrack to a computer crashing due to a lethal virus. some tunes inject a cute sense of melody that is very similair to Aphex Twin. but overall, alot of this stuff is bound to go over many people's heads...as it does mine. ""Wearealwayswellthankyou"" is an interesting listen at times, but it's difficult to really devote myself to Datach'i's unusual style."
1,pointless!,We Are Always Well Thank You is yet another contribution to the already mountainous pile of fast and furious but completely meaningless and uninteresting electronic poop. I give this CD one star for possible use as a coaster.
4,Teacher Cat Fight!,"If anyone hated high school and relishes the idea of reading a book where stuffy teachers threaten each other, act like children, and commit homicide then give this book a try. I think this book could have been better than it was but as a murder mystery it has the right stuff and I didn't guess who the murderer was (always a bonus)!"
3,Nowhere near an original story but I like it!,"First off, you can't go into comparing these horror flicks to big budget ones haha. That being said, if you can handle bad acting and appreciate the story itself, than you can enjoy this little horror flick. Besides, that old gypsy is kinda creepy. Again, not the strongest ghost flick you've seen already, but this one has its moments! Will Jennifer overcome her obsession with the gypsy's oracle!?....you'll just have to find out!"
1,STUPID,"This flick has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen!It's so stupid and the lead actress's screams give me agita!!!bad bad bad bad film!!!!!!!!!!!!This director also did the notorious exploitation SNUFF, I don't know what happend when the director did this piece of @#*%! I wish i could give it a bomb rating but the lowest i can possibly give it is 1 star-too bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Nice and certainly cute!,"Its inexpensive and cute too! Def not an eye-sore in the room. However, it doesn't hold much in the way of water... so be sure to have this in a small room. And even then you'll be refilling it often. Very quiet too. A nice buy."
3,"Nicely made, but . . .","This is a nicely made product and fit snugly into a one-inch drain in the bathroom sink.But, oddly, it substantially impeded the water flow to the point where we had to remove it.My theory is that the holes are smaller than they could be, resulting in enough solid metal left to block about half the flow.Now I am searching for a screen that has more area available for water flow, but will still be effective in catching debris.Jerry"
3,"It does the job, but not quite the right size","I have two of these strainers in each of my bathrooms. I like them more than the drain catch, but they do impede the flow of water if you are at high flow. Mine don't quite fit into a 1 inch drain hole, in fact the one sent is exactly the same size as the one in my other bathroom (1-1/32 inch strainer from Home Depot), but at about twice the cost. It wasn't worth it to return, but beware that you'll need a drain hole larger than 1-1/32 inch in diameter."
3,Good for temporary use,"This does make water drain pretty slow, so soap bubbles don't all wash down. I like it to put down when I'm putting in my contacts, but usually leave it out. It fits about halfway in my drain, which is nice for taking it out."
1,"Decoding the Codes: A Comprehensive Guide to ICD, CPT& HCPCS","I was considering purchasing this book, but after reading the comments by others who purchased the book, I decided against it. How is it that the book is rated ""5 stars"" with dissatisfied readers? I'm glad I saved my money!"
5,Where are the answer keys,It would be very helpful to have an answer key to the exercises. Are they available?
1,Saddened by Spiderman costume,"I saw this adorable spiderman costume online at toys r us. I have been looking for a Halloween costume for my 14 month old son and couldn't find one until I saw this. But when the costume came to our house, It was nothing like the picture. There were no Spidey eyes on the hood and there was not a red spider on the back. Those were the two things that made me fall in love with this costume. I can't believe that this store can get away with false advertising. I guess that's what to expect for only $10.00. I am very very disappointed."
2,Item Not As It Is Pictured,"This item is made of thick material and is made well. The only problem with it is that it doesn't look like the pictures. There is no spider on the back, no eyes on the hood and the design on the chest is not the same as the picture."
5,This kid is too good looking!,"This child looked like he was having so much fun being in that costume, my wife and I had to purchase this item. It is durable, warm and fun all rolled into one! It is half the price of any costume you can buy for your kid at any retail store!Get your child one today!"
2,NO...No.No. Nanette,"Fans of the popular 1971 Broadway revival of this 1920's musical will be curious about this, the second filmed version(the 1930 one never urns up anywhere) It's fun to see Anna Neagle as Nanette even if she is a little long in the tooth..she later played the maid in the London revival in 1973. Eve Arden also appears but VERY few of the songs from the show made it into the film. And ths appears to be a film TAPED OFF OF TV as there are fadeouts where commercials once were!!!"
1,Best forgotten,"This video is a 1940 movie long thought lost. With that cast, I thought, it was worth the money. It isn't. The film stinks. The director seems to be wholly inept. Anna Neagle is sorely miscast."
4,A good introduction to Project: Orion,"This was a good production with some interesting tidbits. Most the information could be gleaned from a google search but it was entertaining to have some of the designers and developers of orion interviewed. Not much discussion was given to the shock absorbers and the inventor of nuclear pulse propulsion wasn't given credit, Stanislaw Ulam.Another documentary to watch is ""to mars by abomb"" which at this time is not available on Amazon but for a while was watchable on youtube (its been taken down).If you want to know more about the particulars I recommend George Dyson's book ""Project Orion: The True Story of the Atomic Spaceship"" which is available on Amazon. George Dyson is Freeman Dyson's son."
4,"Fine edition, except for...","Missing the editorial notes from the Practical Philosophy volume of the Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant, despite the fact that the numbers of the notes are retained in the text! This seems like a silly, wholly unnecessary oversight, since the editorial notes for the Critique of Practical Reason run to all of three pages!"
5,Truer than fiction,"This CD contains some great dance tracks, similar to her previous material. It includes the singles ""Desire"" and ""Get It Up (The Feeling)""...but it doesn't stop there, oh no. Other house style tracks include ""Breakfast For Two"" a potential single, similar to ""Desire"" and ""Dear John"" which sounds like her hit ""Found A Cure"", a few years back. ""Twisted"" is slow and haunting almost, and infact the whole album is full of great tracks - all 13 songs infact!"
2,more vanilla club stuff,the market is officially saturated with an abundance of bland club tunes- same gospel vocal and 4/4 beats. try something new.
4,good room heating,"I use this heater in a 120 sq ft apartment room and it works great w/the door closed. I only need to use it on the 6th setting out of 14 for ""light long sleeve"" weather. I usually leave it on the floor in it's ""vertical"" position. It usually takes about 20 minutes for the entire room to heat up. The thermostat control is really nice, so i don't have to touch it once I turn it on. The temperature remains constant."
2,Cook'n on the Go for Palm OS,"No idea how well it works since it doesn't work with Palm OS higher than 5.0. Company says it won't have the bugs worked out and an update until sometime the summer of 2005, so you might want to hold off buying it until then."
1,No support,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
1,Design Defect burns drive...,"QPS drives have a problem. QPS uses OEM drives, they do not manufacture the drives. If the drive's native interface is converted by QPS, this interface burns the drive after a few hours if you are lucky. This usually happens with IDE interface drives converted to firewire interface."
5,Humorous and Powerful,"The prayer of Jabez, tucked away in the deep forest of scripture, is a powerful prayer that can change people, churches, and entire communities. Jay Dennis, senior pastor of First Baptist Church at the Mall in Lakeland, FL, takes the reader on the spiritual journey with him and the FBC@TM community as they pray this prayer together and set out in faith to pursue the calling of God for their church to reach the community through the purchase of an entire abandoned shopping mall and converting the mall to a ministry. Having seen the results first hand, this book will be a huge encouragement to pastors who are seeking fresh strength to push their churches to the next level."
3,Feels flimsy but does the job OKAY,"I peel hard green papayas to make salads etc. using this little tooland its not easy, in fact it is difficult work and this tool works hard ...one complaint, its flimsier than i like so i have ordered metal ones from a fine food supply store and soon i'll find out if that higher price one is any better."
4,required for class 3,"The book is more of a sale's pitch for the company. I believe the professor works for the company or at least did in the past. Our professor choose this as one of our required readings. If you're a professor, I think there may be better choices out there. This book however, is better than the other two used in class."
5,Excellent book,"I read this book for an Instructional Leadership course. If you want to become a better instructional leader, especially in unfamiliar subjects, this is a great resource. It is also a good for professional development for teachers who want a better understanding of how students learn."
3,Bright enough????,I have one of these and its a great idea...BUT with a drawback. I wanted it for use at the track...outside use in daylight. It didn't have a bright enough flash for outdoor use to be able to see your timing marks. Might be ok for indoor use. Not sure how the other makers lights work.
2,Works well... if it is working.,The wire at the point where it connects with the mike is too fragile. After 3 months it has lost contact and is useless to me now. Fixing it is a hassle and the minimum bench charge at the Sony store is prohibative.
3,Fool me once...,"Some people see things as they are and say why? Other people see things on DVD's that are not there and say ""review it??"" Why not! Please be aware that while the Letterman Christmas DVD,""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"", recorded live in Ohio in front of an audience made up entirely of grandmas, :) is a nice DVD it DOES NOT include Tony Butala singing the beautiful ""What can I give you this Christmas."" The previous reviewer was in error. The CD includes it, but the DVD does not. Unfortunately since the contents were not listed I had to rely on a reviewer. Unfortunately that song was the only reason I bought the Video. Oh well."
1,Extremely dissapointed,"I just got this product today, just took it out of the package and I'm already unhappy. The sound quality is a joke. Even the simple ""click"" sound when I open a page on a website sounds terrible. I can't get the microphone to work even though I know its not a problem with my computer. The headset I bought to replace this one with was about as broken as it could possibly be and the microphone on that one still worked. It doesn't make any sense that a brand new headset wouldn't work properly.I started to lose interest in SONY a few years ago when my Playstation 2 was stolen and I realised that I never enjoyed any of the game on it enough to buy a new one. Since then, I've still respected SONY's products as being of high quality... until now."
3,Wonderful SONY SET! But ...,"As many do say, there is usually the problem of having to have the microphone very close to your lips/mouth. Sometimes i had to actually put it in my mouth to make sure people heard me. There has been times i have Bought this and there were very light popping sounds in the background, but then i did not have the money to return or anything! Anyway, they usually last me anywhere from 8 months to 2 years. Really depends on how well i care for them. YES i do care for my stuff, but when you have nieces/naphew who want to hear what you are listening to sometimes, you just gotta tell them firmly how to not ruin them. Because YES THIS HEADSET IS VERY FRAGILE!!!! And it is for users like myself whom know how to set things to Stereo/Mono EXT. Great Product, just needs some durability to it, such as the MICROPHONE. The Mic Does not always Recognize any sounds, even with good set settings. HOWEVER I DO LOVE SONY AND HP VERY MUCH!!!"
2,Frustrating,"I purchased this headset for use with Skype to communicate with colleagues overseas. However, the microphone is awful. I literally need to have the microphone toughing my mouth in order for my colleagues to hear. This type of quality is disappointing for a Sony product."
3,Sony DR-220DP PC Headset,"The sound for the headphones is good, the mic picks up your voice just fine. The big problem with this headset is that it does not fit snuggly against your ears, so in order to hear the sound you have to press it against your ears with your hands or in my case put on a headband over them! Not very convenient. nor attractive! Would not buy again."
4,An Excellent Read,"When one considers the boring, cliched, cookie cutter plot line drivel that is being turned out by the majority of African American 'so called' writers today. Shay Youngblood along with many other writers such as Colin Channer stand above the crowd.After reading 'Black Girl in Paris', which I also enjoyed. I read this novel over one weekend, I just couldn't put it down. Youngblood weaves a story full of metaphors and analogies that are at times surprisingly erotic."
4,Great book on little known war,"The Soviet invasion of Finland remains one of the lesser known segments of World War II. This book, written by Finns, is a solid account, explaining the battles in detail. The Finns are a proud people, and the book is from the Finnish view so I would not call it 100% objective. Plus the book downplayed the Finnish alliance with the Germans, but I gained respect for the tough fortitute of the Finnish winter fighter. Until a comprehesive military history of the war is written this book is the best avaiable."
3,"Trotter's ""A Frozen Hell"" is much better","I'm not sure but this book feels like it was translated directly from Finnish to English. Some of the grammar and sentences are a bit odd, and not all the terminology is explained that well. Also, the author seems to see the glass as having been half-filled, so to speak, as it regards to Finland's heroic last stand against the Soviet juggernaut. Although she does acknowledge that the miraculous triumphs of 1939 ultimately led to Finland's defeat in 1940, and mentions the painful concessions that followed, the author, like most Finns, lets her patrotism diminish her vision of what really happened and the consequences. Trotter is much more objective. He portrays the war as it really was, a brutal and mostly forgotten part of the second World War. If you really want to know more about the Winter War, get this book and ""A Frozen Hell: The Finno-Russo War of 1939-40"" by William R. Trotter."
4,Stories of Heroism,"This book was not meant to be a political study, but rather a research effort to record the heroic deeds and events that happened in the War with the Sovit Union before they were lost to history. The authors do give some background into the war and some insight into the Soviet reasoning. This, however, is not the main thrust of the book. The individual stories make this an exciting book to read. The tremendous hardships endured are scarcely even imagined today much less experienced. I recommend this book to everyone who has an interest in Finland and World War Two."
5,Works great.,"Perfect solution to add bass in certain types of music. Easy install, great price. I have had it installed for over 6 months not a single problem yet. Only thing I would recommend is use a different fuse holder than the one given, feels really cheap."
5,BIG BIG DEAL,"My 3 yr old son really loves Audio Adrenalin's 'Big House.' I've been looking for a ""children's compilation"" of familiar songs he listens on KLove. When we played it, he danced & was thrilled :) I think I was just as thrilled too. PLUS....the price was UNBEATABLE. love it!"
3,"The ""Color Science Bible""","I bought this book for my studies in the M.S. Color Science program at the Rochester Institute of Technology. It is a very detailed and math-oriented view of many aspects related to color & color science. I've sometimes heard it referred to as the ""Bible"" of Color Science.Bottom line is that it's a great reference book for detailed, mathemetical views of Color Science topics. It's not a very good book to read for general information or an overview on color science. I'd highly recommend ""Principles of Color Technology"" by Roy Berns as a good all-around 1st book on color science. Much easier and more enjoyable to read. The Wyszecki & Stiles is more of a reference book if you need the next level of detail after that."
4,This 'bible' needs up-dating - - but is the foundation stone,"This 'bible' in the world of Color needs up-dating - - but it is the foundation stone. If you are seriously in the color business, you will need this book on your bookshelf from time to time."
4,Comprehensive,"This is probably not a good ""first book"" in color science. However, if you do have knowledge of the field (or are taking a class in it) then it can be a very good reference."
3,Worth the money,"This book has a ton of useful information from lighing science to technical color computations. The book (bible) has allot of data charts that can be used for sample or comparision calculations. If you are involved in Optics, Lighting, Illumination, industrial, automotive or aerospace. Then you got to get his book!"
5,Favorites before Ska era;,I played this at a Jamaican picnic for teachers and they went wild when they heard these songs from childhood days. My father had these on 78 rpm over 50 years ago.
1,Save your money,"I've found MP3 Editor to be completely useless. You cannot make a CD from your MP3 files with it and the editing is too limited. I can't even adjust the volume of the whole song easily. Plus, I bought it because it had a rebate which now [I'm being denied] by saying that my receipt was dated outside of the offer, making this software a double ripoff."
2,Just...not great.,I didn't feel any stress relief from doing this video! I was expecting some good stretching and calming poses but there just weren't any. Not worth even the $1.99 rental fee :(
2,Poor video,"The instructor is irritating. She will be in the middle of a move, your body in a squat and you hands in the air and then it just changes scene to another move. Never tells you to release, no transition, it's odd. There were even a couple where she didn't do the other side... It was so frustrating I had to stop. Try something else."
3,Clymer Honda 450 & 500Cc Twins : 1965-1976,"This manual covers all the bases when it comes to restoring or repairing your honda twin.Each section went into complete detail for assembling with helpful pictures to assist you in the harder steps. Text also contains helpful data on engine rebuilding, torque settings, liquid capacities and air pressures."
3,"Sketchy on ""How To""","Pictures are pretty good. However, description in many diagrams does not match description in text, creating doubt at times. Book tells you what to do but is often vague on telling you how to do it (it's not always obvious)."
5,Now THIS is an English text!,"Patterns of Exposition is the BEST English text I have ever had the pleasure of using. Period. The book is well organized, providing a clear and concise definition of each pattern and following it with several examples. The essays contained within are all thoughtful, diverse, and fine models of the discussed expository techniques. You will probably learn more about expository writing (and how to become a talented writer yourself) by carefully reading each essay, dissecting them, and pondering their guided questions, than you will during your entire freshman year of college."
3,Used for college,I rarely used this college book. My teacher required this as a book for his class. The prompts were good for creating essays.
4,Stage IV great series nearly done justice with this release...,"Finally an official R1 release of Initial D Stage IV...and its really good! Visual presentation is not bad at all, the best of all Inital D stages in fact. And the Japanese audio track is done really well - best sound quality I have ever heard from Initial D. The subtitles are passable, not that bad. The English dub is still horrible...but then again there has NEVER been a good Dub of any Initial D stages. The video is present in 4:3 widescreen format, not 16:9 as indicated on the DVD cover. Initial D has never been made in 16:9 ratio anyways, has always been 4:3 format.Stage 4 is the best quality of all the Stages, both in art and story. Part II wraps it up nicely and the last two races (god hand and god foot) are the ones that take it to the next level...Highly recommended."
4,Maybe a bit too much,"The Spinners was arguably the greatest soul/r&b group of the 70's, rivaling even the O'Jays, another great group from the Philadelphia label. However, as with many box sets, this set is aimed primarily at collectors and die-hard fans, collecting numerous tracks that have been difficult to find on CD over the years. Most people, even longtime fans, are better served by the definitive double-disc set, ""One of a Kind Love Affair."" Covering their early years with Motown through their peak period of Philly Soul, that set has everything you need. Fans who want a bit less, i.e. just the big, major hits, are advised to get ""The Very Best of the Spinners."""
5,Tai Chi is beautiful and I highly recommend it.,"This cd is not only great for a spa or yoga setting, but also good for some meditations and even background music for a laid back party."
3,Tai Chi Music for Relaxation,Music wasn't exactly what I was looking for but it arrived on time and I am listening to it.
1,***********SUFFOCATION RISK************,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM B/C BABIES DO LOVE THE TAGS ON THINGS BUT THIS EVENING MY 4 MONTH OLD ALMOST SUFFOCATED BECAUSE OF IT! I LOOKED OVER TO HER SITTING ON THE HER BOUNCY SEAT TO FIND THE 12 X 12 BLANKET COMPLETELY OVER HER FACE AND HEARD HER GASPING FOR AIR! I RUSHED OVER TO HER AND THANK GOD SHE WAS AND IS OK! I JUST WENT ON THE TAGGIES WEBSITE TO FIND THE BLANKET IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES AND IS APPROVED BY JMPA, TIA AND ICPHSO. I AM SURE MY BABY IS NOT THE FIRST TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN AND I WOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT BUYING THIS ITEM FOR A BABY DESPITE IT BEING RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES. THIS ALSO GOES TO SHOW THAT EVEN THOUGH AN ITEM IS APPROVED BY VARIOUS SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS, THAT MAY NOT MEAN THE ITEM IS IN FACT SAFE."
5,Star Wars Episode 1 R2-A6 with Metalized Dome,"First off, I am very dissatisifed with this purchase. Dont get me wrong, the toy itself is awesome and mechanically sound and the box appears un-tampered with, however the toy is extremely ""yellowed"" as if sitting in the sun or hot place for a very long time. I was buying this for collecting purposes since I already have one ""out of the box"", but this one is useless to me as a collector item in this condition. I am quite upset that the add did not mention anything about this item being ""yellowed"""
1,Poor remote,"I bought this to control my new Sylvania LCD TV, and I tried to get it to work for an hour with no luck. I called Sony, they were no help. I called Sylvania, they were no help. And this remote doesn't even have a light on it to see if it is actually working. Come to find out, it was manufactured in 2003--why are they still selling this at retail stores???"
1,Remote Commander Rip-Off,"This product will not program any TV or cable box in the house. I have been using universal remotes for many years, so I know what I'm doing. Beware!"
2,"Didn't work on my TV, bad customer support","I bought this remote as a replacement for my Haier TV. It didn't work when I tried to set it up so I called customer support. After being put on hold for quite a while, they did nothing but tell me that it's not guaranteed to work on all TVs.So, if you have a Haier TV, don't get this remote."
3,Burnished Butterfly Lights,"The picture makes it look like the wire is the same color as the butterflies. However,the wire the is Christmas green. I wish I had seen them in Target first."
4,Great Book!,"If you love golf, and golf courses, you will love this new book. Being an Oklahoman is not a necessity to enjoy this...just a golf fan. I especially liked this because of the detail behind Perry Maxwell, and the background of his courses. While this year's U.S. Open brought Southern Hills (Tulsa) into the spotlight again, Maxwell also designed (or redesigned) great courses such as Augusta National (redesign of several holes), Dornick Hills (Ardmore), Oklahoma City Golf & Country Club, and several others nationwide."
2,NOT A TRUE 17 INCHES LONG.....MISLEADING,The sound is nice enough but the true length is 12 inches. They are measuring the string where the chimes hang down to the bottom of paddle. The chimes themselves are only about 6 inches. That's the true measure of what they will sound like.
4,Will order larger next time,"Unit was delivered and packed safely. I have relocated chimes a few times in hopes of finding ideal place for it to ""sing."" It really sounds sweet. However, I will order a larger unit in the future, as this is just too small?Again, the sounds it makes is really gorgeous though."
3,SeasonLover,This item is nice but very small. I was hoping it was largerso it would look pretty on my front porch. It is actuallylost out there.
2,Disappointing!,"I received this for Christmas, along with another Woodstock windchime, and I have to say that I was very disappointed with both of them. No matter where we hang them, we get little or no sound from them. Since I have owned a Woodstock windchime before and loved it, I expected the same from these, but not so. They look very nice, but do not do what they are supposed to do, that is, make a beautiful sound."
1,Forget it,Do not buy it. I got the ball and not the disk as shown in the picture. It barely chimes in a strong wind. I eventally may try to reengineer it. I was late getting it out of the box. I should have sent it back for non performance and a refund. I'd hesatate to buy anything else from this company because the one product I bought was so bad in performance.
2,Takes a serious gust to hear it.,"I have another Woodstock Percussion wind chime which I'm, really happy with, but this one is disappointing. Despite the product image showing a fairly sized striker wheel, it's really a small wooden ball and it takes a strong wind to get this small ball to hit the tubes. It's a beautiful piece to look at, but I hope they improve the striker to be big enough to cover the circumference of the tubes."
2,It's just okay,"I own another larger Woodstock chime that is so incredibly magical sounding that I ordered this one for my kitchen window. It is small,which I expected and wanted. The short black pipes are fairly loud, but just okay sounding. I thought from the photo the top would be black, in reality it is an uneven medium cherry stain, darker in some areas. The photo depicted ""red"" wind catcher is the same evenly applied cherry stain. Another reviewer suggested going to the woodstock website to listen before you buy-I wish I had on this one as then I would not have bought it."
3,sounds good,"We bought this for a house warming gift for a new neighbor. I know it said it was 17 inches long, but come on. 17 inches from where you hang it to the wind catcher? Oh well. It does sound nice, but honestly you have to be pretty darn close to it to appreciate its sounds. I was disappointed. I bet they were too:("
2,Very small striker,"The wind chime looks okay, but the striker is not the same as it is shown in the picture. Rather than being a ""disk"" almost touching the sticks, it's just small ball that is half an inch away from the sticks. The only time it rings is when I push it by hand.It's a chime alright, but it's no wind chime. Well, if you have a storm then may be then, else ..."
2,misleading advertisement,"My cousin got these for me for Christmas, and we were expecting something much larger. The box says ""FIVE BRONZE FINISH TUBES, 17"" LONG"". This is misleading, because what is actually meant is that the entire chime (strings and all) is 17"" long, while the tubes themselves are actually between 5-8, and therefor very high pitched. This would be fine if that was what we were expecting, but it wasn't. So, if you want little chimes, these are great and have very nice sound. The advertisement, however, we all feel, is misleading."
1,Does Not Work--Worthless,"This windchime is apparently well made, attractive, and of good quality. But, it DOES NOT WORK! A wind much more than a gentle breeze is required for it to make any sound at all. The wind catcher (paddle) is too heavy and too small, an engineering design defect. The windchime is too small, although it conforms to published specifications. The sound is beautiful but can't be heard unless you are next to it. A larger model would probably rate five stars, but this one I do not like.July 18 ---- This review update is after one month of use. The windchime is even worse than the two stars I originally gave it. Big waste of money. I feel cheated. The published product description borders on fraud and is certainly deceptive. Shame on Woodstock."
1,These chimes are way smaller than you think they're gonna be,"This says it ""measures 17 inches"" in the product detail but it's actually less than half that size! If you want a tiny baby wind chime this is cool. However if you think you're getting adult, not toy-sized wind chimes it's a rip-off."
3,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed when i received the delivery of the Wind Chime i had ordered. It came with only 5 lubes, the one i had ordred had 6 lubes specifically mentioned in the product description and also showed 6 lubes in the diagram. This kind of irresponsibility will only bring Customer Dissatisfaction for AMAZON which i believe is otherwise doing a great job."
2,Not all original recordings,"ABKCO has yet to license any of the Cameo-Parkway music to other labels. Be aware that these are NOT the original versions of ""So Much In Love"", Wonderful, Wonderful"" or ""Somewhere"". Keep looking if you want the true original Tymes Parkway songs. They can be found but not here."
1,Not all vocal chords improve with age,"Not only are these NOT the original recordings, these are obviously new recordings of thirty-year old favorites. The age of the artists shows in their cracking voices. This was so unpleasant to listen to, I threw it away rather than subject another music lover to this caterwauling."
2,"Decent quality recording, but not original versions of hits","These are not the original versions of the Tymes hits. If that is what you are looking for, keep looking. Otherwise, a pretty good re-recording of ""Wonderful, Wonderful"" and ""So Much In Love""."
1,Too Bad!!!,"Another poor attempt to present to the public an anthology of the old Cameo/Parkway artists. These are badly re-recorded songs (at least the Parkway ones)of the Tymes, who in their prime, were one of the best! Your only shot at getting the original song is to find the record OR an import that used records to produce a CD anthology. I have several and they are pretty good! So while we wait for ""abkco"" to release the likes of Chubby Checker, Bobby Rydell, Dee Dee Sharp, The Orlons, The Dovells and The Tymes, were are stuck with lesser re-recordings of these artists from the early to mid-60s."
1,Where are the original???,"I am so sick of re-recordings!! Where the heck (I feel much stronger about this) can we find original versions?? Better yet, why doesn't Amazon.com bother telling us what we're really getting?? Every CD of re-recordings should be clearly identified as such!!"
2,"Okay ""updated"" recordings -- But not a value!","When I was kid, So Much In Love was one of the great summer songs. I was wanted this song so much that I bought The Tymes Greatest Hits -- hoping it would be original. I got burned! However, once I gave it a fair listen, I felt a little better about it even though the CD was not cheap. Now that the Cameo-Parkway collection is out, I sold this CD. Don't buy this one if want the original hits. It's not a value!"
5,Perfect printer cable!,"I received this item very quickly, and it has been a great cable to connect my laptop to my printer! Would highly recommend!"
3,decent value for the price,"I, like another reviewer, purchased this to use with Skype, though I am not chatting with friends but using it for some training sessions. I would have rated it higher but the person on the other end said it would frequently cut out so they couldn't really understand what I was saying. I had no problems on my end hearing what was being said, so perhaps it was just my connection. It was fairly comfortable without being too tight on my head and would be comfy for glasses wearers like myself."
5,Great Buy!,These are an excellent value for the money. The cord is about 9 feet long which really allows for flexibility. Sound quality is good.
4,great,it is one good movie . It tkaes a look at the dog s and handlers . Plus ! It gives you info on how the dog works .
1,Bad Service,"I ordered an ac adapter for my camera and I was sent the wrong product. Mistakes happen, I realize this. The really bad part is customer support said that they could not send the correct part and, it will be several days to refund my money. Now I have no adapter, they have my money. I will never buy from compusa or amazon again. I have had problems with compusa before but this will be the last time I fall prey to such bad customer service. VERY UNHAPPY!!!"
3,Good but returned,"Product description on Amazon did not clearly state that this is a range hood that requires ducts. So, made the wrong choice in buying it when I do not have a duct in my kitchen. So, had to return it and Amazon promptly processed the return and refunded the amount."
4,I am cooler than that loser who gave Whistle 3 stars! I rule,"Ultimate Muscle is about this little whimp Mantaro,who soon becomes one hell of a wrestler!It is hella funny and has a bunch of wrestling action.The funniest part is when Mantaro tells his dad to give him playmuscle.If you dont buy it ill kick your sorry ass(that means you guy who gave Whistle! 3 stars)"
5,"simply beautiful, as usual","Dede Wilson is truly amazing. I fell in love with (her previous book) The Wedding Cake Book as soon as I picked it up, and this book is just as great. Her cakes are stunning--there is no other word for how beautiful and unique her designs are."
4,Local NY Artist with Lots of Talent,"This is a very refreshing cd; Music filled with sincere emotion. I enjoy listening to it because it is a change of pace from current pop/rock trends in the media, that ""this-is-a-number-one-hit"" made song. Arist Kevin C. is not trying to make a number one hit, he's just trying to bare his soul. This is sincere music, with nice beats, addictive melodies, and lyrics we can relate to. Plus, it says on the cd that he plays all the instruments! WOW! This guy has talent! Good Luck Kevin in your career! ~k"
4,The perfect marriage!! Ska/punk and 80's metal !!!,"Wow, who knew that the music of my youth could be brought back to life ! If you love ska/punk, this the one! Even if you were never into heavy metal music, these ska bands breath new life into these glorious songs we all remember!"
1,do NOT feed this to your dog!,"I bought one single for my Lab. Yep, he did! He ate it in a matter of minutes. When I say, ""it"", I mean the whole thing! That includes a buncha one-inch bones. I had no idea there were so many in this thing! I would never knowingly give a large dog any bone so small. How do I know there were little bones in it? He's regurgitating them---and painfully I might add. Yep, I am now very worried for him. Yes, he was watched. Labs aren't animals that like to ""drop it"" when they have something in their mouths that they intend on eating. We did manage to toss about 5 bones, he's tossed another 4, so I am wondering how many more there are. YIKES! He did enjoy it however. :-/"
4,Matango: Attack of the Mushroom People,"Definitely a Japanese horror film. It was creepy, just the way I like 'em. Can get a bit hard to follow if you don't watch the whole thing. But a good watch if you do. It also has the option to either 'watch in Japanese, with or without subtitles' or to watch an 'English dubbed verion' for those that don't want to read they're movies. I personally like reading the subtitles. This DVD arrived quickly and in great condition."
5,Another must-have from Ishir Honda,"This is a very mature Japanese monster movie, not at all like the classic and often amusing Saturday afternoon fare of my childhood. With a haunting storyline and images of human nature at it's worst- this is like Gilligan's Island.....on mushrooms.This version is clean and offers both the dubbed and orig version. A must-have for fans of the genre and one of my personal favorites of all time."
3,Hang out with the mushroom people,"After running aground on a mysterious island during a pleasure cruise, a group of the idle rich soon discover that they are sharing the island with previous shipwreck victims, who have mutated into mushroom monsters via the local toadstools. I wonder if this film was meant as a drug allegory. Despite a few creepy scenes when the mushroom people shamble after our heroes, they really seem to be more interested in lying around in the forest and giggling. Even though the protagonists know what will happen to them if they eat the mushrooms, they do so anyway as they give in to despair over their situation. This is a very odd film but enjoyable in a goofy way."
1,Boredom Ahoy,"I remember watching this as a kid. The shipwreck, the mushroom valley. Revisiting films one liked as a kid can be ill advised. Better to leave those memories in their candy coated time capsule.Unfortunately, Matango is tedious and boring! The cool mushroom valley takes forever to get to and then it's only a small cherry on an otherwise talky and dull ""B""-film. Unless you are lost on a desert island with a DVD player and are already infected with mushroom poisoning I'd find some other Japanese film to watch-like Battle in Outer Space or The Seven Samurai. Life is too short."
2,Got fungus?,Really don't get the rave reviews. I love cult faves as much as any geek but this movie is excruciatingly slow - everyone turns into a fungus and takes their sweet time doin' it.
4,A Cult Classic- From Japan!,"This is one strange movie from the 60'soriginally released as ""Matango"" and laterdubbed into english as ""Attack Of The Mushroom People""A group of Japanese citzens are suddenlystranded- when bad weather blows their boatonto a bizarre little island- where thereis barely any food to survive on, except forthe wild mushrooms which grow everywhere.Once you start eating mushrooms, you can't stop.And soon- they become a part of you!Although it has a rather slow pace,this trippy little fantasy filmwill appeal to all fans of the bizarre!One of my all time favorite cult-filmsoffered both in English & Japanese!"
4,Love It,"Bought this for ""double duty"" use. (1)- To watch in computer room while my husband hogs the big tv in living room. (2)- To use during next hurricane down here. Very happy with first use so far, Great sound and picture. Hope I never get to try out second reason I bought this, but after being without power 14 days last year, I have rechargable batteries ready to go ""just in Case!"". I would have given this great little tv 5 stars, but dropped it to 4 because remote battery(included) with remote arrive DOA. I did quite a bit of research online before I purchased this item and have come to conclusion that for size ,quality and price this tv can't be beat!"
2,Didn't pick up any channels,"Living in Fla. I thought this would be good for hurricanes, but I couldn't get it to pick up any channels. I also was not pleased with the ease of use. I have since then ordered another product that is wonderful and picks up about 6 channels, so if a hurricane hits, I don't feel out of touch."
2,Bad sound in speaker,"I would give this a 2.5 out of 5 because of the ugly noise coming from the left speaker. It is like a high pitched ring that will not go away. A little magnetic shielding and better engineering would have made a world of difference.Color and reception is OK. In retrospect, I would spend the $50 to $100 more on a good, name brand TV, unless you can live with the noise."
1,Wouldn't work for me - soooo disappointed,"I bought this TV for my husband to take hunting but we can't get very many channels and the ones we do get have a terrible picture. The TV is an awesome size and the design is really nice with a good size screen. I didn't hook to cable so that may improve the picture but we don't have cable. I tried programming the channels from two different locations 20 miles apart from each other. I tried programming with the antenna on the TV and with separate rabbit ears. It would only pick up one of the three local network stations. It picked up maybe 8 other misc stations which aren't popular. I couldn't get a good picture on any of the stations and I tried adjusting all the menu items, brightness, hue, etc. It didn't even have a good black and white picture .... it was like a white screen with blurry images in the back. Sooooo, sooo disappointed because I wanted to be able to use this at work too."
1,BAD RECEPTION,"I purchased this TV to watch my soap opera at lunch time. I really only wanted channel 2. Not only could I not get channel 2, I only got VHF channels. When I manually moved TV to channel 2 I couldn't get any sound and then when I did occassionally get sound picture would move in and out. TV can only be run by remote control. God help you if you lose the remote control. I went with this TV due to the wonderful reviews it received. I ultimately purchased the Axion 5"" LCD TV from HSN for $128 and immediately got wonderful reception and a great picture, sound and all, on every channel! Do not waste your time with this TV. Its a loser!"
5,tv,The tv is all that it was promised and serves it's purpose. I think the picture is good and the sound is as good as it could be on such a small set.
5,portable 5 inch tv,Perfect travel tv and indoor use. Great for the bathroom when you don't want to miss anything. I love the antenna/source unput feature and the remote control. The TFT screen is much bettter than the other portable tv's I have seen and used before. It's slim design makes it a perfect traveling compagnion.
1,Portable TV,"VERY disappointed with this product. Although the size was good the overall preformance is deplorable. It has poor sound, reception fades in and out constantly regardless of where I use the TV. It takes 10 AA batteries to operate remotely. It does not come with a car adapter. Strongly advise against purchasing this product."
4,Great Gift,"I bought this for my wife and she loves it. The screen is nice and bright and easy on the eyes.The only draw backs I found is that as with most TVs these days, the remote is required for changing the settings. Don't lose the remote! The other is the rechargeable battery is a battery pack [case] for 10 AA batteries."
3,Coby TF-TV505,It is not as good as expected reception wise and even if I get a good picture sometimes the sound will fade in and out. So to some up a great picture and reception is adiquate on most station except sound will sometimes go away
2,Don't waste your money,"I put this on my wish list because it got good reviews. I receved it this month for my birthday and was very disappointed. My little $20 balck and white tv gets better reception than this LCD color tv. I guess it's ok if you want to connect cable to it but its external antenna is terrible. When I put my black and white tv side-by-side with the color, the bw gets a clear picture and sound while the color tv gets good picture but intermitten sound. It's like one of those ""can you hear me now"" cell phone commercials. The sound cuts out every few seconds! How annoying! I'll will be returning this product."
3,LCD Color Television,"I couldn't get the remote control to work with the television. Other than that, everything else is fine."
3,"Amazing value for a small, color TV","It was easy to set up but the instructions lost some comprehension during translation into English. The reception is very location dependant in my home. It is destined to be on my bathroom countertop in a specific location. After many adjustments with the built in antenna, reception was very weak. I switched to an old set of rabbit ears and plugged into the jack on the right side. Reception is now good on some channels. I am satisfied and bring-in the morning news. It is an amazing value considering the price and very convenient size."
2,Not as useful as hoped,"I have had this unit now for almost a month and I'm not 100% happy with it at all. 1 - Hard to program channels 2 - Likely cause of #1 reception with antenna bad do not have this problem with larger set with rabbit ears. 3 - Screen shuts down when one or more of the batteries gets weak, I'm not talking hours here more like under 30 minutes on new or Ni Cad rechargeables 4 - Try dealing with Coby customer service , you have a better chance of winning the lottery. I would not buy this unit if I could do it over again."
1,Save Your Money-Not Worth It,"Save your money on this one folks. It does NOT pick up very many broadcast stations. Only a few UHF stations. Not very good reception I get better reception on a smaller 2.3"" set. If I would have known that, I would have saved my own money. Barely gets 1 star!!!"
2,Doesn't work on batteries/has sound problems,"This television has a great picture, especially since I'm using it without cable. HOWEVER when I put in batteries, I only received sound - no picture. I had hoped to use it without batteries all the time. I returned it to the manufacturer and received another TV in about 6 weeks, after paying shipping and a return charge. It worked great with batteries for about 4 days, and then this one lost the picture too! The sound (even using the plug) cuts in and out occasionally, but it's not a huge problem. This review should replace the first one I sent, after I had just received the TV."
1,"Coby 5"" LCD TV","Horrible reception - could not get any channels clearly, and some not at all. Returned it immediately."
3,Not Bad,Near the mountains. Able to get 5 stations without cable. Only problem the sound fades in and out.
1,NOT HAPPY AT ALL,"I RECEIVED THIS ITEM THIS WEEK-END AND CANNOT GET THE DARN THING TO COME ONE, EXCEPT EVERY NOW AND THEN I GET LUCKY AND IT MAY POP ON BUT IF IT IS TOUCHED AT ALL IT GOES OFF AGAIN. IT'S LIKE THERE'S A SHORT IN THE CONNECTION. WHEN I CONTACTED THE PROVIDER AND ASKED FOR A REFUND THEY LET ME KNOW THAT THERE WOULD BE A 20% FEE FOR RESTOCKING. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THEM TO MY WORST ENEMY!"
2,Poor Reception,"I have purchased a number of small TV's over the years ranging between 2-5"". My spouse likes to have a portable TV available while in the kitchen, bedroom, or in a car. None have been great as far as reception but generally have been acceptable.But I could receive only one channel with this TV. I know from experience where the ""dead spots"" are in my house so that was not the problem.The ergonomics is not good either. These TV's have to be tilted so one can obtain a good viewing abgle. I had trouble getting this TV to remain upright in its tilted position.Anyway I returned it and purchased an axion. It's working fine."
1,Poor Reception,"I loved the size of the TV and the reception on channel 13. Problem was, I couldn't get any of the other channels, so I had to return it."
2,Awkward Controls;Flimsy External Battery Pack,"While the unit looks good and puts out a nice picture, I could not get the TV to work with the battery pack. The pack is external -- fill it with 10 ""AA""'s, snap it in place -- but the contacts are small and apparently don't always line up properly.In addition, the channel setting program is unintuitive,error prone and the instructions useless (there is a toll free number you can call -- do a Google search).If you plan on runnning off the AC converter only (included), and won't be disappointed if many local channels won't be received, you'll do okay.I am returning mine for refund, as I need a reliable portable TV that can run on battery power."
4,Good TV for the money,"I've used mine for a couple of weeks now, and I'm generally pleased with it. The 5"" screen is much better than the 3"" RCA it replaced. My only complaints are that the power supply didn't work well, but that may be my fault. I have it plugged into an outlet with a dimmer switch on it. I replaced it with my trusty Radioshack 3-12V universal power brick, and that works just fine. I like to save the batteries in the event of a power failure. The stand could be better. Fully extended, the set lays down at too much of an angle. It would be better if it racheted to different angles. The remote control is a big plus."
4,small tv,"Nice size for carrying in a briefcase, bookbag, etc. Some reception isn't good when I use it at work because of poor signal but otherwise great picture and ease of use."
4,Great for the $$,Tough little tv. Great size screen for traveling. No problems with it and its durable. Worth every cent!
2,"Coby 5"" LCD color TV",Performance of this unit was very poor. Out of 8 regular stations in this area I could. pick up only two with any clarity. This was in spite of much manipulation of the built in antenna. It would probably work better with a cable connection- but who has one of these available at an outside event?
1,Worthless,1. I live 15 miles from the primary television transmitters. But the Coby refuses to pull in any VHF channel... It's simply worthless for Channels 2-13.2. The page manual is of no practical use. The menu functions are completely unexplained.3. The onscreen menus themselves are cryptic. It took me 15 minutes to realize that a static ridden channel could only be accessed through the remote and not by the up/down channel buttons on the tv.4. This TV wouldn't leave me happy even if I'd paid $29.99
2,reception not so good,"I bought this little 5 inch for the office. I live very near all the tall towers in a metropolitan area. However, the reception for the Coby 5 is just not good. The sound is very good, but sound without visual, um oh well, you get the idea.So, I suppose I would not recommend this small television. Without decent reception, what else is there?Thanks"
3,"good news, bad news","Good news - this little TV has a great picture for channels in your reception range! The best I've ever seen without cable. I have it in my kitchen where there is no cable/satellite access.Bad news - the instructions are HORRIBLE! Existing information is hard to read, obviously written by someone who doesn't speak English. There are absolutely NO instructions for a great deal of the setup. And the REMOTE is THE PITTS. Very difficult to use because of poor quality and lack of instructions. If you're willing to take a gamble because of the very good picture, I say go ahead! I kept mine after giving it a lot of thought."
1,Don't waste your time or $,"There is nothing good to say about this piece of electronics! My mother said that if I didn't having anything good to say..........nice size, that's good.Maybe it should be 1 and 1 16th stars. ;-)"
2,terrible,I gave this gift to my husband for christmas. It is terrible. We can only get one station and even then it has too much static on it. It does work great if hooked up to cable but then again so would any tv. No matter where we went we only got one channel and it was in spanish. No helpful to us since we don't speak the language. I returned the item.
4,Great purchase,"I am very pleased with this tv. It is absolutely perfect when connected to cable. When it's not connected to cable and simply plugged into an outlet it's not as good as I only get one local channel very good and and the rest are snowy, however I think any tv at any price has bad reception if it's not hooked into cable. I am more than satisfied with this purchase, it fits exactly where I need it and was reasonably priced."
4,A BIG LITTLE TV,The display on this little 5 inch TV is outstanding for the price. If you are the only one watching it. It is an LCD so looking at it from the side is not recommended.I hooked up the cable and scanned the channels and I was done and ready to watch cable TV.The one disapointing thing about this TV is that you can not turn the unit on or off via the remote. The remote is about the size of a credit card and about .25 inches thick. The controls are not ver intuitive at all.Aside from the remote issue this is a good quality product.
3,Work fine and they are free,"Work fine. In case anybody wants the rebate pdf, the link ishttp://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/00/10/00/13/94/24/100013942469.pdf"
3,This was purchased and was supposed to net out free,But suspiciously none of that days information remains for me to find out how/why to claim the rebate.So I have bascially overpaid for a product by a no-name maker. Color me embarrassed.
1,No information here about the contents of the book,"I am considering buying such a book, but this page offers no actual information about the contents of the book, not even a one line blurb, or a list of the table of contents. How can we decide if this book is useful from such scant information?"
2,Battery but NO Acid,"I bought this battery as a replacement, of the same type, for my home sump pump. The battery came and as expected it was dry shipped but to my surprise it was NOT shipped with acid to put into the battery. What good is the thing without acid?"
2,The Language of Silence:,"The binding of the book is very loose which was a huge disappointment as they said the book was in much better shape than that. Otherwise, their service was extremely fast and I had the book in just a couple of days."
4,Excellent and solid mallet,"This type of design is the preferred type by any serious cook. Unorthodox, at first, but largely superior after a little practice. Slides much better than a conventional mallet, larger surface area provides more even pounding. You can get much thinner meat with this design than any other, in a shorter mount of time.The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because I wish it was a little heavier. It is pretty heavy as-is, but if it was a little bigger, it would be perfect."
5,Happy with this,Easier than the other meat tenderizers used before. Good long handle and nice weight.
5,Excellent product,We've had this for a few weeks now and have used it for a variety of things. The product is very heavy for a meat pounder but the weight distribution makes it very easy to flatten meat without having to exert too much force yourself. While it doesn't have the tenderizing bumps that some pounders have it seems to tear up the meat less.We've been hand-washing it due to other comments about the product rusting and paint flaking off and its very easily to keep clean since there are no real joints or annoying crevices like you find with the textured meat tenderizers.
5,Good book,Great songs and style. My copy has some printing issues like blurred print but I kept the book any way.
4,Lost Money or Not?,"Teacher could use this to create a cross curriculum lesson using problem solving, deductive reasoning, and perceptions vs. truth. There are some great lessons to be learned from this story and Math is one of them. Children can be introduced to money values, counting, and estimating of time and container sizes. Plus they can learn to use various coins to make the same amount. I enjoyed reading this to my family and seeing their reaction and problem solving skills at work. The author also provides several lessons you could use in the class. Great book for 2nd and 3rd graders to enjoy."
1,WORST TV I EVER BOUGHT,"I HAVE HAD THIS TV EXACTLY 13 MONTHS AND NOW IT SPONTANEOUSLY SHUTS ITSELF OFF SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. CALLED CUSTOMER SUPPORT, BUT THE WARRANTY EXPIRES AT 12 MONTHS SO THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING. EVEN IF I HAVE A WARRANTY, THEY REQUIRE YOU TO SEND THEM THE TV FOR REPAIR, AND YOU INCUR ALL SHIPPING COSTS TO AND FROM, WHICH FOR A NEARLY 100 POUND TV WOULD LIKELY COST YOU A PRETTY PENNY. IF YOU DO A WEBSEARCH FOR ""VIZIO TV PROBLEMS SHUTTING OFF"", THIS PROBLEM COMES UP A LOT. 2 TV REPAIRMAN OFFERED TO FIX IT FOR $550 ($300 FOR THE PART, AND $250 FOR LABOR) BUT BOTH SAID DUE TO AN OVERHEATING PROBLEM IN THE VIZIO, I WOULD HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM IN 1 YEAR. I HAVE SINCE BOUGHT A SAMSUNG WHICH HAS ALWAYS GOTTEN GOOD REVIEWS. I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND BUYING A SAMSUNG OR SONY INSTEAD. THE PICTURES ARE SPECTACULAR. THEY ARE DEFINITELY WORTH THE PRICE AND THEY ALWAYS GET THE BEST REVIEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought a Vizio VP50 about 20 months ago. The picture goes out of control and eventuall goes black after it's been turned on for 10 minutes. Vizio techs seem to know what's wrong and estimate it will cost $578 dollars plus to repair. Sorry, but I'm going to go out and buy a different brand. If you buy Vizio, you better also buy the 2 year extended warranty plan and make time for repair service down the road!"
1,Get something else!!!,"Sinilar problem to another I've seen on the site, only I was lucky enough to have the 2 yr warranty from Costco. Long story short, the tv would cut off on its own with a loud trumpet sound. On the first tv, after a few repair attempts that didn't work, they replaced the tv with what they told me was a ""new"" one. Second tv started having the same problem so I called them back and after some extremely frustrating repair attempts which also didn't work, they are sending me a new tv. Just found out the one they claimed was new last time was actually reconditioned. I purchased the original tv in late Sept. of '07. Already going on my 3rd tv. I am very frustrated and fed up with this tv. I've contacted Costco for their take on this. It's a good price, but PASS IT UP!!!!!"
1,"VIZIO 50"" plasma tv is BAD","I bought ours from Sam's Club after a week of comparitive shopping, and wish I had not seen it. We had it three years when the power supply went out, and after a three month wait on the part and $458 in repairs, we only had it two more months before it went out again, this time some circuit boards with a repair cost of over $700 for parts alone. Gave up on it and bought a different brand."
1,"Cheap, but you get what you paid for","My 42-inch Vizio plasma HDTV recently ""exploded"" -- a loud bang inside the TV and the screen went blank -- and I only had the TV for less than 2 years. The repair will cost me $350. Vizio is cheap, but you get what you paid for."
1,Vizio customer service is horrible,"I bought a Vizio plasma 50 inch tv and their service is horrible. All they do is direct you to a contractor, ITI, who quoted me $575"
1,"Beautiful TV, until it dies on you.","I bought this TV in December of 2006. It had great picture quality and was an all around good TV. It is now 15 months later March of 2008 and I went to go turn it on and it made a nice pop and that was it. It is now dead, conveniently after the 1 year warranty has expired. It cost more to repair it than to buy a new TV! I have never in my life had a TV fail on me, I am completely shocked. Never again will I buy a Vizio, never again."
1,terrible tv do not buy vizio,"Same problem as everyone else only lasted 2 years before popping sound & shut down, we now have to warm the tv up for 5 minutes before cable box can be turned on or it pops and shuts off, also have vertical lines forming about 7 with different colors up and down through entire screen going through them. Save yourself the money and buy a quality tv....always remember you get what you pay for..........djmc2700@aol.com"
1,Cannot recommend this book,"Very disappointed with Cassie Edwards novel. The heroine is suppose to be a biracial woman, but you get the feeling that this is another 'white' woman's romance novel. I was disappointed that the character of Zondra was not a black woman which would have been very interesting. There are not any historical romance novels which portray a black woman and Native American Indian that I know of. It would have been exciting to read this type of interracial novel. The writer plays it safe by making the heroine have white skin and all appearances of a white woman. It's disturbing that the message seems that white is once again better than anything darker. Zondra's is described as being 'blessed' with white skin which is also very disturbing. I cannot recommend this book at all. I hope other books can respectfully portray the romance between black women and Native American Indians in a better light."
2,Have read better,"I have read Cassie Edwards before, and she has put out a few good books(you just have to find them). She is a writer that you will either like or dislike. I personally like her. However I thought that this particular book was pretty bad. I am part Native American, and I know that mixed marriages DID occur.However, the story line, characters, plot and all thins in between were shallow and uncoordinated in this book. Parts of the book did not need to be there, and yet it was lacking a lot.Sorry Cassie, try again."
1,"Disappointment,weak storyline,amatuerish","I read Cassie Edwards Book Flaming Arrow and liked it very much, so I thought I would give some of her other books a try. I read Bold Wolf first and it wasn't very good or interesting. Lone eagle is written a little better but the story is just plain studid. If you really like Native American Romance read Kathaleen Eagle,Her writing is much better and she is married to a full blooded Lakota Souix.Lone Eagle is written at a level that might appeal to a teen or an adolescent but not an intelligent adult."
4,Dave Aude Rush Hour,one of the most upbeat and nicely mixed hard house album i've ever listened to...progressive beats keep ya going...the first 6 tracks lack what the last 8 tracks have7-12 are prolly the best tracks on the album...13-14 they jus die off a lil...worth checking this album out if u wanna get wild n dance your ... off...
2,"Nice mirror, poorly packed","I ordered this mirror for my family room and was happy to see that it was exactly what I was looking for in size and design. However, when I unpacked the mirror fully, the outer metal frame was dented significantly. I did a return of the mirror for a new one only to find the exact same problem with it. It appears that the mirror is poorly packed from the factory. Amazon did a wonderful job packing the mirror. I had to go with something else since it appeared that this problem would continue. Too bad."
2,Not quite what I expected,"If your looking for a small decorative mirror, it's nice but definitely not worth $100. the metal is thin and flimsy, never hung it still sitting in box."
3,"Nice mirror, some difficulties","This mirror was absolutely perfect for our dining room but two different mirrors were shipped out with a dent in the same place. I contacted Blomus directly to ask if this was a design flaw and they advised that they must be damaged at the warehouse. After mirror number two Amazon would no longer send replacements so we had to order from All Modern and finally received one without the dent. Please note: this is a nice mirror but it is ridiculously prone to fingerprints. Wear gloves when hanging it and hang it out of reach of the little ones as it takes forever to get them off, even with stainless steel cleaner."
2,Greeting card software,I was not happy with this product. Too many discs to install. I had to call tech support for help. They recommended I return it which I did.
3,OK program,"I will be giving this away as I am having difficulties loading it into my computer--but I have an older computer from 2005. It doesn't seem to want to load the program CD, although it reconizes the others. But it looked promising."
4,romance as history,"This book is an admirable example of how literature and history are entertwined. It takes a skillful historian to make sense of two disciplines at once, but Spiegel succeeds. A must-read for anyone interested in historical analysis of texts."
3,noisy nylon,While the pullover itself was nicely constructed and good quality my son hates how noisy and crinkly sounding the nylon is when you wear it...
3,alright,"it was a lot smaller than what i had imagined. it's nice, but not really all that practicle."
2,nice case - cheap interior,"I agree with other reviewers - this is not a quality item. This is basically a very cheap, low quality tape with a nice heavy stainless steel cover. It stopped retracting so I opened it up and found a cheap plastic frame inside. I lubricated the tape and then found if I closed the case tight it still would not retract - so I have to leave the case cover loosely tightened. I very much appreciate well designed and manufactured items - this is not one of them."
1,vido game,"The game came before stated date. Game did play as stated, but the game was not complete, it was a demo, along with other game demos. This was not stated in the game summary. I thought when I purchased the game it was the complete game. I thought about sending it back but it would cost more to send it back."
3,"No the best, but it is okay!","I lobe MB movies, I have all the three , but I did not enjoyed the second one as did with the first, and third."
1,"Unsatisfied Customer, Now Satisfied","I ordered this Lamp in early May and had the cost collected from my Visa Accuunt on May 8th. I had not received the Lamp a month later.Explanations from Ace Hardware Outlets regarding shipping were redirected to my Junk Mail folder and I only found the when I was cleaning up my folders. My apologys to ACE and Amazon for my earlier remarks.I have since received the Lamp and am totally satisfied. It's a great lamp and great value.The shipping problems were at our end and we received it in excellent condition. The system works in following up by ACE Hardware and UPS. I wouldn't hesitate to reccomend this lamp to anyone looking for this stle of reading lamp. It is sturdy, stale and the light emitted is 100% better than any incandescent light we have used and with lower energy require. I'd now give it 5 stars,but the system doesn't permit me to change"
5,Liked them so much I bought two more!,"These lamps look very good, and they are wonderful for reading. I bought two for the living room and liked them so much I looked for two more for the sunroom. I am starting to appreciate how important good lighting is for reading. It makes a big difference!"
5,I am RHONDA from the 7th Layer of YARR!!!!,"""There is NO extras!!! wwwwaaaaahhhhhhh""The above statement is rubbish, not in the sense that there are extras on this volume of THE BRAK SHOW, but in the fact that this show is hilarious enough on its own that it easily gets away without having to have the extras. I loved the volume 1 of THE BRAK SHOW as much as everyone, but I had been more eagerly awaiting the volume 2 as it is the one that houses my favorite episode of this side splitting SPACE GHOST ""spoof-off"" (yeah...I made that last word up, but it fits doesn't it?) the episode in which I refere to of course is THE DINNER PARTY!!!I have already watched this episode about 20 times since I bought the DVD about a week ago, and it gets funnier everytime! Not that THE DINNER PARTY is the only worth while episode on the set. As well their are the bound to be classic episodes as SEXY NEW BRAK SHOW GO, SPLAT and FEUD that make this DVD set a perfect closure to THE BRAK SHOW series!"
3,Please enter a title for your review,"The only reason less than 3 hours of content is spaced out over two discs is to justify a higher price tag. The writing on this volume, including episodes parodying spy movies, daytime soaps, and one which is mostly a bitter tirade agaisnt mainstream media, is generally more weird and random and less clever than on volume 1. I actually like Mom's british accent/dialogue though. I didn't even notice that it was different to the first volume until I saw other reviewers pointing it out, so if the original voice actress did anything distinctive it clearly didn't register with me."
2,Disappointing,"No extras, missing the New Year's Eve Special, and there's really no reason this had to be on 2 DVD's. Especially disappointing considering how good Volume 1 was. Seems like it was just thrown together, and put out quickly to get the show out of Adult Swim's hair."
5,Yeah Buddy!,"in my opinion, this still stands as one of the best series ever produced by cartoon network. the writing andvoice performances are among the finest of any animated series. it's a shame that andy merrill got tired of doing the show. i would have liked to have seen these characters go on to greater hights of craziness.next to brak and his family, the simpsons and the southpark gang are just kind of bland. i'll take freeformwierdness over social commentary any day. YEAH BUDDY!"
3,More short story . . .,"One of the comments on the back cover says it pretty aptly: ""A compassionate, shattering character study, more short story than play."" This is basically a 30-page monologue by one of the characters, with an occasional interjection by the other. It centers around the feelings of Erie (the main character) for the previous night clerk at the hotel where he lives (Hughie), who has died. I found it hard to really like Erie, and I was disappointed with the sudden transformation of the new Night Clerk at the end. However, it has to be said that this play would be great for choosing a monologue for acting class or an audition."
2,Cross between a bad old skool HP and purple prose erotica,"Sadly there was real potential here but no follow through. The H was an abusive, domineering, rapist nematode and the h was just tstl and a doormat besides. The H has a huge betrayal at the end of the book and instead of being arrested for assault and served with a restraining order, he gets off scot free. The h's so called friends turn to out to be more damaging than any enemy and loose ends are left all over the place. There is no reconciliation scene and all in all this book represents the very worst in the old skool Harlequin Presents and the very worst of bodice ripper purple prose. There is plenty of emo angst drama, but no satisfactory resolution or HEA. Read it to get your angst fix but don't count on any reconciliation scene enjoyment or a believable HEA."
5,Excellent Kitchen Scissors,"After accidentally throwing away a pair of kitchen scissors that had served me well for years, I ordered the Fiskar scissors from Amazon which then outsourced the order to Ace Hardware, causing a short delay in delivery. The price was right though and, as it has turned out, the quality is excellent, much better than other kitchen scissors that actually cost more. They have performed every task that I have asked of them and remained sharp and ready. I am also especially pleased that the scissors can be so easily disassembled for cleaning."
5,The Best Kitchen Scissors,"Like many other reviewers, I love these scissors. They are very sturdy, sharp, easy to clean... the list goes on and on. I love that they come apart and can go in the dishwasher, especially after I've cut raw meat with them. They will cut absolutely anything. They are terrific kitchen scissors."
5,Why buy two?,I am buying another one. One for the kitchen the other for my truck. I am an avid hunter. My first one doesn't come apart so I guess I have owned it for more birthdays than I want to figure up. After a dove shoot we get together and clean the birds. This if from 80 to over 300 birds. I use the scissors to cut off both wings until my fingers get tired then the next person takes over. I would not guess how many thousands of wings these scissors have have cut off. Cut off the feet of rabbits and squirrels with ease. Cannot tell these scissors are any duller now than when I bought my first pair. Money well spent.
5,Simplest and best I have had,I have had a number of kitchen shears lately. I ran across the reviews and saw that this item got a good score. I thought it might be too small but ordered it anyway. Right off the bat it was obvious the Fiskars worked better than any I had. It consists of two pieces of steel with handles that can be completely separated for instant cleaning. It must be the careful design that makes them far superior to others I have used.
2,Wish they would last longer,Purchased November 2011 for my wife. After 12 months the knurled nut that holds the 2 halves of the scissors stripped. Apparently it is teflon coated. The scissors no longer stay together.This should never happen
4,Small but mighty,"We ordered these when my husband decided to run our others through the electric knife sharpener thus ruining them. These shears are sharp. However, they would be difficult to use with normal size hands. Luckily, I have carnie hands so it works out. These shears are not quite if or tough enough to handle larger projects like cutting apart a chicken; however, they are very handy for small projects around the kitchen."
1,Description and picture is not accurate,I received my kitchen shears today and they do not appear to be the same as what is pictured and described on Amazon. The blades are extremely short. Too short to do the kitchen tasks described in the reviews. Since the product reviews are all several years old my guess is that the item has changed. Amazon needs to update the picture and the product descpription to accurately reflect the product. Otherwise you will be disappointed.
1,"Not as pictured (Made in China, not U.S.A.)","The ones in the picture are stamped U.S.A. The ones I received are made in China. If you can't find any made in U.S.A. Fiskars, try to find the Fiskars Finest scissors which are made in Finland. Those are some of the best scissors around. Don't bother with their newer made in China crap."
2,Some of Baldry's songs are great,"This collection explained to me why Long John is not exactly a rock icon, or any other kind of icon for that matter. The music was very ordinary and not very ""catchy"". I consider this purchase a waste of money. I really like rhythm and Blues. I also like a mixture of folk and Rock. This album did not fall into that category - either one. Poor old Long John was just another ""one or two hit wonder""."
2,not a toggle switch,"Works fine,not as shown,a rocker switch,not a toggle switch,stickers hard to remove."
1,NOT not a toggle switch,Everyone is after the toggle switch as shown.But that's not what you get. You get a rocker switch (that no one wants).
4,Vivaldi's Variety,"This disc gives the lie to the cliche that Vivaldi wrote the same concerto six hundred times. This isn't simply a matter of the great variety of instruments serving as soloiists (one concerto boasts a group of soloists including a violin, two hunting horns, two oboes, and timpani!). In Fabio Biondi, Vivaldi finds a performer and conductor whose own inventiveness complements that of the composer's. The spaciousness of the recording adds to the alluring sounds produced by Europa Galante, even in the all-strings concerto for four violins (not the familiar B minor Concerto that Bach transcribed in his Concerto for Four Harpsichords, but an equally arresting work.) All in all an exuberant and entertaining disc, although even with such variety I can only enjoy Vivaldi one concerto per hearing."
2,I'm glad I discovered Exodus Quartet here ..................,"There is probably something for everyone here, but most of it is for someone other than me. My standout is ""Our Man In Havana"" by Exodus Quartet. This track fortuitously introduced me to their excellent album ""Way Out There"". Listen to the samples for that before making a decision about this."
5,dope shirt,"The graphic on this shirt is awesome but, it is pressed on so you may want the flip it inside out when you wash it. It shipped quick too, cant ask for much more than that!"
2,Worked fine while they lasted,"These pruners worked OK until yesterday when I snapped off the bottom blade when trying to cut through a rose bush branch. Albeit it was a big branch, but snapping in half with only one hand, I must have ate my spinach today."
1,Do not buy...Junk!,Lower blade snapped in half after cutting 3 different stems. Contacted Corona customer service and I never got a response back. I returned these clippers and got a set of Fiskars instead. They have worked flawlessly
5,Re-charge your passions,"Re- charge your passions. A good material to read, practical advised. My husband & I, read the book & both discovered the new explicit tactics described it. Go ahead & break the monotony!! Have fun & re-charged your passions."
2,Catching salmon with a spinning reel?,Pretty non exciting video. Spends the first half showing you a glacier and letting the first guide give a 5 minute sales pitch on his particular lodge. Duck hunts for a few minutes and misses. If you want to see someone stand on a bank and catch salmon with a spinning rod and reel this might be for you. No flyfishing here. I didn't think much of them kicking the fish back into the river. Interesting release proceedure. The video didn't make me want to go..it made me wish they hadn't gone.
2,Poor quality,Poor quality/workmanaship. Overpriced for the bad quality. I bought this sheet set as a gift to go along with a massage table. There was a rip in the seam on the sheet/pillow cover. This was embarrassing and it is such a hassle to return online purchases.
3,"feel great, but not that durable","These sheets feel great and do the trick, but the elastic came undone on one end of the fitted sheet pretty quickly (after one or two washes). I'll probably look for something similar to replace the current set bit likely won't buy these again."
2,The quality of this order is much much worse than my privious orders!,"I ordered same products from amazon many times in the past and was very happy! But this time was disappointed! The products were much thinner and the quality is completely different though looks are same! The new one even thinner than the ones I used for more than two years that washed so many times if put them together!I hope the seller could control more for the quality of products, so I will continue to order from you!"
4,Comfortable sheet for massage bed,Sheets set was very nice; nothing over the top or special but very nice for the price. This is our first purchase of this sort so we don't have anything to compare it to. All in All very pleased with purchase.
3,Good Quailty,A little narrow so the amrs feel crowed on the larger customers . And by all means do not kneel on the arm support under the head rest as i did acidentily as the tigs that hold it on will snap like dry spagetti. LOl The product was very adiquait and well put together other than the arm rest which I have not fortified and it holds nicely. Weight and portability are good so a thumbs up from me!
1,Amber Spa 17,"Its a waste of money. Had to get rid of the set after the first wash. The fitted sheets did not fit after the wash, the headboard sheets did not fit either. Will never buy again."
2,low quality sheets,"Total waste of money.I washed the sheets before using them and they didn't hold up very well.They are ""pilly"" after one wash!I would not buy them again - I'm looking for better quality sheets now."
2,Sheet set,The material is soft and thick . The fitted sheet is not big enough to cover a table that has a sheepskin cover over it. It's also too small to cover the face rest.
3,"Okay, but not great","These sheets were pretty good. They fit the table, but beaded up on the first wash, as it what happens on flannel sheets. If you are looking for something really soft that will take wash after wash, go for cotton, not flannel."
4,This should be required!,"I found this set to be of high quality and really it's necessary if you want your massagee to be comfy. I really like this set and if you are buying your own table for home, you *really* need this and an electric warmer. I just wish that the sheets were a bit thicker (warmer) and that there were two flat sheets so you can keep all but your target area covered."
5,Exceeded my expectations,"These were a lot softer than I was expecting. They truly had the feel of something you'd feel at a spa. Bear in mind, they are flannel, so while not stifling, they are probably best suited when a warming affect is desired. If used in a hot area, the flannel may be a bit too warm.I was worried that the round piece for the headrest would not be a good fit for my table, but it has an elastic end to it so it can accommodate variations in size, ended up fitting mine perfectly."
3,Heavier cloth needed,It is better than laying a sheet out but the product could be helped with a heavier cloth. Haven't had issues with tears or falling apart in washer.
4,Flannel 3 piece sheets/Master Massage Table,These sheets are great. They are very soft right away. You don't have to wash them a million times. I would recommend that in the future they be a darker color though. White just shows the oil stains to quickly.
3,Decent sheets,Would purchase again if the price was 60% of what I paid. After washing they seemed to be a little thin for flannel.
2,Shrunk!,The flannel sheets were great until we washed and dried them. Now the fitted sheet barely will go on the table!
3,Full Disclosure on laundry care,The sheets are average quality and are at least soft. I was a little disappointed to see that they can't by dried by a dryer. Hang dry only! This is something you may want to know if you don't have an outside cloths line or your neighborhood restricts them.
2,They Shrink...,"They shrank when I didn't follow directions and put them in the dryer. I couldn't believe the laundry instructions were ""for real"". Who lets a sheet air dry these days? Where is the clothes line any way? Unless you are fortunate enough to still own one, don't buy these sheets. The top sheet and the the face ""thing-ee"" survived the dryer but the fitted sheet is smaller now."
2,nice quality,"Beautiful quality of flannel, but they do not fit the table they were recommended for. They are too small and pop off everytime a person moves on the table."
3,i love flannel,"sheets are soft and cozy, the face cover doesn't give enough room to go over extra padding though, same for sheets, we use our table at home only and not for pro use so this doesn't matter. we are pleased."
5,Massage table sheet set,These sheets are great. I have washed them several times and they fit perfectly and still feel like new.
5,Keeps the table clean,Nice flannel sheets that keep body oils and dirt from contacting the table. Easy to put on the table and feels great.
3,"Not the best, not the worst","These were shipped quickly and I like the color. My clients say ""ooh soft"". Like other reviews, the fitted sheet is very small. I can hardly keep it on my bed and it will not fit over a sheepskin bed liner, or anything of that size. Good for a smaller table or a beginner set. Beware, these will absolutely shrink!"
2,Piano memories,"The music is wonderful but on the first song, a short ways from the beginning, the music becomes slurred and repetitive. At no other time does it do this. My comment would be to ask if I could get this CD replaced? Thank you."
2,"no commentary whatsoever, disappointing","Sadly, I can only give two stars to ""A Year with C. S. Lewis: Daily Readings"". The quotes are wonderful, but anyone can peruse CS Lewis books and find quotes; in fact, most people can find his quotes papered all over the Internet; I recommend doing so. I think what I was looking for in this purchase, was some commentary on the quotes. First, to CS Lewis, what surrounded him writing the passage in whichever book, poem or essay? how can I apply this quote to my daily life? A book of daily readings should give you a commentary that helps you go about your day. This one offers none."
1,A Year with C.S. Lewis,I have been readung daily meditations/modivational readings for as long as I can remember. I find this this is probably the most useful in that it covers all aspects of one's life. I find myself unconsciously nodding my head as I read. I would highly recommend this book to all of my friends. It is amazing how much better your day is when you get your brain primed early in the day.
1,"Context, Baby","I love CS Lewis' writings and think it would do one good to read him regularly. He has a great way of breaking things down without dumbing them down. I also love the fact that he makes a distinction between what he knows and what is his opinion.That said, this is proof that even Brother Jack needs context to be worth much. His writing lose meaning or take on different meanings with the help of the compiler's daily ""titles"" for the passages. I would recommend one just read the original writings.I planned to read this daily and made it about two weeks in. Not due to lack of discipline, but rather lack of interest in the abreviated, ripped out of context snipets."
5,One of my favorite devotional books,"Although C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite theologians, some of his books are a bit hard to read. This little devotional book pulls wonderful excerpts from a variety of his works. I tag-teamed checking this book out with another library patron, so I finally decided to get my own copy. I'm glad I did!"
5,Daily Readings,"I have many of C.S. Lewis' books, but not until recently did I know that this book even existed. I really like having a little snippet of his to read every day."
5,Possibility Living: Add Years to your Life and Life to your YEars with God's Health Plan,"If anyone is looking for a Christian book that contains about God's Health Plans, this is the book to read. It just doesn't cover fruits and vegetables, but on life itself, including stress, chiropractor, loving others and most of all, becoming a healthier person to live up to the age of 125! Get this book, you will be glad you bought it."
4,Paul Potts delivers,"After I saw Paul Potts on the YouTube video, I ordered his CD. He definitely delivers on his first CD, which I am sure will not be his last. I especially love his version of Music of the Night from Phantom of the Opera. This is not all opera, in fact, maybe only 25 percent. It is a very enjoyable CD and makes me smile each time I listen to it."
5,"Paul Potts ""One Chance"" CD","I was so thrilled to see this young man win the Britain Has Talent contest, and couldn't wait for his first CD to come out. One of the CDs that I purchased was for a friend and we have thoroughly enjoyed the CD. I think mine is almost worn out already. I sincerely wish this very humble young man a tremendous future and look forward to seeing ""Paul Potts"" name in lights for many years to come.Sincerely,Shirley"
4,100th reviewer,Rather rushed debut outing but well worth a listen.As a Welshman I wished he would have included a version of `Sach o Gachi` but hopefully next time.
3,"Great tallent, not so great CD","There is no doubt - Paul Potts has a great gift and a potential to make history. I just hope he finds a good teacher and stops listening to Pavarotti. Nothing against Maestro, I just think that Paul Potts' worst songs are the ""Pavarotti songs"", i.e. Nesun Dorma. The technique is so bad it hurts my ears to listen. Yes I get goosebumps listening to it, but at the same time, I find it annoying. Personally, I think the best song on the CD is ""Time to Say Goodbye"". Paul sings it briliantly. And then - what's with the accent, or pronounciation? Isn't he British? He also tends to separate his consonants, almost where it sounds like he is saying Nesun-a-Dorma, for example. Why is the ""l"" so ""soft"" in ""Beautiful""? Once again, it hurts my ears...I think I'd rather go back to YouTube and watch his audition video over and over again - it gives me more plasure than this CD."
5,We Love This Man!,"My wife watched the UTube videos and, time after time. wept like a baby! The voice of Paul Potts obviously gets to the very depth of her being. She couldn't wait to get his CD, which I've now heard, and I must admit that I agree with her view that Paul has something very special to offer all music lovers. Paul said he felt that he was born to sing, and we think he's right. His obvious talent and love of singing comes across loud and clear in his beautiful voice, intonation, and depth of feeling. What he delivers on this debut CD has the ability to reach one's soul. Paul Potts is the real thing. His wonderful voice will only get better with time and professional training, and he has what it takes to go all the way to the fulfillment of a career in music. We love this humble man's music, and we will be on the lookout for future CDs, hopefully containing the arias he loves and performs so well."
5,"For a man who has had minimal training,",this guy has an amazing voice. I bought this CD and I still get chills every time I listen to it. It's BEAUTIFUL - you'll see!
4,Paul Potts - One Chance is very nice,"I first saw Paul Potts on Youtube when he performed on Britian's Got Talent Show. His rendition of Nessun Dorma brought tears to my eyes. His new CD is very nice and holds the listener's attention much better than a traditional opera CD. This music mixes opera with several more contemporary songs and blends several languages. I can't imagine anyone, who has a true love of all music, wouldn't love this CD."
5,Paul Potts!! Taking the world by storm!,"Paul Potts, previously unknown, has been taking the world by storm from the first moment he started singing Opera on Brittan's got Talent!! His voice gave me chills the first time I heard it and continues to do so every time I play his CD, ""One Chance"". Some are comparing him to Pavarotti, I think Potts may be a younger version. His voice is much more alive and vibrant than the later Pavarotti--I do like Pavarotti, by the way. If you're looking for something wonderful to listen to, this is the CD for you, even if you don't care for opera! His voice makes you forget the song you're listening to isn't in English. There are some songs that are a combination of Italian and English."
5,Exceeds expectations!,"Yes, I watched the youtube videos of the amazing ""Britain's got talent"" series of appearances. And I ordered the CD with minimal expectations -- whice were quite exceeded! While not expecting (or receiving) technical perfection, I feel thsi album ranges from the technically adequate to the emotionally sublime. ""Nessun Dorma"" still raises the goosebumps - perhaps becase it always brings those TV appearances to mind. Then there are the wonderful surprises, like ""Music of the Night"" which is astonishing in its nuance. No flash in the pan, this one! I hope we will be privileged to enjy years and years --- and albums and albums - of this amazng artist's development!"
5,I've Died and gone to heaven!,"This mans voice is angelic! I'm a 46 year old male who has been reduced to tears when listening to this. Mr. Potts has been able to combine music styles from different genre's into a wonderful first release. After listening to tenors/artists of recent years and the present, this man sings with a warmth and conviction which is seemingly lacking in many artists. From his beautiful rendition of CAVATINA (amazing) AMAPOLA (soothing) to the more common NESSUN DORMA, there's something for everybody here. The only Track which didn't appeal to me was MY WAY. I've never had a CD/release where I could find the vast majority of the songs on it entered in my REPEAT button on my player. Simply wonderful! I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I have."
5,Phenomenal!,"I am not an opera fan, but Paul Potts has such a magnificent voice that I enjoy listening to this CD over and over and..."
5,Paul Potts is the real thing,"a real person who is shy, has an average job selling mobile phones, and possesses average looks. All of the above adds to the magic of this CD. With his soaring and beautiful voice, Potts conveys emotion, longing, and a lifetime of dreams. He only had one chance - and it was competing on the show ""Britain's Got Talent"". Thankfully for the rest of us, his dreams were realized.I loved this compilation of Italian opera favorites, including Nessun Dorma and Con Ti Partire. I also loved The Music of the Night and Cavatina. I find myself longing for the end of the day so I can listen to this ordinary man with the heavenly voice sing once again."
5,Beautiful!,Paul Potts is really good and this CD has a good variety of sounds. I'm ready for his next one.
4,Decent try,"Decent first try of Paul Potts to enter the world of clasic music and opera. He should choose some more great operas to sing, rather than known songs. Anyway, it worths buying it..."
4,Very enjoyable,"I enjoy listenting to Paul Potts. The CD is very good, not exceptional, but very good. He has an easy voice to listen to."
5,Evocative and heartfelt,"I believe his Ognuno Soffre is the most gripping foreign-language cover of a pop song I can imagine. Everybody Hurts is a song I can imagine Paul having taken comfort in, as he watched his dreams dashed before the reversal of fortune his talent provided him on Britain's Got Talent."
4,lovable thoughts,this is one performance a person should buy to enjoy the flavor of light opera and some enduring love songs from broadway musicals. mr. potts voice is enchanting and so very pleasing to the ears. he even shows his talent on some arranagements by singing in a foreign language charm that is highly exhilitering.......i positively recomend this one for your collection.
5,Speechless,"I have only heard of Paul Potts recently and believe me I don't live in a box, at least not when it comes to music and books. I saw his audition for British Idol on youtube and was blown away. It gave me chills just listening to him. The fact that he is just your average person with no classical training is what I think draws the masses to his humble nature. Frankly I don't care that other reviewers think that he needs more polishing in his voice. The miracle that he can now be heard around the world is his triumph."
3,the inevitible letdown,"I expected it, and it happened. It had to after the initial thrill of the first Pucinni performance. I don't want to be negative, but the Paul Anka/Frank Sinatra/I Did It My Way is just not the same, even with Potts singing. So I have the CD, and I'm glad I bought it. I will listen to it from time to time, but nothing will ever be the same as that night and Nessun Dorma (sp) and that voice and the so expressive facial expressions of the judges and members of the audience. Where will we be a year from now? Without Pavarotti I fear, if nothing else. I just pray Potts can keep his head."
2,Paul Potts CD,"He obviously has a delightful voice, but he's also obviously an amateur. Even with orchestration so close to Il Divo's (and that was a cheap shortcut in my estimation) it wasn't enough to hide the fact he should spend a good solid year with a voice coach before he decides he's professional. It's an enjoyable CD but I wasn't impressed enough to play it very often."
2,"Nice, but I feel Exploited & Manipulated","I was moved to tears during the youtube video, so ordered the CD. After listening to the CD, I feel a bit exploited and manipulated. There's something about him that touches your heart. Maybe it's his vulnerability we all relate to. But the CD songs didn't come close to pulling out any emotions in me. They're nice, just not great. There's hardly any variation of phrasing or volume. He just belts out one song after another, and they try to help him along with a big orchestra sound. I'm not a music expert, but even I can tell this is mediocre."
2,two for effort,"I am so very disappointed. It feels like his soul has been stolen. No neckhairs standing up at the first sound, no goosebumps, nothing. Just disappointment. Not about his voice that is obviously not there yet, but it is still sweet to listen to, but for the very poor choice of songs, the much too loud orchestra, and Christmas songs???? Christmas is only one day a year, who wants to listen to that the whole year long? But okay, Paul I'm so sorry that you were exploited just to make a cd real fast so that it could be ready for Christmas. I'm sorry that they took your soul and your spirit with these flat songs. I want to hear you LIVE, ALIVE, I want to feel what I felt when I heard you for the first time, touching MY spirit with yours. That is what made you win, and that is what you are here for, to touch people's spirits, to soothe and comfort them. Don't let others tell you what to record, don't lose yourself in commerce, and above all, never record anything like this ever again."
5,Breathtakingly beautiful,"I first heard of Paul Potts when I was given a You Tube link. I am completely unfamiliar with this type of music. I thought I was losing my mind when chills danced up my spine and tears came to my eyes as he sang. It was only after reading online that I realized Paul's voice has the same effect on many people.The CD came today...I have no idea what he is saying, who else has sang the most of the songs....I just know is voice is breathtakingly beautiful. I am amazed that I bought anything having to do with opera...and that I did is a testament to Paul.And in response to something he said in one of his videos...Yes, Paul, you are someone. Someone magnificent!"
4,Great first CD,"I liked most of the tracks on this CD - mostly the operatic arias. If you enjoyed seeing Paul Potts on ""Britain's Got Talent"", then I'd recommend buying this CD."
5,Paul Potts One Chance,"Mr. Potts does not need ""One Chance"" since he has already arrived and will be here to stay. His voice is so gentle and melodic and a pleasure to listen to. He does show his lack of experience in his performance in some songs where he could have expressed a little more passion in his presentation but his musical talent is amazing. I'm sure he will develop his very special gift and style of presentation with time."
5,He's simply fabulous!,I first saw the YouTube video of his audition on TV before Simon Cowell and others in England. I was blown away as were the judges and audience. When I saw that he had a CD I ordered right away. It's wonderful. I was amazed that I found him to be as good as Michael Crawford singing from Phantom!
5,Paul Potts gets his One Chance,"Paul Potts is solely responsible for bringing opera to the attention of the ""every man"".From the moment he sings the first note of Nessun Dorma he has hooked us all. The every day guy with the beautiful voice.The CD is really good.When Potts sang on Britain's Got Talent he reached every member of the audience. They cheered, they cried, they rose and they all felt the same emotion: pure joy. The CD does not disappoint."
4,We liked it,I have a son who loves to sing along with anyone singing opera. This has been an inspiration for him. Yes people do love a good voice put to wonderful music. We have enjoyed the whole story o Paul Potts.
5,Potts Pleasure,"New to opera before and now, I'm delightfully hooked to listening to this CD. It's easy to listen Paul than its original counterparts. Hard to pick a favorite among all, but ""you raise me up"" stood out for me. I would highly recommend this CD to be in your collection and I look forward to owning more from Paul."
2,It is not Christmas!!,"Paul Potts has a lovely voice---but needs more of a repetoire. To include two Christmas hymns on his CD was not what I was expecting.I would not have purchased this CD if I'd had a chance to listen to it first. I expected more songs, and wish the Christmas songs were not on it.Danielle Garland"
4,Paul Potts is refreshing,Paul Potts sounds so refreshing - having watched Britain Has Talent and hearing of his background makes the music even more special Truly an artist to watch - anxiously await his next album
4,Paul Potts: One chance,"When Paul won the British - you have talent - he seems to be a really down to earth person with a wonderful voice.I hope he will enyoy his new found fame all over the world.A really nice CD to listen and relax with. A nice mixture of songs, classicial and opera. Nice to listen to as background music over a dinner with friends or family."
3,Potts has a lovely voice but...,"I have to admit, I was a little disappointed in the album. I guess I'd hoped for more traditional opera. ""Nessun Dorma"" is wonderfully done, but I was not impressed with the operatic renditions of jazz standards. The holiday songs at the very end are beautiful also, but as a total package, the CD just leaves me lukewarm."
4,He deserved to win,A strong debut. It will be fun to see where he expands -- pop tenor or operatice performances.
5,First Chance.,Everyone deserves a first chance and Paul Potts should never have to go back to his day job!!
5,Amazing voice,"This man has the most amazing voice (very smooth) and what a story! I just love the CD and am planning on buying 2 more for stocking stuffers. I wish him much success and hope he has another CD out soon. I am NOT an opera fan, but love this CD just because of Paul's beautiful voice!"
5,Amazing........,His voice is so clear. O Holy Night is tingling! My Nain would have loved his voice. She was from Wales and she could sing with the best!I will be watching for more.
5,Excellent !!!!,These CD's were wonderful....one was for me and one as a gift. Paul Potts' voice is phenomonal and we are greatly enjoying him. The delivery service on this order was also just great!
5,Paul Potts cd,"The voice of Paul Potts is one of the most beautiful and easy to hear again, and again. You will want this cd for your car and one for your home..and one for your best friend...!!"
4,Sentimental voice,"Nice songs and a very beautiful voice with sentiment, which differs from the known tenors like pavarotti and carreras."
4,Not bad for a first outing!,"Look, just go to Youtube and watch his videos on his winning performances in the United Kingdom gameshow. This guy's got heart and talent. Ok, maybe the London Symphony Orchestra that is behind his voice on this CD sounds a little bit mechanical, but hey it's a live orchestra. All it needed was the admiring sound of his fans in the audience. But surely the smart guys in the studio know Paul Potts' magic is in a live production. Let this CD start you're collection."
5,One Chance by Paul Potts,My husband listened to this C.D. three days straight when we received it. He really enjoyed it.
5,Amazing Voice,"I am certainly not an opera buff, but I saw Paul Potts on the Oprah Show and ordered this CD. FANTASTIC!!!! He has one of the most naturally beautiful voices I've had the pleasure of hearing. He just might make a convert of me! I highly recommend this CD to anyone who might be an expert in this genre or a novice like myself."
5,FABULOUS!!!!!,"I can't believe this guy was hiding in the middle of middle class world selling cell phones with the voice of an angel. I'm not really an opera officianado, but once I heard his amazing voice I had to hear more. I could've gone with out the 2 bonus tracks, since they're Christmas songs, but the tracks were soul inspiring and beautiful."
4,PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! [4-1/2 stars],"I was first introduced to Paul Potts from a YouTube link that was sent to me by a friend. I thought he had a really nice voice and decided to take a gamble buying his CD.For the most part, I have found the CD to be very enjoyable -- and one that grows on you with each listen. While Paul Potts' voice isn't as technically developed as -- say -- Pavarotti's, Placido Domingo's or even Daniel Rodriguez's -- and while his English pronunciation isn't perfect --what he may lack in professional technique, he makes up for with passion, emotion and sincerity.His voice is clear and pure -- and he doesn't give into needless embellishments -- but even more, it touches the emotions of the human heart and soul. Among the standouts: ""Nessun Dorma,"" ""Time to Say Goodbye (Contepartirò),"" ""You Raise Me Up (Por Ti Seré)"" and ""Nella Fantasia.""If you want a pleasantly dramatic voice to listen to in the car, or relaxing by a warm fire on a cold evening, then this is the CD for you!"
5,Absolutely Gorgeous,"I love this CD. The back story and the YouTube video helped create part of the emotional response to paul Potts and his music, but his voice is glorious, touching and mahical. Additionaly, I like all the music choices on the CD...it's a great find."
5,He touched my soul,I am thankful that I can listen again to a voice infused with soul touching Divinity. There are angels that walk amoung us.
5,Sensational new talent - as good as the 3 Tenors or Caruso,"A fresh new operatic voice, Paul Potts even sings old favorites (""I Did It My Way"") in Italian. Christmas carols, famous arias - - you name it -he sings them all with a rich, clear voice, hitting even the very highest notes and holding them longer than one would think possible!!!"
3,Lost in the mail,"Unfortunately this product was lost in the mail. I was able to get one sent out after your customer Service responded to my ""Where is it"" question.Otherwise you guys are the best. I have formally ""resigned"" from Overstock in your favour!"
3,A unique talent,"When I saw the inital performance of Paul Potts on television, I was so impressed that bought this CD...to be honest, I'm a bit disappointed. Overall, while his voice is impressive, it's not as polished an instrument as I'd hoped to hear. His personal story is compelling and he's very 'down to earth.' He will definitely be launched now on his career -- not sure that he's going to be 'top tier.' Perhaps it's a mistake for him to be singing pieces closely associated with Luciano Pavarotti - whose recent death had tv/radio stations playing his best-known pieces...the inevitable comparison shows that Potts is not at LP's level."
3,"Potts Sings Well, Too short",The CD took FOREVER to arrive and I have no idea why. I called post offices and wrote amazon. Amazon responded well and offered to refund my money. Then the cd arrived. I think that experience of waiting almost 3 weeks took the joy out of the purchase. The music is good but so short. I think 11 songs and they are all quite short. Oh well. Potts is a great singer and I wish him all the best.
2,Disapointment,"Although the sample track I listened to was impressive, the rest were very mediocre, with orchestration that drowned out his voice."
2,Not what it's hyped up to be.,"Well, he blew me away on YouTube, as well as everyone else, so I was anticipating this album. Unfortunately, Simon didn't do a good job of choosing Paul's songs. This album isn't very interesting. The more I listen to it, the less I like it. A real disappointment, and, sadly for Paul, probably a flash in the pan."
3,Good first CD,"Parts of the CD are quite nice, parts show the flaws of a first CD. The story of his ""Britain's Got Talent"" success prompted me to buy it in the first place. I suspect the company that produced the CD did so on the economy plan, which is unfortunate for Potts. Still, his talent shows through. Even if it is not the best CD I ever bought, it is still worth it to support him. I look forward to his future, hopefully more polished, releases. He really does have a wonderful voice."
3,Pretty good,"I really enjoy the first few pieces, the middle not so much and I sing along with O Holy Night. All in all a pretty good CD."
5,Smoothest Tenor Ever,I first heard Paul Potts at the home of a friend (voice teacher) on her video of Britain's Got Talent. I was spellbound. He has the smoothest and most beautiful tenor voice I've ever heard and I've purchased his first two CDs from Amazon. Very few days go by that we miss listening to them. I wish he would make a CD of classical hymns and Irish ballads.
3,"Beautiful, but could have been better","Paul Potts' story is certainly inspiring. However, this CD must be judged on it's own merits, apart from the ""backstory"".First, the positive: His tone and control of his voice is awe-inspiring. The range of his singing sends chills up my spine. He really shows that the human voice can be trained to perform as the most beautiful musical instrument available.Unfortunately, I think this effort could have been better. For one thing, almost every word is sung in Italian. As I don't speak Italian, I would have preferred English lyrics. Also, as noted by other reviewers, the mixing and sound quality on this CD leaves something to be desired. No doubt the producers were in a hurry to rush this CD out to take advantage of Potts' win on ""Britains Got Talent"", a British ""American Idol"" style competition.Overall, it is a worthy effort, but with the right production, his next could be so much more."
5,Paul Potts CD,"Absolutely incredible voice just when Opera needs someone new. He should have a lengthy career ahead of him and be an equal certainly to Michael Crawford, maybe even Pavarotti. A bright new light in the sky. Highly recommended CD."
5,Beautiful voice & wonderful song selection,"This Paul Potts CD is great. It is a joy to hear him perform classics such as Nessun Dorma and Time to Say Goodbye with perfect pitch, yet gut-wrenching emotion. Such a talent!!"
5,very gifted talent,I loved the cd by Paul Potts. He has amazing talent. It was veryproffessional. He could be the 4th Tenor. Hope to be hearing a lotmore of him.
4,Very talented artist,"I was a little sceptical at first with this whole ""pop idol"" formula behind this artist but I must say that this guy has got talent and the cd is very good. It has some nice variety of songs including a great song from Phantom of the opera."
4,"Paul Potts, One Chance","His first album since winning ""Britain Has Talent"". A cell phone salesman with no formal training who practiced in his bedroom originally as a diversion from being bullied in school. He has a phenominal voice. A gift from heaven. Paul Potts comes at a time when we have lost another phenominal tenor, Luciano Pavarotti. I don't think this is a mere coincidence. We can expect to hear more and more from Paul Potts."
4,Great voice - sell out play list,"I love Mr. Pott's voice. I am only disappointed that he was advised to sing a Josh Groban-type play list. I suspect that whoever advised him felt that an actual emphasis on opera wouldn't sell to the general population that makes up the audience for ""Britain's got Talent"". I look forward to hearing the next CD in which, I hope, he actually sings opera. The quality of his sound is such a relief - I have never been able to understand the attraction of Mr. Groban's warble."
4,Very good!,I am listening to his songs frequently.I am enjoying the growth of Paul.I want him to be a great singer.But I think he needs some more experiences.
5,"Bravo, Paul!!!",When God took away Pavarotti........He knew that He would give us Paul Potts. All I can say to Him is...Thank You.
4,Wonderful listening,Paul Potts is truely a great find in the art world. His voice is inspiring and it will only become better as he sings from his heart to the rest of the world. His love of the music he sings shines through on every note.
5,I love the voice of Paul Potts,"The voice of Paul Potts gives me chicken skin. He really hits the high notes on the tracks ""Nessum Dorma"", ""Caruso"", and ""You Lift Me Up."" His voice is very uplifting. ""Time To Say Good Bye"" is a very pretty song. ""Cavatina"" is a beautiful song. The guitar playing accompanies Paul's subtle vocals nicely here. I also love Paul's rendition of ""Music Of The Night"" from Phantom Of The Opera ""Everybody Hurts"" is a hit song from REM. Paul makes this song his own by giving it a beautiful operatic sound. ""Amapola"" and ""My Way"" are very soothing songs. This is the perfect disc to play after a stressful day and relax to. I love the voice of Paul Potts."
5,Paul Potts,"Paul Potts is to the world of music what Cinderella is to the world of make believe. His voice inspires the average person to recognize the miracle of greatness within the midst of one's undiscovered world. When a voice with the potential of a Luciano Pavarotti steps into the light, something lying in the shadow withn us feels discovered, redeemed and uplifted. Gary Ades Bowker"
5,Fantastic Surprise,"When Paul got on stage for Britain's Got Talent and started singing Nessun Dorma, he gave me chills and the hair on the back of my neck actually stood up. His voice was so incredible and powerful and passionate, that I was glued to the TV, listening to him sing. I was so happy that a few months later Paul put out a CD featuring some of the most beautiful opera I have ever heard. I play it over and over and over in my car and enjoy it every time. The arrangements are not so powerful that they overshadow his voice, and he just soars above the music. I love this CD!!"
5,Paul Potts,I saw Paul's performance on internet.. and absolutely loved his performance. I then ordered his CD and I just love it. I am not a tremendous fan of Opera.. but I just love to listen to his voice.
5,Stunning!,A friend introduced me to Mr. Potts via YouTube... I pre-ordered the CD upon first hearing. Fabulous!!
5,A Winner!,"I received the CD Monday and can't stop playing it. Surprisingly I think my favorite song is Everybody Hurts. All are so, so beautiful. Can't wait for the next CD!"
5,Blown Away,I saw him on the Today Show after he had won. I had a chance to listen to the voice of an Angel. I can't wait till he does another CD.
5,opera for everyone,"I am a fan of all types of music so when my sister sent me a link on YouTube for the Britain's got talent, I was blown away. Paul Potts is destined to become a legendary opera star. His singing brought tears to my eyes as well as my 6'5"" tall 290 lb 24 year old son. I bought the CD for myself as well as a Christmas gift for my son. Even those who are not familiar with opera will recognize a few of the tracks on this CD sung in Italian, of course. Start your education in opera with this CD. It won't disappoint."
5,paul potts,everything he sings on the cd is excellent. just beautiful. waiting for him to record again !!!
5,One Chance,"What a magnificent voice this man has. A shy, humble man from great Britain, fills our home with a strong, beautiful tenor's tone. I enjoy this CD very much. I feel you will too if you enjoy classical opera. I give this CD a 'thumbs-up'!"
5,AWESOME DEBUT CD,My uncle sent an e-mail containing his clip on Britain's Got Talent. Paul Potts has got a tremendous gift!
3,Paul Potts - One Chance,"Like many people, I saw Paul Potts as a video on YouTube when he was on Britain has Talent. I was very impressed with his voice, and immediately bought the CD. Sadly, the CD was a disappointment - not due to Paul Pott's voice, but instead due to the very poor producer. The choice of songs, and the bizzare need to to sing most all of them in a language, other than English, eludes me. Since ""My Way"" was hugely successful in this country in English, why would you record it only in Italian and not both Italian and English? The producers should get a copy of a new CD by Carlos De Antonis; ""del Cuore,"" and listen to it. The orchestrations on the ""One Chance"" album are thin, and Paul Potts is not the greatest acappella voice out there. I realize that this is his first effort, but his producers didn't do him any favors with this poor showcase of his beautiful voice."
5,CD,"This CD is excellent, I heard he was discovered by Simon ""American Idol"" and who am I to disagree with Simon? If you like Classical music you'll love this CD"
3,Paul Potts sings opera.,"I was looking forward to Paul Potts first CD release and for the most part, it is very enjoyable. The choice of songs could have been better selected as there are a few popular songs mixed in with the operatic pieces. Overall, I enjoy listening to the CD."
2,Hmmmmmm....,"After coming across a review of his CD, and of course reading about his win in the UK's version of 'Idol,' I decided to 'bite' and purchased his CD. I think people are moved by his great passion for singing, as I was, but I think that extensive training would be most helpful in the field that he has chosen. I thought the release of the CD was premature as it relates to his maturity as a singer. I look forward to hearing him in say, five years, after he's had a chance to develop and grow as an artist, and hear his version of 'Nessun Dorma' again."
1,Can't review yet,"Well I would like to tell you about the cd, unfortunately I haven't received it yet. It is now May 29th and the ""estimated"" was May 1, 2009 - May 18, 2009. Amazon keeps sending me links to my email to rate the cd and I'm tired of getting them and deleting them. So hopefully now that I've ""rated"" this product I will stop getting emails about it."
1,A Christmas Gift,"This Christmas I received the Paul Potts' One Chance recording. On the tag was the word ""enjoy!"" Well after listening to the recording, I wasn't sure what the person meant using the word enjoy. Was the person being cynical or just didn't know any better. Mr. Potts is just not a singer. He has a vibrato that leads to pitch problems on any held notes. The phrasing is just not there. And the bombastic orchestra just doesn't help the situation. His intentions I am sure are sincere, however, he needs some training after which, he should get a second chance to do a better recording."
1,Why?,"With so many recordings of the truly great tenors available, why would anyone choose to listen to this untrained, pale, mediocrity? I listened to his Nessun Dorma, thought about Domingo and of course Pavarotti and wanted to cry (and not for joy)."
2,"It really is ""one chance""","Who of us didn't delight at watching our ""everyman"" win hearts and minds as he sang a few of the world's great arias? Charming. Delightful. And we were happy when he won. Now the album. Alas. One listen about wraps it up. Sorry."
2,Paul Potts,"If you are an opera connoisseur/afcionado and have listened to a few good voices and deliveries, this does not measure up. The voice is not ripe and delivery misses the nuances of the actual compositions. It is not important what you do; it is more important how you do it. If you do not improve the composition at least do not bring it down. I still give this product a passing grade. For comparative purposes buy it. And you the mushy nationalists, stop undeserved flattery because you'll bring down the standard of good performance in art."
1,CD has bad spots/will not play without stopping or skipping,CD has bad spots/will not play without stopping or skipping. Very dissappointed. I was looking forward to this item and had it on order for several weeks. It is not enjoyable because it cannot be played without stopping and backtracking.
1,"One Chance, CD, Paul Potts","If you were intrigued by Paul Potts' tryouts on YouTube, this CD will not disappoint you. The man can sing."
1,The incomparable Pavarotti,"I'm not going to give my opinion of this disc by Paul Potts... as you can see, I've rated it as low as it goes, and I have my own reasons... one being, I'm an opera lover. (And I'm not an elitist, just a southern girl that loves opera.)What I will say though is that I've gone through many pages of reviews and noted how often Maestro Pavarotti's name is mentioned, in comparison to Potts or otherwise.And so it is. Luciano Pavarotti is the Gold Standard by which all singers - opera or otherwise are measured. Bravo, Maestro! Long live the King of the high C's!!!"
2,PAUL POTTS NEW RECORD CD,NOT OVERLY IMPRESSED WITH THIS CD. MUSIC IS VERY COMMON AND IS COPIED FROM ANDREA BOCELLI MUSIC..SAME SONGS BUT SUNG IN ITALIAN TO GIVE IT SOME SPIFF. SEEMS THAT ORCHESTRA WAS OVERPOWERING PAUL NOTTS. I HAVE PLAYED IT THREE TIMES AND DETERMINDED IT IS NOT TO MY LIKING.
4,Hals Review of Paul Potts,I enjoy tennors and this CD is great. Paul needs to come out with anothercd soon.
5,Paul Potts' CD Last Chance,"I enjoyed the greatly and I don't listen to a lot of opera. It was exciting to see someone from a common background win BGT. He has a great tenor voice, which will only get better the more he sings. I don't understand the words, I just enjoy the music."
5,Five stars - for what it is it works perfectly,"For me, this timer has worked just like they did many years ago (who hasn't had one of these in their past if they are a certain age, eh?).As others have mentioned, you just have to be sure to always crank it around PAST the 30 minute mark even if you are doing less than 30 minutes. Just go around past the 30 minute mark and go counter-clockwise back to the number of minutes you want. It is just one loud ring but the nice thing about a portable timer is that you can take it in the living room, or whatever, and have it close by so that you can be sure to hear it.I tested it a couple of times, setting a digital timer on my stove at the same time and they both went off at the EXACT same time. To tell the truth, I was surprised. All I expected of it was the it be close but it was right on, so I'm very pleased.FWIW, I have the black one and, well, it's perfectly black so it goes with all my black kitchen stuff. It is not shiny. It is a lovely, satiny black."
1,no ding?,"i was really excited about this product until i got it and tried it out, it didn't ding when the time was up i mean what is the point of a timer that doesn't ding?"
1,Complete Garbage,"Complete Garbage! It rings with 2 minutes to go for a few seconds and when it does get to zero, all hear is a faint... Ding.. I bought this timer for my grilling, but the ring is not loud enough for me to hear it across the room, I have to have it right next to me to hear it..."
3,Many colors come in Lead,"I have always liked this timer. I would have given it 5 stars but it was not made in Connecticut, America or Europe/Scandinavia. Like the ever increasing number of products, you guessed it...""Made in China"". They are trying to kill their people and ours. I'm convinced the reason for all the smooth colors...""Lead""; no prop 65 California label, but not all states are that conscientious. Now, I have to wash my hands almost non-stop. There goes my natural oils. I can't wait to throw all this stuff away. At least we found a clothes iron made in Germany!"
4,Good!,"Good, solid little timer. Ringer volume is a lot better than I expected and I like that. Its wind down movement goes past the zero mark a bit but that is no big problem. I have already dropped it on my kitchen floor (with a solid thud sound) and the little booger keeps right on ticking. Having wasted my money on 2 previous pieces of junk, I am very impressed with this Lux product."
4,Kitchen Timer,Works like it is suppossed to...Just makes a single ding ( I guess I was expecting a few seconds on the ring ) but fairly loud
2,Cheaply made.,Replacement for a timer I bought in 2003. Time (pardon the pun) will tell if this will hold up even half that long.
1,Kitchen Timer,"Unfortunately, many of the folks at Amazon do not know what the device is in the picture. They must only use digital timers which cost twice as much but cost much less to manufacture. The kitchen timer that I purchased is outstanding. It works every time and does not require batteries. It will last for years and will not add to the waste stream with used up batteries.It is not a toy! The rating questions above this dialog consider it a toy.Activity Timer"
1,"This is a timer, not a toy","Gave it a 1 star rating as you were asking me to rate this 'toy' and asked if it was fun, educational, durable. As far as rating the timer, I found it works well and would give it 4 stars."
3,Lightweight,"Upon opening the package, I could tell that this wasn't going to be a heavy duty timer.The color (bronze) is very bright and the material is a thin metal. My first impressions were not good. When trying the timer for the first time, I set it for 5 minutes. It didn't go off until 2 minutes PAST the mark (or at 58 minutes) and then continued ticking, but eventaully stopped. I then dug the packaging from the garbage. The package only has one instruction, 'for short time periods, turn past 30 and then back to desired time.' So, I followed the instruction and it worked better. It did go off at the proper time, but still continued to tick for a minute or so afterward. All-in-all, I'm not that impressed but for the little money I spent, I can't expect miracles."
3,Short ring? I don't think so.,"First of all, this is categorized as a TOY? It's not a toy.Secondly, it says it is ""SHORT RING""??? When was a 5-second long ring SHORT? It's ANNOYING. I've been searching for a timer with simply a single bell *DING* when it rings, not one that sounds like a phone! It's not the fault of the seller, but the manufacturer who refuses to acknowledge that it is NOT SHORT, but long.I gave it to my mother, and she loves it. I'm still searching."
1,Cheap,"I bought same one in a local K-mart - cheap, no back-cover and has a inaudible, ""ding"" at end- of time & if you're kitchen is like mine, the main room in house with a lot of noise/talking go on, you'll burn your cookies. Save your money buy something else."
1,Not accurate...and very loud!,"This timer only rang intermittently when time was up. In addition, it added several minutes on to time being set, so it was hard to get an exact time. The timer is also VERY loud. The ticking can be heard outside the room. That is great if you like to track the sound of the timer, but not so great if you're noise sensitive."
4,Very good for the money,"Very good buy, used about 10 times, (the wife is forgetful sometimes) , works well, loud alarm, satisfied overall, would recommend for basic timer."
1,Item did not work,Did not work right out of the box but it's too much trouble and a cheap item so I din't even bother to return it. It don't think the bell is very loud either.
1,Not worth it,"Product arrived and, right out of the box, wasn't working. The timer dial wouldn't stop at ""0"" - kept going past it. Design, as well, seemed flimsy. Back to the drawing board and trying to find a new kitchen timer!"
5,I love it.,"I like the old fashioned wind-up style and Bell, which is loud. It's easy to read. I do love it!"
3,It works but,I really have no idea why it keeps ticking after the buzzer goes off. It is confusing. Is it time or not? Its good enough though.
2,A mechanical timer with a very little alarm,A mechanical timer with a very little alarm. Why would anyone make or sell such an alarm? It is ridiculous. It costs a little and does very little. So it was a waste of time buying this item and now that I had to review it.
2,Doesn't work like my mom's,"My mom had a Robert Shaw Lux Minute Minder when I was growing up and it was solid and reliable.I bought one of these Lux Minute Minders because I find digital timers annoying (they never seem to be as easy to set as a Minute Minder). I thought this timer would be great like my mom's, but it isn't. Half the time it stops before it reaches zero, and never rings. A timer this unreliable is useless.It also feels cheap and flimsy compared to my mom's. I do like the long ring, but this and its vintage appearance don't offset its erratic performance.I'm going to try to get a real vintage Robert Shaw Lux Minute Minder on eBay, and toss this one in the trash."
1,Do not buy this timer,"This timer is cheaply made and I'm sending it back after a day. It's very flimsy and mine didn't even work out of the packaging. The timer stops at -2 minutes instead of at 0 and the bell doesn't even go of. If this was priced at $2 I might understand, but not at this price. Save yourself the trouble and buy a different product."
2,This one is OK but...BE WARNED!!!,"I had this one for a few years. It was OK. Died before it should have. Four months ago I purchased the Lux QZ100a timer from PUBLIX grocery store. Here I am with a timer that flashes the light but, the minutes don't move and the timer buzzer does not go off. A DEFINATE FIRE HAZZARD!!!!!"
3,tick talk,"While this timer looks good from the front, turn it around and its basically cheap _ _ _ _ from China.Claiming to have and extra long/loud ring; in actuality not so muchOK - what was I expecting for 13 bucks?"
2,Lux mechanical timer is cheap,"Lux timer The timer compared to the old that I sill have weigh's about 1/2. Also the bell is weak and the timer some time doesn't start by it self, even thogh turn it pas 30. You have to give a extra shake to start the timer."
1,Do not buy!,I bought this to replace a defective Lux digital timer I bought through Amazon. This is a hopeless piece of junk with a tiny bell you can't hear across the room. Get yourself somehow to a good hardware store - maybe they have something of a quality they can vouch for.
3,Lux timer,I Love the color however could barely read the numbers.Maybe if they had made the numbers darker or even white it would be better. I ended up giving it to my daughter and buying a vintage pink one!
4,"A solid offering from a great, underappreciated band...","Having been a Paw fan from the start, this release gave me the thrills I was looking for. Growth lyrically & musically are obvious from the lead-in to the lead-out on this disc. The gritty, catchy and naughty ""One Handed..."" is a power track that you'll growl along with, ""Blow Wind"" will leave you remembering an experience you never had and ""Naiad"" will tug at you the way that ""Couldn't Know"" did on Dragline. I'm only luke-warm on ""Oily Rags,"" but only because I've always listened to Paw for Mark Hennessy's voice and not Grant Fitch's. Grant's not a bad vocalist, but he's not the powerhouse that Mark is. Rock & Roll with a hungry edge- that's what Paw will provide you with. Intelligent lyrics about interesting things. No wonder they don't get airplay anymore!Enjoy this offering, there may not be more from these guys... Check out the Paw egroup if you're a fan- info, bootlegs and more for the diehard Paw fan."
4,where are they now?,"PAW, were one of my favourite bands in the 90's. Somehow missed out of the grunge explosion (PAW's vocals give mr vedder a run for his money) Imagine eddie mixed with Mark Lanegan and a ton of agression and country thrown in, and you have an idea (dont let the country put you off.) PAW deserved to be so big. I put them up there with alice in chains, tool etc. Where are they now?? I would love it if they released some new material. back to the review.... this ep is not as strong as their fisrt 2 albums. The songs are awsome, but the production on the vocals dont do them any justice. They kind of sound like early clutch, which isn't a bad thing, just less PAW sounding. so, start off with the 2 lp's, and then top it off with this cd."
5,I want more!,"I haven't heard many C.D's that after you listen to it you think to yourself ""wow"" I only hope that Paw put's out another album because I would be a little [angry] as well quite a few other people as well."
5,astonishing,"Everything's great, from the perfect hitorical recostruction of the ambience to the sonority of the orchestra, the perfect singers and the highly dramatical atmosphere. An astonishing perfomance"
2,Sorry to differ,"Sorry to differ with the other enthusiastic reviewers, but to me this production is stodgy and uninteresting, scarcely more than a costume pageant show. I threw away the dvd that I purchased it was so disappointing."
5,A Living History,"I'm a child of the South and relish Civil War history. This book is just great in all respects. The text is clear and readable, tells the story well, and the maps are wonderful. The book itself is beautifully printed and the pages are substantial. It's a real treasure to have it in our library."
3,I was expecting maps I could read and use...they're not,"I was hoping and expecting to see some great maps I could use in my Civil War reading and study. They are not that. The maps are so small (can we say font size 2 or even less) for the most part, so faded, and so crowded with detail that I find them essentially unusable for what I wanted. I live in Yorktown, Virginia, for instance, and had a hard time trying to figure out what was what on that map when I know all the landmarks. The text is mostly about the history of map making during that era. Interesting enough but not a high priority on my reading list now. There are a number of nice period photographs which are fine. Still, with what I was needing and expecting, I am disappointed. I would not recommend the book unless you want to know about making maps during the Civil War rather than using Civil War era maps as maps.margaret1115"
2,Malfunctioned after 2 mos of light use,"For this price, I expected better product life span. My ears bother me often, and this product really works to relieve the itching and pulsing that I sometimes experience. However, I only used it for 2 months before it stopped working. I am returning mine for repair or replacement. If they honor their product warranty, I'll update this review.UPDATE: I downloaded the shipping label from their website, sent it back to them and received their replacement within days. Surprisingly fast! So far, it is working terrifically. I am changing my review from 2 stars to 4 stars. It shouldn't have failed in the first place, but it provides great relief when it is working. If it fails again, I'll update this review."
4,No more earaches,"Maybe just coincidence, but in the two months since we purchased and began using this device, my 6-y.o. daughter has not had an ear ache!Dinged a star because it could be more robust - the battery cover lost the first time she used it."
2,Unimpressed with product quality,"I received the ear dryer hoping that it would accompany me on many dive vacations in the future. At first glance it appeared bit less sturdy than I would have liked. Still, given the price I figured that maybe the light weight and feel were features. However, when I turned it on, the fan was not all that quiet. In fact, it rattled pretty good and was very annoying. So, when I combinbe the feel with the fact that it was noisy with the fact that it costs $100, I decided it wasn't worth it to exchange it for a new one that admittedly probably wouldn't rattle (I assume given the price that that is a true defect) and returned it for a refund. I give it the benefit of 2 stars because it probably would still do what it is advertised to do (dry your ears out). Oh, and I called the number in the documentation as directed: ""Please call us before returning it"" but was on hold long enough that I gave up. Looks like I'll be using my ear drops again this dive trip."
3,Good but Not worth the money.,I think the price is too high for such a thing. You can do the same thing by using a normal hair dryer on a low setting for 3-4 mins. Most doctors recommended that instead of this. I even thought of returning the product but decided against it since i wanted to keep a backup to my hair dryer and for travel. Also its cordless so that helps when travelling.Overall - Do not buy it. Better buy a battery operated hair-dryer with various levels of heat and small enough for travel and outdoor.
2,Not Quite What I Was Expecting...,"I would not recommend this book for a serious insight into coaching philosophies. There are much better and more comprehensive books than this on coaching. This book does do a fairly good job of documenting the coaching experiences of a few lesser known coaches that were very successful in their respective sports, but I wouldn't give it much more value than that."
5,Beautiful to look at and to hear,The Woodstock Windchime looks great from both inside and outside our home. We are anxious for warm weather so we can open our windows and enjoy the sound of the chimes even more
5,Best Chimes Ever,I love the low tone of these chimes and I am not a chime person. I purchased them for my daughter and she really is enjoying them. The kids then purchased a pair for us. They have held up well during very windy days. Too bad the price went up after the last purchase. I would have bought a set for our place in Arkansas.
5,Neptune Chimes take me away!,"Woodstock Chimes are clearly the best chimes I have heard, or seen. I stumbled on them a few years ago, when Amazon ran a Special Sale on TRCBRM Tudor Rose Princess Chimes, and was happily surprised. These Chimes of Neptune really take us away, and transform the whole feel of our backyard. It takes a bit of wind to start them ringing, but their deep sound is a perfect compliment to our Tudor Rose Princess chimes, which are still making beautiful music, seven (7) years later. We love Woodstock Neptunes!"
1,Horrible,"I'm sorry. I love gabber yet this is not gabber! This is some boring polka stuff. Just listen to the first track from Rob Gee""You want some X"". All the songs are lame except for Delta nine's ""No escape"" and it is an OK track. I'm sad to say that yes there is actually a slow boring gabber cd out there. This is a joke to me. I wish I can get my money back...and an apology."
2,replacement if you need one,The design is apparently deficient - won't stand up to the weather but I have two chimes installed in the house and need the button. I don't have a choice.
4,door bell button,Received in an appropriate time frame. Needs to be more information about the products for a decision to be made.
1,Mrs Markham should move right off the shelf,"This has to be the worst DVD I have ever wasted time and money on. Despite the ""English"" option it only has subtitles. It is poorly acted and DULL! I lasted 20 minutes before I turned it off. It was about as exciting as watching paint dry!"
2,Couldn't get past the first few chapters.......,"The author is certainly writing for a target audience.......as one other reviewer said, white, upper-middle-class, female would-be mystics. I found the stories of life on the commune mind-numbing (then again, I was born in Berkeley in 1970, so that hippie commune kumbayah stuff reminds me of eating carob when I was a kid) and the rest of what I did manage to read alienating.......zzzzzzzzzzzz.......I am not saying this is a bad book at all, just that it's focus was so narrow that it completely lost my interest. The language was so fuzzy and woo-woo that it just irritated my Gen X (for lack of a better word) postpunk sensibility. It's a shame, too, as I was really looking forward to this book and hoping it would assist me in reconciling my own struggle between feminism and spirituality. C'est la vie."
2,Interesting,"For the most part i did enjoy the book. The events and hardships that the charencters experienced were expressed nicely. It is very easy to read, yet there are glimpses of complex behaviors. You can read the whole text on one sitting, but i was a bit not happy. But what i did not enjoy is that the interpretation of events seem to be one-dimentional. It's the type of book that you read for fun, and almost forget that the book existed."
2,Could be better,"It is well written, the author includes components of life's struggles in a Hispanic ""hood"", however, it seems as if He is only writing to an audience that knows what it means to live in such ""hood"", I was able to picture the situations, but i felt no emotions. Only people with experience with gang warfare will be able to FULLY understand and relate to this book."
5,Rough Guide Outdoes Lonely Planet Again,"I was very happy to have Rough Guide Vietnam for my travels in northern Vietnam during December, 2000 - January, 2001. For one thing I felt like I wasn't getting channeled down the Lonely Planet path, as most independent travelers were carrying that book and using it like their Bible. Also, whenever anyone compared my Rough Guide to their Lonely Planet, they said they found RG to be better. Rough Guide goes into more depth than LP in describing the sights and history. LP's maps are a little more comprehensive, but RG's listings of hotels are more user-friendly than LP. I very much enjoyed the book."
4,not as good as lets go and lonely planet,"I would have checked 3.5 stars if possible, 4 is too high, 3 is too low. I didn't like the hotel section as much as other guide books. And I didn't like the price rating system, I prefer to have the prices in US$ or VD. Also the map in the front is not comprehensive enough."
2,The Lonely Planet was much better,I had the Lonely Planet and my friend had the Rough guide and the difference was quite great. The section on the Mekong Delta for example was vastly more in depth in the LP and I would have been totally lost if I had used the Rough Guide.
3,"Good player, OK MP3 playback","This player plays CDRs, DVD+R, & DVD-R (Ritek 8X only tested so far).Sound quality is good also, SACD is GREAT (with 5.1 out of course).My only compliant is that it won't random\shuffle MP3 CDs. I burned 100's of MP3s to a CD with a folder structure and it won't snuffle them. This VERY disappointing since I have an MP3 deck in my truck, MP3 boom box for camping, etc."
3,"Great DVD Player, but limited lifespan","I bought this DVD Player almost a year ago. I bought it to replace the Panasonic 5 Disc changer that I put in my basement. The Panasonic did not have the picture quality that I need given my 55"" high definition TV so I thought I'd try a Sony. It worked great for the entire year, but now it won't play any DVDs. About two weeks ago, I started having trouble playing a DVD in one or two of the five disc spots, but if I switched them around, I could get it to work. Now I can't play any DVDs on it. I was very happy with the player and I do use it several times a week, but it should last more than a year."
3,No digital SACD output.,Great DVD image quality and sound. Love the changer. I was replacing a 1999 Sony player that finally died.The exciting new feature for me was SACD 5.1 support. Unfortunately it did not work. SACD is not supported through the digital out of this player. Since my Bose Lifestyle supports 5.1 through digtal only I have to play SACD through my tv.I'm a little upset because I felt this issue was hidden deep in the manual and never would have expected such a limitation.
3,Chicago poems,The poems are great but the book itself was a sloppy copy of someone's used book. I think I should have been warned what this was. I gave it as a gift and was embarrased.
5,INEXPENSIVE AND ELEGANT,I COULDN'T BE MORE PLEASED. THESE RINGS ARE SIMPLE AND ELEGANT AND THE PRICE WAS TOO REASONABLE!
3,Paperback Cookbook,Decent little cookbook. I don't use it as much as I thought I would though. It just proves that not everyone has the same tastes.
2,Useless half the time,"This product rarely works at all. I've found that you have to press extremely hard on both sides of the device where the battery is in order for it to properly receive power. Even when it does work, the camera is rarely able to receive the signal for some odd reason, and I end up setting the timer instead."
5,Follow instructions,"Okay, So I bought this product knowing that it will be nifty to use. Considering I only have a Nikon D40, I figured it wouldn't hurt to get a remote for family pictures. At first I thought it would work right off the bat. Silly me, I should know better. So I looked at the small page of instructions that I found with the box. Granted the print was tiny, but, I found out I would have to set my camera to Quick remote. After that it went off perfectly. This remote is going to be a great asset for me in the future. Now only to get a taller Tripod."
5,Remote Control for D50 Nikon Camera,"This did not work with my D50 Nikon camera. After checking the remote control, it appears that it is sending out a signal to the camera so I think the problem is with my camera. So, purchase at your own risk."
5,First-rate first hand account,This book will fill some gaps in your understanding of the events surrounding the JFK assassination! The real perpetrators were never brought to justice!
5,I knew there had to be treatments available. Why don't...,"This book is the hope that so many of the afflicted need to see. Although the book wanders, the meat is there for the seeing -- with documented, impeccable evidence and wonderful, uplifting case testimonies. The book seems to have been written by an author, doctor, researcher who was putting his whole life into this one remarkable work. I hope this is not so! I have also concluded that the discoveries revealed within must have subjected Dr. Farber to some real danger. I don't think that Orthodoxy would want this exposure. One of my wife's employees was given 3 weeks to live on May 6, 1996 because of full-blown AIDS. On May 13th, treatment was begun using the Coll/AG 40 Mild Silver Protein. By Dec 1/96, treatment was completed. The subject was at that time, and has remained undetectable ever since. You should not miss out on this one!"
1,MARVIN PAUL FARBER COMMITTED SUICIDE AS PER THE HARRIS COUNY CORONER'S OFFICE IN HOUSTON TEXAS,"Mr. Farber left me several ink hand signed books of his all dedicated to ""his best friend"" and my name. I had known him from about age 9 until the day before he shot himself with a .38 caliber pistol in his small tiny little apartment in a hispanic neighborhood of southwest Houston on a Friday the 13th. He was atleast to me a kind, warm hearted and loving man and I shall always miss him. What is important is that his memory not be besmurched by the statement that he was murdered - he was NOT - but rather he killed himself because he was in severe pain suffering greatly since 1990 from advanced mutliple sclerosis and HE WANTED TO DIE. May his soul & his memory live in peace always. I do NOT claim to have been his blood brothers but he thought of me as his brother that much I know for a fact."
5,Results from marketing on the internet - Sales soar,"It has been my good fortune to read this book. This could free you as you leap into the world of real estate in cyberspace. As a provider of internet related services to realtors, I found this book to be practical and well written to focus on creation of your web site, getting found - which normally means it's easier to pay per click. Get started and sending effective emails. As a self promoted internet optimization junkie, it's easy to understand and explains how things work, really there is no mystery to search engines, keywords, and meta-tags. Even the sales-focused agent who leaves the details to his marketing people and technical assistants will want this book - to give to them to read."
5,Best Dusting Clothes,"We have temperamental furniture, which requires a lot of care. These clothes help from the dust scratching the surface of the furniture. They have some sort of oil to help with picking up the dust. It is good for about 2 washings and then I use the clothes for other purposes."
1,rusty bucket,we have the blomus dispenser and have been using it under normal residential conditions for the past month. rust spots have started to appear on the outer surface and a distinct ring of rust has formed around the inner seal.would not recommend this product - it blomus.
1,just sucks,horrible to get crickets into doesnt fit tight and its just not worth the time and money would not recommend
4,Cool ROCK man.,"This another great Exo-Terra product, very well made and functional. It's surprisingly heavy and thick and very durable. Safe for my chameleon or any reptile, perfect for supplement coating and feeding crickets."
2,"Bad Design, Optics","I've had this mouse for six months now and I'm not particuarly happy with it.It lacks an on/off switch and the slightest touch on the button turns it on for 5 minutes. This mouse has needed battery changes several times a week, mostly because it clicks on while in the bag.The optical mouse is relatively poor accuracy and is affected by textures on nearly every surface. I've compared this mouse to several different Microsoft Optical mice, and they've all worked much better than this BTMouse.The bluetooth works fine, it has a good range, and was fairly easy to set up."
2,"Great Mouse, But Flawed","I've been a fan of this mouse for years. Unfortunately, it is flawed by a bad clicker.This is the third mouse I've owned, and the second to have the clicker fail after about six months.Specifically, the most used left mouse button becomes flakey over time. For example, I'll click once on a window and it will minimize as if it were double clicked. Sometimes if I don't press hard enough it will click but not hold for a drag.Would be 4-5 stars if not for this problem. <frown>"
4,This isn't a mini it's a BTMOUSEJR !! Amazon wake up.,"I had issues with this sucking batteries dry, I figured out my Powerbook 12"" G4 1.5 was causing the problems. Had to load the latest bluetooth software and reset my PMU, it works fine now. I have really big hands with arthritis and had others that stressed out my fingers and wrists but this works for me. It's not perfect but I'm happy with it. Yea, I wish it had an on/off switch, you need to take out the batteries for transport. I'm not a gamer so it's quirks are barely noticeable. Batteries last a LONG time now! Once in a while the scroll goes nuts. I dropped it pretty hard one time and it didn't crack, scratch or quit!"
5,14 years and still loving it,"This is one of those albums that after 12 or 14 years, I still listen to. Many albums...after a month or so I hardly pull them out for listen. But this is one of about 3 or 4 that I never tire of. I originally was alerted to it by Electronic Musician magazine. But I have no regrets of owning this album. If you like good horn ensemble funk, then this is one to own."
5,Legends of Wimbledon,I look forward to seeing this DVD. I haven't had a chance to watch it yet though. Thanks again for the DVD.
5,The Best in Beauty,"If you like Italian art and beautiful women, then this is the book for you. Modigliani is without parallel. His art echoes the elegance of Trecento Sienese painting, elegantly garbed in the Paris of its heyday. Should your eye wonder more towards the purely formal in art, a delight in the abstract of form and colour, then Modigliani is also a master to enthral your eye and mind. Hope you enjoy the book as much as I do."
5,Brilliant!! Innovative!!,"This is not just a children's Passover book, it is a sensory experience. The bright beautiful illustrations are a visual feast, and are accompanied by a variety of hands-on activities to keep a child fully engaged while he or she learns about a traditional seder and the story of Passover. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a Passover experience."
2,Returning it,"It's one of those tactile touch, pull, open books for little kids, put in the context of passover. Those are nice books, and this one is as good as any, but somehow it falls flat. It's as if the Passover story was glued onto a generic kids book."
4,Great Passover book for small children!,"Enjoyed this book with our 2 and 4 year old grandchildren. We used it at the seder, and it was great that they were involved. Now next year, they will look forward to Passover with the idea of having fun and participating in the seder themselves."
4,"Good product, GREAT price","I bought one of these for my zune 8GB because all i needed was a way to charge in the car. After being used for 9 months, my wife accidentally pulled the cord out, without pressing the release clips and broke the wires. I re-soldered them easily and the charger is working again.Great product for the price!"
2,Meh...,"I bought this after my Dock/Charger broke, this product worked for several months and that's why it gets 2 stars, the fact that it worked for just that long is worth the price but the shipping is not worth the cons. You get static (though only when not playing music so don't listen to those reviewers saying you get it at all times) and the wires eventually broke because I had to have it stretched and like people said, it's a short cord."
2,Charges Zune but creates humming sound while playing,"The charger works and charges my Zune in my car. However, it creates a horrible humming sound through the speakers when I try to charge & play at the same time.This forces me to unplug it every time I want to play, which is a major inconvenience. It is definitely on the cheap side in terms of plastics and construction - then again it really IS cheap. :)"
1,Doesn't work,The red light on the charger goes on when it's plugged in but when I connect it to my Zune 8 nothing happens. From what I can tell the product is very cheaply made (made in China) and I would not be surprised at all if I had received a factory defect. Complete waste of money.
1,This Doesn't Even Charge My Zune 80!,"Looked like a good deal for the overall price, but when I plug it into my car and try to charge my new Zune 80 it doesn't charge! Had to use the cord that the Zune 80 came with and plug that into a D/C usb charger."
4,Works,"Used this product with zune 30, works fine. Charges zune properly. I gave it 4 stars because the cord itself could be a little longer. If you want to charge your zune 30 on a small budget order this charger."
1,worked for a week,It fell apart and stopped working after one week. Getting the item was super quick I have sent a email. No response yet but it was only a few dollars so not too mad about it
3,"Cheap, but works","First of all, don't misunderstand, this is a great buy. It is/was (at the time of purchase) practically free, and it serves its advertised purpose perfectly. That said, it *is* cheaply manufactured. It comes apart easily. If you aren't too rough with it, however, it should work just fine -- as it has for me."
5,great for the price,"For $.01 you cant really go wrong but this charger does the job well, its not the highest quality nor does it come in a package but it does the job well."
3,woked for a while,"This product worked as advertised. It only lasted 9 months for me, but at $3 a pop I can use it for 90 months for the same price as the official one. I think I'll buy a new mp3 player before 7.5 years go by...."
4,they're back,"Trans Am never fails to amaze me. They possess the ability to perform any style of music well. Here they shoot for an 80's new wave/synth pop sort of feel, almost reminicent of Philip Manley's side project, Knodel, but more dance oriented. Unlike the other Trans Am albums, however, nearly every song on TA has vocals (without vocoder, too). This is not a bad thing though. The vocals on this album are much stronger than those on Red Line.There are still a few songs that will please the purists, too. While the first half of the album sees them venturing into newer territory (for them, at least), the latter half echos the musical beauty of Surrender to the Night.All in all, TA posesses all the fury of old Trans Am while keeping the band pushing themselves in new directions."
2,Disappointing,"I've been a fan of Trans Am for years, and I have to say I got a little worried when I caught them on the Redline tour and they actually tried to sing quite a few songs. Well, this serious stab at a more commercial release speaks volumes, and for the diehard fan, it [stinks]. Trans Am leaves the indie-synth low-fi sound in favor of big drums & rehashed 80s production. TA isn't rockin' at all. While there are about 2 listenable tracks, the rest are long. Very long."
1,Does not even seal a bottle,"Looks great. Too bad it does not work properly, regardless of the depth at which I tried to install it. The o-ring seems to be positioned too deep in the bootle neck. The top does not turn any further at full depth and does not seal the bottle, while it seals but wiggles at a shallow installation. I am not sure whether it will hold the seal in a horizontal position, if left so for a day.You need to have a good grip to hold the stopper while turning the top part or it will never seal. Very sleek look and matte finish, which I really like, but not a good ergonomic design. I will probably return it.The Oneida stopper bought a year ago is not available anymore, but it works just fine (and it flips sealed with one hand), so it is not an unusual bottle. However, I bought two of Oneida stoppers and one of them already broke. We drink wine only occasionally (once a month), so I cannot endorse either."
3,Not What I needed it for,I was under the impression that this would work for Sparkling wine bottles but it doesn't. I work in a winery tasting room and have been looking for something that does not pop off or leak if on it's side. If I find this item I would also sell it at my winery. I'll keep looking.
3,Obvious stuff that you should already know,This book actually got my spouse and I into a fight over some of the items done or not done correctly. I mean after all it's not the Bible!!!
5,In Depth Book Into Mass Psychology of the Nuremberg Rallies,"I read this book in college and wrote a book review on the book. I wanted the book again because the first time I read it it was a library book so I could not highlight, scribble thoughts and notes in the margin, and keep the book as my own for my library. Well Mr. Burden does such a great job in statistical analysis of the Nazi Party Rallies, but he also does such a great job in portraying the mass psychology involved with any kind of political rally and how hundreds of thousands of people could be whipped into a frenzy over sick and sadistic ideals. I read this book and I could see so many relations to our current rallies involved with the Socialist leaning DNC and the Neo-Con Fascist RNC. I could also see so many correlations to the Nazi military propaganda and our own current propaganda with our own military to propagate wars for empire. This is a great book if you only just look for patterns because so much of history is patterned."
1,Horrible and misleading.,Is this for roll towels or toilet paper stacked? This things a joke. It's tiny and thebottom is a cheap plastic ugly looking base. Save your money. It will NOT fit a regular roll of paper towels. It's way to small. Maybe after the roll is half done. What a waste. A big 0.
5,Great purchase,"I really am pleased to have the speed bag and platform to incorporate into my workouts. The price through Amazon.com was fantastic, as far as my research had shown."
4,Smells like a baby!,"This pet grooming spray smells so good. I normally spray it on my hands, rub and aply it to my toy poodle's hair. The scent last long and your puppy smells like a baby because of the powder scent."
3,Does all it claims,"This wasn't quite what I was looking for, but it does accomplish what it claims. Nice fragrance; baby porder fresh."
2,Beware,"Everytime I buy a bath product for me or my dog now I check to see if it has propylene glycol. This does. It is a form of antifreeze so I try not to buy it but its very hard since it is in most conditioners, lotions and many soaps & deoderants, and I even saw it in Alcon's newest disinfectant solution for contacts."
5,Smells like a baby!,Now my 11 week old chihuahua can smell like the little baby she is. I spray this on her after a bath and she smells so good! Better price on amazon than at the pet store too!
4,Finally,"I expected Magog to be relesed as part of the Series 1 of Kingdom Come action figures. But I guess, it was worth the wait. This figure is represented just like its comic book counterpart, right down to the sneer. It has limited articulation, and is best for display purposes."
4,Hooray For Sugar,"This just flat out rocks. Then again, what else would you expect from this band!! All tracks on this are terrific. If you like sugar, get the EP."
5,Superbly written - the only disappointment is when it ends,"I've been reading books with a medieval theme for months trying to locate the perfect one to use in my 9th grade world history course. King's Shadow is by far the absolute best! From the very beginning the reader becomes emotionally tied to Evyn's character. This connection continues through the story with every fateful turn in Evyn's life. I found it most interesting to experience the Battle of Hastings from the viewpoint of the English and found myself sympathizing with them as they valiantly lost their beloved country. William the Conqueror is, of course, portrayed as the villian but rightfully so and I found myself hoping that this time the English would prevail. This story has all the adventure, emotion, and excitement needed to maintain the interest of readers young and old and will definitely become part of my thematic curriculum."
5,Not like anything that I have ever read!!,"It was an awesome book. It didn't take me long to finish, I couldn't put it down. I liked it because of how different it was and the way everything was decribed. The Battle of Hastings was described vividly, like you were there with Evyn and Harold. Definatly high on my book recommendation list!!"
2,Bedtime reading!,"Elizabeth Alder, an author that gives so much detail it could bore you out of your wits. Don't get us wrong... some of the population likes extremely long, drawn out books. However, in our opinion, this book doesn't seem to hold the attention of a young, but experienced reader. We have much better taste than this book. Alder is a great author.. but by no means, she is not the best we've seen. On some good notes, this author's vivid elaboration enhances the suspense of this book. Alder also uses a great deal of comparison. Elizabeth has a great sense of metaphors, similes and personification. Try this novel if you enjoy books for bedtime reading."
2,Great potential but falls short with audience,Just a piece of advice for new teachers: Don't use this book in your classroom unless you are 110% positive that you can engage students in the story. I would wait for a couple years of experience to see what grabs students attention before delving into this one.
2,"The book shot me with a tranqulizer, I slept well.","This book was, without question, super boring, except for the battles where people died. That was cool. The rest was just cowardly remarks about being not brave enough to do anything for his king. This book is a new different style of reading that was fun for two seconds but anything after that was like a sleeping pill, I can't believe I read the entire thing!"
4,"A great, enrapturing read","I was assigned to read this book in school, and was at first hesitant, but found it quite enjoyable. The story is an interesting one, and Ms. Alder does a good job of providing an enjoyable interface for the rich historical information. Disregard any bad reviews, it is a truly good book and deserves a read. You'll probably learn a lot on the way, and it is time well-spent. The only reason I did not give it 5, is that it sometimes drags on with some unimportant details, but it is still a great story with a solid plot, and is worth the longer read (all the more time to savor it!)."
4,____________________________________________________________,"This book was not one of my favorite books but it has practically all the requirements for a good book. Emotion, action ect. It got off to a slow start but picked up later on. Though action usually happens at certain times, it is well worth the wait. I do not want to give this book away by a summary of the whole story but I will say this; Evyn a voiceless squire, finally meets somebody who will respect him, and becomes that king's personal friend. I do not recommend this book to people with a short attention span. But I promise the ending is so unexpected, it is definetly well worth the wait."
4,The King's Shadow,"I would probably give this book a rather high rating, but since it was mostly focused on the wars , I was not particularly thrilled. Overall though, I think I was a good book worth the time reading."
5,Historical fiction with living characters,"Though I do not care for the portrayal of Duke William as an immature monster or for the fact that the story does not seem to be written from a Christian worldview, I have to say that The King's Shadow is one of my favorite books. Evyn is a compelling character, deeply passionate and easy to relate to, and the story as seen through his eyes carries the same traits. All of the historical characters seem like real people and I could sympathize with almost all of them. The morals are very good, and I especially appreciated how Evyn grows, losing his pride and hatred. The King's Shadow is an interesting and moving story that ends well, though sadly.For readers who would like a slightly different interpretation of the facts and more history, I recommendWulf the Saxon: A Story of the Norman Conquest."
4,:),"The service was great. Game case, booklet, and disk were all in great condition. It was delivered very quickly! The game itself is really cool. The story parts are kinda weird, because its just stills. No actual action or movements, but not bad. I bought this for my husband. He really enjoys it and from what I've seen, it looks like a lot of fun! Very satisfied! :)"
3,Worst and Best game ever!!!,"I thought that X-MEN THE OFFICIAL GAME was a very fun game. My son loves playing it. I asked him some questions about the game and these were his answers:1) Who was the best character?I think it would be Nightcrawler. I love that you can teleport as much as you want. In the beginning of the game when you are first him, after you beet the enemies, you can just tele port around the whole building! He even made his own story by doing that!2) Who was the worst character?WOLVERINE. His powers are stupid no matter what and this game brought out how stupid he is even more.3) Do you think that other people would like this game?Yes! Although you can only be 3 characters, it is fun. You will love Nightcrawler's levels the most!!!"
1,Not so Hot,"This game was very buggy, crashed a lot. they put out a patch for it but didn't help at all. if you read the forums on the game I'm not the only one complaining about this. I'm not very impressed with the game at all. I do not recommend the game to anyone."
1,NFS Carbon,"NFS Carbon is essentially a remake of Most Wanted and Underground 2 with some new cars and a new canyon duel mode. If you enjoyed those, then you'll love NFS Carbon. I, however, didn't. Electronic Arts should go back to the way NFS Hot Pursuit 2 was, with EXOTIC cars that you run from the cops and race to win cars and tracks.The only real thing I enjoyed on NFS Carbon and Most Wanted were the cop chases, with last FOREVER. Just as you think you've lost the cops, there they are again. I've had chases that have lasted 10-15 minutes alone!"
5,Awesome Game,Very challenging and has a free roam with fast cops. really fast cars and upgradable parts for all of your cars.
4,Not undergound,"Not as good as Underground or its squeal, or as good as most wanted, but it was alright.Liked the crew addition, and the canyon races."
1,No More games,"I never had a game before but likes to race IU expected this game to be good, I have never played it once because it does not play on my computer neither does it play on the console that I bought even after returning and requesting for a replacement"
3,No way an Audi R8 is faster than a Koenigsegg,"This game kept my attention, but that is about all I can say. The driving is quite unrealistic. The Audi R8 is faster than a Koenigsegg, and a dump truck has a quicker acceleration than a Porsche Carrera GT. The last boss race was so incredibly difficult that I had to play it on the highest resolution and best quality, slowing my laptop down so much that I could play the game frame by frame. If you are a NFS fan, then go ahead and get it, but I think I am a Test Drive Unlimited fan, and this did not satisfy my needs."
2,EA is full of it,"This game is ridiculous. My laptop exceeds all of the technical requirements, but when I installed the game, the first screen would come up and then the game would quit. A quick Google search shows that many others are experiencing similar problems. I downloaded the patch EA released to fix these problems, but it didn't so a single thing. I installed the game and patch on my desktop, which has almost identical specs as the laptop, and even though the it worked on the desktop, it repeatedly crashed, another problem that the patch should have fixed. What's worse? EA isn't doing anything about it. On their site, they admitted that these problems were due to their coding errors, but they haven't done anything to fix it, except to release a faulty patch. This game is not worth your money, and the actual game play is not difficult at all and can be beat in a few days. I'd say save your money, or get NFS Most Wanted, because Carbon is just ridiculous."
1,Need for Speed Carbon,"After loading this game, registering the product and attempting to start it up, I discovered that the game simply will not load. Once i clicked on the game to start up, it looks like it will load, however, once it loads, it freezes up. So I tried uninstalling and installing the game about seven times, rebooting, downloading the latest drivers for my computer. This is the second disc that i got and it still doesn't want to work correctly. I even tried installing into another computer and still had the same reaction as the first computer i used."
1,JUST LIKE MOST WANTED,"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS,I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED,ITS JUST MORE OF MOST WANTED.YOU CANT ADJUST YOUR STEERING WHEEL,GRAPHICS ARE POOR,SOUND IS POOR.SAVE YOUR CASH FOR A GOOD GAME."
2,Don't Buy This Game!,"I hate to say this, having been a big fan of all the previous NFS titles, especially Underground 2 and Most Wanted. But they really underdid it on this one. Aside from the ""team race"" aspect, there's nothing new and a whole lot missing. To begin with, it's just too easy. Gone are most of the great cop pursuits and bounty aspects, gone are the ability to set your own level of difficulty. Gameplay isn't really any different from any of the other titles in the series other than being...well...just too darned easy! I got to the end of the career mode feeling cheated, not having accomplished much. Still, the idea of ""team members"" is a good one, but I can't help wishing they'd have developed it more. In short, pass on this one unless you simply HAVE to know where the series is going. On second thought, let's hope the series won't continue in this direction; it's a dead end."
4,Carbon,"NFS Carbon is a neat addition to the series of racing games. The gameplay and graphics are above average and the story is narrated through slick live action cinematics. (Watch out for the lead heroine, she's hot!)All in all, a fun game to play."
2,All downhill since NFS:UG2,"I agree with the review ""The worst NFS game... 2.5 stars overall"" and if you own NFS:UG2, IMHO, you own the best there is in this series. Save your cash ... and if you don't own NFS:UG2 and since it's no longer sold in retail for the PC, check the z-shops for it used or new -- you'll save a lot plus get a really well designed / immersive game."
4,Nice mirror but high maintenance,"When I first saw this, I could have sworn it said 30X30. So I bought 2 for behind my couch. I was very disappointed when they arrived and they were only 21.5 inches. In retrospect, the 2 30x30 would have been too small. So... I ended up buying 6 and arranging them in 2 rows of 3. I must say, they look stunning. I love the chick, minimalist look and how it's opened up my living room to the views outside. I've now ordered two more for my bathroom. There goes my decorating budget!One word of warning, as others have mentioned, the finish is VERY hard to keep up. I've been polishing them for a couple of days with stainless steel products and I still see streaks. My other SS objects are not this difficult.I'll try to add a picture so you can see how they look in an array"
2,Not worth the price!,"I was happy with the rapid delivery, then again my boyfriend is a prime member. The mirror is very light as oppose to modern mirrors being heavy and thick. This piece is not worth the price asked for. The mirror was cheaply made, a square mirror glue to a metal boarder. From far I must say it looks elegant like on the picture. Feel ripped off but looks nice up on the wall, very modern."
3,Dissapointment,"Although I was happy with the speed of the shipment. This product doesn't look anything like it looks on the pictures. The reason why I'm giving this 3 stars its because it doesnt feel like its very solid. it feels cheaply made and i dont think this product is worth $75 bucks. If anything, this product should have been priced at around $40 bucks. I feel cheated. However, i must say that it looks beautiful on the wall, but once you feel it on your hand its feels cheap."
4,"Very good ""traditional"" performance of""Khovanshchina""","This is a very good performance of Mussorgsky's sprawling masterpiece, with excellent voices, old-fashioned staging,and gorgeous costuming.The ability of the performers to ""act"" is variable, but acceptable.English subtitles are automatic (and somewhat ""modern""). No other languages offered."
3,Poor Image Quality,"This is a wonderful opera! However, I needed to order it quickly, so I did not have time to compare the different versions available on DVD/VHS. I am especially interested in the final scene, when the Old Believers burn themselves up in their church rather than submit to Peter's men. I am rather disappointed, particularly because the image quality is poor, and the sound isn't great either. The scene that interests me is all right, but it is very short and not very dramatic. Maybe I should have gone with the Kirov: I own several opera DVDs and videos of their performances, and all of them are good. I just thought I should post this in case someone else is in the same position I was, and cannot tell from the comments and descriptions which version is best."
3,Wonderful performances but not easy to see or hear it,"I confess to a strange love for Mussorgsky's operas. This is one to cherish for its portrayal of turbulent historical times in Russia, wonderful music, amazing vocal performances and the staging. BUT-- it is a blurry video version on DVD and the sound quality at times diminishes the orchestral performance to a murky melange of instruments. On the bright side the powerful bass voices come through just fine. The acting is excellent. You may want to read the storyline a couple of times before watching (I had some difficulty following the plot lines)."
3,Kovanschina,"It is a seudo-historical opera with good voices, nice choruses and so-so sound and staging."
5,man on fire,"Man on fire is one of the best cds ive ever heard.The lyrics arefire and Chamillionaire wrecks some of your favorite beats.Thats not all Paul Wall and Mike Jones feel the wrath of the man on fire,im still waiting to here tippin down 2005 but im sure its good to."
5,Le Coq Sportif Escrime,Nice. Very nice. All of your friends will envy you for this unique and sleek design from the French design leader in sports shoes.
1,Too little,"I ordered this as my trash can for the bathroom, way too little, didn't realize how teeny-tiny this little trash can is, maybe for a child? Took the top off and am using it for body oils."
3,Time for Tea,"This is a nice CD to put on when you want to relax. It is by no means too mellow (no falling asleep to this one). The first 8 tracks are especially good, and the last 2 are mediocre. But overall, it is good, typical of Putumayo's collections of World Music.There really is not one unified style of all of these selections. There is something for everyone, from Turkey to China... My favorite was the Turkic verses of the soft and tinny sounding ""Saginou"" Zulya from Tartarstan. I really did not like the last two tracks. The music seemed too saccharin sweet, and way too repetitive."
1,Music from the tea lands,No he recibido el libro aún. Yo necesito una respuesta: el número de envío y la empresa de correo. Muchas gracias.
2,Ripping,The product came on time just fine but I've only used them 8 times and a seam is already ripping. These are pretty expensive and Triple 8 is supposed to be a good brand. Hopefully I'll be able to sew it up myself.
2,Poor Product,"I have had these less than 1 month, and the seams that hold the velco to the fabric are already tearing. I am not rough with my equipment, so needless to say, I will not buy this brand any more. I was not that happy with my knee pads, but have learned my lesson and will buy another brand in the future."
5,As promised,The wheel is a perfect replacement for our Atwood trailer tongue jack. It's now so easy to move the trailer around in the garage!! The product came on time and without any issues. Thank you!
1,"BEWARE! Not 2 wheels as pictured, Check measurements","Ordered these to fit grill legs. Two wheels pictured on web page - you only get one. Amazon's description is 1.75"" O.D., but O.D. is 2"". What they probably meant was 1.75 ID on this caster stem, fitting a 1.75 OD tube. Wheel I got had scraped up paint on it. Disapponted all around. Hoping Amazon can make this right.EDIT: Very easy return with Amazon, quick refund of payment and shipping costs. Amazon made it right by me. Thanks."
2,"Nice Looking, Low Quality","They look cool and are a fun design. However, the bonding on the back of one of them came off without much stress being put on it rendering it useless Even for $30, they seem like low quality. The site lists only a 90-day warranty against defects. If you are looking for some cufflinks you can wear more than say 5-10 times, I would look elsewhere. I think I only got about 5 days use out of them. Even at $30, that's $6 for each wear."
4,"Poor functionality as cricket jacuzzi, great feeding dish","My original intent was to use this as a cricket jacuzzi, however I had trouble maintaining the proper temperature and water circulation. In addition, my crickets would inevitably drown unless I offered them mini flotation devices.Since that plan failed, I used it as a feeding dish and it works pretty well. The rock appearance goes well with the rest of the ""Exo Terra"" products I got for a new desert terrarium. The reset button on the back could be a little easier to find, but at least it works."
2,A long wait in vain,"Having waited years since the release of the superb Don't Call Me Buckwheat and finally having to get the disk as a German import, this CD finds Garland meandering in territory that he's unsuited for. None of the biting edge of his better material is present; his street-wise vision of bleak urbanity lit by the promise of hope is completely absent. It's part pop, part 90s R&B -- all in all a disappointing outing from one of the overlooked talents of the 70s, 80s and 90s."
2,Big letdown,"I've got to echo the previous reviews. Very disappointing follow-up to the brilliant ""Buckwheat."" Garland has mined, very successfully, a narrow sliver of musical formats, but he's off on uncharted territories here, and it simply doesn't work for him. The album was out for quite a while in Europe, unavailable here during that time. That might have said something about what the label thought of its viability in Garland's native States. You can pass this one up, but none of the others, most notably ""Buckwheat"" and ""Ghost Writer."""
4,pretty darn good,"I'm surprised to see so many poor/negative reviews of this album. I think it's actually a very solid set of songs from Garland Jeffreys. Perhaps there are no out-and-out classics on here, but any fan of his past work should at least find a few songs to savor. And there are some very good tunes here. Give it another chance!"
1,Snore! Bore!! No More!!!,"Whatever you do, don't buy this album! It's bad...VERY bad! Usually I like to say why I do or don't like a CD (see my other reviews for proof!), but I'm not going to waste my time on ""Wildlife Dictionary"". Suffice it to say, this is awful, repetitive R&B/Disco/World Beat/Hip Hop, with only the slightly engaging ""Happiness"" showing any signs of originality and melody. Once again......this album is bad.....VERY bad! If you're looking to pick up a Garland Jeffreys CD, do yourself a favor....skip over this one and pick up the infinitely better ""Don't Call Me Buckwheat"" instead!"
4,feels cheap but works well,"It's your basic Chinese, thin-walled, functional steel pot. Think: one click above food-grade bimetal can, shaped exactly like the glass carafe you just broke. What did I expect? Well, the walls of the carafe could have been just a bit thicker. You can almost slice yourself on the top edge.And yet, we've used the darned thing every day for the past six months or so, and so far, its handle has held up well, staying attached to the body with no embrittlement or warping from heat. The lid attaches to the plastic handle in a not-too-balky way, so that you can remove it easily for washing. And it's never, ever going to shatter, not even when you fumble it one morning and drop it into the sink.Considering that it was probably made for a fraction of a dollar in some Chinese hell-hole, it is doubtless overpriced, but this was the best my search turned up short of buying a new coffee machine with a real double-walled carafe."
1,Don't buy these.................,"I am working on my old dodge '92 thought they needed shocks to smooth out the ride,bought these for the price.Opened the box and pushed on them I thought they were soft,put them on and I was right they are softer then the ones I took off that I am thinking are 19 years old.As for the ride no change,just alot of work for nothing,will be changing these out all 4 of them soon."
3,Good Component Cables,"Picture quality is great compared to standard A/V and Super video cables, but I had to upgrade to HDMI for superior quality picture."
1,ramzi,"its not working, bad product , it should be tested befor selling, i will not make a deal with this company anymore"
5,"A little hiccup, but satisifed","Although I was sent the wrong item at first, Amazon and the company the product was coming from quickly identified it and immediately shipped out the correct item, even before I had a chance to notify them of the mistake. The cable works well for it's intended purpose, connecting my upscaling dvd player to my epson projector and the image is clear without any visible interference. Satisfied with the product and the seller!"
2,not what I was looking for,"Based on the mixed reviews I thought I'd give it a shot. Plugged it into my laptop (didn't work) and my desktop (didn't work). It transmitted the video but if your computer doesn't output NTSC - don't waist your time with this. Good thing it was so cheap. The quality of the cable does seem pretty good so if you know your computer will definitely work with this, this is for you."
1,Not what it says,"This is an RGB to VGA cable. It does not have anything to do with component video, and will not work with component video connections."
1,It did not work,"I bought this cable to connect my laptop (The VGA end) to my TV (The RCA end) but it didn't work, I connected the VGA end to the laptop and the RCA to the TV in the component, and then I selected the component source in my TV and pressed Fn/F7 in my laptop but I got only some shadows in the TV, I'm positive that I had the correct plugging, but that was the outcome.The selling company has honest employees and they refunded my money at once."
3,Worked like a charm,Shipment is on time and just the way how it is described.Easy to connect my laptop to tv with this cable.
1,They don't work,They don't work. I just lost my money for nothing. so try not to buy it from online go buy it for the store
1,Poor quality video - did not meet my needs,"I tried to use this to connect a Panasonic DVD Player/Recorder/HD tuner, or an Apple TV to a BenQ projector that is capable of 720P. It produced a picture; but the quality was very low. Colors were almost completely washed out; and there was a pronounced green tint to the picture. If I understood more about analog video frequencies, I'd probably understand why there was no way this cable was going to work; but the low price made it seem like an acceptable gamble."
1,Crap,This is crap. it dosent work. i dont know how the hell to use it otherwise but it is not a vga to component cable
1,Not Functional,"vga will not convert to componet video. I tried to connect a computer to a tv using this cord. The cord would not work so I took it to Best Buy Geek Squad, they tried it on their equipment and it would not work either. They said it was unlikely this cord would be able to transfer a vga signal to a componet video input on a tv. I wasted my money on this."
2,Not as expected,"This is a VGA to RGB, the RCA component in it's listing is misleading. I thought it was a VGA to component video. It is not. I do not know if it works as VGA to RGB, I did not test it. It does not work as a cable to take VGA out of a computer to the component input of a television. I thought it would since the title has component in it. Again, I thought that was misleading. However, the price was great and the delivery was super fast."
4,"Product is nice, but requires High Def TV.",This product will not work on your tube television. The resolution just can't be handled (barring unless you have a high def tube television.) I made the mistake of not reading the reviews and now I have a useless cable. It's not a pricey mistake but a mistake none the less. Please make sure your tv can handle the output.
2,not working,"ok guys, i tried to connect it to t.v and laptop but its doesnt work, i wasted my money, i wish i would have gone to best buy or home depot to get this cable.... not a best buy for sure this one..."
1,Garbage,"This did not work from day 1. I thought it was just my laptop that couldn't display to my 32"" HDTV. But then I proceeded to try it on 3 other laptops with no luck. I should've returned it when I had the chance because I wound up throwing this cable away."
3,help,form what i am reading this item will not help me to connect my laptop to my color tv.does anyone know which cable i need ?i only have the vga output.no s-video or composite .thnx guys
5,"Didn't Need It, but I guess it works?","I can't complain about this product because I never used it, I wasn't sure what I needed to do what I wanted to do, but this wasn't it! So no complaints at all!"
1,Works Great,"I bought it to connect a DVD player to a BenQ video projector. Couldn't get it to work at first. After disconnecting and carefully reseating all plugs, it worked great!"
1,Doesn't work!!!,This didn't do what we wanted for it to do! It was supposed to hook up our computers to the TV but it didn't work at all! The screen kept flashing and losing it's picture. TOTAL waist of money.
4,Worked for Hauppauge PVR,"This cable worked to connect a computer monitor to a Hauppauge 1212 HD-PVR High Definition Personal Video Recorder (http://www.amazon.com/Hauppauge-1212-Definition-Personal-Recorder/dp/B0018LX0DY/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1355689472&sr=8-2&keywords=hauppauge+hd+pvr). Unlike the newer Hauppauge HD PVR 2, the Hauppauge 1212 HD-PVR does not have an HDMI connection. So if you want to hook it up to a computer monitor, you will either need an RCA-to-HDMI converter (which costs about $35), or if your monitor has a VGA connection, you can use this RCA-to-VGA cable (which costs about $5). However, be advised that this cable worked for the PVR, but it may not work for other applications (e.g. it may not work for a Wii or other RCA component video system)."
2,buyer be ware,"there are some things that should be noted on this product, first off it only works if the tv or whatever your hooking it up to uses just RGB, which most things dont! most tvs use Y pB pR which is different than RGB so beware"
2,Could be I got it backwards !,"I was going to use it to go from the component output on a DVD player to a flatscreen computer moniter.....""will not support this format"" came on screen...no go. Maybe it only goes from VGA output on comp to component input on a TV..?"
1,Not what I expected.,"This item only works on a tv that is set up to receive it's specific signal. The one's that accept this signal will have a vga port all ready installed. This cable is intended for a converter box that cost over $200.00 ""based on my research."" If you are trying to find a cheap way to get you vga signal to your tv as I was then this is NOT FOR YOU! Even if you do spend the money on the converter it still wont be the same signal as a tv with a vga port. Please don't waste your time with this."
1,Didn't work connecting my DVD player to VGA port on LCD TV,"Looking at the reviews, the scores are either 1 or 5, meaning that this solution seems to work for half the people who try it and not at all for the other half. Add my experience to the ""not work"" column.To clarify, as my heading says, I DID NOT TRY TO CONNECT A COMPUTER TO A TV OR PROJECTOR. I tried to connect a DVD player with component outputs to a television with VGA input. The result was that only the green signal made it to the TV; none of the other color signals were there (pulling the other plugs out didn't even have an effect). I checked the outputs with other equipment and all was fine. This cord was the only thing wrong.Some folks are posting that you need a special kind of component output for this to work. If so, the specs should specify. Perhaps this is an issue with standards across hardware, but the onus would should be on the seller to make it clear what the customer is purchasing and with what it will or will not work."
1,Not the cord in the picture,"In spite of the reviews, I purchased this cord based on the picture showing a 15 pin cable. What arrived was a 14 pin. Was told that the #9 pin wasn't necessary with newer computers and televisions, but since I have older items, it was necessary to have that pin. If you have older computer and television that you want to connect, this is NOT the cord for that purpose and won't work. Be sure to check with the seller before purchasing to make sure the cord matches the picture, if you dare..."
1,Misleading Name,"I do not want to sound like those who just scream how horrible a product is but this product is MISLABELED.By no means is this cable ""component"". After some extensive research I found this: [...] I found this helpful (in retrospect I should have done more but I thought I spent enough time looking up the answers)What this cable is is RGB - VGA cable. Component, which has the same looking connectors (Red, Green, Blue) is NOT THE SAME. I guess this would work if you are plugging it into 2 RGB - VGA units but I was not. I was using this to go from a Nintendo Wii component to a LCD Monitor (ASUS VH236H) VGA RGB input. Even though everything connects, I got no video. I tried this cable with 2 dvd component outputs to a RGB VGA input on a tv and got nothing. The dvd players and Wii work with the component input of that tv. To do what I was looking to do I would need a composite to VGA converter like the HD Box Pro.Be informed of what you are buying."
1,Dosent work,This item did not work when connected to my tv. The picture was scrambled. Glad I didn't waste a lot of money
1,Did not fulfill my needs,"Not sure what this is supposed to be used for, since it did not work for my intended purpose. I bought it to output the progressive output (RGB) from my DVD player to my video projector via VGA. the projector displayed; ""input not recognized"". Too bad, for I am left with the yellow composite video input."
3,Didn't Work,"I bought this cable to connect my PC to a TV with Color Stream (DVD) component input. It didn't work, but I don't know if it was the Color Stream input not matching up with the component output or if the cable didn't work."
2,Defective or Possibly Misused?,"I got this product expecting I could connect the VGA port of my laptop into the Composite in the back of my TV. The only effect it gave was a red fluttering screen on three different laptops and 3 different TVs, Whether or not it was the product being defective or me misusing it, I cannot say for sure. I do know an HDMI cable works for the same purpose, my interest in this was just to be able to project my screen on a nonHD TV"
3,Know the application before buying,"This cable probably functions properly with certain devices. Between my Mac Mini and my Mitsubishi Projection TV, it did not, best I can see is because there is a sync issue that one or the other do not support. The cable itself lacks shielding on the final component leads."
1,Not Sure What This Cable Is Actually For...,"I bought this expecting that it would connect the component out of my TV component video recorder to a monitor or projector, but it apparently does not work for that. The product description is rather vague so make sure you're actually buying this for what is is made for. The price is quite fair though. If it ends up not working, you only wasted a dollar plus shipping. The shipping took two weeks, to top it all off."
1,Piece of Garbage,"This was such a waste.It does not work, the replacement does not work, and the second replacement does not work. On MULTIPLE different setups.Do not waste your money."
1,Useless,"This does not work at all. Tested it both ways. Product designed to project a Component Source to a VGA Monitor. Monitor reads a signal, but no picture comes out. Tested it on Monitor and TV. This means while a signal is present, the cable does nothing to output video. Made me waste $$$ on collaborating products too (which all worked perfectly). AVOID/DO NOT BUY. not worth the postage for a return."
1,Didn't work for me,I tried to use with a macbook pro to a sony trinitron (kinda old). The video was all scrambled no matter what setting I put it on.
2,confused and sad!!!!,so i bought this with the expectation of hooking up my xbox to a vga screen. unfortunately it does none of the sort even though it claims to work both ways it doesnt and when i tried to connect my computer to a projector using it it failed as well. did absolutely nothing it claimed to. well now i have a $3 piece of chord to whip myself with...OUCH!!!
1,Junk,"Hooked this up to the component hookups on my tv. No picture at all. Laptop recognized the connection, but nothing. I thought maybe my TV was messed up. Double checked the connections. Everything was hooked up fine. Went and tried it on our HDTV. Nothing at first, but wait! A picture appears! Colors were off and the picture was scrambled. Went through the same troubleshooting. Nothing. Product is garbage. The price was the only good thing about this crap. Maybe I got a bad set. Who knows? I'm not wasting another chance on this again."
1,Not working,I bought the VGA to RCA component RGB cable but it does not work at all. Waste of money and efforts.VGA to RCA Component RGB Cable - 1.8M - M/M
1,Didn't work,"An attempt to connect a computer to a TV without a TV input. The cable never worked and is not in my ""Misc. Cables"" box."
2,Doesn't do what it looks like.,"This cable looks like it will convert VGA to component video, but it doesn't do it. I am not sure what the cable can do, but it is not made clear in the description. I am sure it has a purpose, but don't get it unless you are sure how to use it."
2,Decent cable... but..,"Decent quality cable but wouldn't work the way I hoped it would I a hoping to connect my laptop to my 40"" emerson hdtv and it wouldn't accept the output format."
2,DO NOT BUY TILL YOU READ USER REVIEWS!,"The item was $2; I had a gift card, I bought the dang cable before reading the reviews. My heart sank as I read review after negative review. It was unwise to purchase this cable; believing I could use it to connect my SDTV to my pc as a monitor. It did not serve this purpose; though through a little research after impulsively buying the decent quality cable, I have simply decided to invest in a decent modern HDTV.So I give it 2 stars, it serves no purpose; but it is of good quality and pushed me to buy a better tv."
1,Peice of S**T,"Does not work AT ALL!!! too bad I cant go lower than a one star, if I received this free i would still feel ripped off"
4,"Good Buy, Quick Delivery!! (READ THE DETAIL)","The cable works exactly as promised. That being said,many have and will buy this thinking it will convert the VGA signal to component, I WILL NOT. It does work well as described in the details of the product description."
1,lame,OK! looks nice cable looks fine but doesn't work????????? what's up with that man i mean i lost 4 bucks but still c'mon
1,did not work at all,"i dont know !! what went wrong...i tried to connect laptop to tv, pc to tv, pc to projector but none worked....!!!!!"
3,didn't work for what I wanted,"thought I could use this cable to connect my laptop to my projector (that has an RCA input) but I can't. To anyone wanting to do the same, you need the RCA with only audio video ends (not 3 ends like this cable). For this the easiest way is to get a converter box to plug into your pc so that you can connect your normal cables into that directly. Don't know about the quality of the cable I ordered, don't have anything to test it with. All I can say is that they delivered in a timely fashion."
5,Great book - wonderful gift for grandson who loves both sports...,Service was terrific and quite speedy since I only remembered the story a few days before my grandson's birthday. It came and he was so excited to see someone else loved two sports-baseball and basketball and succeeded at both! Very inspiring.
2,"OK, but there ARE better","Norris does a decent job of highlighting the development of the central doctrines of the Christian faith within the context of mission, but his framework is artificial at best. Robert Bruce Mullin has produced a MUCH BETTER volume entitled ""A Short World History of Christianity"" (Louisville: Westminister/John Knox, 2008)."
3,"Solid overview, but no citation whatsoever...","This is a very good overview of the history of Christianity. It is, however, COMPLETELY void of citation. No footnotes, endnotes, bibliography, etc. Though this obviously facilitates the reading, it leaves many claims ""unsupported"". I feel it is unsuited for academic work other than as a starting point for real research.Treatment of subject matter: 5 starsLack of citation: 1 star"
2,it was ok the first time around,"Let my girlfriend's 10 yr old girl listen to it. Sheenjoyed it. bouncing around the room like a jelly bean.but as an adult, i'm sure there are better qualityartists. Nice attempt, but to the mature ear, itcan only be tolerated so many listen-throughs.i give it a 4/10 rating. honestly"
4,Christian Mom likes Aurora for her Pre-Teens,"As a mom of 11 and 8 year old girls, I was thrilled to find another alternative to Brittney, Christina, etc. Aurora is filled with fast beat songs that kids can listen to over and over again. The best part of the repitition is that the message is suitable for Christian kids!!"
4,Yngwie Malmsteen has returned with a vengeance!,"Upon listening to this album, all I can think was ""hey this is just like Yngwie Malmsteen's 'Trilogy' but way better!"" To top it off, the songs are fully orchestrated, complete with harpsichords, violins, and recorders. The melodies are very upbeat and rather on the light side -- it's almost as if one can dance to the songs on this album.I highly recommend this album to Yngwie Malmsteen fans, and fans of classical-influenced metal in general."
3,"Decent, but the same old thing","Rhapsody is a decent band, but here you will find nothing above clichéd power metal with some strings in the background. Perhaps with their next release, Rhapsody might try to explore new ground."
4,Way Better Than You'd Expect....,...given the title which sounds straight out of Spinal Tap. Gluecifer sounds like the Stooges sometimes and early Cult a lot of times. Good by me!High energy hard rock n roll is hard to come by. So what if the lyrics are dicey - the vocalist sings them with conviction and who really cares about the lyrics in this genre anyway?Recommended.
1,Not for all Kenwoods,"Does not fit Kenwood Z919, really nothing else to say but it's making me continue to type to be able to submit my review."
3,Should have gotten LED,"I should have gotten the LED spot. This is ok for 80's nostalgia party. For a few extra $, you can get a more efficient spot in an LED spot."
2,Ok for the price - but barely so,"Good enough for a 'house party' as someone mentioned before me. In other words, it 'kinda' works but not really. The light beam isn't narrow/clean enough to do a good job on a mirror ball and the lamp mount is a bit on the flimsy side - it bends very easily. The lamp housing itself is solid though. Careful when taking off the mount as you're going to have a hard time getting the two wheel screws back into the housing.....! Would not buy again."
5,Definitely worth the money,This is actually a pretty heavy duty light. The large mounting bracket makes it very easy to mount on a wall or wherever with just a couple of screws.
4,Quick-paced murder mystery,"After Coffman (what kind of name is that for a detective, anyway) has been beaten, shot at, stuffed in a trunk, jilted, cat-scratched, nearly drowned, and he hasn't even been paid yet. People are dead, dying, and disappearing, but After keeps after the facts, inch by inch, even when he doesn't like where they lead. This is a page-turner, and author Vince Lutterbie's wacky imagination and oft-times humorous look at the darker side of small-town life kept me up late, reading just one more chapter. Definately get this one and hope for a sequel."
2,Not really good,At first the book is thrilling and funny. As you keep reading it becomes a little boring or maybe repeating. When you had read about 3/4 of the book you won't believe how many times the writer digress off the main story. The end is really disappointing. So as you keep reading the book will be more and more boring and you'll ask how a good beginning has such a bad end.
5,Great information in an easy to follow format,What a great book for those of us who are not mechanically inclined. It has tips and information on everything from purchasing a vehicle to how often to service the various components ~ from oil to tires to coolants. It also has great 'tech tips' on the various items and even gives basic estimates in the price guide portion of different items. A must for any new driver.
1,A misleading title!,"I feel bad giving a book a one star rating, but the title of this book is completely misleading. A vegetarian does not eat animals, and this includes fish, yet the cookbook has a whole section on fish. I did try a few of the non fish recipes, trying to give the book a chance, and they just didn't do anything for me. Fortunately, There are tons of excellent vegetarian cookbooks out there (sans fish!)"
4,Delicious Healthy Cooking,"While I can't argue that fish do not fit into most vegetarian's definition of vegetarianism, it is not uncommon for both health advocates and the general public to make this ""mistake."" The fact is that this book provides quick, easy, healthful, and incredibly delicious recipes. It is particularly suited to individuals or couples as it doesn't yield giant portions. I have found that every receipe I make from this book makes me look like a gourmet, while still helping me maintain a healthy eating lifestyle."
1,Since when did fish become a vegetable?,Beware fellow vegetarians. This cookbook contains a plethora of fishy recipies. To call this a vegetarian cook book is a lie.
4,Great Music!,"This CD replaces my original LP to save space in my collection. The sender packed the item well and sent it quickly. The songs are some of her best, and the quality of the recording is great!"
1,Did not meet expectations,"I tried this product because I loved the grapefruit body wash from bath and body works but they discontinued it. I thought this would have a nice grapefruit scent, but it just smells exactly like plain dove soap. I really don't see how they can claim it smells like grapefruit when it doesn't at all. I was really disappointed and I will not be buying this product again."
5,Great,"A must have for the true fan or a great starter to get someone in to REK. This cd is in my stack of regularly played albums, it never gets old."
2,A bit out there!,"Watched it for about 45 minutes then I could take it anymore. Could not relate to it, to far from reality."
5,Connie Francis will always be at the top of my list!,"How can anyone not admire this lady? Through thick and thin, she battled through and it shows in her performance, in her music, in her voice, in her stage presence. To Connie Francis: ""Hundreds of thousands of people love you (myself included) and wish they could see more of you""."
5,Essential Listening for fans of CAN,"In the likely absence of further new works by CAN collectively, we listen to their work as individuals. Irmin Schmidt has brilliantly realized an operatic vision of Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast. While showing the antecedents of Can and his studies with Stockhausen this, nevertheless, is a distinctive and breathtaking work that stands as a great triumph. The use of voice and the narrative structure of Opera lead to a greater unity and coherence of the work than in his improvisation based earlier work. The sweep of sounds that Schmidt elicits from the orchestra, instrumentalists and vocalists is stunning in its diversiy and consistency.I love it to death."
2,Kind of silly,"Personally, I don't like much opera that's sung in English, although I guess I don't care for opera that much either. Nor english opera with breakbeats and jungle beats. I was excited when I picked this CD up. A fantasy opera, based on Gormenghast, written by the guy from CAN? Sounded great, but fails in my opinion. It might have been fun to see it live, but listening is another thing. However, I let a couple of friends listen to it, and they loved it. So I guess you either love it or hate it."
3,Inexpensive should not mean cheap!!!,"...but in this case it does! Honestly, one of the straps behind the shield broke while I was slipping the arm through it and I just opened this not 5 minutes ago! Better have some crazy glue on hand when handling this product. And what's the deal with the different feet? I expected that both feet wouldn't fit on the base, but that is because the feet have different positioning and one leg seems shorter. Nice statue, but don't expect to get much play out of it."
1,Does not work as advertised,"Installed the extender as directed and tested it with Bell about 10' from transmitter - worked as expected.However, when I moved the Bell to the basement (which is about 25' and down one floor from the transmitter), unit did not work UNLESS the door bell button was held down for about 3 seconds. Unfortunately, most visitors do not hold down the door bell button long enough. I suppose I could put a small sign over our door bell stating 'please hold down button for 3 seconds' but my wife is not going to approve.The problem is the transmitter does not power up until the door bell button is pressed and then only transmits while the button is depressed. If the Bell is close and picks up the signal, it works but for long range applications, the transmit time is too short. Guess I'm going to be snaking wires in the wall."
5,Works as advertised. Easy to install. Couldn't be simpler.,Works as advertised. Easy to install. Couldn't be simpler. We have the bell receiver located in an addition about 50 feet from the transmitter. The signal has to go through two outside walls covered with aluminum siding (or it's bouncing through the house?). Works fine and solve our problem of not hearing the doorbell when working in that part of the house.Later: It's now been installed more than 3 years. Still works fine.
2,"Got a defective unit, but return was handled great","After setting it up, it worked except that the volume on the recevier, even when set to high, could barely be heard. Worked through Lamson Tech Support and they determined it was defective and that I should return to where I bought it. When I contacted DS Home Solutions, they handled the return quick and easy.If I had received a working unit, it would have been a great solution for us."
1,Did not work,Bought from ANTonline. product arrived defective & they did not want to pay for return shipping.
2,Lamson RC3 Extend A bell,"when I received this plug In extend A bell item, I was kind of expectinga system that required no wiring at all, something similiar to what Ihad about five years ago that performed well but wore out.I returned this item to the seller unopened, so I can't rate it fairly,but I had to for this review, it just wasn't what I was looking for.The seller CrazyDavesToolShed very promptly refunded my money.In the meantime, I will continue to search for an extend A bell,that you just plug in only that has no additional attachments."
5,Great,"Simple to install, worked right off the bat. I was worried that my doorbell would be incompatible in some way, but everything was as expected. Now I can hear my doorbell upstairs!"
2,Not loud,"Not loud enough others chime extenders I have punched for customers work fine the volume control switch low, medium, and high did work. But not this one even know the customer was okay with it high was not high there was just one setting low the switch could be any position and low was the only thing you got."
4,Extend-a-Chime,"The extend-a-chime I ordered came exactly as promised. It installs and works just as I'd hoped, although it could be a bit louder than it is. The transaction went off without a hitch. Thanks for the great service!"
1,Bad Luck,The device didn't work. I think it is defective. I have seen others that worked fine. It will be easiser and cheeper to buy another. I don't know how to send it back. Bad luck.
4,we have several T&B receivers around the house. Now we can hear the bell,Would get five stars except the little jumpers to select the chime are hard to move without taking the cover off. Very easy to connect. Wires are labeled. I just let sender hang from wires.Plug-In Extend-A-Chime - RC3200 [Electronics] [Electronics] [Electronics]
1,Did not work for me either,My old battery operated extend a chime finally died after 5 years...saw the great reviews on this one and just installed it...Well it doesn't travel far enough like the old one did. And it appears you have to hold the door bell button in for a half second longer to work at short range. What's funny is my old extend a chime has horrible ratings on Amazon. Shoot looks like the seller is not Amazon. Hope I can get my money back.
5,Bakin without eggs,My mom in law came across this cook book during the holiday season. I was very surprised how delicious the recipes are! I feel so relieved to be able to make normal everyday recipes that my 2 year old can enjoy. I dont even make regular recipes anymore. I always reach for my bakin without eggs 1st without even a second thought!
2,Overall good but be cautious!,"The book is overall good. The recipes for standard treats like 'chocolate chip cookies', 'butter and pound cakes', banana bread etc. turns out to be great but most other cakes/breads have a bitter after taste ( may be due to the excessive use of baking soda and baking powder).One recipe for a 2-cup flour banana cake asked for 2 teaspoon baking soda and 2 ""Tablespoon"" of baking powder!!!!!(may be a printing mistake).I used 2 teaspoon baking soda + 2 teaspoon baking powder .. and the cake was good.So apply your skills too instead of blindly following the recipe!!"
3,Store-bought cake mix? Why would I need a cookbook for that?,"Anyone worth it's baker's beans will be offended by the cookbook advocating the use of store-bought ""yellow cake"" to bake the items listed. If I wanted to buy a cake mix to bake my cake, I would not need the cookbook in the first place.Additionally, if you cook for an allergic child, then the last thing that you want to do is to subject your child to boxed mix packed by who-knows-how in some faraway lands.That said, for a new baker this may prove a priceless treasure trove, but for those of us with a bit of flour behind our ears, this cookbook is a bit too basic and unnecessary."
2,Omitting eggs is not enough,"Nothing I've made from this book has been terrible, but nothing was all that great either. There is too much baking powder and/or baking soda in a lot of the recipes to compensate for the lack of eggs- it creates a bitter taste. A lot of the recipes seem like very standard recipes- just without eggs. My most successful egg-free baking has usually involved the use of buttermilk or soy milk with vinegar, a technique not utilized extensively in this book. I like Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World and Vegan With a Vengeance better."
3,a mixed bag,"I am a lifelong baker with two egg-allergic children, so I decided to invest in this book about a year ago. Some of the recipes are fantastic (cheesecake, chocolate mocha cake, pancakes, pumpkin pie). But some others have been the most spectacular failures I've ever seen- things with no flavor and terrible, terrible consistency. The vanilla cupcakes I made from this book were inedible. And I recently tried her pound cake, which collapsed when I took it out of the oven (20 minutes longer than the prescribed baking time) and then fell apart into crumbs when I removed it from the pan.Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of choice available to those who want eggless baking recipes. I wish there were better books out there, since I've had so many failures from this one.In general, plan to bake things *A LOT* longer than called for in the recipes. I have had to bake things as much as 30 minutes longer to get them to cook all the way (and, no, it isn't my oven!)."
1,opaque jargon on parade,Don't bother. These papers are filled with the kind of academic pretense that makes one question the whole enterprise. Pass it up in favor of theory for dummies ...
3,Informative but indulgent,"I found this book good in a factual sense, but poorly written. It seems that the author is trying to be poetic in every sentence. It seems that some of the stories offered are also irrelevant, or at least he doesn't explain the relevancy. I would have much rather preferred that he simply tell the story of a great man, rather than trying to tell a great story."
2,No many secrets to be shared....,"The author seams try to hide the little information he was able to gather from outside the Soros's circle with a poetic writing about his rise to be a ""Master of the Universe"". But the fact remain that the book give only a very superficial idea about Soros and for sure do not address the big question about him: ""Devil's Master of Globalization or Saint of a New Economy?"""
2,Wasted time...,"I don't like guys like Soros. For me,they're not more than a bunch of heartless son of a bi..es , even making more money than I'll make in a thousand lives! THe book is weak, because Soros' people were forbidden to talk to the author. But is clear that Soros pilantrophic intentions are a cruel fake, destined only to create more money at the expenses of the Eastern European people."
4,we are good friends,"I just finally used the sand wedge this past weekend, left bunker, hole 6. It got me out of a tight situation, a tad bit over the green and I won't blame the sand wedge for that. saving for par made us instantly good friends. I don't plan to be best friends with this one since it'll mean I've been visiting bunkers far too much ! a good buy and I'm happy."
4,About a Boy (Widescreen Edition),"I liked this dvd because of the actors portraying various parts, especially Hugh Grant and Toni Collette. Although the boy was seeking a father in the boyfriends that his mother dated, he was disappointed many times, until the Hugh Grant character appeared on the scene. Even though the Grant character enjoyed the boy and spent time with him, he wasn't very fond of the boy's mother played by Toni Collette. How this all evolved is the core of the story, so I won't say more about it. It's a situation too many children experience without a perfect solution. A.M. Seidler"
1,A stapler that can't drive a staple,"This staple could'nt even drive 5/16"" staples into soft pine. The staples would usually bend over after going half way into the wood. Its built really nice, feels great, has a nice weight to it, but is unable to staple. I must have tried at least three dozen staples. Maybe there was something wrong with the one I had, you might get one that works. If you can find one that works, i would like to know; I'd probably buy another since I returned the one I'm talking about for a refund."
2,Pitiful Attempt,"I really enjoyed the last few X-men games and was highly anticipating finally being able to play one on the 360. What a waste of money. While game play graphics are passable, transition, intro and cut scenes are terrible. Heck they aren't even animated. In fact the cut scenes look like they were developed with Flash and their quality is surpassed by South Park.In terms of game play, you are restricted to three playable characters and mission based scenarios. Wolverine is straight button mashing hack and slash, Iceman is basic aerial navigation and shot lineup and Nightcrawler plays like the Prince of Persia's retarded cousin.Save your money and if you really feel the need to spend some time with an awful video game, go dig up a copy of ET from the Atari 2800 land fill."
3,An ok video game,"I havent played this game alot, just for a hrs. This game is nothing like the X-Men Movie's. The game can get boring while playing for the 1st few minutes. I purchase this game thinking it would be like one of the X-Men movies as it was described. I wish They could've off been more characters, especially females like storm. I did enjoy playing Iceman. Graphics were ok, it does not give justice to the xbox system// Then again, video game was release about 5 yrs ago.."
1,heads up,I bought this game by accident but I tried any way. I didn't like it and the creaters did a bad job making it.
4,cool.....,great for mind trips.....a dancing inner self...with funkylistic beats....it's really is different...unique...
3,Not what I expected,"This would be a good book for someone looking to restore furniture.Not enough new, practical information for me. Iknew most of the info already,and while I like to look at before and after photos, there weren't that many in this book.Oh well, win some,lose some!"
1,Another poor use of the Look Inside feature!,"When I use the Look Inside feature, I don't mean to steal information, or read the book. With a craft book, I want to see what sort of results this author gets. For some reason, and it really puzzles me, some of these books will actually let you see all the techniques in detail, but none of the 'looks' produced!Hint: this is a craft book. It should appeal to artists. Eye candy is what you should show. Showing HOW the work is done is the no-no."
1,SEARCH INSIDE... WHAT?,"I usually only bother with books that offer ""search inside"". Though this one does offer that feature, what a joke. Trust me, when I am interested in a book, I look through the whole thing first. The more I see, that I like, the greater the chance I buy it. Is the author afraid of us stealing ideas, or is she afraid that when we see the illustrations, we won't want to purchase the book? I won't be buying this book."
1,<sigh>,I have not received this book yet. How am I supposed to rate something I have not received nor read?
3,What the hell? The first formula is wrong!,"This is the first formula in the book (page 2) for skin depth area calculation of a conductor: A1=pi*r1*r1, A2=pi*r2*r2, Skin Depth Area=A2-A1=pi*(r2-r1)*(r2-r1).What the hell, did you go to high-school, Mr Bowick?The book is printed nicely with good looking charts though."
1,I'd be better without it.,"I have both the fast and slow rhythm.I love the fast,but don't really care for the slow.More than half of these songs have the same exact beats.It sounds like the same song over and over again.There is a slight variation to the songs,but not enough to make it not so annoying.I wish I didn't buy it.If you interested in either the fast or slow,I'd get the fast one.That made me want to get up and start shaking.Hope this helps."
5,Great for relaxation,This CD is a very peaceful and relaxing. I have very stressful job and this music helps me to relax while I am driving home. I recommend it to everyone!
4,Good freestyle!,You hear right away this is the voice of the Cover Girls and it's always good to recognize a voice straight away. A big plus for Angel. Angel gives us a steady freestyle album that'll make any freestyle fan happy. Nowadays she sings with SAL (Lil Suzy and Lisette Melendez) and is touring. Check her out :)
1,What??????,"What happend??? These guys got on the wrong bus, train... what ever. The music turned a corner and they got the crap kicked out of them. This album stinks."
2,wrong direction,"I was really excited about this new PE cd when it first came out. I bought it, took it home, and was immediately struck dumb at what I was hearing. The music is nothing like the PE I knew. Seemed they where trying to become a poor man's version of Van Halen with the lame electric guitar solos. blech!! The next day I sold the cd back to the music store. Years later I bought the Best Adventures cd. It has 3 tracks from Race. I listended to those songs and once again was horrified at the hard rocking turn PE had taken. This time around though I could hear the Brian Canham melody that are in PE's better efforts. So I was able to appreciate the songs from Race a little more. Not much though."
2,Why Does Everybody Like This Episode?,"I am so surprised that everyone likes this episode. The acting is Monday morning awful. It seems like the cast needed to take a ""shore leave"" or something because you could tell that they just weren't in to doing this episode. After Obsession, Star Trek didn't need another ""We have to destroy this thing before it multiplies"" episode. I don't know how to put it into words but this episode had such a horrible atmosphere. As Scotty said, ""It doesn't feel right""."
3,This episode gets a C+ grade and is ranked 50th out of 80,"First the Gamma 7A system disappears without a trace...and then Spock receives a mental shock from the loss of the all-Vulcan U.S.S. Intrepid. When the source of the destruction turns out to be an enormous, non-sentient space-going amoeba, Spock nudges out McCoy for the shuttlecraft mission to plant explosives to blow the thing apart. The decision rests heavily on both McCoy and Kirk, who makes the choice knowing full well that he will likely not see his first officer again."
4,tooth tunes,I bought this for my granddaughter...she uses it often and will brush until the music stops..which has her brushing for longer times. I think she really likes it.
1,Worthless,"The toothbrush is not an electric toothbrush. Instead, it is a manual toothbrush that encourages hard brushing. The harder you press on the brush head, the louder the music plays for your children. Granted, my kids were excited to brush their teeth, but you might as well play music for two minutes and let them brush with an electric brush. Don't waste your money."
3,Not all that,"I bought a quart ($50 + shipping) direct from the vendor, expecting to be amazed based on AMZN reviews and reviews on the vendor's site. I wasn't amazed. Yes, it is delicious, something like a lobster bisque with a few chunks of claw meat added. Very rich and flavorful, but not noticeably better than any premium lobster bisque in your grocery. Did I enjoy it? Absolutely! Would I buy it again? At $50 a quart plus shipping, no way. A can of good quality lobster bisque plus a few big shrimp will satisfy your craving for the flavor and leave a lot more money in your pocket."
1,"Thin, Watery, and Lacking in Flavor. Unimpressed.","I purchased this with the expectation that, like most lobster bisques I've had at high-end restaurants, it would be creamy, thick, and filling. Instead, it was watery, thin, bland, and not at all worth the price I paid. Yes, there is a decent amount of lobster meat included in each serving, but it does not compensate for the lack of flavor and texture in the soup. I would strongly advise against spending your money on this.That being said, Hancock's lobster mac and cheese is fantastic and worth every penny."
1,Dissatisfied,I ordered the Blomus Stainless-Steel Flask. Amazon states in the product details that this flask is Made in Germany. This is a lie! The flask arrived today and it is made in China. I am returning it. Amazon should get its facts straight. I will be ordering less from Amazon in the future!Dissatisfied customer!Albert Brock
2,Made in China,"Seems to be hit or miss based on the reviews, but I have one of the flasks that was made in China, not Germany (see my posted image). If this is not important to you, then no big deal - initial flask quality appears to be ok and no leak - or lead poisoning - so far. Yes, I certainly understand practically everything is made in China these days, but my rating also reflects my disappointment that the value - and for me safety - of this product is not represented accurately based on the description. If you are ok with a Chinese made flask, there are plenty of cheaper choices. So if false advertising for a premium price doesn't matter - or you want to roll the dice you get the supposed German made product, then best of luck! Otherwise look elsewhere. BTW, if it helps and makes a difference on where the German vs Chinese made products are coming from, the merchant that shipped mine was ""Bambeco."""
5,Love It!,"Love this flask! Very high quality, and doesn't get stained and crappy looking like some other ""stainless-steel"" flasks I've seen in the past. If you're in the market for a sleek, high-quality flask, this is probably the one you want."
1,It LEAKS (Otherwise it's a great flask),"I bought my first flask and had it about a year. Then it started leaking where it is seamed togeather. I thought it was a fluke, so I simply replaced it with the same flask. After mild use, same exact problem in the same exact place, right at the bottom where the seam is welded. This saddens me. I love the flask, design, size, everything, except it's useless when it fails and leaks."
4,Flask looks Good,"Flask looks good, nice quality. DO NOT BUY THE 3 PIECE FUNNEL, IT IS WAY TOO BIG! I had to return the funnel and buy the stainless flask funnel. This flask is only 6 oz. Kind of small a 12 oz would have been nice. You are not going to feel 6 oz of liquor."
4,Good first album!,"I bought this after seeing the band live, and while it is a good recording I have to admit that it does not adequately document their abilities. This is their debut CD, and being a few years old it sounds a little dated. Still, it serves as a nice introduction to their sound. The sax player who plays on this album no longer plays with them, and with a keyboardist in his place I think they have really found their sound. The tracks on ""Time Stops"" are mostly instrumental, whereas they play more vocal tunes now. Still, even though this debut CD is not perfect, it has really grown on me and I enjoy listening to it during my mellower moods. It suggests great things to come and is certainly worth good listen."
1,Save your money,This is made of very thin metal. It does not keep the coffee hot and does not fit a standard Mr. Coffee coffee maker. It might make a good planter....
4,Old school is back...,"The new solo CD from former Twisted Sister frontman is a true throwback to the old school. In this age with all the rap-metal, punk-pop, and industrial metal sounds out there, its downright refreshing to hear an artist staying true to his sound. This album reminds me of Twisted's Stay Hungry album, but a bit heavier in places. The opening track ""Hardcore"" is a scorching tribute to Lemmy from Motorhead, one of the best tracks on the album. I would have preferred another original track as opposed to Dee's cover of the ""Wanderer"", but he actually pulls it off. The hooks and riffs are memorable, and transport you back to a simpler time when metal was metal,and not diluted like it is today. I would have preferred a couple more fast songs however, as most of the album is mid-tempo. Still, for fans of Dee and Twisted Sister, this is recommended."
4,Odds & Glam Gods,"Great little rock album from Master Snider, a good mix of hard rock, rock n' roll & a couple of power ballads (well it was the 1980s!).I think it works better than the ""Desperado"" project; the Anglo-American mix never really jelled.Admittedly it's no ""Dark Side of the Moon"", but it hits the spot just right.Reading the liner notes, it is interesting that Snider writes so many songs, then votes for the best. You think if he wrote less & spent more time on the tracks, the quality of songwriting may improve, just a thought."
5,SciFi Geek,"I can't believe I actually spent as much as I did for this, but as a recovering SciFi collector, I sometimes got to have something. To this end, it was totally worth it. The toy store back East that had this shipped it timely and chose USPS, who surprisingly provided tracking and delivered at the earliest time they'd estimated. So, when you need to get your hands on a Mercury Class Heavy Destroyer, then Amazon may have just what you need :)"
5,I love it,B B King shines in this CD he is a master of blues on guitar. If your looking for blues this it.
4,A good buy!,I ordered two of the adaptor cords and was pleasantly surprised to find they also included a RCA to Mini-plug adaptor. They work fine and quality is good. I'm glad I found these after seeing others for twice the price.
