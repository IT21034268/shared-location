1,Metallica the complete story,This is a terrible depiction of the band. They have no affiliation with the group involved and is very amateur. Don't waste your money!
4,"Good book, not sturdy","The potty in this book looks just like my daughter's little red bjorn. The book is not pushy, it has bright colors and the lift the flap format is great to occupy my daughter during potty time. BUT the flaps are very hard to lift, I had to bend them all so she could get them up. And they are easily torn. We have had this book for 3 months and it already looks ""well-loved"". She still loves it and I will patch it up and buy a new one eventually if I have to."
5,real fireplace,I use this when I want a warm atsmophere in the room. I love the sound and the fact you can chose the music you want. My favorite is at Christmas time. It is very realistic. You can feel the heat. You also can let it burn with no sound but natural crackles.
3,dvd is ok,"The DVD is ok, I was somewhat disappointed that it did not cover the entire tv screen as I have A 42"" tv. The sound and picture are ok."
3,Not meant for infants...great for 12+mos,"This book is NOT meant for infants...it's for older babies/toddlers who can ""grasp"" the differences in touch. I bought it when my son was about 8 mos, and he didn't like it at all. BUT...once he could start to understand textures, he really liked it."
1,What a letdown!,"My son loves Bear. However, this book was so lame, I mean, really the touchy feely parts were outside lining the book, and a real bore, even for my infant. He was amused for half-a-second, and then threw it down. After a few more attempts to interest him, I realized only an amoeba could appreciate this. Don't waste your money$!"
5,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly","The author takes 12 men in the Bible - 6 from the Old Testament and 6 from the New Testament - and goes into great depth about their character and their relationship to God and Jesus. As the title suggests, some are good, some bad, and some ugly in spirit. It gave me a new perspective on the lives and times of these people. It was very informative and had some humor in it also."
5,"Great study guide, not for the new-to-networking","If you are already a ""networking geek"" the CNE short course is an excellent study tool for the Novell tests. It is concise and doesn't flood you with much information that is not covered on the tests. However, if you are new to networking or to NetWare products ... I would steer away from this book. The author covers most topics at a fast pace and will blow the novice away"
4,Screen Shots are great for explaining Access Features,"WOrking with MS Products has a strong visual component. I liked this book because the pictures and explanations are very clear. This allows one to pick up a procedure or skill very quickly. A very good book for beginners to intermediates. So so for advanced, although the coverage of Pivot tables is pretty good"
3,"Half-Way Decent as a Reference, Not Much More","This particular book shows some promise w/ all the illustrations, but really falls short of my expectations. The descriptions of what's going on in each step are REALLY vague, and tend to be more confusing than helpful.I've got quite a bit of experience over the years w/ Access, but just wanted some sort of refresher. This book MIGHT be ok if you only wanted a really basic reference of some sort, but I'm sure that better ones are out there anyways.For someone looking for a beginner's book of some sort, stick w/ the Dummies' series, or the 24-hour books."
4,More Fox Funnies,"The Fox family are back in their latest compilation of daily strips. Jason, Paige, Peter and their parents are up to their usual tricks. This collection contains such story arcs as:Jason creates his own video gameRoger checks out the HumblerJason creates Christmas cardsRoger rides the Polar ExpressThe Foxes get MomvoPeter and the pink sweatshirtThese and more make up another fine collection. Fox Trot fans will not be disappointed by their antics in this one."
1,The worst thing I ever bought,Watching this is similar to reading an elementary math book after passing a calculus class. There is nothing you couldn't figure out on your own just by typing a couple of words in google.
5,An amazing read - this book shows God's love and grace,"""The Letters"" is a must read. It is incredible, inspiring and so true to life. I didn't want the book to end! I can not wait until his next book! God bless you."
4,I couldn't put it down!,I loved this book and the idea that we could receive personal letters from God. I liked all the characters and the way the author flipped from one to the next. It kept you interested and wanting to know what happens next! I can't wait until the next book!
5,We like this tea.,"We like Lipton Tea (Lipton 100% Natural Tea, Tea Bags, 48-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)). We drink it iced or hot. Sometimes we put it in a big jar filled with water and set it outside in the sun all day to make sun tea."
2,Substandard quality tea,"The bitterness in this tea is way too strong, and the flavor weak. It leaves a strange, bad taste on the sides on my mouth when I drink it plain. It's only really drinkable with milk and sugar, or iced with sugar.Instead, I'd recommend trying a nice looseleaf black tea. Failing that, try Lipton's Black Pearl if you want a decent bagged tea that is easy to find. Twinings ""Prince of Wales"" is another good bagged tea.BTW, ""Orange Pekoe"" does not refer to the flavor of the tea. It refers to the size of the tea leaf pieces. Strangely, Orange Pekoe is used for large pieces, whereas this tea contains smaller pieces - yielding more bitterness. I'm not sure why they use this term."
3,Good buy,"These are standard Lipton tea bags, like at the super market but at considerably less money."
5,Lipton tea,"I love Lipton Tea, It's the best. I decided to stock up and it paid off, the price was right at the time of purchase and will purchase more by the case. If you love Lipton, get it here by the case. Take that Lipton Plunge."
3,Run Of The Mill Bio,"Bite Me! is a fairly average bio on Buffy The Vampire Slayer star Sarah Michelle Gellar. You get the background information on her career leading up to Buffy, but nothing revealing and it has appeared in countless other bios and is written in the dumbed down fanzine style. You also get episode reviews of the first couple of seasons but they are not enlightening. What saves this book is the info on the web sites, clubs and other stuff for fans to get involved. Also, there is a quiz and alot of color photos. If you like Sarah Michelle Gellar and Buffy and you don't own other bios on her, this book is as serviceable as any of the other bios out there. If you are really interested in the show, go with the Watcher's Guides as they are the definitive sources."
2,Even being the best....,"This book may be the best guide about Buffy around, but this not means that it's a stisfactory product. Because it's not.The enormous volume of pages dealing about parties, whatever, are useless. And, most importanyl, it lacks an index to the world of Buffy, something that would run something like this:""Willow"" - Buffy's best friend. Went from a very shy girl to one one of the most powerful witches in the world, bl√°,bla;""Ethan"" - Gile's old friend from England, when both them, along with some friends, dealed with the black arts. Appeared for the last time in the episode bla, bla, bla...""It would have been a huge task, but that was what I was looking for when I bought this book, and was dissapointed when I did not find it.The part of Angel I don't care, bcause I still did not watch this show (I intend to start buying the DVD sets)."
3,Good if you haven't visited any Buffy Sites,"I really did not find what I was looking for. All the Sarah Gellar bio info is readily available at SMGFAN.COM.Of interest was the portion about the posting board party and some of the author's comments on the episodes. I found the other cast members bios interesting too, but would assume this info is readily available on line as well.If you are on line at Buffy and Sarah Gellar sites all the time, you probably know most of what is in here. Overall, I found ""Watcher's Guide"" to be much more interesting."
4,Edgar Rocks,I like to keep concert DVD's going at my store and Edgar Winter is uniquially entertaining. One of my favorites.
4,Very cute!,My niece put this dress on and danced around forever! The lights change colors and it is very festive. I would recommend for 4 to 6 year old.
3,"Charming, but.....","Mr. Banker is an exceptional story-teller, an artist with words and has wonderful imagination. But, he takes liberties with the original Ramayana as written by Valmiki. It makes for a good read; I liked Banker's Sita and her spunk much more than the traditional one. She comes across as a strong minded girl-woman who tried to take her Destiny in her own hands. Some of the words he uses to convey regional/ ethnic flavor were jarring as the words have Urdu/Hindi base and not Sankrit. So the effect that the saga is from aeons ago is destroyed!I loved seeing Kaikeyi in a completely different light; however I'm puzzled why he needed to make her completely wanton- consorting with strangers? with the palace guards?Manthara and her witchcraft and spellbinding. As also her power over Kaikeyi.A good book overall. With new thoughts and interpretations of the original."
2,not that great,"Listened to this album a few times and can honestly say that it's not that impressive.Many are catergorizing this in the same league as Portishead and Macy Gray but I can't see the similarities in the quality of music or in the voice.If one of these artists or any other top selling soul or R n B artists for that matter put this Cd out, music critics would call it sub standard and unoriginal.It's all a bit too predictable from beginning to end, no surprises and it all starts sounding too much of the same thing when it's all over.I feel her voice is decent, but doesn't strike me as a strong, true soulful voice. The accent is too disracting at times as well.There are worse albums out there, but all I can say is if you want original sounding soul without the predictability, (yawn)stick with Badu, Jill Scott or Joss Stone."
1,QV-3000 Plus USB Software not compatible with Windows ME,I have a QV-3000 Plus digital camera that will not upload photos to Windows ME uning the USB connection. Casio support has recommended returning to Windows 98 full version. My problem is I had upgraded from Windows 3.1 to 98 in steps. Before purchasing the Casio camera I decided to upgrade my computer and moved to Windows ME full version. Casio support will not guarantee that the camera will work as advertised unless the full version of Windows 98 is loaded. I have tried to purchase Windows 98 full version and have been told by retailers that this version is no longer available. So until Casio and Microsoft get their act together I am stuck with a very expensive photo album or paper weight.
3,"Overrated: cool capacity, bad picture quality","The microdrive is definitely a VERY cool thing. The camera itself is very bulky, and the box is made of crappy-looking plastic and has a fragile-looking finish. I was very deceived with the picture quality. For example indoors pictures had a *lot* of moire effect on flat surfaces (wall), like a bad scanner. Details were ok.My conclusion: an expensive toy, but not a high-quality camera."
4,Casio Support & USB connection,In an earlier report I complained that I could not get my Casio camera to communicate with Windows ME. Well we solved the problem.I installed a new hard drive. Loaded Windows ME then the Casio software. Do not let Windows locate the driver. Direct Windows to the Casio drivers and the IBM Microdrive will be identified as an additional hard drive. Plug in the USB cable and you can drag and drop files from the camera to the computer in seconds.I found a Casio support person that has some ideas on loading the drivers. His suggestion infolved removing files etc. We did not remove any files and everything worked as expected. You may contact Glen Crooker at gcrooker@casio.com if you have trouble. He seems willing to help.
1,Wish I could have downloaded pictures,"I was so excited to get this camera...my first step into the digital world of photography! (I am an avid SLR user.) I took some great shots...I think...of my 17 month old daughter only to find that I could not download them to my computer. I called Casio and was on the phone for 2 hours and 15 minutes as they tried to help me figure out what the problem was. I finally asked the service supervisor what she would do. She said ""return the camera"". So I have. I am heartbroken. Casio could not explain why I was unable to download the pictures, but I suspect it has something to do with the fact that I am running Windows ME edition, and the software included with the camera was written for Windows 98!! Now I am back to square one, and have learned not to take any good pictures on my next camera until I know I can actually print them."
3,"Great camera, terrible customer support","I love this camera. Fantastic options, great pictures. The microdrive is wonderful. If you have a great understanding of digital cameras and software, this is a wonderful choice. If you need any type of technical assistance, you are on your own. I called Casio technical support because I wasn't happy with the clarity of the prints on my printer. When asked for suggestions the response was ""Uh Uh I don't know."" When asked if she knew anything about this camera I was told ""Not really"" I then asked to speak to her supervisor and was told, ""They don't know any more about this camera either"". In case I forgot to mention this was Casio's digital camera technical support. Pretty bad on Casio's part."
5,So good that I bought another one!,"This is a great camera for the first time digital user. Batteries were a problem until I started using NMH AA rechargeable batteries. I keep a set in the charger and another in the camera and I am good to go. I can take 40-50 pictures with one charge. The microdrive is fantastic, I pop it out of the camera and into a cf card reader hooked to my computer and presto, it is another drive and the pictures are right there to be viewed, printed, or transferred (fast). It is just hassle free. Quality of the pictures is, to me, indistinguishable from film. I lost the first camera on a trip and was so pleased with it that I bought another one just like it. Can't say enough good about it. Again one of the key factors for satisfaction is getting the proper batteries - with the NMH AA rechargeable batteries which you can get for $10 for a set of four anywhere now, you'll be satisfied with the battery life and the low cost of operation."
2,"Boring, unnecessary","This book may have broken ground when it was written in the mid-60's, but now it reads like a who's who of the old mob. It's written as a chronology of events, not an interesting story. There's no description and no emotion brought into the story, simply ""this is what happened, this is what happened next."" Did not enjoy it."
4,Great Book,This is a well written book.I only noticed some minor things I did not like. If you like books about Italians who are criminals this is the one for you. Serpico was great also
4,Practical introduction to scales for self-taught guitar,"The author does a nice job of presenting scales in an easy to read, visual format. Of particular interest to a busy guitar player who wants to get the essentials quickly."
2,Lame...,"I read some of the reviews for this movie and took a chance on it. This movie was boring, The zombies are lame, The acting is lame, The story was weak. It was a waste of time. I gave it 2 stars just because I like zombie movies and Willis from different strokes plays a retard in it."
1,Todd Bridges comeback?,"First, there is no ""army"" of the dead. There is only one Hispanic family who becomes zombies after being murdrered.Second, Todd Bridges only has a small role as a retarded man with fake buck-teeth and a ""pillow"" or balloon under his shirt to make him look chubby. This is by far the worst and the silliest and the most misleading zombie movie that I have ever seen. Buy this at your own risk. Of course, I rate this movie with one star.Maybe there is a worse zombie movie, but, I can't imagine any film being that much worse than this waste of time and money for the movie buyer and the producers of this nonesense.Bad special effects along with a korny script make this actually painful to watch. I believe this horror movie is even worse than ""The Church""!I thought that movie was the worst horror ever made-I was sadly mistaken"
2,"Strange movie, terrible ending!","The premise of the movie might have been interesting with better writing, acting, and directing. The special effects are okay, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. The ending was just terrible and made no sense at all."
1,Why one star?,"The movie sucks so badly, I want to give it ZERO but the least I can give this wretched film is one star. The fact is that this cheaply-made piece of crap is not worth watching and not worth the money I spent on it. Thank God I was able to trade it in up at Play N Trade. I probably should have doused it in gasoline and send it to hell, but I wanted to get something out of it, since that something wasn't a decent movie experience."
1,Dan's Pics,"The title of this movie should be ""Illegal aliens attack from the Grave."" Not even worth one star. A woman who looks like shes been ""around"" if you know what I mean starts stripping in front of two illegal aliens who rightly reply ""This is what we left Mexico for?"" Back yard movie with poor picture quality and herrendous acting. Show this movie at US/Mexican border cinamas' and you can bet your bottom dollar that this movie alone will secure the Border. Don't waste your money."
1,STAY AWAY !!!!!!,DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE !!!WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY... ALSO WASTE OF MONEY FOR MAKING IT !!!!!
4,MST3K worthy,"This movie is pretty excellent as far as a funny night with friends material goes. Get it, grab some people that will appreciate the B movie hilarity and enjoy."
4,Gripping and Grinning,"Fans of the zombie genre were prepared for the shocks but not the yucks of ""Dawn of the Living Dead."" The movie grips you with horror scenes non pareil then has you grinning with clever bon mots. It's especially useful as the centerpiece of upcoming Halloween parties and could spark a costume theme for revelers. I'll be watching for more from executive producers Barry Strudwick and Whit Hauprich."
2,Be informed,"If you want to hack on things, buy a machete. If you want to cut, get a cheness cutlery piece. This thing is a piece of junk and can easily be snapped after a couple good whacks. Dangerous."
4,surprising...,"I got this on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised by its balance and how sturdy it felt. That being said, I only have it as a novelty item, and don't intend on actually having to fight with it or anything like that. So, if you're careful (to echo some other reviews), this should be a fine blade to play with.One last thing-the sheath is rather annoying on this item in that it always makes a loud scratching noise when you pull the blade out-not ideal for a ""ninja."""
2,You get what you pay for...,"I am a knife collector and I bought this ""sword"" on a whim. Growing up my dad had a name-brand version of this machete (call it what it is, its not a ninja sword), but the higher quality brand isn't made anymore.Pros: 420 steel isn't especially good, but it's not bad either. The blade flexes, but doesn't bend, and it is fairly rust resistant.Cons: the handle wrapping REALLY sucks (I took it off within 10 minutes), some idiot had the dumb idea of stamping some dumb Chinese letters on the blade for the ninja nerds, and the scabbard really sucks.The blade came very dull but that's probably a good thing since most people buying this want it for play, not for cutting through heavy weeds."
5,Great sword,"This is a great sword at a great price. It has a solid blade that easily cuts through wood, and even light metal. I do not recommend it in a fight against a carbon steel blade, but measure for measure this sword is very very good."
4,"not great for the little ones, but interesting for us old ones.","My daughter loves cats, so I thought this would be a fun, educational dvd for her that would satisfy her desire to constantly stare at, hear about, and otherwise be immersed in cats. However, she referred to it as a ""commercial"" and kept asking when the show was going to start. Eventually she wandered off to play. I liked watching it though!"
5,My conure loves it !,"My sun conure just loves it. It is well fabricated, and perfectly sixed for it."
4,Good collection of ambient electronic tracks,"Double CD of ambient style tracks that are favourites of the noted Ambient Soho record shop in London.A great collection of ambient songs, most of which are by artists I'd never heard of before. But I wasn't let down by what I heard.Of what I did know, 'Collage of Dreams' by John Beltran is my favourite, a real soft techno special.Tracks by Sandspider really impressed me too.If you're an ambient techno fan, then this is probably a great collection for you to get hold of."
2,Sloppy seconds,"Brilliant artist (IMHO America's best songwriter) gets own record label;puts out CD 7-8 months after last release;16 tracks, couple just over a minute, one 20 minutes;titles like ""Cocktease"" & ""Cocaine Feet"". Insidiousy, the question forms: Could this be a self-indulgent, ""experimental"",""ragged, down-home"" collection typical of demo/B-side stuff? The answer is, yeah, pretty much. JA is too much a pro to put out pure drivel & this isn't really an unpleasant listen. Just know what you're getting-if looking for the craft, melody, or melancholy beauty of his last 3 CD's, it ain't here-maybe on his next (also expected out in '07), if this own-label thing hasn't gone to his head"
5,but did it make you dance?,"i think the album's great if you don't go into it with your own ideas about how it *should* sound based on his previous work... it's most definitely a departure from that. a welcome one, as far as i'm concerned. another nuclear daydream would have been stale.yeah it's got some weird moments - but diamond ring is one of my favorite songs he's ever done. this album is more about FUN over song structure, which is fine by me. a perfect release in time for a carefree summer."
2,Continuing his downhill slide,"Looks like the Bard from Akron has peaked too early. Has he matched Vacancy or Come to where I'm from? No. He came close on Our Shadows will remain, but no. I saw him live last yeAR--my sixth time seeing him--and it was embarassingly bad.Is this what happens when you move to Los Angeles? Or when you are more interested in self-reinvention than quality songwriting?"
1,No Extra Tracks,"I waited an extra month for this version of the album to come out -- the one that Amazon says has ""Extra Tracks"". Don't be fooled -- there are no extra tracks on this CD. Thanks Amazon!"
2,Poorly done game...,"This is one of those games that was all hype and nothing to back it up. the previews looked amazing but the aftermath is that Orphen has ver dissapointing gameplay. the only good thing about this game was the battles. the battle system was very innovative and fun to learn, however this game will dissapoint even the most hardcore fans of the anime."
4,Orphen,Great game needs a little work with the battle scenes but overall a good buy. A good starter for RPG on the playstation 2
3,"Ok, but not great game","This is a ok game, not the worst game I've played, but certainly not even near the best. The graphics are not very good, but acceptably so. Gameplay is average, and it may take a while to get used to, but it's not hard to get the hang of. There's enough story to keep you going, and different storylines to boot, so replay value is sorta a little above average. Music's ok, nothing special, and sound effects are ok, too.This is a pretty average game overall, so I recommend renting this game first before you consider buying it.Some great RPGs I recommend to just about anybody include the Final Fantasy series, Grandia 2, Chrono Cross, Star Ocean 2, Jade Cocoon 2, and Legend of Legaia, to name a few of my good ones.The Gamin' Girl"
2,The goodness lasted about 15 seconds,"And those 15 seconds was the beautiful PS2 startup screen. Within the first 10 minutes I was in probably the worst battle engine I've ever scene. The reason I bought this game cause it was anime and the first thing you see when you start is an anime sequence, but that was about the only thing that made me happy. I didn't even bother to save the game on to my memory card. Maybe I'll pull this game out on one of those long and i do mean LONG rainy nites where I have already beatin all other games at my disposal and have nothing better to do."
2,annoying little game,"the attemt to make the game exciting by putting a lot of stupid puzzles makes this game a not very fun game at all. the battle system is alright and i like the anime sequences that take place. its rather annoying when you get trhough little puzzles, maze like areas that take you ages to figure out. Im used to the experience points and equiping weapons you bought or forged, since its in most other RPGs that ive played. also the fact that you cant skip movies makes it annoying when you die after watching a long movie because you have to watch it again."
1,Not Much Good Here,"The game is one of the worst games I have ever played. The ""movie"" segments are too long and you cannot skip them. The game requires no thinking. Mostly there is only one path to take and half the time the other characters tell you exactly what to do. All of the ""challenges"" are cheap rip-offs from Tomb Raider. Poor RPG, Poor Adventure Game, Poor attempt at anything."
3,This game is annoying...,"Wow.. I waited.. and waited.. and waited in the Wal-Mart for 6 hours for my PS2.. grabbed the coolest looking game (Orphen).. zipped home, popped it in and..... DISAPPOINTED! This game was clearly rushed to be out at launch. The graphics leave a lot to be desired, and listening to all the conversation is incredibly annoying. I mean, youre like, SHUT UP ALREADY and theres no button to push to get past it. The battles are incredibly easy.. and the bosses dont look very impressive. I dont like how you have to stand still during the battles either.. I liken this game to a bad rip off of Vagrant Story, 3d accelerated. The graphics are boxy and the textures are.. repetitive.. its like a Playstation game except clearer, like putting in a pair of contacts. The story is ok though.. and I haven't gotten that far into it yet, but this game is a definite RENT BEFORE YOU BUY kind of thing.."
3,An RPG masterpiece with very bad production!,Orphen is an RPG with GREAT gameplay because:1- The intro was VERY COOL.2- It contains many animated cinematics.3- The fighting-style is amazing (Not SUPERB as Grandia but much better than Final Fantasy).4- You can see the enemies before you fight them (Just like in Chrono Cross).5- The music is cool.6- It contains voice-acting.7- You can see your friends following you all the time (Just like in Chrono Trigger).8- You don't have to put another names for the characters (Just like in Lunar).9- COOL character desing.Those were the good things but the bad things are:1- Cheap movement for the characters and also for the cinematics.2- The graphics were not all that good.3- You don't have freedom on the map-screen.4- The voices were so-so.5- Poor longivety.
2,This game by far the worst rpg on PS2!!,"I bought this game a few weeks ago and i played it right away.At first it looks cool but it started to repeat itself.The graphics are good as to be expectied of a PS2 game but the gameplay is horrible.The battles are incridibly easy and simple, the story is weak and booreing,and you never leave this island.I stoped playing it after the 3rd time i put about 4 or 5 hours into it and found it to be horribly stupid.Its kinda like a zelda inspired game but it hardly even should be spoken in the same sentence.You should probablly just forget about this game and buy Shadow Hearts which is probablly one of the best rpg's for this console."
3,starting the ps2 rpg game craze orphen,This game has every thing you would think in an opener rpg the graphics are great but the gameplay lackes alot the fighting gets repetative and the game takes you from point a to b to fast i only wish that you had more room in the game to walk around but if you liked the cartoon and followed it this game may jest be for you
1,And I NEVER Hand Out One Star Reviews,"Ok, so maybe it is only once in a great while that I give a one star rating to something, but this game is so vile, and disappointing that I had to.Not only are the graphics sub-par, but the controls are awkward, and the dubbing is the worst I have ever seen... ANYWHERE! At first I thought it was kind of funny that they would start talking before thier mouth moved, and then continued flailing thier arms much after the dialog had stopped, but the humor was soon lost, and it just became a poorly timed marionette show.This is a poor game, I cannot reccomend it to anyone."
1,this game is a coaster,if you buy this game you are buying a drink coaster - it is horrible - the comabat system is horrible - the characters are horrible - the graphics are glitchy and the controls leave much to be desired - THIS IS A LAUNCH GAME - which means it is one of the oldest games out - DO NOT BUY _ buy DARK ALLIANCE INSTEAD
2,Osito -,"I bought this game when I first bought my PS2 and I have to say that it could have been a very good game; however, it seemed very underdeveloped. There was not enough fights, puzzles, and/or point to the game. You spend the entire time collecting powers only to find out that the ones start out with are the ones you need to defeat the game. What is the point? If you must play it rent it."
1,I wish I hadn't bought this game.,"I should have remembered that doing game research before buying usually makes me a happier customer. While the idea of this game seems like it would be cool, the actual game play is really weak. I think I have tried playing it twice. The voices are really bad, and the movements of the characters are painful to watch. This game is awful and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,"This ""game"" is terrible, don't even bother","This game is quite possibly the stupidest game I have ever played. From the first (and ONLY) time I played it, it got on my nerves. The voice acting is terrible and really annoying. In the very beginning on the boat, you walk into a room and the girl whines ""Ohh NOOOO, my jeans are RUINED!"" That did it for me, I just snapped the game off right there. The graphics are bad for the PS2, and the way the characters move is all jerky and repetative. They wave their arms when they talk and then kinda forget to stop waving them after they finally shut up. The combat system not very good, you just stand in one place and idly blast enemies with badly-animated spells. If you see this one on the shelf, don't even give it a second glance, just move on and get something else. ANYTHING can be better than this."
2,Game? This is more like a comic book!,"This game is what's wrong with so called RPG's today, or any game as a matter of fact. In an RPG i thought that it was Role Playing, not some kind of comic book. You just don't play most of this game, you just watch. The battle system is just plain stupid, who just stand there and the enemy's come toward's you. The save points are at the most random spot's of the game and the cut scenes are just horrible, the voice acting to the dubing. And they are BORING, if you die you have to watch them all over again, and you can't skip them. Don't buy this game, watch the anime, it is basicly the same thing!"
2,"Good anime scenes, but lacks alot in game play","When I saw this game I thought maybe this will be a good RPG like the Sega CD game ""Lunar"" which is still my all time favorites that I have played. I quickly bought this game and loaded it up and instantly I got into a anime story. After what seemed like an eternity, I finally got to a battle scene and was greatly disappointed. No experience points/magic points are used so there really is no character to build up like in real RPG's. This is not a real role playing game but more of an action game with a anime story. Don't waist your time and money with this one, wait for something better."
1,Worst RPG ever made?,"Orphen was another prime example of a rushed game that wanted to be a launch title. It contains a little bit of [bad] voice acting at the beginning, then from there they gave up and no one moves their mouth. As for gameplay, it's very limited, pretty boring, and overall lacking. ... I don't even know why they call it orphen. You just live out someone elses adventure as you join their party. The story is one of the worst ever made. ... my point is the story [is bad], and everything else about this game [is bad], it's the ... game that ever ... . Use the disk as it was obviously intended to be used as. A frizbee."
1,boring piece of ...ahem,"yawn...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...wha?......zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...ORPHAN! man o man this game is the worst! i mean come on it can be better, don't be lookin at the cover sayin its good cause its not! ahem, first of which the voice-overs are horrible its one compared to FF10 which is cool, when orphan is well...not! no real faciel expresstions nottin, nada absolutly nothing. get somethin else besides this"
1,Uuugh!,"This one is a severely damaged poop. Kinda like one of those rock hard poo rockets that gets stuck in the launcher and won't come out. The head pops out, but the rest is still stuck in there, that's about the gist of this Poo-filled adventure. Scion of Poop, Sh*tMaster is my new tittle. Poo-filled diasaster!"
2,"Not terrible, but not really good either","This movie is an interesting take on the vampire genre, but I feel like it could have been better done. The movie tries to surprise you, but really you pretty much always know what is going to happen. Despite the cool concept, it fails to be too interesting. It does have a few good moments though. And, although it isn't a comedy, it definitely had a few moments that had my friends and I laughing hysterically. I guess that isn't really a good thing, but it adds to the enjoyment nonetheless.In my opinion, what it really comes down to with this movie is; if you are a big fan of vampire movies you should probably rent it and have a few friends over who won't take it too seriously. If that doesn't sound appealing to you, I'd say skip it. You wont be missing too much. I don't really recommend buying it unless you find it dirt cheap. Chances are you will be satisfied seeing it once. And heck, if you see it and you love it, good for you and go right ahead and buy it."
2,Another reluctant vampire?,wow . . . another vampire who doesn't want to be. Boo f'n hoo. We're running out of blood cause we can't figure out how to breed humans? Really? Weak. Don't waste your time.
2,"Interesting concept, but then fails to ""Break Away"" from the rest of the genre","I didn't expect much from this film, so I wasn't too disappointed. The concept intrigued me: What if the whole world, except for a small minority of humans became vampires? I enjoy good vampire and monster movies, but this movie reminded me too much of ""Resident Evil"" meets ""Blade"". The plot felt like a regurgitation of so many earlier movies of this genre and the concept digressed into a very familiar setting. While I enjoyed many parts of the movie, taken as a whole the story became too predictable and the special effects and gore went over the top. In the end, ""Daybreakers"" couldn't break away from the modern day stereotypical Hollywood vampire movie and was anything, but unique. This movie is possibly worth renting, but not purchasing or viewing a 2nd time."
3,BLOOD IS THE LIFE,"Vampire movies have certainly evolved since Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee. The trend of late is to romanticize them (TWILIGHT) or make them heroic victims, and as in this case, good vs bad vampires. As so, this movie is a passable entry. The cure is the curse! There are some imaginative ideas executed, buoyed by a strong cast: Sam Neill, Ethan Hawke and Willem Dafoe in particular.I still prefer the ""classic"" vampires but this one sure beats the glamour of the Twilight trash."
3,An Okay movie.,"Daybreakers looked like a blade ripoff. The movie has a very different feel however. First its a little simpler than blade and easier to follow. The story follows a vampire who doesnt want to be a vampire. He sympathizes with humans, as he used to be one, and refuses to drink human blood. Instead he tries to find a substitute while his boss, Sam Neill, focuses entirely on getting more humans to feed on. The gore in this movie is way over the top and silly. The ending scenes focused on a massive blood orgy of violence that rivaled in ridiculousness to that Samuel L. Jackson movie about the spaceship (the name escapes me at the moment.) Its an interesting concept but unfortunately it was not given enough time. The characters are underdeveloped and seem almost empty. Not a terrible film but not a great one either."
4,A Different Vampire Movie,"I chose this rating because I'm a vampire fan, and this movie was pretty cool.This was an interesting twist on the vampire genre seeing it more as a plague that humans contracted, though it's not really explained fully how the plague was created or started. I liked how this movie showed the vampires the way most if not all of us are familiar with them - staying out of the sun because they'll burn up, they have fangs and hypnotizing eyes, they have no reflection in mirrors, they can be killed with a wooden stake in the heart - you get the idea. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, so just watch this movie and enjoy. But be careful, it's a bit bloody. Well, it's a vampire movie. ;)I recommend this movie to any vampire fan. Like me, you may want this one in your collection. ^v^ have funnnnn ^v^"
3,INTERESTING EVOLUTION OF VAMPIRE SOCIETY--SAME OLD CORPORATE SOCIETY,"Vampires live in a world where they are the majority and humans are the minority. Humans are captives and are, basically, farmed and ""milked"" for their blood. But the blood supply is threatened because of human population decline. Ethan Hawke is a vampire scientist researching a ""cure"" for this blood supply shortage--artificial blood. But an inexpensive, easily accessible supply of blood threatens corporate interests. Sound familiar?I can only give this movie 3 stars. I liked watching it, but I wouldn't watch it again. It was just OK."
2,"A very different story about vampires, but not entertaining at all with very little action","I had watched many movies but so far I could not recall one with a background setting similar to this, that 95% of the world's population are vampires that they hunt and farm humans. Think of an empty modern city in day time but very busy with heavy traffic at night, and human like (except their yellowish eyes) vampires easily deteriorated into ugly bat like monsters which lost their mind after blood starvation for two weeks. The setting is interesting. The movie is not. Perhaps I expected an action packed thriller but what I got is much talk with very little action. Quite boring indeed, though I like Evan Hawke and Willem Dafoe much. Not recommended, not even for a rental!"
1,"Good idea, lots of gore but little plot","Response after watching the movie: ""What a waste.""The concept is good, but the plot was almost missing and they made it a gore fest instead. It's too bad. This could have been a great movie."
2,Eh,It was good enough to finish watching once. But I wouldn't touch it again. Glad I waited until it was free on TV before seeing it too. Not worth any amount of money to rent it.
5,Great movie,This movie was better than I expected! Both Ethan Hawke and William Dafoe were great in this. Would recommend for any vampire lover!!
4,Doesn't suck,"One of the more interesting and original vampire movies I've seen (and I've seen quite a few). When the population of vampires - who infect their victims who then return as additional vampires - reach a tipping point, the population of ""herd"" humans becomes dangerously low and endangers the continued existence of the now-majority vampire population. The story line appears to be attempting to make a comparison with rampant consumerism, energy shortage, and peak oil, and it works rather well, if perhaps a bit heavy-handed in spots. There is, of course, the traditional ""ebil korporate ceo"" played well with his usual ""cool evil"" by Sam Neill (a vampire, of course) who goes so far as to have a minion ""turn"" his own daughter who has resisted becoming a vampire."
4,A vampire tale of a different kind,"This is kind of a new vampire polt line, close to one used in Blade. Instead of people outnumbering the vampires, they outnumber us. Ending is not predictable. Over all I'd recommend this movie."
4,Most original vampire movie in a long while,"The plot of this movie is simple. It is the near future and a plague has taken over the world; a plague that turns humans into vampires. The few uninfected humans are chased as food. The movie focuses on a vampire scientist who encounters a man who used to be a vampire, and who chanced upon a cure that turns vampires back into humans. The race is then on to spread this cure to the rest of the world. The movie features a cast of well-known actors; actors known for serious roles, and they don't disappoint in this movie. Being rated R, there a occasional scenes of violence, gore, and bad language, but no more than say the Underworld movies. The dialog is very good, and the special effects are just enough to keep things believable. Overall, probably the best vampire movie of the past decade or so."
3,Great idea with an average outcome,"The idea for the movie was great. Though you can tell it was influenced by several other movies it was still very original. The acting in it, though not top notch, was more then adequate. The graphics in the movie was probably its strongest point. Good atmosphere and kill scenes. With all of that said, good as the movie was it wasn't great. Some scenes seemed awkward. Like the ones between Ethan Hawke's character Edward Dalton and his brother Frankie Dalton.So if you like Vampire movies then you really should see it just don't expect anything mind shattering."
4,Good vampire movie,"It is 2019 and the planet is ten years into the infection of a virus that has turned humans into vampires. There are only a small number of humans remaining, and the vampires hunt them in order to harvest their blood. A vampire blood scientist who disagrees with the consumption of human blood is trying to find a blood substitute. He encounters a group of people who are hiding out and he teams with them in order to attempt to find a way for the humans to be able to no longer live in fear. This is a very effective science fiction mystery, with engaging players, not simply stock characters to be sacrificed for entertainment. The film is gory at times, but not overly so. This is solid entertainment for moviegoers who are not too sensitive to the sight of blood onscreen."
3,I know its not great,"To be honest I got this film to stare at Ethan Hawk, he does look so good in this movie. It's not the worse vampire movie out there, but its not the best. Over all its very fun to watch if you are into action sci fy."
3,A very good Vampire movie....finally,Some of the movies comming out this year are pretty good indeed. Less stupid violence and gore and better scripts and execution.This movie felt like a big budget movie. The subject was very interesting whichmade the movie very watchable. Quite a twist in this one....a big part of earth'spolulation are now vampires...that need human blood....or they start changingin something a little more nasty....any humans left.....to feed the population.The answers lies in the movie...Entertaining...and cant wait for a sequel to this story.A keeper.
4,"Started out great, middle was good, fizzled at the end","I was so psyched to see this movie after remembering the previews. With all these teenage vampire movies and shows going around this had an actual good storyline (sorry Twilight fans). The whole idea was very original and the characters were selected very wonderfully. The beginning was awesome, the middle got mysterious and spine tingling and the end... well, the end felt like they already used up all the good fireworks and all they had left were sparklers. Overall, the few dollars was well worth it. And overall, it was a good movie, just saying it could have been great if the end was put together in a bit more clever manner."
2,"Not your typical vampire movie.. alright, but lacking...","This is an interesting take on the vampire/horror genre. The vampires are the majority and the remaining humans cannot supply enough blood to keep the masses from turning into their hideous sub-species. There are many attempts by the main character (Hawke) to find a cure for vampirism, as living forever is now not what it is all cracked up to be. He is against drinking human blood and human farming, but it must be done. He hates the company he works for, like many of us do!There is plenty of gore, but it's not really scary. A nice gross-out scene pays homage to The Exorcist, it seems. There is a huge bloodbath close to the finale where literally no one involved in the scuffle is left alive.I am giving it only 2 stars because it suffers from being a bit too long and dragged out toward the ending. It's worth a rental if you are into vampires and plenty of blood and gore.Thank you for reading..."
2,Oceans of blood spurting in the air,"Not a whole lot to redeem this vampire flick - way too much blood and gore. Good if you like overkill on the blood and gore. Bad if you prefer something more realistic. Realistic for vampires, that is. I preferred the Underworld series and Van Helsing, for example."
3,Unique Story,Daybreakers was a unique vampire story... not cookie-cutter like so many vampire stories that have been told in the last 5 years or so. The acting was OK.
3,Great action,This movie was great in action & had it's expected Gore factor. But when it came to the story line. I felt that itcould have been better when it came to that. I did however; like the fact that the story was set in the near future. But was left hanging when it ended. It started out slow but gradually picked up. But all in all it was a pretty good flick. But not something I would see again.
3,Good change on vampires.,This was a different type of story on vampires but it was a very slow movie. There were several times I almost shut it off because nothing was happening but watching a character think their way through something. I liked that Sam Neills' character got his just rewards in the end and the way the disease was going to be cured but would not have purchased this movie if I had rented it first.
3,Terrible Vampire Movie,"I think I am old school. Give me a break! Vampire with a PhD is no vampire. Vampires are evil driven by animal instinct. They don't think. There is no reason to what they do. they just do! On the other hand, the story is pretty good with very good sci-fi element. The movie has a pretty good pace but I think the ending is kinda cheesy as a vampire movie.This is more or less just a sci-fi action flick. Nothing special."
2,Well Pleased,Dealing with Amazon was a smooth sale and got quick service and they were there for me after the sale.Which is very inportant when purchasing anything.A satisfy transaction.
2,I wish she had gone further,"I was disappointed. She concentrated strongly on a few already well known ladies in waiting up to Queen Anne, then the whole book just trailed off with much less attention given to each succeeding Queen's ladies. It was very clear where her real expertise is."
1,Dumb and boring,No offense but this book should have never been published. Don't even waste your money. In it you have Ebony and Ivory(twins). Ebony is a popular girl and Ivory is a nerd. Anywayz Ebony starts to crush on a smart guy named Charles. So she asks her sister to switch places with her so she can get to know him better. This story could have been good but it was anything but that. The storyline was interesting enough but wasn't written well. It was boring and unexciting. Usually books transport me to another world. This one couldn't even hope to keep my attention for more than 2 minutes. All it did was leave me thinking you couldnt pay me to read this again
1,The Un-Popular Book,"Hey, when I first saw this book in the store, I thought it looked cool cause I usually look for books with black people on the cover and it had an interesting plot. Then, I read the reviews for this story, and they said the book was bad, but I didn't believe it. Now, I do. This book was horrible. The beginning was long and boring, the ending was short and chopped out, and I got lost in between. There were a lot of questions left unanswered...the Big Think issue..the school play..I mean, I don't even know for sure if these people hooked up in the end! Whatever you do, don't buy this book. This was the worst Love Stories I've ever read. If you wanna read a good one, read Snag Him! or Jake and Christy."
2,"Give me a break, this CD sucks!!","First of all, I am a MAJOR Venom fan, and I was VERY dissappointed with this album! While hints of the classic Venom sound can be found here and there, the majority of the material reeks of 90's ""Macho Rock"", aka Panterrible. Rather than do what they do best, it sounds like they are trying not to sound ""out of date"". The result is mediocore at best. The speed and raw energy of the early albums is long gone, and 1997's ""Cast in Stone"" is far better than this poor excuse for a Venom record. After such a great comeback like ""Cast in Stone"" I expected much more from Venom, I didn't get it.So, if you like trendy, macho ""power groove"", then you might like this drivel. If you are a REAL Metal fan, save your money for the Venom reissues."
3,more detail needed,It would be helpful if the description were more complete--it is not 100% angora as would be implied by the title
5,Hot set of 10 tracks.,"At first I was uneasy about buying the ablum, only 10 tracks strong. But it was more of a ""Strong"" album than a ""10-track"" album. Track ""Bad Man"" is the radio hook that convinced me to give Murs a try, and he was worth the investment.Every lyric has me holding on to them like I lived the rhyme, ultimately because of his ingenious truthful set of of opinionated works. HE DOESN'T HOLD ANYTHING BACK. And plenty of listeners will find themselves agreeing with a lot of things he said on the album. Fabulous underground album, and 9th Wonder being the producer makes the already great material, an excellent album."
2,"I love Murs, but...","Stop. 9th Wonder is incredibly overrated. Yes, Little Brothers 'The Listening' was hot...but this is just average. Murs brings what he brings as usual but 9th's production is watered down and mediocre. The album has its high points but not many. I would definitely check out any other Murs albums other than this one."
3,If 9th is producing... ( 3.5 ),"...you can't go wrong. I slept on this album for the simple fact I didn't have a clue who Murs was. I kind of stumbled upon it, and saw that 9th Wonder was the producer. I knew it was a must have despite having only 10 tracks. The production was ( surprisingly ) only mediocre. Comparing it to LB's The Listening. Well..there is no comparison. Lets just say, you can tell 9th is saving the dope beats for Little Brother. Murs rhymes are elementary, but overall his flow is decent. My favorite track on the album is "" Animal "" feat. MC Phonte of Little Brother. In my opinion this isn't a "" must have "", but if you have 9th Wonder on your radar like me, definitely cop it."
5,Classic Material but 4.5 stars,"This is a hot album. Definitely a hot album. Only ten songs but if there was more songs, it could have fallen to the waste side. You do not have to skip a track. I really do not have a bottom song. but I'll give a rundown just for critic points.Top 3 Songs: HUSTLER, The Animal, 3:16Bottom Song: Pain"
4,an unbiased review,"With an album that is only ten tracks, short, and by a man with impecable flow, its hard not to compare it to nas's illmatic. Although this cd falls short of Illmatic(almost all cd's will) its a few tracks away from reaching that lever, and it is apparent that murs has the capability to be that good ina few years. Perhaps the biggest similarity between nas and murs, and murs best talent, is the storytelling used in the songs. Its refreshing to hear an artist use their gift towards something actually worth listenin to.My personal favorite track on this cd is bad man. It has the perfect combination of beat and flow.Murs also has the talent to keep the listener interested, keeping every track unique. the (th wonder lays down the beats, and Murs lays down the stories. The songs range from powerful(walk like a man), and damn funny(Trevor an' Them. Murs brings a new meaning to the word ""real""."
4,Murs + 9th Wonder = A Great Combination,"I was introduced to Murs through this CD, as an avid Justus League listener, I have bought anything and everything with LB in the credits. Murs is quite amazing, and a refreshingly different MC. In iTunes, all the songs except two have 4 star ratings ... and I've just recently bought ""Murray's Revenge"" as well (chapter two in this hopefully continuing partnership) from Murs' new label Record Collection. My favorite tracks on this CD are: ""The Pain"" ""Bad Man"" and ""The Animal (featuring Phonte)"" and the ""Intro"" track, which is not an interlude at all. Give this CD a shot, you will not be dissatisfied."
5,Best hip hop album of 2004 so far...,"This is almost a EP clocking in around 35 mins, but whatever it is its DOPE. This LA underground MC is definitely putting it down with his cinematic storytelling with 9th wonder on the boards his sampling style is reminiscent of early Pete rock and even a little DJ Premier...2 of the forefathers of creative sampling. Like someone else mentioned ""Freak these tales"" is a very rememorable song very infectious joint along with ""HUSTLE"",The Animal,Intro & The Pain are all the essence of dopeness. Cop this album its something SERIOUS!!"
4,IMPRESSIVE COLLABO!,BOTTOM LINE:This CD gave both of them some nice shine!It was actually the first time I heard of 9th and Murs. Both on top of their game. 9th Wonder goes on to be one of the hottest producers in rap and Murs solidifies his rep as a killer emcee.Nice collabo!
4,good,"i really like this album but i think the murs revenge is more consitant than this,anyway mur is great and knowin damn well only 9th can do this.9th you got it"
5,Don't Listen to the Naysayers,"This is one of the best CDs that I have ever heard. If you can listen to the entire CD and not even think of skipping a track, then that is rare and special. Every song is equally spectacular, so in that way it reminds me of Illmatic. This is definately a classic, and I slept on it, but when I got it, I couldnt be happier. Pick this one up today and suppost a real hip hop artist."
2,If you love Perry Como like I always did.,This was a very poor effort to reveal the talents and showmanship that Perry Como became so famous and loved for by all of his and my generation. And I had been searching all my life for a documentary on the life of this beloved singer that would continue the remembrance of an artist that gave meaning to the word LOVE. Such a pitty.
4,moving short stories that are gracefully written,"I'm not usually an avid reader of the short story format. I generally find that I'm not satisfied with the character and plot development that happens in such a brief space of words, despite a more condensed writing style and other techniques adopted by authors. In this collection of stories, however, Marly Swick has managed to write in a simple and straightforward, but convincing manner about people facing their own personal troubles."
2,I'm disappointed,"Wow, this is a brief presentation! Einstein's theories of relativity (both special and general) get four pages -- and this includes a bio. The period from Plato to Kepler (about 2000 years) gets all of fourteen pages. I can only assume we're supposed to know all this stuff already, because one couldn't become more than introduced to names given the author's treatment of the topics. On top of this, many ""facts"" are plain wrong. E.g., the author claims that Hans Bethe knew nothing of his name's addition to the famous Alpha-Beta-Gamma (Alpher-Bethe-Gamow) paper (p. 61). Not true.There are many much better presentations of this material; for one, see Singh's _Big Bang_. It's better researched and a lot more thorough."
1,Not for Beginners,"Book is great for the history of holley carbs. But not so great for rebuilding your average holley carb. To much info on ""high-tech"" holley carbs. I bought this book thinking it would help me rebuild and tune my 600 cfm holley carb. But all I did was waste my money."
2,No help here for a rebuild.,"Look elsewere for a guide to help you rebuild. I guess this book would be useful if you are a racer or something, but not for the DIY engine tinker-er."
2,Antiquated Information,Copyright is 1999. Information on carburetors newer than this or tuning concepts newer than this are not available in this book.
5,Great story :)),This is one of those books I read as a child that stuck with me forever. I still cite it as one of my favorite books of all time. I still have it on my book shelf and am hoping that my son will one day enjoy it too. I highly recommend it for any child who likes to read ghost stories.
5,Kewl book,"I read this book when I was around 6 or 7 and it is still vivid in my memory more than a decade later. I can't think of another book that has had that effect on me. I would recommend it to anyone. I'm picky about what I let my nieces read, but I would definitely encourage them to read this book."
4,stonewords,"I thought it was a good book . It had a wonderful beginning, a good middle, and an interesting end. It was about a girl who lived with her grandma and grandpa. She lived on a farm. My favorite part was when the ghost died and the girl found out that was her life.The ghost lived in the imaginary upstairs room. The only people who saw the upstairs were the girl and her dog."
3,Mani Neumeier & Peter Hollinger - 'Monster Of Drums-Live' (ATM),"Similar to Mani Neumeier's (founder of Guru Guru) 'Privat' release (see my review). Sixteen track, often hard-to-find German import title. Cuts here I appreciated the best were ""Sunda"",""Hackselmaschine"" (likely way too experimental for most),""Der Grune Treibt"" and maybe ""Lumumba"". I realize much of this probably sounds like Greek to a lot of you. But take it from me,'Monster...' is strictly for MAJOR percussion/drum enthusists only. Not even sure if Guru Guru completists would get that much from it."
1,if only there was less than a 1 star,"This isn't even remotely close to being Ichigo's swords. First off, the handle should be wrapped in white cloth, not red plastic. second, the blade should be multi-toned, not plain steel. This isn't even worth buying just to throw into a river."
4,"Mr Holmes, meet Minnesota","This 212 page book is a well written story revolving around Holmes 'visit' to the far western MN county of Traverse, specifically, the town of Browns Valley. There are two main plot lines. One involves the real controversy over the county courthouse in 1886. The other plot line involves a fictional set of murders. The book is historical fiction and meant as an introduction to both Minnesota history as well as Sherlock Holmes for children. As an adult, the book is still very enjoyable and can be covered in a long afternoon. There are lengthy appendecies at the end of the work that detail what is fiction, and what is fact. Check out a longer review on monkeyrivertown.com under the books section of ""monkey brains"". CDF"
4,"pictures, history and buyers' advice","There are an awful lot of fantasy writers who would benefit in reading, if not this book, then one very like it. But that's not a recommendation.I had the first edition, lost it, discovered the 2nd edition, was happy. Even if you're not a gem-shopper (I'm not), the book's worth it for the zillions of full-color photographs alone: you can *see* what all these gemstones look like.Arem discusses carats vs. karats, gem-cutting, mining, trivia and lore on various gemstones...a lot. There are other books on the same subject, of course, but this one's a decent survey."
5,Serious study of a serious problem,A sad saga of how a well-intentioned medical breakthrough went badly awry. A great piece of investigative journalism.
3,Incorrect Ad,"We specifically ordered this flag because it was supposed to come WITH the pole. It came without one. The price, however, was cheaper, reflecting the fact that it was only the flag. This item description and price needs to be corrected."
5,short but oh so very sweet,"the movie itself is pretty short... 20 minutes... i was kinda mad about that at first because its so beautiful and i wanted it to be longer... but then i watched the ""making of"" feature, and the artist painted everything by finger... so i understand why it was so short... amazing piece of animation... pick it up..."
3,poorly authored DVD,"I was thrilled when this DVD came in the mail, but what a huge disappointment it was when I put it into the player! It:-Has no subtitles at all, not even in English-Is not widescreenTo make things worse, I've found that some people don't like this kind of animation. I like it, but I had to turn it off because no one else in the room liked it."
3,Seems like a good player,"I got the M-270 for Christmas. At first I was disappointed with the sound quality; with the volume all the way up, the sound output seemed really low. In a quiet room, it really wasn't that bad. I think that the sound quality depends upon the DVD inserted. This unit really shined when portable speakers are attached; I got really cool surround sound! I also was disappointed with the wide screen capablities. When a wide screen movie is played, the image is distorted as it fills the entire screen; the actors' images are a bit squashed. Using the non-wide screen button produces a normal looking image but you get a black band around the picture which isn't that bad.I don't what the long term longevity of machine will be, but it seems to be well made."
1,Horrible Longetivity,"I purchased the dvd player on Nov 28, 2003 and on Dec 31, 2003 it no longer reads that a dvd has been placed in it.I can not stress enough to spend the extra cash on a better portable dvd player and not go with this cheapy."
3,a little dissapointed,"I purchased this unit about a week ago. I have to admit I was a little dissapointed. The output is weak. You really need headphones to take advantage of all of the DVD's capabilities. Which, this unit has alot of capabilities for the price (most, I probably won't use). The DVD door is very cheap. I have to slam it shut approx 5-7 times before it stays shut. It is lightweight w/o the battery. The picture is OK.... I've seen better; the sound with headphones is excellent.... I'll give it that. But that's it....I am looking into purchasing another unit and returning this one.... For the money, I was dissapointed."
2,not quite portable dvd,"I find it difficult to use this DVD in a car. I tried to buy a car adaptor for the DVD, but had no luck. The DVD needs a 9 volt 2 AMP adatpor, which is not avaliable anywhere unless if you are willing to spend more than $100 for it. The other problem is that the audio output is too weak. In a car, once you start enegine, you can't hear anything from the DVD. So, you have to use a head phone. Another trouble I had was to output the video signal from the DVD to a TV in hotel. The audio sounds metallic, and the video looks severely distorted. I think this DVD is probably good if you use it at home with a head phone, not on the road."
2,Buyer Beware!,I bought two of these for my kids - one didn't work out of the box and the scond stopped working within the first 6 months. Buyer Beware
3,ALMOST 4 Stars,"I say almost, because mine just broke the other day. But for the past 8 months my girlfriend and I have used and enjoyed the m280 so much, we dubbed it ""the precious"" (watched Lord of the Rings on it while traveling-a lot!). I looked for a while before I bought this particular model: for the price, the picture can't be beat! I may just buy another one. You definitly need a back-up battery. And use headphones or port. speakers. All in all mine was worth the $179.99 I paid."
1,Disappointed,I purchased this in December. Now it's March and it doesn't recongnize when a disk is trying to load. It also would not easily open. Keep your warrantly info!!
2,Buy something else,"This actually has lots of great features when it works. However it has some glitch with the screen. Occasionally, the screen won't work, messing with the power cord will sometimes make it work again, but a new product shouldn't need that. We also had trouble with the button that opens the disk place won't work. We have returned one and are working on our second, had it not been a gift, we would chuck it and get a new one. Just save yourself the grief and try another model/brand."
4,Fine for the price,"I was about to buy the 5"" Panasonic, but in the end decided the screen was too small for the price. So far, the AMW seems fine. The picture quality is OK, and the sound is loud enough with headphones. Given that some people have had quality problems, I did purchase an extended warranty.By the way, you can fix the aspect ratio problem some others are reporting by pressing the ""Set Up"" button on the remote _when no DVD is inserted_. The first ""Set Up"" menu is the ""General Setup Page."" Under ""TV Display,"" change the setting from ""Normal"" to ""Widescreen."" I have no idea why widescreen is not the default, given that the aspect ratio of the physical screen is widescreen. Its also puzzling why they don't make this adjustment explicit in the manual.As others have noted, the player should also include an auto adapter."
1,HORRIBLE RELIABILITY AND QUALITY,I bought one just before Christmas and it never worked quite right. You would load a disc and the player would not recognize that you had loaded it. At first you would just open the lid and try again and it would load. This problem got worse until it no longer worked. I returned it for another and got it home and the screen would show nothing but white. I have seen this on LCD screens before and it usually means the cable in not attched to the board. NOT IMPRESSED. Called for RMA and the phone system sends you to never never land. E-mailed and no reply!! I am hosed I think!!! I wish American companies still produced consumer electronics. I would pay the 20% to have them made here.
1,Troubles,"I got this same AMW Portable DVD player for Christmas last year. It lasted only 2 months, more or less. I experienced the same problems as other reviewers here: it wouldn't recognize the DVD disc/movie. It became a blank screen, or just turned into an MP3 player other than a DVD player, as it was intended.Since I got this as a Christmas gift, my sister seached all over to find the receipt w/warrenty so I can take it in to get it fixed. That happened last week, finally. They let me trade it in for another portable DVD player instead of trying to fix it. I chose Initial. So far, so good.If you choose this, at least get a warrenty."
1,A Speck of Nonsense,"This book is terrible. While initially appearing a beginner's introduction to Earth's place in the cosmos, it becomes evident very quickly that the author has almost no understanding of modern science, the laws of physics or the scientific method.He does not let his lack of understanding prevent him from both picking and choosing which bits of science to accept, which bits to ignore, and speculate wildly about everything else.Enjoy the cute little graphics, and ignore the words. They are far too often, nonsense non-science, misleading and plain wrong."
4,Great Work Of Fiction,"Although skeptical at first, I found this book to be an excellent work of World War Two fiction. It is both fast paced and fast reading and is one of the few books of this type that I have read to the end."
5,"A grand ""debut"" unique in its kind.","Very few times you find a book that makes you wish you were part of the action. Very few stories have characters that you wish you knew them. There are very few authors that can write such novels...Why isn't Mr Heywood writting anymore? ""The Berkut"" is such a novel that you cannot take sides. Both sides, the Russian and the German have courage, stealth, motivation, and all the makings of soldiers whose loyalties to their leaders are unquestioned...even if their leaders are Stalin and Hitler respectively. A grand ""debut"" unique in its kind. A great novel."
5,One of the best in this genre,"I have read many books in this genre, Higgins, MacLean, Follet, Forsyth, etc., but this may be the best and definitely is one of the best. Great characters, well thought out plot, and convincing details. Look at other reviews. There aren't many but it is rare to see such a high concentration of enthusiastic reviews."
5,Why wasn't this author wildly successful?,"I found this book used and apparently forgotten in a small bookstore and have ever since been inflicting it on whichever friend will sit still long enough to be pitched the plot. Relatively simple, it is none the less as good a factional/fictional World War II thriller as I have found. That it doesn't conform to the sort of mold Newt Gingrich thinks of for that genre is only another strike in its favor If it is at all possible to locate this book, it is one to hold and prize"
5,Sailor Calligraphy Pen,"I admit it... I'm a fountain pen fanatic. I am still in a job where I use actually write all om my charts and notes, so I am a stickler for a good fountain pen. The sailor pen with it's steel nib is a pleasure to use. A calligraphy nib is flexible and responds to pressure against the paper and writing angle to vary the width of the line. This is a flexible and very responsive nib!! I is as good as the 14K and 18K nibs I have on other pens. Adding the looks, the modest price and balance to the formula equals a winner. Buy this pen for the sheer fun of writing as it is supposed to be."
5,Comfort food - hard to find in VA,"Spanish peanuts were my Father's favorite; therefore they became mine. I was able to get them in my old age for awhile, but they disappeared from the shelves of Northern Virginia groceries. I went with the flow for awhile, but eventually got smart and looked to Amazon.com. I was rewarded for my intelligence for I now have my Spanish Peanuts whenever I desire. I am also super happy that Planters uses Sea Salt. Thank you, Suzi"
4,Snacks,"My wife and I eat these things like peanuts! You can't eat just one, you know! Planters is the best and buying them from Amazon makes it simple. They're cheaper and delivered to my door on a specified schedule. We never run out like we used to and finding these in the stores is not always as easy as one would think! Yeah - GREAT!"
2,This is about my last order,The last order for Planters Redskin Spanish Peanuts that you sent us was the ones with sea salts. I orderthese Redskins for my wife. She says they are not as good. I will not order any more peanuts if the sea saltsare all that you carry now. The only reason we order from you folks is because the old redskins are hardto find in our local stores. The ones I ordered had the red label. The ones with sea salt have a brown label.
4,Great Resource For Games Designers,"This book covers all of the fundamentals for a games designer. The content is mostly theory and doesnt give many examples of design templates, but having worked for both EA and Acclaim I have come to realise that design templates are rarely alike in different companies and learning them is more a case of gaining experience at a particular company. I would certainly say that this book teaches, someone wanting to become a games designer, everything that a book can teach you."
2,Not for Professional Game Developers...,"As you can read from many of the other reviews this book is simply a collection of e-mail interviews the author had with a large number of people in the game development industry. There is not much text that strings the interviews together.While the book may be interesting to those who are new to the industry, it is not for more experienced game designers. The unfortunate thing about most of the interviews is that they are fairly brief and never really seem to get to the heart of the matter."
5,A must reading for potential converts!,"A History of the Jews was only the second book on Jews that I had read; the first was ""A History of God,"" which made me curious about them. Paul Johnson's book, however, provided the information I needed to set ""my record"" straight before I even contemplated converting to Judaism. This book also enabled me to identify and examine my own anti-semitism, so embedded in my psyche since youth that I was oblivious to it. By the end of the book I realized that some of the stereotypes of Jews are grounded in fact, although popular conceptions distort the underlying basis of that origin. This book is a must reading, not only for potential converts, but for anyone open to examining their personal views of Jews and Judaism."
4,LImited in scope,"This is not exactly a history of the Jews. What it is, however, is a history of Jews in the Western world -- and an excellent one, at that. You should know, however, that the book is not comprehensive. It is a narrative history, and it reads like a story. There are no subsections that explain cultural, religious, or linguistic topics -- just a plodding narrative. If that is what you are after, this is a great book for you."
4,A Dearth of Information in One Book!,"This is probably the most comprehensive history of the Jewish people out there contained in a single book. It contains an overview of the biblical record and covers the diaspora, medieval period, foundings of Zionism, the Holocaust as well as a decent description of the events leading up to problems in the Middle East that endure to this day. It is definitely not light reading, however, and events are not always described in chronological order. For these reasins I only gave it 4 stars, but it deserves a strong 4.5."
2,Agree With Seattle Reader,"I found this book very informative, however, I too disliked Johnson's tendency to lapse into the polemical at times. His treatment of the Palestinian question is extremely one sided, and I was also very offended at the way he belittled Jewish leftists by claiming that such people (eg. Trotsky, Rosa Luxembourg, et al.) ""weren't really"" Jews."
3,Disappointing.....,"This is a superbly written resource. No doubt about that. But that is really all it is. I'm not sure why Johnson bothered to write it. There is nothing new here. No insights that offer a clearer perspective on Jewish history. Its approach derives entirely from the mindset of the intellectual High Church establishment, so Paul Johnson is careful not to judge, not to offend, but also not to stick his neck out. As to the meaning behind the amazing Judaic phenomena - who knows what that is? This great historian apparently isn't concerned. But then again he is a professed ""Christian"" so maybe he feels the answers are self-evident."
4,"Good, but 100% biased","I read this good book, here in Brazil.This book describes the history of jews since thousands of years ago, until some decades ago.The main problem of this book is to be very biased.Critics to jews are almost never showed.The jews seems to be (almost)ever correct.In Roman Empires, the author shows the jewish revolt as a failure, but he forgets the fact, that revolt wasn't just a bloodfull failure, but also a mistake.The massive support of famous and powerfull jews to communism(many countries), eugenics(many countries, including Germany) and racism (in USA) has no place, in this book.Please, I'm not an anti-semithist, but all peoples have its defects, criminals,etc.This book is good, but 100% biased."
2,More a love letter than a history,"Mr. Johnson's book is an easy read, intended mainly for ""the choir"" it sometimes seems. He does make a mess early on with his references to Jewish scriptures, which is not encouraging.What I found quite disturbing as a non-Arab, non-Muslim person living in the Mideast is Johnson's evident ignorance of much of the history of the Byzantines, Arabs and Turks in our part of the world. He seems almostly blithely unconcerned about the historical fact that Palestine was a gentile area for most of the past 1,500 years with only a tiny sliver of Jewish population, and for the previous five hundred years a very ethnically mixed. Facts of no little importance. His history of the Jews in the Mediterranean and Europe was interesting, but I continued to wonder...how accurate? His treatment of the history of the Mideast was so peculiar that I could not have too much faith in the rest of his book.It's a love letter, and love letters are love letters not history."
1,PJ knows what he's talking about. And maybe two others.,"If you already have an extensive knowlege of Jewish history, the location of ancient cities and tribes, and of world history and empires, than you'll love this book. If not, you'll be lost quite often. Paulie tends to assume you know things like what the ""Second Commonwealth"" is. If you do, I'm impressed. He hints about an exile, then moves on, then, five pages later, starts referring to the ""Exile"" without actually talking about it. He mentions a character who ""was quite fascinating"" then tells you nothing about him. By page 150 I'd felt like throwing the book out the window 10 times. At 151 I did."
2,MrP,"The author takes the bibles account as his starting and ending point with not even a nod to reason or fact. If you want a fresh look this is not it. He gives the catholic view of history but in a well polished awkward and stilted way. The book is not scholarly or interesting. I feel cheated since I was hoping for a history not another ""yes it is divine"" to the catholics interpretation of the bible. Not well written or insightful. A religious recitation but not a history book. ""George Bush"" gave him a metal for his endorsement of family values. Think he was in a fromt seat for the Tea Party."
1,entertaining but unreliable,"I managed to read less than a half and all the way I had very strong sensation the author is not really familiar with the subject, he is making mistakes very characteristic for non-professional, amateur attitude. As if he doesn't really care about adhering to the reliable sources because he's got some really interesting and important tale to tell."
4,History of the Jews,The book does explain the history in a very clear and understandable manner. We had both read Paul Johnson's article in the Saturday Mail some years ago and eventually I got around to buying the book.
4,"Excellent book, chapters needed to be subdivided.","I don't know that one could write a comprehensive book on one topic, but this comes very close. Although at times plodding Johnson covers Jewish history from beginning to current. I learned a ton about the Jewish faith and people and I felt that I was getting a balanced fair discussion without propaganda. Other than the at times plodding narrative the only other problem with this book is that the chapters go for 100 pages without any subdividing. Johnson needed to break these long chapters down to make them easier to digest, and to make it easier to stop reading and rest. It was very easy to get lost in the chapter that is why it needed some subdividing of topics. Anyway, the book is wonderful and a must read!"
5,Moving Work of History.,"A truly well written, readable historical work. Johnson is a phenomonal story teller, with a gift of great research skills. Reading this book will truly enrich any true lover of well written history. This is not a book about religion, or about a certain people, this is a book about eternal truth."
1,"Probably the worse book on... not Info Brokerage, for sure!","""Start Your Own Information Broker Service"" is not only a gross misnomer but also reassured me about the necessity of being provided a proper table of contents or a good synopsis on the ""At a glance"" page. This is a perfect example of how just browsing through its TOC should have been more than sufficient to steer you away from it. Don't waste your money on this one. If you want a good book on information brokerage, look somewhere else. If you want a mediocre general book on how to start your own business, save your money a buy a good one! It simply amazes me how this one could manage to get published by Prentice Hall..."
1,It contained two pages specific to information brokerage,"This book was grossly lacking in information pertaining to information brokerage. The book was about how to start any business,only 2 pages were dedicated to info service. Save your money! I learned nothing! I recommend the Information Broker Handbook by Rugge! It's excellent!"
1,The Book Title Should be HT Start Your Own Small Business,The book had all the basic general information on How To start your own (any type of) small business. The inside contents of the book even specifically state that the book was based on people's experiences in the mail order business. I bought the Book because I wanted specific information on starting my own Information Broker Service. The outside back cover had more information regarding the Information Broker Business than the entire inside contents of the book.
3,Seems to help limit lawn fungus,My front lawn is prone to lawn fungus. I don't want to use Spectra cause ofmy pets. When the browning or 'dollar spots appear I use this. Seems to hinderthe growth .
4,Take time for tea,"Can an author review her own book?I had so much fun discovering Ontario, and all the amazing tea rooms there are to enjoy tea, the best scones, the most mouthwatering butter tarts, and the most delicious bread pudding!Ontario is a huge province. Anywhere you go, there is sure to be a tea room - the smaller the village, the more chances there is to be a wonderful little tea room! Each tea room is unique and you can have a great time finding them all.Watch for the updated version coming out soon!"
1,Chemistry the HARD way,"If you are looking for a good introductory chemistry book, don't get this one. It will save you time, money, and effort if you get something else like Chemistry: A self teaching guide. The diagrams are horribly explained, the text is downright confusing, and to top it all off the author introduces random bits of information in the text just when you get frustrated. Don't get this book."
2,Chemistry the Frustrating Way!,"I recently needed to brush up on my Chemistry. (I had Chem 1 in college.) I could live with the boringness of this book, but I could NOT put up with the mistakes and poor editing. The chapter tests have questions on things that were never covered in the chapter, as well as wrong answers! That is not only incredibly frustrating, it also makes me wonder what else was wrong in what I was reading.I finally decided I had to give up on this book when I was having fits of complete rage and frustration. And let me tell you what brought me back to sanity - The Complete Idiot's Guide to Chemistry. It is a fabulous book - easy to read, easy to follow, everything is thoroughly explained, and it's funny!"
2,Chemistry the BORING way,"I bought a whole bunch of books to help me with my Chem 101 class in college, and the good news is that this book was the most complete and comprehensive of any of them.The bad news is that this book is crushingly dull, and sometimes hard to understand. While it was infinitely more comprehensive than ""Chemistry for Dummies"", it was so boring that I could barely keep my eyes open when studying with it. Perhaps that has something to do with my lack of talent for chemistry (as evidenced by my grade), but it seems to me that any good introductory chemistry book should at least be interesting enough that a relatively talentless student can keep their eyes open while reading it.I recommend this book for those who can follow boring texts or those who need something to help them with their insomnia."
3,Where was the editor?,"There is a lot to gain by reading Geertz; his knowledge and insight are wonderful. However, I don't think I have ever read anyone that uses run-on-sentences to the extent that he does. To pull the message out of his writing is like looking for the proverbial needle in the haystack. I can't imagine how an editor allowed this verbal diarrhea to go unchecked. I can't tell if he is suffering from ADD or is simply pretentious. If you can get past all that, it is well worth reading."
5,Stirb Nicht Vor Mir,"This book is not something to just throw to the side of your bed. Till's poems let you into the ""real"" Till, rather than the butcher or the flamethrower on stage. Darkness is contrasted with the light. Sadness vs. happiness, suicide -he speaks about everything dark and everything that is a flowing, beautiful manner in this world.I love Rammstein and I've loved Till since I first heard the infamous ""Du Hast"" in 1997. If you can understand a bit of slang northern German, you'll get a very real perspective of the man, not the showman. This book is worth getting for anyone who is a true fan of Till Lindemann."
1,Painfully off,"I wish I had paid attention to the other review on this page before acquiring this CD. I don't know how this CD got released, the monks on their own sound alright but the combo with Shalamut just does not work and her voice is predominant through the CD. I have no doubt the intentions were good and of the highest, but the results are not pleasing to listen to as her voice wavers and does not sound harmonious. Regretfully I have to give this CD a big thumbs down. If anyone does enjoy this CD I would really like to hear why."
1,Extremely disappointed,I love sacred music and chants but I was extremely disappointed with this CD. Unfortunately Shulamit cannot hold a note on key and this collaboration just does not work. I could barely listen to the CD the whole way through and will not be listening to it again. An expensive lesson that you can save yourself from.
4,"Not for the feint of heart, but definitely vibrates the soul","I wanted this because Buddhist chanting seems to help me power through chemotherapy treatments. I've been fortunate to experience some good ""performance 'art'"" in the presence of some Tibetan monks. I can recall their faces and spirit and humor effortlessly with this CD. The Kabbalah adds another interesting layer/twist. Pythagoras comes to mind. maybe D is the magic number. Ha! Put that in your book."
2,unpredictable,"This alarm is sleek and looks good, but is very unpredictable when used. We followed the directions closely and had lots of trouble with use. Alarm usually does not sound until significant amount of urine has wet the underwear or pull up. Sometimes alarm fails to work at all. Upon testing the alarm with water, it seems to work well, not sure why it does not work well with night time wetting."
3,Disappointing Directions,"Thankfully my husband and I live in the Adirondacks and have been somewhat familiar with the areas we have hiked. Out of 5 of the places we have hiked from the book, 3 have had wrong directions. The directions for Lyon Mountain say to go 9.3 miles Northwest when it is actually Northeast which brought us in a totally different direction. The campsite to go through at Lake Meachem to get to DeBar Mountain is wrong. The list goes on. It is a confusing book since many maps show mountains to hike, but don't tell how to get to them and some tell how to get to them but don't show them on a map. I will agree that it has given us a lot of ideas on where to hike around us that we didn't know existed. But, I wonder if the author actually hiked to these places."
2,"A Reliable Primer, But Less Successful Than Other Works","I was going to give this book 3 stars, because it's a populist agenda and is written for an audience completely unfamiliar with the topic, but the Kindle formatting of this document is unforgivable -- so 2 it gets. Because of this I considered returning the book, but decided against it because it was an adequate attempt to explain fear in the contemporary world and the physiology of humans and their ancestor's or special siblings.Is it worth the time it would take to read it? Well, it is an adequate primer. However, I would, by far, recommend Dan Gardner's 'The Science of Fear' and 'Future Babble'. Also, one should read Matt Ridley's 'The Rational Optimist', Steven Pinker's 'The Better Angels of Our Nature'...as well as the works of Ray Kurtzweil.. Each of these works are far more comprehensive and compelling.Mild Recommendation."
5,Excellent reality check,"Yea, we're all afraid of terrorism, diseases, death, and violence... but who would have guessed that the real threat to our health was the fear impulse spurred on by these nebulous and rare events? This book introduces us to the real stories behind the terrors - a welcome message in the midst of alarmist media and drug company marketing ploys. Siegel masterfully introduces us to the reality of the situation, and reminds us of the real issues that Americans face today - a message sorely missed and needed in our culture. An excellent read - and a welcome relief - for anyone living in today's culture of mass media sound bites and goverment issued terror alerts."
1,Disappointed is the best I can say about this book,"When a reader spends 8 dollars for some enjoyable romance, fantasy, paranormal thrills and great sex scenes, you feel ripped off when some of the all stars in this anthology fail to deliver the goods.I have read Kim Harrison, Lynsay Sands and Kelley Armstrong. These writers can write. Armstrong's WOMEN OF THE OTHERWORLD series is fantastic stuff. Harrison's series with Rachel Morgan as a witch starting with DEAD WITCH WALKING is great stuff. Something happened here that just went flat."
2,Half a Good Book,"Kim Harrison: 3 stars, maybe 3 1/2 because the story line was actually entertaining. But it assumed you'd read her other books, and anyone who hasn't must have felt lost.Kelley Armstrong: 4 stars, a good story with entertaining characters. It felt like it was stretched to make a word count, but a good read. The best of the bunch, I thought.The other two don't get a star, sorry. If you don't mind buying half a book for a whole book price, or if you're a Harrison or Armstrong fan and want to collect their entire body of work, this is worth picking up. Otherwise, don't bother."
3,ok for short stories,I personally only really liked one of these short stories. The others were ok but only one stood out. It is a good way to see how different writters catch your attention though.
3,And happily everafter....,"I really like the Rachel Morgan series by Kim Harrison, so I was surprised that the first story was my least favorite. I enjoyed the humor and adventure in the other stories, Kelly Armstrong's 'Chaotic' being my favorite. I will be looking up more titles by these authors in the days to come."
3,If you've been curious about Ivy...,"If you've been curious about Ivy in Kim Harrison's series then this is worth a read as it gives some insight into vampire politics, Ivy's personality and why she often behaves the way she does.I also really enjoyed Kelley Armstrong's short story with it's intriguing plotline and characters, I think she's hooked me into her fictional world.I can't say that the other two stories thrilled me much as I personally found them a little too far fetched, which is saying something considering I love the fantasy/paranormal, were/vampire genre."
3,Not bad,"I picked this up for a beach read, and overall was happy with the purchase. I thought the Kelley Armstrong story was far and away the strongest, with a couple of protagonists I wouldn't mind reading about again. The Kim Harrison wasn't bad. Not her best, but the Ivy backstory was interesting. The other two didn't do anything for me, though. They were both predictable and flat. So if you're a Armstrong or Harrison fan, it's probably worth buying."
5,Dates from Hell,"Received the book in perfect condition, just as described, love anything Kim Harrison writes, the book was very entertaining, and as always, 100% percent satisfied with the seller and Amazon.com."
2,Why can't all the stories in an anthology be good?,"I had been looking forward to the book, because I've enjoyed books by several of the authors, but only Kelley Armstrong delivered. Her novella is a solid entry to her ""Women of the Underworld"" series and every bit as good as her books - just shorter. The Kim Harrison story is a prequel to ""Dead Witch Walking"", focusing on the vampire character, but it doesn't add anything to that series or stand alone on its own merits. The other two stories come across as cookie-cutter romances with otherworldly stuff thrown in as an afterthought, with ""Dead Man Dating"" as the better of the two. Even though all of these authors have written good books, only one of them contributed a story worth reading."
2,Not Up to Par,"When I read a paranormal book, I want romance and excitement. All these stories dragged and some were downright ridiculous. I suppose if you are a fan of the writers, you might like this better than I did, but everything that makes a paranormal book great was missing from this one. I don't mind humor, in fact I like it, but I found nothing to laugh at in these tales except the way they were written and that is not at all funny. If you are looking for hot sex forget it, alpha males not there, lovable females no where in sight and a plot must have been lost in the editing."
2,Unremarkabkle read,"Kim Harrison's ""Undead in the garden of good and evil"" lacked plot, it was a 100 pages of nothing.""The Claire switch project"" was tiresome beyond belief. Lame & ludicrous.""Chaotic"" & ""Dead man dating"" barely managed to redeem this book. This book is definately NOT a must read."
2,Not Genuine Aleratec,"While the CDs LightScribed OK, they are not genuine Aleratec CDs and the labels are not quite as sharp and dark as my genuine Aleratec CDs. Nevertheless, the savings was such that I am keeping them."
5,Great disks!!!,I use these to record professionally and I must say these disks are very reliable and the labels come out very clear. You can't lose with these disks.
5,Recommended CMOS-OP text book!,Abundant of practical examples and explanation is clear and easy to understand. Practical and useful reference book.
2,Poor quality tent poles,"Purchased from KB, both the tent poles were broken before it was put together (one snapped, one split). The poles were made like a traditional pop-up tent--short pieces of plastic with metal collars, with elastic holding them all together. We replaced them with 1/2"" plastic pipe, which worked but still an expense we didn't intend to incur when purchasing the unit. Obviously, it's not going to go back in the original box for storage. Otherwise, the toy is made from a non-woven fabric with lots of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" symbols printed on it. I'm going to have to iron it to get the ""ocean"" fabric to lie flat, hope our grandson appreciates the effort."
1,Do NOT buy this product,"My son got this for Christmas from the Disney Store. Everything we have ever purchased from the Disney Story has been high quality. However, this product is total garbage. The poles don't fit into the play hut. And when I tried to make them fit, the fabric ripped. He's had it out of the box for less than an hour and already the fabric is ripped in 4 places. If your son plays rough like my son does, do NOT buy this product. Such a disappointment because he was really looking forward to playing with all his action figures in this tent. If this would let me give it no stars, I would."
2,It broke in less than a week,"We got this for our 3 year old for his birthday. It lasted for about a week before it broke, he was so sad. I would not purchase this item again."
1,"Poorly written and useless ""practical guide""","""An Engineering Approach to Optimal Control and Estimation Theory"" is the most amazing piece of rubbish I have found at that price in my life ! I wonder whether the author even knows what proofreading means. The book is so full with mistakes, typos, false or misleading statements, that I becomes unreadable. You can open it at almost any page and find a severe mistake.The author argues that the book is aimed at engineers, and not theorists. This is no excuse for so many errors.This book gives the overall impression that it has been written once and never proofread, by an author who maybe bet that his name would compensate for very poor writing.A must .. leave on the shelf."
1,Rip off,not only is this the wrong set from the wrong place it is not Woodstock either...do not waste your money on this junk.....
3,I just have one question...,"I own Woodstock Two and I only bought the cds for Mountain's incredible performances of ""Blood of the Sun"" and ""Theme For an Imaginary Western "". That performance is one of the greatest live rock performances I've ever heard! Now, here is my question: They play ""Theme"" 2 times on this disc, and neither is the one on Woodstock Two. Yet, as far as I know, they only played one performance at the Woodstock Festival (at 4:00 in the morning I believe, their set was never shown in any cut of the movie). So, did they completely redo their performance from Woodstock for the Woodstock Two soundtrack? Leslie West's guitar solos on Woodstock Two are his best ever I believe. Does anyone know the real deal?"
1,Live at Woodstock,The sound quality of this album was very poor and barely listenable. I can not help if this was a sound board mix. Would not recommend this album. You better off with Mountain Live.
3,"Good stories, so-so writing style","I've always enjoyed reading stories about children raised by animals or pioneer children raised by Native Americans. When I saw this book, I was intrigued that it had a little of both topics. As I started reading, I thought the stories themselves were good, but the writing style was hard to follow. I read a lot, and the long, run-on sentences and frequent use of the present tense was distracting. I often had to reread a sentence to piece together what the author was saying. As someone who has critiqued novels for a literary agency, I would have strongly urged the writer to use a more consistent, correct style. I am glad to have read the book for the stories, but it's not a book that I would reread."
2,Did the author get tired?,"Because there is no real ending to this book. I'm a Children's Librarian, and I ran across this while looking for books about stealing for a patron. The book starts out well enough; the big bad wolf disguises himself in order to steal whatever he pleases from stores & shops. The townspeople finally find the wolf's home (while searching for ""brave little Bernard,"" a young boy the wolf takes), and see all their belongings inside. Everyone claims their things, Bernard's mother finds her son's trousers, and the wolf's clothes are packed up to be given to charity. Only the nurse doing the packing is really the wolf in disguise, and he makes off with the clothes to a new town. That's the end of the story. There's no conclusion, the wolf doesn't get punished for his bad behavior, and the reader doesn't know if little Bernard is alive or dead. Cute beginning, terrible ending. I would not choose this book for storytime, as a learning tool, or anything else."
4,All that I can say...,"""WHOOOOOOAAA!...2nd to last is FABULOUS! You could shed a great deal of light on St. Louis with your approach to the Spoken Word."""
5,Practical advice for novice AND pros,"This is a great book that fills a real need -- practical advice for anyone who aspires to be a songwriter or performer in Nashville. I work in the music industry in Nashville and am often asked for advice from songwriters new in town. I'm not necessarily qualified to give advice, so now I can recommend this book. One of the most interesting features is a chapter that suggests a week's itinerary, including where to eat lunch. Often people will come to town and not have any idea of what to do. They'll try to drop in on busy publishers, get turned away again and again and then go home thinking everyone on Music Row is unfriendly. Bond explains the right way to get your foot in the door. Again, highly recommended."
1,Still waiting!,"I don't know if I hate it or love it, as I have not yet received it, having ordered it over a month ago."
2,Zapper failure,"The rat Zapper worked fine for 6-7 rats, then was stored in a dry garage for about 6 months. At first sign of more rats, Zapper would no longer work. New batteries, thorough cleaning per instructions, and contact with the company provided no help. $50 down the drain. They suggested that the high humidity where I live might have contributed to failure. I have no control over ambient humidity in Humboldt County, so I would not recommend this product if a person lives in a high humidity area."
5,I highly reccomend this product!,I have been using 2 rat zapper Ultras and 1 regular rat zapper and they do work! We live in the country and get alot of mice and rats and big ones too (One looked like a baby possum that barely was able to fit in the trap)and the Rat Zapper Ultra seems to be the better of the 2 and I have replaced batteries 1 time in 3 months. Over 50 of these varments ZAP! and no mess and I just use 2 or 3 pieces of dog food for bait. It is so much better than LIVE spring traps since we have 2 dogs in the house so there is no worry to them and the one dog usually lets us know when a rat has been zap haha! I would have never imagined such a thing but thanks so much!Dawn ASIN rat zapper ultra
2,Works Great At First,"I live alone in the country and hate those pesky mice! I get them every two or three months in the winter and they come in a little group of two to five. I can set traps but it's so gross, so I bought the rat zapper. I was thrilled and it was killing mice right and left and was so easy to dispose of. Now, after a year it is a pain in the butt. I sent it back once because it wouldn't stop blinking and wouldn't set. The company tries to see if your at fault. Did you leave it outside? Did you abuse it? Um, no. It just stopped working. Okay, mailed it to them, they supposedly fixed it and it worked a few more times and now it blinks again. I'm trashing it, I'm telling everyone what I think of it and looking for something else to use for mice."
1,still hasn't worked for me,if i could give this product zero stars i would. i purchased my rat zapper in june and it is now august. for some reason my negative review did not get posted on the sales page. hmmm. i still have not trapped any rats but there are plenty of them around. i have followed all instructions but still no rats. big disappointment for 56 dollars.
1,Our Rat feeder by Lee,"We had high hopes after reading so many positive stories. Our rats are a LOT smarter than yours, it seems. Instead of being electrocuted, they are using the device as a feeder. Not only that, they transport the kitty-food treat bait that I use about 20 feet away and store the little bits on a Tomcat glue board that I put out to catch them. I just pulled it out from where I had put it and found the thing brim-full of kitty treats. The feeder was empty. I am not making this up."
1,totally worthless,"i have a HUGE rat problem. dont want to use poison as they die in the walls and smell awful for a long time, also have large dog that could eat it if found dead in yard. cannot use spring traps as hands are weak. not successful with glue traps as they steal bait and usually get away. i thought the zapper was the answer so i ordered 2. HAVENT CAUGHT ONE AND I CAN HEAR THEM ,WOULD LOVE TO GET MY MONEY BACK USELESS"
4,Agri Zap RZU001 Rat Zapper Ultra,"This rat zapper works good by killing small or larger mice and rats. Only thing is that you cannot depend on the blinking light to let you know if there is a kill in it or not. First kill i got, no light was blinking. Then one night i go to check it and the light was blinking but nothing inside. So it's best to pick it up and look inside, that way you know for sure if you got a kill or not."
2,Maybe rats too smart?,"We had very high hopes for this product but alas, either my rodents are too smart for this thing or it just doesn't work. We have managed to kill one rat but even then, the unit allowed the critter to turn around and face outward. One would think that once zapped, it would not have been able to turn around. I am finding that the bait placed in the middle of the unit does disappear without catching anything, so now the bait is placed all the way to the back of the unit. I remain hopeful that I don't have to send this second one back."
2,disappointed,"I bought this rat zapper in November, started using it around February. It worked well for a couple of months, through several battery changes. Our barn mouse problem seems to be seasonal and I recently pulled it out again. But, replacing batteries did not do the trick, there's no connection to the charge. I looked up my purchase on amazon and realized that I only had three months to return it. Seems like something that cost $50+ should have a longer lifespan. Back to the old fashioned trap now."
2,Rat Zapper Ultra ?,So far NOTHING....3 weeks and LOTS of RATS running around in barn....will see if they get use to it and take the bait... 3 more weeks and I am returning it. Hope it works.
5,The Better Mousetrap,"The d--n thing really works, to my somewhat surprise. It works great, in fact, and caught and killed a large rat and little mice, so it works with all sizes. My mice and rats like bread so that is my bait of choice. Just a little chunk. I also feel less guilty than with the horrible glue traps that leave the little mice squeaking at you. Very quick and clean, it appears."
2,O. Well...,"Bought this in mid November. Set with toasted pita chips because it appeared the mouse was interested in toaster crumbs. Eventually we put peanut butter on the pita chip. All in all we tried peanuts, sunflower seed, squash seed, ricotta salata cheese. Perhaps our mouse was smarter than most. The trap was set with fresh batteries, its lights indicated it was working. The mouse wouldn't go way back into it apparently, although it did manage to get some of the goodies offered, even set off the blinking you-have-a-kill-light. We were disappointed in that, however. Finally my husband crammed some cheese into a common Victor trap so getting the cheese off it would require work and ""mickey"", who'd managed to carefully pick the cheese off these before, got careless. Does the Rat Zapper work? Well not for me so far."
5,Awesome! Worked the first night I set it out!,"I had a field mouse sneak into my house a couple of months ago through a torn screen (from my kids pushing on it to pet the dog). I caught him twice with a bowl, but he got away and we lost him under my couch. I tried everything-a catch and release trap, two glue traps, traditional mouse traps, and a folding fly paper trap. None of them worked. But the very first night I set the Rat Zapper Ultra out, I had a dead mouse the next morning. It's kind of expensive, but well worth it considering I spent almost as much trying all of the other methods first. Save yourself some time, frustration and money and try this first."
4,Great Product....very effective,This is great product. Killed 15 mice so far. And one of them was smart enough to not entering with the pebble food. But could not resist pizza.The only reason I did not put 5 stars was it's size ... but it works great regardless.
2,I think the batteries don't work for more than 1 rat,"When I purchased this device I sat it outside with dog food inside. After a few days I did catch a rat. Unfortunately after that, the rats simply went inside, ate the food, and left. I tried changing the batteries (4 D batteries) and caught another rat. Now, again, the rats simply go inside and have a feast. I think that with the cost of batteries, there must be a cheaper way!"
1,An Excellent rat training tool!,"This device is absolutely worthless. I purchased two of these to deal with the rats around my house. In the past month, these devices have been activated twice by rats. Both times the trap had been moved by the rat, the light was blinking, and no rat was inside. Clearly it shocks the rat, but doesn't kill it. It basically trains the rats to avoid traps!"
1,Does not work!!!!,"I did not catch anything. I used dog food, cat food, peanut butter. Nothing happened. Ended up using much cheaper regular traps to catch the mice. I wasted my money on this expensive mice trap that did not catch anything."
5,The literature claims within 24-48 hrs,"that you will catch your first mouse. We've had a mouse that we've been unable to kill for months. ""Mousey,"" as we imaginatively nicknamed him, was all but responding to voice commands and would disappear for weeks on end when we got serious about mouseproofing our house. Finally, after his crossing over glue traps of all shapes and sizes, his eating mouse poison (to no effect) and his refusal to go into the dcon trap (despite our pleading), I broke down and got a rat zapper. 4 hours after its arrival, the rapper signaled mousey's demise; he was in the trap, on his back. Its a little quieter in the apt now without mousey, but we think its for the better."
1,Works great (when you can get it to work),"I originally wrote a great review for this product, but after buying three of these Zappers and having all three break within a year, I will not be buying them anymore. As far as I can tell, they work great, but are somewhat poorly made, using very delicate parts not suited for their purpose. My latest one simply died one day. I actually watched a rat walk into it, take the dog food, and leave, so it obviously wasn't carrying a charge. After two weeks, the power light wouldn't even cut on, even with fresh batteries."
1,When it didn't work - they gave a run around,"I bought this product after reading reviews and looking for humane rat traps to kill Florida rats. Since it was not working (after clearly following the directions for baiting) the distibutor requests you call and work with them prior to returning. We spoke over the phone and email (twice) as they continued to offer me guidance for new ways to attract the rats (different food, add an orange peel, etc.) They even mailed seed to try an attract a rat to get zapped. The problem was they continued to help but it became more of a distraction and they did not return the item. I got tired of them ""helping"" & just tossed it out ($50 loss). It may work for mice - doesn't touch the rats."
2,"Works, but not of electronics not of durable quality","When it is new and has fresh batteries it works. Was $38 now $47 - no reason for that price hike. It stopped working after 3 weeks.I took it apart, and the electronic 'guts' is about the size of acigarette packet. Made in a Chinese sweat shop, hand soldered SMT parts, heaps of dodgey looking dry and dull /cold joints on a dirty, flux spattered, unsealed circuit board, and the PIR sensor had a smear on it. IC chip markings sanded off - the only thing done competently. Cleaned /re-soldered things, added sealer where needed, up and it worked again - better than new. There are vents under the circuit board, so if you live in a seaside, probably will let salt gum up the works and attack things. While electronic payload quality is low, this explains the hot and cold reviews. If it fails - send it back - they must know they have some bad batches out there."
1,Classic problem,"Purchased this from Amazon end of July. Product arrived with instructions ""Not to return to the source that you purchased it from, but to us"" which was a third party. The devise worked for about 3 weeks, than continously missignaled. I cleaned, replaced batteries etc..no change. Contacted primary vendor ""sorry, their not making these anymore, you need to go back to Amazon: Guess what, Amazon, sorry, its past the return date. What a mess. Do not purchase this product.the manufacture has discontinued it..much hunch is because of complaints and warranty issues. Buyer beware.update:Amazon came through again, notifying me that they will grant a full refund. I shouldnt have doubted them as they always seem to come through. However, the Rat Zapper should be avoided. They are no longer manufacturing it, and customer service is at best bad and at worst seemingly taking advantage of people. So, go Amazon, beware Rat Zapper Ultra, buy at your own risk."
4,Caught two.,"If the instructions are followed, the Rat Zapper will do its job. It must be kept dry,and if there is a heavy rain, a Ziplock bag is not enough."
1,Rats love stealing the bait without being shocked,"I only caught one rat during the first week of set up. After that one rat, the device is useless. Every night rats come to finish up peanut butter without being caught. It might work if I switch to new batteries. But then it becomes an expensive game. The worst is that you cannot return it since it has been contaminated. So I spend more than $50 for one rat. After being frustrated, I went to Lowes and bought twoMotomco Tomcat Rat Snap Trap 33525. I got two rats during the first night. The best thing is that they barely touched peanut butter. I don't even have to refill the bait. This Zapper thing is an Ultra waste of money."
3,Mice be gone,"We bought this product on the recommendation of several people.........we unfortunately did not have the luck they did. To date we have not caught a single mouse, we tried dog food and bird food without success."
1,The device is defected. I'm exchanging it,It doesn't work. The device never turned on. I'm exchanging it so see if the replacement will work.
2,No Rats Yet.....,"I have had the Ultra Rat Zapper two weeks now with no result. My dogs indicate that I have a rat inhabitant in my garage and I have seen one. Have used fresh dry dog food, as reccommended for bait and have produced two mice. I was hoping for a better result."
2,Not what it was advertised to be,"I had a serious rat issue and this product was a next to last resort. Tried this for two months and put several different types of bait in it and not one catch. In the meantime, a rat got into my car and chewed up a pressure switch harness on the transmission and I had to resort to poison to get them. Got two within four days, problem solved. Rats are tougher than mice to fool into going into one of these gadgets."
5,WOW,"The Ratzapper works so well it's unbelievable. Unfortunately we have rattlesnakes that come to the front porch to catch the mice that are living on our front roof. We have no choice but to eliminate the mice in that area to keep the rattlers away from the front door. The Ratzapper is easy to use, quick, and does not poison the animals that eat the dead mice (yes birds and other animals will eat dead mice). I no longer use dog food for bait and get at least one mouse a night. Note: Use the right batteries, it really does make a difference!!!"
4,Got em !,"The product worked as advertised. What more can u ask these days. We caught 2 right away and have not seen signs of any other activity. Thanks, Zapper !"
1,Garbage,Never caught any rodents. stopped working after six months and is now in the Landfill. the old spring loaded traps are still the best.
1,Doesn't Work...Save Your Money,"I have had NOTHING but trouble with this device. I do everything by the instructions; dry food, clean plates....but no zappped rat. I have gone through 4 sets of D-Cells (16 batteries) with no results.I even have the plastic mouse with glowing eyes that monitors the trap. A TOTAL waste of money; a TOTAL piece of Chinese junk!!!"
5,Good product,"I had a problem with shrews. Over a three week period, I caught 14. Also two mice. I have not seen a shrew or mouse now for three more weeks. Works well when baited with pecan bait."
1,the ratzapper,got the rat zapper but my fruit rat was too smart to go in it! Used the bait that was included and then peanut butter and also cheese. The rat finally died from old age! Only thing I caught was a Florida palmetto bug.
5,It defenitly works!!!,"If you have a problem with rodents, this product is definetly a solution. It was not even 1 hour after getting this trap shipped to my house, we heard the wizzing sound alerting that was something inside the trap. We checked it and there it was a dead rat."
1,Not for outdoors,"I put mine under the hot tub steps, where my dogs couldn't get to it. It worked once, killing a small field mouse. Then I guess the rain got to it, because now it thinks it's got something and won't reset. A rather expensive way to kill a single mouse."
1,rats go in for dinner-eat bait-NO ZAP!,"I followed the instructions to ""A Tee"". The bait kept disappearing but no dead mice. I tried another set of new batteries with no luck. The only this that this thing zapped was 45 bucks out of my wallet. I ask my local terminex guy about these and he said that even if they worked. Once you get the smell of dead rodent, rats won't dare enter again. Better off using a classic rat trap/bait stations etc. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I might recommend it to a rat because it appears to be pretty safe for them."
1,Bad,The product came without batteries. I plugged my own. Worked only once. Then the solid green light came off. I contacted the manufacturer and now have to send it back for fixing or replacement. They could not help me over the phone. So I am disappointed...
2,I am a Fool,"I am a fool, I have a mouse in my home. I got this zapper thing and put the batteries in and some peanut butter. The green light flashed on.I sat in the dark for four hours. I had to refill the peanut butter three times because the mouse came in and ate it all.That is when I read the side of the trap, RATS!If you have mice I guess it does not work-Stuart409*hotmail"
5,Muy bueno,"me encanto este producto, en menos de 3 dias ha electrocutado mas de 7 ratas... muy efectivo..."
1,"Does not work for ""smart"" rats!",After a few days trying to catch a rat that accidentally came into the house (after using traditional traps) decided to try this. This doesn't work for rats. Save your time and $ and call a professional to come get it. After setting professional grade glue traps the rat was in less than 24 hours.
3,No catch so far...,"I can't complain about this item, it was highly recommended by a colleague. It seems to perform as advertised. We know we have had mice in our apartment, but no evidence since we got this item, and we haven't caught any either. So maybe they're just hiding, or have moved on to greener pastures. In any case, I can't fault the item since it seems a condition in my apartment.Anyway, the principles seem sound, and my colleague guarantees he's caught rodents with it, so I'll put in a good word for the item, but not from a personal experience. Sorry for not having more experience to share."
5,The Better Mousetrap We've Been Waiting For,"I have had a few of the smaller units over the years. They could not work any better. I probably killed 20 mice in the attic over a few days, and even got a couple above the bathroom fan between the 1st and 2nd floors. That was awesome. I put the unit up there, ran the rat tail light out through the opening and was able to put the fan back up. No need to leave the hole open. I also had an issue with chipmunks digging around the patio and other areas causing things to start collapsing. I probably got 30 to 40 chipmunks with this thing. Note that you DO need to keep it clean, per their instructions. If I could only figure out how to get voles with it....."
5,got them,"after a ten day hiatus in the garage when i was starting to wonder where are the mice, then caught one, two, three, three days in a row! no mess, in the garbage, used dog food. Have to try my attic with the rat tale. Did the job, caught the mice!"
1,Does Not Work,"Bought this plus the plastic housing. So far, it is yet to kill anything, despite the bait disappearing several times. It is clear that something is getting inside to get the bait, tried both cat food, and, peanut butter in a plastic bottle cap as they suggest. The bottle cap and all has gone a couple of times now. I am using it outside, under a large patio inside the extra-cost plastic housing.As per the included. instructions, I contacted the mfg rather than returning the unit. After a few days I received a reply asking me to test the unit per the emailed instructions. I did, it did what they said it should, so I replied to the email stating that. All I got was a reply that said it was normal then. No further help or directions to return. Using fresh alkaline batteries as well."
1,DID work.....but no longer,"Yes, this was great at first.....killed 3 or 4 mice the first month...but no more. Light is green; I changed the batteries..cleaned the bottom of the unit with dry cloth....mice get the goods. It is past the date to return; I will have to look into a warranty, but I am sure there isn't one. Disappointing!"
2,Not working,"Got this product about 45 days. It's seem to work 3 times out of 10....saw red light blinking,lost the bait but no roden."
5,Be patient! Works well. Move it around. Try different baits..,"Additional comment - April 3, 2012. The unit continues to function very well. Still have an unsuspecting mouse wander in every now and then. I'm sold on this device and highly recommend it.I had this unit in the garage for almost 6 months until it finally caught a mouse. I was after rats though. With the good summer weather I have been moving it around the outside of the house and have enjoyed great success. Within a ten day period it has zapped three rats and two mice. Some lessons: Keep moving it around every few days. Try different bait. Besides peanut butter on crackers I have had success with a strawberry or raspberry.I like the easy cleanup. No bloody messes like you get from spring traps."
4,It Works!,"I've tried a lot of things to get rid of flying squirrels that have been in my attic for months but nothing worked until I tried the Ultra Rat Zapper. I've now caught 4 squirrels in a week's time. At first it didn't work until I found a bait that attracted them-- turned out to be simple salted peanuts. The only slight problem was that I may have worn the batteries down-- because I hadn't checked the unit for a couple of days. There is a red blinking light that flashes when the trap has been activated-- after two days of blinking -- seems to have lessened the power of the charge (although no replace battery signal occurred). In any case, replaced the batteries and the unit worked fine again. I would recommend this item-- seems like a humane system and very easy to dispose of the catch afterwards."
2,Bust,Never did succeed with this product. Something larger (racoon?) must have tried to get the food - perhaps got shocked. I found it the next morning in pieces. I was able to put it back together so the last time I tried I put a heavy brick on top. Perhaps I don't have the right situation for it to work.
3,Don't waste your money,"I'll make this quick and easy. I bought a Rat Zapper Ultra and a Tomcat Rat Snap Trap. After 3 nights the Tomcat Snap Trap - 3 , the Rat Zapper Ultra - 0 . I returned the Rat Zapper Ultra and bought another Tomcat Snap Trap (at the local hardware store that starts will an L, sorry Amazon)and have killed 8 so far. I didn't realize that many were getting to the birdseed."
3,"Rat ""Napper"" Ultra","The first rat zapper I puchased worked very well. It wasn't an ultra and was a metal color. This one is black and is supposed to be more efficient. My husband used peanut butter as bait and watched as the rat ran by the zapper in the attic. Hopefully, they will get hungry."
3,Rats are too smart for this trap,The Zapper worked well for almost two years. It killed about eight rats. The rats in my area have figured out the Zapper is something to avoid. They will eat bait placed in front of the Zapper but will not enter to eat bait in the Zapper. Rats are smart creatures. I have heard from Pest Control Advisors rats can communicate information to other rats. I am still using the Zapper in hopes it will occasionally kill a rat. I might discontinue it for a while then return to using it to see if the rats have forgotten it is something to avoid. In the mean time I am using anti-coagulant type bait blocks. As it has been true in all my years of pest control work you cannot use the same method of pest control too long at a time. You need to rotate through different types of methods to stay a head of the pests.
1,NO rat yet after two weeks!,"I examined all the reviews, and decided to buy the Rat Zapper Ultra becauseit had the best reviews of all. However it did not produce any results for me. I know the rats are there in the basement and they ate the food near buy from another product I bought recently that also did not work. However for some reason they are affraid to go inside the chamber of the rat zapper ultra. I put the food it came with and also added some peanut butter later.No results after a couple of weeks of use. They won't go in. Maybe they are smarter than the gizmo suggested? I don't know but I am upset I spent the money for nothing. So please be aware."
5,Rat Zapper Ultra and remote accessory for rat/mice control,"I've noticed some folks have problems with rats/mice eating their stored dog/cat/fish food.My advise is to buy a full-sized galvanized metal trashcan or two and place the food in there. I use cansto store my birdseed. Worked fine for 10 years. Incidentally, I just order the Rat Zapper Ultrawith remote. Sounds good! Fu's methodology of using peanut butter and gloves (cheap surgical gloves)to mask your scent is a good idea. As a scientist, I agree with his logic.I've used rat poison that come in bags in the past. The rats/mice, after eating are supposed to getthirsty and then go outside for water and kick-off out there. Sounds good but a few don't make itoutside and you can't find the dead bodies in the attic insulation. I used the same approach as anotherauthor who stated ""the smell will go away"" in a couple of days or a week (decomposition rate - sooner in the summer heat, slower in winter). My wife, also, did not like thatapproach."
3,batteries run out very fast.,"I have found using the rat zapper that the batteries get used up very fast, a few weeks at best, even without any catches. The D batteries that it uses end up costing quite a sum after a few months.If you need it for mice, there are much smaller devices that do the same job using a lot less electric and take up much less space."
5,everything it promised,"put batteries in and placed in pantry, nothing for 4 or 5 days, then saw red light blinking! wow! 3 mice in a week all on same batteries. very satisfied!!!"
1,Rats are getting fat,"A good rat feeding station. Never caught one rat. Kept clean as instructions state. Dog food disappears, no results. Nice fresh batteries per instructions.Keep away!"
3,This really (used to) work,"So far this rat zapper is working well. Two large dead rats in three nights, without any mess.I do not enjoy killing animals, even rats, but they are eating holes in my walls and living in my attic.This zapper kills them very quickly. Seeds for the bird feeder work best to attract the rats.The zapper also killed a mouse, which later disappeared from the trap.After killing two rats, the zapper stopped working. The light still turns green for a few seconds when the unit is turned on, indicating everything is working correctly.However the seed is gone in the morning but no dead rat.I called the company this morning and left a voice message as there were no other options on their voice mail system."
5,Works every time - AMAZING!,"Just got it 4 days ago. In 4 days - 4 mice/rats!! Almost like clockwork. I have to say, when you look at em after they get it, they really look like the picture on the case, arms splayed out, teeth bared, and dead. No fuss, no bleeding , just dead."
3,"Hi Yo Silver, not black","This review is for both generations of Rat Zappers. The older, silver-colored ones apparently had a motion sensor method, and those have worked and still work. I just got a mouse today. NONE of the newer, black-colored ones have stayed working. Those purport to have an improved, haha, infra red detector. They certainly do not work in an unheated area. They blink low battery with fully charged batteries. My brother reports problems with the factory, like wanting a purchase receipt. Do you keep all your receipts for mouse traps? Has the company abandoned their product? By now, they must know they have a problem with the black-colored version."
2,Too much trouble,"Hard to get it to work right. Too much food will trigger the trap, batteries will not last long even if it does not trigger. You MUST check it every day; if it makes a kill and the pest stays too long it will soil the trap and not be usable unless you completely take it apart and clean it. I found rubbing alcohol to work the best. If a rat decomposes in the trap it is a gross mess which will trigger it to show a kill.This trap might have a place for most but I bought two, one of which I ruined trying to clean it up after a kill. Way too much trouble for the cost.This is NOT a better mouse trap!"
2,No critters yet!,"Although this came highly recommended to us, after 3 weeks we still have no mice, rats, chipmunks, etc. You cannot place it outdoors if it rains -- could be the problem because it's rained almost daily and exposure time is limited. We're still holding out hope!"
4,Got my first rat today,"This rat has been in my walls for months, I watched her last night as she started emerging from a new hole she was chewing. I could see the rat leering through the hole at me. I originally had the Zapper up high near the rafters for weeks with no success.. I moved it on the ground two nights ago with dog food and peanut butter as bait. Success!UPDATE: Got another rat yesterday! (so that is a total of two rats) I am going to take one star off because the product is not perfect, therefore it does not deserve 5 stars. The design of this trap can be improved. First you should be able to open up the other side of the trap for easier cleaning and bait placement. It would also be nice if it had a tray to hold your bait."
3,Overdesigned? Rat Zapper,"My neutral review reflects the fact that I don't know yet. I am replacing a 10-12 year old Rat Zapper which, despite cleaning, no longer has a dependable fatal charge. No complaints. It has dispatched several dozen rats. But the new Zapper is still a virgin. I am wondering if the closed end is too sleekly designed with very small slits instead of the open end blocked by hardware cloth in the old model. Are the rats less willing to enter? The only action has been a false alarm. The red signal was flashing but the trap was empty What tripped the signal?I'll keep trying and I am sure I will find out eventually. But I think I should have gotten at least one after 2-3 weeks."
2,mice are saying Thank You for the food,"disappointing, and going back to the trusty but nasty spring traps. Mousies think I'm just being nice, making a larder for them that they happily and safely empty each night. Despite the light blinking red to show that it was visited, so far the Zapper has only killed a vole that made the mistake of visiting."
1,"RATS LOVE""EM!","I tried this ""GIMMICK"" for three weeks. Installed NEW Duracell coppertop batteries and baited the trap. Over the three week period, 4 rats and 8 mice ran in, got shocked, and ran OUT! It only killed ONE (1) mouse in three weeks!I changed the batteries, and the same thing happened! Save your $$$$. Don't waist it on this gimmick!"
1,Rat likes the free food,"I may have a super rat as each time the red light indicator is blinking, the bait is gone and so is the rat. He/she isn't even frightened enough of it to skip a return visit. I've gone back to peanut butter on a good, old fashion rat trap. It snaps, the rat is dead."
1,Waste of money,Rats won't go near this thing. We've had it in continual use for five months (occasionally replacing the batteries) and haven't caught a rat. We've tried a variety of baits and followed the manufacturer's sections for where and how to place the Zapper. We've caught rats now and then in snap traps and in a Hav-a-heart trap but never in the zapper. Rats won't even touch the bait we leave scattered outside the zapper in an attempt to lure them in. Don't waste your money.
3,Rat Zapper,It works but does not always turn on after catching a mouse. I have to let it sit and then the green light will come on again. I would also like to be able to use rechargeable batteries.I have only caught mice but the neighbor borrowed it and caught a rat and is planning to buy one.
2,It's not water proof,"I only had 3 kills (rat), the unit was placed out doors,however water got to it from the rain, and it has not workedsince then. In the mean time more rats are having a field-dayin my neighbor-hood using my backyard as an highway. I only wish theunit was waterproofed."
3,Watch out for humid days.,Worked fine until the humidity got high and apparently caused condensation on the metal panel which in turn activated the trap. I would not recommend it being used anywhere but a climate controlled area.
1,CAUTION-FIRE HAZARD,"Who knew these could cause a fire? I sure didn't.The funny thing is we are still without power after Sandy and the thing that woke my husband up was wondering why we had ""lights"" in the kitchen.The Rat Zapper had a meltdown and started a fire.We did have an older model purchased in 2010, but reviews are no longer accepted for that particular purchase."
1,"Not 1 mice, or rat!!!","Has not gotten 1 mice, or rat.; do not use your money for this item,; am very disappointed in item."
3,Rat Zapper Ultra hasn't worked for us,"I'm revising my original review, so this is really Part 2. Part 1 stated the product simply did not work for us, and that was accurate for about the 1st 7 - 10 days. No ""red"" flashing warning light, no captured/killed rodents, after many different baits and locations. However, in the last 48 hours the Rat Zapper has killed 2 rats in our garage, and a 3rd time I found the red light flashing, the bait gone and no sign of the rodent. . .so no kill in this instance, but I doubt it's having a great weekend. In any event. . .fair is fair. this product is working now and deserves a better review from me. . ."
5,Might seem a bit pricey but amazing so far,"Have been using this for about a week now and must say i am impressed. Apparently a family of rats had taken over residence in my house and have gotten rid of 4 so far in the past 7 days. I was a bit apprehensive about spending so much on a mouse trap, but this thing is definitely worth it and recommended."
2,Poor performer,"I questioned whether the Rat Zapper Ultra would work properly. It sounded complicated, and I intended to use it outdoors to trap voles. So, I bought it online from the orange big box store to make a return easy. I placed it in the associated Rat's Nest box. I killed one vole. Then, I got the error light indicating the trap needed new batteries. I replaced the batteries, but I still got the error light. I cleaned the trap, but I still got the error light. I returned the trap to the orange big box store."
5,This one's a keeper!,"Have this for about a year now. It has killed many a rat. Where I am the rats can grow big enough to still have their hind legs sticking out of this trap, and their heads on the sensor plate. For those you have to change out the D-Cell batteries every three months, as the instructions say, or they'll leave with the bait; because rats can sit on their buttocks and reach for the bait (very light contact with the electric plate/sensor)."
2,Agri Zap,"""IT AIN'T NEVER CAUGHT A RAT (OR MOUSE) AND IT AIN'T NO FRIEND OF MINE.I WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT SUMMER TO REVIEW MY RATING."
3,It must be deadly.,"It must be deadly because I have had it in five different locations without a single mouse being killed.Word is out, don't go near this free food store."
5,Works wonderful!!!!,"Pack rats can be hard to catch in any kind of trap but my neighbor lent me theirs, just like this one, and it worked so well--I caught 3 in 4 days!--that I had to get my own. No mess, you don't have to worry about catching the dog or the cat so you don't have to hide them in corners to make sure all other critters stay out. I definitly recommend this product."
1,Did not kill anything,I bought the rat zapper a couple months back because some rats got into my basement an made themselves at home. Months later they are still living there and the rat zapper has not killed a single one. I baited it with peanut butter like others and after a week nothing so I thought to myself maybe the rats are to smart to go in. I decided to try a more attractive bait so I put a small piece of colby jack cheese in the back and a tiny piece of chicken. I figured the rat could not resist. About a month later still no flashing lights and I pick up the zapper and the cheese and chicken are gone. I turned the zapper off and on again to see if the battery had died and the light turned green indicating that the battery was still good. I dont know about others that bought this but either this dont work or mines is defective.
3,Works some of the time,Zaps the rat only half the time. I've seen rats crawl in and out of this thing a few times and nothing happens. I've followed all the reccomendations I've seen on line (cleaning..ect...) and still only catches the rat about half the time.
5,Non-poisonous Perfection,It works. It works. It works!!! No poisons. No rats crawling off to die in the wall somewhere. No messy squashed rat heads to release from a sprung trap. They just go inside. They die. The light blinks. You empty the trap. Simple. Easy. What can I say??? I purchased this for my daughter who had rats in her attic. She caught three in less than a week (two on the same day).
5,NO MORE RATS!!!!,"Had chickens for a while - they attract rats. I ended up with a ""famiy"" of over 30 rats take over and destroy everything they could get to. The Zapper took them out in less than 2 mths. Now I've installed in the house and caught a mouse within 2 days."
2,Not For Outside Use!,"This would maybe be 3 stars if it worked outdoors, but I would not chance it! It has a very cheap build for the cost and has the electric switch and electronics on top, exposed to weather, so I would not want to use it outdoors (as I had intended). I bought a simple Haveaheart trap and sent this back. If you intend it for indoors, it would work probably fine, but it still looks cheap for the price. I just was unimpressed."
5,Works great!,"It looks harmless, and apparently mice think so too! It regularly catches rodents. It's also easy to clean. What more could you want? Way better than spring or glue traps both in effectiveness and in humanely killing the critters."
1,The greatest piece of crap ever!,"I ordered the rat Zapper Ultra and the Rat tale, well I used brand new Duracell batteries (4D batteries) and the light never came green, still always blinking red, this thing NEVER worked so needless to say was never USED, I have never wasted my money in a worthless piece of merchandise like this and never will either.I called the company to complain about three times, a ladiy name Suzie always answers and says well I'll have somebody from our other company call you, and never have I heard from any of them.I called my visa and requested a refund and will report them to the Better Business Bureau also.Companies like this who take people's money and their merchandise doesn't even work the first day are thiefs and should not be in business. Amazon should deal with them too and not sell their wares for other people to have this problems either!Agri Zap RZU001 Rat Zapper Ultra"
2,Batteries.,A dozen down over the past 3 months and still counting.All sizes from small rat to a huge Rock Squirrel which is just a rat with a hairy tail not like a bushy tree squirrel.I use a little wild bird seed. That's all it takes.
2,LIMITED LIFESPAN,"WHEN THIS PRODUCT WORKS, ITS GREAT. IT HAS A LIMITED LIFE, THEN YOU HAVE A $50.00PIECE OF JUNK. I HAVE TWO $ 50.00 PIECES OF JUNK NOW. IT BARELY MAKES THE YEAR.GREAT CONCEPT, BAD EXECUTION."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Product does not work. Tried different bait foods, locations and still ""ZERO"" caught. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT."
1,Fail!!!,"Had this set up for three days now. I checked it this morning and found the red light blinking signifying a dead rat, found the bait gone and no rat. will try one more time before I return it to amazon. 2nd attempt failed as well. Contacted the manufacturer as it stated in the manual to do so before returning; I called and the man I spoke with told me he would have some one who knows about the product call me back, a week later still no phone call. I am sending this thing back for a refund, terrible product and manufacturer has terrible customer service"
2,Didn't catch the rat,"We meticulously followed the directions and gave the trap 3 weeks to work. We then bought a live cage trap for considerably less. The disposal is not fun, but no more rat within a couple of days. I'll be trying out the rat zapper on mice and see if it does any better.The idea behind the rat zapper is great, but I'd like to see it work."
5,Rat Zapper,"I sent this trap to my son who lives on Maui, HI. He is very pleased with the performance of this trap. Rodents are a huge problem upcountry in Haiku where he lives. He likes that he can dump the dead rat into a plastic bag then into the trash with such ease. Since last week he has caught 5 of the little $#@%^ already. :)Jeanette Gibson"
5,Amazing mouse trap,"Within 30 seconds of setting this thing up i caught a mouse. Within two weeks, we stopped hearing, seeing, and finding droppings from mice in our city house. That's amazing."
4,It WORKS - Unlike Other Traps,"We have tried every mouse trap known to man (I'm serious), and nothing works like the Rat Zapper Ultra. Recommended to us by a family member with chipmunk issues, we decided it could work for our country mice and the chipmunks who like to come in our garage. Within the first several days, we had caught at least 12 mice. We continue to catch a couple a week (our garage is far from rodent-tight). We simply use leftover chicken feed or bird seed and it does the trick.I love how the animal doesn't suffer - the death is instant. The red light lets me know when to empty the trap, easy peasy. I only subtracted one star because the battery life isn't awesome - but that's what I expected with something that zaps rodents. It needs to be mobile, will not always be near an outlet, and it does its job. Worth the batteries.If you are tired of finding your mouse traps cleaned of food and yet still mouseless, give this a try."
1,Failed after 1 year,"This trap was very expensive compared to other types of traps. However, it sounded worth the money, so I bought one. After a year it stopped working. I cleaned it as described by the manufacturer, but it still wouldn't work.I called up the company, and they said, ""Sorry, the warranty doesn't cover after a year.""Basically, this device is a scam. If you want to pay $40 for one year of mouse-catching, go ahead . . . but I'll never buy one again!"
3,"better than regular traps, but pricey and slow going","I have a major rat and mouse problem, so I feel like I need 10 of these. It is a pricey gizmo, but it does work and is certainly a lot neater and more humane than regular messy traps. I have not caught a rat yet, but I certainly have caught some mice. Rats are very smart and I did not get the outside add-on cover (which costs more) which would have been better for tackling my rat problem. There is also a special technique for catching rats, you have to get them used to the zapper for several days before you turn it on, so you can get them comfortable with going in there. So I am just catching mice right now, but not at the rate I had hoped.I do wish this existed in an electric version. Batteries are expensive and bad for the environment. You can not use rechargeable batteries in these units.I think if you just have an occasional mouse or rat, this could be a good solution."
1,Hasn't worked yet,"I've been using the Rap Zapper Ultra for weeks now with no results. From what I've read, it must work much better on mice than rats. Rats are too smart. I've tried to outsmart them using various foods. They ate the dog food that I put in the front of the zapper, but have never gone all the way in where they will get zapped. I'm very disappointed, but I'm going to keep trying. The rats would rather eat all the oranges off my trees than all the yummy things I've been putting in the zapper."
3,Works well when it Works,"I couldn't catch any of the myriad mice and, maybe, rats paradingthrough my house. But the excellent customer support gaveme good tips over the phone and it's now working 75% of the time.Mice are a lot more clever than we give them credit for. You needto keep moving the zapper around and using different baits. Justdiscovered that raisins work well."
5,works great ....and clean,"well i NEVER bought a rat trap in my life, but our apartments got rats from a lady leaving trash out.got 3 of these, 8 snaps and poison ....all worked, but these electrics had the best kill rate on big ones....the big ones never did hit the snap traps, but the electrics and poison got them.also used inside one unit when one ran in in the middle of the night when a tenant opened her door at 4am to toss trash out.dead in the trap the next morning.good traps. now using them in my barn for mice."
1,Multiple Defective Units,"Rat Zapper must be having serious issues with their units. They will constantly put you on hold, and do not return phone calls. I am on my second (2nd) unit that stopped working after catching one mouse and one chipmunk. I followed their cleaning instructions, and replaced the batteries. The unit did not get wet either. I can only imagine that something is wrong with the design."
1,No Zap!,"Followed the directions for the set up and operation of the unit and all appeared to be functioning properly. I observed the targeted rodents enter and leave on several occasions and the bait food was consumed. The trip light was set off but no catch. I changed the batteries to another new set and no lights activated on test, catch, or any other mode. Returned it to Amazon and it was replaced promptly and courteously. The second unit indicates it is working when the on switch is activated but so far rodents are still taking the bait and not being caught. All directions are being followed. This has turned into an expensive rat poison holder and will be returned. I have owned the standard rat zapper with an upgrade battery pack and it worked very well. This Ultra model does not function as advertised."
3,"Works, but only for about a year","This works well, but it gave out after about a year and 10 kills. Mice could take bait even with fresh batteries."
5,CLEAR!,"Not only does this product work, but the support is great too. We have had great success with this unit. This week alone we have zapped 7 mice. This is the time they start to look for winter homes. The best bait is some peanut butter between 2 pieces of crunchy dog food (included). They can't resist the PB! At the start of the season, the device activated several times, and when I checked it, no mouse. One email to the company and within 24 hours they sent a solution. Just place a damp cloth or napkin, as a welcome mat, in front of the Zapper. The mice walk on it, making a better contact when they go over the zap pad, then..BAM! No problems since that solution was suggested. Batteries last a long time, good product and good service. I also recommend the plug in mouse that has flashing ears when the trap is activated. I can have the Zapper in our crawl space and the plug in mouse out in the hall. I'll be buying another unit for my garage."
3,"""Something Wicked"" decent, but can't compare","This was the first Iced Earth album I had ever bought, (back in '99) And I must admit it is a good, strong album. The only problem is it becomes overplayed rather quickly (about three months time). I feel that the strongest track on the album is the final track (more of an epic), ""The Coming Curse"". It stays with the time honored Iced Earth tradition of the final track on an album being a seven-miniute plus epic. Truly the greatest triumph of the album, (defeats blessed are you for #1 spot). One thing I have noticed however is that a lot of the songs on the album seemed to be somewhat ""borrowed"" from earlier Iced Earth albums. The second and third tracks sound ALMOST EXACTLY like the second and third tracks from their 1997 release, ""The Dark Saga"". If you are a die hard Iced-devil or just new to Iced Earth, this makes a great addition to your collection of CDs. I would also reccomend it to the not-as-die hard fans out there, but only for a cheaper price."
2,Not that great,"Gotta let you guys know, this album is a dissapointment. Stand Alone completely rips off Metallica's Blackened. 10 mediocre tracks, not very memorable. I'd skip this one."
4,Good stuff,"I like the darkness of the album as a whole. The ending trilogy is a great heavy listen. The whole Anti-Christ thing is very creepy, excellent guitar riffs fill the track with haunting rhythms.The second track ""Holy Martyr"" is actually a very sad song, filled with despair and hopelessness, but the music makes up for it.A great CD for headbanging."
5,Dag,"Iced Earth is an incredible band. They are practically the only American power metal band in the market. They are cool, profound and talented. Matthew Barlow, can sing really great. I might like him better than Ripper. Nonetheless, it's my opinion as of this moment. If you don't own this album then you don't know what American power metal is. Listen to it and understand it. The lyrics are awesome and they will touch your heart.Enjoy"
5,Something wicked this way comes!,"This cd rocks. I am a big IE fan and this was the first cd i bought by them. It is a perfect mix of heavy metal riffs and melodic lyrics. The cd jumps around a bit from heavy songs like stand alone to songs like melencholy, but somehow, this all fits strangley together. The combination of heavy kick drums and long loud riffs makes you feel like you are right at one of their concerts! This album should belong in any collection.The best way to describe this band, though, is Iron Maiden meets Slayer.Don't worry though,the satanic lyrics of Slayer are replaced with the type of singing you would hear on a Maiden rercod. While I am not a big fan of eighties metal, this stuff sounds friggin great!"
3,"True Metal indeed, but simplistic","While this album has many great hooks, excellent vocals, and some very good songs, I can't believe the amount of hype around Iced Earth. Songs like ""Stand Alone"" show their style off well, but I can't see how they get mentioned in the same breath as Blind Guardian, Rhapsody, and even Iron Maiden (!?) when the style of song writing is so much more simplistic and conventional (not to mention some really cheesy lyrics). I would recommend this to anyone who wants to hear good hooks, but I think it is one of those metal albums that doesn't have enough depth to intellectually occupy one's interest for an extended period of time. Blind Guardian is catchier AND smarter, but I see way more Iced Earth shirts at your average metal show."
5,10 incredible metal songs...and a trilogy!,"What could get any better than this? Jon Schaffer and Larry Tarnowski are now the masters of thrash. Great solos, although it dosen't compete with their old guitarist, Randy Shavner.(Sorry if i spelled it wrong)""Burning Times"" is a great song about the Inquisition, and the song about Christ(Melancholy) has an amazing hook. There's so much metal goodness on this. Even an instumental(Iced Earth hasen't done an instrumental since 1991)! And Matthew Barlow has to be one of the best singers of metal. A intresting cocept for the trilogy. About a prophecy saying that a thing, not a man, will destroy mankind 10,000 years from now and rewrite history. COOL! ""Watching Over Me"" is a great ballad to a friend who died in a motorcycle accident. I forgot his name, but he shall be missed. Excellent album."
3,True metal...,"Well, personally I don't think that this album is the best Iced Earth album. This album is something that many Helloween fan would call true metal. If you like power/thrash metal, this album is for you"
4,A wicked offering from these metal gods...,"This album is a true classic and probobly the best so far from iced earth. It starts of strong, and contains many of iced earths best tracks of there career. A must have for any metalhead \m/"
4,Really strong stuff,"The cover art really says it all. The emotion and fantastic imagery captures the mood and expression for the album extremely well. All of the old metal cliche'd expressions apply--the sound is definitely bone crunching (especially the opening to the third song, the energy of the guitars literally speed grinds out of the speakers).The songs remind me occasionally of Piece Of Mind era Maiden, but the style is harder, louder, mostly faster, and the singer is not your 2-step-vibrato .The only real problem I had with this CD in general was that there are 4 songs (count 'em) where the tune starts out slow, mellow and mournful, with the singer really being a bit melodramatic, for the first minute--and then the band EXPLODES INTO SOUND....just a little cheesily distracting. But if you can suspend good taste for just that little bit of time, there are plenty of great riffs, catchy choruses, and great production to wrap your ears around."
5,THIS GREAT,Okay i am writing this review because this is iced earth's best of one of their best CDS it has melody and heavyness Matt barlow voice is great the rest of the band is great too but i have to admit there are a few parts where the album suffers like on the something wicked trilogy to me only the coming curse was any good but still a GREAT BAND GREAT ALBUM a triumph for the AMerican metal scene !!!
2,Very flat,"Maybe it's just that I can't appreciate heavy metal. I love some other more melodic metal bands like Kamelot and Sonata Arctica. However, I think these guys are seriously lacking. They have fairly good intros but everything is very repetitive. As soon as the singer comes in, he kills whatever melody might have been in the song. I must ask, is it really that hard to cross metal with melody and good singing? Apparently. By all means, though, if you like static, un-melodic, this could be for you.The other really annoying thing is the constant switch-off between ballad and heavy. The singer sings half decently in the ballads (but not at all during the heavy) but the ballads are all fairly lame (they definitely would not hold up two seconds next to Kamelot's ballads). The lyrics are just painful. I listened to them for about two seconds and was kind of like, ""Is this really the best you can come up with?"""
2,WHAT?,"I like the songs...a few to many slow songs....and the singer just blows! He sounds alright sometimes and really funy other times! Can't stand the voice, I just can't stand the voice!"
1,"Yeah, right, whatever.",If you came here from one of the heavy metal pages where you saw that Iced Earth is the next greatest thing since sliced bread please allow me to be merciful and softly burst your bubble; don't save your money. Go buy Korn or something good. Don't waste money on this tripe.
5,Redkin shampoo for colored hair,This is the best shampoo and conditioner for highlighted hair. It helps maintain the color (which we all know cost!) better than any other marketed product!!
5,Wonderful!,Just great! I've used it before and it was nice to get it in bigger quantity this time for a great price.
1,yuckkkk,"I dye my dark brown hair to a supperr brightt almost magenta color and i started using this product because it sounded like it would really prevent my fading! unfortunately, this shampoo is sooooo heavyy, first of all, color still fades out! second, leaves a nasty residue on your scalp and it just keeps packing and packing on. its disgusting, if i scratch my scalp i can show you all the gunk that this shampoo has left. PLUS! it gives you horriblee pimpless on your scalp that are painful and gross. my hair does NOT feel clean whatsoever but i have a gigantic bottle that i have to finish. SAVE YOURSELF, DONT BUY THIS."
2,New formula did a number on my scalp,"I have used this shampoo/conditioner set for years with great results, until I purchased the new formula (which includes cranberry oil). For some reason this new product left my scalp itchy, oily, & caused me to break out along my hair line. With the old formula my roots would only be a tad bit oily by the 3rd day of not washing it, now on the 2nd day my roots are greasy & my hair feels dirty & looks limp. It feels like there is a heavy build-up on my scalp & hair, which is causing it to look duller & the color less vibrant. Needless to say, I will not be using this set anymore after many faithful years. The old saying definitely applies here: If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"
1,Worst shampoo/conditioner ever!!!,Cons1. Leaves nasty buildup on your scalp and hair2. Causes Dandruff3. completely washes off your hair color4. Hair becomes greasy the next day5. Clogs pores on your skin (back and chest)6. ExpensiveProsNONE
2,Great Shampoo/Conditioner with awful side effects :(,"I absolutely loved this shampoo and conditioner. Unfortunately, after about 2 months I starting developing AWFUL bumps on my scalp (like large painful zits). They were very painful and I finally went to the Dr. and stopped using this shampoo/conditioner since the dermatologist said whatever I was using was leaving a heavy residue on my scalp! After stopping the shampoo/condtioner and using a special shampoo the Dermatologist recommended (T-sal) my scalp bumps were gone thank God! I don't know what I was thinking, but after a few bad hair days I tried the shampoo/conditioner AGAIN and yes...the bumps returned! I thought maybe the first bumps I had were a 'coincidence'? Nope! They were definitely caused by this shampoo/conditioner..."
4,Armitage's Native Plants,"Good presentation of native plants, but could have more photos of some of the more obscure species. The book is slanted more toward the southeast and east U.S. Representation of western species is not as strong as it could be, but overall a very interesting book."
5,The work is inspiring.,"Remoff makes her land and special characters that live there come alive. Her bout with cancer is not depressing;she draws much from the enviornment to enjoy life and passes that verve on to me. Her attention to detail reminds me of another writer, Ann Dillard. I enjoyed the book so much that I gave it to another reader that likes places like Osprey Lake."
5,A gift which will touch your heart,"I cried when I read this story and yet, the joy in reading this wisdom will endure for generations to come. I feel so touched and want to share this gift with all who will listen. Women,can take comfort in knowing Heather has put their feelings into words. Life's legacy!"
4,A tale of courage and strength in facing terminal illness,I enjoyed reading this book and could not put it down. Ms. Remoff's details of the changes of seasons and her journey through the treatment for cancer were beautiful and moving.
5,I heart Rikku,"Rikku looks perfect, the only flaw being that the box was opened previously, but that was worth it to pay only $50 instead of $70> an unopened box would bring.The figure looked sexy as ever and is great for any FF collector."
4,A very accessible overview of what the critics have to say.,"Malcolm Page's slender volume is a very accessible work. It moves around the various criticism that 'Howards End' has received over the years. Page's survey of the criticism is handled sensibly and is a very good starting point for wider reading about the author and his novel. His own critical voice is a very balanced one and Page adopts a reasonable stance on a writer who seems to attract fairly extreme reactions. Of particular note is the short section dealing with E.M.Forster and feminism. This section illustrates Page's ability to survey the criticism and then offer an informed opinion. Overall, this volume serves as a very useful starting point for a study of the novel."
1,Who Is This?,"There are only two artists' music that I will purchase not having heard one note of the CD. Those two artists are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. ""Songs of Judy Garland"" was a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't know what ""look"" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child. Ms. Eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of ""makeover"". And the music...I tried so many times to like it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening to ""Liza Minnelli"" singing her mother's music. I did not hear Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm sorry...this doesn't."
5,"LINDA EDER,TREASURE OF A LIFETIME","SUBLIME!!! Linda Eder is the one and only voice of today. She is sheer perfection in every possible way. I have the complete DVD collection of Judy Garland. No one sings ""like"" Judy. Linda is not attempting to sound like her. This is a tribute CD. Linda does, however, sound amazingly like her at times. This CD is a must for Linda and Judy fans of all ages. Enjoy!!"
4,Eder Does Garland,"And does it well. Few other singers would even attempt this album, let alone produce such a superb interpretation of Judy Garland's classics that is Eder's own."
5,Mixture Control Solenoid,This control solenoid fit properly and worked perfectly. The kit included extra bolts and springs to replace the old worn ones.
5,No Complaints Here,Does what it is supposed to do and at a fair price. No problems using it for my PS3 logitech GT steering wheel.
4,timing,"My grief counselor suggested I read this book. It arrived on time,but it didn't seem to be for me, more for younger spouses, I am 65. But when I hit about seven months into widowhood, I picked it up again and read through it. I answered the questions and wrote in the book. Though I do not agree with the whole approach it took in some areas that might be more controversial, I can say that this book helped me through the worst months.I have recommeded this book to others."
5,Working through grief,"An exceptionl book. It has been instrumental in giving a major push forward. Something that time cannot do is help you find your way and give logic or sense to the now senseless. It forces one through the suggested questions to ask yourself, to think about the spot you are at, the events that have transpired and the spots in time you will never revisit. None of it was useless and I can say truly this was valuable reading even months later."
4,Helpful suggestions,I thought this was another good resource for me after loosing my husband at just 40 years. I do think the writter's perspectives may be influenced by the fact that they were both able to move on in a relationship with each other.
5,Excellent Help for Grief,"I am losing my husband to Cancer and this book covers it all. I read it in preparation for the loss. It has given me great insight on what's to come from a Christian perspective. If you are losing a spouse or have lost one, this book is a must to read!"
5,"Caring, Persuasive, Positive","I ordered this book without reference due to its use of both the psychologist and the theologist perspective. I have found it the most important of the many books I have received or purchased since my wife died suddenly, leaving me with two young children and a seemingly endless set of questions and emotions. The authors manage to share with you some of their experiences in losing a spouse while providing a well researched handbook for getting on a path through the darkness. It is at once an account of their own grief (I find I need to know more and more about how others dealt with the situation) and a list of practical advice and activity that move you through the shock to a constructive grieving process. No prescriptions here, but some very sound questions to be asking yourself, backed up by research and scripture. I have to thank them for going through the effort of writing this down and sharing so much of themselves as well as their beliefs and knowledge."
2,If you are a DEVOUT Christian then this is for you...If not...,"...then you need to look elsewhere. I ordered this book for my mother and eventually returned it. It piles on the religion thick and heavy. If you are a devout (read: VERY RELIGIOUS) person, this is the book for you. If you are simply spiritual or just not terribly religious, this book borders on being offensive. There are a lot of other terrifically helpful books available for newly widowed spouses that don't push the religion aspect as heavily as this one does."
4,You're Not Alone,"I found the book helpful and hurtful as I had to work through the sudden loss of my wife at 46. The book gives you two authors that have ""been there, done it"" and understand what is happening to you inside. It helps to know that it is ok to hurt and miss that spouse. The first time reading was very emotional for me and I know that In a few more months I'll pick it up again, to help with the journey of healing. The two view points are a great help. I have mentioned it to my pastor, I recommend it highly. A very informative and insightful book."
3,A Decent Intro to the World of Espionage,"This book was written by a former CIA operative who now teaches intelligence topics in the university. Along those lines, this book is written with the university student audience in mind. In other words, it is a decent intro to the world of espionage, written with an academic style. There is much of interest in the book, but at the same time some of the same examples get repeated over and over. A few of the chapters were great, and some were just so-so. Also, if you are not familiar with some of the famous spy literature such as Le Carre and Graham Greene you may find yourself a little lost on some of the examples. Overall a decent book on the topic--probably just right for a college course."
3,Interesting and shallow,"I liked the premise of the book, to contrast our view of intelligence gathering with ""real life"". Each section has something good. Too much information is repeated throughout the book. It is very American-centric, which is OK, but there are other spy organizations in the world."
3,I have two digital cameras. . . . and well here's my view,"... This camera uses memory cartrages. They can be kindaexpensive. So #1 if your going to purchase this camera make sure youspend a little more money and get the one with the microdisc. It will save you a little in the long run. #2 If your going to by this one anyway I suggest U get a USB memorycard reader. It makes downloading to your computer faster.After purchaseing this camera I was given another. It was a b-day present. This camera was the pasnasonic palmcam. I started using it and found that it uses Imation 120MB disks. Those disks cost less, per disk, than each of those memory cartrages. Also you can use the camera as the drive for those Imation superdisksAll in all I would rate this camera well but if your gonna get this camera, get the one with the microdisc. If you want to save money on memory get the Pasnasonic palmcam. thank you"
1,SHE'S PRETTY - THE BOOK IS TERRIBLE!,"Bought the book and expected one thing and got another. Very disappointed in the fact that they used a pretty face, some respected opinions and used information to create a terrible book.My first question was ""Where is her expertise?"" It's alarming knowing that anyone could put a book out and the press can hype it up and before you know it we have a female safety expert on a mission not to help but to make money.Hopefully the author will take into account how people might take her serious and if some of her advise is not proven their harm will be on her head.I loved Gavin DeBeckers work and Strong On Defense and one of the better books that recently came out is the Personal Protection Handbook by Tom Patire. All books writen by proven sources!Very diasapointed to say the least!Shirley"
3,"Good, Common Sense","The information, though brief, proves informative, e.g., five pages on self-defense aerosols like pepper sprays (how they work, foams vs. sprays, etc.) feature in the chapter on self-defense products. Other chapters are similarly broken into sections that contain tips for different realms, such as the home (draw the curtains) and work (have security escort you to your car). The advice is thoughtful and comprehensive, and while much is common sense, this book gathers it all in one place.The information that is given is basically stuff I already knew. I guess you still have to read it to make sure, because there are still people who don't know some of these things. I think it would be a great book for girls age 13-25 to read. Good gift for girls starting High School & College."
5,A Girl's Gotta Do What a Girl's Gotta Do,"BUY THIS FOR EVERY WOMAN YOU KNOW!! I have just sent a copy to my college age daughter, and am going to get more for her friends. Kathleen Baty has written a very humorous and informative book, full of interesting facts and advice. I am inspired that she has created such a positive book after enduring 20 years of staulking, Bravo! This book is what every woman needs to know, presented in an un-scary or preachy manner."
1,This is nothing we haven't heard before,"I bought this book after reading about it in People Magazine and was very disappointed. I was buying the book to hopefully learn something new about safety, and all of the information provided in the book was old news. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is seriously looking for new safety tips."

3,"Great for tourists, not gamers","I wanted to like Traitor's Gate. Really. After all, it offers a brilliant recreation of the Tower Of London, with photorealistic graphics that provide a downright eerie atmosphere. And it is great for anyone who's ever wanted to explore the parts of the tower that are normally shut off to the public (or anyone who can't fly off to London at any given time.) But as a game, it just falls flat. There's precious little character interaction (aside from the occasional guard you'll have to shoot), and the slow, prerendered 3D movement from node to node will grate on your nerves after about fifteen minutes. On the plus side, the puzzles are well integrated (but a little too tough at times), and the gameplay is nonlinear, which is a rare treat for anyone who's ever played a first person graphic adventure. I enjoyed Cyberflix's ""Titanic: Adventure Out Of Time,"" and I hoped this would offer a similar, historically accurate thrill. It had all the potentional, but just fell short."
1,Isn't the game you may think it is,"I thought games like this died out several years ago. Maybe if this were an average game letting you move around freely, it would be good, but it's not. With all the technology put into games now-a-days, this kind of game is just boring. It's like ""Myst"" or, if you've even heard of it, ""Congo"". You have to click the mouse to move. It was the same with the ""X-Files"" game, but I actually enjoyed that because you were investigating, not dodging guards and avoiding alarms. If you make one mistake, that's it, you're done. You can't run or hide, you just stand there and get captured. Save you $20.00"
2,Turned my Mouse into a Traitor,"My biggest complaint about this game is the totally abysmal mouse movement. I found myself wanting to throw it at the screen, so lousy is the navigation. This game is the winner of the worst navigation plan ever conceived. I give it the Golden Blind Mice Award, only given to games that cannot figure out how to illustrate to the player any visual clues to where they are supposed to go without a cane. Even with one, you will be ""tapping"" your mouse so frequently without any results that you might as well put on tap shoes and dance across the keyboard waiting for something to happen. The PDA console takes up too much of the screen, the inventory methods are sloppy. This is an awful game."
1,Avoid this game like the plague.,"Seriously. I bought it because I was curious how it would play.Badly is the answer. It is a first person perspective game, however Doom had better interaction than this. You basically find that the entire interface consists of clicking on the correct location on the screen. The program then switches to a quicktime movie of you moving into the new location (including opening doors, turning to one side to look for guards, etc.) and deposits you in the new location. You can then pick your next location. In fairness it uses the quicktime 3D view stuff so you can turn 360^ to find new locations to click on, but I've seen web sites selling apartments where you can do that...In summary this would be fine as a free game on a web site, but it is so un-interactive its more like working with a spreadsheet than playing a game. It might be good for someone who wanted to create a half-life/quake map of the Tower of London, but otherwise avoid it."
1,pillow to hard,this pillow is a hard as a rock. Very uncomfortable to us. I did not realize that the company has a no return policy on this product. I do not recommend this product to anyone.
2,Don't go cheap,"This pillow is okay, but it sure is nothing special. I was told I needed a cervical pillow by my doctor. That it would help with the neck pain I've been having, but this pillow really isn't better than the one I had previously been using. The pillows at the doctor's office were $60, so I thought I'd save some money buying this one. It really wasn't worth it. Cervical pillows are nice, but buy the brand your doctor recommends, if you have neck pain."
1,No sleep,"Like most have found this, the pillow contour is too hard. Granted, they wear in but this would take years. It is an okay pillow for watching TV or reading, not for sleeping."
3,Dissappointed,"This pillow started off great for me, it was real firm so I thought it would last longer than the other pillows I've tried so far. Here I am a month later returning it because it is starting to go flat and not providing the support I need anymore."
3,Price went down dramatically after purchased,"Been waiting for the price to mark down a little bit before purchasing it, took several weeks of waiting before the price went down from $89 to $67. Now that I purchased it, the price went down dramatically in an instant from $67 to $55. Nice job Amazon website! It tracks its consumers well.Don't know about rating the bluray a perfect 5, all you got are games 1-7 and press conferences as your bonus feature. Won't hurt their pocket if they could have included the Championship DVD in here as well so that you don't have to buy them separately. They were made by the same company, anyway (Bombo). I thought this is a ""COLLECTION EDITION"" as they say?"
4,The object database standard,This is a must-have book if you want to know the state-of-the-art of object database standardization efforts up to this point.
5,i love it just what i wanted,i love it just what i wanted it peels the apples quickly and perfectly i use it all the time.
1,"Good idea, poor construction...",This apple peeler would have probably done a great job but the materials of construction prevented me from finding out. The gears were made from plastic and stripped on the second apple. I wouldn't recommend buying this peeler unless the manufacturer changes the material of construction....
2,Only as good as the blade,"When this was new it worked very well. Four weeks later the blade began to catch on the peel, and the handle pops off when it does. It's a razor blade, basically, so it will wear and it can't be sharpened.Mine came with one extra blade which was easy to change. I have not been able to find replacement blades. If they aren't reasonable and readily available, I will reluctantly throw this away.Update - the 2nd blade did not fix the catching problem. Maybe it became dull sitting in the air for 6 weeks. Or something may have broken in the mechanism.Lowering to two stars. Great idea, poor durability/reliability."
5,Great Product. Super Price.,"I ordered this after looking around the internet for a reasonably priced presenter with a mouse. The reviews on Amazon helped me decide to buy this and I am not disappointed. Tiger Direct is a great company to buy from and they ship immediately. I am completely satisfied and recommend this to others.Pros;Price, options, ergonomics, ease of use,Cons; The mouse button takes some getting used to but after all it is not supposed to be a mouse."
2,Hiro Wireless Presenter,"I bought this thinking it would work like a wireless mouse. I could only get it to advance slides, not to actually work as a mouse without having to be stationary on a solid surface as a mouse has to be. I wanted to be able to work the room without being tied to a desk with a mouse."
2,Great While It Lasted,I loved it for the year or so it lasted but now I have a $40 laser pointer. :(
1,Defective Presenter With Laser Pointer And Wireless Mouse,"I was the unlucky recipient of a defective Presenter/Laser Pointer. Initially, I was drawn to this item as it had all of the features I needed at a very reasonable price. Once I received it, I was very disappointed in the unit. It was very difficult to operate since the instructions that came with the presenter were incomplete and very confusing. I had to call the company for an explanation. The help I received from the manufacturer was very good and the wait time was short. However, the gentleman I spoke to was not able to help me as I had received a defective unit. I returned it without issue and have received a refund. I was disappointed in the unit itself as it is made of very light plastic. In addition, once the batteries were installed, the cover for the battery compartment was constantly falling off-very irritating. Others have given this product a sterling review. I however, do not concur as my presenter did not work."
5,Love The Stones on Sullivan,"Can't wait for this release on Tuesday! Some of my favorite songs are on this collection including Paint It Black & Gimme Shelter. The best part is seeing Mick, Keith, Brian and Charlie when they were so young and still making a name for themselves. This is a great collection as we approach almost the 50th anniversary of The Rolling Stones."
4,Wait a few weeks and get ALL 6 SHOWS!!,"Only 4 strs, although this is very important, historical and superb material. But with a complete set on the way that includes ALL SIX episodes with the Stones it seems a bit silly to buy this one now, you either miss out on some fantastic tracks (Around & Around, Time is on my Side, Gimme Shelter, Love in Vain, Honky tonk Women) and an extra booklet with many photo's and a ton of other entertaining material or will find yourself buying that one as well and find that this first release is a bit superfluous.The extra star goes to the other set, for completeness."
3,Works well enough for me,"I've been using this juicer about once a week for over a year without problem. Granted, it is slightly unbalanced and a bit of care needs be taken when pressing on the lever - and you will press hard - but I've never tipped it. Put your other hand on top to maintain balance. OrangeX also seems to have a quality control problem. I've read several complaints about one of the pivots breaking. Again, mine has seen plenty of duty without problem.The juicer is cast iron and HEAVY. The paint is a thick coat of enamel that cleans easily and still looks good. It has four suction cups on the bottom, two of mine have split and no longer stick. The printing on the chrome wore off. With that said, it still works as intended.Four stars because I got mine for under $75. 2.5 stars at Amazon's price."
2,juicer,"This juicer is not weight balanced. When you pull down the handel, the juicer wants to turn over. Causes a messy scean trying to make sure it does not flip over. Also did not get any instructions for using the juicer with it's many parts. Had to learn by trial and error, still not completly sure I am using it correctly."
1,orangex juicer,My orangex juicer broke at the cast iron elbow and a cast joint on the opposite side broke. I was heartbroke and there s no warrenty.
1,Best used as a kitchen ornament and nothing else,"Basically all the negative reviews about this product are true. I would recommend this juicer to anyone who is looking to build upper-body strength while making juice, because the hinges really don't work well after a while (and I've tried lubricating them), so you'll end up exerting all you can just to squeeze an orange. But watch out because the small suction cups aren't enough to prevent it from flipping over when you're putting all that force on the off-center handle.This product was badly designed and is seriously not worth its price tag."
4,works well,"Perfect for small amps. Unfortunately I lost mine during the first week I had it, as it slipped out of the back of my amp while moving from gig to gig. I wish it came with a case or at least a slip sack, then I could have dumped it into a larger gig bag with other gear. When I tried that without a sack, it kept getting tangle in cables or other gear. Needs a case. Not blaming the manufacturers for not providing one, as I guess that keeps the cost down. But if you buy one, don't store it in the back of your amps like I did!"
3,Useful but expensive,Does what it proclaims. Tilts your amp to project the sound to your ears. Essential for playing with other musicians if you want to hear yourself clearly.It is pretty expensive for a fairly simple function. Other issues are that it does not raise the amp above ground level and there is really only one tilt angle.
3,The Voice of Experience,"Written by an experienced church planter, this book seeks to motivate and equip others to do the same. The author believes that planting new churches is the best way to evangelize the lost. He has lived this out: the two churches he founded are responsible for planting more than 200 congregations around the world. The author's methodology is marred in places by a man-centered, ""seeker sensitive"" approach, and the theology is fairly thin. There is scarce mention of the glory of God, the power of the Holy Spirit, the salvation of the lost or the centrality of the Word. A cult using these same strategies would probably grow. Nevertheless, the author provides many points of practical wisdom that, used critically and grounded in a more robust theology, could prove valuable to prospective church planters"
1,Preaching to the Choir A Bit Too Strongly,"I'll admit, not being a Christian, that I'm probably not the target audience for this book. However, as I'd had a positive experience with another book in this genre, I thought that this would be good research for my own spiritual project. Sadly, not all books are created equal. I'll admit the target audience is probably well-grounded Christians; however, I think even they would find this book too over-the-top preachy. The perils of Satan are not probably practical advice to warn new church builders about, and honestly, they turned me off of this title. It was a did not finish (DNF) for me, and I think most people looking to build a church, or other spiritual project, would probably prefer something more practical and less preachy."
2,Meh...,"Funny in parts, but overall pretty weak in terms of its argument. I'm a Democrat, and I felt this book was too partisan, and unfairly so."
2,"Funny, but detrimental to dialogue","FUBAR is well written and mildly funny at times, but it is absolutely vitriolic and unconstructive. As a Christian Liberal, I can cite my grievances with Republican policy all day, but at the end of the day I hope I can an offer a humble alternative too. FUBAR, in its apparent frustration with the last six years, tosses any sort of conciliatory notion out the window and attempts to instill a complete phobia and arrogance toward anything remotely Christian or conservative. The state of (civil) communication is pretty bad now between Left and Right, but books like these are only making it worse."
3,"Frustrating, and not that compelling","The story is that you have 24 hours to crack a safe in a house that is owned by a lock company that prides itself on its uncrackable safes. The clues to crack the final safe are distributed around the various other safes in the house.The main problem with this game is that there is no real mystery to it - you just crack the safes, and that is it. So if you compare it to, say, the 7th Guest or Myst, there is no reason why you want to crack the puzzles, as there is no story to unravel. You're basically walking around an empty house, trying to find your way out.I found the puzzles either too easy, or too difficult. Some of them were fun to unravel, others were simply a question of trying every combination until you found one that matches. But the difficult ones are definitely difficult enough to keep a gamer interested."
1,MAC? I think no,"Yes, the box does say that it is mac compatable, but I bought it for my dad for christmas, and he can not load it on his new MAC, not so happy about this."
5,The best Milkthistle I have ever taken.,"This is the best product if you want to clean up your liver and support it in its work.I feel excellent. I have had eczema almost my entire life.After I started taking it every morning one pill on an empty stomach, it is still there but only I can administer it anymore.No redness no rashes nothing.I would recommend it for anybody and every health condition it cannot harm you only helps to your liver.Superb."
3,from vinyl,"The quality of Nesmith's first three albums is not in dispute. The music contained here is fantastic, if not as richly experimental as the album that followed. However, unless this set has been remastered since its original release - a big if - the music on the first disc (Magnetic South, Loose Salute) is absolutely taken from vinyl sources. In a misguided effort to disguise the many inherent pops & clicks, as well as abundant surface noise (all still occasionally audible), the high end has been mostly stripped leaving the recordings sounding very bassy and tinny in the middle. Loose Salute suffers most from this treatment. The second disc (Nevada Fighter) is also most likely taken from vinyl, though a cleaner source than was used for the first two albums. The unfortunate result is that the rich, warm fidelity of the original LP's is completely missing from this set. This music certainly deserves better, though one could argue it's better to have these tunes this way than not at all."
3,Great Pictures with a large hassle!!!,"I got this photo printer because i love to make my own pictures, give them to friends and have the ability to make the pictures that i want. The picture quality is amazing, exactly like getting them proccessed at a photo place. The huge downfall of this product is the fact that the printer cartridge and paper is almost impossible to get. I didn't mind at first that the paper could only be gotten on amazon, but about 2 months ago i ordered more paper and ink and they kept pushing back the date until they finally canceled my order. I have not been able to use my printer for 2 months! I suggest buying someone that doesn't have such specific ink and paper needed to work it."
1,No paper availability renders printer useless,"I've tried purchasing the paper packages (required for use) for this printer, with no luck at all. Amazon keeps saying that it has some, then cancels my order. MacConnection, PCWarehouse, and all the other online catalogs either don't stock it or don't have it. Have looked for 1 1/2 months now and am considering getting a different printer. Perhaps this is why there are so many for sale ... on zshops."
1,No accessories available,I had bought this printer December 2000 and had no luck as to where to purchase the paper. It's listed online on Sony.com but it's been backordered since December. There's no other paper or ink products that's compatible with therefore making this printer useless.
1,"hard to find paper, paper jams all the time","Although the images are great, when you finally get it to work, the paper is always getting stuck. The paper was very difficult to find. Drivers are near impossible to find... Get the HP photosmart printer (the small one) and you will be thrilled, as I am"
2,LOUD,"Our son enjoys playing with this alot. It would be nice if more of the items were removable like the drill. This toy is so LOUD. I wish I would have known ahead of time that it didn't have a volume control. All in all, it's a toddler pleaser."
4,Sesame Street Sing n' Giggle Tool Bench,"My two year old loves it! He never stops playing with it! I think it's made very well, with a lot of different activities for a toddler. Very easy to assemble. Great value for money spent."
3,"Great toy, Son loves it .....but...",My son loves this toy. We even bought him the tool belt that goes with it. However the sound is VERY VERY loud and it only has one setting. You can also see that other people have reviewed this product and they have stated the same thing. We called Fisher Price and they said no one else has called about this and try to put a piece of tape over the speaker. I tried that with duct tape and as most parents would suspect my son picked at the tape until he got it off. Currently we still put tape on it because he does love the toy but the tape has to be replaced very often. Also the more people call Fisher Price the more likely they are going to do somthing about the sound.
5,Best bench out there,"My son wakes up first thing in the morning and goes to his tool bench, everyday! I bought this for him (for his 1st birthday) two months ago and he plays with all day everyday. He seems to have figured out how to work everything, although the drill is a little big for his hands. This tool bench is also very sturdy--my son is a climber and I will often find him standing on the blue X or he will climb it and sit on top of the bench. Everything on the bench makes a noise of some kind and there is also a button that will play a song. If you get the drill--it fully works and on the tool belt the elmo tape measure talks and tape pulls out. I will mention that my son is 30"" tall and although he can reach everything, it is a pretty tall product.Overall, I give this product five stars. I can see the sense of pride my son felt when he learned how to use the screwdriver. It is really his number one toy. Just don't spend $400 buying it!"
2,TOO LOUD!,"My 19 month old son received this for Xmas. He likes playing with it, since he loves his dad's tools so now he has his own. However, I cannot STAND it. The constant music and talking is so annoying, mostly because it is too loud. Unlike most toys that have 2 volume settings, this one only has one - HIGH. The designers of this toolbench obviously do not have children - if they did, they would have made a low and high volume switch. If you could control the volume, I would have a more positive review on this; I would not recommend this toy if you live in an apartment and have thin walls - your neighbor will want to confiscate it. I wish we had spent the $50 on something else."
2,Complete waste of reading time!,"If you never heard of the Internet, MAYBE this book would be helpful, but for most professionals who understand the dynamics of web strategy, this book is a complete waste of time. It is poorly written and presents arguments in a way that is not straighforward. In additional, the actual arguments are overly simplistic with no practical frameworks. If you want something that packs in a lot more practical knowledge in a concise way, check out ""E-Business: Roadmap for Success"""
1,"Too light, too thin","This book is too thin and fluffy. I managed to get through a few chapters, skipped to the middle, and then gave up. It contains the same standard stories I hear about every day. If it wrapped up uncommon stories, even if they were common sense, it would have some value. Boil it down to a checklist for your operating officer and webmaster, and you'd have it all."
2,No longer lasts the distance,"I came across this book while doing an MBA course where it was recommended reading. While I kind of liked the book I thought it was a little superficial but didn't really have anything to judge it against. Since then, I've read Dalgleish's Customer-Effective Web sites and now I do have something to judge it against. Customers.com was good at it's time but it no longer lasts the distance - Dalgleish's book offers the kind of detail and thorough thinking people always crave from e-commerce books & never get. Do yourself a favor, buy Customer-effective Web Sites."
2,Nothing new,"This book does not have any insight that would be interesting to anyone who is currently working on their internet business. If you are into doing business on the internet, experience internet service as a customer and have a marketing background, nothing in this book is new to you."
5,"The New ""BASICs"" of business","In Customers.com, Patricia Seybold becomes the must read for e-commerce strategies to the degree that Don Peppers and Martha Rodgers has become for one-to-one marketing.Customers.com cuts through the hype and circumstance associated with internet as a beloved communications channel and highlights that e-commerce is more than the user interface. The examples provided will get the readers mind thinking about the data and process infrastructure that must be in place to enable e-commerce in a very simple and clear way. These basics act as good triggers for individuals about to embark on the definition of e-commerce strategies to support their business.I highly recommend this read."
1,Basic story-telling - not what I'd want,"Seybold tells us a lot of stories and examples, but does not include concrete information on how or what should be done in order to really build an customer centric e-business.As a basic, first time introduction it maybe okay - but please don't use this as your guide to building a business. Many better books out there - look for customer care / customer service keywords."
1,Worthless Book With No Real Insight Into E-Commerce,"Unless you are a complete newcomer to the internet and e-commerce this book won't provide you with any useful knowledge. The whole book is just a list of obvious stratagies that could be summarized effectively in just a page or two. Here is an example of the books best advice: ""Focus on the end customer for your products and services"", and ""foster customer loyalty, the key to profitability in e-commerce."" This is basic business folks. Most of the book as nothing to do with e-commerce. The only reasons this book is popular is that it ends in "".COM"" and appeals to the Get-Rich-Quick audience."
3,Good survey of electronic commerce strategies,"Ms. Seybold has produced an excellent review of the elements of a complete electronic business strategy. I was able to find several interesting ideas that I hope to implement in my own business. The strength of the book rests in its ability to present many diverse topics in a well organized manner and in a style that is easy to digest. However, these strengths also give rise to an, at times, rather superficial explanation of complex ideas. My Rx for Customer.Com is to concentrate on fewer topics and then cover those topics in much greater depth. Finally, the constant invention or use of new words to describe ideas that are really only slight permutations of older ideas demonstrates a lack of historical perspective."
2,Decent Insights But Very Repetitive and Basic,"Customers.com gave me some good, basic insights regarding how to approach customers in the ecommerce world. However, I was disappointed at the elementary nature of the book and the constant stating of the obvious.Each chapter is set up with a pair of case studies which are then broken down and analyzed. However, it feels like you're reading the same thing over and over within each study. Seybold constantly repeats the key points and while this might be a beneficial strategy for recollection later on, it makes for boring reading. Customers.com is a good book for High School Seniors on their way to college who are just getting started on the Internet and learning about business. Simply stated, I found the book too repetitive and elementary."
5,customer focused,"after i started reading this book, i could not put it down. very insightful, it cites examples of dotcom companies such as amazon, dell, wells fargo, cisco, etc. whats also great is not just how each company succeeds but the book even mentions the technological infrastructure that the companies put into place(which other e-commerce books do not) an example of this is when the books discusses amazon. ever wonder why your queries are so fast? amazon keeps their entire lists of titles in 1 gigabyte of RAM so customer queries are answered quickly. other examples may be too technical for some but worth knowing nevertheless."
4,Good reference,This is a good reference for anyone concerned with the word e-business as it put across whole gamut in a simple and lucid manner while putting most important word in any business i.e. Customer in the centre.The large number of examples given in the book make concepts crystal clear.And the technical details given about every exmaple is quite helpful in assessing the current technology in terms of use and stability. That makes it useful for the people looking for the technical details as well.Highly recommended.
3,Not as good as people seem to think,"I found the book interesting at first -- liked some of the case studies. After reading a few more, I found them lacking in deeper insights and somewhat disappointing. The intro parts were fine overviews of what's going on, again without being terribly insightful. Case studies were also old - internet time being faster than publishing time might make it hard to be cutting-edge, but it seemed a little out of date."
2,Sad that this book had to be written...,"One customer hit the nail on the head when he said the book was filled with common sense. He meant it as a compliment...I think otherwise. This book has been given far more credit that it deserves. Anyone who has been working on the Web - particularly in ecommerce - longer than six months will find this book boring and obvious. The case studies are interesting, but hardly compelling, and nothing you can't find in Industry Standard or Business 2.0. Quick free lesson - think of how you like to be treated, and treat your customer 10 times better than that."
1,Customer.Con,"If you were expecting revelations then think again. This book is boring, lacks innovation, and plods from one topic to the next.I rekon the top reviews were written by family and friends. Waste of money. Give you money to charity and read the Wall Street Journal's Internet diairy for more substance."
2,Bell Atlantic a case study?,"The author's statement of ""Bell Atlantic puts customer first..."" sounds like a paid endorsement (pp.182). Normal consumer first hand experiences contradict this statement. Try ordering a ADSL line."
2,"Not touching upon the ""real"" topics of eCommerce","This books is, however well written, not touching upon the real issues of eCommerce.It's a strategy book. Fine. But how about putting the strategies into patterns so that the user can see the ""type"" of approach to take for this and that type of business.The second real drawback with the book is that such things as what to do with returns, how to handle the payment process, what CRM-functionality that really put the depicted businesses over the top isn't covered.All in all you get the sense that she's written the book to make a fast buck, and judging by the ranking of this book she certainly is cleaing house."
2,Save your time and money,"Customers.Com could have benefited from an editor with a sharper pencil; the book is about 250 pages too long. The information is useful enough, but not worth wading through the tedious presentation."
2,More like DUH.COM,"A collection of stories that would be interesting in Marketing 101 but not what one would expect from someone who is touted as one of the most influential persons in the IT industry. Granted, if you know next to nothing about E-Commerce then the book is an entertaining introduction and it will get you through most of a coast-coast flight. However, if you are looking for piercing insights this book isn't going to challenge or enlighten."
1,Take a Pass on This One,"Replete with consultant-speak, this book manages to pack lots of pages with very, very few useful ideas. It's astonishing that consultants like Ms. Seybold get away with this stuff, and that publishers buy into it. Let's face it, the primary task of consultants is to make things LESS clear, not more clear because they make money on their consulting fees, not on their books. They want to create confusion, then charge you to clear things up. No thanks..."
3,Good Book - Very Basic in its Approach,Patricia Seybold writes a good overview on the rules that e-commerce sites should use in the design and implemenation of their sites. SOME of the case studies are effective at reinforcing the rules highlighted. I would recommend just reading the introductions for each rule and the lessons learned sections. This is a good read but one in the end that could have been much shorter.
5,"Speed is God, Time is devil but the truth is always customer","This book will guide you on what you focus when you start e-business and how to get the goal through internet. She empathizes on customers who have the bargain power to give us success. I recommmed you should read this book from the starting point of e-commerce, if you are running the business, also you should read it. It may guide you how to serve your customers."
5,much better than others,I love this product because of the features and tactile feel. I bought this and another and this is by far much better
1,Not as good as it looks,The touch pad works fine but the buttons dont work. you probably need a hammer to push the buttons down or know which angle to press. Flimsy body and needs an upgrade along with the buttons.
3,Alright product.,Wont lie. Using this definitely reduces muscle strain on your hand and wrist. Very sleek and very small.I expected it to be bigger than this since it came in a huge box.I don't think it was worth the $35.More like $15. If not $20.
1,money of eddies name,"this book aint about eddie murphy,its about a guy that lived next to eddie when he was a pre-teen,talking bout dinner,lunches with the murphy family,its not bout eddie murphy at all has one photo of eddie and lots of pics of the author,dont waste a dollar on this."
5,The Definitive Peter and the Wolf.,"It is a travesty that neither the cover art nor the Amazon listing mentions that Basil Rathbone narrates and Stowkowski conducts Peter and the Wolf.It has never been done better, and perhaps not even as well. These were two of the world's greatest speakers and conductors at the top of their game.The horns alone make the recording worth having."
1,Don't waste your money,"Lots of words, little solid advice. I recommend you don't spend your money on this book. Lots of theory, lots of history, plenty of pictures but no practical knowledge imparted to the reader. I seriously doubt the author, Pat Ganahl, knows the difference between a combination wrench and a rachet. He does not include any information on Boost-Referenced carbs. And he waffles on whether or not to o-ring the heads/block. He seems to have talked to a lot of people, and never bolted on a blower himself."
1,Hate this thing.,"I hate it, it hates me. Even when rolling the oranges and lemons, making them as soft as can be, it is impossible to use. Good luck squishing it all the way down. I'm not weak, and it was bad on my shoulder and hand. You have to balance the bottom, while swinging the top. Then when you want to take out the fruit, you have to finagle it up and it's a mess. It always gets stuck. Small suction cups are worthless. It came with flattening tool. WHY. I tried to squish strawberries and raspberries. What a joke. We used it five times. The fifth time, the screw that holds the handle on, sheared right off. Returning ASAP!"
4,works very well,"why so many complaints? yes, it is asymmetric. that does put a moment on it. yes, that's what the suction cups are doing. i just bought this about an hour and one half ago. since then, i've juiced 44 limes. the first time i did it, it tipped. no spilling, just a tip and a little splash. after that it, i just held the top and it worked plenty well. as far as force required, it seemed pretty easy to me. cleaning was ridiculously simple. compared to electric juicers, this was trivial. also, i wouldn't leave an electric juicer out on my counter. this i shall.one complaint is that it comes with a plastic platten set for juicing softer (non citrus) fruits like tomatoes and berries, it is supposed to clip in somehow to the device. it appears that the clips are broken. oh, well. i think that it doesn't really need them, anyway.i am pleased with it."
2,Not Really Worth the Hassle,"I have owned my Orange X juice press for four years. I took it to the thrift store this morning and am searching for a replacement. I purchased the juicer with the intent of squeezing lemons, limes and oranges for cooking purposes. It looks nice on my counter and I found it wasn't all that difficult to clean.I have given up on it, however, due to the ""tipping over"" mentioned in previous reviews. I'm not one to give up...so I tried applying pressure to the back of the unit while pulling the lever, but there isn't really any place to hold on to. I tried lubricating the handle and that seemed to help for awhile but I got tired of dragging the thing out to the garage to spray it and fool around with it so I could squeeze a couple of limes for the guacamole. I can't imagine using it to press oranges in any quantity. I think it might work if you could figure out a way to bolt it to your counter?????If the manufacturer fixes the balance issue, I will buy another one."
2,The Wilmar 1384 33 Piece Security Bit Set Review,"The Wilmar 1384 33 Piece Security Bit Review should includethat the order was placed in a business manner, then attendedto promptly. Soon after that the order was shipped; youreceived the product in a regular way. However, you are notsatisfied with the security, since the product has not beenused any further. More security service is needed, the costwill be too much, and you have just touched the ice-burgthat sank the Titanic."
4,Great book!,"We recently went on the West Coast Disney Cruise in August and had a wonderful time. This was our first cruise, so we did not know much about cruising, Disney, etc. The book was well written and gave the pertinent information that was needed to make our trip successful and stress free. I highly recommend it and by reading it, it will make you excited for your trip!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"After years of exercise, Pilates, Yoga, Step, Weight training and most popular forms of fitness, attending both well run classes and using videos for cold winter days, I have never seen such an irresponsible program as this one since the 80's when we still had a lot to learn about exercise injuries. At one point I am doing a floor mat exercise and then there is a brief interruption followed by a standing pose exercise already in progress. Are you kidding. My daughter thought she was giving me a nice Christmas gift but unfortuately it will be returned if possible and if not it will go into the trash. Lets not totally exploit the exercise industry with such poor quality programs. There are many responsible pilates programs as already mentioned in previous reviews. I give this one a half star for the beautiful peaceful setting."
4,Carribean workout pilates,Love the length of these workouts and the choices for each one...can fit it into a busy day
1,Ridiculous shipping charges for the wrong product.,"My mother ordered Secret Crush perfume spray from Perfume99 for one of my Christmas gifts. The shipping was seven dollars, and we recieved the wrong scent. It is too much work to send it back and wait for the correct scent, so I didn't pursue an exchange. However, knowing what I know now, I will not be ordering from this seller again."
1,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye--missing parts ***DO NOT BUY***,"I bought 2, & **both** had the **same** problem---Missing parts make this item useless.It's worthless junk without the missing parts!Truly a pain in the butt.It *also* cost me an extra $60 in handyman fees, when the guy came out and I discovered it was useless.I give this a thumbs down."
5,awesome book,i loved this book in this book we read about mia 16th birthday it was such a cute fun book to read i loved it!
2,Sweet sixteen princess:A princess diaries book by meg cabot,This book is cool and I think people should read all the books from the princess diaries by meg cabot
2,One most poorly designed notebooks on the market,"When I bought my HP Pavillion ZD180 Notebook I was excited about the HT technology and the allure of power that suggested.I soon became disgusted with the design flaw of this notebook, both intake air vents and fans (needed to cool these hot running twin processors) are situated on the bottom of the device. Because this model has an oversized display screen,and a very hungry pair of top end Intel 4's, the battery after boot-up will power device for 2 hours maximum. The fact that you can not use this laptop on your lap makes it a notebook computer,at least that was the official word from HP when 3 months after purchase motherboard melted and HP had it back for a 100% re-fit.Although the service was fast,free and professional, the design flaws outweighed the speed capable by this firecracker of a ""NOTEBOOK"".I call it a firecracker because is races but quickly is a memory.Dave AdamManteo,NC"
3,Joy takes you along on his trip...,"""The Last Rock Star Book or: Liz Phair, a Rant"" alternates between funny and disturbing, deep and superficial. Though I bought it because I'm a Liz Phair fan, the emphasis should really be on ""Rant"" rather than Phair. Not that there's anything wrong with that.Joy adequately captures the essense of teenage (or twenty-something, or thirty-something) rebellion, and the allure of sex, drugs & rock n' roll. He takes you along as he probes the recesses of his mind & memory, while sniffing glue and chatting with his pocket tape recorder. At worst confusing and at best intriguing, this is a good read for the original MTV generation."
4,The Next Best Thing To Five Stars,"Simply put, very informative, holds your interest. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5, is that you should always check with your doctor before doing any tests at home, but they are all relatively safe. I condone the book for anyone at home who is worried, or at the least - impatient!"
5,Great Book! Too realistic to be just fiction!,"The book is purportedly fiction, however, judging from the insight and history of the author you realize as you read that this account must be based on facts.It is an extremely engaging novel that captures what life must have been like in the first years of Castro's dictatorship.It is important that those of us outside the exiled Cuban community learn of the atrocities that have been and still are committed by Castro and his lackeys just miles from our shores.The characters are well defined and the book's organization is flawless. The day it came I couldn't put it down and finished it in one sitting.Escape from Castro is a novel that will stay with me long after Castro is gone!"
2,Not nearly as cute as in the photos,"The shell part is not soft or plush, it's kind of like pleather. Plus, it is sort of ugly, it's snout is much longer and skinner than that in the photo and the coloring is darker. It could just be that I got a dud, but it sure isn't sweet looking like the one pictured ( yeah, I know, it *is* an armadillo). The packaging could have been better. It came in a padded envelope and one side of the shell is squished up."
2,the longest week in my life,"i read this on kindle dx and premise sounded interesting. it was a LONG ebook. at bottom of screen where it has location/progress meter it clocked in at more than 17000. the author put in too much scientific jargon. it felt like a biology book at times ( and i hated biology in HS) i forced myself to continue reading at times skipping over many many pages. finished yesterday.. it was such an unpleasant experience that i doubt i would ever read this author again.TOO WORDY and the ending was crappy too,"
4,Good story.,Well written novel with many aspect relevant to today's world environmental issues. Schatzing maintains a good pace throughout the novel keeping you on the edge of your seat.
2,"Good premise but overlong, poorly paced, and poorly edited.","As an avid reader of science fiction and apocalyptic fiction I thought that I would thoroughly enjoy this book. I am not daunted by large books and I love ""hard"" science fiction (based on real science) but over 1/3 of the book is comprised of lengthy explanations with an obvious nod to the reader. Many of the explanations, such as with ""methane hydrates"" occur more than once and other things such as DNA are well known enough by the average person to skip. The pacing is also poor enough to become irritating with about one thing of interest happening every 100 pages or so. It also, unfortunately, breaks the cardinal rules of ""never make your main character annoying"" and ""never assume your audience is stupid"". A good editor would trim about 200 - 300 pages off this mess. The premise is quite good and it would make a good film but someone needs to take the scissors to the story and clean it up."
4,Definitel worth the read!,"The Swarm was one of the best reads I've had in a while. While hefty, at over 800 pages, it had so much going on that I didn't seem to notice, and almost wondered as I got nearer to the end if they'd have enough room! There are some errors with the translations, and one part got me as they mention Deep Impact and Bruce Willis together. (Bruce was in Armageddon, while similar - it's a different movie.) Little things like that though are quickly forgotten as events unfold. I've recommended it to a few of my friends, and have heard good things from them as well. I recommend getting this book, and diving right in - just stay out of the water!"
3,posted in the forum before - but Swarm and translation thoughts,"Hello there - I read Der Schwarm in the German and the English, and I have to say, to be fair, that the comments made about the translation, such as wordiness and even particular phrases like General Commander are translations of the original, which meanders on a bit and does have some unusual wordings. Quite tricky cos it isn't the translator's job to change the style.Also, the English version seemed to have bits cut out of it compared to German - I review quite a lot of German books, and they are often a bit long for us English speakers so the publishers tend to knock the translations back a bit in length. Grammar mistakes from cuts are really down to the copy-editor to correct, not the translator (I say this as an editor, so I'm probably cutting off my nose to spite my face here)Overall, it was a pretty good thriller though I thought."
1,Worse than chocolate whip cream.,"What the hell was this book about? I just finished it and I can't think why I stuck with it so long. Pick any negative review and just believe it. This was more disappointing than when I tried the chocolate whip cream in a can. Yes, they make chocolate whip cream. And it is terribly disappointing, but much less so than this book."
2,"Preachy, bloated, and....","..this 800 pages could have been pared down by half and still gotten the story across. The thinly veiled anti-American theme became tiresome, as did the-humans-are-destroying-the-world mantra that was relentlessly hammered upon.I'm all for intelligently written sci-fi thrillers, but this one gets a wee bit too technical for entertainment. A Hollywood film might even be welcome, as a film has @ 2 hours to tell the story. All the exteraneous BS from the book will winnowed out."
4,Good science oriented fiction,I learned a lot about drilling for oil in the ocean and also quite a bit about various forms of sea life. Sometimes the detail interfered a bit with the story line.
4,"Entertaining, thought-provoking, and several hundred pages too long","There's a lot of great material in The Swarm: good writing, impressive research, solid story development, decent characters. The many many parts of this novel were terrific in themselves. In the end, though, the whole of this novel was rather less than the sum of its parts. Why? On the one hand, because the novel wraps up very quickly and pretty unsatisfyingly. On the other hand, because a lot more is stuffed into this novel than need have been. As enviro-apoctalypto-thrillers go, The Swarm is very good, and surprisingly (not to mention creepily) believable. It's well worth an investment of readerly time. Just not quite so great an investment as one must make to labor through its just-shy-of-900 page count. I'd definitely read Schatzing again the next time I'm in the market for a Michael Crichton-style read. But I might balk if it's similar in heft. Overall, the Swarm is a decent novel that could have used some very robust editing."
3,Disappointing ending,"Some great ideas here and some very long tedious passages. The ending was terribly disappointing after more than 800 pages. Too many characters to keep straight, many of which not well-developed at all. I've never been opposed to reading long books, but there's a great deal that could be excised here. No regrets though - I'm glad I read it. Definitely not a book for everyone. It takes commitment to finish."
5,Full of fantasy and surprise,"Absolut geniale Erz√§hlweise. Der Autor √ºberrascht den Leser immer wieder. So f√ºhrt er liebevoll Charaktere ein, die die Hauptfigur w√§ren, l√§√üt sie aber sterben. Und der Leser denkt bis zu letzt an die wundersame Rettung (das ist ja immer so) ... aber es kommt keine. Cool.Der Author sagt Tsunamis voraus und hat auch sonst sehr gr√ºndlich recherchiert. Und entwickelt daraus fantasievoller Zukunftsperspektiven, von denen einige durchaus wahr werden k√∂nnen."
4,Great read!,This was an excellent surprise for the price it was being sold for (5.99) The stiry is excellent with a great twist (totally unexpected) at the end. At time it does bog down with details and theory but it always manages to keep moving along. You definitely get a good feel for the main players in the story. There was many a night I couldn't wait to get the time to read another chapter. I would highly reccommend this enviromental thriller.
4,Classic Global Terror Novel With Interesting Spin,"Frank Schatzing's first novel translated to English, ""The Swarm"", is an epic of monumental proportions that devises an end-of-humanity threat from the very oceans on this planet.Thoroughly engaging with well-drawn characters, ""The Swarm"" will have you turning the pages furiously. At nearly 900 pages (hardcover!) be prepared to devote a lot of time to tackling this tome. The plot does tend to veer at times into unecessary tangents (several chapters devoted to the funeral of one of the lead characters fathers that lends little to the plot) but the pay-offs are big and often unexpected.The ending gets somewhat over-preachy and philosophical/theological but the questions left unanswered provide nice food for thought. If you can get past the extreme anti-American and anti-Christian tone you should be entertained to the end. Heard a rumor that Uma Thurman and a group purchased the film rights - would like to see what they do with that..."
4,Great summer read,"I wont go on and on about the book, but this is a great summer read. A total thriller, I had a hard time putting it down. Most of the other reviews already give an outline of the plot. The Writer must have done reams of research to tell his this storyThe only drawback are the obvious political leanings of the writer. He doesn't especially care for Americas role in the world and it comes through loud and clear. On one side are the sophisticated European Scientists willing to ask the hard questions and look for logical solutions. On the other are the crude Cartoonish Americans who are basically at the root of all of the problems, and whose crude military knee-jerk solutions just make things worse. Oh well, it was still a good book."
5,VERY GOOD BOOK!,"This book is great.It was better than i have expected. Its a very intelligent written book and Frank did a great job doing his research. I admire how he put so much knowledge in this book. The Story keeps you going and you wonder what will happen next. There is one chapter that i didnt like when one of the main charakters went home and did some soul searching (I thought that was boring) but its been only 10 pages.If you want to gain some knowledge and look for a interesting story that will blow your mind, this is the book to read. I highly recommend it!"
4,Good book but long,The Swarm is a good book. The story was very interesting: intelligent sea creatures destroying the human race. The problem is the book is way too long. I skipped alot of explainations and boring stories about the characters. If the book was about 300 pages shorter I would have given it 5 stars.
2,Could Have Been Very Good,Though the book is a little long and a little wordy - which I don't mind being a Peter F. Hamilton fan - I enjoyed the first 850 pages. That last 50 pages was pure junk and ruined the entire book. Don't waste your time and money. I'm sorry I did.
4,My kids love slot machines...,"My kids saw these at a resort gift shop in Lake Tahoe. We bought two, dropped one by accident on our driveway and bought a replacement on Amazon. They played with them quite often when they first got them."
3,Average slot machine toy,What can you expect of a cheap toy. It worked like it said. Fun for about 5 minutes.
4,Amazing read,"I like a good uncomplicated sci fi from time to time and Solaris did not disappoint. After watching the movie for the third time recently I really wanted to finally check the book out so it could shed more light on the characters for me. Well it did not disappoint. It's not a very long book and I do like the way the writer drifts off for a few chapters to give the planet Solaris it's own history and back story, which filled in a few plot holes from the movie. But all in all and at the heart of it a really great, sad and tragic love story."
4,Solaris,Well written and translated. Interesting sci fi reading. Not complicated or heavy as some sci fi stories. The first Solaris film made in 1972 and the Western version 2002.
3,Bad translation,"I have not read the English translation but from what I have hear the re seems to be some character name changing (Snow), some place changing - Kelvin arrives to a sattelite orbiting Solaris... et cetera.but, what would you expect of a double translation"
2,yawn......,"A solid and interesting premise, but Lem sadly fails to make it work. I found myself wondering what was the point of the book and waht was happening. There isn't really any mystery (although at times it get creepy) the reader already knows the nature of Solaris. Nothing is really accomplished in the end and i felt almost as if I was reading an incomplete story. Oh yeah, Event Horizon was a ripoff of this book."
2,Horrifically boring,"I read the first chapter of this book in the store and I thought it would be an awesome book so I bought it. then the next chapter mind as well have been written in swaheelee. And this went on and off through-out the book. some chapters the author was describing weird pointless stuff, and then others it was back to the story. It is not a very exciting book and maybe when I grow up I'll understand, but besides the intresting plot, it gets old after a while and the book gets seriously boring. read this book at your own risk, but remember that you were warned."
2,Misogynistic Drivel!,"Nothing happens. The main character spends virtually all of his time reading books from the space station's library. We're treated to his review of the literature.But that's not what disturbs me most. This book is appallingly sexist. There is one ""woman"" in this story. Of course, she is young, beautiful, child-like, passive, and stupid--so stupid that she's easily manipulated by a little techno-speak. She exists to comfort the main character and has no needs of her own. At one point the two male characters discuss how easy it would be to dispose of (murder) her if she were only an old hag. The backstory includes a manufactured history of Solaris that includes hundreds of explorers and scientists, none of them women. And the book doesn't get a pass because of its age. The woman's movement was robust in the 80's.I gave it two stars instead of one because I liked the concept of a sentient ocean."
4,Interesting to say the least,The opening is like playing a first person video game. Just instantly thrown into the story. It's full of intrege and wonder. A constant question of 'What exactly is going on here?' The novel really brings to light about the human condition and just how little we really know about the human mind.
3,Dis-formed:,"The hard back is old and weathered. The spine leans to one side. Other then that, it is readable.I would like to find another copy but in much better condition.Thank you Kirk"
2,"Promising, but meandering","A promising, suspensful, and occasionally dramatic first half is squandered by verbose fictional scientific and historical sections that needlessly fracture the narrative, in my opinion. I felt like there was real potential in the premise but I need more zing in my SF."
4,"Spooky, & strangely moving.","At first this reminded me more of Poe then anything. I've read little science fiction from the non- English world & for some odd reason all the sf novels I've read from the non-English world have been French. Until this book that is. Lem creates a creature so alien that at times I found it quite frustrating. In fact Solaris is about as alien & inscrutable as you can get. I should warn you that I read history books for fun so the long history sections interested me, but might bore you to tears. Also this was a much quicker read then I expected. There's something about this book that turns me off, but I had to reward the writing & imagination of it."
4,Highly philosophical; Short; Moody to Depressing,"This book will make you think, even if you think regularly. Many dislike this book because it is ""drab"", ""descriptive"", ""depressing"", ""philosophical"", ""open-ended"". Yes, the language and description are rather tedious, occasionally. Yes, the subject matter is serious and pessimistic. However, this is a great book, a classic, imperfect yet substantial. Its mood and subject matter remind me of Sartre, who admittedly is not for everyone yet did receive a Nobel prize. It is not your typical scifi thriller, but rather uses scifi techniques to efficiently and tangibly explore modern philosophical themes. And rest assured that after Lem's made his point, he'll end his book. Which may give you 2-3 days you might have spent reading another book to contemplate this one. Contrast this book to, say, those of C.S. Lewis. Same length, similar themes, opposite influences/mindset."
5,Solaristics,"Good science fiction rarely focuses solely on the technical aspects of a story. Rather, it builds characters on a foundation of humanistic questions. ""Solaris"" is a perfect example of that.The story is relatively straight-forward and from the view of the protagonist. It deals with the ever-changing nature of Science and the prepetuality of man's inability to ""Know thy self.""In ""Solaris,"" the planet Solaris is a non-scientific thorn in the side of Science. As people change, so does Science, but Solaris remains as perplexing as ever. To add to this conundrum, men of Reason are sent to the surface where they encounter an almost humanistic entity which doesn't fit into the notions of their discipline.As a side note, the technology which is specifically addressed in ""Solaris"" is quite dated and usually a poor prediction, but Stanislaw Lem makes the story conciously (and wisely) detach from such crude guesswork."
4,CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE THIRD KIND...,"Having seen the film that starred George Clooney and was based upon this book, and having found it wanting, I decided to go to the source. I am glad that I did, as it is certainly better as a book than it is as a film. It is also far more profound than the film, which concentrated on the love story.This book is much more than that, covering many themes. It is, first and foremost, about contact with an alien entity and communication of a type beyond our comprehension. Is it friend or foe? Who can say, as the source of the communication makes its pitch based upon an individual's memories, some good, and some bad? What it is communicating remains unfathomable. Still, the book provides much food for thought."
3,Well done... but may get you down,"This is very well done but do not get it if you're looking for slasher-variety gore, as its advertising suggests. Technically I guess it's a ""mystery-thriller"" as stated in the synopsis - but it's primarily a deeply sad, relentlessly serious contemplation of loss and guilt, and even though it's well cast, acted and scripted, it may get you down. Only for viewers who don't mind serious - even solemn - fare!"
1,"A waste of time - it ""stole"" 90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back","This movie sounds great on paper, but in my opinion suffers from bad script and bad direction. The main plot in present day is poorly developed and not at all interesting. The sub plot, which takes place 50 years earlier, is at least a little interesting. The two plots develop (or not) and then at the end when you realize how they are connected, it's completely anti-climactic. I thought Jon Hamm would save it, but no. The only redeeming quality is Josh Lucas, the main character in the sub plot. He's the best part of this movie and an actor that I hope to see more. Other than that the movie seems like an amateur effort."
4,Above average murder mystery that spans decades,"Jon Hamm does a great job here as a detective whose son goes missing and who also ends up investigating another case of a missing boy from 50 years earlier. Much of the movie is given in flashbacks, while the present shows what a strain the detective is under because of the conflicts with his wife and his own strong feelings.James van der Beek, a long way from Dawson's Creek, also turns in a good performance as a hired hand who knows something about the 1958 case.Worth a look."
1,movie scrambled in middle of movie,"movie scrambled in middle, could not watch that part of the movie, I have not contacted anyone about this movie"
5,My New Favorite Hat!,"How much do I love this hat - well how much time to do you have? If you want to be noticed, admired and complimented wherever you go, then this is the hat for you. I love, love, love it! Soooo much better than the picture. It's soft, well made, satin lined and totally divine when worn! It's my new favorite hat! Ferdy Girl in Colorado"
2,Disappointed,I purchased this for my husband. He suffers from chronic neck pain and has had a previous surgery for it. He said this actually made his pain worse. It is very firm and doesn't really seem to mold to shape very well.
5,great item,a gift for my daughter she was very pleased with itgot here on time and in great shape good buy for anyone
1,Pass on this Twilight book-- Maggie Shayne's worst book to date!,"I am a huge fan of Maggie Shayne's so I was very disappointed with this book. Ms. Shayne relied too much on the success of her past Twilight books to carry her through this one.I couldn't have cared any less for Max & Lou, and certainly didn't feel any romance between them. This book seemed thrown together to satisfy the Twilight readers' desire for another in this series. I hope her next one is more like the older books in the Twilight series. Before I waste money buying the next one, I will read through it to see if she's gotten the spark of the eary Twilight books back."
3,"Entertaining, and needed, but not really that interesting.....","I have read all the others and could not put them down. This is a good book if you have not read her others in the vampire series. it just isn't as good as the others.First of all, you have to stop and go back in time because the book is basically a bunch of missed details from previous books. Honestly, I wasn't that interested in the characters when they showed up in the previous books, so to start reading it and realize that the entire book are these characters that bore me to death was very disappointing.The details are interesting, and needed for the next book which seems WAAAAAAAY better, but won't be out for quite some time. A complete teaser book.Like I said before, if you don't already read and adore her other vampire books, then this is probably a pretty good book for you, but I just found it lacking in the qualities the other books are abundant in."
3,Blue Twilight falls short,"Being a book in the Twilight series you have a certain expectation: that the two main characters -one being human the other being vampire- will fall in love. Lou and Max, both human, are simply two characters that frankly I skipped over in the previous novels because their story didn't hold my interest. Now if this novel was not packaged in the Twilight series cover it would have been a GREAT book. I was just expecting what I was accustomed to. The vampire plot line was, however, a bit weak. The opening scene, in which he dines upon the tasty neck of his victim laid foundation for a really complex character...but then he became this weak wuss. I hope Ms. Shayne realizes that I can fall in love with a bad guy...even evil guy...and makes him more tortured in the next book."
2,Rather empty and contrived,"This book suffered from severe perspective lapses. It used third-person omniscient, and it really killed any and all dramatic tension. The vampire was barely evil, barely dark, barely anything more than a glamorized stereotype.The characters' dialogue was also highly unbelievable and forced."
3,Blue Twilight,"Backtracking in her continuity, Ms. Shayne gives her readers the long demanded tale of Max (Maxine) and Lou who she had skipped over a bit to give Amber Lily her own story. Classic traditions are adhered to - to an extent, such as the setting, a rather rural New England town that seems to be a haven of normal conceals a darkness that has begun to claim innocent lives. In this epic battle, Max's greatest strength is the greatest liability as well. Together with Lou, she battles an ancient evil that lusts for power and twisted love.*** Though a bit less compelling than the earlier books in the Twilight series, fans will undoubtedly enjoy having a few holes in the timeline plugged. The most interesting turns of the plot occur near the end, and the pacing is a bit slower than normative for this series. ***"
4,Worth reading,"I ordered Korsgard as an accompaniment to Philippa Foot"" ""Natural Goodness"", Unfortunately this has not yet arrived, but I'm finding Korsgard an interesting and adventurous search for ethical sources"
2,Not worth it.,"Some interesting things here and there, but mainly bad. Korsgaard says this: Other's needs are necessarily a reason for me to act, because I can understand what they say when they state that they have needs. In the mere act of understanding you when you say, ""I need Help!"" I must understand that there is a reason for me to help you. But Korsgaard's theory is not even worth considering. From your having a reason to get help and my ability to understand that you do, it doesn't follow that I have a reason to help you. Amoral jerks can understand you perfectly well, but they have no reason to help you. But this rationalist line is very dignified and exciting, so you can be a famous Harvard professor if you proclaim it. Don't say true things, just say exciting ones. That's what makes for good philosophy, right?"
3,Good but not Great,"Kurt and his guys are crisp as usual. The song slections, usually Kurt's strong suit are not very interesting on this one. "" Feel So Smoochy will never be a jazz classic and the same for ""Best Things Happen while your Dancing'. Try others by Kurt."
3,This time it's not exactly jazz...,"While obviously musically gifted, Elling and his kind of music are too ""hep"" for those of us who are more genuine jazz oriented. I'm not implying that this isn't a decent album, but it gets too modernistic for my tastes. I'll stick with the old greats and go to see Elling at the Green Mill now and again for a change."
1,Waste of money,Waste of money. I put it on my silk sheets and they popped off within minutes of laying down on the bed.
1,TERRIBLE,"This product must have been made for a baby bed. They did not fit and the sheets slipped off more than before I purchased the ""grippers.:"" They need to be longer!"
1,Does not work,The concept is good but it would not hold our sheets in place. It was very difficult to get the sheet to slide in clasp. Do not waste your money.
1,Fell apart while attaching them to the sheets,"I had some of these grippers at one time that worked and worked well. This set, however, came apart while putting them on the sheets for the first time. I couldn't use them, so even though they were cheap it was a waste of time and money getting them."
4,They are OK,"No problem with the shipper, the package got here quickly. Not much to like or dislike about a piece of elastic with clips on the end. So they are suitable for the purpose intended."
2,Surprised,I was very disappointed with this product. It was poorly constructed. It did not tighten the sheet on my bed. It did not stretch enough. After a few days the hook broke. This product was not what I expected.
1,Save your money,"Seller should discontinue product. It is shoddily made and a complete waste of money. Does not grip, does not hold, twists easily during application,the holds deform immediately upon first use, attatchments break with alacrity. Seller beware. This low quality product will hurt your ratings."
1,waste of money,"These are advertised as being the solution for sheets and mattress pads that won't stay on the bed. They were garters, as expected, but so puny that they won't go over the thin edge of the mattress pad. So then I tried to put them on my son's sheet corners, instead. They would not even go over the elastic edge on the sheets. Very disappointing!!!Need to go back to the drawing board."
1,not worth the money,I purchased these in hopes of keeping my sheets snug on my pillow top. No such luck. They are poorly made and I haven't been able to attach them to any sheet I own. Neither thin nor thick sheets will fit into the clasps. They are pretty much impossible to attach and not like the older sheet suspenders. Steer clear !
2,very cheap quality,their are a lot of better sheet grippers out there guys. these ones happen to be of very low quality.
1,Sheet straps,These are very difficult to put on and don't really stay. Do not recommend them. Something with simple clips would be much better.
3,A Little Hard to Handle,"These work pretty well. They are a little hard to handle for older folks with arthritic hands, because they are all plastic and slippery and thick. and they don't work well on fabrics that are sturdier than sheets. I wish the loops were metal, like they used to be."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed in this product, because I assumed it would be the ones that you could simply snap on. However, they work okay, they just seem old fashioned."
1,These clips do not work,"these plastic clips are virtully impossible to use, the button type clipping is only for ultra thin sheets. I do not advise buying these."
1,sheet grippers dont,"I ordered these sheet grippers because I have fitted sheets that come loose from the corners and the product picture showed it holding corners of fitted sheets.It took me at least 15 min. to get both ends of one gripper attached to one corner. While trying to get a second corner attached, the first one came loose. After a few attempts and getting no further than one corner I gave up. The problem seems to be that while the diagram shows the gripper on a fitted sheet, the elastic of the sheet is too thick to allow the grippers to close securely. I was trying this on a satin sheet. I can't imagine trying to close the gripper on a thicker linen sheet."
5,Sheet Grippers,"This Items does what it says it will do, Daughters fav sheets lost elastic these grippers hug sheets nice and tight."
2,Somewhat dissapointed.,"Two of the straps broke after my first bed sheet change. I still have the other two and they manage to keep the sheet on the mattress fine, but the sheet is quite loose."
4,Will someone please promote these boys...,"Get Down or Lay Down was a hot cd, but everyone slept on it because the only promotion it got was because of people liking Cross the Border and Please Don't Mind. I figured it for a fluke and assumed they would blow up on their next cd. I was wrong. The only weak part of Ring the Alarm is its length, yet once again, nobody knows about it. If someone at Universal would give these cats a little money for a video, they could blow up because Dust Ya' Boots is as hot of a song as anything out right now. Bonic and Mr. even stepped up their flow a little bit on this cd, but it doesn't matter because they don't get any promotion. I am a big fan of Young Gunz and the Roc, but I think Philly's Most Wanted is the hottest rap duo out of Philly. Maybe if someone pays them to cuddle with puppies and play in the snow in a video they can blow up too (that must have been Neef's idea because I know Young Chris wasn't feelin' that)."
5,This Is Great,I really like this Cd. Most of the songs in this Album are really great... Dust Ya boots is really good to.. I like the Beat to the song Ring the Alarm. But that isnt the Only song that i like in that song.. Dust ya Boots has a really good beat to it. I really like the song called My Baby.. that is my favorite song. It has a nice beat and has nice lyrics. I also like the song Clutch Shooters. I really like the Whole CD.. it is really GOOD...6/19/2004
5,better than the last,this cd is better than there last one which had about two or three decent songs. however this cd has more than four bangers. that i think could help establish P.M.W. as a legit group.
5,Get them on the radio,"Why arnt they played on the radio? This is an unbelievable cd, as well as inspiring. This CD is better than most mainstream rap CD's, it is a shame that these guys are not getting promoted, because if someone big picked them up, aka Kanye, G-Unit, they would explode. And for the Neptunes, they are idiots for dropping them for the Clipse....talk about a waste of money.Top 5 Songs:1. Dust Ya Boots2. Memory Lane3. Clutch Shooters4. Away From Here5. My Baby"
3,just okay,"This book looked great on the outside, but the items inside were not as interesting to me as the hat was. But, I guess that is a chance you take when you order site unseen."
5,International Buffet,"This album encompasses every corner of the globe. You get a taste of all the different elements each culture offers in music. Beautiful, haunting, thought-provoking..."
5,fascinating!,Loved this book! The info is fascinating esp. all the case studies and personal stories of famous people and real people as well. Provides great insight in howour mind and body work together.
5,Gabor Mate excellent !,"He makes so much sense, it is amazing! Saw him speak last summer at a Women's Symposium for work and knew immediately who was getting a copy of this book... sent it to my sis in law who lost her husband last year (my brother) and she is so grateful."
1,"Shallow, shallow, shallow","I was attracted by the word 'editor' and what that role would have entailed at such a successful magazine. Instead it was just a bunch of memoirs that went through her sex life, her eating obsessions and her deathly grip on her husband. Never again."
5,"I can't read Italian, but...",...the music on this CD sounds just as good as it did when I owned the English language LP version originally released by Varese-Saraband Records. If you're a fan of the film get this soundtrack!
4,Pretty good,It's just like the cartoon series.My brother (7 yrs. old) can play this game for hours. I play it (18 yrs. old) and find it enjoyable. It gives you something to do on those slow days.There are mini missions you have to complete. You're given awards and extras to the game after each completion.I'd say it's 100 hours to complete the whole game. (I've done 60% in one day... but that could just be me. I normally devour any game I get.)The graphics is great; the story is great; it's amusing; a little too colorful but you get used it.
2,uhh....really not that good at all,"i'm a fan of the show and a fan of playing entertaining mindless games to pass the time so i dont realize how meaningless my life has become, but this game is BORING. when you win levels, you're granted something like.. a SILLY outfite. OOOH!!! i cant wait. i mean my time is pretty worthless, but not to that extent. its frusturating remembering all of the eds special skills.. which are all basicaLLY ridiculous. i dont suggest anyone waste their dough on this. and get their son slash daughter something a lot more entertaining. ide rather just watch the show. werd"
4,I have no catchy title,Although not drawn by elfquests original artist this is undoubtably one of the best non wendy books.Theres no way to sum up all the great moments of the shards war.You sit through the agonizing loss of characters you have never met yet seem to know like your best friends and you cheer along with the rebellion and final victors.The story sucks you in and you find yourself crying laughing and not being ashamed of it.So...A awesome book but not to be read in the company of strangers.They may give you funny looks.
5,Spiritual Desire,"I thought I was purchasing the devotional and got the book, I think it could have been made more plainer what the item was."
5,What's the question?,"In Dr. Menahem's book, he doesn't disappoint. After his first book and after taking a class with him at Columbia, I expected nothing less than humor mixed with compassion and grace ... the book is firmly constructed within and outside the walls of classic to experimental philosophy/psychology. Delightful!! Just like Sam, er, Dr. Menahem."
5,Psychology values Religion,"Dr. Sam Menahem is gaining a growing reputation for his spiritual insights related to psychotherapy and counseling. In his latest book, he presents compelling cases and ideas on the importance of prayer for our emotional health. I found his chapter on forgiveness to be especially worthwhile. Those in the helping professions, as well as lay readers, will find this book a valuable resource."
5,Loaded with creative ideas!,"This book is loaded with both ideas and step-by-step plans on creative financing for your real estate investments, your own business or for any profitable venture you can imagine. One of the best books on getting cash when you need it!"
1,A waste of time and money,"Given the glowing ratings by previous reviewers, I expected good things from this book. I kept it aside for my beach reading on our holiday - thank goodness I brought something else. This book cromprises a bunch of no-brainer solutions that my seven-year-old could easily come up with and, rather than prescribing solutions that really conquer clutter, provides tips on ways to stash it out of sight...presumably so the reader has room for more clutter."
5,The Most Thorough Book for Do-It-Yourselfers,"I own a 1990 German built Jetta and have tried the Haynes manual for '75 through '92 models with little help. The Haynes is based on a complete teardown and rebuild of an older, gasoline vehicle. It doesn't discuss Diesel or Turbo Diesel, and it omits features found in later models, such as cruise control, and does not provide and explanation of determining what model you have. This book, published by Bentley Publishers, is more extensive and has far better illustrations and wire diagrams. My advice: if you want to save money fixing your VW yourself, skip the Haynes manuals and get this book."
5,A must have for VW owners,"If you want to work on your VW yourself this is the best book you can get.The Bentley manual has almost 1,000 wiring diagrams, compare that to the haynes manual wich has 20. For all my vehicles I've previously owned I had Haynes manuals, after discovering the bentley manual I'm mad I wasted all that money and time not understanding how to properly execute the simplest tasks. This manual has over 5 times the information of other manuals.YOU MUST GET THIS BOOK."
5,The Best book you can buy for your 85-92 VW,It is the best book because it explain you the fonction of every parts and how to check if it's work well. You must buy this book if you own a A2 volks. The money you will save even if you go to the repair shop worth the price of the book buy 1000 times...It is alsow a good reference book if you want to put a passat 2.0L 16V engine in your golf and jetta because the book cover this engine and you have all the wirings diagrams you'l need to do the swaap... very helpfull!!!
1,Disappointing... Very elementary advice,"When I saw the title of this book I was thrilled -- it was exactly what I was looking for! But I was very disappointed when I began reading it. I hoped the book would get better with each chapter but it only got worse... The chapters based on age are very limited and short. It was so basic and boring that I was shocked this book even got published. It explains many ""no-brainer"" to parents of twins. An example is that it takes the time to explain that fraternal twins were created with two eggs and identical twins with one egg. I'm guessing the majority of twin parents already knew that...I would love to find a book that provides tips in raising twins after the infant stage -- but this book is NOT it."
3,Looking for more specific hands-on ideas,"I just got this book (my twins turn 1 in a few days) and eagerly read through the first several chapters. It was an entertaing, fun read, but I was a little dissapointed. I was just hoping for more tricks, ideas, and hands-on suggestions. Perhaps it will be more useful when my twins are older."
5,"excellent, saves the consumer $$$$, 1st book written for me","This book has saved me major $ from the sale of my home to the purchase of a new one. Mr. Howard cover it all from credit cards, credit reports, buying cars etc..... This book was written for me (the consumer)and I will recomend that all my friends buy, plus I have bought serveral copies for Christmas gifts..."
5,Clark ComesThrough!,"Clarks newest book is excellent!!! Well written andeasy to read. It is a good read cover to cover, or as a flip thorughreference for what you need at the current time. This book has already saved me the purchase price. However, a word of Clark like advice: I bought mine at costco and Clark even signed it. Dennis"
2,Damaged...,"I'm not sure if I just got 2 bad eggs, but both of my binders arrived with rips in the seems... I can still use them, but next time I'll just go to Wal-mart..."
3,Binder Business,"I use the same rules for binders that I use for ink reviews...it's a binder, if it works than I have no complaints. If anything I'm worried that I may need a bigger size for the multitude of readings I get as part of my grad seminar, but that's a fault in my product selection rather than the actual product itself. It works for my needs and that's all I really care about."
2,Defective,The binder I got had rings that didn't align probably. It ate into the pages so in the end I had to contact customer service. I think these should be purchased in stores so you can check it over before buying. Returning and re-buying is a pain.
3,Not as described,"The description posted for this binder is for the ""heavy duty"" binder (according to the insert received with the binder), not the ""durable"" one, which is the one I received and how the item is labeled. According to the label that comes inserted in the front clear cover, the ""durable"" binder has these features: ""frequent use, holds more paper than round ring (this has d-rings installed on the inside back cover), smooth page turning, dividers won't stick out, and two interior pockets."" It does not have a ""one touch ring"" or four interior pockets. Not sure if it's ""gap-free;"" will have to use it to find out. Not what I thought I was ordering, but too much trouble to send back."
3,Not great for heavy use,"My third-grader uses this everyday, multiple times daily and the binder has not held up very well. The spine it torn a bit but the inner pockets were a bit stronger. I have no doubt this would be perfect for a college student or adult.Good price, good product."
3,"Ok binder, ugly women","The binder is not as durable as the name implies. Also, the women in it were not as attractive as the Avery brand would have you believe. Next time I'll stick with Target binders for my women needs!"
1,Do I have the wrong binder?,"Gabrialla Breathable Elastic Abdominal Binder for Women, Small I was looking for a good binder to put a woman in, and I came up with the Gabrialla elastic abdominal binder, which might work better than one of these for keeping a woman in her place. Costs a bit more than 72 cents on the dollar tho."
3,Not much thinking involved,"This game is supposed to be puzzles and strategy. Most of the safes are solved by codes, which can be found by opening other safes or located with clues scattered throughout the house. There's little thinking involved. Overall, this games is mildly fun, with cool rooms to explore, but is very easy. Don't bother if you're a seasoned puzzler."
3,"Fun, but only for slower systems","It really is amazingly fun to wander around an abandoned house cracking safes. The only problem is that this game is really only possible with an older, slower system, say a 486 or so. My 4-year-old computer was too fast to make it possible to scroll through the inventory list slow enough to actually select items in the middle rather than on one end or the other. Quite frustrating, since by the time I discovered this I was about halfway through -- and now I can't finish. Oh well; that's the price of having up-to-date technology, I guess.UPDATE: If you like the idea of this game, check out its updated version, called ""Safecracker: The Ultimate Puzzle Adventurer."" Same general premise, but it works on newer machines."
3,challenging,"Figuring out the puzzles in Safecracker (or rather, codes) is a pretty challenging thing to do. Puzzle games have been around for years, and I think this is probably one of the better ones. Don't be alarmed by my 3-star rating; the game is okay. I just can't play a puzzle game for longer than an hour without having to take a break. They can really wear you down."
4,another lovano gem,"mr. lovano gives us a chamber piece here, coupled with the outstanding rhythm section of elvin jones and doug holland. together they explore various forms (blues, ballads, burn outs, etc.) with great aplomb. the solos are marvelous and mr. jones and mr. holland simply get better as years go by. highlights on this album are the quiet somnolence of 'sanctuary park,' the quirky bop of 'eternal joy,' and the wonderful interplay of '4 on the floor.' this is a great introduction to mr. lovano, an artist who continues to develop and deepen with time (check out his latest release with his nonet)."
3,cute but very painful to walk in,I love them they are very cute. I love the heel but they will make your ankles and feet hurt really bad in a very short period of wear. I would recommend them for sitting around but do not expect to go to a club and dance in them. I tried and it was a bad idea. Even with 6 alcoholic beverages I could still feel my poor feet in pain.
1,Not compatible with all DVD players,"This is a duplicated DVD-R, not factory replicated. The original factory replicated DVD of highest quality is on Amazon hereAmerican Journey Vol. 2 - Dreaming Nevada"
5,Well-researched and well-written,"Since I read, on 7 Dec 1969, Professor Carter's masterful Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South I have since this book was published in 1995 wanted to read it. It tells well the story of George Wallace, four-times governor of Alabama, and his time, and is well footnoted with a good bibliography. It is disturbing that as recently as 1972 a blatantly racist message could resonate so powerfully not only in Alabama but in other states as well. A few years ago the ban on miscegenation which was in the Alabama Constitution was repealed by the people of Alabama (tho it had been inoperative by reason of a US Supreme Court ruling long before)and I found that encouraging, but one has to fear that many of the people who so raucously supported the bigoted and corrupt regime of Wallace as recently as 1972 may not have repented. Reading this book is as sobering as thinking about the fact that millions in Germany as recently as 1939 supported Nazidom."
2,Carter equates Wallace's racism with all his social views.,"Carter's scholarship is superb but his writing dense. Though he correctly gauges Wallace's political import, as did other biographers before him, he wrongly equates Wallace's racism with his other political stances. Millions supported Wallace because he articulated their concerns over issues like crime, high taxes, and federal intrusion that other politicians of the time were ignoring."
4,Gerry Boyle certainly knows the people of Maine,Gerry Boyle certainly knows the people of small town Maine. His descriptions take us into the heart of many a small Maine town. His characters are my relatives and their neighbors in central Maine ... his towns are the towns I knew as a boy. It's real!
3,"Good, but not up tp par","This is a good book, although it is not as good as the rest of the books in the series. The characters are interesting and the descriptions of Maine are great (I live an hour or so from Mr. Boyle), and Jack is a fine character, but the pace is a bit slow this time. Also, Jack's wry humor isn't as much in evidence, and I think Roxanne is a lot more trouble than she's worth--dump her, Jack. I'm looking forward to COVER STORY in January."
3,Not worth the current $60 - $70 price,"My son who is 3 absolutely loved his blower. However, he was disappointed that it did not acutally blow air. Also, it is not well made. It lasted less than a year. It was worth the $25 I paid for it, but NO more. It was only worth it because of the enjoyment my son got from it."
2,Disaster,"This product is absolutely terrible, and I really was excited about it. After three days of use, the fan that blows the green confetti inside the tube stopped working, the red spiral lights on the motor stopped coming on and the fan blade quit turning, and the tube fell off. I was able to super-glue it back together. But, you shouldn't have to accept all these defects with a new, expensive toy. I would rate it as one star, but my son really enjoyed it for a little while."
3,"Cute, but not well made.","I have to agree with the other reviews I have read on this site. It is a cute toy, but not well made. It works sometimes and then not others. My son also dropped it and the nozzle part broke off and can not be fixed. I found the beads inside to be dangerous. I have it duct taped back on. It is also very loud. It would be a great toy if it were more durable."
4,"Close to ""Real""!","This leaf blower is just about as real as it gets!It doesn't produce any air, which may turn OUR toddlers off.In the house, it's defininely a hit. But as it is loud, it belongs OUTSIDE!But, as we haven't tried it outside yet, I'm afraid it might lose it's appeal. My boys really like to HELP daddy with the yard. They currently sweep leaves and grass clippings. When their blower doesn't ""blow"", I'm afraid of how they might react.Not sure if there are any other blowers that really blow air, though.If NONE produce any air, this one is great!"
3,Great idea wish it was better made,"We just got this and my 3 year old loves it. It stopped working when we got it home so we changed the batteries. It worked better but like others, i noticed the little fan didn't always come on and blow the little yellow pellets around. I was getting ready to bring it back and exchange it for another when my 3 yr old decided to take it int he bathtub with him. now of course, it really doesn't work and has visible water inside. Might try to dry it out and see if I can still exchange it.He really loves it. It is loud but a great boy toy. We paid 19 dollars for it with a sale and coupon- don't pay much more for it"
4,FOUND A FAMILY FELON!,"I purchased two copies primarily because I am mentioned in the ""Acknowledgement"" and I had one sent to my cousin who is also a descendant of one of the counterfeiters mentioned in the book...Seth Hudson...and he is celebrating the 100th anniversary of his company. Simons' research seems very thorough and the book is a good tool for genealogical research and it is well written and easy to assimilate and a pleasant and easy read. Continued success to the writer."
1,I know you are all going to hate on me for this...,"... but oh well. I had to say something. I read this book. Honestly, I can't fathom how anyone could give this book a 5 star rating. The author obviously did his homework, it's very historically informative, but it reads like a textbook. IT'S SO BORING! The author is NOT an engaging storyteller, he would be better suited to write college textbook material. I couldn't force myself to finish this book, I was too bored. I love history and I enjoy hearing of scandals and mayhem in 17th century America, but this is the most boring book I've found. It drones on and on and doesn't really provide the excitement it promises. True stories of mayhem, it says. Ok, so since when is a lady stealing clothes out of a house mayhem? It falls short, doesn't come through, and bores to tears."
4,Brought me back to the 80's,CD was great. Too bad it took me 20+ years to buy this disc I forgot how good the old Elvis Costello music was.
5,reveiw of 'duelling languages',"This book outlines a model which explains structural constraints on codeswitching in clear language. Its strongest point is that it comes up with a theoretical framework and does not resort to ad hoc lists of constraints or take an 'anything goes' approach, but appeals to principles of language to explain bilingual discourse. This is a must-read for anyone interested in codeswitching or any other aspect of language contact and bilingualism."
1,No point,This has got to be the worst book I have ever read. I can not even begin to describe the lousy use of the english language that was used. It was impossible to follow and sputtered on into oblivion. I kept reading just to see if the author would make a point. Nope. I'm gonna ask for my money back AND compensation for my pain and suffering.
4,Not a book,This happens to be a printout on about one pack of printer paper with three holes drilled. All they do is throw it in a black 3 ring binder and put a sticker on the front (the jpeg included in the description). I'm pretty sure the pdf's are available to the public (free and legal) through an online military library.
3,An Inspiration,"The Pursuit of Hapyness is a thrilling and inspiring story. It should serve as a reminder that people can succeed in life, regardless of their history."
4,jmd.per6.,"The Pursuit of Happyness by Chris Gardner is a very good book. It was hard for me to get into it at first, but once I did, I enjoyed it. It is about a man, Chris Gardner, struggling to be abetter man. He was a single father, he was homeless, and he had no money. Finding any possible way to survive was scarce and he took everything he could. This book inspired me to be thankful and appreciate what i have. It is a great story of how Chris Gardner goes through many sacrifices to become a stock broker. He struggles to get to the top and get from rags to riches. I reccomend this book for anyone that is going through a hard life and doesn't think that they will get through it. This book is good to get peopple determined to be the best and do whatever it takes to be happy."
4,A Good Book,"I saw the movie which prompted me to read the book. As always to book was much more detailed. The language was obsene at times, but the author gave a realistic account of his life."
2,Happyness,"I definitely would not say this is the best written book I have ever read; far from it. I think he lingered too long on his abusive childhood and his sexual prowess and less on his struggle from being homeless to becoming successful. I understood his desire to be with his son, but knowing you didn't have a decent paying job and appropriate living arrangements, why would you put your child in that situation? Maybe if more explanation was given, it would have made more sense to me.I commend Chris Gardner, I just didn't like the book."
3,Inspiring and enlightening,"Abandoned as a baby by your dad,Abused as a child by your step-father,Raped as a teen by a street stranger,Jailed for failing to pay parking tickets and ousted from your home,Homeless, with no deposit, no guarantee of food, nothing to cling to but yourself and your toddler son,If you were also categorized as above-mentioned, do you think you would have the slimmest chance of success?If you don't know the answer, read this book, it'll not only give you an answer, but much much more."
1,The pursuit of Nacracissim,"An inspirational movie but an awful book.I saw the movie first, then the book ruined it. He may be good at bagging chicks and selling stocks, but Chirs Gardner's writing is dreadfully uninspiring. Even with a terrific premise like his rags-to-richs story, he was unable to inspire me with his narrative.The Chris Gardner in this book is nowhere near the man that Will Smith portrays. Hollywood has never let the truth stand in the way of making a good movie, but the movie execs outright lied when they claimed the motion picture is based on a true story. Okay, there was a own-on-his luck black man who made it in the financial Someone hand Gardner a Rubik's cube, I'd like to see that."
3,Stuck on Self,Too wordy! Ego Overage. Arrogant tones! Lacks humility. Thinking back on his interview with Oprah saying Will Smith ought to kiss his foot. Takes away from the positive pursuit of mankind. the plight over adversity. Long winded. Perhaps one could endure this story on audio cd. Even better go see the movie. Justice served.
1,The pursuit of the almighty dollar,"Mr. Gardner is an absolutely unlikable man who needlessly puts his family through hell for his own immediate satisfaction. There was no reason on earth that he had to put his child through living on the streets when he could have taken a normal job instead of pursuing a greedmongering life like being a stockbroker.There is no arguing that Mr. Gardner came from a less than desirable upbringing by a group of mostly dreadful people. Once he hits adulthood, greed and hormones override any logical sort of thinking. It's no wonder this man fit in so well with in the egocentric corporate culture of the 1980's."
3,OUTSTANDING BOOK.,"Love the book. Well written. I always love a ture ""rags to riches story"". Chris Gardner story was amazing. Another book I recommend is ""DISCOVERING TRUE WEALTH"" BY ERWIN BOGS REMPOLA -- this book is written with simplicity and sincerity, another rags to riches story but full of emotional drama at the last chapter."
3,Slow but speeds up...,This is your typical rags to riches story but definitely becomes interesting towards the end.
1,Amazing story,The book is well spread out for a autobiography. The story was amazing for one man and his son struggle to make it in life. The story was so great it had to made into a Hollywood movie.
5,question,did he really show up to that interview in his painters clothes or was that something that was only in the movie. If so how many things were stretched by hollywood and in the movie
1,Disappointing,"I wanted to read the book before watching the film. I have heard how inspirational the film is. The book should be, but is too full of excuses and bragging. When Chris Gardner eventually started to make a sucessful career for himself, he sent his son away to live with the mother who abandoned him. Not very inspirational. I would not recommend this book."
1,Not worth reading,"I usually read lot of biographies and was interested in this book because of the movie. It didn't take long time to finish reading this and after reading it, I found it was not worth reading. I agree with some other people who gave 1 star for this book. I was expecting story which was inspiring and motivating, but this book had none of those. It contains too much sexual story about author and a very little story about how he achived his life. I have been waiting for something I was expecting until the end and I couldn't find anything what I have expected from the title.I've bought this book after I have read reviews at amazon.com. I should have taken advices with 1 star reviews."
4,Great Lesson in Cause and Effect,"I only want to add that though Mr. Gardner describes fighting the odds and overcoming obstacles (many of which he laid in his own path), a very important lesson is teaching us that bad decisions lead to bad outcomes and good decisions often lead to good ones. He candidly shares the mistakes he made as well as the decisions and actions that moved him closer to success. Accepting responsibility and moving forward, rather than denying one's role and dwelling on what might have been, is the most effective method of moving onward in upward. Mr. Gardner also does and excellent job of illustrating this principle.He shows us that though nobody's perfect, with a plan, some persistence and a sense of urgency, we've all got a chance."
3,INSPIRATIONAL! Could have been better written.,"This book should be a must for all salesman. What an amazing life that made me nore motivated in my own life. However, as a book, it could have been written better. The first 150 pages could have been 75 pages. The San Fransisco segment should have been longer with more detail. Perhaps more details about being homeless. I especially appreciate his honesty when it came to sowing his oats. I am pleased that there are people in the world like his Reverend in San Francisco."
5,Very inspiring book and movie,"This is a book everyone should read. A very honest and emotional memoir, chock full of tremendous life lessons that everyone could be encouraged by. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a pick me up from the everday struggles of life."
4,I read the book before I saw the movie...,"...and I couldn't put it down.They tell you on the dust cover that it's a memoir of one man's journey from homelessness to prosperity. But it's a page-turner, how he got to that point of beginning. Chris Gardner bares it all, and had me crying and laughing out loud all on the same page.It's an amazing rag-to-riches story of determination and focus to overcome all odds."
4,Pursuit of Happyness,"The book is nothing like the movie. The book was well written. However, Chris Gardner has internal conflict. Money seemed to be his driving factors, not his family."
3,"Three stars only for being articulate, and a good writer","I'm sorry, this book did not move me. The movie was amazing!! and that is what moved me to buy the book, but after reading, and shifting through pages, the book painted a totally different picture of his situation that the movie. During the movie, I cried, cried and cried, but reading the book, I actually no longer felt sorry for Chris Gardner, and saw him as being very irresponible! He had too much pride to ask one of the many women he was sleeping with to help him temporarily with his son? he'd rather live in a subway station restroom for two weeks, when he actually had money saved up? He said that he was trying to hold onto his money, and living in the restroom was more convenient, WTF????I don't know what to say...Wow..."
4,Inspiration and touching story,"Bought this book and didnt regret it..provides further insights in chris gardner that the movie didnt include..on personal basis i still prefer the movie over book and this true story proves that determination,faith and refusal to give up despite setbacks wins the day."
1,mistake,"I haven't received yet the item and that's whay I have been trying to contact you many times by phone without any answer.Please let me know what I have to do in order to receive my item.Thanks a lot.Kind regards,Enrica Scaparone"
4,The Pursuit of Happyness is a good read.,This is a good read and an inspiring life story that inspired the major motion picture with Will Smith.
4,Fascinating read,"A fascinating tale of the American dream realized. One of the few that I couldn't put down until I had finished it. Too many vulgar words for my preference, but they were in context with the story."
2,too much unnecessary sex stories,"The theme of the book is excellent....but the sexual stories added nothing to it. In fact, these overshadowed the real meaning of success.What does this say to the readers to form their morals????"
2,"If you like the movie, don't read the book...","I loved the grace and dignity which Will Smith portrayed in the movie, so I was inspired to read the book. To my dismay, the real Chris Gardner writes with anger, some of which revealed his pettiness, especially surrounding perceived racial issues. I am a minority who has overcome many challenges. While I applaud Gardner's mental strength and perseverance, I was disappointed that the real Gardner was cocky and brassy, lacking humility in situations which were enacted poignantly in the movie. By the way, Gardner reveals way too much information about his sexual life. If you want a good pick-me-up, buy the DVD and skip the book. Thank you."
1,Move was Great! Book was a BIG disappointment,"After seeing the film and joining in the chorus of those who were inspired by the story of his life, Chris' book was such a disappointment. At the end of the book I kept wondering if he ever learned from his mistakes, if he still sleeps around, if he still does drugs, if he is still violent with other people. I was hoping to recommend this book to my employees (in the brokerage business), but it is filled with one sexual exploit (in great detail) after another. The movie role model was a terrific image of who a man should/could be. The real man in the book is no role model. Watch the movie, skip the book"
1,"Healthy ego, for sure","My husband met Mr. Gardner when he was a keynote speaker at a corporate event. He was so impressed by this man's story and the way he tells it. He bought the book at the event, got an autograph, and ended up bumping into him and speaking to him later, in another city. He is a huge admirer of Chris Gardner, and rightly so. But all the things he has said about him/his speaking, and the movie, do not match most of this book! I was on page 200 and wondering when he would stop complaining or bragging (especially bragging) and get to the crux of the story. After reading about yet another public sexcapade in an airport baggage claim area, I put it down and haven't gone back. His story is inspiring; he has overcome much, but the book dwells too much and too long either on things that were out of his control, or that I simply do not want to read about. I wish him well and I'm glad he has done extremely well, but I would not recommend this book."
5,An uplifting story,"This is an excellent book. After seeing the recent movie, I went straight to Amazon.com to get the written version. You will not be disappointed! Fast Delivery!"
1,Disappointed,"I thought this book would've been an inspirational read, but I couldn't get past the second page because of the profanity.I wouldn't reccomend reading or letting your children read this book unless you want them to pick up some colorful language.I would give 0 stars but that was not an option."
1,The Pursuit of Arrogance,"Simply put, this book is the drivel of a man who thinks very highly of himself. It's like being forced to have dinner with your egotistical, drunken uncle. ""Blah blah blah... And then I saved the world and looked good doing it.... Blah blah blah... AREN'T I GREAT?!?!"""
3,Better at the end,1) Part 1 was long and difficult to endure. Happyness was the name of the child care center that he had to take Chris Jr. too when he was working at his first job -- it had nothing to do with spelling this incorrectly.2) The book began as a whirlwind of repetitive quotes and hard to follow stories at the beginning. The story telling confused me until Part 2 of the book when he enlists in the Navy.3) The ending (Part 3) is wonderful and was worth the wait just hearing what he did. Very inspirational and touching but I had to force myself to get to that point during the torture of going through part 1
3,He made his own bed and had to lay in it,"The first half of the book was very interesting. It talked about his life as a child and gave a really good insight as to how poor people lived. He took his experiences from his childhood and ""supposedly"" used them to become successful. However, it was his own decisions and mistakes that put him into the homeless/single dad situation. He dragged his feet when he had a chance to get a good education; He cheated on his wife; He did not appear to make any real effort to find his son; Then he pawned his son off to the mother for a few months so that he could reach his own personal goals. He is a smart, savvy guy who would have been successful even if he did not screw himself up."
3,The Pursuit of Happyness,"While I would recommend this book, I was expecting a more detailed story of his life as stockbroker. Chris Gardner's story is certainly motivational and serves as a reminder that with persistence and sound morals and choices you can make ""IT"" and make a difference.A nice story compounded by the reference to giving back.John Larkin"
4,Pursuit of Happyness,"My book group read this book and then we'll see the DVD. I haven't seen the DVD yet.I thought the book was inspiring.I also thought it was a tribute to the power of a boy learning to read. His mother told him, "" a library is a dangerous place."" Mr. Gardner could not have achieved the success that he did had he not been able to read clearly and learn.I don't know if my children will have as much inspiration from me as he did from his mother. I can only hope so. I found it to be a little bit like the book ""Hope in things unseen.""Overall I enjoyed the book and think that Mr. Garnder's story is one that should inspire others. Stock brokers aren't usually held up as success stories, but your chances are a heck of a lot better than being a pro sports player or musician, so it's good to have some business-oriented role models."
1,Don't Listen to This With Little Ears Around,"I was inspired by the movie and thought that the audio book would be even better. Within minutes, I had to turn it off because my children were in the car with me. They always are with me in the car, which is the only time that I have to listen to audio books. I understand that this is a true story, but the horrible circumstances could be conveyed without the repetitive foul language. After disc one, I had to get rid of it. I truly wanted to hear the whole story, but I will not suffer the trash talk any longer. Call me a snob if you want, but it is what it is."
4,"Good movie, even better book.","I orginally saw the movie in the theaters and immediately wanted to indulge in the book therafter. Well, time has gotten away from me, and I finally picked up the book that I had purchased many months ago and read it straight through in two days.This book is VERY inspiring as it shows that no matter what background or social situation you come from, you can conquer and do ANYTHING you want in life.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has big dreams of doing something incredibly with their lives, and anyone who wants to read a truly moving piece of literature."
1,Not as good as the movie,"After being inspired by the movie, I was disappointed with the actual book, which is quite different from the movie. It focuses a lot on the years before Chris became a father--including many (more than necessary) descriptions of his sexual exploits, drug use, etc...ultimately proving Chris to be less of a hero than was portrayed by Will Smith. Didn't leave me with the heartwarming feeling that the movie did."
3,Not similar to the movie,"I got this book after watching the movie, but the movie is nicer because the book gets too much deep in the childhood of Chris which in some places is repeating it self. what a motivational topic go for the movie."
1,Watch the movie instead,After I saw the movie I wanted to learn more about his life so I bought the book. Bad idea. I really wanted to like this book. I think there were a lot of things that could have been edited out. I don't think he always presented himself in the best light. It's okay to show your faults but there were times when he seemed to be almost bragging about the things he did. I stuck with it for many of his less than perfect behavior but when he started talking in detail about cheating on his wife for the second time I could not keep reading. By that point I really had little sympathy for him.
3,Not as good as the movie,"I saw the movie and loved the story.This made me uneasy going into the book. The movie made Gardner to be an American hero, moving up from homelessness into riches. The full story as Gardner tells it is much more grim.I won't itemize Gardner's list of crimes, but it's enough to say, I think, that the movie omits or glosses over most of the shadier events of his life.And, no, as you might expect, even with a writer helping him, Gardner is not good at setting down the story of his life.I was left with the feeling that Gardner is just a man who wanted to become rich and did so. His greatest accomplishment was to do this without tossing aside his kids when it would have been easy to do so."
3,Needs a mechanical engineer or mechanical designer,"I have used this system for 3 years now and although the concept is good, it needs more design work. The rear mounted bottle does not mount well to the seat and the tube up front is difficult to mount to the handle bars because all they use is Velcro and a rubber mount. The big problem is the feeding tube which has an internal positioning wire which is contained by cloth. The wire always breaks through the cloth. When the wire breaks through the cloth it will hit you in the mouth and make precision positioning of the mouth piece almost impossible. Nice Idea bad execution. For Triathletes this still may the best system because you can have some one refill the bottle in the back without stopping but for everyone else I recommend Sip Stream Rider Sports Innovation which can be bought directly from their website but is no longer available through Amazon. Never reach should study how they handle the tube positioning: its much better."
5,Piece of American History,"This is the story of Democratic machine politics in Boston. Really a profile of former mayor of that city and Governor of Mass. And another John Ford masterpiece on a small scale. If you liked the Last Hurrah, you're sure to embrace Ford's, The Quiet Man."
5,The Greatest Record Of The 90's,"tripping daisy explodes into lyrical fantasy and sonic splendor on this release, the catchyness of all the songs and their individual uniqueness lends your brain to the wide open world of daydreams galore. take a trip, and you'll be back for more."
2,Product does not match picture,"I was searching specifically for the Sabre Jogger product (with the handle/clip for carrying). The product I received today is not the product in the picture. It is the same basic unit, except it has a metal pocket clip, NOT the hand strap shown in the picture. In reading the product description, it appears that the product is indeed the one with the pocket clip, NOT the strap. Someone should update the picture to be the correct one. It is not worth returning, I will just find a local retailer and purchase the product I intended to buy."
3,Used it and not impressed,"I bought this from another place and not on here. I used this tonight on a guy who was drunk and high on pot and probably meth. I dont recommend the twist and press this has. It jammed 3 times during the almost complete empty of this. It worked ok for the guy being high, but i had to resort to a torque wrench instead when it stopped being effective. I have a larger flip top version of this and it is much easier and faster to use. It shot a decent stream at about 10 feet. No blow back onto my face but i dont know which direction the wind was blowing either.Overall the spray is good. I just dont like and am not comfortable with how you use it. My opinion, get the flip top."
5,Basic unit,"I ordered this unit because it is the basic insert, with no bulky keychain carrier, or bells and whistles. I have not had to use it, but I did a test spray and it worked just fine. The safety feature seems to be a good balance between ease of use, and preventing an accident. A little sniff will clear your sinuses right out, btw."
2,jogger spray may work,"We haven't, fortunately, had to use the defensive spray. However, the ""trigger"" has very simple on/off positions, but there is not a ""safety"" feature that allows one to store or carry the device such that inadvertent movement may activate it. The on/off feature is nice so that if you are carrying the device in your hand when you job and are attacked, you can easily use the spray. However, my wife has tried carrying it in a purse, and it shifted inadvertently to the ""on"" position. There is a real potential to accidental spray yourself. This is a design flaw."
1,unsafe for your laptop,"I bought one of these and the stitching around the zipper that is meant to hold the laptop came apart within a few uses. Amazon replaced the bag, and the same thing happened in the same spot within a couple days of using it. Particularly troublesome, because it could happen and expose your laptop while the backpack is on your back, to the point it could fall out or be stolen. After reading the other review, it's clear this is a defective design."
2,Exploring Horizons - Spirit of the Klondike.,I was disappointed with this DVD. It had little information on thehistory of Dawson Ciy or the Klondike itself.It concentrated to muchtime on talking about and showing ultra lite aircraft flying around thearea.H pattern
5,Ryanhood Rocks,"I discovered Ryanhood while visiting my family in Tucson. Ryanhood is based in Tucson. These guys really have heart and soul. The music is peaceful, and the lyrics are sweet. I highly recommend them if you like Simon and Garfunkel."
1,horrible,"As far as effectiveness, I can't comment because I've only used encare once but my husband experience painful burning of the penis and even the day after using encare sex is painful for me. It makes the inside of the vagina feel dry and on fire. If you have sensetive skin I wouldn't reccomend."
4,They Love It!,"My boys really wanted this game, but after reading the reviews here, I tried to talk them out of it, but they LOVE the show so really wanted to get the game. We bought it here and they LOVE the game! My boys are 8,9 & 10, and really enjoy games that are fun and silly. The only real bummer is that it is only a 1 player game- it would be perfect if it were a multi-player."
4,"A very welcoming title to the Ed Edd n Eddy series, but there are a few flaws worth noting.","Ed Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures is a very fun platform game.There are multiple levels that you play in the game, and in each on you play as either Ed, Edd or Eddy. Each of the Eds has his own abilities that can be used in various ways.This game is a very welcoming title to the Ed Edd n Eddy franchise.However, there are multiple flaws about this game that are worth noting.1) The game too short overall.There are about 6 levels or so, and each one takes about 20-30 minutes to complete.2) The animated cut-scenes are poorly made compared to the actual TV show.3) The challenges in the game can be too easy at times.4) Some of the gameplay elements can be somewhat repetitive every now and then.5) There really isn't much (if anything at all) to do after completing the game.But the un-animated cut-scenes are very well constructed, the voice acting is perfect, and the plot for each level is well written."
4,Good,This game is very creative and is pretty kool so bottom line get this game if yr child is 5-10 years old.
3,Wired game,Ok i brought the game becuse i like the tv show but the graphics were relly wired and game play the game is fun and boring at times but over all wired!Toy can control 3 edds and go on humors missions fun gAME BUT RENT IT BEFOR BUYING IT.p.s.Should be e10+ it contains vilonice and crude humor
3,Not quite what you were looking for,"I love the music from the USA release of the Neverending Story, particularly the Ivory Tower and Bastian's Happy Flight. The music in the movie was uplifting and exciting. Sadly, the music as translated to the official soundtrack release is not quite what you would expect. Tracks 2 through 5, all the Giorgio Moroder tracks, were messed around with in the studio and have had cheesy synth ""drumbeat"" added to them. The beat completely ruins the enchanting harmony of Ivory Tower and the other 4 tracks don't fare much better. Fortunately the opening theme song and the Klaus Doldinger tracks are intact just as you remember them from the film. I've been waiting for a re-release of this soundtrack with the Moroder tracks corrected for decades and at this point it will probably never happen short of a score-only audio track on a future Blu Ray disc. Until that time, this soundtrack is what you'll have to live with."
4,"the book, better than the movie","I have to say that just from reading the reviews, the book sounds much more interesting than the movie version that was released in 2004 on the ""OXYGEN"" network."
4,Flannel intro,"14 quilt patterns, relying mostly on simple pieced shapes. Personnal 3 favorites that I will -probably! - do : 1) Homespun Pleasures : 54-40 or Fight blocks alternating with Courthouse Steps 2) Buzz Saw 3) The Diamond Four-Patch. p.s.: check the supremely comfy B+W cat on the Log Cabin page 33 !"
1,Stack-n-Whack,It is an easy step by step direction of how to make interesting quilts. They give ideas on what type of material to buy
4,Great Service,"The book was received in a very timely manner and was in very good condition for being a ""used"" book. I was making a stack and wack with my quilt guild and could not have made it without the book."
2,Confusing Text,"The book came in perfect condition in a timely matter. Amazon did great! However, the author made the directions so confusing the book was useless to me. I shared it with several other long time quilters and they didn't do any better than I. I definately would NOT purchase it again."
3,Magic Stack-N-Whack Quilts,"I checked this book out of the library several times and was unable to make a quilt from the book. Just could not understand the process.I took a class where this book was used and now find the book great. After I started the class I purchased the book from Amazon. I am sure I will be making more quilts from this book, as Stack-N-Whack is just a great deal of fun now that I understand how to use the book."
5,Magic Stack and Whack quilt,"Great book with very detailed explanation of steps to accomplish this fun quilt. A ""Must Have"" in my sewing library!"
5,Quality of service,"I am very pleased with the book, but really amazed at the service I received. The book is written and illustrated in a way that I think I can make this quilt without getting additional instruction elsewhere. The following is a copy of my response to Wanda Myron on August 9, the person I bought this book from.Marie Rock wrote:WOW!!!!!I tried to leave a feedback on www. amazon.com/feedback, but, being computer challenged, I couldn't make it work.I would have left a rating of 10, or settled for 5 as that was as high as I could go.I ordered my book Saturday morning and it was delivered this morning, Monday. Less than 48 hours, including Sunday; 2 days!!!! My confirmation stated that it would be delivered by August 30, which was, OK. But 2 days?????Fortunately, I am better at quilting than computers, so I know I'll enjoy my book. Can you forward this review to Amazon?Thanks so much for the spectacular service!Marie Rock"
4,time will tell,"I have read this book twice now since I received it. I purchased it as a result of watching HGTV, and shortly thereafter became aware that there was a class to be held on this technique and this book was required. Hence, I bought it.as mentioned, I read it twice, and the first time I was not completely clear as to how to do it. But the second reading brought me closer. I found the book to be helpful, I understood what I was going to be doing, however, I found that their description of the types of material needed to get the best results was difficult to understand. I am still pondering over the suggestions made, and with my visits to the material store, I am still not sure I could make a good purchase.But I can say the book and its illustrations are enough to make my want to pursue this further. I am looking forward to the class, and I am sure once I get there and the 'experts' take over, what I have read will become clear."
4,Stack and Whack book,"This book is good if you are not a beginning sewer. It has wonderful colorful pictures of finished products and good instructions. This is not an easy technique to master on your own but results are amazing once you figure it out, perhaps with the help of a teacher and the book as reference. Several different patterns in the book keep a person busy for many hours quilting this style."
4,A thoroughly delightful book,"I have to disagree with Alan Foster's comments about ""Glorie"". I felt that it was enchanting, and if not a laugh a page, at least a smile. So many insights into the thinking of an older person. Glorie reminds me of Sophia on ""Golden Girls"", only with a lighter touch. As for Jack speaking directly to her, I believe it's a given that it is done just in Glorie's thoughts, and he didn't show up on command. I had wondered how it would all end, and I think it did in the only way that would have been plausible. I highly recommend this book to one and all."
5,The best in the world,"5 stars for the fact that this DVD has his actual WCW theme. Great matches and moments, plenty of early Jericho, must buy for wwe,wwf,wcw,Jericho, and wrestling fans"
5,Breaking The Code Review,"If reading two great books by this man isn't your walk in the park, then I recommend you buy this DVD. It shows everything in the books and much much more. The movie was entertaining and a must have for all Jericho wannabes!"
5,Saying it loud and keeping it real,An excellent new album by a musician who has found an innovative and original voice in the era of backwards-looking jazz. The album's extreme creativity that at once remains firmly steeped in the tradition of radical black music essentially makes jazz and funk once again relevant. Don Byron and Existential Dred keep it real.
1,Just does not work for me,"I applaud risk taking and innovation, and the idea of this album sounds great. However, the proof is in the listening, and from that standpoint this album leaves me cold. The social and political commentary is delivered in a condescending, smug attitude which I find disrespectful of the intelligent listener. The funk and jazz elements just do not come together in a compelling way. Must we listen to Byron eat celery while he talks--that's not cool, just bad table manners no matter if you are doing it on a hip, aware disc or not. The spoken word parts are indulgent in the extreme--who wants to hear this rather obvious pontificating more than once. This disc just does not make it, and I had hoped that it would when I heard the description."
1,Very disappointing,"I bought this CD hoping to hear some great clarinet playing by Don Byron. Unfortunately, the clarinet is rarely heard. Some of tracks are pure talking with no musical accompliment whatsoever."
2,Too firm for my neck and head,The pillow was just too firm for my comfort. Also the depression in the middle was too far down. I put a small pillow in that spot and it did better.
1,hard as a rock,I got this to help with neck and back pain. This should be for Fred Flinstone b/c I kid you not it is hard as a rock And dosent fit neck properly at all. Should of bought the $40 pillow from the chiropractor. I guess its true you get what you pay for. I called Amazon to return and they were nice enough to fully refund me.
1,Pillow is too large and too thick.,The pillow is too large and too thick. I had woken up one morning with neck pain from sleeping wrong. I decided to purchase a pillow with a neck support based on the reviews and recommendation from my chiropractor. When this came I couldn't even lay on it for 30 seconds before my neck was hurting. I returned the pillow.
2,Not for me,"In defense of the pillow, these items depend on the people using them and this marriage was not made in heaven. It was just to hard for me. It looked like it had potential and for some users, it might be a dream product, but it sent it to Goodwill after two uncomfortable nights. Rock Hard."
5,Good for Neck Support,"This pillow is the most comfortable pillow I have ever slept on. Unlike most support pillows, this pillow is soft, not hard and stiff. Initially, I suffered from headaches and neck and back pain when waking up in the morning. This pillow has solved all of those problems and I am no longer really tired when waking up from what's supposed to be a full night's sleep.$20 is kind of much for a pillow, but after my experience of feeling rested and no pain, this pillow is worth every penny."
4,I like it,I really like this pillow - I think it's helping me sleep better as I was having trouble with not being able to breathe well at night. I am sleeping better now.
2,Cream Puff Pillow!,"I have used the stress ease pillow support for several months and, while it was fine in the beginning, it is now apparent that the cervical support area has quickly weakened with use. I am one who needs more substantial neck support and, because of that, I would not buy this pillow again. TheDuro-Med Full Size 3-Zone Cervical Comfort Pillowneeds breaking in but was a much better choice for me to use. ~ Mrs. B."
2,Not so great for short necked people,"I had high hopes for this pillow but it didn't work out. The part that is supposed to support the neck is too wide for me. It ends up putting my neck in an awful twist. I'm sure if my neck were longer, it would be a great product. It also pushed my ear lobe up into a quite unpleasant position. I can't be too upset though. The pillow was priced right. On the up side, the pillow was cool and didn't cause me to overheat like memory foam pillows have."
1,Not good,"This pillow was very weird to sleep on. It had to much stuffing on the edges for my head to be able to rest in the middle, however my fianc√© didnt think it was too bad."
4,good pillow but too hard for me,For the price this is a very nice pillow. Unfortunately it was a little too hard for me so I sent it back. I also have a foam cervical pillow so it appears that I like the foam material better. If you don't mind a harder pillow I think it will work as intended.
1,Way too firm,"This pillow was well constructed, but way too hard. The outer rolls were a bit too big for my head to clear them and end up in the concaved center. The outer rolls were so firm that it actually hurt my cheeks when I laid on my side. I can't use this pillow."
2,wasn't crazy about it,"I'm on a never ending quest to find the perfect pillow. For me, this one wasn't it. I tend to wake up with neck pain, and this pillow wasn't the solution."
3,"Pillow is ok, but a bit stiff",At first I really liked the pillow but I have noticed that it is pretty stiff and I prefer softer pillows.
5,A great book,My 6 year old loves this book. We have read it through several times and he still asks to hear some of his favorite stories from the book again. This is exactly what we look for in a read-aloud book.
1,This in NOT original Giovanni music,"If you want original Giovanni music, do not buy this bootleg version that was re-mixed using other musicians and sold as Giovanni original music. If it is not NewCastle Records, it is NOT Giovanni's music. To find original Giovanni cds and dvds, go to his official website www dot giovanni dot com There, you will find all of Giovanni's latest releases for special discounted prices."
5,Quietude by Giovanni,"My first copy of this CD was a gift in 1996. Over the years, I wore the copy out and recently replaced it. I start my day off listening to this. I love this CD and think it helps my day start out right. I particularly like the selection of music - very nice! This piano audio is very soothing and cheerful to listen to. Quietude by Giovanni - Friends & Lovers."
4,an introduction to an interesting subject,"--The first part of the book is devoted to quite hard chapters on transitive, arc-transitive graph, homomorphism, etc.--The second part is about Matrix theory, interlacing, strongly regular graph, two graph, generalized line graph, etc it is the main part of the book.--The third part is about cut, flows, Knots, etc.This book can serve as a nice introduction to the subject of Graph theory.Nevertheless:--This book lacks some more example, for this see ""distance regular graph"".--It is sketchy on chromatic polynomial, planar graph.--The original book by Norman Biggs is shorter, smarter, nicer"
3,Good Book!,I bought this book because I need to look for connections between groups and the graph complement of a graph G. The book is ok but unfottunately I did not find information about the topic I am researching.
4,Very Very Good!,"I don't feel it's her best, (for me), but it's a very good, relaxing CD. It's a little on the short side, as in her other CD's I'm already asleep before she gets halfway through! This one, I usually hear the whole thing, and then go back to my favorite of hers, 'Guided Relaxation'. I've bought so many of her tapes, and I know that there is no way that I can go wrong with any of them. Guided just happens to be my favorite. I guess I like the ratings that most people seem to put 5 stars for! I give Guided Relaxation six, and if this one was longer, I'd do the same with this one."
2,Not so guided,"The CD starts out with a monologue saying how good the CD is. The background music sometimes overwhelmes the speaker and at other times disappears all together. The speaker gives instructions for something to meditate on, and then there is a long period - sometimes too long - of music. The speaker sometimes has an echo like voice over that I found distracting. Not something I can recommend."
2,Awkward,"This is a spectacle. Slow motion car crash. It is so awkward that there is actually something compelling about it, I think, if you dig kitsch of the ambitious-but-failed and can-you-believe-they-did-this varieties. I usually don't, in music anyway, so mine is in the sell pile. A more positive way to take it is as audaciously weird and full of personality but still ridiculous. Not for anyone looking for Mozart or for Egyptian music. You will find neither here."
1,Terrible quality mouse,I am not upset that I did not receive the mouse in the picture; I am super angry about the fact that the mouse they sent is a MUCH LOWER quality toy than what is shown in the picture. I find this to be very dishonest and disrespectful to cat owners on Amazons part. I am also very saddened by the fact that my cat's are not going to receive the present that I know they would love. I HATE wasting money that I work very hard for.
4,Great for getting started!,We really enjoyed this book as we taught our lab how to catch and return a frisbee. The book is fairly concise and has quite a few practical tips to encourage your dog to perform the tricks. The author uses some entertaining examples to illustrate his points. We found it to be a great introduction to learning to play frisbee with our dog.
1,Hip luxation,Dogs jumping risk hip luxation. Mine required surgery to put his femur back into his hip socket following a bad landing. Do not risk this with your dog.
2,very outdated and didn't help me,"the book is from the 70's and the images and text show it. the images are barely visible because the print quality is so low.it had only one chapter that was useful to me. overall, i would not recommend it. what i want is a book like this one:101 Dog Tricks: Step by Step Activities to Engage, Challenge, and Bond with Your Dogbut for frisbees."
3,Robert Goulet CD,"This CD is ok, but I have heard him sing some better renditions of some of these songs. All in all, it was worth buying."
3,Just okay,"I purchased these gloves to use for a cardio-bag workout. First thing I noticed with this type of glove is that there is no protection at all. I did not plan on killing a heavy-bag, but I did expect some type of protection for the knuckles. There is a little foam in there but no more than wearing a sock on your hands.I gave these gloves to my wife who wears a set of wraps and uses cloth inserts to do her cardio workout with them. I moved on to bigger and better gloves and would recommend you do the same."
2,Quality is questionable- Don't expect them to last long,"I purchased these gloves and had about three 20 minute sessions on my heavy bag with them. While I feel that they are comfortable and offer adequate protection, the quality/durability is questionable. After only 2 sessions, I noticed separation/tearing of the sewn seams on both gloves in the thumb webbing area. The tears are about a half of an inch now, but I know that they will continue to separate with continued use, eventually becoming useless. My hands are not abnormally large, thus I have no idea why they began to deteriorate so quickly. For the price, I would have expected them to last longer than a few heavy bag sessions. Replacing these every month would be far more expensive that finding a set that would last. Now I need to find a pair of quality bag gloves that will last, presumably leather, even if it means paying a premium to acquire them."
5,Great amateur boxing gloves!,My son uses these everyday on his 75pound bag. He loves them and so far they've held up great!
2,Product = Nice Service = Un-focused,"I ordered these gloves because they seemed quality and the company had good reviews, and I was ecstatic when the product arrived a day early...but they sent me TWO right hand gloves; no left hand glove. I have no idea how they expect me to use two right hand gloves...I need an actual pair of gloves. If they act responsiblity and promptly send me the correct merchandise, maybe I could look past the lack of focus in shipping...the gloves themselves seem of good quality. This makes the fact that I can't use them even worse!Roll the die and and buy!"
5,The Best Training gloves Ever!,i Got these Training Gloves as a gift from my Brother! to use for Kick Boxing & they Work Great not Only are they Really Soft but they won't hurt your hands! if you are a boxer or A Kick Boxer then you should Get Tko Training Gloves!:)
2,"Cute toy, not new condition","I ordered this beanie baby since my daughter loves cat beanies. When it arrived, it had a tag which was bent, dirty, and worn. It's fur was not bright white, and it actually had pieces of crumbs and dirt embedded in it. It was clearly not new...disappointing since it was a cute animal."
4,Correction,"Hate to tell you Kerry, but as much as you love the writing, McDonagh is a he, not a she! Hard to believe a guy can write such convincing women, huh?"
5,McDonagh's characterizations create a superb reality.,"McDonagh has created in her plays, a poignantly real and bitingly humerous reality. Her characters are so true that it is easy to forget that we are not right there in the small Irish house with Mag and Maureen. Extraordinarily performed on Broadway, ""The Beauty Queen of Leenane"" is certainly a far superior production to the ridiculously star studded ART!"
1,Peasant chic.,"Who would have believed that this absurd melodrama would have garnered such critical plaudits? It's reads like Psycho meets Darby O'Gill. No one in Ireland talks like the people in this play ""do be talking"". Utterly offensive nonsense."
4,As Good as Behane,"I'm a big fan of Martin McDonagh's movies (IN BRUGES, SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS), but didn't realize he was a playwright until someone pointed me to this book. After reading it, I'm now just as big a fan of his plays as I am of his films. The three plays featured in TBQOL are interconnected and focus on the locals in the titular town. What appear on the surface to be funny slices of life turn out to be a whole lot more and, as he does in his movies, McDonagh steers the comedy into dark, violent territory. I loved each one of these plays equally and will certainly be seeking out more of his work, whatever the medium."
5,AMAZING!,"With this book Hinnrichs covers a broad range of subjects having to do with film as an art form and how the two relate. If you aren't going to buy the book for the subject matter, buy it because Bruce Hinnrichs is a cool guy. He teaches my film class and is no nonsense kind of guy. He speaks his mind and is an entertaining speaker. Of course, he doesn't like Star Wars, but I'll let that pass...To conclude, this has a couple of lists of domestic and foregn reccommend films and is a great list if you are looking for good movies, most of which you may have not heard of. Later!"
3,Singing bird clock,"As a member of the Audubon Society,I liked the idea of this clock and was particularly pleased by the fact that it had a sensor that prevented it from 'singing' all night long. However, I have a hyper dog and cat that went nuts when the birds started singing so I can't recommend it for a home with that type of situation. Other than that it is a high quality clock. However, I would have liked to have had a mourning dove included in the repertoire of bird songs. I might add that I had considerable difficulty trying to return this item so think carefully before you order it in the event that you might want to return for any reason."
5,Singing Bird Clock,The company sent us a second clock because the first clock arrived with a broken glass and hands. This was ordered because we had an original singing bird clock and it fell off the wall and broke several months ago and we needed to replace it. Barbara E. Powell
5,This Clock Keeps My Apartment Sounding Like The Outdoors,I love listening to the Bird sounds. Especially when they are not allowed in my apartment. This clock makes up for that!
4,I enjoy this clock and the bird calls that keep me company every day,"I like this clock but if I had to suggest an improvement it would be that the volume of the calls would be just a touch higher. Maybe I would tire of it if it were louder, but in any event, I'm satisfied with my little clock."
5,So tweety!,The Tweety spare tire cover looks great on my yellow Jeep Wrangler andeveryone that sees it loves it.
1,cheap material,"do not waste your money this is a low quality product the material is paper thin & the tweety on it looks like a cheap iron on patch, & there is no way of secureing it to your vehicle it hangs on with a lil elastic cord. terrible value for money"
2,Like Trying to Find the Northwest Passage,"Ok, Vollmann is brilliant, a genius. One has to give it to him with this and his other huge tomes in which he goes full-tilt in an attempt at literary greatness, and his passages are often riveting.The book tries to out-do ULYSSES. It does. But finally, around the 400th page, who cares?"
4,Great shooting glasses,"After using regular sunglasses for over a year on a skeet field I bought these to open up my view of the field because I was noticing that my sunglasses were affecting my peripheral view side-to-side and up-to-down. Using these the very first time I noticed how much more I can see than with just my regular sunglasses. My view of the field has increased dramatically which has really helped my scores. The glasses are lightweight, fit very well - even on a wide face. They are actually very comfortable to wear. The yellow color of the lens enhances orange colors which helps make the clay pigeons stand out. Overall, these are very nice glasses and I would recommend them. Great price.I did not give the 5th star because 1) they should include a simple cloth, drawstring case, and 2) the lens color is yellow and not amber. The lens color is as pictured so don't expect more amber then you see."
2,Decent,"These are decent yet uncomfortable if you wear electronic ear protection. The cups from non ear plug hearing protection will press against the wire frame that wraps around your ears. I will have to try another brand/model/style, these are just too painful for extended periods of time when doubling up with hearing protection."
5,LOVE THESE,super comfortable and the best best best shooting glasses. I even wear these just to hang around outside lol. They help me see better :)
5,Inexpensively AWESOME,"Prior to buying these glasses, I looked everywhere for cycling glasses (bicycling) that would sheild my eyes from bugs, but also not fog up on me. These did the trick. The key is the lenses sit far enough off your face that your own breath or humidity doesn't get trapped on the inside of the lense....its that simple. I've only had 'em for 1 month or 6-8 rides, but so far but they seem to be durable as well."
3,Ok.,"These glasses are just ok. They seem to fit well and I don't really notice any sort of distortion. The problem is using them in combination with muff style hearing protection. By the end of a shooting session, the part of the frame that is behind your ears seem to really dig in. The frame also seems to keep the padding of the muffs off just enough to make them not as protective as they should be.Great for a back up pair or without muff style ear protection..."
3,They are what they say they are,"I got these thinking they'd be good glasses for shooting, as in hunting. But they are just yellow safety glasses. And although they are yellow, they didn't seem to ""HD"" anything to me. But they are durable and comfortable, so grab these if all u need are some safety glasses."
4,I like 'em,"These glasses are comfortable, even with earmuffs on. The longest I've worn them with earmuffs is for 90 minutes, and they felt fine. I am slightly worried that the ear pieces might snap off from the lens if handled too roughly though; but even if that happens, I'd still strongly consider getting the same pair again."
3,Bought for the hubby,I purchased this for my husband as a gift some time ago. He likes it but doesn't usually use it... It just sits in the cabinet most of the time...
5,The best story I've ever read.,"I first read these books in 5th grade. It is by far the best set I have ever read. Although I can now recite most of the story from memory I still reread the Chronicles at least once a year, if not more. A true literary treasure to be enjoyed by all ages."
2,Fake book,This book was in a most disappointng condion. I thought the book was 80 years old instead of 25 years old. This book is going into the trash.
4,smarter (and better) than the average bar band,"I had the pleasure of watching the Slugs, one of the hardest working bands in Chicago, many times while I lived there years ago. now miles away, hearing their new disc brought back many great old times and reminded me just how fine this band is. ""Junior"" furthers their pop-rock style that draws most clearly from the 'Mats, XTC and NRBQ. like those bands, the Slugs are clever and have a great sense of melody. Dag Juhlin, who had a stint with Poi Dog, is a terrific songwriter. think of the Slugs as Chicago's anti-Smashing Pumpkins: an unpretentious, witty rock'n'roll party band with tunes and personality."
1,It was awful,"I had high hopes for this book considering the reviews but the book was simply awful. The author tried to imitate the simple and endearing voices of a great YA authors (C.S. Lewis, L'Engle, Boston, Enright) but failed. Maybe Ms. Birdsall should observe more children before writing a children's book as her characters certainly did not act like real children or even characters deserving of sympathy. I feel very resentful that this book wasted my time. The only part of the book I enjoyed was the cover art. It certainly did not deserve to win the National Book Award."
1,Intensely boring,"Finally got around to reading this book, and while it's better than anything I've ever had published, it certainly does suck the life force from one, doesn't it? I kept turning the pages--- after all, a National Book Award and all---- yet on each new page a canvass of nothing is painted with a palette of low-affect dialogue exchanges and sight words. Dreadful. I don't know who these people are, gushing about this book, and I see an actual young person has chimed in with some praise, but in the universe I inhabit, kids tend to like books in which something worth mentioning actually happens. Honk if you agree."
5,My daughter loved it,"Judging from my daughter, this is perfect for 9- to 12-year-old girls. She has just finished the third in the series."
4,A Winning Update of Modern Classics,"Sometimes I really wonder where Booklist and School Library Journal and Reed Elsevier get some of the people who write the Editorial Reviews that head up most of these pages. But wow, they really got it right on this book. In a few short paragraphs they reference, with approval, Elizabeth Enright, Edward Eager, Noel Streatfeild, Sydney Taylor's ""All-of-a-Kind Family"" and Maud Hart's Betsy-Tacy novels. Well, yes.The thing is, all of those other writers can feel, at some point, very dated. The appeal I find in Birdsall's book is that while the subject matter, the plot, and the over all feel of the book are very old-fashioned, the writing, the manner of expression of the characters, the descriptive prose, is very fresh and modern. I think this helps a great deal in enhancing the appeal of the book for a modern young reader. And there does seem to be some room on the bookshelf for a book that is just, well, charming."
3,It's OKAY,Not one of those books you just can't put down. Purchased this on a suggestion from amazon to people who have also purchased The Benedict SOciety. It's nothing like that :(
2,Just get real classics,"It has a fine story line. The author seems to want to present the Penderwicks as a ""good family."" Then why would she choose to use phrases like ""I'll kill you,"" ""stupid idiot"" repeatedly among the young children's conversation? It gets tiring. And as other reviewers noted, there are some things unbelievable in characters. The oldest sister Rosalind is supposed to be only 12, already caring for her 4 year old sister like an adult. I doubt if the author has her own children that age. The balance of each character's importance to the storyline seems off. It's awkward. Also, the children's behavior is often far from good and very little follow up is made. It is NOT for children and I am surprised that this book won an award at all. If you would like your children to read good old days' adventures, get true classics. Disappointing."
5,"The Penderwicks: A summer Tale of Four Sisters, Two Rabbits, and a Very Interesting Boy","The book came to me in good time and in excellent condition. I was pleased. Oh, and the price was very good, too."
5,Amme's Reviews,"WOW!!!!!!!I would totally recommend this book in a second. a good read and fascinating story plot. Rosalind, Skye,Jane,Batty,Cagney,jeffrey,and hound will leave you laughing for more!"
5,A Review for Adults Who Still Like Kids' Lit,"This book deserves all the awards it's gotten. The characterization is good, the setting is interesting, and the plot is a believable one. A very pleasant way to spend an afternoon. I look for more books about the entertaining Penderwick sisters."
4,Great book for middle school girls!,"A great book for girls! I'm going to recommend this one to all the middle school girls I know. It's just so much fun!The one thing that sort of caught me off guard, though, was that Jane's book, one of the main characters, was written on her father's computer. The rest of the book is written in sort of a ""timeless"" manner. There's no mention of anything to identify its time in history. I was sort of imagining a 1950's or 60's setting so towards the end of the book when Jane says her book is saved on her father's computer it sort of took me off guard, but not that it mattered...And I do have to agree with another commenter's post that the ages seemed a bit off for some of the characters... Batty's comments were definitely more than a four-year-old would probably make, Rosalind was too mature for a 12-year-old and Mrs. Tifton did seem MUCH older... but those things didn't ruin the story for me, just kept me from giving it five stars."
4,"A Funny, Sad, Nice Book","The four Penderwick sisters are Rosalind, Skye, Jane & Batty and their dog is named Hound. One of the exciting parts of the book is in the beginning. Batty the youngest Penderwick sister wears butterfly wings. Batty went under the gate to pick flowers and while she was picking flowers she started to sing about kangaroos. Then a bull comes out. Batty doesn't know that there is a bull. Jane started to scream. Jane screams often, so Batty knows it's Jane screaming. Then Batty looks up and sees the bull. Batty knew that the bull was not a horse. So she says to herself that she shouldn't have gone under the fence in the first place. She is wishing that Hound and her daddy were there. Jane is jumping up and down to distract the bull. Skye went under the gate and their new friend Jeffery went under the gate too. Skye went to help Batty, and Jeffery went to distract the bull. This is a book I would recommend to people who like funny, sad and nice books.By Zulma"
4,The Penderwicks--a Delightful childhood romp,"""A Summer Tale of Four Sisters, Two Rabbits, and a Very Interesting Boy"" so says the book cover. What it doesn't tell you is that the four sisters are definate individuals: Rosalind, the eldest and one that looks after the other three since their Mother has died. Skye the tomboy, Jane the romantic and Batty the youngest who runs around wearing butterfly wings and whose best friend is their dog, Hound.This story reminds one of an era long gone and sorely missed. A simpler time when one could appreciate just going out and playing a game of catch. There are no real ugly twists and turns to this story. It is a vacation for the mind to romp and play in a little cottage with a bunch of interesting friends."
5,Made in the U.S.A. and at a great price!,Great machete and made in the U.S. This is my second Ontario purchase and I am very impressed with their quality.
4,hoss,"This thing is a beast. It has a lot of weight to it; though this may be something some are afraid of, to me it means that it can wield a hefty blow to whatever you hit! It is full tang and made from good steel. The only reason, and I mean the only reason, that I did not give this machete five out of five stars is because the edge that comes on it is really poor. I had to re-profile the blade with a metal file and sharpening stone. Now it slides right through tree branches and cuts wood like a champ. The heft it has adds momentum to your chops with a trade off. Due to its weight you need to have pretty strong forearms to handle repeated use. The handle is good. I was hesitant about the handle at first but after using it my concerns abated. Some of the more ""grippy"" handles cause blisters due to the excess friction on your hand (blisters are a real concern). Even though it does not stick to the hand as much as say a kraton handle the design of this handle does prevent it sliding out of the hand."
2,Low quality steel,"Right out of the the box this needed an edge. Upon sharpening it, I found the ""steel"" is soft as crap. It will not hold an edge."
4,Machete Knife,"This knife is a good general all around user. Light enough to swing all day in light brush. Not heavy enough for anything over 1"" in dia. Great unbreakable handle."
3,a funky bassline,"You know I'm old school when I can say I owned this record and that I owned a record player period. I've forgotten whether this single or ""Good Beat"" is the one with the Deee-Lite members' head popping out of flowers, an image designed by Pierre and Gilles. ""Riding on Through"" was a non-LP cut that had a funky bassline. It could have been a single all by itself. Sometimes Deee-Lite made trash, but scavenge through and you will also learn that they made gems. ""Riding on Through"" is one of those. Even more than 15 years later, I think people could appreciate it on the dance floor. As always, Lady Miss Kier's vocals are seductive, soothing, and hyper-feminine. If you can get your hands on this, and still own a record player, you will not be disappointed. If you liked their songs ""What is Love?"" and ""Deep-Ending,"" then you will also love ""Riding."""
2,VIAAQ TITANIUM HTR Problems,"This product had problems with regulation in a small 10gal tank. When it was set to regulate to 90degs F, the actual measured temperature was 99degs F. I bought it from Big Al's Online and they were great with the return."
4,Is lakeshore becoming the next best thing for movie soundtracks?...,"I mean,there's only two scores which are nice to listen to,the rest of the songs are really great and all seem to be on the movie and there's another great Lakeshore soundtrack available : Disturbia.Most of people are absoloutly crazy about the Catch and Release soundtrack but my first choice would be this one.Every songs are well put together and even if there's a couple of oldies it's OK cause they are great follow ups to the rest of the soundtrack.What more can I say...if you love romantic comedy soundtracks or good compilations of really great music you should buy this one without hesitate."
1,A very misleading advertisement,"This part of the item description is very misleading:""For all PCS, Cellular and Nextel Carriers""This item will *NOT* do Cellular (800/850 MHz) or Nextel (IDEN)Here's a breakdown of the CAE50 model numbers. The CAE50PCSis what this ad is for.CAE50CEL = 800/850 Mhz (Normal old Cellular)CAE50PCS = 1900 Mhz (PCS)CAE50NXT = IDEN (Nextel)CAE50-DA4KSBR = Dual Band 800/850 & 1900The last model is as close as you can get to a do everything unit, but it still won't do Nextel. Make sure what your carrier is using in your area before you buy any cell repeater.Happy & Wise Shopping. - Joe"
2,bogus boogie,"I bought this album on the strength of ""V~Neck Sweater"" a song that was included in a PASTE magazine sampler. I admit that I'd never heard of this band prior to hearing that song. ""V~Neck Sweater"" is the best song on the album. ""Give the Drummer Some More"" is not bad & neither is ""How Glad I Am"". Most of it sounds like warmed over 1970's era FUSION. I doubt if I'll ever play this CD again."
4,Inventive modern world-jazz,"To begin with a digression, I've always found the much-vaunted Brazilian diva Virginia Rodrigues' contralto vocals to be a bit unpleasant and her musical approach to be dull; but I've also wondered if it was *just* her voice that bugged me, or if I might like her better in a less stuffy surrounding. Well, here's the answer. Venezuelan jazz singer Maria Marquez has a remarkable vocal similarity to Rodrigues, but her arrangements are infinitely more varied and adventuresome, and her music is much more interesting. Although ultimately this album was too noodly and ""jazzy"" for me, it was still pretty engaging, and I would recommend it to folks who appreciate similar efforts by Marlui Miranda or Nana Vasconcelos and Egberto Gismonti. She's aided here by the cream of Northern California's younger generation of Latin Jazz musicians, notably John Santos and Omar Sosa... A strong effort with some nice, lyrical passages."
2,"""B"" for boring.","""Nature's Princess"" is touted as something to do with the singers relationship with nature... This lady needs a producer who is willing to criticize and add to her ideas. It's not that that she is without any talent, but left to her own, she just doesn't explore the potential of her material. This album gets a ""B"" for boring."
5,Great Gift,My husband loves the Pimp Stixxx for cleaning and detailing his Harley. It was a great gift. Very nice product.
3,Ok! But nothing to great,"The concept is good. But as a professional detailer, I wasn't thrilled by this set. It was just ok! The set could come with a better case; as this case does not hold the items well!"
1,waste of money,This is a tiny book with only 30 pages with only 5 recipes and 6 little stories about india (large letters). I am really dissapointed especially because it is quite expensive. Buy every book but this one!
4,"slightly out-dated, but informative book","This book is a must for the true paphiopedilum grower. This book contains in-situ photographs, and cultural information for all but the newest paphiopedilum species. The Parvi's are the least covered group of paphs. Highly recommended."
5,One of my top 5 favorite books ever!,"I just adored this book and wanted it to go on and on. Maybe it's because I wanted to spend my summers growing up in Provincetown, but the writing is dead-on and masterful. Breathtaking passages that read like poetry. I'm passing it on to all my childhood friends. Thanks Amy."
1,Yes that's outdated!!,"I am majorly disappointed with this book. I was really shopping around for Case In Point / Vault Guide to Case Interview, but since those books aren't carried by my local bookstore and I need that quickly, I end up choosing this as it has an electronic version. It's no good. FULL STOP. It's like a random summary of a MBA courses, Porter's five forces etc.. But I don't think this book is helping with dealing with case interview at all, rather it's confusing the candidate especially for those non-MBA students who didn't know about those infamous business framework. It's giving them a incomplete and useful illustrations. Disappointed..."
2,Too basic,"I gave a quick read of this. Not sure how to rate it. Motherhood and apple pie. Nothing earth shattering. Basics repeated. Prepare, dont loose cool, practise makes perfect. Now that's the secret sauce for a sucessful case interview according to the book."
3,fairly good,This guide is fairly good and useful before interviewing. Also recommend the Vault Guide to Case Interviews.... Good luck.
1,Outdated pamphlet from an outdated firm,"This pre-911 ""book"" is laughably outdated. Too much has changed since it was written. You'd be much better off finding sources on the web. If you go into the interview with this archaic information, you're going to get killed in the interview."
5,Loving Him without Losing You,"I am sure that Beverly's book will prove helpful to any woman -or man- who reads it. After fourteen years with my husband,ten of which have been married, we were in a funk. After reading ""Loving Him without Losing You,"" I learned how to ask for more; care for others more meaningfully; comfort myself more lovingly and stand against things that were not necessarily helpful. Our relationship has become much more nourishing. I highly recommend this book to every woman who wants to become more whole in her life. Thank you, Beverly!"
5,Self Therapy,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Read it a couple times. I use it to give myself therapy. Reading it was painful, understanding yet convincing. The advice given very practical and really does work. Motivating. Thank you Ms. Beverly Engel."
1,Deceptive Reviews,"I bought this book thinking it would be helpful in my marriage. My husband is a wonderful man, but very strong in his opinions. I thought reading this book would help me to be more firm in my own opinions when they differ from his. Instead it was a book that told women to separate themselves from their spouse in finances and in their personal lives! The number one cause for divorce in the first 5 years in America is money problems and having separate account inflames those issues. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends! This book is only for emotionally abused women. The average women looking for some tips on how to improve their marriage should not read this. It was a complete waste of my money."
5,"If you are looking, you need this book!","I am amazed at how dead on every chapter of this book was for me. If you have problems keeping your footing in relationships, you MUST read this book!"
5,Great Book!,"I absolutely loved this book! I wish they thought of a different title though. They make it seem like it's all about the guy. When really, it's all about loving yourself no matter who you are with!"
4,Looking for a self help book to help you find yourself?,"This book was very helpful. It had several exercises to help the reader figure out why she loses herself in a relationship. It had different case studies in it so that the reader could get an idea of who she is most like, so that she could use the appropriate exercise to help her heal. After reading this book I felt a deeper understanding of myself. Definitely for those who feel that something is missing in a relationship."
4,A GOOD COMPANION FOR ITALO DISCO LOVERS!,Italo Disco is a genre that sold millions of records all over the world expecially during the period late seventies/eighties.Italy produced a lot of fantastic disco records and this 3-cd set is a good companion for those who love this music and afor all people who'd like to learn how to love it!
2,"For Italo Disco or ""eurodance music"" fans","This collection is just another compliation of all the main great songs from the ""Italo Disco"" era from the mid '80's. I would recomend this set of CD's to anyone who is not that familiar with Italo Disco who has just listened to regular American music all their life. If you want to hear quality pop dance music that normally has never been aired in the USA than you will love these songs and the lyrics are all in English too! When I ordered this CD I found that I already had all these songs on vinal from back then... still worth having this in my collection! Oh yes and for your info these are all the ""short"" radio versions not the extended 12"" versions"
3,classic hits,"there are some great classic hits on this cd, like patty ryan , stay with me tonight, colder than ice ,dolce vita, and some that you will remember along the way, but simply there are not enough big hits , so you might be a little disappointed , if you expect 3 cds of hits, there are some strange songs, but its still defitently worth buying!"
3,Ancient tradition.,"This product is taking the ancient and honorable tradition of ""use every part of the animal"" to a whole new level."
2,"NOT a ""checklist""!","Call me lazy, but I was really looking for a spare, organized month-by-month or week-by-week CHECKLIST. This is a regular book (albeit a short/small one) and not a particularly well-organized one at that. I want to know what to do when . . . I don't want safety tips for strollers or fluffy and outdated information on maternity clothes. Save your money; I wish that I had."
4,Pretty good for first time Mom's.,"This being a first pregnancy for me, I was very interested in this book. It hasn't let me down. The book is pretty good really, & I would recommend it to any first time Mom who is uncertain of when she should buy what. The author explains how to use the book, breaks down the checklist by trimesters, offers advice for after the baby arrives, & even includes a pregnancy calander.While not chock full of information about pregnancy in general, the book does give you guidelines to follow for purchasing important baby items & making baby plans. I think I'll use this book throughout my pregnancy. It's definitiely worth the money"
2,Title Inaccurate and Content out of date,"I would suggest skipping this one, even at the low price, and buying the latest Baby Bargains -- This book appears hastily put together, has information that is so self-evident it doesn't need to be stated, snubs its ""target"" audience of first time mothers by putting in a whole section on preparing siblings for the birth, and has out of date information -- The Midas car seat deal it suggests is no longer offered, for example. Also it has no index, so even for the few things I found interesting were very hard to find again."
1,A waste of time,"Unrequited - ok read, ending was too abrupt.Victim of Deception - Max was a jerk and never likeable therefore the sex was abhorrent, the heroine too easily manipulated so this story was basically ""awful""!!"
3,Mainly video,"This software is primarily composed of video segments. The software is not as interactive as other educational software. The interactive section quizes are limited. However, the math topics are presented well and included enough humor to keep my son interested. He has voluntarily watched all the video's multiple times."
3,Not a bad product!,"This product is good if you want to learn about math, pre-algebra, algebra, and geometry. I wouldnt recommend it if you just want to learn about one of these because yould be paying too much. Anyway its an excellent source for math education."
2,Hacky sack,The picture made it look like there were three hacky sacks for sale and we only received one. Other than that we were pleased with it.
1,Blindsided by Gore,Thank you movie for blindsiding me with an animal getting its head cut off. I'm not an animal activist of any sort but if you're going to have that in your movie at least warn me so I choose not to watch. Viewer beware.
1,Only region A in blue ray!,what's wrong with that? I bought it as a respect act for the director Ridley scptt. in Italy we were even able to see it. Only with youtube. and it gets out only region a?!?!?
4,PC Video card,The video card performs very nicely. No problems with the installation or the software drivers. Gives a very nice resolution.
3,Nice cheap option for dual monitors,"The first card I received wouldn't properly display in a dual-monitor setup. After working with EVGA's support team, I shipped the product to them and they replaced it with a working model. They're support team was very helpful and willingly replaced the defective card. My only gripe was that I had to pay to ship it to them, that cost me another $10, so you have to add that to the original price. This is a good cheap option for anyone wanting a dual monitor setup. I'm a little disappointed in the NVidia settings for dual monitors, instead of having two separate screens, the software wants to combine monitors to make one big monitor. The only other option is clone mode, which does me no good. When combined, if you maximize a window, it is stretched across both screens. This makes it hard to read the text in the middle of the screen where the monitors split. I am currently exploring the Nvidia settings and hopefully will have this problem resolved soon."
5,trance classics 2,"orcasmyst truly cares about it's customers. my package arrived amazingly fast, and the packaging was superior. great job!"
4,Bang!,"Ok, it's a homage book. A homage to Sam Peckinpah. Or maybe even John Wayne. Excellent use of the comic medium to tell the story of a band of bank robbers on a final heist, with Fraction's offbeat transitions and Dwyer's sepia-stained art-- it instantly becomes an American classic. It's been a long time since an action book the likes of a John Woo film has come my way (with the probable exception of 100 Bullets), and Independents doesn't disappoint at all."
3,"IF I VANISH, THIS WILL TELL YOU WHY...","This is not the type of film you would sit down with the family to watch. HOWEVER, if the rapture was to happen and someone wanted guidance, this is the tape for them. I will leave it with my belongings and in my will, JUST IN CASE."
2,Poor to Fair art work reduces the power of story telling,"After Wendy's bold and beautiful brush strokes, these stories about Ember suffers much from mediocre artwork. The story is not too bad though."
3,Worth reading but not the best in the series,"At first I was greatly disappointed by the artwork and plot of this book, but it got much better toward the end. I'm not sorry I bought it, and I'm eager to read the continuation of the tale in the next volume. There's some interesting and poignant character development going on here with Skywise, and the cliffhanger ending leaves me with a strong sense of mystery and suspense. Anyone reading ""Shards,"" ""Ascent,"" and ""Reunion"" should read this one to see what's happening with the rest of the tribe while some of the elves are busy with Winnowill."
5,figurine,"purchased the set for my daughter as a baby, and I am glad I can do so now for my grand daughter."
3,Newer does not mean better,"I get to play this at a store, and it's actually a nice and speedy unit. However, it's too expensive for a PDA that has only 32MB ram and no integrated wireless. I think the Ipaq 1950 looks and feels better than the RZ1715. For a similar price, you can get a Dell Axim X30 with WiFi and Bluetooth, Intel PXA270 312Mhz CPU, 64MB RAM, user replacable battery...etc. I think HP will lose a big portion of the PPC market to Dell, due to its high price. I really don't see why would anyone buy this over a Dell Axim X30..."
5,Worth every penny!,"My in-laws very sweetly bought this ipaq for me. When I heard the sales person say it was a ok entry level PDA, my heart sank a little..but considering the price, it seemed to be more than just that.. and well, after I had played around with it, I found out that I was right! Unless you are into serious gaming, this PDA is the thing for you.. don't be disheartened by the memory provided.. the expansion slot does let you expand your horizons as much as you want.. for wi-fi connectivity, you can put in a card.. but honestly, it serves it's purpose very well.. I am changed person.. I don't forget things because now I have a trusted companion to remind me of things that need to be done.. but it is not boring at all.. I also use it for reviewing powerpoint presentations, scribbling quick notes and of course, the games.. :) It is an awesome little thing to have.. and is all that I wanted..go for it!!"
2,warning: the battery is not removable,"I had a chance to try this unit in personthe major drawback is: the battery is not removablethat means, you can't use this unit for extended period of time without chargingand, the price is way too high without wireless"
2,"Nice Big Book, Nice Pictures, But Virtually No Information.","Gordon's book about Rolex is a nice, ""coffee-table"" type of book featuring some really nice pictures of the company's first models to the more contemporary pieces that were produced in the 1980s. If you are a Rolex fanatic, this is probably something that you want to have on your bookshelf. However, there is virtually no information about any of the watches Gordon shows in the book. It is basically a picture book. If you want historical information about the models and the manufacture, you need to buy James Dowling's book on Rolex. It is about the same price, and it is so much better than Gordon's effort (or lack thereof)."
3,A bit too basic,"If you know little to nothing of fermentation and distillation, this book may be considered informative. It is a basic overview of the distillation process and equipment; a bit too basic. The processes are explained in such generic and simplistic terms, that it reads more like an opening lecture in distilling 101, not a manual for practical distilling. If what you seek is a casual understanding of alcohol distillation, this book is for you. If you want a companion text for practical distilling applications, The Home Distillation Handbook will be a disappointment."
2,You get what you pay for.,"It was all fine and I was deeply impressed with how well it suited my simple needs for such a low price -- until the hard drive died on me after six months!So I said, stuff happens, there's a one-year warranty, let's send it in. Not a good experience. Spent almost a hundred dollars for shipping both ways, and service fulfillment was the worst. Said they were going to call me to ask for my credit card number, but when after a week, they still hadn't, I called them, and it was a big runaround -- long wait times, being transferred to voice mails, the usual waste of time we are all regularly subjected to...Conclusion: Back up your files. But still pray the hard drive doesn't die on you, because if it does, it's the biggest hassle to get it fixed. Good luck!"
1,Averatec price = averatec quality,"I am surprised by the number of positive reviews and the high score that this item received. Perhaps they were predominantly written just after purchase. At that time, my feelings were warm as well, albeit not as warm as the laptop itself after a few minutes of use. After one year of not-too-intensive use, I am unhappy. The batteries died out almost instantly. When my students saw me coming with it to give a lecture, they immediately started asking questions about poor batteries... And technical support in case of a problem? Totally incompetent. After many calls and contradictory pieces of advice, one thing has been clarified: the ""part number"" shown on the back of the laptop is incorrect! Don't buy unless you like endless and meaningless conversations with incompetent tech reps."
3,Cute Computer,"I received this laptop as a college gift. It's a great little computer, and it's good for what I need to get done. However, I have noticed a few problems. The computer gets VERY HOT fairly quickly during usage. I expect this is true for many small laptops, but from what I have experienced, this one needs a larger fan. Also, my monitor occasionaly flickers. Only owning this one year, I am very disappointed in the malfunction. I have been told that the monitor is often the first thing to go on a laptop, but less than a year and already having problems???? Also, the paint that is used does not hold up very well. My college notebooks have murdered the top of the computer. Other than these above mentioned issues, the computer is nice. Small enough to fit into my backpack. Excellent for CD burning. Very compatible with programs. Impressive to friends (because of it's size). Easy to type on (it does take a while to get used to such a small piece of equipment)."
1,Do NOT Buy Averatec,We bought two Averatec Computers. Both have had to go in for service. Their service department is a nightmare. Expect three to four weeks for a simple repair and do not expect to get a straight answer about the status of your RMA repair.
2,Too slow,A friend bought from them and he isn't too happy. It's just way too slow. I suppose he should have known better but he's not exactly a computer geek. So I would be carefull about buying this if you need something with some kick to it.
1,incoherene plot-gore galore,"Basic slasher film that doesn't even rate one star.But I do give it one star for the 2 uncut scenes added to the disc.The one with porn queen Jenna's inplants being so durable that the guy no matter how hard he tried to chew on them couldn't make them leak.The second scene of the anal probe with the knife was a prime biological example that the human body has one hell of a long intestine. That guy's intestines even flatulated during the removal process.Although extremely gory ya cant help but laugh at this whole globby mess.Im still in the dark what the ending was about it made no sense at all.But I guess chewey implants, farting bowel removals and bouncing breasts was what the whole plot line of this film anyway."
3,severely edited,"UNfortuately. Tons of ""offensive"" footage (nudity and gore) was cut so the movie suffered trmendously. This movie was trying to be released for years and years now ...this was the only way to get it mass distributed: cut everything. its sad."
3,Beautiful Gore,"This movie wasn't that bad. There's a beautiful cast of porno star's that make the movie. There is really good special effect too. The gore is all there. The scene with Jenna Jameson is my favorite. The story could have been a little better, but it was a great B-Movie. Well worth a watch."
3,"Jenna was better than the ""actors""","Another mutated, inbred, mountain ""family"" who like to chop up and eat stupid college hiker kids who just insist on getting lost in the woods in the dark. Jenna had a funny scene when she gets caught and is being cut up by one of the mutant mountain men and he reaches into her chest and pulls out a silicone boob enlargement sack, which he sniffs and tosses into a pile of bones. Hilarious! Other than that this one is pretty forgetable, rent Devils Rejects for a real mutant inbred treat."
2,one more thrown together horror movie,The two uncut scenes added can give it one more star than it probably deserves. Don't spend too much if you have to buy it out of curiousity like I did.
1,So bad it's....BAD,"Wow, this was not a good movie. I expected cheap B horror, but this movie just didn't come through. It was really kind of insulting the way they implied the hideous monters had anything to do with Druidism. The only bright spot was the correct pronoucation of the word Samhian."
2,Warped and miscolored,"The flag insignia is slightly off and there are white streaks on the red cross. However, I do not believe this is the sellers fault but is probably manufacturing. For what I have paid on other products I expected more. It was probably just one in a 1000 and i plan to continue business realizing this."
2,"Beware: ""video"" here means VHS not DVD!!","I had to pay for this to be duplicated onto DVD, because nothing in the original ad indicated it was a VHS."
1,VHS,"Who has a VHS anymore? Do they still sell them in stores? Now I have a ""video"" that I cannot watch. Thanks."
3,PHIL COLLINS LIVE AT MONTREUX 2004 BLU-RAY,THIS WAS A GREAT SHOW BUT THE SOUND LET IT DOWN.BUT DONT LET IT PUT YOU OFF STILL WORTH THE PURCHASE.
3,Terrible audio mix,"Im giving this disc a 3 stars review mainly based on the quality of the audio mix... the engineer on this show must have been drunk or something. In the first song (something happened on the way to heaven) the horns are barely hearable which is ridiculous considering they are one of the most important parts of this song, then on ""Against all Odds"", Amy Keys starts singing and the mic is off for like 10 seconds, etc. This show is full of audio engineering mistakes and problems and the overall sound quality is far from Good. Other than that the disc is great as a casual watching, but do not expect this Blu Ray to amaze you."
4,Great concert. Sound engineer could've been better,"This is a great concert to own. It is well worth the price. The only complaint I can come up with is one shared by others on this product. The sound engineer must've been asleep during the concert or when putting together this disc. Volume of the horns is poor on ""Something Happened on the Way to Heaven"" and could be better throughout. Otherwise, this is a great concert and Phil Collins provides masterful entertainment as always."
2,"Same concert, different cover","I bought this hoping to hear something new, but it is really the same concert as Paris concert. Whatever ""big band"" new stuff as advertised is not there. Phil is always great, just didn't need two concerts with different names and same content."
4,√≥tima performance,"show muito bom do phil collins, √≥timo cantor e bateirista o blu-ray chegou de forma r√°pida e em perfeito estado"
4,Good Enough,"Although very good, I cannot say this is the best concert you can find from Phil Collins. In my opinion, Phil's Serious Hits Live! Concert is much better than this one. However, the sound of this Blu-Ray is very good, most of his hits are included and, in general, it is a very good product."
3,similar!!,"Phil Collins: Finally - The First Farewell TourI have this 2DVD farewell tour which i would say even better than live at montreux. The DVD is phil with his band as oppose to BRD's the band playing phil's best songs. If you have a good player, there's not much of a difference."
2,Phil Collins Retired,"Sound and picture ok but short of Blue Ray quality. His performance was weak at best. Perhaps he is past his prime...his voice coach should be fired. Legends like Elton John, Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton adjusted to their aging voices but Phil seems to lack the effort...perhaps his heart just isn't in it. I would suggest that real fans stick to his previous live concerts as this one does not reflect the talent of the man."
2,Good Book to Put You to Sleep--Case For Spell-Checking,"Haven't finished it yet. Seriously, it puts me to sleep. I'm about 2/3 through it, but I'm determined to finish. So far the book is very different than what I expected. I wanted to understand the Palestinian Israeli conflict. Instead I'm reading about this guy's vacations, and transcripts from tourist bulletins about how many Jews lived in Israeli towns over the centuries. Supposedly I'm coming to what I want.I'm surprised that a PhD could use such poor grammar and spelling. Seriously, did they not have a budget for an editor? I would think that he'd have a little more pride in his work."
4,Out of Joint,"i did appreciate a lot of the things that the author was trying to convey - I feel that this is a very personal take on how her journey has been with RA. There were a lot of ethnic references that she related to, that others who are not of her ethnicity would not understand as a truth in this medical condition, but overall, she made her point clear. RA is very invasive and it changes your life to the very core,I am enjoying readint the book very much"
4,Well worth the read.,"I always like to read an experience from the inside and this first person telling is very expressive and well worth the read.I would like to also recommend Carol Levy's A Pained Life, a chronic pain journey.It is of the same autobiographical mold.The author in this book tells of her struggle with and against a facial pain disorder called trigeminal neuralgia - also called ""the worst pain known to man"" and ""the suicide disease.""It has been called ""hard to out down"" by the American Chronic Pain Association"" and ""a fascinating story"" by Steve Hall, writer, NY Times magazine.If you enjoyed Out Of Joint I think this will also be a good read for you.[...]"
3,"Contrary to sub-title, this book is all excuses","I love Berger's Verdi with a Vengeance and Wagner without Fear: although Berger obviously has enormous respect for these two great opera composers, he is not timid about poking fun where deserved.Puccini without Excuses is another matter altogether. The entire tone of this book is defensive: poor maligned Puccini, critically under-appreciated. The information in this book is colored by this attitude of the author, and because of this defensive tone, we don't get the feeling of respect and love that Berger transmits in both Verdi... and Wagner...Nevertheless, this book is useful for the synopses of most of Puccini's operas and other bits of information, especially a very thought-provoking take on Il Trittico, as well as a sense of what you might expect to see in the staging of a production."
5,Once you have listened to Puccini there's no need to read about him.,"There is a Compact Disc (CD) sold on Amazon entitled The UltimatePuccini. Check it out.For a real adventure go to this search engine:[...], then enter The Ultimate Puccini. You want the first entry which shows the CD sold by Amazon. Wonder first about [...]...then get comprehensive details about the CD.[...]I have cutting edge files on classical music, world art, world literature, and very beautiful files on quotations.Don DuboisSaline MI 48176[...]"
2,Child Development with Multimedia Courseware CD and PowerWeb,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! I purchased what I thought was Child Development Book with Multimedia Courseware CD and PowerWeb as staed on Amazon, but when I recieved the package, it was not what I had expected to find. It was the BOOK ONLY and DID NOT INCLUDED THE MULIMEDIA COURSEWARE CD AND POWERWEB. This was very disappointing because I would not have purchased this if it was only the book, as I need the CD and POWERWEB for my course! I think that it should have been listed as BOOK ONLY!"
5,Cool Game! :),"This game was the first one that I got for my new Game Boy Color. The first few levels can be a bit frustrating, because you don't have all of the charecters, but once you get past level 5(which shouldn't take long)you'll feel better. I would reccomend this game most to kids at least 10 years old. Why? My sister, who is 8, has a bit of trouble playing.This game is great for those who love adventure, have an intrest in dinosaurs, or just those who want to have FUN!"
1,a frustrating game,"I got this game(which I wanted)for my birthday. I was disappointed. I hate the music, I hate the background, I hate the game. It is frustrating because you always have to change characters and if you mess up one time by jumping off something, you have to start all over again!! I thought it was going to be like the movie, but it is about the farthest from the movie you can get. So if you haven't seen the movie, like changing charcters 59 times, and love starting over 'til you're ready to smash the game, get this game."
2,A bit disappointing,"I was hoping that the arrangements would be more romantic... they aren't. ""Love for Sale"" is the only clear winner on this CD. I will donate the CD to our local library, and download specific songs in the future, after reviewing them."
1,horrible!!,"A major disappointment. Almost every track on this CD features a singer who obviously is sick to death of these old songs and desperate to change, improve, fix, or just plain eliminate the tunes that Cole Porter wrote. Loud, vulgar over-produced brassy nonsense reeking of the worst of 60's TV variety shows. The only exception was Night and Day, sung by Fred Astaire (probably the most underrated singer in US history). He alone seemed to really like the tunes and words that Porter wrote. I tossed this CD after one, cringing listen."
2,Many of the Artists' Renditions Disappointing,Will try to resell this CD or maybe give it to my 80 year old mother. Many of the artist's are more of her era. Will keep looking for a really good Cole Porter CD.
2,Ok Double Boiler,"I was quite excited when I ordered this. I make chocolate every year and melted it in three containers. One was two corningare bowls stacked which I have used for years. One was a double boiler pan you place on top another (borrowed from the neighbor. I almost bought this but didnt because I saw this and thought wow), and this. The other two worked much better than this one, kept the chocolate melted, and no one had issues burning their hands. I think its too deep and not wide enough on top but everyone from kids to adults burned themselves on the sides at least a couple times. I was so excited to get this but now wish I would have bought the one that sits on top the pot my neighbor borrowed to me that worked better and cost less. Many kool inventions are awesome, this one wasnt as much"
2,Bonjour Double Boiler,I loved the idea of using one pot for double boiling. Problem is it whistles very loudly the whole time you are using it (as the water inside is boiling) and drives everyone crazy.Neat pot though and easy to keep clean.
5,Dr. Joyce Ladner's book is a must read for all parents.,Dr. Ladner's book is an excellent presentation of ways to keep the family together. The traditional values that families imparted many years ago are essential today and must be called upon to deal with the negative impact of environment. This scholarly written book is inspirational and compelling. Dr. Ladner has effectively outlined strategies to help all parents deal with the difficult task of being a parent. I would encourage all parents to purchase this book and share the many lessons with family members and children.
5,Excellent,"I had the PSC-950 Unpacked,setup, and operating in less time than I usually spend trying to get my old scanner and printer to work. Setup was easy, print quality is great,quiet,fast,and the photocard feature is great. Probably the best choice on computer equiptment I ever made."
1,Will make you crazy enough to buy another printer,"I can't stand this printer. This is the most frustrating machine I have ever owned. Half the time the printer gets stuck and prints lines on the second sheet of paper printed. If you want to fax multiple pages - - - plan on aging!! You have to scan each page then pray the person you are faxing picks up. Otherwise - start scanning each page again. The 15 page fax will take 45 minutes - if you're lucky. The machine will say, ""black ink low"". Yet you can print another 200 pages with no sign of low ink!!! I am really sorry I bought this machine. I don't think I will be purchasing another HP product for a while."
1,Do not buy this under any circumstances.,The HP psc 950 is a totally useless pick of equipment. I would not recommend buying it or in fact any HP products until they get their service and customer support situation sorted out. This device worked fine for about the first six months and since then I have had nothing but problems with it. According to my web research many users are having similar issues. It seems that there is a problem with the temperature sensor on the scanner which causes it to malfunction (read; not work) when it is cold. HP wants to charge me $30 to tell me this which is totally unacceptable. If they had any sense they would recall the faulty sensor and let us all get back to work. I am at the stage now where I shopping for a new device. It will not be an HP and I very much look forward to kicking my 950 down the street.
3,Forget the fax and automatic photo features;rest is great,"We were very excited almost a year ago when we got this hot off the ""press,"" but have been disappointed in some respects since then. The machine was not yet set up to work with Windows XP and is still not on ours despite repeated requests for upgrades. It registers as a 920 series on Win XP. It does a great job of printing, both B&W and color. It even produces great photographs from the scanner portion, but not from the added features to make them print straight from your camera. The [local store] people did not know that it was brand selective on this and that's our problem. I have not been able to receive a fax, but have been able to send short faxes. It's a great over priced printer."
1,Mac users stay away!,HP's updates lag Apple's OS upgrades by months. Support personnel are baffled when you call with a question about a Mac. Ridiculously long wait times for support. We'll be buying another printer soon.
5,Hp 950 All in one,"The product is fully functional and it is exactly as described. I would definately purchase other items from this particular seller. They were efficient in expediting shipment and when I made contact with them after shipment was received, they responsed very quickly."
2,What HP and Dell Don't Tell You...,"From a Techs point of view, the printer resolution in printing documents and pictures are great. Where the printer fails is in its faxing capability. It has to scan to fax, unfortunately the scanner is less than adaquate. Faxed text is received blured. Also, on some newer model Dell's (2.6G)machines, be sure to download the lastest software drivers from HP and be sure to uninstall all the software that came with the HP PSC 950 unit before loading the newest files, and don't reload the software that came with the printer."
1,"HP Printer, the worst","This printer isn't worth your time. HP makes some of the worst printers.Sorry, but after this one I'll never buy HP again."
2,Why was my review not posted?,"I submitted a review a while back which pointed out several problems, including excessive and expensive cartridge consumption, garbled printing (really a surprise, lines printing on top of one another, spacing off-haven't seen this kind of problem since dot matrix print drivers), USB glitches (sluggish computer, computer freezes), etc.Is there a reason my detailed review wasn't posted?I followed the guidelines, was polite, evidence based, etc."
3,question??,Can anyone tell me if I 'd like to buy this product and bring it back to my country that can use only 220V? just only an adapter is enough?? I'm not sure whether or not I can use it in my country..
3,HP PSC 950 - Paper Feed Problems,"The HP PSC950 is a good value. Excellent print quality onphoto paper. But I have had a significant problem with the paperfeed. Paper jams frequently, and access to the inside of the printer to retrieve the damaged document is difficult."
2,"If It's Not One Thing, It's Another","Purchased this product the end of August 2002- we have XP, so set it up according to directions (without start up disk). Worked great for 2 weeks, then began malfunctioning. HP said they'd send me the XP installer disk. Tried that, no help. They said maybe it was in a cold area (it's next to the tropical bird's cage). Finally, they said it was a hardware problem, so I paid ... to have it overnighted New one arrived, also was defective. HP customer rep rudely refused to refund my shipping charge, offered to send another one. Called Office Max, and even though I don't have a receipt, they exchanged it for a new one, which is working great (for two days)... we'll see"
2,950 turning into a sow's ear...,"I've had HP products that worked for years and years....this was the flagship of their multifunction line when I bought it for a small office....the first year or 2 it worked great....but is progressively degrading into scrap....It is cranky, at times not wanting to copy, other times flashing its ""Busy"" message...or 'warming up' for an hour or 2....So it looks like I've got another wasted investment in HP stuff....I'm going to find something else"
5,A wonderful device,This product is an absolute winner. Nothing negative to say.Scanner is execeptionally good quality. Color printing fantastic. Printing photos from camera slot is easy and fun. No problems with XP that I've seen. Lots of power from this small device.Will by a second psc 950 for my Mom.Way to go HP!
1,Mac users STAY AWAY!!!,This the most unstable software I have ever seen - constant crashes and calls to tech support. Don't even think about it if you have a PowerBook. I gave it one star becuse it seems to work fine as a stand alone.
4,Worth the buy,"For the puposes served, this book is worth the buy (for those thinking about the stock removal methods). Takes you step by step through the knifemaking process and as the title implies. As a bonus, it has sections on sheathmaking (which is part of the craft) and etching. The etching section however, is a bit dated as it uses techniques that are now inferior. Do yourself a favor and go with electro etching instead..safer AND produces higher quality etches.My only complaint is that the photos could have been better."
3,step by step,"Clear an concise, .it's exactly what the title implies,.cudos to boye for unravelling the mystery of man's most ancient of tools an the making there of in today's modern wprld"
1,Worthless,This book is very basic and confusing.. There are many better book out there that cover the subject much better.
4,The Lakes Live,"This book is a beauty. I suggest that after you receive it, you buy a couple bottles of strong French-Canadian beer (La Fin Du Monde, for example) throw in a Classical CD on repeat and start flipping pages. On a rainy day here in San Francisco, where I am now, I can feel myself being transported to the most mystical place I have yet to visit--after seeing nearly all of the U.S., Europe, and Asia--nothing compares to a sunset on Lake Michigan, a snowstorm on Lake Superior, or a sunrise on Lake Huron."
5,A Must Read for any Michigander,"I have lived in Michigan all of my life and this book brought made it come alive for me. Having spent time in Leelanau County and seeing the Malabar many times, this book was extremely special. For anyone who has lived in Michigan, this book is a must. From the historical perspective to the current day adventure, this book will keep you riveted. I felt as if I was on the journey with the crew of the Malabar and was extremely saddened when the voyage was over. This is a book I will read more than once."
4,lake,"Very nice reading-interesting book. was disappointed in the fact that I spend more time on lake erie and that it was covered the least of the other great lakes and regions. nothing about the pelee passage that has more shipwrecks than anywhere else,etc......"
3,Lake Ontario....the Ugly Sister??,"I was looking specifically for information and stories of Lake Ontario, but the poor body of water was all but ignored in this book. Perhaps a new title is in order: ""Four Great Lakes and....um, What Was That Little One Called?"" Being the gateway to the St. Lawrence, one would think Ontario would merit a real place in this book. Well written, seems to be well-researched, but disappointing still.I am editing this review now: In all fairness, the chapters on the other Great Lakes is very interesting and informative and fun to read. Good history stories, both natural history, storms, shipwrecks and people history. Author has a real sense of the natural world and does seem to love the lakes. For the other four Great Lakes, including the hilariously nicknamed Skeerie Erie, very fun read."
2,Tired of nextels service,"Doesn't seem to help that much, switching service when my contract runs out."
4,Good Product Great Price,"I go through a lot of head bands, so I like to have a bunch on hand. Additionally, they don't last forever. I was able to buy them in bulk from GOGO at a far cheaper price than other brands. They work just as well."
5,"better than my ""high end"" bands",This was surprisingly softer than my more expensive sweat bands. I like it better. Very absorbent.
3,eh,"Shrunk after first wash to the point where I can't use it any more. Given my naagan is rather large, I don't see anyone but kids being able to use them after being washed. 3 stars for the cheapo price. You get what you pay for I guess."
5,Even makes a teenager giggle!!!!!!,I'm 13 and my best friend is turning 14. A couple months ago we were in walmart and we saw the TURBO TAIL TIGGER and to make a long story short we ended up on the floor giggling like there was no tomorrow! It was SO funny and cool and awsome and fun! After my friend and I stopped laughing(which took a while) she told me she had to have that for her birthday. Her birthday is coming up i just a week so i was thinking of what to get her and then I rememberd Tiger: the perfect gift for all ages!!!!!!
4,Musical Turbo Tail Tigger Review,"It's hard for an adult to not want to play with this toy, therefore children just loveeeeeeeeeeee it!!!!! I only wish he said more. Still a great buy!"
4,Thoughts on turbo tail tigger,I really like this toy along with my 7 month old little guy. We have a jumper that he loves and he loves to bounce along with tigger. The only thing is we put the best kind of batteries in him and he starts to loose his spring very quickly. With fresh batteries he hops rigt off the ground. After a week or two he only bounces in place. Time for new batteries...
1,Didn't Work Long,"This is the second Turbo Tail Tigger I have bought since January. Neither one of them have worked for very long. Replacing the batteries does not make Tigger bounce again. My 16 month old grandson cries because Tigger won't bounce. I am VERY dissatisfied with this product. I paid full price ($30) at Wal-Mart and almost that much for the one I ordered from you, including taxes and shipping."
4,Hoppin' good time,"We bought this last Christmas for our then 1 year old daughter. She loved it and played with it everyday until it broke. It stopped jumping after just a couple of days. However, Amazon sent us a new one right away. It still jumps and our daughter still plays with it. Our 5 year old son likes it too. The two of them play and laugh and jump with Tigger. It's hilarious! If the first one had not broken, I would have given this toy a 5 star rating."
5,great fun for my little one,My daughter is 1 year old and absolutely loves to bounce up and down. This bouncing tigger is the best toy I could have gotten for her. She loves it and its so much fun to watch her doing the same thing as tigger with a smile on her face
5,The Best Vitamins,"These supplements are simply the best. Highly bio-available, worth every penny and I can feel the difference when I forget to take them.I have more energy, higher immune function and just feel better when I take them consistantly.It's true there is no substitute for proper nutrition, but these vitamins are a great way to augment proper nutrition. I have tried many brands and this is the one I will use for the rest of my days."
5,Essential If You Want To Win A Trial,"I am in my fifth year now, and I've still never had a jury trial, because of the explosion of alternative dispute resolution. Despite the diminishing frequency of the jury trial, this book is still an absolute must. To me, the following points the author makes are accurate--you must conduct litigation like you will go to trial, and, on occasion, you must actually go to trial. This book teaches you how to act like a real litigator. He emphasizes being a ""bulldog about documents,"" and states the best depositions are the ones that draw blood. He also tells you how to pick a jury, how to open, how to conduct direct and cross, and how to close, among other things. In fairness, there really are just too many good parts to single anything out--the whole damn book is invaluable. Further, it is written with humor and with good stories. Highly recommended."
4,Duchess of Idaho,I love the old movies and this one is no exception. I've always been a fan of Esther Williams.Always enjoy buying from Amazon. Service is excellent and products very satisfactory.
4,Esther's water is frozen,"This is one of the better Esther Williams outings. The songs are good, as is the opening swimming number. Van Johnson livens things up and Lena Horne pops in for a song. There is also the added excitement of Sun Valley. The plot is older than the ruins of Ancient Rome, but there is an energy and freshness to the film that makes it easy to overlook the deficiencies."
3,"Movie Great, Film Quality Not So","Would love to give it five stars because the movie is very cute. If you like sweet, dumb, cute old girl flicks this is right up your alley. Beautiful clothes, beautiful people, implausible plot but all happiness in the end when the right guys get the right girls. Towards the end of the movie, there were colored splotches appearing on the screen. I hope it was just my copy but it was returned as defective."
3,terrible packaging,You will temporarily forget about your cold during the 2-3 minutes it takes to open the individual caplet packaging. Two capsules come in a sealed pack that cannot be torn open with mere human hands. You have to get scissors to cut and even then struggle to get the pills out of the tight plastic shell that remains. Who designs packaging like this?
4,He's part of the one-third that can read.,"Ok, I may be a bit biased in being one of Baratunde's comedy cohorts in the up and coming Boston comedy scene, but this book is absolutely a hilarious hoot in political and pop culture satire. If you are a fan of Jon Stewart's ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, you'll love Baratunde's sharp yet playful style of humor aimed at boy bands, politicans, political debates, and technology. Although the format of the book is not traditional due to it's late night news format which may throw you off at times, it definitely keeps you on your toes with it's humor on many subjects. It HAS an edge to it as well, while not being too preachy on one side or the other. My personal favorite pieces are his frustration at white people's fascination with touching his afro and Newsphlash's ""interviews"" with the boy band, ""O-Town"" and USAG John Ashcroft. So if you are part of the one thrid, a this is a highly recommended book!"
2,Don't wear well,"Liked the styleWore first pair occasionally over 6 mo and sole wore through. Seller sold me second pair at reduced cost. These also wore through on sole prematurely. Never had this problem with other dress shoes. To add insult to injury, Allen Edmonds recrafting service isn't available for their ""Italian-made"" shoes. Sadly, a poor investment"
2,Pathetic attempt for a web interface,"The worst web interface I have ever seen. (Tripp Lite, please see APC's web interface!)Secondly, even what little there is, doesn't work correctly on any of the browsers I have tried (firefox,chrome or IE 9), and some of the pages (particularly the Loads page!) come up with an ""error in page"" message and doesn't refresh the screen.Most of the time, I can't use this product now remotely because of this poor interface and bugs in the web page back end in the PDU. The only reason to pay this much money for a PDU is its remote access capability to control the outlets, and if we can't do that, why waste money on this product? There are much better products out there for this price range that do a better job..."
3,Used it for my research,"I think the book was fascinating! I was writing a research on contemporary China and read a few books on the subject, this was one of them. For a person who actually hasn't been to China, tt added up to the understading what China really is all about. It was easy to follow the text and it was easily understandable, so I loved it."
3,Find it on YouTube,"Big note: All the tracks from this hard-to-find album can be found on YouTube. That beats a $50 UK import any day.As for a review: Yes, this is a pretty cool Mediaeval Baebes album, in parts. I liked it quite a bit during the movie. Divorced from that setting, though, the music suffers from far too many dead spots don't deliver much value on their own. I'm sure they made sense as audio ""filler"" in the movie, but what good is that doing me here?These are the coolest stand-alone tracks:1461617These are so-so:29121316These are unremarkable:357810111314151819"
5,Soothing CD,"The soundtrack to The Virgin Queen is so soothing, calming, eerie,haunting and mesmerizing I am so very glad I bought it. It has a medieval sound with a bit of a twist. The instruments used are like no other. It is truly one of a kind."
5,Dragon X Rules in My Comic Strip,"I've put this little guy to a lot of use. I already had one and use him in a great deal in an online comic strip I do called the ""Wildcat's Lair."" My only complaint was that ""Hip,"" as I call him, just isn't easy to pose. I shoved a few very thin metal rods in the new one to solve this problem, and the dragon has held up very well despite the small punctures (which can't even be seen). Very good quality, resulting in a lot of great laughs."
2,Buyer Beware!,"Beware if buying from this merchant from Canada - they insist on shipping by UPS, who charge ridiculous import fees that you have to pay to get the item."
5,Farm Journal's Homemade Breads,"I love this book. I have had it for a long time. In fact I am baking biscuits, as I type, right now. I have made so many breads with this book. I am partial to the sweet breads. My grandson came over to my house, and we made sweet rolls while I cooked dinner. The rolls never got to the table. He ate them, and when his mom came over, she finished them all up. Next time I'll make more than one batch. If you love homemade breads this book is for you."
3,Good transaction...cookbook ??,"My order with Amazon was carried out without a hitch. Reading through the book, I was unimpressed. It is a cookbook. Tried one receipe with so, so results. Maybe time and more use will change my mind, but for now, an average cookbook."
2,"Too Much Gourmet, Not Enough Everyday.","Saw this chef on Rachel Ray and he was showing the audience how to make delicious dishes from leftovers. I thought ""What a great idea"". I'm always throwing out leftovers, because no one in my family will eat them. Most of the recipes in this book are too elaborate for everyday use, and the recipes for the leftovers call for ingredients that are not in the normal households. I would have to go to the store and purchase ingredients to make the leftover recipes, which kind of defeats the purpose. Also the ingredients are not ones that I would normally keep in the house. This book is great when you want to make something for a special occasion."
2,Like food ? This book is for you. Otherwise ummmm....,"Sorry but this book is a little thin on what to see and far too thick on what & where to eat. Almost half the book is all about food, recipies, and places to eat. OK there has to be some but half the book! Once the book does get going about the island itself there seems to be little detail and not much at all on what to see an do. The is a nice chapter at the end about the history of the island and a handy list of lists which sums up the first half of the book! Poor quality pictures and maps too.The problem are there don't seem to many books available on the island..."
3,Anti-American Sentiments a Turn-off,"I know that the authors meant well...but, the anti-american comments were a complete turnoff to an otherwise, well organized, informative book. Not all Americans litter, speak loudly, wear tacky clothes or ""expect everyone to be the same."""
1,Not what I needed,"I bought this pillow for my husband. He suffers from sleep apnea and needs a pillow for neck support. This item was not what he needed. He expected support -- but this pillow was way, way too soft. His head ""squished"" right into it. Also, the pillow came without the removable cover mentioned in the product description on line."
3,"Not exactly as described, average","I always use ""neck pillows"" and have to renew after some time because the middle gives out and gets flat. It seems the covers for the pillows are almost as expensive as the pillows, so when, after much research I found this pillow *WITH* cotton cover (""Removable white polyester/cotton cover is machine washable"") at a good price, I bought 4 to stock up. To my disappointment the "" removable cotton cover"" was actually just the outer layer of fabric that keeps the stuffing in, not a removable pillow case as I had thought I was going to get. After the first night using it I thought the pillow was already squishing down. It seems to have plateaued after several uses, and not getting too thin too fast. The cotton outer fabric is a step up from other pillows that have a papery outer fabric, so this is a plus, just not what I'd expected. For the price, I would purchase again, but don't expect to get a removable, washable pillow case."
2,No removable cover,"This is a very nice and squishy pillow, but this item did not come with a removable cover. I had to purchase a cover for it."
4,Relief,I use this when watch TV and it helps w/neck strain and prevent headaches. I use it nightly along with my waterpillow and I'm sleeping much better again helping to prevent headache. Only down side is there is not a washable cover.
2,Doesn't hold up,"The ordering and delivery were fine, but the quality of the filling leaves alot to be desired, no support and ends up lumpy and uneven in short order."
3,sizzles but....,"This book lives up to the Blaze line reputation for risque. Full of hot sizzling sex and intriguing ideas for forplay, INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE ends up alittle short on story. Recommended for a few good ideas to spice up a lagging real-life romance."
2,Ehh... no pierdas tu dinero...,"Directo al grano. Este cd no sirve. 16 Canciones, 2 dellas ya las habian tirado en otros cds (""Loco"" en Fuera de Serie de L&P, y ""Tus Ojos"" en Luny Tunes 'La Trayectoria') so esas 2 son canciones viejas como quien dice. Las canciones que realmente se pueden escuchar seria la del Ft con Polaco, La de Trebol Clan, Las 2 de Rakim y Ken-Y y la de Chezina. Las demas son tremendas porquerias. Las pistas, se guillaron en algunas mientras en otras no le dieron su 100%. Nicky Jam usando el mismo flow q antes no experimento con diferentes estilos siempre lo mismo y eso cansa. La cancion q ""pego"" o han sonau mucho en PR ahora mismo ha sido la de ""Chambonea"" y nose porq, pq la cancion esta estupida. Sinceramente no gasten en este cd, ya q la mitad y cuidau si menos es lo q vale la pena escuchar, las demas te dan ganas de darle al boton pa cambiar de cancion. Lo escuche 4 veces completo, y no he vuelto a escucharlo pq realmente no me gusto. Mucha promocion para poco cd."
5,"Better than ""black carpet""","This album shows the real Nicky Jam. Good sang hooks, nice beats, some hard, some soft, nice features like RKM & Ken-Y, David Deambulante and more. The special edition comes with a DVD and a better looking cover. This album is twice better than his today`s black carpet."
1,Not a real Karoke CD,"This does not work in a Karoke player unless your plays DVDs. I don't know what format my machine uses, all I know is it's a karoke machine and in theory, should play all karoke CDs.That said, if you like to watch karoke on your DVD player, it's a nice collection.I on the other hand feel like I got ripped off, as I did not see it say clearly anywhere that it will only work in a DVD player."
4,First of Many,This product was used in my laptop and worked perfect. Christmas and newyears entertainment was so much fun. If you haven't tried karaoke this is the way to start having fun.
4,Quick delicious read,A delicious read. Quick and not toochallenging. I read it in an airplane terminal waiting for a late plane. It is nice to have something pleasant to read in situations which do not require your entire attention. Yet the message about coming home and taking a different look gave it just enough suvstance.
3,pretty stiff,"This one will fit better with some than others. I have a longer neck and it's not the most comfy one I own.It's pretty stiff and doesn't mold really to where you put it, so it has a tendency to migrate out of position.i think i just prefer the squishier buckwheat pillows that you can mold to the position you like and it stays there."
1,May not work with your laptop,"I have a Sony Vaio PCG-FX370. While Viking's memory configurator may tell you that this memory is compatible, it might not be. This memory did not work in my laptop.There is also a lot of talk on forums on the internet that claim that Sony Vaio memory slots might be defective, and therefore, new memory sticks might render the computer unable to boot.Be sure to check your memory slots by rotating your memory sticks, before buying new modules, to ensure that you do not have a faulty memory slot."
5,Texas Music Fan,What a refreshing sound! An incredible CD with wonderful songs. If only there were more artists that would be a little more original. I would certainly buy anthing by this artist.
1,"Lies, all lies!!!","This whole book was not true. The author stated a bunch of falsehoods in this book. I agree with the other 2 ratings up here. If you want a TRUE account of what happened, read the book by Gary Solis."
2,So-so,"The acting in this movie was reasonably good. Most of it, anyway. The story was fairly pathetic. It's not the best of times, it's not the worst of times. It sure ain't Dickens. It would be better to rent than to buy."
2,Irritating,"Mr.Right is a story of looking for ""that one"" - a second half, a love of your life, etc.(choose the right one).We meet a gang of gays and one fag hag. All of them are looking and looking and...With better or worse result.After I watched the movie I was really torn. It is not a low budget production, so the picture and sound are good.The acting is not bad either...It must be the plot and the characters. As a viewer I couldn't associate myself with any of the characters. There is a male h***ker, and a sad, ugly fag who must pay him to have sex (both annoying like hell). We have one gay father who is terrorised by his own kiddo, another camp who cannot shut up for a single minute (every moment this one appeared on the screen I felt like throwing sth at the tv) and another who is ""an soap actor"".With such bunch of ""interesting"" characters I couldn't wait to see the end titles.Better to rent, than to buy."
3,good move for a slow sunday afternoon,British accent is a bit difficult to keep up with at times. All in all a good movie that gets you involved emotionally and intellectually with the characters.
2,Mr. Who or What!,"I am so Thankful this film came on Sundance for had it not I would have made the error in buying it for my collection. Really there was what could have been a ""real story"" here but that did not happend. Instead the director took this film on what seemed to be a if you will ""trip"". It went here, there, everywhere, leaving you saying what the heck is this so called film I'm watching. Then the so called female friend still doesn't know the difference between a gay man & a straight man with all the gay men she is surrounded by. Please if ""anything"" rent this film do not buy it. If someone elese were to take and rewrite this script it would be a great story and done without spending a ton of money as well. Simply the director failed at telling any kind of story here. If your bored or a lazy Sunday afternoon take a peak but remember even if it's a lazy afternoon you can not get back the lazy time you gave up by watching this film.Peace & Blesssings,Hope This Helps someone from buying."
5,Awesome-ness !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the best non fiction books I have ever read. The author's writing style is easy to follow and her details drag you into the story effortlessly. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys scary family history. If you have ever felt that YOU have had a weird family then read this book, be ready to be proved wrong.This is an excellent book, I have already read it three times, and I can't wait for number two. Great job Jackie!"
4,A Truly Unique Memoir,"A sometimes frightening, sometimes poignant tale of growing up poor in upstate New York. I'm not sure which was more terrifying, the paranormal events that plagued the author and her family or the real life cruelty inflicted on them by family and friends. A thoroughly fascinating book!"
5,Very well written and a true scary book,I have read the book and I think it's worth every penny. I believe your story Jackie. It's a shame how people become very envious when something happens good for a family member. A message to the woman Judy who wrote something negative...if your not a family member then you should mind your own business. You remind me of a person who has so much stuff in her closet that you have to talk bad about someone else. GET A LIFE!
1,Check Your Facts With Your Family Relatives First,"What member of the family did u live in. Your parents must be ashamed of such a book that u don't have the FACTS. Such a book of Lies,Decete of what was true. Check with current Family members still living and u see a True picture. Some of them still live in the house and area today. The house is well and standing on a firm ground. Noone in the family is cursed or are or have had any troubles. What a Dream World the author thinks she lived in.. DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.........."
4,"Just an old fashioned oil filter cartridge, OK","Not much to say. Fram puts in every type of gasket used in every application of this old oil filter cartridge that can be imagined. Installed it in a 1954 Ford 600 tractor, used two of the gaskets needed and had four left over to decorate the barn wall with after I hung them on a nail. It was a dollar and a half more than Tractor supply charged for it, but I did not have to go get it or bear the cost of driving to their store. All is well that ends well.Regards, Pag"
3,Mixed review,"This filter came with the required gaskets, plus some extras for various installations, I assume. The end caps were thin paper, and the outer covering was also a very thin paper. Not at all confidence inspiring for something intended to preserve the engine. It was made in Mexico. The Purolator equivalent, L30048 has a metallic construction and looks much sturdier. It was made in India. The only downside is that it did not come with the gasket required under the canister. Maybe that's OK because of the type of seal involved, but it would have been nice to see a replacement."
4,just plain awesome,"My all time favorite tv drama of all time. The first 2 seasons are just spectacular - and goes downhill from there but never the less provides for hours of entertainment. Relationship between christian and sean is outstanding and is engaging to watch with all the drama surrounding them.Some episodes keep you glued to your seat, and others are just OK. If you have never seen this on TV - I would advise picking this up. This was a must for my dvd collection"
5,Very Pleased,"I was very pleased with this item. I got it for wicked cheap, and it cost me a lot less money that trying to purchase each one individually. My gf had seasons 1 and 2 but wanted the rest of them. Well this ended up being the way to go, so in the end I will have her give away the other 2 seasons, and I can't wait to see her face on christmas morning when she gets this one!!"
5,Excellent!,"Great serie! And the box set is very nice. I have not finished looking, but what I saw was very good"
2,Worst purchase...,"Like other posters who didn't like the functionality I'm going to have to agree! Its very hard to use, and the menus are worthless. I won't say any more since others have said it better, and I agree 100% with their anaylsis of the problem.Another problem that I've had that people haven't mentioned was when I'm on my bike, or other exercises it stops and starts for no reason! I could be going 17mph and the thing just stops in the middle of a flat. I'm pedaling, my HR is going...it shouldn't stop. Because of this, sometimes I don't notice its stopped and I don't start it again for a few tenths of a mile later and then my mileage is off. I have done everything under the sun to try and remedy the problem, but to no avail.I want to get something else, like a Forerunner or Edge, but don't have the $$ to spend so I'm stuck with this POS.Seriously, I expected more from a Polar..."
2,Not an effective study guide!,"Everybody learns differently, so this book might work for you. However, I read the first two chapters, and never opened it again. The NCE exam is a multiple choice exam... this book's fill in the blank and short essay style questions absolutely did not help me prepare for the NCE. The fill in the blank questions were extremely picky at a level of detail not on the actual NCE (I took it April 16.) Yet, the ""summaries"" offered in each chapter did not cover a large portion of the material covered in my Masters counseling program. I also found it to be a boring read, worse than most textbooks. Buy the Encyclopedia of Counseling instead!"
5,Illustrated children's book,"This is a classic Japanese legend, which is told with illustrations from an old scroll. The illustrations are wonderful, and the story is a lot of fun."
2,"Does the job, not well","For the price it is hard to complain, but this case has a few critical flaws. The primary flaw is that the case covers the iPhone's proximity sensor. This sensor turns off the screen while you are on a call holding the phone to your ear. With the sensor blocked, your ear is free to trigger all sorts of commands and you will get frequent rogue calls. The other failing with this case is that there is no hole for headphone use. To use this case properly with an iPhone would require removal of the phone from the case each time you made a call, or listened to music. It may be possible to fix this with some careful cutting."
4,Just what it says,"cant complain just what it says it is. not the best skin out there but the very best ive seen for the price, and it does not fall off."
4,Easy Reference for Historical Speeches,Especially like for easy access to verify comments made in history. Helpful when trying to verify and strengthen a viewpoint.
2,Handsome but derivative and redundant exhibition and catalogue,"There are lots of pretty pictures here and I'm sure it all looks fetching in the museum galleries, but this catalogue offers absolutely nothing of any import for the art historian or serious art enthusiast. I understand that an overview approach is appealing and appropriate for an exhibition of American art in England -- the show opened in February at the National Gallery in London -- but there is no excuse for rehashing old scholarship. Work on American artists in Paris has been done, several times over, by the same scholars who appear in this catalogue. Specifically, Barbara Weinberg's excellent work in The Lure of Paris (1991), William Gerdts's book on Monet's Giverny (1993), and Annette Blaugrund's crucial Paris 1889: American Artists at the Universal Exposition (1989) amply address most of the territory covered here."
2,Too Elementary,"The project was cute but did not have enough data on the original way theorems were done and how to make a stencil, etc. I expected more more than one small project. Though I was very disappointed, but I did learn something."
4,Excellent pictorial catalog of inner city decay and rebirth,"This is an excellent book for high school students living in the inner city. We have incorporated this book as part of our curriculum in the Urban Design Studio Project, which is a after school program that introduces high school students living inthe South Bronx to careers in urban planning and architectural studies. Although much has changed in the South Bronx, we still suffer the stigma of a ghetto I believe a second book is in order to show the major changes which have occured since the books publication. There is hope and people by far have improved their living and social economic conditions."
5,Resident Evil Trilogy Pack Blu-Ray,"If you like the Resident Evil movies and you love Blu-Ray, then this is the collection for you. All the films look very good in Blu-Ray and I recommend it as an upgrade for the old DVDs or if you've been wanting to buy them anyway."
5,One of my favs,A must have for any Zombie enthusiast. Love any story with a strong woman who kicks butt. Quality was perfect and cover was like new.
4,A solid collection,"I haven't watched RE:Extinction yet, but I am quite happy with the picture quality of the blu-ray transfers for RE1 and 2. It's not jaw-droppingly good like Spiderman 3, but they are definitely some of the better looking blus I own. I'm particularly impressed with the details that comes out in the dark sequences in RE1 (which is a lot of the movie). The special features are kind of thin, IMO, but it's better than some (Fifth Element, Black Hawk Down and Kingdom of Heaven, I'm looking at you!). Overall a solid buy, especially given the less than $50 price tag for all three films."
5,excelent product,"The product is excelent, and movies come as they do if you buy them separetly, so you can take them out of the box, and put them right next to your resident evil 4 movie, and your collection will be complete. It is a silly detail, but some people wouldnt like their movies with a sign saying ""trilogy"" knowing there are actually 4 (or even more) movies in the collection.Languages are:REAudio: English, italian, french, spanish and portuguese.Subs: English, french, italian, portuguese and spanishRE: ApocalypseAudio: EnglishSubs English, spanish and portugueseRE: ExtinctionAudio: English, french, spanish and portuguese.Subs: English, french, portuguese, spanish and chineseHope this was useful for everyone."
5,Resident Evil Trilogy,"Great response from the company that I purcahsed this from, it came with a week and I would use them again in the future."
5,Way Better Than Expected!!!,My teen boys are big time Resident Evil Fans and we received a Blu-ray player for Christmas. These movies were on the top of their long list of movies. It was major testosterone & action in my living room for days. Quality movies.
3,"Good action, some great scenes, but didn't blow me away.",This move really felt like a bridge or a link kinda movie. What I mean is that it seems like it was just kind of a filler to get the audience from the movie prior to this to the movie following this. The movie after this one 'Retribution' was phenomenal. Anyway nontheless it was entertaining.
3,so so series,bought to show my buddy before the new films good if you like the series would stay away from them if you dont like any of them
3,Movies,This is a cheaper way to get all the movies on one DVD package. I love this trilogy and am hoping for a 4th.
4,Great movie,"The product was brand new,had a great time watching the movies. IF you are into zombie movies this trilogy is great! Dont forget to follow up with the newer resident evil movies!"
5,UMBRELLA CO.. WATCH OUT ..ALICE IS BACK !!!!,LOVE THIS SERIES OF MOVIES...I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE ALL THREE BUNDLED WITH A FANTASTIC PRICE..I OWN THE 4TH INSTALLMENT SO NOW I HAVE THE ULTIMATE PACKAGE..AFTER WATCHING THE 4TH INSTALLMENT..I BELIEVE THERE IS ROOM FOR A FIFTH MOVIE..I HOPE SO..!!!!
4,"Nice & sharp, some content blanks screen on Samsung BD player","Nicely remastered for all 3 BD's, sharp, great audio for most. Not consistent though. Resident evil had True HD. Apocalypse didn't.Main gripe is some of the bonus content will result in a blank screen (with audio) for about 10 seconds, before the picture appears. This happens on my Samsung BD-C5500."
4,it's good bluray,"The video and audio quality is pretty good. It's a good product in HD. Resident I and III come with audio and subtitles in several languages. Only, Resident II comes with English audio but subtitles in several languages. I expected more extra content.I enjoyed watching them!"
4,Resident Evil Blu Ray Trilogy,"I'll begin by saying that I am a Resident Evil an. So even though all of the movies are low budget, campy, and not so scary, zombie flicks, I can appreciate that. If you like Resident Evil, then Blu Ray does it justice. All three look and sound great, with an emphasis on sound. If you haven't seen any of these, it would be best to rent first, and not start out on amazon.Recommended for the fans."
3,"Instant laughs, just add friends and alcohol ( if over 21, of course).","great Drinking Trilogy to watch.Movie wise, there is alot to be desired. The first's SFX are laughable, a great argument for practical vs CGI effects, anyday of the week. Though its not as bad with the other moviesThe story is pretty nonexistent. Luckily, after the first one they dropped and character development, focused on fighting, sfx and one liners to add to the cheese factor. and stretched out the 25 minutes worth of story to about 100 minutes. Amazingly, by doing this the movies improve, and a march more enjoyable to watch. Running Dialogue with friends is required. I got the boxset when it was 25 bucks deal of the day. And dont feel too ripped off about it. 36 bucks I dont know know though... that might be pushing it....Enjoyable guilty pleasure that improves with each movie. Watch all 3 add friends and beer, instant fun time with lots of laughs."
2,Problems with the spanish,"The product have no problem itself, the problem is the language, the spanish is latin spanish, and is not specified, and in the 2 movie is not possible the spanish language only spanish subtitles."
4,Resident Evil Blu-Ray Trilogy,Resident Evil - The High-Definition Trilogy (Resident Evil/ Resident Evil: Apocalypse/ Resident Evil: Extinction) [Blu-ray] I LOVE THIS SERIES AND I LOVE MILLA. WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. KEEP THEM COMING. I AM THERE.
4,Resident Evil Trilogy (Blu-ray),"I have always liked the Resident Evil movies. Now that they are on Blu-ray, all the better. This is a trilogy of the first three and I like it a bunch. What a deal."
5,Amazing Value,"I've been a resident evil fan since I've played it on playstation 1 I really like the films a lot. I bought these when they were only 25 bucks was such a great value, and I love Milla so much shes amazing total bada** can't wait for more resident evil films and games to come out highly recammend this trilogy as a re or zombie fan."
4,Resident evil blu-ray trilogy,awesome movies for any fan of the zombie genre or for any fan of the resident evil video games quality is excellent and the movies keep me entertained time and time again i highly recommend this trilogy
3,Disappointed,I bought this set to replace my DVD set. I actually like my DVD's better. The Blu-ray's picture doesn't look any better to me. Also my DVD's sound better. If you have these on DVD just keep what you got!
4,Great for Fans,"Three movies, one box. Very enjoyable. My only real complaint is the box in itself is a bit lacking (just three disks, no insert or additional literature) and that the disks are arranged a bit awkwardly (Extinction is on one side, first two movies are overlapped on the other). If you are a RE fan, I highly recommend it."
2,Disappointing,After thoroughly enjoying all the predecessor films in this franchise I was very disappointed in the quality of the story line in this latest installment. The entire movie seemed to be written to successfully translate to video game format rather than to do justice to the Resident Evil family of films.
5,"Everything I expected it to be, can watch it over and over !!","I'm a Resident Evil fanatic, so I had to order this instead of having to keep begging to borrow my son's copy of it. Not to mention, it was a must for my ""in the making"" DVD collection hobby I seem to have started. I have to admit that I can watch every one of these movies over and over again and still manage to find something I missed from all the other times I've watched them !!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying the trilogy if you really liked the first movie. The next 3 movies will not disapoint, only leave you wanting more.........."
4,Great series,"Nothing much to say that hasn't been said, EXCEPT not only does the series have Milla, BUT the extraordinarily talented and wonderful SIENNA GUILLORY in the second film. Biff, Bang, Pow!"
4,great dvds i am a fan of the zombie movies,these dvds arrived in a descent amount of time and quality is very good. i like the way they all came in one box also.
4,Resident Evil,This trilogy was delivered very timely and the movies themselves were what I expected. Have watched all three and am completely satisfied.
4,A good addition,I purchased these for my collection. They make a decent addition. The story line gets a tad boring after the second DVD but It makes for a great sleeping pill. I would not hesitate to purchase these again if necessary. But once is enough with all the other thrillers out there.
3,Families of Ballyrashane,"Missing a few pages, as stated, turned out to be about 50 pages, but otherwise in excellent condition."
1,don't buy it,Broke after 3 months. Took me hours to fill out replacement requests. It is just not worth it. I will never try this brand any more.
1,WASTE OF TIME,I BOUGHT A CD BURNER THROUGH AMAZON BUT THE MACHINE IS NOT WORKING AT ALL SO I HAVE WASTED A LOT OF TIME BY TRYING TO BUY A CHEAP PRODUCT SO MY RECOMMENDATION TO EVERYBODY IS NOT TO BUY USED ARTICLES.
4,almost perfect,"Pros: leak-proof, keeps hot coffee hot for a long time, looks great.Cons: cannot open to drink with one hand, opening not big enough to clean interior well."
2,A few design glitches,"The mug is excellent at maintaining the temperature and doesn't leak when in transport. However, because of the small opening it is difficult to drink out of and difficult to clean. Need to take the top completely off to drink or it may leak (only when you least expect it.) Then, when you get to the bottom of the cup you need to tip your head way back to get the last few sips. The two O-rings that keep it from leaking in transport come off a bit too easily and are just waiting to get lost. I expect the mug will have a short use life because of this."
4,Luv the Mugs!,"My husband and I love these mugs. We've been using them for about a year and they're great. They retain the liquid's temperature for hours and are comfortable to drink from. They don't leak. We've put them through a lot, taking them camping, kayaking, and in the car when we run errands. I would give them 5 stars, but they squeak a little when opening and closing the top to take a drink. Not a big deal, though. I recommend the mugs!"
3,Nice but not forever.,"Bought two of these mugs for traveling to put coffee into and for filling with ice and water to use as a bedside cup. They kept the hot things hot and the cold things cold better than any other thermos I had ever had and I was extremely pleased with the thermal quality of the product. Unfortunately, they don't fit into the cup holder in the car and the plastic/rubber bottom has to be removed in order to stand it upright. Then to my dismay after less that 2 years one of the mugs lost its thermal quality. The outside sweats and the ice melts in just a few hours, where as prior to this time the ice used to remain frozen for over 12 hours. I am going to try another Thermos product and hope for better luck this time."
2,This was great until...,I lost the small inner washer. It must have fallen out at some point. I am not sure why its not attached but its not. Once it was misplaced the travel mug was useless. I loved it until then but its hard to recommend this item when a small piece of it is so easily removed and can render the item useless.I ended up going back to my old Starbucks mug.
4,A great mug,Have had the first mug they made for the last 30 years. Thought I would replace it and am very happy with the new one. It should out last me if it's anything like the old one.
5,"What, hot coffee after 6 hours?","It is 11:56am as I write this review, and my coffee, which was poured at 6:45 this morning, is STILL HOT! This cup is amazing. I gave my girlfriend a list of 3 factors that I needed satisfied in a mug.1. No leaking2. Keeps coffee Hot3. No handleTrue, this mug only satisfies 2 of the three, but it does that ridiculously well! I commute 1 hour each way on the bus, and my mug doesn't leak even jostled around in my purse! I love the way that it keeps my coffee hot all day. So much so that my coworkers make fun of the fact that I am still drinking coffee at 2pm in the afternoon!!This is a great gift for the coffee drinker in your life."
1,"it leaks, always has","I have had this thing for several years. It does keep the coffee hot/warm, for a long period of time. Unless the design has changed, there is nothing to keep from leaking if it is tipped.This item CAN NOT BE CARRIED in a bag or even knocked over. In addition, it is difficult to keep clean."
2,Poor design,"When this mug works, it works well. Keeps drinks hot for a reasonable length of time and doesn't leak.But that bit about ""not leaking"" is the problem. On the lid there are two, silicone O-Rings. The smaller of the two slips off and gets lost very, very easily. Once you lose that, it leaks when tipped. And since the base is too big to fit into a car cupholder, there's no way to carry it w/o getting your coffee everywhere - you basically have to throw it away. This has happened to me twice, and I'm not buying one of these again..."
3,Not Leak Proof What Goes?,"I purchased this travel mug thinking it would be the last one i'd ever have to purchase. Couldn't seem to find one that DID NOT LEAK, unfortunately this one LEAKS TOO. What goes? I read the reviews before I made my purchase thinking i've finally found the right travel mug that will keep things hot and not leak all over the place.....It does keep the coffee hot i have to say that much but for leakability, it sucks and for that reason may be returned...Very unhappy..."
1,"Loved it till the ""rubber"" rings came off","For a few glorious weeks, it was the Holy Grail of travel mugs.After a month of use, it started dribbling coffee onto my clothes. A stranger at a conference saw me using this mug gingerly, and we commiserated. There are rubber-like gaskets that must be in place in 2 spots to keep mug from leaking. Rings came off within a month; big surprise. We had recommended the mug to friends; some lost the gaskets entirely before they knew rings had detached. I see now that my experience was not unique. I always washed by hand, so that is not the problem.Do I want to CrazyGlue the gaskets to the plastic, and continue to drink hot coffee or tea? Not worth the time and trouble to return, and you don't buy a replacement if the first one has flaws. But it was such a GOOOD mug for those days......"
1,Leak-proof my @$$.,"Cons:- This never seemed to insulate nearly as well as the old thermos mug it was meant to replace.- The tiny mouth of the thing made it hard to add ice cubes, etc. Pretty frustrating.- Started leaking heavily through the ""leak-proof"" 360 drink lid opening after just a few days of use.- The fins around the bottom of the mug for ""stability"" seem to make it less stable on most surfaces, and are generally more annoying than useful.Pros:- It looks knind of cool, I guess.- Free carabiner and open handle make it easy to clip to your belt or your pack so you can slosh your beverage all over yourself when the ""leak-proof"" lid fails. If you're into that sort of thing. If not you might want to move this ""feature"" up to the 'Cons"" list."
5,Enjoy Hot Coffee? Then this is the Mug For you!,"I absolutely LOVE this mug. I am very particular when it comes to my coffee. If it isn't hot I am not happy! As long as I keep the cover completely sealed, this mug will keep my coffee hot for hours on end even in the dead of winter when I might accidentally leave it in my cold, parked car. I also love the fact that I am able to twist open the cover and drink from any angle. The handle on the the mug is extremely handy and a must for me."
5,Best office mug ever,"I love this mug. It doesn't taste like metal and it keeps tea warm for hours. I agree with the other review that the biggest danger is burning your lips. I put an ice cube in and then close it up, and then the temperature is just right. Plus it's sturdy and doesn't tip over. This mug doesn't work in the car -- too big and you have to lean your head too far back for the second half. But it's the best mug I've ever had at work."
3,Good travel mug,"Well made mug, really spillproof.I took two stars off the qualification because when you take the lid off, the opening is terribly small and it is awkward and VERY difficult to get ice inside."
5,Hot coffee for 4 hours!!!,"This is by far the absolute BEST coffee travel mug I have ever owned. On Christmas morning after I opened it up, I poured some pipping hot coffee in it.. Then I got busy and forgot all about it for 3 hours... I went back took a sip, and it was HOT.. I mean real HOT!! It was amazing. I was so happy, I carried it with me all day. It fits right in our car cup holders with ease. I cannot say enough great things about this travel mug. Thermos GOT IT RIGHT!! Its the one that DOES NOT LEAK.. NOT EVEN A DROP! If you need a travel mug for your drink, buy this one.. it is worth EVERY penny. I am so happy. I bought 2 of these. One for myself, and one for my wife. I will buy 2 more and pack them away.Jason in Cornelius Oregon"
5,Back for one more,"I'm buying a second one -- I LOVE THIS MUG! Coffee still too hot to drink, even three hours later. Spill-proof, nice to drink from, handy handle. Perfect."
5,This is truly leak-proof and keeps coffee hot for hours,I don't often give things five stars but this is awesome. Keeps coffee hot for over two hours (not just warm but HOT). It is truly leak proof as well. Have had it for a few months.
4,Perfect for Travel,"This is a great mug for anyone who travels. It keeps the drinks hot or cold for hours and the top doesn't let anything out until you want to!The opening at the top of this mug is a little small (typical spoons may not fit in to stir your drink) but you just use a knife or swirl it around and it's set for the day on the move.I have learned to wait a few minutes after filling it to put the top on otherwise the drink is liable to scald your tongue, but I consider a mug that keeps a drink too hot a good thing!"
4,great mug,"I've had this meg for well over one year and it literally has been all over the world with me. Despite taking quite the beating and multiple falls, the mug still functions just as it did on the day I got it. And it really DOES NOT LEAK at all. I would highly recommend it if someone needs something that is absolutely leak proof.PROS:-Durable-Leak proof-Looks nice-Handle is very convenient to hang mug on things-Base is very stable-Easy to clean (can pull rubber gaskets off and clean individually)-Can clean in dishwasherCONS:-Takes two hands to open (I work in a hospital so have to be very careful not to touch the actual rim with my hands when twisting the top open)-Opening beneath top, as others mention, is rather small; but this makes spills from tipping sideways less likely if you forget to twist shut the top"
5,Best Travel Mug I've owned,"I've had quite a few travel mug. So far, this is the best that I've ever had. FIrst of all, it keeps the coffee hot for quite a while. I would say, it stays warm enough to be pleasant around 5 hours. Also, how hot it stays depends on how often you open it. The second reason I love this mug is it is super simple to clean. There is nowhere for the coffee to get trapped and fester. It's also really simple to put together. Lastly, it's really easy to tell if it's open or not. I love this thing."
3,Great until it proves not unbreakable,"I researched for a good coffee thermos, to use as a carafe and travel mug. The Thermos e5 got great reviews and lived up to its reputation. It kept coffee hot for 5-6 hours until it was opened. Once I started to pour, the coffee cooled off.However, I tended to drop it, partly because the carabiner kept pulling the rubber grip off the handle. (Glue didn't work. The fix was to spread the prongs of the handle so they pressed against the slots in the grip.) I must have dropped it one too many times, because it lost its ability to hold in the heat. There was no leak, so I'm guessing the thermal isolation suspension system was crushed or cracked.Anyway, I'm buying a new one."
5,The best insulated mug I've used,Holds temps longer than any others I've tried.....bomb-proof!Be careful not to lose the gaskets in the dishwasher is only issue.Will buy a couple more to keep handy!
2,Coffee/Tea Mug,"Cons: My previous Nissan mug held heat for over 24 hrs. -- this does not. But what I dislike the most is that it has only a small opening at top, so I must buy a bottle brush to clean inside.Pro: Like the handle."
5,Best ever but don't dish wash!,"I use this for Hot drinks (Coffee) only. I sip on the same 16 oz of coffee all day long. When you pour hot coffee right from the pot it will stay ultra hot all day long. If it is too hot for you, simply open the lid a bit and it will cool off some. I will sometimes fill it with hot water and let it sit until the coffee brews and this seems to make it last even longer.I have owned one of these for at least a year and have dropped it on pavement numerous times. It's 100 % tough. I started washing it in the dishwasher because of pure laziness and after a month or two it was ruined and would no longer hold the heat. I'm an idiot and now I'm paying for it cause I'm shelling out another 30 + bucks for a new one.Truth be told, it is worth the $$ because it is durable and effective."
1,Thermos E10500 16-Ounce Leak-Proof Travel Mug,This is NOT leak proof. I'm on my second one and after about two weeks of use the mug leaks from the top.
4,rating of this book,I would gladly rate the product with the stars as I have done buy I resent the need to makeup some prose.
4,Much better than the first!,"Have you read ""Man of My Dreams"" yet? If not then you should because it sets up this book but don't expect to have nearly as much fun because in my opinion ""Love Me Forever"" is ten times better! I adored Lachlan as soon as he was introduced back in MOMD fawning over Megan. In fact, I actually hoped he'd end up with her instead of Devlin (who appears COMPLETELY different in this novel than the first. He's actually likeable here, he was a jerk in MOMD). Who wouldn't adore Lachlan? He and Kimber make such a perfect pair! I highly recommend this book! Only read MOMD if you really want background information because otherwise you'll probably just get a headache and fall asleep. Stick with the loveable Scot Lachlan! You'll enjoy yourself much more!"
3,Mmmmmmkay,"I think the title of the review sums it up best.It was just Mmmmmm kay.Frankly, Kimberly ""Kimber"" is a lukewarm, mild, kinda boring heroine. She's got a wee bit of a temper, is taller than most romance heroines, but is otherwise completely ordinary.Lachlan seems like a bit of a dolt-and the painted picture of him on the inside flap of the novel is a bit steroidal. Not to mention the fact that he looks like 10 years older than the actual character.And the sex scenes are really dull IMHO."
3,An average romance story.,"This is a typical romance type book. It is good but nothing out of the ordinary. If you are like me and go through books like water, this book is worth reading. However, for those who have limited time or are wanting something Great, it might be better to pick out something else."
1,"Total Nonsense, sub-par effort by a good romance writer","While reading this book, i really was wondering, what kind of a joke the author pulls on her readers. Even though the novel seems to fall into the historic romance category, it is totally anachronistic, with totally unbelievable relationships within and among the english/scottish societal classes. Nevertheless, it carries the reader with itself, as most of JL work does. The authors slopinness would have been okay, if she'd created a fresh and intricate plot, however the story is very predictable too. All in all, when reading this, you might find not a guilty pleasure, but a pleasure of a duped."
1,Everyone DOES NOT love a Lindsey,"This is the second book of Lindsey's I have read. As usual with her books, the plot summary on the cover sounds very interesting--but the characters aren't very complex and complications are solved very quickly and neatly. This one is better than most--the characters at least have a bit of humor about them, and the sex scenes aren't badly written--but the secondary characters, espcially, are VERY weak; annoying cardboard cutouts who are ovbiously there to further some plot contrivance. Very lightweight stuff."
4,Humorous and a delight to read,"This is just about my favorite JL book. The characters of Kimberly and Lachlan have great chemistry. I truly did believe, in the end, that they were made for each other. It's very romantic and Lachlan is definetly one of those fish that most women would find a lot of difficulty in tossing back into the sea. But that didn't stop Kimberly from trying. Kimberly has a lot of spunk and Lachlan is just too wicked by half. I can say that he has become my paragon of male masculinity. I was sorry that the book ended. I would have liked to see the two of them continue to fight it out (albeit in the most charming fashion) a little more. Regretfully, the minor characters in this book were too much of a distraction. I would have liked to see Kimberly and Lachlan cross swords a little more before they settled down and I would have enjoyed seeing Kimberly a bit less corporative just to make things more difficult for Lachlan. It's just a great book! Read it!!!! :-)"
3,A Little Dry,"Okay, maybe I wasn't caught up by this novel because I have yet to read Man Of My Dreams. I just thought everything going on between Lachlan and Kimber lacked a lot of action and passion, though it was beautifully told. I did find it nice to see that, although Kimberly was not as overbearingly attractive as her hostess (Lachlan's fantasy woman), her man found perfect love and perfect beauty in her."
3,Love Me Forever,"The book was an easy read but I found that it was less engaging than Man of My Dreams, the first book in the Sherring Cross Series. The characters were interesting and the tie-in to the previous book was obvious. I expected more creativity."
3,Nothing New.....,"This book was bland. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good. It was simply bland. The story didn't really have anything intresting happen. No big crisis or argument. There was one thing I didn't really like, when Lachlan gets into Kimberly's bed only about 2 days after they'd met and Kimberly not actually realizing what was happening. To me, that just isn't romantic. But then, that's just my personal opinion."
2,Good but not Great,I was a little disappointed with this book from Ms. Lindsey. I usually read her books at least twice but I could not bring myself to read this one again. I expected more.
3,"Not as good as ""A Land Remembered""","""The River is Home"" is very ""Yearling""-esque and a good study of life on the bayou many years ago. The end seemed to simply trail off, leaving me a little unsatisfied. ""Angel City"" was good, but the situation the family was in was frustrating and made me angry, so it accomplished its purpose well."
1,The work of a sexual deviant!,"I am sure that Phlap Apirak is one of Kim's many aliases. The content and style of writing are remarkably similar to that of Heerak Christian Kim. I find it appalling that men such as Christian Kim can exploit women for sexual pleasure, financial gain and write a satirical book about such activities. Is there any depth to which Kim won't stoop? I do hope that Phlap/Kim is caught by the Thai authorities and brought to justice. Please do not support the prostitution trade by buying this disgusting book."
3,A Good fictional historical overview,"This book is a lot like Dick Gledhill's One Commando. It's fiction based on reality. What the book does is give the reader an idea on how the ZANLA/ZIPRA terrorists recruited by force and fear. It really gives you a simplisitc picture of how terrorists were recruited, fought and in many cases fell into something they weren't necessarily 100% behind. I have seen a quote in a book that said ""The Rain Goddess was the way the war (in Rhodesia) was."" I don't know if it was or not, but the book is mildly entertaining and fairly informative. I wouldn't reccomend the high price usually attached to this book, but if you're interested in the Rhodeisan Bush War, you might find this entertaining."
4,Great Book - Would Recommend,This was a well layed out book. It will easily help you cook a weeks worth of meals in one afternoon and you are all set for the week. The shopping lists attached are also great.I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have all the time in the world to cook every day! It will make your weekly life easier.
5,Hot new Argentinan singer! Buy this CD!,"Just got this CD in Buenos Aires - she's got a top ten hit currently (Luna Bonita) and was voted Argentina's best new artist last year. Highly recommend this CD - terrific vocal range, beautiful lyrics, beautiful music. Not too bad lookin' either. :-)"
1,hard cheap color pencils,Hard cheap color pencils is what i can describe these pencils to be. over rated by an art teacher. expensive!
5,Another Fantastic Devlin Dynasty Book,"This book is part of the Devlin Dynasty series (Jaci Burton's Werewolf series) and also part of the Storm of all Season series. Jaci Burton brings not only these two series together in one book, but also two wonderful characters that you will fall in love with. Their love story is so powerful and fascinating that you won't get enough of this book. The book is a real keeper that you don't wanna miss!"
4,Good storyline....,"I liked this book fine, it's not going to go on my keeper shelf or anything, but all in all a good quick read. Shannon is likeable enough though a bit too stubborn. Max is a great character with an abundance of patience when dealing with Shannon. The meet, sparks fly, she is in denial because she's afraid of loosing who she is. Hence ensues the wooing and winning of Shannon by Max. Good installment in the series."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I was so happy to find this bag and I was looking forward to getting it, unfortunately MyBeauty charged my credit card for it, and the very next day they sent me a refund for it. Their excuse was due to the incredible demand for this bag and they could not fill out my order. If they did not have this item in stock anymore, why didn't they just posted that on their site? I will be very cautious when purchasing from them. Very unreliable."
5,Good Book,"This story is one of the Cinderella tales however this one is from Mexico. A young girl goes and cooks for the governor, and the governor is amazed by the taste of the meals that this girl can cook. However Domitila's mother dies and she must return home. The prince wanting to taste the wonderful food again goes out and searches for the woman who can cook a feast out of weeds. Although the governor faces some hardships and dishonest people in the end finds Domitila and marries her. This is a wonderful take off of the classic Cinderella story. I like it because it has Mexican traditions in it and the illustrations are wonderful. This book would be great to use as an introduction to different cultures. If I were to use this in my classroom I would try to get other countries versions of Cinderella so that they children could see even more differences and similarities in the stories."
1,This movie is awful.,"Neverending Story, a title that in and of itself virtually guarantees endless sequels, was great, a true classic. Neverending Story 2 not so much; Neverending Story 3 is crap. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it's the last sequel (as of April 2011).A Wrinkle in Time I have not seen but if it's packaged with Neverending Story 3 I would have low expectations. Caveat emptor."
2,Doesn't work for me,"The light-weight foam collapses from the weight of my top leg from 3.25"" to around an 1"" (i am 6' 175) so that the space is no longer optimal. The velcro strap can accommodate a ""knee"" in up to a 26"" in circumference so when you adjust it for a normal knee there is lots of strap flapping about and very little velcro fastener overlap.I've gone back to a pillow."
1,Get what you pay for!,This is a small little square of foam with a velcro strap to go around your leg. This is a big joke. These type of products need to be tried on back surgery patients first. If they work for them then they would work for all. Memory foam ones don't work either. You need a sturdy foam contour one. It is hard trying to find one that works is expensive and hard to do. So I am off to find another one to try. LOL
2,not satisfied,"The strap doesn't keep it in place very well, and if you need to get up during the night, it doesn't hold it on your leg at all. Its too thick for my comfort."
1,Not worth $5,"I wanted something that would freeze my hair in place, like the canister says. Well, I did not get it here. I use hairspray for volume, and after spraying, waiting, spraying again, etc., I got nothing from this product except a clumpy crown of hair. This has got 2b the worst product I have tried. Maybe this is nice for spraying your ponytail into place; I expected something more than that."
4,Too strong,"Got2b glued is really strong so when you use for something you absolutely HAVE to shower after and use A LOT of shampoo. I used this product for a cheerleading competition to keep my hair in a ponytail and it stayed REALLY well but I HAD to shower after to get everything out otherwise when you take the ponytail out it stays in a ponytail. other than showering afterwards it is a GREAT product. Yes, i recommend it if you don't mind showering after every use of this product."
4,Learning How to Use It,"I have made several attempts to spike my hair, but it continues to fall. My daughter is going to help me get it right. Can't wait for the finall results!"
3,24x36 filter,"Unfortunately this size air filter is is hard to find in stores, so even buying them on-line can get pricey. Quality air filter for price is poor."
4,Great!,"It's really good! I've been on the honor roll since 4th grade, and some of the questions manage to stump me. The lessons are very detailed, and easy to understand. The science cd made stuff I don't think my parents even know cool!"
4,such fun !,"Pure unadultrated disco for the soul ! Baccara unfortunately never made it big as the others in the scene, but their heavily accented, campy lyrics and upbeat disco makes u wanna smile and go back to the disco days !check out their 'yes, sir i can boogie', 'parlez vous francias, 'granada' amongst others and rejoice"
2,Yes sir i can boogie,For the teenage generation of 1978's - 1980's . good music if you liked Baccara and the accent !
5,VW Passat Stereo antenna adapter,Worked great and at a price better than I could have driven somewhere to get. Saved money and time with only a few minutes spent on the computer.
2,Paintings in the Hermitage,"Took a very long time for delivery, almost the whole time allotted. Quality was very poor. Bindings where coming loose. Extra page had been glued in front and back to hold bindings together."
2,Lots of content but badly edited,"I purchased this book because it had a section on Hybrid Monte Carlo and I was looking for something longer and more recent than Radford Neal's well-known paper on the subject.The HMC portion of the book was pretty thorough but riddled with spelling and grammatical errors in the text, enough that I became suspicious that this was a draft that had seen only one or two casual QA/editing passes. That led me to suspect there might be errors in the math, which drive me crazy -- nothing frustrates me more than spending a lot of time trying to understand a set of equations before realizing there's a typo in them.If you're looking for a book that covers a topic that others don't, it's probably worth getting, especially if you're really comfortable with the math, but I wouldn't recommend as a general introduction to Monte Carlo methods."
4,An awesome book on Monte Carlo methods,"Now, I am reading this book. I would like to mark it 4.5 stars if possible.[1] The author is an expert of computational statistics and Bayesian analysis, an active mathematician at Harvard.[2] The background of this book is related to bioinformatics, physics, etc, which puzzles me a lot while reading.[3] You can find the author's deep understanding of MC methods throughout the book.[3] It is suitable for the graduate students of statistics.[4] It's a little bit pity that this book is not purely written for mathematicians. Anyway, it is a witness of MC methods in development."
4,Good purchase,My husband is always working in the basement on the hard concrete. He contantly complains that his feet hurt. I bought these mats for him and he really likes them. They are easy to move around and place in different areas and configurations to fill his needs. They are much better than the cardboard that he was standing on. We would recommend these to anyone with the same issue.
4,Lethal Lies,"After a fatal gamble ends Chelsea Logan's investigation and life, her cousin, Faith is called back to the ""hick"" town in which they both grew up, ostensibly to take over the care of Chelsea's daughter, Jessie. However, the loose ends Chelsea left in the air demand that she do more. Knowing her cousin would not kill herself, Faith searches for the truth behind Chelsea's death, which places her in the same danger her kinswoman was in before her murder. Racism, drugs, and scandal form a web of danger that entangles not only Faith, but Jessie and police chief, Ty Savage, a man Faith has loved on some level for decades.**** From beginning to end, this suspense filled book will draw you in, forcing you to race to the conclusion and the surprise ending. Well developed, complex characterization enhances a seamless plot; things we can rely on from this author. ****"
2,Too old and outdated to be helpful,"Residential treatment for children has changed drastically in the last 30 years. Concepts in this book are old and outdated, especially now when funding for out of home treatment barely exiists."
1,Bias Reporting,Ms. Milton has written an interesting book that to the uninformed may seem much better than it actually is. She has been wowed by the FBI and without an idea as to where she was going the FBI would never have given her so much help. You must read Altered Evidence by James D. Sanders before drawing any conclusions as to the factuality of this book.
3,A lot of questions,"This book, although well written, still leaves too many unanswered questions. Ms. Milton has done her homework as far as the research aspect of her book. ""Altered Evidence"" by James Sanders should also be read to cover another point of view -- the 2 books give different opinions -- by reading both the reader can draw his/her own conclusions.To the reader from Bradford, PA : a C-140 (USAF designation) is a Lockheed JetStar."
4,Terrific book!,"The beginning of this book was very graphic and gory so it was somewhat interesting to me. I couldn't put the book down. The book just kept getting better and better. But the thing is, when a tragedy like this happens, it really makes you feel for the families that suffered. Especially after the tragedy at the Farmer's Market in Santa Monica which hit pretty close to home, I wanted to help out (donate blood) just like the community did in In the Blink of an Eye. When the plane first went down, people went out on their boats, helping pick up the bodies. And in the end the families tried to get the Death on the High Seas Act passed. Now I'm starting to babble... But anyways, it was a great book, and I highly recommend it!"
1,"A DIFFICULT READ-""FICTION!!""","FIRST, I AM AN ARMY VET AND A RETIRED MAJOR AIRLINE EMPLOYEE WITH OVER 36 YEARSSERVICE. I WAS ALSO TRAINED IN EMERGENCY/CRASH RESPONSE. I AM NO EXPERT, BUT I'MALSO NOBODY'S FOOL.I WAS ON VACATION WHEN THIS HAPPENED, AND FOLLOWED IT FROM THE BEGINNING. I READ THE BOOK WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. A VERY DIFFICULT READ WITH THE MANY CHARACTERS ANDWITNESSES INVOLVED. MANY OF THE WITNESSES WERE ACTIVE MILITARY, ESPECIALLY MILITARY PILOTS, AND ALL SEEMED CREDITABLE. MOST OF THEM REPORTED SEEING THE SAME SCENARIO.IN MY OPINION, THE BOOK, WHILE INTERESTING, WAS A MAJOR GOVERNMENT COVER UP FORAN ATTACK ON AMERICA BY RADICALS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ITINVOLVED OUR NAVY FLEET HAVING MANEUVERS IN THE AREA. IT WAS A MISSILE THAT BROUGHTDOWN TWA 800, PLAIN AND CLEAR.READ THE BOOK CAREFULLY, AND FORM YOUR OWN OPINION. DO YOU REALLY TRUST YOURFEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANYMORE? I DON'T!!"
2,"If she wanted to write a novel, she should have.","At best, a ""C."" The author seems to have wanted to write a novel and took ""facts"" and wound them about to create one. Of concern are the inaccuracies I discovered.1. The P3 is not piloted by a captain, at most the pilot is a Lt. Commander and usually a Lt. or Lt. j.g. The P3 does not have the capability to carry or use air-to-air missles and is usually equipped with sonabouys and/or anti-submarine torpedoes. The only missle it can use is an air-to-ground (""air to dirt"") missle.2. There is no C140 cargo aircraft is US inventory. There are C130s, C135s, C141s, C5s, but no 140s.With these errors I wonder what else is wrong. Take a look at the photo of the author and the ""hero"" on the back of the dust cover. She is in awe of the guy. Take more than a grain of salt with this one, bring the shaker."
1,Excellent work of fiction,"Milton's revisionist treatment of the testimony of the two most credible eyewitnesses is telling. She says that Fred ""Fritz"" Meyer of the Air National Guard ""did not suggest that he had seen a missile..."" which is nonsense. First of all she never interviewed him. Second of all, he is on the record stating flatly that what he saw was a missile. (Actually two missiles.) A Viet Nam era pilot, he also has stated unequivocally that he *knows* what a missile flying through the air looks like.Milton also runs roughshod over the words of Dwight Brumley, another eyewitness whom she failed to interview. She claims he saw the plane hit the water; he never stated that and he did not see it.Milton had an agenda, and judging from the reviews singing her praises for great journalism and attention to facts and details, she served her agenda well. The book, however, is pure taurine by-product."
4,...thoughts summary,"In his book The Role of Medicine, Thomas McKeown illustrates (using historical causes of death records from 1848 to 1970 for England and Whales) that the decline in mortality due to infectious disease usually preceded the invention of effective medical methods. The history of tuberculosis provides an especially good example to McKeown's thesis. ...McKewon even concludes (p120) ""If a choice must be made, free school meals are more important for the health of poor children than immunization programmes, and both are more effective than hospital beds."" !-I am not sure I agree: all McKeown showed is that an improvement in nutrition led to a decrease in infectious disease mortality, i.e. nutrition is important for health. He never compared two populations - one that received improved nutrition and no vaccination, for example, and the other that received vaccination and medicine with no improvement in hygiene and nutrition..."
2,Bland,"Really it's just sweet. Add too little and there's no flavor at all, add more and it gets way too sweet, it's like adding pure sugar with a very mild coffee flavor and no detectable white chocolate flavor. It's not horrible, just not very good either.The Ghirardelli double-chocolate flavor is better (if you like chocolate of course), but even that is nothing special, they really seem to just be cashing in on the good reputation of other Ghirardelli products with these - honestly any brand, even the ""Great Value"" Wal-Mart store brand is just about as good and at a much lower price."
3,Too sweet for me!,"I normally like sweet coffee drinks, but this was waaaaaay too sweet for me. Far sweeter than what you'd get in a white chocolate mocha from Caribou or Starbucks. It was like drinking concentrated sugar!Eventually gave it away to a family member with a stronger sweet tooth than mine."
1,Terrible Taste,"It tasted like bitter coffee with bad flavoring. It didn't taste anything like hot chocolate. It wasn't even white but a light tan color. I didn't like it but I passed it on to a coworker who says it's ""ok"". This is why I stick to land o'lakes. Buy at your own risk."
5,Anyone know if you can use this for baking?,"Anyone ever tried to use this for baking, like Hershey's Cocoa? I would like to try it but wondered if anyone else had already done so."
3,Pluto should be in there,"Pluto IS still a planet, and it should be discussed in this book. The debate over whether dwarf planets is NOT over. Only four percent of the IAU voted on the controversial demotion, and most are not planetary scientists. Their decision was immediately opposed by hundreds of professional astronomers led by Dr. Alan Stern, Principal Investigator of NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto. Stern is the astronomer who first coined the term ""dwarf planet,"" but he meant it to indicate a third class of planets, objects large enough to be rounded by their own gravity but not large enough to gravitationally dominate their orbits. He never intended for dwarf planets to not be considered planets at all. Any book that adopts one position, in this case the dynamics position, as the only one and does not inform readers that there is an entire different perspective, the geophysical definition, is not providing a complete picture of our solar system."
5,Bought this book approx. 25 years ago!,..and now is time to get a revised version.I grew up using this excellent reference and study guide. It is technically accurate and can be taken to the field. The color drawings are usefull.I can't wait to see that was revised.. 25 years later.
5,Great Movie,"I went to see this movie when it came out during a film festival here in Arizona. It was very well done. At the time of the showing it was in black and white, I would love to see it again in color. This movie kept my attention and left me wanting to see more. I would say this would be a great addition to your movie collection.Enjoy."
4,Okay,This one is not quite my cup of tea but it is a good mystery. I am just not fond of mob movies. It will keep you guessing especially if you miss some very important clues. It will keep you guessing as to who done it. There is a lot of language and violence so if you're squeamish you may want to pass this one up. All in all it's a good mystery.
1,Just More Low Budget Garbage,"the producers must have paid off people to write positive reviews of this sloppy amateurish film. looks like it was shot with an iphone in a trashy strip mall and edited with windows movie maker. the acting is atrocious and the dialogue horrendous to say the least. the dirty trick's tight little body is the only thing worth looking at. film would have been worth it if the director knew how to shoot a sex scene and if the dirty trick actually took her clothes off. instead he bores you with amateur cheese. the cop wears a uniform that looks like it was purchased at a Spencer's gift shop. the best part is when the dirty little trick gets blown away with a shotgun to the back at the end. don't worry, it's impossible to spoil a film that's already sour to begin with. a total waste of 80 minutes of my life. honestly, I feel like I should be paid $20 for being subjected to this load of crap."
2,Stuck in a time warp...,"This CD is reminiscent of the John Mayall recordings from the 60's and 70's...in fact it sounds like the same recordings remixed. The best song on here is Big Legged Woman, and it is only OK with further listenings. The rest sounds like it is 40 years old, and not in a good way."
3,Great for beginners,"Here is another book from the great chess author, Bruce Pandolfini. This one focuses on short-term combinations and uses matches from recent tournament play, along with a ""Little Chessercizes"" for children and those who have just learned the game. These ""Little Chessercizes"" also help with the big ones, providing clues by linking a certain problem or position to its smaller components, allowing the less experienced players to put them together and solve the problem.Certainly, this is a great, unique, and challenging book. However, if you would like to excel at chess - the one book you need is ""My System,"" by Nimzovich. In summary, this book (Pandolfini's) is great for the recreational player, fun for beginners and children, but the more advanced player who is playing for more than recreational should probably skip this book and either read Nimzovich or focus on areas of his/her game (i.e. opening, middlegame, endgame)."
1,dance,this cd is very unique. I enjoyed it personally but yiou really need to appreciate this type of music to like it
1,Not what it looked like on the picture,"When I opened my package I was disappointed at all the broken feathers. I ended up cutting off all the feathers because all those broken feathers just looked so messy! Also this mask isn't white. It's pink. I bought it to go with my blue senior ball gown and the pink didn't match. I couldn't figure out a way to keep it on my face either because it was stuck to an ugly black headband and it just wasn't working for me. I ended up making my own mask that looked a hundred times better than this one. This mask was huge too. It covered too much of my face and it's fuzzy on the inside so it was driving my eyes crazy! I hated it! And I couldn't even return it because I already cut off the ugly feathers, trying to make it work :("
5,Beautiful,Even more beautiful in person! It does come with a headband which is a nice feature. The quality met our expectations!
5,Educator's Choice Middle & High School Math Excelerator,"Educator's Choice Middle & High School Math Excelerator (Math Odyssey) is a very well-designed math tutorial program.The software is easy to use and keyword searchable, it includes animations, simulations, and learning games that can help you to get a better feel for the concepts.Thank you for your effort and keep on going."
1,Netaya - Two-tone multigem bracelet,"I was disappointed with the bracelet - it was too light and not as depicted in the picture. I have returned it, they have received it, and I am awaiting credit to my American Express account. Thanks."
1,not much to say really,"I receive email saying they shipped my book to another person, and had to wait for that person to ship it back( if that makes sence). I waited few weeks and did not receive the book, they gave me the refund.I most likely will not order from them again."
3,"Nothing new, but still exciting!","The reason why I didn't rate this book higher than 3 stars, is the fact, that most Elvis fans already have seen the pictures that this book features. Still, this book is a very, very nice photo-book, which contains glossy photo's of Elvis devided into three parts: the '50's, '60's and '70's. Most pictures are included in the '60's part, which is remarkable, because most books include pictures of the '70's. The photo's are from a high quality and there is a describtion with each picture. I would like to recommend this book to every person who has just started to buy books about Elvis Presley. For the die-hard Elvis fan it isn't essential."
2,If only they had a more modern version...,"While this is a great idea- If you like easy crossword puzzles, who doesn't want a booklet of TV Guide crosswords to do? However, the bulk of these puzzles are from the first twenty years of TV guide, and have lots of questions based on the stars and shows of the time. Which means that young folks who don't know a whole lot about the Lawrence Welk show or Rawhide, are not going to be able to do these puzzles.If you're older and want to relive your childhood TV, this may be for you. But not if you are younger...I'd love to see a yearly crossword publication, or biannual, that could give puzzlers a more modern set to do. Both this book, and the sequel, are just too dated to be worth the cash."
