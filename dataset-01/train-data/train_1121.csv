5,Fun Italian Techno Music,We really enjoy the CD eventhough we do not understand any Italian. It just fun music to listen.
2,As forgettable as a night after too much vodka,"The woman on the cover appears to be passed out from too much vodka,or asleep,after listening to this album;hardly a diva who'd grace the cover of ""Maxim"" or ""FHM."" This album is boring,not sexy,and you'll fall asleep WHILE listening to this like the lingerie-clad lady.The groups Alexandroid,ULA,and Moscow Groove Insitute get two tracks each,as if the musical landscape in Moscow were that boring.There are a few highlights-ULA's almost-Kraftwerk trance song ""Just an engine"",the Russian love song ""Solovushka:Evening Remix"",and the Moscow Groove Institute's use of native Russian music in ""Kali:Higher Mix."" However,one might agree with the singer Dimitri Pronin,whose strange ""You killing me"" sounds like the listener's response to this music.There is cool,sexy Eastern European music out there.This compilation isn't bringing sexy back to the former Soviet Union,now Russia."
4,Strange grooves,"I bought this on a whim and was pleasantly surprised at the variety of tunes that were on here. Some real kooky stuff, like Peter and the Wolf mashed up with BlackSea Surf Music? Some of the women vocalising on the tracks are singularly haunting, while others have the directness of a Muscovite love goddess at the ice cream stand in Progress Park. I think this is pretty remarkable and I find myself cranking some of it in my Trabant as I cruise at a smooth 45 km/h down the ekspressvei."
2,The worst of 10 dark chocolate covered coffee beans,"Concerned by the relatively high price, but loving dark chocolate covered coffee beans, I ordered 1 pound. Not only was the product high in price, but the shipping was top dollar. Many of the chocolate drops did not contain coffee beans and the taste was strictly mediocre compared tp pther available products. The package is cheap, not resealable and difficult to seal at all. Finally, the company is not very responsive and took 11 to 12 days to ship the product after they had the order. The deficiencies are in this product and not with Amazon!!!!!"
5,Very Good,"These chocolate covered beans are so good, very nice for a quick pick me up on the job, or walking the dog!"
4,Keoki Explodes again,"If you want to listen to something that will grab your mind and take you on a roller coaster, this is for you. Only a few weak songs. The rest is Keoki tearing up the beats like always. Great to blow up to."
4,Keoki explodes again,This album is Keoki at his best. Weird beats that build into a frenzy. Turn it on and let yourself blow up.
4,Most consistently good Electronica album I've bought yet,"I highly recommend this CD. The songs mix really well together and not one of them is boring. The problem with a number of techno/electronica/ drums'n'bass CDs is that at least half the tracks are bad. That's not the case with this one. Keoki is a genius, and that's not just because I'm from Hawaii."
2,Reese was miscasted,"It was entertainment for 3 dollars but I'm glad I didn't buy the movie. Reese was miscasted and never seemed to fit in. As a matter of fact the movie wasn't memorable, might be OK for Rupert but not for the talents of Colin Firth."
3,"A parody, not a tribute","This movie version wanders far from the text and the spirit of Oscar Wilde's play. Probably I'm a purist, but the version filmed in 1956 featuring Michael Redgrave and Margaret Rutherford was lots more fun."
5,Classic,A must have for anyone who likes love stories. A true classic and should be in everyones collection.
4,Charming production - marred by Charlie Mole's score,"One of Wilder's most beloved plays. Exceptional cast. Rupert Everett is perfect,Reese Witherspoon charming. Some humorous direction, original, but utterly inkeeping with Wilde's play. I think Oscar Wilde would have been pleased.There is one HIGHLY ANNOYING glaring, cringing fault. Charlie Mole's score.This film is classic turn of the Century British dialogue, plot and humor.The music is 20th century American jazz that wasn't even composed in thetimeframe of the play. Rupert even ""plays"" (probably not actually him)an antique pianoforte. And throughout the film I cringe when classic 1920'sAmerican Harlem Jazz intrudes RUDELY to disrupt Wilde's brilliant PROPER BRITISH 19th century dialogue. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.If you can ignore that (lucky you) you have a marvelous interpretation withlovely touches and a superb cast."
4,Quirky period piece,An all-star cast perform in this quirky period piece about undercover lovers. Two men lead double lives by using alias's. Two women fall in love only to find out their beloved's have lied about their real name. Things work out in the end and the men find out a wonderful secret that secures everyone's happiness.
4,"Great Modern Adaptation, But Check out the 1952 Production as Well","I love Oscar Wilde, and this is one of my favorite works. His typical satire of high society, love, morality, and marriage are by no means lost in this work.This film (unlike most adaptations) does a great job at staying true to its print version. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I liked the 1952 verson more. Maybe it's because that's the version I grew up with, but whatever the case maybe, do yourself a favor and check that one out as well. It's just as funny and just as charming if not more.The Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion Collection"
1,'Adaptation' is right,"I have to say I had high expectations for this movie, & was sorely disappointed by the entire thing. In fact, I was very tempted at several points during the movie to walk out. Where to begin? Witherspoon is too old for the character. More important, anyone who thinks their dialogue is better than Wilde's should simply have written their own entire script. Some of the best lines of this play were cut completely, in most scenes, the timing was wrong. Trying to expand the backdrops for scenes was also, imo, a huge mistake (ie, instead of sticking to the interiors of the play, the boys go to a 'gentleman's club' & Gwendolyn goes to a tattoo parlour, for heaven's sake!)Bad. The whole thing was bad, the timing was *much* too slow, etc., etc.,etc. Even Dame Judi couldn't save this bloater, & I love her work.Ok, so I'm used to this play *as a play*, onstage, not messing around with any additional cutsey dialogue. But lord, it wasn't good."
1,Utterly Abysmal & Disgraceful,"I love this play and have seen numerous productions of it over the years including the 100th anniversary performance at the Old Vic in London in 1995 (a splendid Lady Bracknell performed by Barbara Leigh-Hunt from Pride and Predjudice). I have also read the play a few times as well savoring Wilde's wit as I would a fine cabernet. This Oliver Parker adaptation on the otherhand is pure swill.As with his recent adaptation of Othello, Parker's vision and pacing for Earnest are all wrong. Gone are the elements of quick wit, Victorian manners and high-farce, replaced by a trashy and unpleasant opium-induced rag-time catastrophe.Never has Reese Witherspoon been less charming, Dame Judy less regal or Colin Firth less properly mannered.Truly, a farce of a farce."
2,Misconceived,"Oddly unsatisfactory, despite spot-on casting in some roles. Firth, Everett and Dench are particularly good; but director Oliver Parker seems to have no faith in the brilliant wordplay that makes this unsubstantial comedy one of the greatest ever written. The bizarrely anachronistic touches, such as sexual aggression and tattooing, do not serve and in fact hurt the movie; Cecily's fantasy sequences are strange and disruptive; Reese Witherspoon and Frances O'Connor are respectable but not spectacular. Buy the original with the unforgettable Dame Edith Evans."
4,GOOD except some...,"Brilliant, lovely, impeccable casting by the entire Oliver Parker's production team. Almost perfect performances by GORGEOUS actors and actresses upon beautiful costumes design, greenest of the countryside, and exquisite interior decorations. This Oscar Wilde adaption will no doubt remain timeless for the next three decades at least before another remake emerges in Hollywood.Everything's so agreeable except Reese Witherspoon's cast here... Parker must have been mistaken for Christ sake! Witherspoon is so NOT right for the choice. Her indifferent beauty and bubbly profile are totally incompatible with the rest of the casts - who has got the lordly Englishness. She plays the ""ward"" of Jack Worthing (Colin Firth) who's kept and schooled in his country house, no wonder."
5,Hilarious Fun,"This video arrived in mint condition and far sooner than I had expected.As far as the story goes - it is simply very funny and very well acted. Colin Firth and the rest of the cast are the best!There are nuances that one would miss on the first viewing of this film. On a second and third viewing, I am still finding more things to laugh at. For instance, after Jack and Algy have sung their song, Jack accidentally plucks one note on the guitar, and Algy promptly elbows him.It is a farce, among farces - don't miss seeing it."
5,funny movie,"This is a charming and funny movie, with Rupert Everett and Colin Firth doing a great job. If you want an amusing, lighthearted movie to watch, this one is for you! It begins with an intersting scene with Rupert Everett and continues on being lighthearted. Highly suggested, 5 stars!"
5,clean and enjoyable,"The story line was cute and easy to follow. Has a lot to offer without embarrassing scenes and language. Intelligent tale with romance and good feeling drama even sensible comedy and action. This was fun viewing and ""hey""! Colin Firth!!!! I recommend this movie to just anybody, even religious type folks."
2,Silly,"It has such a great cast, but it was just silly, improbable. None of the characters were believable, even considering the relaxed standards one expects from a comedy. Oh, and it wasn't funny."
3,"Brand new, good quality","The only issue I have with this movie is that in future, I would only pay around $5 for it. Apart from that, no complaints."
4,Enjoyable,"Very entertaining, the cast works well together, Colin Firth is marvelous. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was excellent."
1,Disappointed,I love the movie. However I was very disappointed that I bought a brand new copy that just stopped working close to the end of the movie. I found I had a few hiccups trying to find out how to exchange it instead of a return since I really wanted the movie. When email for assistance I found it not be be clear and to the point but really only referred me to the same stuff I had found. It wasn't until after I was past the timeframe that I found the exchange option. My second email with questions wasn't even answered. No response at all. I'm disappointed in the product quality and Amazon's response
1,the importance of being earnest,the dvd that I purchased did not work on my dvd player...I asked for refund or another copy...have heard nothing
1,As entertaining as a piece of toast...,"I actually found this movie quite tiresome... like watching paint dry or something. The characters were quite annoying, with the logic of five year old children. I sat through the entire movie, hoping against odds that it would improve... however, it did not... in fact, it may have gotten worse. I would not recommend it... the humor was dry, and the pace was slower than a turtle's."
4,"Wonderful, Witty, Widescreen, Wilde","Pros- Oliver Parker has done a great job streamlining the dialogue of the play while keeping Wilde's sophisticated wit intact.- Rupert Everett and Colin Firth have a great chemistry, especially evident for example when they sing the ditty ""Lady Come Down"" (Oscar Wilde poem set to music by Charlie Mole)- Judy Dench as Lady Bracknell- A great, fun, family movie suitable for all agesCons- Serious Oscar Wilde purists no doubt will find countless pedantic put-downs to criticize this adaptation, but then again seriousness is the only refuge of the shallow."
3,Don't Mess with Perfection,"I should have read other reviews first and I wouldn't have purchased this movie version of Oscar Wilde's wonderful play. Some of my favorite lines are cut and I was horrified that the ending was altered. In addition to removing some of Wilde's lines, the screenwriter added bits he thought were funnier. They aren't."
3,Enjoyable Movie,I pushed myself to watch this movie. It was not my typical fare. I did not stop it. I watched all of it.
3,movies,not as good as the 1952 version.....why are more words needed for the review when I've already said all I have to say?
2,Great cast - just no magic,"If you like period films, over the top dramatic style, subtle almost too subtle humor and don't know Oscar Wilde, you may like this for $1.99. There's nothing I can point to that makes it bad (see ""Most Helpful Reviewer"" on this, he seems to know his stuff); I just kept thinking ""I'm just not that into you"" while watching it."
2,Dreadful!,What a complete misreading of the play! The only good thing in this film is Miss Prism. Gwendolen getting a tattoo????!!! Driving herself???!!! Lady Bracknel with a shady past???!!! Jazz music????!!!Please...someone tell the screenwriters and directors to leave the comedy to Oscar!Stick with the old version
3,What's with the skipping???,"The movie was good. It was a fair representation of the play.However, the DVD was supposed to be new but when I played it, it was skipping and upon further examination, was dirty and scratched. It was new or was supposed to be. The DVD came in the wrapping but it was poor quality.4 stars on the movie2 stars on the quality of disc.I am very disappointed with this allegedly new disc being so poor of quality. I missed out on the last 20 or so minutes of the movie because it would play for 2 seconds then freeze."
5,Fantastic,"This DVD is a must. If you like period drama then this is for you. I agree with other reviews that the tattoo on the bottom was a wast of time but it was so short that it did not matter that much.I am a great Colin Firth fan, so I guess he can do no wrong. Judie Dench plays her part so well although I still see her as ""M"" for some strange reason.I have rated this movie a 5/5 because it will bring hours of entertainment, yes do watch it more than once.Jim"
4,Lots of fun,"Well, it's Oscar Wilde, so of course it's fun. But the best part is the duet sung between Rupert and Firth. They do it a little bit in the film, but there's an extended version during the credits. Great interplay between the actors and fun to watch."
5,A Must View,"I thought this movie was highly entertaining. I am not a particularly big fan of Rupert Everett but he is absolutely charmingly mischievious in this movie. Colin Firth is wonderful as Ernest/Jack Worthing. Both of these actors play parts where they excel. The scenes where Everett and Firth banter back and forth are the funniest. Then, there is Dame Judi Dench who is so perfect as Algy's aunt. The location where this movie was filmed is wonderful. In addition, the special features of the dvd has interviews with all the actors. The dvd is worth owning."
3,The Importance of Being Earnest,"This movie is entertaining, but has some unnecessary crude elements that were not in the original play. I showed it to my high school class, but had to edit a few parts. Acting is very good."
1,"Fairly good movie, BAD DVDs!","The first hour of the movie is fairly good, fun to watch, but not entirely true to the original work. The DVD on the other hand is awful. The first one sent to me played an hour into the movie and then froze. The replacement was no better. Tried these DVDs on three different players and they will not play correctly!"
5,Let Us Remember,"What can I say? I have viewed this film hundreds of times. And each time the ending brings a rush of pride to my soul and a tear to my heart. This accurate tale of Sophie Scholl and her cohorts is a celebration of the human spirit. It is a 1940's ""Testament of Youth."" The director and writer should be proud. For those who know little of German resistance, this is the place to start. I have been to their graves. They are interred in Alte Perlach Cemetary in Munich, Germany. Not Perlach Cemetary. Go to Alte Perlach."
3,healthy food but not as tasty as advertised,I'm glad I purchased this book as the recipes are healthy but a competent cook will be wise to jazz them up. I've made a few things so far but can't say I'm thrilled with any of the outcomes. I was really annoyed when the caption said something about it being worth the extra work and it came out so bland even with my attempts to add flavor! I'm a little gunshy now to try more recipes from the book as the ingredients are expensive and I don't want to choke down another family serving over a weeks time as my husband so far has not been impressed! Bottom line: healthy but bland.
3,Nothing new for vegetarians,"Though the recipes in this book are good, they're nothing new if you're familiar with vegetarian cooking. It was mostly everyday foods with meat substitutes (ie. ""chicken"" salad, breakfast for dinner, smoothies, etc.) We haven't specifically made any of the recipes as they are things we're used to eating already, but if you're new to preparing meatless dishes for kids, it would be an ok choice. I think it would make a great gift for people wanting to host vegetarian kids for the first time (we're sending ours to their grandparents so they have ideas for when the kids visit) or families looking to incorporate a few meatless dishes into their weekly meals."
5,"Yummy, Simple & Creative",My 2-year-old was getting bored with her food. This book has helped spice up her meals & has provided healthy & easy meals for the whole family. The stuffed green peppers (we used red because that is what we had) are amazing. My husband loves the Peanut Butter Kisses & my 2-year-old loves to lick the spoon! You do not need to have kids to enjoy the recipes in this book.
3,"OK, but Not Really Kid Friendly (unless your kid grew up vegetarian)","Typical vegetarian fare. I was looking for easy, simple recipes for my 5-year-old, who refuses to eat meat, yet prefers chips and ice cream to healthy foods. The recipes in this book include bean sprouts and other not-so-kid-friendly ingredients. They just don't impress my son. I much prefer ""Feeding the Healthy Vegetarian Family"" by Ken Haedrich."
4,Good primer for vegetarian meal planning,Pros:Love the huge number of recipes.Cons: Focus to heavily on wheat-based products such as: breads and bagelsWish:Had more recipes involving more fruits and vegetables
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed with this book overall. I have a fussy eating 4yr old and this book is simply not designed for fussy eaters who don't like identifiable vegetables. This book is more suitable for older kids who may be more prepared to at least taste different foods.
2,Mighty Flimsy,"While it does look nice enough, the Metal is so thin that the Garbage Disposal Shakes it violently at times when it's in use. It flexes a great deal when the Large Kitchen faucet is moved, and vibrates quite a bit. I am going to have to pull it, and try to reinforce the whole body, and then reinstall it once again. If I had known now, what I didn't know then, I would have paid for a much higher quality Sink. Never buy a Pig in a Poke, your going to get poked every time."
2,Blood Myths,"This was a dumb movie! Don't bother buying it! No plot, poor acting and I could not figure out what was going on except for some crazy maniac killing for fun."
2,Still waiting,"Item very slow to ship, still isn't here yet.Somebody is going to be disappointed with a late Christmas gift."
3,"Who Good, Marsh Bad.","Not a bad book, but Dave Marsh's style of writing/preaching/knowing-it-all really got on my nerves (minus 2 stars because he wrote it, and not someone else). There's way too much about the making of ""Tommy"", and not enough about the older albums. Some great stuff in here about Shel Talmy, Kit Lambert, Radio Caroline, New Action/Track Records, and a good section about Mod culture (essential reading for those outside the UK... Mod was more than just wearing a bulls-eye T-shirt). The book ends after Keith Moon dies, and the first ""final tour"", so if you were looking for more recent Who history, it's not in here. Still, it's a decent read if you can stomach Dave Marsh."
2,Ideal for the Who-Hater,"From my own and friends' reactions, it seems that the more you like The Who, the less you will like this book. Like Leonard Malton on films and James Michener on any subject, Marsh makes exciting things insufferable. The wheezing digressions, no-nothing judgments and constant air of self-importance smother fandom's lively flame.Lester Bangs could communicate to you the flavor, rhythm, and personal significance of a song or ouvre. Marsh has no such ear, and overwhelms this project with his own wooly-brained inanity. Even descriptions of the band member's intimate, often emotional life experiences are uninvolving. Tell you what--buy the albums and just guess what kind of lives these guys had and what their motives were. That'll be a lot more fun than this quagmire."
2,"This book is crap, essentially, with a few gold nuggets.",Dave Marsh is the most long-winded fool ever to usea typewriter. Most of this book comes to you directlyfrom his anus. It is nevertheless a good referenceif you can dig through the piles and piles of rubbish.
3,It's a good book for the early history of the Who.,"While I can't say anything personal about David Marsh, this is a great book for the first half, until it hits on the mid-1970's. Then Marsh focuses less and less on the music. Tommy is covered a bit too much, but it is what the Who will be remembered for. The only problem I really had with the book was Marsh's total dislike of Face Dances and It's Hard. While these aren't the best Who albums, they are far from the embarrassment Marsh makes them out to be. Overall, a good introduction to the Who."
4,"Good summary for its time, but it omits many human stories.","Marsh draws an intriguing picture of The Who and it's writer, Pete Townshend. The book could use more photos and descriptions of contextual material. Perhaps it simply needs an update to reflect today's reading audience."
3,A detailed history of the Who's career.,"Marsh's writing can be extremely annoying, but if you can get past that, it's not a bad book. A very good detailed story (especially the band's early career) of their rise to the top. Marsh can be extremely self-rightous, and that gets in the way sometimes, but if you want to learn about the band, this is the book."
4,"nice try, lazy ending","I think the first 3/4 of this are terrific. Too much 'tommy', not enogh 'quad'--but what's new? Good backround stuff.However, he covers the death of Keith Moon, Empty Glass, Face Dances, Chinese Eyes, and It's Hard in 3 pages. Utterly ridiculous. I think he got bored, or ate his advance.Great Pete stories. I refer you all to 'Horse's Neck', pete's autobiography with a great version of the guitar teacher story that Marsh gets wrong."
5,Still The Definitive Who Biography,"There are others that would lay claim to it, but this is the definitive Who bio for me. With great interviews from insiders, and a wealth of quotes from the band members themselves, this account takes you there. Only two complaints: Much too much time is spent on the 60's and not as much attention is paid to 70's when The Who was still extremely relevant. It takes up to page 350 to get to The Who at Woodstock, leaving a mere 170 pages to cover Who's Next, Quadrophenia, two feature films, Keith Moon's death, and the Cincinnati tragedy. Also, a revision would have been nice, taking into account the last 25 years (Live Aid, Entwistle's death, Townsend's legal problems, reunions, etc) Perhaps it's time for a sequel? Call it ""Some Got Old."""
2,"Good subject, terrible writer","As a Who fan, I gobbled up all the details I could about the band, but soured on this book because Dave Marsh is a mediocre writer and an utterly incompetent critic."
2,Marsh kills the spirit of rock and roll,"I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that Dave Marsh's preachiness and know-it-all attitude really is a detriment to this book. Before I Get Old is well researched and thorough, the only problem is that it takes all the life out of what is one of the most exciting and dangerous rock groups of all time. Marsh really fails to capture the early days of the Who, because he seems to judge everything as the elitist American reviewer he is. In other words, he has no sense of humour and doesn't capture the essence of what made the Who what they were. Pete Townshend is quoted at length, and he can be a real bore, he does his best communicating with a guitar in his hand and writing great songs of angst, rebellion and rage. Marsh has done some good work here and there, but he is totally out in left field with this one, he really captured nothing of The Who."
4,man oh man...............,"this is a great period novel...... au contraire to what other folk have said, this is a great novel with some steamy scenes and top o' the art writing. couldn't put it down even if i wanted to! lots of awesome scenes, great writing, just awesome! cannot wait to pick up another book from ms. strand. she is a rare talent. man oh man........."
1,Paid toooooo much for shipping,"Received this product in good condition. Item includes the cover which is nice but there are no shorting blocks for the terminals, which are typically included with this type of wiring block. My main gripe is that I paid way too much for shipping this item. The item is very light in weight and the Price Pros could have shipped this item via First Class or Priority Mail. Project has to be postpone because I have to search for these damn shorting blocks. Product full description was incomplete. I give this service from Price Pros only one star. I would never ever order any products from this company again. Make sure you that check out the shipping costs before completing your order. Do not order from these guys!!!!!!!!"
1,Old tech,"Got it in a refurb PC, it runs hot, loud, and died withint 6 months. Definitely outdated. Get a WD Black or RE4!"
2,Broken,I received this in the mail and the teddy bear which is supposed to be in the corner of the frame was broken off. Not very good to see the week before Christmas when it was supposed to be a Christmas present.
1,Nothing Here,"This CD has little to offer a jazz guitar fan. Very amateur sounding guitar playing, and not at all the desirable tone expected from a jazz guitar. True, the rhythm section is good but the sound quality doesn't even do them justice. I think someone stood in front of the band holding a mic. Listen to the sound samples offered. If you like it, what can I say? But unless you own everything Joe Pass, Wes, Howard Alden, Bruce Foreman, Barney Kessell and SO many other I can't list and you are just dying to buy another jazz guitar CD, don't waste you money on this one."
1,"thin book, large type, not much info and expensive","Aimed at ""Website Developers"" the book wastes a lot of time and space on more obvious things. For example it tells you which PHP file to edit to change a string and where to in the file the string is. That's nicely done. But then it does the same thing over and over again file after file. A simple table after the first example would have done the trick. The real problem with that is the examples are in a very large font, lots of whitespace. Yet the book is small and very thin.Basically not much content and way too expensive. This book would be worth $10 if you were not a website developer but wanted to be one someday."
5,A great book for osCommerce newbies!,"I am a web designer trying to get into osCommerce, and have really struggled with this program. I worked through a store on my own but it took a very long time to get everything working, and I had to pay a PHP programmer to do the ""heavy lifting."" I was really happy to find this book because it answered so many questions for me. The book is aimed at non-programmers like myself, who have strong HTML knowledge but not PHP knowledge. osCommerce is a really powerful program, and it is easy to make a major mistake that brings the whole thing crashing down. This book was really helpful in easing the process for my second store, and allowing me to do more of the customizing on my own."
5,simply superb,"well the book covers the wide spectrum of the power systems field especially laying more emphasis on the stability aspects. this is highly recommended for graduate students pursuing research in excitation system analysis when dealing with the stability of the systems,also the covering a major portion of power system stabilizers."
5,This book expains things very well,"Unlike many technical and programming books, the author of this book shows his love and dedication to programming, and sets down the ground rules with a little bit of history to help understand exactly what it is that you are doing. This book is so full of good information, you almost have to read it one paragraph at a time, yet it is so intriguing that it's hard to put down."
5,A valentine to the soul,"I came across this book at a local bookstore, wanted to recommend it to a friend in England, and so checked to see if it were listed with Amazon. The book's message is very simple and straight-forward, common sensible, but not at all simplistic or precious. I enjoyed the stories about the author's grandmother, who had one of those interesting ""small"" lives, and found her advice very compelling. Plus the author has a real gift for language and phrasing; her descriptions are very evocative. It's a book I'd highly recommend."
4,Don't sell this book back!,"An outstanding lab text for sophomore level 1-yr organic courses. Any chemistry/physical science major should not sell this book back at the end of the semester! Half of the book is dedicated to experiments which while informative is not the real gem here. The other half of the book covers techniques in organic and microscale chemistry. If you ever need to build a chromatographic column or do vacuum filtration again, you will be glad that you kept this book in your library.The techniques section alone justifies buying this book. Chemistry majors, microbiologists, environmental scientists and engineers will all find this text valuable in their future careers."
5,WWU grad,"Dr. Pavia's class was so much fun. It was great to have a book written for our facility, by our instructors. I recommend this book to other schools because the techniques are clearly explained and the experiments are interesting."
2,Inferior to the german brand,"I was pleased to find these in-channel vents at about 30% less than the well known German brand (which I have on another car). However, when I got them it was immediately obvious that these are vastly inferior. Aside from the fact that they were scuffed and very dusty, which was probably due to careless handling, they are made of a flimsy material that seems like it wouldn't last very long. Also, even though it's supposedly and in-channel application, these had strips of double -stick tape on the piece that goes INTO the door channel - and that's a recipe for disaster. Spend the extra bucks for the other brand."
2,3 Interviews,"This is a pretty boring docco on Alien Abductions. I took the chance on it, and am not terribly impressed.It's just 3 interviews with 3 alien abductees. And nothing else. No video footage or UFO fighting reports. The graphics are virtually non-existent. There's a little bit of 3D graphics that looks like a 13 year old did it, it's that basic.On the upside however, the interviews with the 3 abductees are pretty detailed and sound genuine. However, this alone doesn't make a good product that will sell. Fact is... and I know you've seen this too... When you watch a docco, you want to WATCH it, and not ""watch someone tell it"". They need to take a lesson from the makers of the ""OZ Encounters"" UFO docco and put in some cool graphics."
4,Love it!,"I don't have a computer at home so I thought that this printer would be a great idea. I was right! I love this printer. I couldn't ask for a better product. It is easy to use and has wonderful options. Just a word of advice, don't print too many pictures at one time. The printer seems to overheat and freeze in whatever mode it was in. I have never lost any pictures due to this small glitch. I am so pleased with this product, I should have done this months ago!"
2,Works great... Sort of,"Well this product we purchased in Dec. of 2005. It worked great, photo quality prints every time... Then about a month ago two small plastic clips that hold in a metal wire that is crucial to the print cartridge functioning broke off.That little wire can do its job if it is pressed back into place but will fall out of place when replacing cartridges and perhaps during use. We have not throughly tested it yet.Bottom line, a great little printer that could... Before it's gentle little parts broke."
1,Same 880B7418 Problem,"The printer worked fine, until I tried to bluetooth sync it to my iPhone, which failed. After that all it would do is show the power icon with the code 880B7418. The only way it would print is if I pulled the power plug and reconnected it...then it would print one job and the error would appear again.Buyer beware."
1,Less then 2 years moderate usage and now it's only printing in black backup mode!,"This HP Photosmart 8150 Printer worked fine with only moderate use for about 1.75 years but now the flimsy Tri-color Ink Cartridge holder no longer properly detects any new Tri-color Ink cartridges detecting every new Tri-color cartridge as being bad.Less than 2 years of moderate use at best and it only prints in black back up mode now which makes this once great photo printer absolutely useless.*Word to the wise, if you buy this over priced, older, discontinued model HP Photosmart 8150 Printer new, you had better get the 2 or 3 year replacement, next day exchange extended warranty with it! It will malfunction before it's two years old almost guaranteed!"
3,You get what you pay for,"Not a terribly bad printer, with fairly good photo quality. However, the paper does jam frequently with both plain and photo papers. Sometimes the printer does not recognize the photo tray when placed into position."
2,Locks up Computer!,"Yes the prints are great and you don't have to use a computer,but when we first installed it the computer would lock at the post. Seems if your not using the newest bios Windows XP sees the printer as a hard drive and tries to boot from it which of course it can't.HPs work around is to unplug the printer everytime you boot the computer. Not a viable option. Updating the bios is not something for the faint hearted. We hooked it up to our newer computer and everything went fine, but thats not where we wanted it. So it hard to reccomend this printer with the support so weak."
2,Flimsy as advertised...,"As others have specified, things are flimsy. I've had this printer now for 389 days. And as the tech support person I talked to this evening, there is only a 365 day warranty...As others have said, it was the color cartridge that is no longer being recognized.I love(d) this printer... Decent software. Extremely happy with the prints. But after finding out that my ""photo"" printer is essentially now just a really fast (and that isn't really true with it in ink-backup mode) text printer, I'm not really thrilled with it anymore.Hopefully there's someone on eBay ready to buy the ink that I just dropped a gold mine on trying to debug this problem tonight..."
4,Love In Black and White,"Enemy Fields, the cleverly titled and wonderfully written novel by J.Marie Darden, takes readers on a thought-provoking journey through the forbidden interracial romance of Sister and Evian. Everything about this novel appealed to me. The unsophisticated vernacular of Sister, a poor black teenage girl hired to work for Evian's family spoke to me in her own voice. Through Darden's cleverly penned words, I felt Sister's every emotion. Enemy Field's is a bittersweet and believable book that thankfully avoids the clichés surrounding interracial love and instead, focuses on the mechanics of a romance that had the power to tear a town apart. Finally...a book that actually reads like a true story. This is definitely a keeper!"
5,PAGE TURNER!,I LOVED THIS BOOK! THE CHARACTERS ARE SO TRUE TO LIFE AND I COULDN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. IT'S SO REFRESHING TO ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS IN A BOOK. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!
2,In Which We Serve DVD,"As most folks are aware, this is a classic war movie, so I'm not making any comments about the film itself; however, the quality of the DVD (both picture and sound) are rather poor, hence my only two stars for this review. I'm surprised that this film isn't part of the Criterion Collection."
5,In Which We Serve,"With Britain in the pit of the Second War, playwright Coward was desperate to do a morale-boosting film, and ""Serve"" was the inspired result. The normally effete Coward is appropriately ""stiff upper lip"" as Kinross, and a young Mills stands out in a first rate ensemble cast which also includes Bernard Miles and Celia Johnson as Coward's wife. (Also look fast for a young Richard Attenborough!) With Coward at the helm as writer, star, and even score composer, David Lean handling most of the directing (and all the editing), and future director Ronald Neame the cinematography, the result is one of Britain's very finest war films, which accomplished everything Coward set out to do for his country."
2,"tedious ""in which we serve","Highly recommended,but,to many scenes of men bobbing aroundin a life boat. Little action scenes and those that were seenwere not believable."
5,great treatment of darcy's perspective,"I loved reading these books, and especially enjoyed this last one. I hope the author writes more adventures for the Darcy's as a married couple. I'd love see more of her ideas for the characters' development. I felt for Darcy and how he tried to redeem himself in Elizabeth's eyes and for his own good. I have already recommended this series to several friends who love Pride and Prejudice"
4,"Well done, a little dramatic","I enjoyed this series very much. It stuck to the Austen style and the essence of the characters. My only complaint is that it was a little over-dramatic with Darcy's inner pining, yearning, struggles about Elizabeth. It didn't seem terribly realistic.But I enjoyed it well enough to buy it, so I give it four stars."
4,almost entirely likeable,"This is really a very good book. Ms. Aidan writes well and comes very close to giving a real reason for Darcy's turnaround. Darcy's close friend is an interesting addition and hopefully she will write another book including more about the friend, Miss Darcy, their faith and its effects on Darcy. I really liked the way she implied spiritual change in Darcy. I was disappointed, however, at the end by the trite (and tired) speeches by Darcy's friends waxing on about love. Those parts were so out-of-character with the rest of the book. It is still worth a read, just ignore the old 'love solves all' humanistic sentiment at the end."
3,Format Errors in Kindle Edition,"First - I LOVE Pamela Aidan's P&P contributions. All three books are good to outstanding in all areas - setting, language, character, episodes. I was less enchanted with the Norwyke Castle episode; however, it served a purpose. Having said that I found the more than average conversion errors to be found in the Kindle edition of These Three Remain. I noticed several instances of lack of spacing between paragraphs reflecting changes of the setting, and justification irregularities throughout. Granted I admit to a perfectionist streak with editing processes, and the story is not truly affected; but it does break the flow. If I had not read these stories prior to my Kindle edition, it might have been more disturbing."
5,"These Three Remain: A Novel of Fitawilliam Darcy, Gentleman",I ENJOYED THE BOOK== IT FOLLOWED PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.. IT TOLD HOW DARCY THOUGHT ABOUT HIS ROMANCE WITH ELIZABETH.. COULD USE MORE AMOROUS BEHAVIOR.
4,A wonderful conclusion!,"This book does not disappoint! I very much enjoyed watching Darcy's inner transformation throughout this novel, and thought it captured beautifully his feelings, of which we never really learn or understand until the conclusion of Pride & Prejudice.Why 4 stars, then? The author could have dispensed with some of the political and moral drama in book 2 and the little that there was in this book, and she would still have found a successul way to draw out Darcy's character without so much strange and sometimes bizarre occurences (Lady Sylvanie's 'acquaintance' John Bellingham, who later assassinates the Prime Minister - Lady Sylvanie and all THAT drama should have been left in book 2, and not dragged along).Darcy is enough of a man on his own that he doesn't need to reduce himself and jeopardize his character as much as he seems to in order to have that true turn of heart and mind to embrace the justice of Elizabeth's reproofs to him at Hunsford.Overall, an excellent final book!"
4,So now you know.,"This volume concludes the well-written and enjoyable Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman series. While there is a shocking amount of Jane Austen related literature being published at the moment, Aiden's work is definitely a cut above the rest. Her writing style nicely mimics Ms. Austen's and in my capacity as an ardent P&P fan, I find her take on Darcy to be completely believable. So, if you're looking to venture into the vast and bizarre world of Janeites and their books, then by all means, start here. But you should probably start with the first volume of this series and not, you know, this one."
5,Fall in love with Mr Darcy all over again!,"I love the character development in Aidan's third book. Georgiana is a deeper character than in the original P&P. I hope to read more about her (and her admirer!) in future Aidan books! I also liked how Aidan describes what 'sacrifices' Darcy had to make to 'save' Elizabeth and her family. It made it more realistic and heroic. I loved the new characters she introduced too, they were entertaining and admirable. I want to hear more about them! I will definitely read this book again, (maybe while reading P&P at the same time)!"
5,Perfectly Done!,What a great ending to this trilogy! I could not set it down once I started. The whole third book is climactic and such a juicy reward. I think Pride and Prejudice fans would enjoy this trilogy as the perfect companion piece.
3,These three remain,This one of the trio was very slow moving and repetious. I didn't find it as interesting as the first two.
2,Difficult language,"This book seems written in the style of Jane Austin, not Georget Hayer.I have tried to get into it but find the prose too diffficult to proceed I intend to proceed some day but for now I must leave till I am in a better mood. Or my tastes have improved"
4,Darcy redeemed,"After anxiously awaiting receipt of These Three Remain I found the book very statifying - a delightful read. If I have any complaint it must be that the books ""read"" far too quickly -- I couldn't put them down and was disappointed when I closed the back cover.I agree with previous reviewers that Pamela Aidan's treatment of Darcy's emotional angst and redemption was a pleasure to read, but wonder how a man would have written that transformation(?) Aidan's treatment of Darcy's interactions with the catty Miss Bingley and overbearing LCD were also redeeming. And the wedding scene is far more satisfying than the P&P; original. But what will come of Georgiana, enigmatic Dy, the charismatic Col. Fitzwilliam? Can we dare to hope that Ms. Aidan will address those sub-plots in her next book?"
5,High Five!,"One of the best Modern Tango albums I've listened to in a long time. With the Direction of Rudolf Werthen bringing intense emotion and full scale rhythm to this album, you are sure to be pleased. A true legacy album to Rudolf's enduring career.Not recommended for a cheap and cheesy stereo system. Be certain that your stereo can play SACD/Hybrid CDs."
1,Tango but only 2 or 3 song the rest .............,I heard static in some song like they reocorded off an LP. I was under impression all track will be Tango but NOT. Very dissappointed.
1,TANGO (THE ELEGY FOR THOSE WHO ARE NO LONGER HERE),The pitfalls of ordering a SACD without due dilegence was demonstrated by my purchase of this SACD. I love tango music and Buenos Aires. This SACD is tango in the atonal mode. Some may like it but it is not classical tango. If Stravinsky were alive today this would be his tango music. Caveat Emptor! Listen to a portion of this SACD before you buy it.
2,didnt like it.,its thin aluminium or soft metal. hitting with a hammer with a diamond grated edge left marks on the metal. no instructions. poor product.
5,So Inspirational,I will purchase every one of Louie Giglio's dvd's as they come out. He has a passion (no pun intended) for Christ and for inspiring others. I saw this show live and was excited to own the dvd.
5,Incredible message!,Terrific DVD with an incredible message. No one quite shares the message of God's greatness like Louie Giglio. Amazing reminder of the awesomeness of our God!
5,Developing the Early Learner Bk. 1,"This is a great four book series for three to four year olds. It developsmotor, visual, auditory, and comprehension skills through fun worksheet pages that gradually increase in difficulty. Following a wavy line with a pencil, listening to instructions on how to color, remembering a short list of instructions and following them, learning opposites, learning sequencing, mazes, puzzles, etc. It's lots of fun and will have your child begging to do more even while they're learning!"
4,Good Introduction to the Area,"While this small paperback is becoming dated (published in 2001); it is one of the texts I use in my senior seminar in collective violence and terrorism. The book includes a good chapter on cults, militia, and hate groups. The chapter on terrorism introduces examples to describe vigilante, insurgent, transnational, and state terrorism. Students probably find this categorization to be the most helpful in examining terrorism. Recommended."
5,Getting the Creative Juices flowing,"This is one of those books that helps those who are only semi-creative get some ideas on how to make projects their own. Most of the patterns are not overly complex. Some of them are going to seem pretty challenging for folks who are not too far into their scroll-sawing avocation. The photography is worth the price of the book. Different treatments of the various projects, different textures, different color combos, all help the craft mechanic to become a possibility thinker. The book presumes some familiarity with scrolling. It's not a book for a rank beginner, but most of the patterns can be accomplished by a person who has learned to cut a two dimensional project with inside and outside cuts. For those reasons alone, it's a good one to have on your shelf. Highly recommended."
2,Cheeeesy!,"Two stars is generous! The ""strict tempos"" on these CD's sound like they were provided by a digital drum machine. Some of the tracks are completely synthesized, and they sound like it -- cheeeeesy! The tracks with the trumpet (or is it a flugelhorn?) and electric guitar are somewhat better. All but one of the tangos rate one star. Some of the waltzes and sambas rate two stars. The rumbas and mambos are uninspired. The cha chas don't."
5,Superb album,I purchase this album to compare between CD and Vinyl in term of sound quality.Now i will enjoy more listening via vinyl there pro and cons between this 2 version..anyway im enjoying this album..SUPERB!!!
4,A Worthwile Album,"Before I begin my review of Alicia's Unplugged album, let me state that in listening to music, I do not look for perfection, but rather, emotion. It is safe to say that Alicia's vocals are not of the utmost perfection on this album. It is obvious that her voice is a bit strained and she does fall flat on a couple of incidences. However, Alicia never fails to deliver raw emotion, which is always absolutely beautiful. Her versions of ""Diary"" and ""Fallin"" deliver the most emotion in my opinion and are the true gems on the album. On ""Fallin"" Alicia sounds as if she is simply pouring her heart out. I even welcome her hoarsness, especially evident on this track. This album can be played from start to finish without skipping a single track, and is worth buying if only for the new versions of ""Diary"" and Fallin."""
1,thumbs down,"I am so, SO disappointed in this album. When I think of Unplugged I think of raw, in-depth performances. Alicia is great on this album but I did NOT buy it to hear her back-up singers sing over her and most of the songs. This album was a waste of my money. Wild Horses was one of the worst covers (thanks to Adam Levine) that I've ever heard. I re-sold it the day after I bought it."
3,Unplugged by Alicia Keys,"I was waiting for this album. She is hands down the best live performer on the planet today. This album however does nothing to reflect that. The new arrangement of ""Fallin"" does not work. ""Unbreakable"" is one of the most god-awful songs of this year. A few of the songs are also not in full-length, such as ""You Don't Know my Name"", ""How Come You Don't Call Me"" & ""Diary"". They are missing verses, bridges and what not. ""Wild Horses"" & ""Every Little Bit Hurts"" are nice. I would not recommend this album though, just seems to much is missing."
2,"New title for this should be: ""Arrangements Gone Wrong""","I absolutely adore Alicia Keys and her phenominal talent. I enjoy listening to her rich vocals and emotional buy in to every song she sings. BUT, the arrangements of these songs are so WRONG on this recording, it was a humongous distraction that I could not get past. It felt like I was hearing some of the songs for the first time; not something I was liking. Nearly every song was dipped in a jazz tone, which certainly did not accentuate her R&B; style. The background vocals were too funky at times and the supporting band was anything but smooth.One plus for this album was it was Alicia Keys after all. I'm glad to hear her perform, but just not these arrangements. This CD will either gather dust on my shelf or be eBayed, sad to say.Bottom line: Even die hard Alicia Keys fans may have trouble digesting this, soley on the crummy arrangements it brings."
1,Copy-protection DESTROYS the listening experience,"I was so shocked when I saw that ugly ""content protected"" logo on this CD. Copy protection means that this CD is incompatible with the iPod, the largest-selling MP3 player in the world. Why Sony/BMG would knowingly make a CD that can't be used on iTunes is a mystery. Copy-protection lessens the customer experience and alienates honest consumers who use iPods. Of course, you could burn a copy of this CD and rip it back to iTunes, but who has the patience for that? I have the right to rip my CDs directly into iTunes without any hassle whatsoever. But thanks to the geniuses at Sony, that isn't a possibility."
1,we've heard enough,"come on people, she's not that great...give other new women a chance and let her go...she's no Stevie Wonder so stop pretending"
3,"Great music, but...","The music is great. The copy protection is not. J-Records is a subsidiary of Sony BMG. If you trust that the copy protection program on this CD is safe, then by all means buy the CD. You might want to do a web search for ""Sony BMG rootkit"" first though."
1,Copy protection is dangerous,I never buy copy protected CDs because the tecnhiques that the record labels use to implement the copy protection breaks my computer.
1,Only if you like living dangerously,Here is another CD spoiled by copy protection that will play unknown havoc with your computer if you dare to insert it in a CD drive. Avoid until it gets rereleased as a real CD. I used to be a Keys fan but I'm having second thoughts.
1,Freakin' copy protection,What a pain! I tried to put all the tracks in itunes and the first 7 tracks were fine but then the rest playback horribly. I had no idea that the copy protection would do this to a cd I BOUGHT. Now my only choice is to download this in a non-legal way. On a side note Alicia did a great job on the music. :)
1,CD exposes PCs to viruses,"This CD contains MediaMax DRM copy protection which exposes all PCs to viruses. This CD installs software to a user's PC EVEN if the user answers ""No"" to the End User License.Stay away from all Sony CDs with MediaMax software - otherwise risk corruption of your computer. Hopefully, Sony will do the right thing and recall these 6 Million+ CDs before they do any more harm. (Sony already recalled the other 4 Million CDs that contained XCP spyware.)"
2,The Girl Needs Some Vocal Rest!!!,One of the most important things before a live show is to make sure that you have your vocal chords nice and rested. This entire cd is good but Alicia's voice is shot. Hoarse vocals lead to bad recordings but luckily Alicia still had her other talents to save this cd from being a total failure.
5,A very good live album,"I love it, bought it today. Most stand out cut is ""Unbreakable"" and ""Love It Or Leave It Alone"". The live songs are great has ""Karma"" sounded any better live?"
4,very talented musical artist,"we know most of the songs from the first 2 albums so I will give opinions on the several new songsunbreakable has perfect vocals and a good melody but overplaying it gets on my nerves. Wild Horses is ruined by non singing adam levine though the piano intro was promising. Streets of New York is a musical genius with live instruments recreating the sounds of new york through musical instruments, beautifulI have yet to buy this concert on dvd but when I do I'm sure it'll be great"
2,Overrated vocalist,"She has the looks and the personality for this industry but this Unplugged Album does not show-case her vocal ability. She needs to grow vocally and she hasn't yet. ""Unbreakable"" sucks. Too chessy. I was expecting her to really vocally step up her game but she can't. I give this album 2 stars just for effort only. Expected more from her vocally. MTV is happy however, instant cash. The music industry thinks we are dumb. She needs to work on her lack of indentity, vocal range, and originality."
5,Rare reggae collection delivers the goods,"I purchased this collection on tape back when it came out and played the heck out of it for years. After many years had gone by I found the CD version which had a few more songs on it than the tapes had. After those became unplayable due to too many scratches I've again found my little darling collection again (now I digitized it). Practically every track is a bonafide roots classic, with a handful being fairly rare except to collectors. The only problem with this fine collection is the sound quality... it's pretty poor. I would've given it less stars due to that but it's just too good to do that!"
5,Unknown Gem,"I vaguely remembered the disaster that this movie was based on. Instead of a ""Titanic"" type movie, what I found was a gripping personal story about two ordinary people with extraordinary guts as they went up against powerful forces in their quest to learn the truth behind the sinking. Without giving away the plot, this was no natural disaster. The filmaking was a mixture of objective reality and newsreel type footage which was seemlessly integrated. Well worth a look."
5,Suspenseful Movie Sees All Angles,"The thing I most appreciated about Baltic Storm was that the film enabled me to see this tragedy from several different perspectives. From the perspective of the survivors, the community, and the perpetrators. This film shows the dangers of blind patriotism, and some people in our adminstration would do well to see it. The acting is intense and the pace is relentless. Highly recommended."
3,Huge flying UFO's as seen by pilots,"This video is poorly put together , jumping all over the placebut contains many informative unexplained sightings. The UFO'sdo exist and there are many sighting that are not reported becauseof the peer pressure. This video is food for thought!"
2,Pre-Trib Propaganda,"Just more pre-trib propaganda. There is not a single verse in the Bible that says the Rapture will be before the Tribulation. In fact Jesus told us the very opposite (read Matthew 24:29-31 very carefully). Revelation 20:4,5 tells us that the saints martyred in the Tribulation will be in the First Resurrection. The First Resurrection is the RAPTURE! The Rapture is obviously after the Tribulation! It's time to wake up and accept the truth. Place your trust in Jesus Christ not in fictional escapism."
4,Great book!,"A bit rushed and compressed in places, but overall an excellent title. Not for the faint-of-heart. You'd better know a bit of programming (at least for the logic) before you tackle this one."
2,Terrible print quality,The content of the book is great.The print quality is terrible. It looks like the publisher tried to save on ink by not fully printing letters. By this I mean that if you look close you can see white (no-ink) dots within all the letters. Very annoying and disappointing.
5,School House Rock - ROCKS!,I'm always singing the lyrics to some of these to my grandbaby without remembering them correctly. I played it for her the other night. Her eyes lit up and she giggled as she heard the songs I had attempted to sing. Now she can watch and listen to them. What a great time we had. My son learned these when they were on TV as originals. This is a great learning tool and I recommend it to everyone with young kids!
5,Great DVD Series,We ordered this Schoolhouse Rock series to use in the education of our children. We remember these when we were children and thought it would be a great series to use for the next generation. The kids love them and already sig along to some of the songs.
5,As good as it was 25 years ago!!!!! Great!!!!,I watched School House Rock with my children when they were young and it's just as good now as it was then!!!! I love it. Now my grand children and my girl friends grand daughter are going to enjoy it!!!!
4,Great Educational Tool!,"Our whole family loves this DVD. It's a great tool to learning the basics. From the preamble, to the westward expansion to ""Where the Money Goes,"" this is a great selection of videos to have on the shelf. Everyone will love it. Catchy tunes and great info!"
5,School House Rock,This DVD set is great for memorization. Kids want to do extra school with this product everyday.
5,Great learning tool,As a language arts teacher I have used an old video of Grammar Rock for well over 15 years... the tape finally wore out and I invested in this new version. Everything on the tape is educational so it makes a great filler for days in which you need to come up with a quick educational activity.
5,Love it,I bought this to have for my son. Although he is only nine months he recognizes the melodies because we have it playing in the background as music. It is amazing that when we cries we just have to sing one of the jingles and he smiles.
4,Schoolhouse Rock,I really enjoyed this. It brings back wonderful memories.The one negative of the cd is the preview of upcoming vids by Disney. It is cumbersome to go through.
5,Reliving Schoolhouse Rock All Over Again!!,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this DVD. I bought it as soon as it was issued! I thought I was buying it for my 3-year-old son (who already loves the Audio CD Grammar Rock), but I find myself with him, singing and dancing along to these educational music videos.My son asks to see this every day, and I feel encouraged to let him watch something so enjoyable, that will teach him SOO much. I can't believe my son has already memorized lots of these, and can sing ""Conjunction, Junction"" just as well as I can!The guys that created Schoolhouse Rock were geniuses. The 46 complete song-set was more than enough - but the ""lost song"", Scooter Computer, and the Emmy featurette and documentary are what REALLY make this a GREAT buy for grownups, kids, and grown-up kids."
5,Awesome,"I had the very good fortune of seeing a preview of ""gonna send your vote to college"". In case you need a hint, this song was written in the wake of the 2000 election cycle. I was very impressed with it, as well as all the other songs/cartoons in the collection. A sure to be welcome addition to the DVD is a behind the scenes of how they went about recording this song, who all was involved, Jack Sheldon (I'm Just a Bill) does the singing. All of the original crew from schoolhouse rock was involved, except the original animator, but his son does a wonderful job. These folks helped a lot of kids of my generation learn history, grammar, math, and science. I don't recite the Preamble to the Constitution anymore, I sing it. George Newall & Co. strikes another hit."
5,Memories new and old,"I bought this set because it reminded me of my childhood. I played it for my kids and they loved it as much as I did. The animation isn't as crystal clear as what is produced today, but it's fun and lively and educational.And if you aren't careful, you'll be humming parts of it all day long at work....""Interplanet Janet, she's a galaxy girl...."""
5,A Welcome Blast From the Past,I grew up with these as a kid and now I can share ALL of them with my children. Some clips are a little dated but on the whole this is more fun than I even remembered. In the age of Sponge Bob and Bratz it is nice to see that children can be engaged by even complicated concepts if they are delivered in clever and imaginative ways. You'll be humming the songs for days.
5,For my grand children who were not exposed to school house rocks' teaching tunes.,They are enjoying it. I wanted to give them something educational and that their parents will relate to since they grew up when School House Rock was on TV.
4,love it,you know you want it. you loved it as a kid and its at a great price. wife uses it in her class room
5,super fast and super great!,got here really fast and product was just as described in shopping guide. I am very pleased with this edition of school house rock.. thanks!
3,"Cheesy, classic and just plain great! Oh, the 70's flashbacks!","It's too bad they don't come up with an updated Schoolhouse Rocks. But honestly, would we want them to? I just have in mind the future generation.Schoolhouse Rocks shows us how dumb our kids are. Dumb. Oh, and us adults too. Is there any wonder that our educations system is on a rapid decline? If the kids can get past some of the dated stuff on this dvd I think they can come to enjoy them and learn the difference between an adverb, conjunction and adjective. I certainly remember all my favorites and curiously some of the bits drew a blank for me. No matter, I learn, you learn, we can all learn and that's all that matters.Not the greatest quality from VHS to DVD transfer but all the catchy little ditties you remember. Oh, the memories! I hated the menu, it so annoying to get around but who cares? You can't buy memories like this. Great walk down memory lane."
5,Who can forget Schoolhouse Rock!,"Now doesn't this remind you of those great Saturday morinings a long time ago? Schoolhouse Rock is a classic. When I first ordered this, I convinced myself that I was getting it for the kids. Well, I think I've watched it more than they have! Great songs, cute cartoons, and it has that nostalgic appeal that the 30+ generation will appreciate. Excellent DVD for the young, and uhhhhh, the old. Lol!DJ Come of Age"
1,No Electoral Map,So mad! Ordered this as a gift to a friend and the electoral map wasn't included! Tried to get this in time for election day and it did not include map. Sucks!
3,so-so,"My son lost interest after 20 minutes,while my daughter watched longer, it made her go to sleep."
2,Great for PreSchoolers Only,"This product does not seem to keep school age children enthralled in the learning process, even though that is what the intent was. If your child is older than 7, I doubt they will like this."
5,L-O-V-E IT!!!!!,"I grew up knowing most songs from Schoolhouse Rock. This DVD really brings back memories. And more importantly, the lessons that are learned by the end of each song are way cool.Perhaps I am stuck back in my childhood days; but I am looking forward to sharing this with my 1 1/2 year old daughter. Each song has a way with sneaking in something educational without the child realizing the true value. Before you know it, your kid is singing along and saying ""Hey! This is taught in school."""
5,School House Rock! ROCKS!,I grew up on School House Rock! and I remember as a senior in high school taking the NY State Regents exam singing the preamble to the Constitution under my breath as I wrote it out on the test. Flash forward 26 years and my Psychology professor and I sang it out loud in a class to demonstrate how music can be used to fix information in the human memory. I bought the VHS 18 years ago for my son and he can still sing every episode. I purchased this DVD collection for my 1 year old niece. I firmly believe it gives pre-school age children a fun way to learn fundamental concepts and gives them a head start for school.
4,Fun,"It is funny how far production quality has come in 30 years. Still fun for me and my wife to share with my 9 year old. He said, ""That's kinda cool."" Big praises from him."
5,Always in style,"I loved these little cartoons when I was a kid. I bought this for my 3 year old grandson. He was so fascinated with it, he watch through half of a 16 hour road trip, and wants his mother to play it for him again."
5,Gift-she loved it!,"GOt this as a gift for my little sister, and she LoVES it! Watches it all the time, includes all the songs SHR ever made! Would def recommend"
4,pure joy,"what a sheer joy to recieve this double cd in australia..jack sheldon.bob dorough,dave frisberg,blossom dearie and possibly a few others of jazz heratige;all adding their distinctive voices and delivery to a bunch of early primary school lyrics with a purpose..blossoms ""figure 8"" is a masterpiece of childish innocence enhanced by simple animation (the upturned nose on the little schoolgirl) while the irreplaceable jack sheldon in ""conjunction junction "" is still alive and singing in los angeles to this day.,by the way if you ever have the opportunity to visit the annual deleware water gap ""celebration of the arts"" in september you can expect to hear bob dorough presiding over the childrens tent!!..a hardy lot these jazz icons....."
5,Schoolhouse Rocks,Great way for students to remember some grammar rules. Catchy tunes that are timeless.
5,To be a kid again,This video seriously takes me back a few years. My children were surprised when their 40 year old mother could still recite the Preamble and it was because of this video. Remember when cartoons taught you real life lessons and didn't always involve space aliens?
4,"Love this, but not all shows are on disk 1","I always have and always will love School house rock. The only problem I have with this is that I like to select the ""Enchilata Spice"" option, all of the shows in mixed order. Since ""Weather"", and ""Scooter Computer"" are on disk 2, we never get to see these without changing disks, which is rare. There are at least 6 disney commercials on disk 1, so if these were removed, these 4 shows (actually 5, from what another review said) could have been put on disk 1."
3,quality,I loved looking at the old school rock but the sound was very low and we had to be very quiet in order to hear it.
3,Use to love,I use to watch this on saturday mornings and loved it! but i got this and dont remember it being so BORING! Im hoping my daughter will find the enjoyment like I did years ago. I guess because Im older cartoons bore me alot. lol
2,keeps freezing,I was disappointed in the quality of the product. The CD keeps freezing during certain points.
3,Schoolhouse Rock!,"Most school do not teach this any more, it's imforamtion for all student's. I would buy more educational dvd's from Schoolhouse Rock"
3,Not what I hoped...,"The product arrived in record time; however, it was not what I expected, and that's not Amazon's fault. I already own the VHS copy of the Top 25 Schoolhouse Rock songs, and thought I was missing something. Sadly I was not. The only positive is that the Multiplication Rock portion of it will help my daughter learn her multiplication tables much faster through song."
4,Old memories good television,I learned a lot from these videos. I hope my granddaughters learn a lot from them as well.
5,OH SWEET MEMORIES!!!,"This is a good dvd set to not only remember the good times of childhood, but to teach your grandchildren about grammer and math etc. I'm watching it now and I remember The Preamble Song. I seen it when I was about 7 but when I took the constitution test in 8th grade and had to write The Preamble, I remembered the song and got an A+ on the test. This set is for everyone."
5,School House Rock,This edition has both grammar and science. I like being able to use the specific topic easily.
5,Superior for the Classroom,"As a reviewer, I cannot add more to the long and very excellent discussion of the ""Schoolhouse Rock"" cartoons. As a teacher, however, I can say that not only are these little gems entirely appropriate to the classroom, but a wonderful vehicle still for teaching the ""basics"" of language, the parts of speech, and the workings of government. I would strongly recommend them."
5,DO YOU REMEMBER?,"LOVE THIS STUFF. GREAT CONDITION! NOT ONLY CAN I REVISIT THE STUFF I DON'T REMEMBER BUT LISTEN TO SOME GREAT TUNES WITHOUT THE CURSING,ETC... :-P"
5,Always a Treat,"These educational cartoonettes are always fun to watch. This particular DVD has all the lessons I remember as a child. The main menu is super cute, too."
5,love these songs!,"I grew up watching these spots during Saturday morning cartoons. They are clever, catchy, and you learn stuff, too! What more could you ask?"
5,Big Fun!,"I really love this DVD. It's wonderful having all the 'rocks'in one place! You can play them linearly, or randomly, or by category. I'm enjoying the heck out of it ... and I'm almost sixty! (Supposedly I bought it for my autistic son. He loves it too.)"
4,"Great content, but defective DVDs","My husband, toddler son, and I love this set for all the reasons mentioned in almost every review listed. We have encountered a problem, however, that I haven't seen addressed. Our first copy was so glitchy, it was mostly unwatchable. We exchanged it for a new copy, which is also extremely glitchy. We have a new, high quality DVD player and many new DVDs. This is the only one with any problems.Perhaps we are just unlucky, but I am wondering if some of the reviewers who reported difficulty with navigation (IE skipping the ads) also have bad copies.I'd definitely give 5 stars if it weren't for the poor quality of the DVD."
5,Yeah,I truly enjoy School House Rock. I love sharing these with our son. He enjoys watching them. The product came in the condition presented (New) and I recommend it.
4,It rocks!,"Memories of Saturday morning cartoons abound - 70's retro style! Funky little tool for the classroom, making learning fun. Love it!"
5,Love School House Rock !,This is a great! If you watch this with your kids it can really help them get interested in learning about things that otherwise would be really BORING! But even after they know the songs you will still have to explain to them what they are singing. It is a Great learning tool!
5,A Winner!,"I was excited to get the 30th edition of the Schoolhouse Rock songs. I remembered them fondly from my childhood. So, I just knew my almost 9 y/o son would love it. When we first played it, he was less than thrilled. His first reaction to things is generally like that. However, he has played the songs numerous times and I often find him dancing around the house while singing them. An even bigger hit with him are the trivia games on one of the DVDs. He'll work on those for hours if I let him. I think learning, for the most part, should be fun. Schoolhouse Rock fits that bill!"
5,Passing it on the next generation of Americans :),"AMAZING BUY!!! I still remember the days when my grade school teacher would play these each and every morning! Now, I'm passing it on to my girlfriends daughter, and she loves it!! You'll hear her singing along, playing it each morning when she's gettting ready for school..."
5,The grandkids love it!!,We purchased this for our grandchildren to enjoy. We watched with them and had every bit as much fun as they did. These are still a GREAT teaching tool.
1,I'm Disappointed.,"I was soooo excited to get this home and play it because I grew up listening to these cartoon segments every Saturday morning! But it bored me. They just weren't as good as I remembered them, I guess. I ended up fast forwarding through most of it. I paused for the classics ""I'm only a Bill"" etc, but I didn't seem to recognize most of them anymore.If you're looking to relive a little childhood, rent it first- then if you think you can live with it, buy it. Perhaps you need to check to be sure you recognize more than 1/2 of the titles too. (I 'thought' I did!) -I personally wish I had my money back. (My kids even begged me to shut it off!) Just my opinion...hope it helps those of you looking to purchase it.)1smileycat :-)"
1,School House Rock! (Special Anniversary Edition),DVD arrived in a timely manner; however once I inserted the DVD in it would not play. The DVD made a lot of strange sounds but never showed a picture nor gave a clear sound.Dissapointed:-(
1,encoding problem with DVD,"I was really looking forward to sharing my favorite memories of Schoolhouse Rock with my two daughters, ages 6 and 4. However, the DVDs I received were marred by encoding problems from the manufacturer. I attempted to replace the disc 2x but was unable to find a copy that could play successfully in DVD player."
1,Schoolhouse Rock! (Special 30th Anniversary Edition),I couldn't get this program to work; I concluded that it is incompatible with Windows XP.
1,Schoolhouse Rock! really rocks!!,"This was a lot of fun to watch again, I remembered most of the words from when I was a child. Now I used it to help my family learn in that same fun way. I would recommend this to people of all ages!"
1,Not what I expected,This is not up to date...the songs are old and my kids were not excited by it. the words are sung SO fast you can't even really understand what they are saying. unhip.
1,SICK MOVIE can I rate ((0)) STARS!!!!!!,I thought I was buying a movie & it turned out to be some stupid little school kids music video. I was very disapointed. I felt like I through my money right in the garbage. What in the heck is disney trying to get away with. Don't buy this DVD unless you have toddlers around!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!
5,"Schoolhouse Rock 30th Anniv. DVD ""Rocks""","Schoolhouse Rock! (Special 30th Anniversary Edition)This DVD brought back so many memories. I loved Schoolhouse Rock when I was growing up and now I plan to pass this fun way of learning down to my neices and nephews. The seller did everything they said they would, I got the DVD in perfect condition and on time as stated in the ad. It's a beautiful thing when you get exactly what you were promised. This will keep me coming back to Amazon time after time!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"The best in ""educational"" learning.","These cartoon shorts from the eighties are abosolutely essential today. With budget shortfalls claiming each school system's level of teaching each day, these short cartoon's touch on the basis of what we want our kids to learn.And they do so in an entertaining manner that still works in this technological era.If you watch these shorts, I'm sure you'll agree.Actually I challenge you not too!!"
5,Very educational yet interesting songs,"Good to have subtitles for all the songs, but it would be best if lyrics of all the songs come with the DVD."
5,When learning was fun!,"If these types of educational products were mainstream today, then kids could read and have fewer troubles with academics."
5,Very satisfied customer,"DVD was in pristine condition. It actually arrived a couple days ahead of the estimated delivery. The songs and characterizations were just as I remembered them, excellent. This has been a wonderful tool for helping my elementary aged children remember the rules of grammar, significant people and important events in history, important science discoveries, etc. An excellent buy."
5,Pleased with format,"I was concerned before I ordered this DVD that it would be hard to find and view individual songs based on what another reviewer had written. As a teacher, this was important to me because I planned to used this DVD to supplement what I was teaching. Although you must go through several menus to find them, you can play just individual songs, or all the songs in one category, such as grammar. It will work perfectly in the classroom and I recommend it to other teachers and parents."
5,Schoolhouse Rocks!,"Excellent DvD. My kids love it, they keep watching it over and over again.I used to watch it on TV when I was A kid and I still like it!"
5,Super Product,My students have been so inspired to learn more about parts of speech and the science protion that I no longer hear the groans what I ask them to identify they parts of speech of their spelling words. As they are using their multiplication tables and homework I often hear the tunes being hummed for the multiplications rock. Thank you for having this product. It continues to be a great asset for each generations.
5,Schoolhouse Rock still ROCKS!!,"As good as I remember from when I was a kid in the 70's...only BETTER becuz now I get it! HA! My 2 year old son even likes it. I would recommend this DVD to anyone...to everyone! Music, grammar, education...does it get any better??"
5,Classic!,"I am replacing my old VHS tapes, because over the course of 24 years, my kids are STILL watching--and wearing them out! Simplicity and pure genius at work with our educational system. No wonder I'm raising a bunch of retro-kids who are surpassing their peers based on BASICS and not ""super-curriculums""! ""Verb"", ""Naughty Number Nine"", ""Interjections"", and ""Mother Necessity"" are my favorites, tho' I love em' all!"
5,Great DVD,"If you liked school house rock as a kid, then you will like this dvd and so will your kids/grandkids. It's fun to watch and reminisce."
5,Schoolhouse Rock!,"How cute and how fun it was to watch. Although I didn't care for the menu setup (especially on how to play each segment), it still didn't take away from the overall good time I had watching them. I give this seller an A++ for prompt shipping and excellent playing quality of the dvds. I'd recommend this seller for anyone looking for dvds."
5,Still amazing after all these years!,"Back in the 70s, I learned a lot about grammar, math and the Constitution from these short cartoons. Watching them again after 30 years, they are compact and entertaining miracles, combining catchy tunes with a surprisingly large amount of information. I plan to give a number of these as Christmas gifts to people with children. Leave your kids in front of the TV with this DVD, and they will likely surprise you with how fast they pick this stuff up."
5,An All Time Classic,My Children loved it when they were growing up. Now I bought it for my grandchilren. They love it too!
5,Do It For Your Kids! A True Classic!,It is a shame that more attention has not brought to this DVD. I am a older person and some of the episodes did get me through my early education. I just hope when I do have a child I can share these DVD's with him or her.
5,Just as fun as you remember,"I loved the School House Rock series when I was growing up in the 70's. By third grade, I was a whiz at times tables. I bought this DVD for my daughter. She's still kind of young, but she loves the songs and the short lengths of each segment are just long enough to keep it interesting. I'm fully expecting that she will be a math and english whiz as well by the time she reaches elementary school."
5,GREAT LEARNING FUN,"I am so happy to have rediscovered these great clips that introduce in a funny and easy way how to learn your numbers and verbs and nouns. It brought back such a time in my life where things were simple, I LOVE IT AND YOU WILL TOO."
3,Brings back memories..,Got this item for several reasons as I was a huge fan of school house rock and figured Id share with the kids as the songs are great for learning little things. DVD Is great but the audio could have been better..
5,Classic,It has them all. The grammar hits and the history classics. So great! It arrived early and went directly into the dvd player.
5,Schoolhouse Rock,"Awesome teaching tool, children can learn from this without realizing it is even a teaching tool. My own grown children watched this on television years ago and I bought this for my Grandchildren. Need more learning tools like this, it makes learning fun."
2,not as complete as I'd like it to be,My 9yr old popped the DVD right in when it arrived. She's heard all my stories about how much I felt I'd learned with the help of Schoolhouse Rock. We watched and sang together. I think she got a kick out of it. Some of my favorites were totally left out! The 9's and 7's - 6's... were not in there. I assumed that since it was an anniversary editions that they wouldn't leave anything out. I was disappointed by that.
5,School House Rock Video,"Such a terrific gem from the past. I purchased several copies to give to people as ""baby"" gifts. It's a classic!"
5,Fun and Educational,My son has loved this dvd from the moment we bought it. He has requested watching it over and over again. And the great thing is it is teaching him about our history and many other pertinent things.
2,Too many Unskippable Ads,"There were around 30 minutes of ads at the beginning of the DVD for loads of kids movies, and we couldn't skip them!We finally got through them, but by that time, the kids' attention was lost. We never got to finish the DVD, and we're afraid to start it over again since we don't want to get into all those ads again!Other than that, the DVD is as advertised, and most of the episodes that we saw are still as fun and educational as when I was a kid.This looks like a great DVD for the kids, but watch out for the excessive marketing!"
3,"Love Schoolhouse Rock, not this product so much.",I bought this to use with my kids but it has been a difficult item to use for specific songs. I won't give up on Schoolhouse Rock but will have to go another product to have what I want.
4,Good deal!,I love the product - our 2-year old can watch them. The menu program is a little cumbersome as you have to go through it completely each time if you want the shuffle program. The product is good though and still catchy as I remember seeing on saturday mornings.
4,Old learning tools still work!,"I'm very pleased to have found this School House Rock dvd! My kids 11 & 6 actually sit, jump, and sing ""together peacefully"" enjoying the shows!"
5,School House ROCKS!,"I loved it when I was a kid, and I still remember many of the words (conjunction junction, what's your function...) and now my kids are singing it! I know everyone says that, but I have an 11-year old, a 4 year-old and a 9 year old- who has Autism. All the kids LOVE it, but the 9 year-old is completely smitten- he watches it every day after school. It has done WONDERS for him on his muliplication tables. Because many autistic children are drawn to music, this is a great way to teach without tears. I ordered an extra copy for school, and gave a copy to my friend with a special needs child. WELL WORTH THE $[...] each! I would have paid TWICE that for the 2 DVD sets, which are organized by subject."
4,Nice and spicy,"I was tired of the same old taste from all the other hot sauce, so decided to try this. Nicely surprised at how spicy it was. Did not give 5 stars since its a bit costly for hot sauce."
5,One of the best hot sauces in the world,"This is the primary hot sauce I seek out to add some spice to my food. It has a robust habanero taste which is balanced perfectly with the garlic. Great for adding to salsa for a spicy kick. Be warned, this is a fairly hot one!"
3,dassapointed,"I enjoy the green hot sauces so I came on amazon and read the reviews of various different brands and after reading the favorable reviews for this I went down to the grocery and got a bottle. It was a little hotter that I was expecting but not overly so, what I was really disappointed in was the total lack of flavor. I put quite a bit on a beef sandwich and I can feel the burn but I can't taste much of anything. I put more on and still nothing. I then tried some straight I could sort of taste a peppery flavor but not reallyI really suspect many of the favorable reviews may be sellers as it seems unlikely so many people would rave over the flavor of something thats practically tasteless.This is a cheap sauce that is easy to pick up locally by most Americans so there would be people who would sell this on here and collect on the pricy shipping charges not having to keep much of if any in stock."
4,killer hot sauce!,"This hot sauce is great. Spicy but not too spicy, you can really taste the green chilies and Habenero, and what an amazing color! I love using this stuff."
2,"No technical details, bias suggestions, too much text","I am disappointed about this book mainly because (1) there is no technical discussion about the setup of storefront and payment gateway (2) the authors recommend advertiser's services...kind of bias (3) it does not cover all the latest technologies, despite the fact that it's published in Sep 1999! (4) there is too much unnecessary text with repetitive info and most importantly (5) I still don't know how to set up an e-commerce solution on a dedicated hosting platform, after reading this 394 pages book in a week. If you are reading Business 2.0 or Inter@active week already, don't buy this book. However, if you are new to e-com and want to get a quick grasp of the major components, this book may help you."
2,Not a thrilling novel,"The inside flap purports that a ""devastating secret"" is uncovered and when I finished the novel I still couldn't figure out what the horrid secret was. It was simply a story about a love affair brought together and torn apart by music. It's a quick read, but I found the dialogue to be clunky. I felt that Lydia (the student/lover)did not receive enough attention. I think there were characters in the novel that were close to her, other than Bernard (the music teacher)who could have been used more to illuminate Lydia's strange actions."
2,Where have all the editors gone?,"I give this two stars instead of one so as not to have the devastating effect an unfavorable review in the story has. Just kidding; actually I give it three stars for content, one star for execution. Yes, as several of the reviews here state, the dialogue just doesn't come off. It IS ""clunky""; it IS stilted. Everything about the book seems amateurish. On the other hand, this is a first novel, and its author is professionally a musician, not a writer. You have to start somewhere. I think the real problem is that this book needed to be refashioned in collaboration with an experienced, talented editor, and nowadays money-games-playing stockholders consider editors an expense corporate publishing companies can do without. In any case, I read it in one sitting, and overall I enjoyed it."
4,unique story line,"The baby that needed a home and the best friend that very unexpectedly committed suicide provide an unusual plot. It was a good read, but I thought that the ending was too rushed."
4,A Pleasant Read if You are Not Expecting a Prize Winner,"This story was written in 1993, so the author's romance novel beginnings are still very obvious. But in this novel she demonstrates good character development, complex multiple story lines, and a great maturation of her writing skills. As several other reviewers have stated already, there's a little too much ""here's what's wrong with the woman"" and ""here's the man to fix it all"" going on. But in this novel there is at least one man who finds the woman who turns him into a caring individual. I liked the small town atmosphere and the mystery that runs throughout the story, although there is a loose end that never gets tied up (at least not for this reader). I did experience some reflection on my own life as one of the characters could well be me. So even though it really is just a good rainy day read, you too might learn a little about yourself. Don't expect great literature; just enjoy the story."
5,Suddenly,Like most of Barbara Delinsky's books I found this to be a very interesting story - I look foward to reading more of her books.
4,B & B,"Actually, I expected some kind of improvisations on Bach's music but I can't say I'm disapointed.The first CD - Bach's Concerto For 2 Piano's played by the Paratore brothers and Brubeck's ""Points On Jazz"" played by the Paratore brothers together with the Brubeck Quartet and The Bach Colegium Music-has a classical sound, even Brubeck's composition sounds more classical than jazz.The 2nd CD is more jazzy, although The Bach Colegium Music gives a classical touch to the music(see ""Branderburg Gate Revisited"") and has a great new live version of ""Take Five""(fantastic drums solo).In my opinion this live album might appeal to Brubeck fans who want to get more into his classical side and also to classical music fans who like jazz too.So if you're in the mood for some swinging classical music or some jazz with a classical touch get yourself this record, you won't regret it."
5,A great FAQ,"This book is not all-inclusive, you should get Jeff Prosise's ""Programming Windows with MFC"" if you are looking for that. Instead, Kain's book is really the answers to the most frequent, irritating, and time-wasting little problems one finds while programming in MFC. This book should not really be necessary, except that MFC is so badly designed that little things that should be easy to do often end being a great waste of time, while the programmers search for the clumsy and roundabout way out. Should be in every MFC programmer's bookshelf."
5,Best MFC Starter book out there,"I bought this around 1999, long after I started programming in MFC. The one regret I had was not buying this book sooner. Just the format alone of this book is priceless. The question-answer format makes it very easy to find things and makes a great quick reference with good examples. I am writing this review almost 6 years later because this book still helped me out a lot even after years of writing MFC stuff. The great thing about the book is it covers a lot of MFC material and hits on things you may not use day to day.If you are a beginning MFC programmer or even intermediate, this is the book for you."
3,Some pretty good tricks,"If you are looking for details about MFC this is NOT the book to buy. If you are looking for some ""tricks"" well then maybe this will work for you. The book is well enough written but lacks some detail about how the code works. But I am not an expert on MFC. If I could I would add 1/2 star to the 3 I gave."
5,"Great book...write us a ""sequel"", Eugene!","Every other reviewer pretty much said it all. This book uses a unique formula that presents a list of questions and directs you to the answers. Each answer gives a brief explanation of how to do something, followed by step-by-step directions to get the job done quickly. You don't have to read a whole book to learn how to enhance your applications. I had a few comments for the author and e-mailed him at the address given in the book. His reply came within a day or two...it was nice to see that he cared enough about my opinion to reply! I have many more questions, Eugene. How about ""More MFC Answers""?"
4,Cute,I was quite suprised at how fast the product arrived. My grand-daughter has watched the show over and over. CUTE CUTE CUTE CUTE
4,A Great Introduction to the Amazing Career of the Big E!,"This is an excellent book on the first aircraft carrier Enterprise. The Big E was the most decorated ship of World War II and had a charmed life. She fought in nearly all of the major naval battles in the Pacific and was awarded 20 battle stars by the government. The Enterprise was also the ONLY carrier operating in the Pacific for a time during the war. This book has good photos and the information is detailed, without being overwhelming for a basic book. (It is really an introduction to the subject and left me wanting more.) The cost of the book is quite low for so much content. The author brings across his love of the Enterprise and makes you cringe when plans to preserve the ship as a museum fall apart and the ship is scrapped."
4,Finally a roll of tubular bandage that is long enough!,"I have been going through the drug store bought bandages and they are short and expensive! This roll is great as it lasts a number of dressings. I have bought more of this item as well. Worked really well. Although I did use an applicator from another brand as the one here is not the best(thus 4 stars, not 5), it will work though. This is the smaller size which I like for my son's smaller fingers."
3,Adequate,A little on the thin side but adequate for holding bandaging over wound when a non sterile wrapping is needed.
5,Tested product to see how it would hold up.,"Have to change Mother's wound on a daily basis, tried this because of it's lower price. Works fine when used with thicker gauze pads. By itself a little on the thin side to be used by itself for my purposes."
3,"Fairly nice introduction, for what this costs.","Learn to play keyboard, by Mike Taylor, is a 32 minute video, with a 1 page reference sheet enclosed. Listed at $9.99 at the time of my review, expect a brief introduction to the subject at this price. His coverage of the specialized keys on a keyboard is quite brief. He does a fairly good job of showing you the standard piano keys A-G, and the musical notes on the music staff. He attempts to show you how to play a tune or two, but for me this part of the video was too briefly done to be effective."
5,Very cute pendant.,"Shiny substantial piece. Nice size, not a tiny charm like those for charm bracelets. Just as pictured."
4,It works,"It was easy to get back into excercising and bottom line is it works for me. I agree with other reviews that he doesn't explain the excercise before he does it. Also, the camera work is not great as they show an excercise from the waist up only to then back away and you see what your legs are supposed to be doing. After the first few times you know though and this work out does work."
3,Pro's and con's...,"I can understand some of the negative reviews of this video. The music, instructor and exercisers are pretty uninspiring, HOWEVER, speaking as a 49 year old woman, who has been running, practicing taekwondo and doing Tae Bo for the last few years, I do see how I might use this video in my own exercise regimen.Despite the fact that I feel I am in pretty decent shape I find that using my advanced Tae Bo videos every other day causes too much fatigue. My recovery time is just too long, and so I lose days that I would like to be exercising. The ""Sexy and Fit.."" video seems to be gentler and more laid back, and might be a good fit for every other workout to keep me from getting too fatigued. This is how I plan to use it. Of course, there are so many videos on the market, those who don't like this one can always choose another! =0)"
4,great on vacation,"I'm 55 years old and also have trouble with bouncy workouts aimed at 20 year old women. I take this DVD with me on trips and play it on my computer. It is easy to get a full body workout in the hotel room in a reasonable amount of time. I don't generally use it at home because I have many that are more challenging. But I do work up a sweat and feel that I've had a good workout when I am confined to a hotel.I was glad to see that someone else didn't like the quality of the DVD -- it skips and stalls. But for the price, I'm VERY happy with it. I don't leave home without it!"
2,Mostly plastic,"I looked for small Siku construction vehicles that I saw at a friend's house, because they were all metal and durable. This truck is mostly plastic - the truck bed, the undercarriage, the wheels, the signs. The only metal seems to be the cab! The signs will surely snap in a first play."
4,Absolute must for all English Civil War enthusiasts.,"What this publication seeks to do is inform the reader of the Typical arms and armour of the period, how they were used, who made them, what they look like and what are their distintive features. the text is supported by a wide variety of photographs ,many black and white and 8 color,Buff coats patterns, Firearms Lock Types, Leather Guns, Cuirassier Armour, Harquebus Armour, Swords, Cavalry Firearms, Pikeman's Armour, for the Scottish Weapon Fans I have to say that they were omitted.This is the first book I bought from the Royal Armouries, fascinating to anyone interested in weapons and equipment of the 17th century Arms and Armour of the ECW armies. the book is only 99 pages but very concise, a very worthwhile volume to add to your library, an absolute must for all English Civil War enthusiasts, armour fans or weapons of the period."
3,Usable but a bit Cheesy,"I gave these as a gift and I was actually a little embarrased to give them, yeah, they fit the seats and all, but they were a little cheesy. The fabric is thin and the word ""Racing"" is embroidered onto everything- how lame is that?"
5,Excellent eighties!,"This is a must if you collect various artists albums. SOMEBODY'S KNOCKIN' was Terri Gibbs' only Top 20 hit on both the pop/rock and country charts. AMANDA was one of the most recent hits for Boston in 1986,from their THIRD STAGE album. SISTER CHRISTIAN performed by Night Ranger was a major hit in 1984 from their MIDNIGHT MADNESS album. I'LL TUMBLE 4 YA is from Culture Club's 1982 debut,KISSING TO BE CLEVER. The other songs are great. I,myself,am a lover of eighties music,living through that decade from age 8 to 18. Also on this collection is the MIAMI VICE THEME from the popular NBC crime drama starring Don Johnson and Jan Michael Vincent. We will always remember the sound of digital percussion from the 1980's. In fact,it continued until 1992. I know because it is heard on Elton John's THE ONE album,released that year."
1,"Instructions, none. Support, haven't found it.","This may be a good product, it's hard to say. You receive the disk and some check paper. Then your on your own. There are help menues you can print out but no booklet, pamphlet, tutorial, guide or manual to follow through and learn. The help number on there website; not toll free. All I got from the four times I called was what sounded like a home answering machine. No one called me back, but if the had it would cost me 60 dollars to answer my question if it took more than 6o seconds on the phone. Pre-paid of course. What else can I say, if you have a similar program you may have a head start on using this check program. Either way, I don't suggest spending the cash on this one."
3,Odd story but good acting,"Not very likable people in this unusual movie, nobody seems to know what they want or where they are going. Monroe really shows some serious acting ability though compared to some of her lighter roles. If you're a film buff you should watch it just because it the last work of both her and Gable."
3,Making of The Misfits,"If you want to find out more about the behind the scenes struggles during the making of The Misfits, check out Curse of the Silver Screen - Tragedy & Disaster Behind the Movies by John W. Law in the book section."
3,Can someone please review the Blu Ray itself?,"Everyone is talking about the movie - we know the movie, I need to know whether this is indeed worth owning on Blu Ray.One of my favorites, and the DVD could have been a better transfer. Did they get it right for the BD?"
2,Wrong film-editorial review!,"This (2001) is a remake of a 1961 movie of the same title. The image is wrong, it is for the 1961 movie!"
2,Sad note to go out on,"Oh, how I wanted to love this movie. It was the last movie for both Gable and Monroe, it was set in the beautiful southwest (Reno to be exact), and it was to be a movie about free-spirits finding each other. The movie started out great, with a great opening scene with Thelma Ritter.Unfortunately, that is the last high point of the movie. In addition to accepting the unbelievable romance between sixty year old Gable and 35-year-old Marilyn, we were supposed to feel something for these characters. Not an easy thing to ask of the viewer. Wallach, Clift and Gable played dispicable, drunken losers, and Marilyn was a woman bereft of any capability to recognize it. These were all people that I wouldn't even bother with if I met them on the street. Why am I supposed to care about them?So sad that Gable and Monroe went out on this note. The only value in seeing this movie is purely historical."
1,Boring,"This film didn't keep my attention at all. I truly think it has been over hyped because it was the last completed film for Gable and Monroe. It was not at all a film I would picture Marilyn Monroe in. That is probably exactly what she wanted, a film allowing her to go beyond and expand her acting credibility... I felt there was more chemistry between Clift & Monroe than Gable & Monroe; so the latter pair being the hook up didn't fly for me. Marilyn Monroe is my absolute favorite but this just wasn't for me. I regret buying it instead of just renting it, as I will never watch it again."
4,Good/Weird/Very Arthur Miller,"This was a very good movie. It was also very weird at times. I was interested in this movie because I knew Aruthr Miller wrote it for Marilyn. The part she played was pretty much based on her, so I wanted to see what his view of her was. It was a good movie, a little weird, sad at times, but thats just Arthur Miller for you. I recommend watching it."
3,Star studded dull movie,"Don't get huffy over the three stars. I would give most movies produced in the last four decades a one star. Written by Arthur Miller, one of Monroe's husbands... If you went to school before the teach to the test paradigm, you were forced to read ""Death of a Salesman."" This is another two hours and five minutes of your life you will never get back. But, consider viewing this film an educational experience, such as reading ""Ivanhoe,"" something you will only do once. Bad behavior and alcoholism may have mirrored, at least in part the lives of the stars. The black and white choice actually adds to the film's credibility. The viewing and audio quality of the DVD was quite acceptable."
4,MM WAS A GREAT ACTRESS,"MARILYN MONROE IS NOT GIVEN THE CREDIT SHE DESERVES. SHE GIVES A WONDERFUL RAW, DRAMATIC PERFORMANCE HERE. WATCH ""SOME LIKE IT HOT"" AND THIS BACK TO BACK AND YOU WILL SEE HER TALANT. SHE CAN MAKE YOU FEEL LAUGHTER OR SADNESS WITH A SINGLE FACIAL EXRESSION. I THINK IF MARILYN WERE AROUND TODAY SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE HAPPIER IN HER CARRER. AFTER ALL PEOPLE WHO KNEW HER ALWAYS SAID SHE WAS ""AHEAD OF HER TIME"""
5,The Final Film For Two Great Actors.,"Note: I just saw this film with XFinity On Demand.Noted for being the final film of screen legends Clark Gable (Best Actor, It Happened One Night) and Marilyn Monroe (Gentlemen Prefer Blondes), The Misfits is an interesting movie. I recommend it, mostly to view the (sadly) final performances of Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe, though Tuco also turns in a good performance, as does Montgomery Clift. But the stars of the film are clearly Rhett Butler and Marilyn Monroe, who was a good actress in addition to being incredibly gorgeous.This film is Not Rated."
4,Classic work,"If you appreciate the old hollywood style of telling a story, this movie is worth watching. It examines the relationship and mores of the time through an observor's view. You aren't tied into the internal thoughts and emotions of the characters, except by what they reveal to everyone. Gable is good as always, not having lost his spark and appeal. Monroe shows the sorrow of a tough life and the rest of the cast carry their roles with conviction."
1,you get what you pay for,"This product didn't last a year, I used it very little and yet it still stopped working in less than a year.You Get What You Pay For"
3,My least favorite Micro,"This is the cd that started all the Tech Mix series,but this one is somewhat lacking.This is another cd I cant let play all the way thru because it's just so inconsistent and not near as good as the other tech mixes.Tech Mix 00'is the best,with 2.0 coming in 2nd place.I dont recommend this mix unless you like boredom in the middle of good music."
4,"Very good selection of housey,trancey,breaks",THis is the cd that opened the doorway to version 2.0....what a way to start it all(tech mix series)...this is one i can listen to over n over again without getting bored!get this one for sure
5,Police proceedural show with good mix of characters,"Season 3 can seem confusing if this is the first season you're watching. The back stories on the characters are well developed and make watching the season 1 & 2 well worth the time. The actors seem to have developed their character's drives and complexities and thus seem real in season 3. I like that each of the main characters is given a chance to show who they are and why they do and react to the same situations that fit their character's personality. There is still the group doing police proceedures as seen from each characters perspective. Some have said it's like the show Grey's Anatomy but I see it more like the Law and Order shows. I enjoy seeing how the characters actions drive the stories each week. The writers have been able to keep season 3 fresh and hopefully this will continue. I appreciate the lack of soap opera cliffhangers that other shows use to keep the viewer ""hooked"". The acting and writing is solid and it's a good show."
1,I like the other episodes. Not this one.,"This episode is too depressing. 1 officer being assualted, ok possible. 2 officers goes directly to depressing. Sorry, un-beliveable and it takes drama and turns it into just a depressing episode. They should have written this better. This ruins drama by being too un-realistic."
1,"I agree, that was horrible.","What a depressing plot. I bought the episode eventho the other reviewr said it was super sad b/c I figured that heck, it couldn't be THAT bad - but it was! Oh yes! It was soooooo bad and soooooo sad and soooooo depressing. I would not recommend it at all and I LOVE this show. Not anymore. Not if other episodes are going to be anything like this one. I couldn't even watch it. I had to fast forward it and it was still horrible. I wish I could get my money back. :("
4,Good stuff,"This show is entertaining. The different personalities of characters keep it interesting. It's fun to watch these rookies grow, even though it is at 'TV pace' there is still some depth there."
5,So good it hurts!,This album is truly transcendent. It is a well-crafted ceremony of heartbreak and life and purpose rediscovered. I would and have recommended this to anyone and everyone.
2,Remembered her name from a Brazil trip,"I bought this album for one song (Amor, Amor) but did recognize some others from my trip. Bottom line, the music just isn't that good. Lots better Brazilian music out there."
4,Good thermal design but one minor flaw,"Pros* Good looking case* Nice Thermal design - Apart from 2 fans, it has an exhaust cup that fits right over the CPU socketCons* The steel frame sockets for keyboard, mouse, audio did not fit my ASUS motherboard (I had to use my old case's frame piece to make it work)Note: This has a 300W power supply so make sure it suffices your computing needs"
4,Solid Case that works fine,"This case serves its purpose and is pretty nice. I am using a full ATX motherboard and it fit with no issues.The case had rudimentary directions. The needed parts were all there. As is common these days, not enough power take-offs to suit my needs but the power supply is not as bad as most in this respect -- I recommend having a few splitters and T-s available if you have a lot of devices.The power supply is very solid.I replaced the original fan because it was too noisy for my taste. Only 1 fan is supplied.Buttons on the front are nice sized. The USB and front speaker connects are too close to the ground. The little door needs to be taken off to make these usable if you place your computer on the ground.The sides work well and the case construction is not sloppy as many cases are these days. It is unfortunate that there is no clear side.Overall, the case and power supply are functional if you want a moderate price."
2,Shaadi Karke Phas Gaya Yaar - DVD,I like the movie but the DVD quality wasn't what I expected.And not as described of the recording studio. They did return my money
5,Campion Mystery Mile,The Campion Series is well written and well made. No Spoiliers. Mystery Mile is a really good english mystery. Peter Davidson is great as Campion. The story is really good based on the novel by Margery Allingham the creator of Campion.This Series is a most for mystery fans!
3,Fluid Mechanics,"This book is very vague in some of the proofs that it contains, however if you have a good understanding of differential equations and some thermodynamics it is fairly easy to follow along, it does make a lot of assumptions that it doesnt explain, so there will be times when you are left scratching your head about a statement they have made, would be nice if it included an index to reference material within the book, i have found it useful in my work (biochemical engineering), however it is not a book i would recommend buying unless you have a working knowledge of the area or someone who does to help you"
3,Biological fluid dynamics - first of its kind,"A honest truth is that, to can understand the concept in this book, you must need the help of an expert like your professor or TA. The material is hard to follow, many of the proofs are incomplete/ or lack adequate steps. The assumptions are not explicity made, which will lead you to ponder on one problem for many hours.But the book has a very nice mixture of engineering concepts (fluid dynamics) and its biological relavance, the first of its kind. Although conceptiouly it is very hard, the mathematical models presented are phenomenal and are presented with great care. To be sucessfully in the course, you must need a good balance in both attending the lectures as well as reading the book."
5,must read,"Searing, visceral stuff - the story of betrayal upon betrayal, and of how a nation was ground into dust and doggedly refused to stay there. The Serbian retreat across the winter mountains, under pressure from three separate war fronts and abandoned by those they believed were their allies, is a tragic and epic one. Here are some of the very deepest roots of the history of the embattled Balkans. A must-read."
5,The moral is ...,"This book has received so much mileage in our family, and extended family. Nobody dares say ""I don't care"", for fear of the rest of the family barking out ""Pierre's in there"", or some similar verse.The book is small enough to lose in the bookshelf for a few years and then rediscover in some cleaning frenzy, to read again and laugh once more at the rhyming masterpiece.I have bought this book as gifts for all my nieces and nephews, and for virtually every small child I know. They all love it.The moral really is: CARE!"
2,Good Easy Reader -- Not Much For Storyline,"Might be good for an early reader, as many phrases are repetitious; however, my daughter grew bored with the 'story'. Maybe we were expecting too much? Also, the price for a 5"" by 4"" paperback seemed excessive."
3,A lesion for brats,What can I say: there isn't much to it.Getting eaten by a lion for being a rotten kidprobably can serve as a lesion?I don't care! ( humor)
5,Fantastic! TEACHER'S PLEASE READ!,"I am the school librarian in an elementary school in California. (a wonderful, if not well paying job) At the end of every school year, I SING this book to EVERY class for their last library visit...the children get to sing the I Don't CARE! parts. (Watch the video ""Really Rosie"" with lyrics and music by Carol King to learn the way it is sung) It is a JOY. The next year, all the kids want to know..""Can I check out Pierre?"" Not to mention that it is a somewhat autobiographical account of Sendaks own childhood...He IS Pierre! You will love it!"
5,Pierre by Maurice Sendak,"as an early education specialist, this is a wonderful treat to read and reread with children ages 2-7....the author and illustrator have the same effect of charm and warmth as they did when I was a child..makes a wonderful gift bringing lots of warm laughter to your home ...checkout his other books as well...simply marvelous!"
3,Aggressive and energetic music.,"This is the only disc that I've got from Accept. It's a fairly decent collection of hits. Their sound is like a mixture of Judas Priest and AC/DC. The singer (Udo Dirkschneider) has a lot of power behind his vocals. He sounds a bit like Brian Johnson from AC/DC. These guys play straight-ahead hardrock--their music is full of thick guitar riffs. Accept's musicianship is tight and skilled; their songwriting is not bad either. The songs that stand out are ""Too High to Get It Right,"" ""Princess of the Dawn,"" and ""Balls to the Wall."" The rest of the songs are okay. While I don't think that Accept is an original band, I still believe that they are respectable. They are aggressive and energetic in their approach. A satisfactory collection of songs."
2,"good for a first time accept listener, but that's it","as a true heavy metal and accept fan, i can tell you this compilation is unacceptable. the exclusion many solid and classic accept tracks, such as restless and wild, breaker, son of a bitch, im a rebel, love child, flash rockin man, midnight mover, neon nights etc. makes this a less than average sampling of accept's career. Accept are one of the greatest bands to come from the NWOBHM era of heavy metal, and this sampling of a mere ten songs does not do justice to what i consider the best German NWOBHM band. If you are listening to accept for the first time, i would suggest the album staying a life or balls to the wall. If you want an affordable cd that has a few of accept's greatest hits and some subpar accept songs, buy this."
3,Nice tables with scratches,These are nice tables but come with some finishing issues and small scratches. Also you have to put these together.
5,Saved the day when my Dremel died.,"This is a very-well-put-together kit. The grinder works as it should. I was cutting a stripped bolt off the back of an engine block with a Dremel, and a few minutes in the thing burned out. ARG! I got this thing out and kept going with no problems. Can't wait to get a larger-scale compressor so the cycle time doesn't get me."
2,Only good if you are incredibly out of shape!,"After my first two years in college, I wanted to lose some of the weight I had gained. This DVD was cheap and I needed to tighten up my arms so I bought it. All I can say is I did this about twice and now it's collecting dust. Like another reviewer said, it is boring and the instructor talks way too much. I'm really not used to working out a lot, especially my arms but I found this too easy and way too boring. They definitely could have cut out some of the talking and made it quicker. It would be good to do if you only have a couple minutes but the lengthiness of it due to unnessecary talking makes that impossible. For 35 minutes, I expect to get a more worthwhile workout."
2,Short workout...mostly fluff.,"This is one of the worst workout videos I have ever used. The women look scary, the music is dull and the instructor's comments are unnecessary. The first time I used it, the comments were ok, but he spends more time explaining what exercise we're about to do than he does actually leading the exercise. When I've used the DVD again, I put it on mute and play my own music. The up-side is that the moves are very simple. Other than that, I'd definitely pass this one up."
2,Not worth your time or your money.,"This dvd is boring and I found the host to be condescending. At most, this is a good starting point and is better than doing nothing at all. Perhaps doing this dvd will motivate you to find a better way to exercise. What I like the least about this video is that it does the least amount of workout on the underneath side of the arm; the part most women want to firm up. While I had the same idea as a previous reviewer in regards to pausing the dvd and doing 2 more rep's on my own, my second thought was 'why should I have to'? Why isn't this dvd made to be consistant, with 3 rep's for each segment. Poor editing, poor planning, and a really, really irritating host make this the least favorite workout dvd I've ever purchased. I would suggest spending your money on a dvd that is an all over body workout as you will get an even better workout for your body than this so called 'Sexy Arms' dvd can offer."
2,only if you've NEVER held weights before in your life,"If you're absolutely just starting out with weights, then maybe this is an okay tape for you -- it's got the most basic, time-honored, humdrum freeweight exercise routine that exists. But if you've ever touched a weight in your life, then you're going to be bored to death with this, and the guy's got no imagination. But if you've never heard of a bicep curl before, then maybe you'll be okay with this one. You'll want to turn the volume down after a couple of tries, though -- the chatter is inane, and he just keeps talking!"
3,It'll Do,"Not a bad arms workout, but the problem is the instructor only does 1 set of tricep exercises, so I have to rewind the DVD back to get at least 2 sets in. It wouldn't be that big of a deal if the DVD was better chaptered to have a chapter for each part of the arm."
4,Good work out.. very talky,It's hard to find a good arm workout on video/dvd and this is one of the best I've found. The guy talks entirely too much which is annoying but I fast forward over him between exercises. The set up is odd. He does 3 sets of shoulders 1 set of triceps and 2 sets of biceps. I only do 2 sets of shoulder and repeat the triceps to get 2 sets of those in too. The funniest part is that he has HUGE arms and he uses 5 pound weights. My arms are certainly tired afterwards and I am beginning to notice a difference.
2,Not so hot,"Exercises are effective, but moves too slowly for me. I can get in every bit as much in 1/2 the time w/ some of the other DVDS."
3,OK video -but not enough,"This video does have good classic toners but it does not seem like enough.It starts with 3 sets of 3 different shoulder/back excercisesthen moves on to one set of three different triceps-(which should have been three like the first set to make it more challenging) and last they hit the biceps and forarms. It moves pretty quickly but they tend to talk alot instead of just moving on with the excercises. I did not feel this dvd was challenging enough for me, it might even be to easy for a beginner. The video would have probably only been 15-20 minutes if they cut the talking in half (memorize and do on your own for a quicker workout), but the total running time is 35 minutes.I rate this 3 stars because it is OK but not enough time or sets in my opinion."
1,"insufficient, boring, and eventually annoying","I can do all the exercises here, with sufficient rests between them, plus a warm up and warm down, in 15 minutes. So what's the other 15 minutes of this 30 minute DVD? Um, the instructor blabbering on about nothing. The exercises are as basic as can be, you could do them without a DVD to follow because he doesn't switch things up at all to keep them interesting , and there isn't even any music to get into. This is the least useful exercise DVD I own -- I know that sounds really negative, but anything by Denise Austin or QuickFix would be a lot more interesting and a lot more creatively put together. You can find other DVDs with several different workouts on them so that you can rotate the routines, and for the same price. Keep looking and don't buy this one!"
2,Evil herbivores!!!,"This bundle is a MUST for any Izzard fan! I have been enjoying these on video for some time, and now I can enjoy them in better quality DVD. I absolutely LOVE his energy in ""Definite Article"" and ""Glorious"".It's great to look at these in the sequence of Eddie's career. One should not try to compare them to the widely known ""Dress to Kill"", because these were all done earlier. You have to think of them as passages in his life and comedy. Perhaps this is a sign that ""Live at The Ambassadors"" might eventually be on DVD as well.I cannot recommend these enough!!! Quickly, buy them now! Go on!"
4,Controls,"Overall, this is a great radio. Picks up many stations on AM and FM. Plenty of volume and clear sound from the small speaker. Shortwave reception also picks up several stations. Remember, this is an inexpensive little radio for the features. The main issue I have is the volume and tuning controls. There is too much play in the tuning control snd it is difficult to turn. The volume control seems to move several degrees with no sound and then in a short distance it really comes on strong. Stereo reception with quality headsets is very good."
1,repulsive,i thought i might get some insight but this is a disgraceful exhibition of male dominance and female submissiveness. it is certainly not the dogs knackers. tags
5,Historic indeed,The CD of this album issued in the '80s on the ``Great Performances'' label refers to this as a historic recording. I can see why. This is Stern at his absolute peak. I haven't heard another performance of either piece to match what he does here. The final movement of the Tchaikovsky will cause you to tie down loose objects near your speakers -- the gale is that strong.
5,Gentle yoga and easy to follow,"I used this video during my first pregnancy during the last 2 trimesters, and I really found it to be relaxing and I looked forward to doing it each day. I thought the stretches were gentle yet effective. I liked the relaxation techniques and the time spent connecting with your baby. This was really my first attempt at any kind of yoga, so I was afraid this would be too intense (I am not a very flexible person), but it was not at all difficult to catch on to and the stretches were not really difficult. I did notice that my flexbility significantly improved. There were some toning exercises involved as well, which I felt were the right difficulty level for a pregnant woman with a growing belly. I think that it also helped in my recovery time (although I had a c-section)."
3,Not the best Disney Christmas Album,"While this is not a great collection it isn't terrible either. There are better Disney collections out there.Track list:01. It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year (4 of 5)02. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (3 of 5)03. Jingle Bell Rock (3 of 5)04. Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree (4 of 5)05. White Christmas (2 of 5)06. Hey, Santa (2 of 5)07. My Gift to You (4 of 5)08. Little Saint Nick (4 of 5)09. Over the River and Through the Woods (3 of 5)10. The Laughing Song...(My three year old loves this song but it's not very Christmasy) (4 of 5)11. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas (4 of 5)12. Silent Night (4 of 5)Avg. Rating 3.1 of 5.0"
1,CDs poorly remastered,It would have been helpful in deciding to make this purchase to have known these were remastered old recordins from 78s or 331/2 RPM. The seller delivered quickly and there is no problem with that and it may be possible the seller was unaware that these were remastered poorly.
5,Awesome,It has helped me countless times figure out features I didn't readily understand - this little book does a great job! Well written - well designed.
2,What did I pay for this?,"I purchased this, as I thought it would be a great add-on to reading this wonderful book. My son fell in love with the cuddle soft mut. I wondered why in the heck did I bother when I could have purchased a much larger, better looking mut for the same price. This mut reminds me of a crane drop machine toy; (.50 would seem more like it). All in all, if you want a small / very scruffy / very soft stuffy for your child to hold while reading this book and don't mind spending the money; plus shipping, then get this add-on. Otherwise look elsewhere for better. The picture here does not look anything like what you get. Just my opinion, be warned."
5,Very Cute Plush Toy,"Wonderful plush toy that's very soft and resembles Winn Dixie from the movie. Fact is, I love it cause Winn Dixie looks a lot like my dog and I like to pretend the toy is of my dog (who likes it too and I might get another one just for my dog to play with!)."
2,I've seen better,Pros: They cover the seats.Cons: The tie down straps were weak and two have already broke. The cover didn't fit real well
4,good for the price,"not the highest quality. a couple of clips broke when installing it but you cant beat it for the price. fast shipping, very satisfied"
2,Whatever happened to HOT cinnamon candy?,"Valentines Day is one of those rare holidays where I join the Philistines whose favorite candy is not chocolate. Forget the heart shaped box, the chocolate chip roses, the cakes. Give me cinnamon that's hotter than a scorned woman's temper.Except, where did it go? Somewhere in the past few years, cinnamon candy got namby pamby. Someone told me that people complained.These are not the red hot Jelly Bellys I used to get. You know, the ones that made your nose run? And in a cold February, there's nothing better. (Well, nothing I'm going to talk about here, anyway) They're sanitized, expurgated, dare I say it? MILD, kiddie candy.Still looking for my sinfully hot cinnamon for the year. Any suggestions?Rebecca Kyle, February 2009"
4,Wow!,"I was exposed to this group by their incredible guitar work in the them song to FLCL. I didn't have as visceral and immediate a love for any one song on this album, but the guitar is outstanding."
4,Must have for The pillows fans,"I like this cd more than their recent efforts, namely ""penalty life"" and ""good dreams"".My favorite song in the whole cd has to be the 1st song ""my foot"".Other notable songs in the album are ""Third Eye"", ""Mighty Lovers"", and ""My Girl"".Definitely recommended for fans of the pillows."
4,casper8x@hotmail.com,This is a good cd if you like dark hardcore acid breaks. These guys can scratch down a break to spin you out of control! Something good to listen to when you're tired of melodic trance and you need something that will hit you like a hard acid wave!
5,Monroe is Solid Gold.,Monroe customer service is outstanding. Both my cars ride on Monroe struts. Monroe will go to bat for the customer and has your back. Strongly recommended. Buy with confidence.
4,Great Ride and control.,"I have a 2001 Ford Taurus with 102,000 miles on it. I bought all four Monroe struts. The ride and control are greatly improved its like having a new car."
4,AVIATOR DRIVER SUNGLASSES AMBER COPPER LENS,"I spent a long time scanning the site for Driving Sunglasses specifically for Amber Copper lens and at last I found this model. At first I was sceptical to place an order because of the low price as such it may not live up to its specifications. Since this Driver Sunglass is the type I was looking for, and after spending so much time scanning the site for a similar type which I could not find,I said to myself I have nothing to lose and placed the order. I received the Sunglasses within a week in good order - and that is very efficient service.On the first day I wore the Aviator Driver Sunglasses Amber Copper lens it really lived up to its specifications. It is pleasure wearing it because, not only it cuts out glare but reduces eye strain and the fit is perfect."
2,Dismal Attempt,"I purchased this DVD because my family is into high school wrestling. This movie presents the bully situation of youth and all the survival odds of loneliness, abandonment, low self esteem issues, etc... as many ""family movies"" do; however, it lacks any glue to hold and maintain your interest. I gave it to my wrestling grandsons who thought it was awful and could not finish watching it. I also tried to watch it but had to stop. It was just too boring and predictable with a theme that has been done to death. Perhaps it would be ok for a TV after school special movie for children."
1,this movie is lame & boring,this movie had nothing good in it and it rehashes other movies that have already been made this movie should never have gotten greenlighted or made this movie is a waste of time and money wwe films stink wwe stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,one of the lamest & most boring movie ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this movie stinks i really really really hate this movie its boring dull stupid and totally unintelligent this movie is one big epic fail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Movie did not do justice to storyline,"Story was good, but acting was fair and build-up needed more substance. Could have been a better highschool wrestling movie, if main character's progression from zero wrestling experience to real contender was fully developed. Frankly, had the movie - which was set in Oklahoma - actually been filmed there (home of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum), it would have been a big improvement. Unless you exercise no real standard for ""family"" viewing, take the PG-13 rating seriously."
3,Left wanting,"I was a bit disappointed with Legendary. After seeing the movie trailer I was really hyped up and excited to see an extremely well-written drama, with a refreshing spin on the age old tale of triumph over obstacles. It just sort of never rose to the occasion or my expectations. The acting talent was strong, and the movie touched on several important life values and issues. However, the material/script needed a little more umph! Also everything was just so dark and depressing. Altogether it was ok."
5,Great Movie,"This is a good family movie. It has some action, funny parts, drama, and realistic ending. It shows how a real wrestling pratice is run."
5,Legendary,I DID NOT BUY A DVD ON PURCHASE THE MOVIE ON AMAZON.COM TO WATCH ONLY ON THERE WEB SIT HAPPY NEW NEW YEAR IN 2012
3,Pretty good 80s compilation,"I'd rate this in the average to above-average category as far as compilations of 80s music go. There are some good songs here, but not enough new wave/modern rock/synth-pop (insert adjective here) for my personal taste.For example, although I like Belinda Carlisle's ""Heaven is a Place on Earth,"" I wouldn't pair it with some of these other songs and artists, once example being Men Without Hats. Speaking of them, I was disappointed to discover that the version of ""Safety Dance"" is the short version, which does not include the best part, where the ethereal woman's voice echoes out ""S-A-F-E-T-Y dance.""In summation, however, I do not regret buying this CD, because it has enough songs I like to make it worth the investment. (I was especially happy that they included ""Axel F"" by Harold Faltermeyer, because that is quite hard to find!)"
2,Kind of a let down when I opened it.,It fit but that's about all you can say. Thin metal and cheaply made in China.The hinges are much thinner than the originals and are loose.
1,Yet again the lies pour out,This book is another work by a guy whos never even met any true Hells Angels and still writes from what the rats that disgraced the club tell him. The book title itself sounds like a fairy tale. The book proclaims that how the Hells Angels are a real threat to society. I think the police are the ones that need to be watched and not the Hells Angels. Anytime I've had a conversation with one of the Hells Angels members. They are basically the most polite and honorable people you could meet. This book is a total disgrace to Hells Angels and motorcycle club members everywhere.
4,Finally the rumors are put to rest about certain LE MC's,"Finally the rumors are put to rest about the Wild Pigs LE MC in chapter 8 (1st edition, Hardbound, page 316-330), and the Blue Knights LE MC are even mentioned in it as well.I found the book to be a very good read and a must read for all LE MC members.Riley GInternational PresidentBlood Brothers MC"
4,Charlotte Gray,Cate Blanchett shines here but the story is a little slow at times. If you are a fan of Cate I would recommend it. Billy Crudup is great also.
3,A good insight into France with a strange ending,"The acting is excellent, and the use of English throughout is not really shocking.I would have rated this movie 5 stars as it portrays the French dilemma under the occupation with anguishing reality: betrayal, opportunism, collaboration,lack of humanity. A really depressing look at humanity, although rays of hope shine through in the personalities of the Charlotte and her Communist resistance hero.The ending, however, did me in....Her English pilot boyfriend, finally recovered alive, is briefly tossed aside in an unconvincing short scene, and Charlotte skips back to liberated France to live the rural dream with her resistance companion...shades of` Utopia under the Tuscan sun` or the young lady and the Continent. Not worthy of the rest of the movie."
2,Lengthy... Meandering Plot,"I wanted to like Charlotte Gray. I'm a big fan of war stories, but I found this film to be drawn out, and at times tedious. Charlotte is a Scotswoman, selected to become a spy in war-torn France. When her cover is almost blown, she is hidden away in a remote farm playing mommy to two orphan boys.While I enjoyed the cinematography, I didn't care for Charlotte's character. Her romance with the pilot seemed superficial to me. Her convictions to help France, had all the genuineness of a dogma spouting cultist. And, I'm sorry... But if I were selected to be a spy, I would hope I'd do more than play housekeeper. Come on Girl!I had to give up half way through the movie. I just couldn't muster the interest to finish it. Perhaps if the story had been a little tighter and the characters a little more engaging....? Overall, I was disappointed."
1,Really Bad ! Incoherent !,"What a bad movie ! I like Kate B but why is she playing in this...? First, she's selected as a spy to go to France because she's a french speaker and what a surprise to see that once in France, everybody speak english ! What a Joke ! ...I'm french and I didn't know that in France people were english speakers ;0/ I put the french language option through the DVD and it's not better...All the actors are english or american so it means that there is a french dubbing ...and this is very bad.Voices are ridiculous. Now about the story, there are so many incoherences in the story.It is in my oopinion the movie you need if you are tired after a long day.You will sleep quickly so much this stuff is long,boring.."
1,Mesmerizing Story,"I found this movie when flipping channels at home; and even though I did not see it from the beginning, I was hooked til the finish. The story was intriguing, but not to the point where I couldn't keep up and understand what was going on. The ending was not predictable in my opinion, which was good.Cate Blanchett was unbelievably beautiful and captivating all the way through the movie, and I think I would have enjoyed it whether I kept up with the story line or not.I recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys war stores, love stories and great acting."
4,Keeping it real!,I believe it will help young people to see that once they are out on their own some tough decisions have to be made.
2,I am disappointed,"I bought this book for my 70-67 exam which I was palnning to take on 01/12. After I finished the first 2 chapters I was so frustrated and thought that I would never pass or understand the NT server... It is a kind of a book that makes you read more hoping that you'll understand what you already read later on, until suddenly the chapter is over. To be fair, I think there is nothing wrong with the material, maybe its just the presentation that made me dislike this book."
3,Okay in combination with other books,"I found the book a bit wordy in places, and definitely unclear on some of the key concepts. I was very green at NT server 4.0, and this really didn't help. I would recommend getting this book in combination with Mark Minasi's Mastering Windows NT Server, and doing lots and lots of practice questions. As it was I barely scraped through the exam. Also the CD wasn't very good, I didn't use it at all. But if you read widely, and aren't scared to read some chapters twice or three times it can be useful."
1,Junk Charger for NP-FH50,"This charger is JUNK, as far as use with an NP-FH50 battery. I received the item and a new retail-packaged Sony NP-FH50 for my new DSC-H100V with the intent to use this charger to keep the extra battery topped-up for picture taking. As soon as they arrived I upackaged them both, reviewed the directions, and plugged the charger in then plugged in the battery. An hour and twenty minutes later the light went green so I disconnected and put the battery in my new camera and it was only about 50% charged!This charger was originally packaged for use with the NP-FP50 (an older style battery) and had a stick-on label added to the packaging indicating that it was also for use with the FH style battery. I beleive you will be a lot happier with the genuine Sony BC-TRV charger (also available on Amazon.com) for the newer FH style batteries, I know I ordered one!"
1,an embarrasment to metal.....................YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bay area thrasher is right.Its stuff that ruins the greatness of metal which try to bring it back to the days of mullets and leather jackets.the music itself sucks the singer sound emo and all they talk bout is ""BLAH BLAH BLAH metal IS GOD BLAH BLAH BLAH WarRiORs Of TeH mEtUL"" For lyrics That are about REAL lfe get megadeths rust in peace."
2,Nostalgia and corniness in a blender,"If you're a fan of 80's metal, but also love the cheesy sounds of modern power metal, you will LOVE Dream Evil. It's sort of the same way 80's hair bands liked to sing about how they rock. Only this band sings about how they love metal and headbanging. Rob Halford would be proud of this band's choice in clothing. It's decent if you're really drunk or are just messing around, but if you take it seriously, I can only wonder if you have many friends.If you're going to go down the corny path but want to remain with something that kicks ass, pick up the Dio album 'Dream Evil' instead."
2,Grilled Cheese anyone?,"Well only having five reviews including mine show why this kind of warrior metal has some of the worst lyrics you could possibly want.Also the Dream Evil cliche,gee wasnt that Dio's album hmmm,the first song i heard from this band was Fight by My Side which has a very good riff,also some of the songs on here have good riffs as well.But where this band goes HORRIBLY wrong is lyrics.I get nauseated everytime i hear another song about fighting for METAL,we are METAL,METAL is the way of life blah blah.The last album had the worst line ever in a song,I am made of metal so is my WIFE,then she exclaims I AM HIS WIFE,then there is a faint SHUT UP,afterwards umm ok,if i made my wife do that she would divorce me for sure.But anyways bands like this should not take themselves seriously and hopefully they don't.Because i know i love metal and i don't have to tell everyone how much and make corny,abnoxious songs about it.Later"
3,Massive CHEESE,This album is well produced. The bonus dvd is really a waste. I don't get swedish humor. Every song is a rip off of somebody else. There is no originality at all. The lyrics are so bad its not even funny. This album is like a bad parody of a Scorpions record. If you want something new and different wrong album. If you want that old school power metal and didn't get into it the first time around then maybe this album will be new and exciting for you.
3,Just read my review...,"OK, Dream Evil are a straight up wannabe metal band, and I can't hide that. I also can't hide that I really liked this CD anyways. Sure, the lyrics are kind of (or, really) shallow at times (sometimes too much), but hey, you gotta love the catchy riffs of Gus G., with really annoying 80's vocals. Not really that bad, either."
5,Fantastic,"I have two of these, a 6 bottle and a 4 bottle, and they are fantastic. Easy to set up, easy to clean, and while there is a little bit of skill to using them - once you have it down that's easy too!The *only* downside that I ran into is that it can only handle tall skinny bottles - so things like Patron have to be decanted."
5,MARVELOUS,"IAM PLEASE TO SAY THAT IRECD MY BAR BUTLER IN NO TIME AT ALL ,AM PLEASE WITH THE PRODUCT AND IT IS THE HIGH LIGHT OF ALL MY PARTIES. MY GUEST JUST LOVE THEM. AND THEY LOOK VERY INVITING SITTING ON MY BACKYARD BAR. IAM VERY PLEASE WITH THIS PRODUCT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A STRAIN"
2,Breaks Easily,"Cute idea, but when I received it, three of the dispensers were already broken off. I think it may be a bit fragile. Still waiting on the replacement dispensers the seller promised (seller was Unique Gifts)."
1,WOW...,"I find it hard to believe that a band could really be this bad... Their songs are bland and uninspired, the drummer has no talent whatsoever, and the vocalist has the voice of a 15 year-old BOY in a sub-par highschool choir.Don't waste your money on this."
5,Stimulating,This is a fantastic book that sums up much modern work in the search for Noah's ark and the many eye witness tales from the past from people who claim to have seen it first hand. Violet Cummings wrote about her and her husband's years of research and their visits to the mountains of Ararat.
1,"It's dead, Jim.","Regardless of the possible historical significance of this book, the fact remains that Apple officially pulled the plug on E-World as of 3/31/97. One should consider whether reading this book would be an appropriate use of one's time"
1,An amateur,"The book was written by a rank amateur. If it were not for his name, no publisher would have touched it. Either stick to acting,Gene,which you do exceedingly well, or serve an apprenticeship, as other writers must do."
2,The Lightning Never Strikes,"Can you recall the scene in ""Frankenstein"" when they raise the dead body up to the heavens so that the lightning will strike it and bring it to life? Well, that is very like this book where all the pieces are in place, everything seems okay, but the lightning never strikes! It never comes to life; you can never quite believe it. Good writers lend a kind of grace to their work and you are drawn in, seduced, involved, and you ""live along with it."" These authors are workmanlike, but without that grace. If I knew how to do it, I'd be writing. But I know it when I see it and this isn't it. Nothing wrong with this plot or these characters that Louis L'Amour couldn't fix. But these authors either didn't and probably can't. Still - this is a first book; maybe they'll improve."
5,"Deeper than ""20,000 Leagues""/More Bite than ""Jaws""",Jack's character building was magnificent. I close my eyes and smell the sea. It's remarkable to me that this is Hackman and Lenihan's first effort. Can't wait for their next.
5,Most enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book cover to cover. The characters engaged me from the beginning, and I was never quite sure what the next plot turn would be. The ending was unexpected and quite satisfying. As a woman who reads novels of the purportedly more ""literary"" genre, I was pleasantly surprised by the ""pirate adventure story,"" which went deeper under the skin than most commercial fiction. Loved the diving sequences!"
2,Lori,"A fine old-time adventure on the seas with relatively well-built characters and an interesting story line.However, the writing style itself was a bit juvenile and a little too pat...a frequent flaw of new writers who have to make their characters do what the writers intend, not what is in the character's nature to do. Usually it is only mildly noticeable in this book, but a couple of times it was straight-out winceable.If not too critical about style then this book should prove to be a great good time."
5,Entertaining Reading,"I throughly enjoyed the Wake of the Perdido Star. Jake, Paul, Quince and company force to keep turning pages to see what they will do next. A very good book with interesting views of what the seas were like when pirates roamed free and effects of breathing compressed air was still a mystery."
4,Suprising Book,"The ""Wake of the Perdido Star"" really surprised me. The book was much better than I expected. The story accelerates from the beginning and doesn't slow down until the last page. The characters are likeable, the plot is exciting and intense, and the story is an adventure, taking the characters all around the globe. I had a hard time putting this book down once I started reading it. This book was truly a pleasant surprise."
5,Simply outstanding,If you are into Operations Research / Management Science modeling - this is a must. The most up-to-date and comprehensive source of the supply-chain theory.
3,Heavy Reading,This is very serious reading material and was not able to read all of it. It is however useful for those who are working in the industry.
5,Just what I needed,This product is heavy duty and I love it. I kept buying the wooden ones and they would break. I finally found this and it is great!
5,A welcome newcomer to the Soul scene,"Like others, I first learned of Marlon Saunders through two of the Jazzhole recordings.Now, I don't consider myself a true R&B fan although there's much I like in the genre. I'm more of a fan of world music. However, this debut album has energy as well as soul. He seems less restrained here than he was on the two recordings I have of his with Jazzhole. In fact, there's a bit of a roughness here, a bit more of baring himself rather than abiding to a group's standard.As such, I highly recommend it. Have the joy of having discovered this talent while he's still being discovered. Listen and enjoy."
4,Sophisticated Soul,"Saunders is best known as a founding member of the acid jazz combo Jazzhole. Though his songwriting is featured prominently in the group context, his vocals typically only adorn a few tracks. On this first solo album his singing is pushed to the fore to match his songwriting contributions. The result is surprisingly old-school, given that fellow Jazzhole founder Warren Rosenstein produced over half the album's tracks (Shawn V. Lucas filled the chair for the rest). The backings are sophisticated, but smooth and melow, without the aural explorations or jamming passages of Jazzhole. This keeps the focus on Saunders and his lyrics - right where it should be for a solo album. A fine record for playing with the lights low.\"
4,Real Good Set,"dig this Set&First thing that came to Mind was that this Cat was a Cross Between Philip Bailey Meets Peabo Bryson.matter of fact this might be the Best Solo Album that Philip Bailey never met.the only thing i wasn't feeling was his Version of ""Stevie Wonder's ""If it's magic"".I think He should have done Earth,wind&Fire's ""I'll Write a Song"".but this Album was Good from start to finish to me."
3,"Good soul music with jazz tones, but the draw doesn't catch","As part of the group Jazzhole, Marlon Saunders has shown he has the chops to write good songs and this album keeps that charge's momentum intact. The problem with some of the Jazzhole material, however, was that whenever someone - usually Marlon - would take to the microphone, they revelad chinks in their armor. You always thought that the songs would be great if someone else were singing them. Putting Marlon front and center on this project makes this dynamic all the more apparent. He's a fine songwriter and knows his way around a production studio, but the vocals sound forced and not up to par with the ability of the songwriting to capture the moods they're reaching for. More times than not, the ambience set by the beginning of a solid track was shattered when Marlon came in. Unfortunate."
1,Would be nice if it worked.,"My husband got me this watch for my birthday because I collect owls. We were both so happy about it, until I realized that it only works intermittently. The back does not snap on tight enough to hold the battery where it should always be. What a disappointment. What's the use of wearing a watch that doesn't always tell time?"
1,"Look for another collection, please...","This collection is realy bad. The sound quality is the worst aspect: all of it has ""an air back noise"" (try to record anything with your old micro-taped answer-machine: it will be the same as these effects). There are certanly other collections better then this one, that is old fashioned. And it doesn't have 400 diferent sounds: at least 150 are repetitions with the same title, without mention those with a diferent title and the same ""effect"". Save your money and look for something new!"
3,Not Bad for Such a price.,"This set includes 400 sound effects for 14 dollars. Dont expect Hollywood style high end effects. But there are very good useful effects. It contains things like rain, car, birds , winds, clocks etc. Sound quality is pretty low on some tracks. But anyway It seems ideal for short filmmakers, videomakers."
2,Pretty bad,"Like most sound effects CDs marketed to the general public, this one is of fairly low quality. The sounds are generally inconsistent, poorly recorded, and not very useful. It's fairly obvious that they were compiled from various other sources, rather than being recorded specifically for this release.If you need sound effects for an extremely amateur film, and you have absolutely no budget, this CD might be useful. I can't recommend it for anything other than that, though. You can download samples of comparable quality for free, or create much better recordings with a good microphone, free software, and a modicum of technical knowledge."
4,Great item for teachers,"This collection offers teachers the opportunity to enhance stories with sounds. While there are some sounds that have different versions (ie. police car 1,, 2,and 3), there is still plenty of variety of sounds. As pointed out by other reviewers, the sound quality is not always the greatest. Although I agree that the sound quality could be better, this is an excellent resource for the price. I have had many opportunities to utilize these sounds and have never gotten a bad review from any of my classes. My four star rating is based on the number of sounds available and its usefulness as a teaching tool."
1,Worst Struts...Loud and clanky!!!,Do not buy these struts...cheap knock offs and make a lot of noise...worse than what I had on my 2001 Avalon. Had to have them replaced within 3 months and could not return them or get a refund from Amazon...stay away!!! Last time I buy any auto parts from Amazon or Ebay...go to your local auto parts store...at least they stand behind their product. It is not worth your time or money to buy from here.
4,Quick Strut experience,"Delivery was quick and the parts were correct and undamaged. Installing the struts in my 2000 Camry was pretty easy. My son took care of removing the back seat for access to the top mounting bolts of the rear struts. Used four jack-stands so everything was accessible. Ruined one front strut lower mounting nut while removing the old strut and had to replace it with one from Toyota. The ride is quite a bit firmer than the old units, especially over small bumps."
2,Poor quality control.,"This was one of four quickstruts ordered at the same time. The other three of the set were fine, and were installed and perfromed as expected. This one part number was installed and produced a loud metallic clunk even on relatively smooth streets. It was removed and returned for credit at no shipping cost to me. The account was credited shortly thereafter. A replacement quickstrut of the same make and part number was acquired at a local auto parts store.This is an example of the kind of situation that can happen when ordering discount priced auto parts from the web. Perhaps the products cost less for a quality control reason. However, due to cost savings, I expect to continue to acquire certain auto parts on the web."
2,Poor ending to good series,"Suze annoys me so much this book. I feel like it could be a good 100 pages shorter and better if they would take out all the whining she does about how if Paul saves Jesse then they will never meet, seriously over and over. Ok we GET IT! She even goes on to say how he is the only thing she has in her life that makes it worth living at some point. That's really great that your family and friends you don't care at all about, just your boyfriend, am I reading the other Twilight here? She spends enough time talking about the way Jesse looks to make me think I am. The ending was unbelievably lucky and felt like a cop out. I feel like there's some many other ways Meg Cabot could have finished it that would have been better. I'd stick with reading one of the other Mediator books."
5,this is my favorite book ever!!,"I reccomend that you read the rest of the series first, but they are all really good. Twilight is about Suze who is a mediator, someone who can see and speak to ghosts. In this book she is in love with Jesse, the ghost who lives in her bedroom but since nobody can see him and he is dead, they cant really go out. But thats not the real problem; Paul, a fellow mediator, knows a way to travel through time and save Jesse, which would mean he would never have died and would never have lived in Suzes room for over 100 years and Suze would never have met him. Suze doesnt know what to do because she doesnt want to keep him from ever living a normal life, but if she lets him, then she will live her life, never having met him. Once Suze comes to a decision, she encounters more road blocks and starts having second thoughts. To find out what Suze decides and what happens to her and Jesse, read this book and the others in the series."
5,Mediator Must Read,"I read this book 3 times! Its amazing. Mediator(person who can talk+touch ghosts), Suze Simon is in love with 19th century ghost, hottie, Jesse. But fellow mediator, Paul Slater, is threatening to keep Jesse away from her by stopping Jesse from dying. Suze has to figure out weather to let the person she loves most live or have him die to be with her. Don't worry I'm not telling you anything that you wouldn't on the book jacket. This book has much bigger twists than you would think. I LOVE THIS BOOK! 5 STARS!"
5,"Twilight (The Mediator, Book 6)",This book was a Christmas present for my daughter. She really enjoyed reading this book in the series so we will be searching for more books from this author.
5,the mediator 6,I love the mediator books so much and I want them to go to book seven maybe even ten. I've gotten addicted to them and I don't want them to end at 6.
2,just okay,"Bought this for my 4 year old daughter and like always, I screened it before I gave it to her. The poems are cute and easy to read and understand, but won't be for everybody. First, there was a lot about going to Grandma's for the big, big family dinner. We don't have a big, big family, so this always confuses my daughter a little bit. Next there was mom in the kitchen cooking...well, Dad usually cooks at our house. Oh, and the poem about the turkey that became dinner. I'm not super picky with my daughter's books and like to expose her to a lot of stuff, but this book of poems just didn't sit well with me so I never even gave it to her. I might read it again next year and see if it seems more appropriate."
3,A Pleasant Surprise,"I received this book in error, but it was a pleasant relief to read about a true-life story. The author fell in love with a man who had a past. A past prison term. He didn't know which was worst -- being locked up inside prison walls, or being locked up inside himself. Prison was hell but so was the prison of his release. We need more authors to write reality books. Something that can help another brother or sister along the way."
5,Great Read,"This book really showed a piece of reality.Tower's plight is one many African-American men deal with. When I get free should be read by all African-American youth and young adults alike. It gives insight into family function and dysfunction. This book demonstrates the results that people get in life based on the decisions they make on one end, and the influences that the environment can have on youth formulating their philosophy of life, morals and values on another end.Great Read!!!!"
2,Hard to get into,"I had a difficult time getting into this book. I agree with the other reviewer that the main character was the only one that was extensively developed. The others were shallow. You really didn't get to know them. I've read other books (and there are several) on prison time and what it's like on the inside and how some of them coped with life when they were free, and I was able to get a grip on those reads, but this one...it wasn't expressly written."
3,Good Reading,"First I want to say thank you to the authour for letting me know about her work. As far as the book goes, it was interesting, yet I felt that the main character was the only one that got a very deep description. The other characters were kinda vauge and I couldn't get a visual on who they were and how they really affected Tower. However, I did like the book and have told others to pick up a copy."
3,Great until it broke!,"This thermometer was great until it quit working. I had it for about 3 months when the outdoor temp started showing up only off and on. Now, I can not get an outdoor temp to show at all. I tried all the obvious stuff like changing batteries, closer location to the base etc...nothing. I don't know if this is a common problem or if I am just unlucky. I called Taylor and got a real person on the phone right away. Wish me luck getting an exchange."
4,"Good, until batteries got weak after two years.","In 2005, I bought two Taylor #1468s, each with a 1468 remote. After two years, both 1468s stopped receiving from one remote sensor. I replaced batteries in the remote. Its xmit light still flashes every 2m30s but the 1468s base stations do not show the remote reading. Finally found the *tiny* low battery indicators in the displays on the 1468s -- both 1468s needed new batteries. That fixed the problem. --JohnH"
5,Dermaplaning at home!,"For a fraction of the cost you can give yourself the ultimate facial topper! Remove facial hair and the top layer of dead skin and reveal the soft smooth fresh new skin below. This is the perfect ""do it yourself"" exfoliant.........and it doesn't cost $$$."
5,Gabriella Razors where have you been all my Life!,"These razors are worth every penny! They pick up fine and course hair, doesn't cut the skin and leaves skin smooth. Hope Amazon keeps these razors on their site. Glad to get rid of my wax creams that don't work as well as these wondderful razors."
1,Disappointing to say the least.,"I bought this book on the strength of the positive reviews here but found I couldn't read it. The writing is amateurish, the characters trite, and the plot contrived. I've been stung by reviews before but never this badly. From now on I won't buy fish without smelling it first, which means I'll be less trusting of the opinions I read here."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be . . . .,"After reading the other reviews, I was ready to sit down for a good read and I was dissapointed! I found the characters shallow and boring, no thrills or rollercoaster rides. This book was just alright for me and I would not recommend it to anyone. I bought another Ken Scott book and I hope it is better than this one."
2,I still cannot get over my disappointment in the ending,"The book was typical of Sparks' style, and I was fortunate to listen to it on tape. The descriptions of love and bliss made me grin unconsciously and I thought about it often. Until earlier today. I couldn't finish the final disc after it became known of the horrible ending Sparks left us with. The other problems the couple dealt with was enough for one book, the ending was not necessary. Granted I could not finish it...but I would have much preferred something less dismal for the ending. I'm going to pretend the two lived a happy life with Claire and Jeremy got the life he clearly deserved."
3,"Story of life, love and loss","Once again Nicholas Sparks has written a novel that flows and seems so natural. The plot is well thought out, his dialog is believable and you can actually see the story-taking place.He is able to take you on the roller coaster ride of life with this small book. You will experience joy, laughter, sadness, frustration, hope and love. This story follows the relationship of a couple and how they learn who each other really are.I did not seek this book out it was given to me. And I was surprised to find that I read the entire book in one evening. The book is well written and easy to read. And though I gave it only three stars, the fine woman who gave me the book to read would have given him a five."
5,Tear Jerker,"After reading True Believer, I could not wait to see what happend with Jeremy and Lexie. As I read At First Sight, I felt as if I knew each character, and was going through each experience with him/her. Nicholas Sparks has a way of drawing you in, and he couldn't have done it any better with At First Sight. This book has so many ups and downs, and really makes the reader believe in true love and soul mates. By the end of the story, I was sobbing and could not stop for at least an hour! Nicholas Sparks throws in an unexpected ending that will leave you in shock..."
3,good read,"I did not realize this book was a sequel when I purchased it. I bought it while on vacation. I thought most of the book was rather slow moving and not really attention grabbing. I am not sure if this is because it was a sequal, and the characters were more fully developed and described in the preceding book, which I did not read. I thought the book was going to be very precitable, but the ending really shocked me. I should have seen it coming, having read other Sparks books, and the endings usually are really good.For a book that I had a hard time picking up at first, I have to say that by the end I had a hard time putting it down."
1,A terrible book,"At First Sight tells the story of divorced writer Jeremy Marsh and his marriage to smalltown librarian Lexie Darnell. It follows the couple from Jeremy's move from New York City to tiny, southern Boone Creek, North Carolina. It follows their wedding plans, their house purchase, her pregnancy.And if that isn't enough, it throws in some paranormal events, a nosy old small-time mayor and a tear-jerking ending that feels manipulative and unoriginal.There is room on my bookshelves for simple, sweet books. But the writing has to be honest, and it has to soar, for the simplicity to work. The writing in At First Sight seemed strained. Conversations between Lexie and Jeremy made them both seem unlikeable at best and cliched at worst.When I see such rave reviews, and realize that Sparks is a bestselling writer, I think too many readers are selling themselves short."
3,Ending is too sad.,"I love to read fiction because, unlike real life, there can always be a happy ending. I was so into this book. I loved True Believer and couldn't wait to get At First Sight. True Believer ended spectacular, and in my opinion, Mr. Sparks should have closed the story there and left the good feeling remain. If I had known how At First Sight ended, I would not have wasted my time reading it. I like to smile at the close of a story, not go thru a box of kleenex because of the tears. Mr. Sparks is a wonderful writer, but I don't think I'll take a chance on any more of his books. Like I said above, I read fiction for a reprieve from the sadness of life. Keep some happiness in the make-believe world, please, Mr. Sparks."
5,love story,"awesome book.. at first sight picks up a little after true believer ended... you see jeremy and lexie's relationship blossom and grow.. i cant really say too much without giving away the ending to both books.. but it is an awesome love story that really makes you think about love, life, and how to deal with situations that are totally unexpected."
3,At First Sight,I did not think this was one of Sparks best books. The characters were hard to connect with. I had figured out what was going to happen in the book very early on. This was just an okay read for me.
3,Decent follow-up,"Considering this is Nicholas Sparks' first two-part story, I was worried and intrigued to see how it went. Overall, it was fine. Seems another typical Nicholas Sparks. He did do a good job of following up on the story-line from 'True Believer' though."
3,Just OK!!!,"The first chapters grabbed my attention; I couldn't put the book down! Mid-chapters was ok I kept reading to see where the story was going!!! Well I could tell you this I was not expecting that ending, I think he should have been more creative! It was an unexpected ending, but not exciting! Out of 5 stars 3 is stars is more than fair!!!"
4,If it weren't for that sad ending...,"I prefer happy endings, and Sparks continually writes unhappy endings. So, you would think that I would have quit reading his books by now. But the fact remains; I love his stories.The main character, Jeremy, has been through one too many tough times, what with his divorce and all. Then he meets Lexie, and for a while, life is good, really good. Without giving away too much, let's just say that it doesn't last. In the end, he supposedly learns life's most important lessons as the reader goes through a box of tissues. Really, don't read this in public. You'll be blubbering all over the place.FYI, men will probably get grossed out when reading this book since it goes into a lot of feminine detail about pregnancy and baby birthing."
2,A Romance Novel that Never Was,"First book I read by Sparks was The Notebook it was pretty good. I figured since I liked his style of writing I would enjoy his other books. Well it looks like that he is writing for someone from Hollywood to buy the rights for his books. At First Sight is a sequel to the True Believer. First Sight is full of repetitions like Sparks highlighted sentences from the Believer, and pasted it in Sight's when he was writing it. This book wants to be a romance novel but even for a tearjerker it's pretty weak. Both books are trying to hard to prove how great it is to live in an area where you could die of boredom and where everyone knows your business. I can understand when someone falls in love and willing to move where their new found loved one lives, but common this could be done without the syrup dripping sentiments."
3,sparks has done better,story dragged too much..........predictable like the weather when is just about to rain:-(
3,Okay but Not Near His Best,"This book is a romance between Jeremy, a successful New Yorkmagazine columnist, who falls in love with Lexie, a country girl, and moves to her neck of the woods away from the city. The author delves into the dynamics of friendship, commitment, marriage, pregnancy and fatherhood. It gave insights into the adjustments involved in entering and maintaining a serious relationship by centering on Jeremy's and Lexie's feelings as their relationship progressed. The ending surprised me so I'd say it is a good book and recommend it to anyone who likes romance."
3,So hard to get going,"I have been a fan of Sparks' book (even though my another favortie author, Jodi Picoult, couldn't stand him at all) and read all of his books.But I have tell you. The first 100 pages of this book is some of his worst writing. It does get better but the start was pretty bad. I am wondering why he even needs two separate books (True Believer, At First Sight) even though he expalined why he did so in his website.By the way he did redeem himself with his next book, Dear John."
1,He's slowly withering away!,"Nicholas Sparks is, like I said, slowly withering away. As many others reviewing have said, this man will write anything just so people know he's still out there. I would much rather read something from an author who writes one book every so often that is good, then many short books every year just so we know they're still writing.The writing was horrible and I think my cat could have done better. Also, there were no surprises-I basically always knew what was going to happen next. Sparks is too predictable. Plus, after Jeremy recieves the first e-mail, you know who it is, it's very obvious.The only good book Sparks wrote was 'The Guardian', although even that is losing its touch now that I've read his crappier books."
2,Didn't like how it ended,"I was not at all happy with the way this book ended. This is the first book by Sparks that I read. I have other books by this author, but if he ends all of his books in this manner, I am not sure I want to read the others that I do have!!"
2,Silly and unrealistic,"I haven't read many books written by Patterson but I liked The Notebook so I thought I would read some of his other publications. I didn't find much to like about At First Sight.The story is totally unbelievable and the characters one-dimensional. It is a boiler plate romance novel. The couple are immediately attracted to each other but something keeps them apart. A wave of a wand and they both know they love each other. The happy couple then find and overcome adversity.Patterson is not a bad writer. If you are looking to escape from the daily grind and want to find romance in an easy read, you won't be disappointed. If you want a realistic story and believeable characters, then At First Sight isn't for you."
1,Give Nobel to Danielle Steel!!!!!!,"And I thought Steel was terrible! I was certainly being unjust to her because Sparks makes her a Literary Dame...I was quite sure about his writing from the tear jerking oriented, sappy and trite book names, but when my sister gave and begged me to read the book, I just made the mistake of giving a try..Now my sister deserves a good spank...probably on the head hoping that she will get more wiser next time... The prose (assuming there WAS a prose) is stilted, dialogues are hackneyed and every word felt as if written by a 5th grade pupil. But I am sure even a 5th grade pupil can pull out a better character for Doris, that boring caricature. If this is what our people is currently dying to read, then I may start writing a book which I am sure will sell millions with a little bit of sappiness and a sound marketing ploy.Drop Sparks from publishing world and save millions of poor trees! Y'know you can do it!"
4,A Rollercoaster of Emotions,"At First Sight is about endings that bring new beginnings...tragedies that lead to unexpected joy...and, most of all, the magic of everlasting love.Author Nicholas Sparks draws his readers with the skill of a heart surgeon through a maze of emotions: love, confusion, fear, betrayal, anger, sorrow and back to love. Tears of both laughter and heartbreak make a box of tissues a necessary accoutrement while reading At First Sight."
2,I'm Disappointed in This One,"I LOVE Nicholas Sparks and buy his books right when they hit the shelves, but this one just did nothing for me. I just kept reading it it to see if it got any better,it didn't. I was disappointed all through it and thought the ending would make up for the rest of the story but not so, I was very disappointed with the ending also.I hope the next one is better!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,I love most of his books but I found this one to be a letdown. The plot is very slow and it ends on a depressing note. I'm still not sure why it had to be that way since it added very little to the story.
3,Great...until the end,"This book was disappointing.....maybe it is just me liking happy endings....but I felt betrayed in the last two chapters of the book and after becomming attached to Lexie in ""True Believer"" I was stunned by the ending of ""At First Sight."" If you like happy endings...and have read ""True Believer"" write your own happy ending for Jeremy and Lexie....and skip out on ""At First Sight."" ...Though in all fairness I must say I liked the book until the ending."
2,NOT MY FAVORITE,"I have read all of Nicolas Sparks books & this is by FAR my least favorite. I wasn't drawn in my the characters; if anything I was drawn AWAY from them. Very tragic ending.If you want to read the perfect book, go read The Notebook. I guarantee you will love that one!"
2,Rather disappointing for Sparks,"2 of 2 people found the following review helpful:I have read & enjoyed most of Sparks previous books, often looking specifically for his new books to come out. I found this book to be slow and lacking whatever it takes to hold ones attention. I did not enjoy the book as I had not enjoyed 3 weeks with my brother."
2,From a Sparks fan...,"Sad to say, I didn't enjoy this one. I have read and really enjoyed his previous work, and I am always excited to see a new one come out, but this one just didn't hold my attention."
2,I love Sparks but this was my least favorite. Do not read if you are pregnant!,Not his best work. I have read everything by Sparks and was so excited to get my hand on this. I usually read a Sparks book in a matter of hours to two days max. This took me over a week. The first 100-175 pages was like watching paint dry. After that it did get significantly more intersting. Do not read if you are expecting it will just add addtional things for you to worry about!
2,Dissapointing for Sparks,"I have read every Nicholas Sparks book out, and this was my least favorite. I was very dissapointed in this one. It was very slow getting into, and was extremely depressing. I'm all for a good cry from a book, but this one was beyond that. You wouldn't miss anything if you chose to skip this one! Sorry Mr. Sparks!"
1,1st Sparks book I ever read,"After reading the other reviews, I wish I had read True Believer first, maybe it would have made this book more enjoyable. This was the first Sparks book that I have read and was pretty disappointed. I really felt like nothing happened throughout the whole book until the last chapter. The storylines that could have made the book more eventful were very briefly described, followed by chapters of a whole lotta nothing. (Alvin, Rodney/Lexi, Rachel) I just wasn't impressed."
1,Disappointed with this one,"Like many have previously said, this book was a let down. I STRUGGLED to get through it and really did get the impression it was something he had to get to the publisher fast. If you're deciding between this and another Sparks book, go with the other one. For the first time, I found myself anxious to put one oh his books down and essentially forced myself to finish. Mr. Sparks, please go back to developing those endearing charachters, because that's what I love about your work."
3,It is what it is!,Nicholas Sparks is a great read if you love sappy stories with a twist. This is no different. I probably won't buy any more for my kindle at full price. I will just wait for the made of tv movie.
2,Boring!,"Boring, boring, boring and boring. Chewing pale emotions and useless thoughts throughout the book. After 150 pages I honestly gave up. Something happened in the characters' life before this book, and now it's only about thinking how it would be to become a parent and what would be if this didn't happen.Disappointed!"
2,Disappointed,I work in a library and my co-workers and patrons seem to love everything Nicholas Sparks writes. However from reading True Believer and At First Sight I can't figure out what Nicholas Sparks could possibly have to offer me. Should I give his other books a chance or will it just be more of the same?
4,good book,this book starts off a lil slow but ends with a great ending. you have your mind on the story of the wedding and child and dont expect the ending the way it is.
2,Least favorite Sparks book,Not a fan of this. I really enjoyed True Believer and thought this was would a great extension of that story. Not so..characters became less and less like-able as the story went on and it was difficult to feel part of their connection and great love story.
3,Teary eyed romantic novel!!,"At First Sight by Nicholas Sparks is one of the most romantic novels you could read. This book is a little hard to comprehend for the young teenagers. I wondered if this story was based on a true thing that happened to him. This story is a great book to read also because the main characters, Lexi and Jeremy, deal with daily couple problems. Jeremy moves away from his family for lexi and the unborn child but then Jeremy gets a very peculiar email with the title of Are you sure the baby is yours? Weird if you want to know more about if it is and the move was worth it then read the amazing novel of Nicholas Sparks!"
2,Readable but not worth the money...,"This book was on the bestseller's shelf at my local bookstore. I asked an employee about how books were selected for that shelf and was told that selection is based on a number of factors including positive customer reviews. Shocking. As a number of other customer's have commented on this site, this book was not worth the money it cost. It was silly, contrived and unrealistic.The cover of the book states that the writer is one of the best romance writers of all time. I typically don't read romance novels but I can't begin to imagine that that's possible."
3,Great Book!,"I give this book a 3, and yes it is a tear-jerker. Loved the characters, however there are a few story flaws in this book that are obvious.The character Lexie in the first book ""True Believer"", Sparks tells us that she is old-fashioned to a point that she doesn't believe in cell phones, and will never have one. In the first few chapters of the second book ""At First Sight"",which I read back to back, suddenly she is getting calls on her cell phone? I thought Sparks stated she didn't believe in them? I'm surprised the editors/Sparks never kept consistency!Also, in the first book ""True Believer"", it is stated that the mayor of Boone Creek has a crush on Lexie and has ""flirted"" with her often which leads us to believe he is single. However in the second book ""At First Sight"" the mayor suddenly has a wife of many years named Gladys (I think that's what her name was)?I found a few other story loopholes, but those are the two biggest ones. Other than that, it's worth reading! Get the kleenex!"
3,If you're pregnant...,"you may want to wait to read this book. While I enjoyed this book in much the same way I have enjoyed all of Nicholas Sparks' other books, with a large box of Kleenex handy, I wish I had waited to read this story. Being pregnant, the story line hits a little too close to home."
3,"All about love, marriage, betrayal, and tragedy-C+","This wasn't my favorite of Sparks, but as I went along in the book, it became more interesting.Jeremy, the main character of the book, met Lexie, and it was love at first sight. They wanted to get married without really knowing each other first, as she was pregnant with Jeremy's child. So Jeremy, a writer, picked up his stakes in New York to move near Lex's family in South Carolina.Life began there, but not without a lot of hardships and betrayal on Lex's part. Jeremy kept receiving strange e-mails that tried to tell him the baby wasn't his, and that it was someone else's child. So the relationship began to fall apart.The two get back together again though, and try to pick up the pieces. They live a happy life as a married couple finally, when tragedy strikes in a terrible way."
4,Good book but a sad ending....,"I love Nicholas Sparks books. It is great to see what happens to the characters from True Believer. However, be prepared for a sad ending, much like A Walk to Remember. I am used to his books that have happy endings and this was somewhat of a shock. It is worth the read though."
4,One of Sparks' better books,"Note, this is the sequal to True Believer. Unfortunately I didn't realize this until after I was already most of the way through the book. As usual Nicholas Sparks' novels are great for a mushy gushy, quick, romantic read, but I'm really noticing that a lot of the plots have the same basic building blocks. I will say that this is one of his better ones though. One of the reasons for this (for me at least) was because the ending was a little more realistic and not so ""happy ending"" as most of his other novels."
2,"Nicholas, did you have to do that?","Nicholas, you should be ashamed of yourself! After reading two books (this one and True Believer) trying to like Jeremy and Lexie and then you pull an ending like that. Couldn't you think of something else not quite so repulsive? Let me know next time and maybe I can suggest something.I have read 9 of your books and liked most of them immensely and the characters were easy to like and understand. Jeremy and Lexie do not fit that description. I didn't care for them right from the start and the further I read the less I cared for them.I will compliment you, however, on your writing skills. Even as unlikeable as the characters were, my attention was still held through both books. Maybe that was why I found the ending so distasteful -- I was too engrossed in the book.In all honesty, I will probably not read any more of your books, at least for a while, until my mind calms down from these books."
5,Nicholas Sparks,Loved the book. I would recommend it to my friends. I love to read sparks books because I recognize the places that he writes about.
5,best book ever read!!!!,"I loved this book, and I am a person that hates reading. I couldn't put it down it was so good. The more you read the more addicted it is :)"
4,review,"The book arrived in great condition, but I would have liked it to arrive sooner. Other wise, I will definitely buy from this seller again!"
2,NOT MY FAVORITE N.S.,"This is one of the saddest books Ive ever read...and not 'happy-sad', just plain 'sad-as-can-be sad'. It was good, not great, until the end. Why torture your loyal readers Mr. Sparks?"
3,Starts off well...,"I was quite engrossed in this novel until about 2/3 of the way through, when it seemed to turn into a primer for giving birth. I was hoping Jeremy, who is a bit of a doormat, would find someone else, as Lexie didn't appeal all that much, what with her secretiveness and selfishness, expecting him to move to boring Boone Creek, NC, from his home in NYC. I have read three other of N. Sparks' books (the first 2 and Rodanthe) and this was my least favorite, I think. I know I was suposed to cry when!!SPOLIER ALERT!!his wife passes away, but I didn't. I was more moved by J's bonding w/his new baby. Still, it's nice to see a man (Sparks) writing romance with such sensitivity and understanding, and I wish him the best success with future books."
3,Not as good as some of his others...,"I thought this book was just okay... It was quick reading and it did keep my interest. However, I knew somewhat how is was going to end. It's not one of Spark's best books, but it's still a good read."
2,the same story over again,"I didn't care for this story at all...I felt very manipulated by a formulaic bittersweet love story. It seems that this author has a formula where death (there's the bitter) is always involved and then something sweet comes of it in the end. However, just because a story tugs at one's heartstrings doesn't mean it's good."
4,"Much better than ""True Believer""","I thought that Nicholas Sparks had hit rock bottom when he wrote ""True Believer"", but he has taken the same two characters from that book and written something much better this time. He picks up the story of Lexie Darnell and Jeremy Marsh after they have become engaged and have discovered that Lexie is pregnant. They have some things to work out, such as city-boy Jeremy coming to live in a small North Carolina town where the morals and even the wardrobes are much different than what he's used to. They go through some ups and downs during their engagement, but eventually they work them out and.....Can't tell any more without spoiling the story, but be assured that this is a much better book than its predecessor."
4,"Drags at first, but wait...","I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks and was kind of disappointed with True Believer so I went in to it's sequel a little concerned about what kind of book this was going to be. I am not going to hash out the plot again because that has already been done, but I will say this, stick with the book because honestly the first 2/3 feels very thrown together. For most of this book, I found myself glad that I had gotten it from the library and was struggling to finish it. I am so glad that I did stick with it because for the last 3rd of this book I was hooked, it was amazing. The plot twist are so powerfully written that I had to go back and reread that section of the book to get the full emotional affect of it. I cried my eyes out both times I read it. Not many authors can make heroes and love come alive the way Mr. Sparks can. I for one, can not wait for his next book."
3,"A good book, but not his best...","Nicholas Sparks is known for his ability to touch the heart of the reader through the relationships of his characters. As with True Believer, At First Sight is a solid book, but not one of Sparks' best. Here we are brought up to speed with characters we first met in True Believer, but here the realistic character portrayals that Sparks usually captures are somewhat lacking. Although the story is touching in parts (especially near the end of the book), it does not successfully leave you with the same overwhelming emotional attachment to the characters that you will find in other Sparks' novels."
2,Wish I never read it,"Hi, I bought this book in September and just finished it in January. I know there was not as much time to read because of the holidays...but I dreaded picking up the book, it did not hold my attention. The ending made me raise my voice to I dare him write such a cheap ending...and all that detail about the prgenancy itself..to much info. I will not give up on him and I do have the Wedding on my desk right now, I still have faith, Take your time we would rather have less of really good writing, then a whole bunch of cra..."
1,Sparks worst novel,Although I didn't love True Believer I liked it enough to want to read the continuation of Lexie and Jeremy in At First Sight. I read about two thirds through and then just skimmed the rest of the book because I lost all interest. I don't mind a sad ending (loved The Notebook and A Walk to Remember) but the plot line was so dragged out that I was completely bored. The details of the pregnancy did not make for good reading and were too drawn out. The ending couldn't come fast enough for me--definitely his worst novel and I have read them all.
3,Has Nicholas Sparks lost his Spark?,"I was so excited to read this book, because I could not wait to continue reading about the characters from his previous book, True Believer. The book started out strong, but by the middle of the book, it felt very forced. I had to force myself to continue reading this book. It was not a typical Nicholas Sparks book that I could not put down. Frankly, it got boring. And the obvious foreshadowing ruined the ending of the book. Not one of the top books of 2005."
5,Online book,Enjoyed reading the book on my iPad. The book was as good as the oter books I have read by Nicholas sparks.
2,Skipped thru this one,"I didn't care much for the first in the series, and this one wasn't any better. What has happened to this author? It was just dragging on, so I skipped to the end. Actually I liked the end, it was the whole middle that was boring. Glad I got it from the library and didn't spend any money on it."
2,New to Nicholas Sparks novels,"I've been wanting to read a novel by Nick Sparks for some time, but when choosing my next book, somehow always passed on his. This time around i was determined and chose ""At First Sight"" randomly from his titles.The beginning didn't grab my attention as with some other novels, but i read on. After a few chapters i still was not attracted to the script and found it harder to follow along. Both main characters, Jeremy and Lexie, had weaknesses and were unrelatable. I found myself disliking them both at various points in the book. I did like the grandmother's character Doris, she seemed more realistic and did not annoy me. The plot was simple and many plot lines were not developed enough. I always felt like there was an intro and an end, but the body was missing.I am dissapointed in this novel. My expectations were much higher for Nicholas Sparks, he has an excellent reputation. I will try another one of his titles but i would not recommend reading this one."
2,Another formula book,"The first 2 or three Sparks books that I read were pretty good. Entertaining and a mindless read that didn't take a lot of brain power. I passed them on to my 16 year old and she loves them. My objection is that they are all the same story with mostly the same characters. The names are just changed. Since my teen still likes them, I buy her the new one that inevitably comes out every Christmas. But you know your in trouble when you go to the book store, can't remember the authors name, so describe the story line to the clerk and they instantly come up with Nicholas Sparks. My description went something like this. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, girl dies. Not to mention the Christianity plug that is inserted more and more into every book. I am seriously wondering if Sparks even writes his own books anymore. If you really want to read these books, borrow them."
3,Good book,"Jeremy and Lexie's story is one to read slowly and treasure. I really enjoyed this novel, as well as all of Nicholas Sparks's other novels. He's a gifted writer. Definitely check out Three Weeks With My Brother if you haven't already. That one made me cry, mostly because it was his true life story. Wow!"
2,what,"I was given this book as a hand-me-down by a coworker, and having heard about this author, I decided to give it a try. This was my first Nicholas Sparks book, so I read with an open mind and none of his other works to compare to this one. I found this story insubstantial and somewhat filler-ish, and wondered if Mr. Sparks always wrote like this.It is not until I come onto this site and see the reviews here that I realize that this was a continuation of another book. Given the disappointing ending to this book, I have no interest in reading the other one. I was prepared to give up on this author after this book, but after seeing some of the reviews here, I think I will read one of his higher-rated books and give him another chance."
4,Better than True Believer,I really enjoyed this book. I read True Believer first and then started this one. True Believer was good but long to read. I couldn't really get into the story. Loved the characters but struggled with the writting of it. But I have this wierd thing that even if the book is slow I finish it because I can't handle not knowing what happened. This book moved alot easier. Loved the process of them learning about each other. And CRIED like a baby! Good book...defiently would recommend.
2,Lay off the clichés!,"I had to force myself to finish this book. I have never read anything by Sparks before and given a number of the reviews on ""At first sight"" I take it this is an unusual low for him. The book is very boring at first and never really gets going until the end. But what really messed up the book for me was all the clichés like ""Jeremy hoped she wasn't one of those girls who slept in a green mask"" etc. It was just plain ridiculous. I'm all for a good romantic novel but downgrading women to stupidity like Sparks does is no necessity for a good romantic story. This book was definitely written to be made into a movie and even then it wouldn't be all that good.And even though the end takes you by surprise it is not enough to make this a somewhat decent book."
3,Real life writing,"Even though I don't think this is one of Spark's better books, it is good in the aspect that it the most realisitic book he has written. Stuff like this happens to people all over the world and it was a nice change to see it from start to finish to the story of these to characters and how it all came to a full circle. The book shows how life can really be and the point I took from it is to live life to the fullest everyday with the people you love especially in that situation becuase you just never know how things can change in an istant."
3,New Suprise at the End,Very good but a suprise at the ending that made me re-think this book. It could have been different and therefore led to another or a trilogy in this area.
1,Should have by-passed this one,"The other reviews say it all. This book has no plot, story, or romance. It's not worth finishing. I don't like this authors style. I read for gaining knowledge and entertainment not shedding tears."
2,Substandard,"I love, LOVE Nicholas Sparks' books. I have purchased all of them in hardback, and I do that with few authors. I love his voice and his character development. However, this book was a major disappointment.The story started slowly -- I didn't get very interested in the book until I was nearly halfway through it. The dialogue often felt forced, and the internal dialogue often immature. I felt like I was watching the ending of ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"", again -- there were too many false endings, yet the story kept going on and on.I won't immediately buy his next release. I'll wait and read the reviews first."
3,"Great story, but......","....if Nicholas Sparks doesn't ""lighten up"" this may be the last of his books that I read. His stories are beautiful, well written, and once I get started reading one of them, I can't put it down. After having read everything he's written so far though, I've gotten to the point that while I'm enjoying the story and the characters, I'm also dreading what's going to happen in the end. For anyone who is not familiar with Nicholas Spark's books, read True Believer BEFORE you read At First Sight. Note: I gave this book 3 stars because of the ending, not because of the writing."
1,RmLamatt author of Fears Flutterby,"I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it."
2,Very Disappointing Read,"I am glad that I borrowed this book from the library instead of buying it. I was very anxious to read this book, but very disappointed in it. The characters were flat, and the plot seemed totally contrived.I had a very complicated pregnancy and doubt that the doctors would have let Lexi carry the baby to term. More than likely, she would have had a C-section before the due date. If that had happened in the book, then everything would have been ok, and Nicholas Sparks would have written a much more realistic book.Do not waste your time or money on this book."
2,We need new authors!,"Does it seem, to anyone else that once an author hits the best sellers list, they stay there no matter what fluff they churn out? I really enjoied Sparks earlier work, but come on, two books about these poor pathetic people who just want a happily ever after.To be fair, Sparks is an honest writer, and he has the ability to make people feel. I saw it comming and still got all misty. But I don't endorse it."
1,Disapponited!!,"This was my very first novel by Sparks. I was soo looking forward to a good tear-jerker love novel, since I know of his work because the ""The Notebook"", the movie. Instead, I was very disapponited. I seen the ending coming and I agree with another comment, the main female character, made me mad, leaving me not to feel for her at the end. Mr. Sparks, I don't want to give up on you so soon but I think I need to come back to you at a later time. Any recommendation?"
1,200 pages of overused cliches later ...,"After reading this book, I feel like Nicholas Sparks woke up in the middle of the night and went ""aha! tearjerker moment!"" and then quickly slapped together a story in order to get his ""tearjerker moment"" published. He could have easily done away with the first 200 + pages of the book, possibly leaving a better story at the end. I liked True Believer (enough to look forward to this one, anyway) as well as a few of his other books. This book was unsatisfying, the drama felt forced and the dialog dry. It was full of cliches', which made it feel poorly written. If it were his first book, perhaps I would be a little more understanding, but he's written so many! Any writer worth their stock should know to avoid the phrase, ""And for the first time in what felt like forever"".Very disappointed in this one. Would not recommend it, will not read it again."
3,Better than True Believer,"I enjoyed this book much more than True Believer. It's not super-high on character development and almost assumes you've read True Believer, but this one is much less predictable in its outcome and more worthy of your trusty Kleenex box.I could sincerely feel the way Lexie became less trustworthy in Jeremy's opinion. In fact, I wondered if indeed she WAS 'up to no good'. The trials of a young couple presented throughout the book are troubles a ""real"" couple could face.The end of this book is startling, and realistic in its emotion-I had no doubt I'd feel as Jeremy did if I were in his place.Even so, for some reason I was not nearly as spellbound as I found myself while reading Sparks' The Notebook. In a way, I feel True Believer and At First Sight could-and should-have been combined to make one four-star book. IMHO, separately each is really no better than his average."
1,I'm Through With Nicholas Sparks,"** CAUTION - MAJOR PLOT SPOILER!! **I started out as a Nicholas Sparks fan. The first few books I read of his were excellent. I felt he had the ability to provide a lot of dimension and insight into his characters. ""The Notebook"", ""The Wedding"" and ""The Bend In The Road"" were perfect examples. Unfortunately, I think he's beginning to run out of ideas. Too many of his books end up with a major character dying. Sorry - I even think I'll pass on the next one."
2,At First Sight,"I have read all of Sparks' books, and have liked most of them, but this one was such a disapointment to me. The non-original plot of a story line, the added wannabe creepy mystery about its characters, and the horrible ending were anything but enjoyable. Why let your leading lady die in the end of the book? I would have enjoyed it better if she had lived and it was candy and cake for everyone as they lived happily ever after....yadda, yadda, yadda... How sad for Sparks' readers to have to be put through what can be called ""dental surgery"" of a book, sorry, Nick, but this one was not your best. Don't bother reading this one...it's going in my garage sale pile for a $1...."
2,At First Sight is a repeat sight,"This book is merely another written story of the movie ""She's Having My Baby"", very sappy, very predictable and truly NOT one of his better. Good for light reading on a snowy day, but will never be called great literature. I was very dissapointed."
3,Wish I knew...,"I will try not to be a spoiler, but, I wish I had slightly more of an inkling about the ""surprise"" ending in this book. I am eight months pregnant and have finished three books in the last month... which says a lot for me. I was so mad and disturbed that I spent time investing in Lexie and Jeremy only to experience the tragic ending that was awfully disturbing to this first time mom to be. As other reviewers have written, I kept waiting for something to happen, and well, I guess it did. I'm just mad I had to be a part of it."
4,A great knitwit,I purchased this book for a fellow knitter sight unseen. She was lucky to get it. I will be acquiring multiple copies of this book for my knitting friends. The instructions are clear and the writing style is charming. The illustrations are fun vintage images. A necessary book for every knitter.
4,Good knitting book,This is a good reference book. I would recommend it to the basic knitter. I prefer color pictures rather that b&w.
5,Brilliant,"I bought this CD a couple weeks ago after it had been suggested by a close friend. I was a little wary about it, because the name wasn't too familiar but low and behold! Holy Mountain is brilliant. As a writer I look at everything for inspiration and these recordings are beyond inspirational. Winterwind is a beautiful and absolutely vivid recording. You can feel the gusts of cold and snow brushing over your face when you listen to this track. The CD is brilliant. Hats off to Mr. Bez! To anyone on the border between buying this CD or not, you would be making a grave mistake living your life without it."
1,A Boring Read,Halfway through this book I wanted to scream stop The Train I want to get off.The book was so boring it revoles around Hannah and her friends from Parker High.They are going on a tour from chicago to San Francisco by Train(hence the name of the book).Yet while on the train in the baggage department they discover a coffin.After reading the tag on the coffin the find out that it holds the body of a classmate of theirs named Roger.None of them liked Roger they all called him Frog.Then they all begin discussing how they treated Roger badly and they start feeling guilty about it.Soon bad things start happening and people are getting hurt.Hannah starts wondering if Frog is really dead?So she and her friends set out to find out.
4,"Strong plot, intelligent story","The Bureau sends Quiller to Bangkok to protect an important British official who will be visiting Thailand. Quiller approaches the job in his usual efficient (albeit grouchy) style, but finds himself outsmarted ... at least for awhile.Quiller is a well-defined character: independent, even anti-social, perhaps suffering from a (perhaps justified) superiority complex. The other characters are more like caricatures, but the enjoyment of this novel comes from the intricate, twisty plot and from Quiller himself as he tries to out-think his adversary. Quiller is an intellectual spy, but there's plenty of action to offset the thinking and scheming. Fans of espionage/thriller novels should enjoy this."
2,Predictable,"What started as quite interesting, turned out to be rather mundane. Quiller, super-brain and second in world-importance only to The Person, fails to foresee what most readers would have guessed from the beginning. Never once does he suspect that when everything goes ever-so smoothly, something may not be quite as it seems. When I bought this e-book, I was thinking of ""The Quiller Memorandum"" which I remembered as very good. ""The Ninth Directive"" didn't come close to it, in my mind."
4,Trademark house set from one of the USA's finest DJ's,"If you like house, you've definitely heard this disc. If you don't know what house is, this is the one disc you should hear. Farina starts off this set with three ass-shakin' deep house tracks: ""Flame,"" ""Dreams of You"" and ""I Know"" and then eases his way into a funky and groovy house set starting with ""Feel your Body Talkin'."" Personally, I like the first 15-20 minutes of this album the most, especially ""I Know,"" which is an underground classic. Yet, the rest of the album is very good and would pack any dancefloor from Chicago to San Fran to Atlanta."
3,movie,Keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is a good action movie. It has good character in this movie
4,A Must for Nicholas Cage Fans,"""Red Rock West"" is a very, very quirky film, which never steps outside the bounds of hard reality. This is one of my favorite (small) Nicholas Cage films. There are no special effects here. Everything is carried along skillfully with the pure acting talents of its four main characters. Cage gets caught up in a somewhat complicated plot between a married couple who both want to murder each other. Adding to the threatening mayhem is Dennis Hopper who is in top form as a killer-for-hire. Who has the upper-hand at any given moment shifts around, but other than Cage, it's topsy turvey over the motives of the married couple, and exactly what Hopper will settle for. The ending is right on the money. The moral of the story may be that if your a down-on-your-luck drifter passing through Texas, you might want to think twice about any easy jobs that seem to fall into your lap."
4,Modern noir,"A penniless drifter (Nicholas Cage) becomes trapped in the machinations of greedy, ruthless people when he is mistaken for ""Lyle from Texas,"" a hired killer. He thinks he can take the advance money for a murder, warn the victim (Lara Flynn Boyle), and run, but obviously it doesn't work out as smoothly as that. Director John Dahl co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Rick Dahl, and the two men clearly have a great love for and deep understanding of the genre of film noir. This clever, involving film about people who are in over their heads depends a bit too much on coincidence at a few crucial junctures, but it remains a very entertaining film. Dennis Hopper plays a more restrained version of the psycho he patented in ""Blue Velvet,"" and the great character actor J.T. Walsh delivers a memorable performance."
5,"Terrific, funny thriller","This is as good as contemporary noir gets. What a story! All the performances are good, as is the absolutely perfect last line, one of filmdom's greats -- ""I asked for Red Rock."" The only reservation I have, and I'll try to keep this from being a spoiler, is that Dennis Hopper's final moment onscreen is a bit hard to swallow. But hey -- I love this little thriller."
4,no title,"I know I would have liked this a whole lot better if practically anyone but Nicholas Cage was the star, but I have to admit, he was very good here. This reminded me so much of the noir ""After Dark, My Sweet"", except there really isn't any love story. But the small town atmosphere, the drifter caught up, mostly because of a woman, the crazy bad guy, the greed-lust for money, the bedroom scene, are all there in both. This one had far more plot turns and twists, and was almost comic in its relentless violence. It was definitely a film noir, almost all scenes were at night, even in a graveyard. I was definitely caught up in this movie and many of the plot turns took me by surprise. Shot in Wyoming, the scenery was generally stark and bare in the few daylight scenes. Cage was almost a little too good to be true, but maybe not. Maybe I'm just cynical. With Dennis Hopper, J. T. Walsh, and Lara Flyn Boyle."
4,A real sleeper of a thriller with many twists!,"This much overlooked little gem is on par with such films as Blood Simple,Fargo and One False Move. First time director John Dahl(The Last Seduction)also co-wrote this twister. The movie effectively keeps the viewers interested throughout the many plot twists. A stellar cast and a terrific small town setting add to the movie's charm. Do yourself a favour and add this baby to your collection."
4,"Good neo-noir, tries to hard at times.","This was an enjoyable example of an often forgotten genre, the film noir.Nicolas Cage gives his best performance (with the exception of leaving las vegas) in this film. Dennis Hopper is especially good, and his entrance in the film is at exactly the right moment.The plot, with a tavern keeper mistaking a down on his luck drifter for a hired assassin, is clever, intriguing and provides for lots of great moments. The film has plenty of twists, and is suitably dark, depressing, and lacking in hope.The only problem is Lara Flynn Boyle. She's trying too hard, and it especially comes across as wrong because Cage and Hopper are so smooth and comfortable in their roles. She operates better as a thought in the back of Cage's head then when she is actually on screen.Still, very well done, though the ending scene cuts out a little abruptly (kind of like the maltese falcon, but way shorter). Worth seeing for those who like noir."
3,cage and hopper...about time,"If you're a Nicolas Cage fan, as I am,this is a typical violent action piece for you. Cage's character has a conscience and he has trouble doing his appointed job properly. Hopper is in his prime as ruthless killer, where Lara Flynn Boyle is in a different role for her, but holds her own in strong male cast.The movie cruises along with the showdown being predictable but quite enjoyable. Not a favourite of mine, but good enough."
3,Great Movie,This is a great little movie from early in Cage's career. A good cast and a surprising story.
3,Entertaining but unsatisfying,"Red Rock West is entertaining, but ultimately unsatisfying. It is a story of thieves trying to double-cross each other for money they have stolen. The contrived plot ensures everyone the chance to double-cross everyone else. In this respect, it soon becomes predictable."
5,"entertaining, informative, down-to-earth, plain English","my key words to describe ""key financial instruments"": refreshing, demystifying, entertaining, informative, down-to-earth, plain English. It does not go into the very fine detailed specifications of financial instruments - but these are covered in dozens of other books. The book gives a glimpse of the soul of the financial markets"
5,incredibly well written,incredibly well written - like JK Rowling of Harry Potter and Michael Lewis of Liar's Poker combined
5,the only readable book on derivatives I have come across,I have just read the first three chapters and it looks like I'll finish it soon. Key Financial Instruments is the only readable book on derivatives that I have come across.
2,A Outline Style Book,"This book gives only outline rathen than details. And the sentence appears most is ""For more information on XXXX, see XXXX in Visual InterDev Help"". A beginner should not buy it for its lack of details and examples. A advanced developer should not buy it either for its lack of reference value."
1,Needs a technical editor,This book is terrible. The Labs are fraught with errors. I am very dissapointed that Microsoft Press would put out such a book about a product (VI) that they sell. They must not have had a technical editor go through the book. Don't waste your money.
1,Call it InterDev for Dummies,"The Mastering Series is poor book for mastering ASP. Consider it a basic help file with some simple examples. To learn ASP and InterDev, get the Wrox book. Microsoft Press should be embarassed putting out this material."
2,No JavaScript for Client Scripting,"The samples in the book are not much of use, since they are writen in VBScript and are not supported by Netscape."
1,Disappointing!,"There is very little actual content in this book. Explanations of the topics are sketchy and often with insufficient context. Also, there are not enough examples. If you are a beginner (like me) you will find this book very frustrating. If you're not, you don't need it."
1,Mediocre at best,"A well organized tutorial that stops short of telling you anything truly useful. The MSDN help is just as useful(less). Extremely disappointed in the lack of any discussion about installation of an application in any manner other than http deployment. Very little, if any, conceptual discussions."
1,Worthless. Won't measure PSI at all,I purchased this to measure the pressure in my reverse osmosis system. It doesn't measure the PSI at all. I think the problem is with the design of the head that you attach to the stem/valve of whatever you are trying to measure. It just doesn't look right and is very cheap plastic. Stay away from this and choose a different product.
3,Partly outdated but...,"...worth reading for Patsy Lacker's contribution and the interviews in the last part. The bulk of the book, provided by Marty Lacker, is but a sanitized version of his later contribution to the book by Alanna Nash on the Memphis Mafia.Patsy's memories tell much of the story as it came to be known after the first revelations by the West and Habler. And her perspective being different from that of the guys makes it worthwhile reading it. I liked the Schilling interview too, much more than his glorifying and useless recent book. I wonder why no pic of Patsy is included, at least in the paperback edition I read. Strange also to read John Wilkinson (in an interview given to Guitar Player and quoted here) saying that no live version of Kentucky Rain was ever attempted because too difficult to play (at youtube you can find a couple of versions made in Vegas)."
3,A whitewash Book,"I am reading the book now and I am almost finished. It was very boring in parts but gave no real insight to Elvis's life. Now, I have to say, I have read almost 25 books on his life so most of this is repeat stuff. But the book is a white wash of his life.Give you an example, Marty Lacker stated that Dr. Nick first visited Elvis at Circle G because he had a bad cold. Not true, according to Dr. Nick, Elvis had saddle sores on his buttocks from riding his horse at the ranch. Why not just tell the truth? No mention of drugs, sex and other stuff.I did enjoy reading about his generousity and kindness. I just think for the sake of truth both sides should be shared to bring balance."
1,"ELVIS PAID OUR BILLS, NOW HE'S GONE","ANOTHER ""TRUE"" STORY WRITTEN BY DISGRUNTLED EX-EMPLOYEES.THIS ONE QUICLY FOLLOWED THE COURSE OF THOSE WHO ONCE""WORKED"" FOR ELVIS (FREE CARS, JEWELERY,ETC.-HOW ROUGH),COMPLAINING ABOUT HIS LIFESTYLE,SINCE NOW THEY NEED TOSUPPORT THEMSELVES AS STORYTELLERS.

NO ONE WILL REMEMBER THEMANYWAYS!"
5,Spyderco Ladybug 3,Great knife; my second one. Knew some Seals in the Delta that took these out on patrol (won't say where they put them).
4,handy and sharp,"This is my third ladybug. Yes, they are small and easy to loose, but I love it! It's sharp, handy and has a great feel. Sypderco easy open blade that locks securely. I'm not easy on it, I use it like any other knife. I will agree it's a little expensive, but I think it's worth the price."
1,highly disappointed,i was recommended to purchase joel harrison's recording and found it to besomewhat boring it could be called pop gone modern and utterly boring.
5,Don't miss this one!,"This is a great read. The author, Rik Palieri, takes you on tour in America (with side trips to Poland, Germany and elsewhere), but you're not watching through a tinted tourbus window. You're on the ground, seeing people and places that you'll never come across in a travel guidebook. Rik has been on the road for years as a travelling folk musician, gathering songs and stories. Beyond the odd assortment of characters and places he describes, he also gives you a bit of the history of American folk music. This is both informative and highly entertaining. Mr. Palieri not only has some incredible stories to tell, but he is a talented storyteller. The book reads with a folksy down-to-earth cadence. So sit back in your comfy chair and get on the road!"
5,Wonderful Teller of Tales,"Truly a mesmerizing and insightful work from what, I understand, to be a new author. You really get the feeling of the life of a road musician--or warrior of music and life, if you will.In addition, besides a great writing style,there are wonderful insights into the life and loves of the author that we can all learn from"
2,Plain Old Techno,"Inoffensive, uninteresting, bland, plain, harmless. These are all words that describe this unexciting electronic offering. It's better than silence, but there's really not much to it."
2,not the best,"Cute looking sneaker, interesting design. My daughter did like the look, easy for her to put on but after a week or so the velcro would not stay closed, kept lifting, and we could no longer use the sneaker. Never had this problem with a velcro closure before, was not a problem with fit or width, just the strength of the velcro."
4,A great introductory text and a valuable reference.,"This is a very good introductory text to the often complex world of discrete and analogue signal processing. I used this throughout college and still refer to it. Lynn's coverage is complete and clear, with well-chosen examples and adaptable BASIC programs (which could be easily rewritten as MATLAB scripts). If you need a good primer that can be used later as a reference, I can recommend this book."
4,"Exciting, Simple","One of the best CDs I've bought in a long time. The grace and sophistication of Baca's voice are allowed to shine on this one. Many of her recordings have been marked by over-production or color-by-number arrangements that blunted the beauty of her voice. Not this one. Baca's voice is sexy, even more so because of the restraint she shows. Where most vocalists would cut loose with vocal aerobatics Baca teases you with simple and deliberate control. The band is clean, imaginitive and simple. Top quality arrangements don't allow the band to hide. Lesser musicians would have fallen flat. These guys offer shifts and solos that are so clean they cause you to grin."
5,GIGI PLASTIC TEES,Excellentt tees... All my golf buddies love them also. I will be placing another order. Each round of golf I play someone is asking me for the plastic tees...
1,what were they thinking,"When I first saw this movie for sale I was glad. It was originally titled The Greatest Battle. Stacy Keach, Henry Fonda, and a number of other stars highlighted the film. However that is the good news. The DVD itself is a piece of garbage which will play once on one of my DVD players while it will play again and again on my other player. Cascadia media company should have made sure what they were selling. The title for one is now dubbed in Battle Force. The picture quality must have been taken from a VHS tape that was recorded in LP or Extended Play. The sound quality is just as bad."
3,Well Jay Z was not there LP was though,I am a big rap fan but Jigga did not bring it to goo.Linkin Park did a nice beat and there music sounds better on a live version then in the studio. Half and Half afair
1,really lousy,"i don't much care for Linkin Park, but I'm a huge Jay-Z fan, and this mash-up song completely ruined Encore. the last reviewer was right-on, the original beat producted by Kanye West was excellent and Encore wasn't a song to mess with. unfortuately they did mess with it, and they butchered it too."
2,Not all that,"Encore first appeared on Jay-Z's ""The Black Album"", and let me just say, it doesn't ""mash up"" well with Numb by Linkin Park. The great original beat produced by Kanye West is replaced by what sounds like a phone being dialed, and it just doesn't work with the epic context of Jay-Z's lyrics. There were decent mash-ups on the CD they put out, this wasn't one of them."
2,a nice album,"The album does not live up to the ""hype"". It's the kind of album you buy on vacation then go home, put it in your cd rack and never pull it out again. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad; in fact the musicianship is very, very good. But unique it isn't."
3,boring town under seige...,"... or 2.5 stars due to not that entertaining enough @ all. they only show the red ball meteor in space. the story, acting, situation, affects & action-pretty boring."
3,This DVD is good but could be much better!,"Apart from the trailer, there is no bonus. There is not the French track, too bad! But the delivery service was very good. Received quickly and in good condition."
4,City Beneath the Sea,"I saw this when I was a kid and have looked for an official version for years. It's a really good (for TV) science fiction movie from the early 1970's. Irwin Allen uses some of his cast from his earlier TV series which is nice. Okay, some of the sets obviously look like models but it's still a fun movie from the ""Master of Disaster"" who, with this movie looked to be testing the waters so to speak for making his big screen disaster pictures later on. This burned on demand dvd may be as ""official"" as it's going to get. The picture and sound are decent, however there are no scene selection menus, and they only have chapter markers set at 10 minute intervals which is a practically useless feature. There is one extra, the original trailer for the movie."
3,ITS NOT BAD....,its good if you like old sci-fi. adventure. the sets are good. the acting is ok. i like the stars in it.
1,What is gun control?,"Do you truly wish felons, terrorists, mentally ill, and other ""disqualified"" people can acquire firearms? Does the possibility of armed criminals scare you?If you answered yes to either of those questions, or both of those quentions, then you believe in gun control.The problem is that ""gun control"" is an amorphous subject, rather like tyranny. One person's tyranny can be another's freedom.One person fears losing his firearms, the other his ability to walk the streets without fear of being shot.The problem is that most people, even those who claim to be RKBA, actually would like to see gun control. The problem is that both sides have clouded the topic and don't work toward consensus.This book is divisive and counterproductive. The title reeks of ""gun nut"" in all its negative connotations.I would suggest reading a book that is unbiased in discussing the politics of ""gun control"" and tries to dispassionately examine the topic rather than this book."
5,Ice Bowl: I Was There,"My uncle took me to the Dec 31,1967 NFL Championship game between the Cowboys and Packers, better known as the ice bowl. I was a high school senior. I have always remembered that it was -13 degrees with a 20 mph wind blowing into the open north end of the stadium. It wasn't until I read this book that I realized the wind chill by the end of the game was -56 degrees. Now I live in Texas where 100 degree summer days are the norm. On hot days I reread the book and watch the video. The Texas heat doesn't seem so bad."
2,The CSI head haunts me.,"Okay, I'll admit that this toy is pretty educational. But those eyes, man! Those EYES! The head will sit in your child's room, and most likely face the door. Every time you walk by it will be staring at you, waiting to make its move, plotting your demise - or at least that's what it feels like.Maybe if the head didn't have such an accusatory look on its face (""WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?"") it wouldn't scare the bejezus out of me.My own personal fears aside, what kind of parent gives this toy to their kids? And what kind of sick, morbid child would want to play with a toy like this? ""Merry Christmas Timmy! Here's your CSI Facial Reconstruction head. Now you can reconstruct the ruined face of the victim of a violent and gruesome murder!"" That's how you start a kid on a path that ends at the top of a clock tower with a sniper rifle."
1,CSI I ask WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11,This THING is grotesqe.Who plays with creeps that STARE AT YOU(...)????
5,wow 2012,"this is a good one, got this to play for warm up in my sunday school class, kids enjoy the music in the background"
5,If you are going to get married READ this book,"I first got this book 15 years ago...from a friend and have read and re-read it many times. I am happily married with two wonderful kids and my wife thinks its a gas as well. The one stars are obviously from chicks who fit the ""mould"" and are upset at being found out. I wonder if everyone knows who the author is? He is or was a commercial pilot for a major airline and has paid MILLIONS to his ex-wives. Boys, read this and look at your lover....and laugh"
1,Predation knows no gender.,"While the book may have some valid points, the principle of predation applies equally to men. This is a human condition, not one limited to the female gender."
1,Very funny but spare me the seriousness,It sad to know that guys actually took this stuff seriously. Hey talk about a predator he just made you guys pay back his divorce loss. To need this as a guide is extremely weak. I wish females could read this book learn how to become predators...because as far as we are concerned we are not that slick as Mr.Shannon (Mr. I really had a bad experience in divorce court and hey I was never responsible so here are my reasons why it was all her fault) thinks. I really thought guys were smarter than this. Oh well if you want to laugh it's a five star book. It just so ridiculos and extreme that you just wanna laugh out loud.
1,A misogynistic rant,"I do not understand the praise for this book. I'm no big fan of the way many (perhaps most) women behave, but this book is just chock-full of poorly researched, baseless drivel. Don't waste you time, money or effort on this rubbish."
1,Misogonystic Reverend demonstrates his ignorance,"This was the most misogynistic book I've ever read. If you want facts about the difference in the sexes, read Warren Farrells' ""The Myth of Male Power."" But this book was insane. It's as biased and idiotic as the books radical feminists have been writing, like ""Men who hate women and the women who love them"".Women can't get enough books about how horrible men are. Well this is the the same trash from the other perspective. I thought we were above that. I was wrong. This book is just juvenille, petty and moronic finger pointing."
3,"A helpful book, but not worth the money","This book has a lot of information, but most of it can be found easily through your agency or through the ""Familys with Children from China"" website. The book has a lot of great website addresses.The main issue with this book is that it is very poorly written. With all of the things adoptive parents need to sift through in this process, we certainly do not need to decipher bad grammar, typos, etc. On one page, the author talks about going to Moscow to pick up your child--clearly this was just a cut/paste from the ""Adopting from Russia"" book he wrote, and no one bothered to proof his work."
3,Good as an introduction,"This book provided a lot of overview/general information. While the information was useful, I obtained the same information from a simple Google search and didn't have to pay for it. In fact, I've found more extensive information readily available on the internet than was available in this book. For someone not even sure how to begin, this book may be helpful for the basics, but even those will become outdated as things in the Chinese adoption process change. I'd recommend passing on this book."
3,Still a good movie,Mr. Cagney is still as good today as he was 60 years ago. I saw this movie back in the 50/s and it is still worth the time and money.
3,"60-minunte documentary, 30 minutes suspense","This is more of a documentary at times than a movie, but it's decent. It's not the normal exciting gangster fare than Cagney excelled in, but it's okay.The first hour is a bit slow with the documentary style and then the last 35 minutes picks up considerably as the spy story is played out in dramatic fashion. Cagney was starting to show his age a bit but he still was pretty spry.Richard Conte does a nice job as the German disguising himself as an American and eventually has a showdown with Cagney. That's in the suspenseful last 30 minutes which saves the film."
2,Disappointing,"Love Jimmy Cagney and B/W movies, but this one felt a little flat.I won't divulge any spoilers, but the title is misleading... it only makes sense in the final few moments of the movie. This isn't about an address in wartime Paris, it's about an organization created to respond to a threat and an just such a threat coming to fruition and the alied response."
5,Quintessential Quartet,"Paris, 1966THE quartet that defines the sound, the movement, that is ... the music.How four musicians could create such space/time, dynamics, melody, force and grace.Excellent recording quality of course.Forever thank you to Cecil, Andrew, Alan and Jimmy.There are not enough words to set the context and history, think of the other great musics being created in 1966yet like all the greats, completely timeless and pricelessThere are none better. If you found these recordings then you already know.Great Paris Concert for once lives up to it's billing."
3,Not necessary if you buy the Handibook for Genealogists.,"Good in that it is more portable than the giant ""Handibook for Genealogists"", but this state census book seems kind of old. I'm a bit worried that some of the state census records might have been moved to other repositories. I'd call first before writing to the repository listed in this book."
3,Excellent Resource,I have been tracing my family genealogy on and off for 20 years. The federal census in a great resource but having the status census can help fill in gaps or help locate relatives that get lost in the 10 year period between the federal census. This book has been an invaluable tool in my big tool box. A must have for any genealogist!
1,Usless,"I find this book to be a big waste of money. I thought for $ 17.00 I would get some useful information, I found it to be lacking in anything useful or worthwhile. Do not waste your money on this one. If I could give it a zero rating that is what it would have."
2,Not Really All That It Could Be,"All the themes are easily recognized, as stated in previous reviews, but on the whole I don't think it's worth 5 stars. The ""Peter Gunn"" theme is not the popular Henry Mancini version, but still good. ""Goldfinger"" just doesn't sound the same without Shirley Bassy singing it. The version on this cd is by Billy Strange trying very hard to sound like Al Caiola. Yuk! Also ""The Avengers"" isn't the kosher tv theme. Okay, so some of the themes were 'stretched' out a bit, which I have no problem with. Lalo Schrifrin's ""Mission: Impossible"" and Mike Post's ""Hill Street Blues"" really saved this cd. If you're just looking for familiar themes it's a good album. Just be prepared to be a little disappointed."
2,Not all that it could be,"All the themes are easily recognized, as stated in previous reviews, but on the whole I don't think it's worth 5 stars. The ""Peter Gunn"" theme is not the popular Henry Mancini version, but still good. ""Goldfinger"" just doesn't sound the same without Shirley Bassy singing it. The version on this cd is by Billy Strange trying very hard to sound like Al Caiola. Yuk! Also ""The Avengers"" isn't the kosher tv theme. Okay, so some of the themes were 'stretched' out a bit, which I have no problem with. Lalo Schrifrin's ""Mission: Impossible"" and Mike Post's ""Hill Street Blues"" really saved this cd. If you're just looking for familiar themes it's a good album. Just be prepared to be a little disappointed."
5,Pat Frank,An old and favorite author. I wish there were many more. He has the attitude of the times well established and makes me want more.
5,Good,Great and prompt delivery. Besides the book has interesting material perhaps more suited for professors and teachers or students pursuing a teaching career.
3,Kelly,Very nice product. In line with other eye creams at this price point. Not the best that I have tried but none the less good product.
5,Best paddle holster (lined) made,"This lined holster is high quality and cradles your M1911 is the soft lining.It is secure, comfortable, and easy to put on and take off with no need to unhoster the pistol.It is the best of the best.I highly recommend it."
3,Just Okay,I love the list of songs. I found pretty much all the ones my 3 and 4 year old boys have recently learned and want to sing at home. It all seems very monotone though. Kind of boring. Some songs seem way fast and others so slow but all in about the same tone of music.
4,Good CD,"This is a good CD with lots of good children's songs, however if I were lookingfor ""good singers"" I would have to choose something else. Once you get usedto the voices, it's not bad. But some of it sounds out of tune."
2,Not what I expected,"There was something wrong with the first cd, many of the songs came with a strange buzz in them. This collection has so many songs but the melodies are too similar, next time I'd choose quality rather than quantity."
2,Not Terrible...unless you listen to all three CD's back to back,"Let's face it--if ANYONE listens to 102 children's songs all in a row, they are going to become cross. In small doses, these songs are not awful. I am not especially fond of some of the smooth jazz arrangements, but the gentle melodies are not bad across the board. Disc one is the best, with the fewest annoying songs. And really, where else will you find 102 songs for $10?"
1,not all songs are for children please be aware,I sent this to my daughter as a little gift and she called me with excitement to be able to play in her car when she statred to listen through out the CD she was in shock to hear the son Teddy Teddy it promotes guns and violence she called me so upset that how did this song get onto a childs CD my only words I could say was I'm in shock as well and that the producers of the CD probably are not even aware that employees did such a mean act and if they were aware then shame on them they ruined a perfectly mix of old chilhood songs into a once again unacceptable CD.Really what's this planet coming to Amazon needs to pull it of the site of purchase.I will hope that amazon makes good on the review.
5,Interesting history...,"This was an interesting read. Napolitano is a Fox News Contributor who is an advocate of interpreting via natural law and reading the Constitution literally for it's intended meaning. As a result, the Fox News bashers will tend to ignore the book but it's worthy of their attention too because the leftwing liberal idea of reinterpeting the Constitution for today is what lead to legislation like the Patriot Act. In an unbiased way (politically), his criticisms of the current administration are well-balanced with a good explanation and examples of abuse. I've traditionally been a supporter of the Republicans and the Patriot act but the Judge's book have made me rethink the Patriot Act. I was also surprised at how far back in time some of the interpretation contraversies go, some dating back to Hamilton and Jefferson themselves."
3,A Good Cheap Sampler--but of a limited period,"Some artists are productive for a relatively brief period, while others continue to be interesting over a longer span of time. Count Basie belongs to the latter category, and while this CD is a good sampler of his best work during one of his most fertile periods (1939 to 1942), if you know his work, you can feel the absences here. There's a later recording of his signature song ""One O'Clock Jump,"" not the mid-30s original, and of course his post-WWII work for Verve (particularly his wonderful take on ""April in Paris"") is also missing, because the selection is limited by the focus on his work at a single recording label. Still, it's nice and cheap, and this is the period in which Lester and Dickie made the Count's sound truly formidable. Even though there's some overlap, if you got this CD and the new Ken Burns sampler, you'd have a great Basie collection for around twenty bucks. That might be the way to go."
1,NOT AMERICAN,"What a disgrace, these boots are MADE IN CHINA. For the price they are selling for this is ridiculous. Not worth the price for CHINESE MADE COWBOY BOOTS.I JUST BOUGHT A PAIR OF ARIAT SEDONA AND NOTICED THE BALANCE IS MAN-MADE. FURTHERMORE, THESE BOOTS ARE MADE IN CHINA. THEY ARE WORTHLESS. YOU TRY TO PASS THESE BOOTS FOR WESTERN/COWBOY BOOTS BUT THEY ARE WORTHLESS CHINESE BOOTS. WHAT A SHAME. I AM TELLING EVERYONE ABOUT THIS. IT IS NOT WORTH THE $140 I PAID. I AM RETURNING MY BOOTS. THEY ARE CHEAP GOODS."
5,Baby Boomers...........,"Baby Boomers are used to being called that in reference to many aspects of life today, but this clever book leaves you feeling great!!! ........especially if you are a Baby Boomer :)...........it is a walk down Memory Lane and leaves you feeling terrific about our lives...........most importantly, for me, it has you laughing out loud from the beginning to the end...........great book!! And ideal as a gift !!!"
4,a very good and unique book,"One of the few books available concerning burmese cuisine this book is definitly informative, and useful as a key to burmese flavour combinations and palate. I have had this book for over 15 years (I recommend page 103.. labour intensive but a family favourite and the only curry that my mum will clean her coffee grinder to make). True, there are no pictures, but I guess it let's you dream a bit, and it in no way detracts from the book; I mean who wants to try and make something look the way a food stylist has spent three hours on anyway? By and large the recipes are quite good and not too complicated... If there were a negative side to the book it would be that some recipes just arn't suited to western palates (even if they are authentic?), and have to be seen in the context of a multi dish meal with condiments and sauces. All in all, a facinating look at an undeservedly unknown cuisine and another lovely addition to the prolific Mr. Copeland Marks' oeuvre."
1,Absolute Junk,"I purchased this product from a big box store and chose this griddle because of the Wearever name. I have used Wearever cookware for over 20 years and have always been pleased with the quality for a relatively low price. This griddle has changed my mind. Within seconds of placing it on my stovetop, the sides warped and curled upward. I have since tried this pan on numerous heat settings, and even on the lowest setting it still warps. It flattens back out when it cools off, but what good is it when it's cool? It's completely unusable, probably dangerous, and could possibly damage my solid cooktop. Please buy a different pan."
3,Writing a will is just hanging around.,Still haven't developed a real interest in writing a will! It is something that needs to be done but something I really have no interest in anticipating!
5,These are Great! Easy Install!,"Bought them for myself for my birthday, one of my existing fogs was out in my 93 Range Rover.The box includes complete wires, a switch and even a cool looking fused relay.The install instructions are complete, as a ""Real"" man, of course I did not refer to them until complete. I don't stop for directions either.I was able to replace the first one in about 45 minutes. I was able to use the stock wiring harness, so basically no wiring, just wrenching.I will drive around with one new one old until the weekend when I have time to replace the other one. Even in daylight I can tell how much brighter this one is than the stock one.Faster than expected ground delivery, but Amazon does know it's my birthday.Scotty"
4,Interesting characters,I am a huge fan of Kaye Gibbons and I thought the characters in this story were interesting. I also liked the way each character ping-pongs off the other. I read this book in like one day.
4,"Akick in the seat of the pants, and then some.","This books makes one stop and think, this could happen to me. In today's world of battered women, it is a scary thing to see that things have not changed all that much.Once you pick this book up it's a hard one to lay back down. It leaves you reeling and trying to find the answer to the question why didn't she leave the bum.Thank Goodness that where it really counted she found a man who could make her feel happy again.I would highly recommend this book for a day at the beach reading."
5,"Finally, a book that understands a woman's grey areas.","Ironically, I read the book before Oprah found it. I found the book so close to the lives of strong women I have known; it was almost like reading someone's diary. I could read it again and laugh in all the right places and cry in all the right places too. This was definately a great read."
4,Pure Goodness!,"I have never considered myself a quick reader . . . I tend to get sidetracked and put a book back on the shelf before I even get half-way through. Not so with this wonderful Gibbons tale. I loved it for its simplicity and purity. Being from the south myself, I found the characters to be very real and tangible. I could not put this book down! It made me laugh out loud! It made me cry, too. It reminded me of the goodness I felt in reading ""Cold Sassy Tree"" by Olive Ann Burns. (If you've never read it, and you liked ""A Virtuous Woman"", I suggest you add it to your cart!)"
2,Didn't Hold My Attention,"I fail to see what all the rave was about regarding this book. This is the third book I have read from Oprah's book club, and so far, none of them have succeeded in keeping me interested. Books with storylines which switch back and forth from past to present are hard to follow, and this one was no exception. I bought this book at the same time I bought Kaye's other book, Ellen Foster, figuring I would read them one after another. However, I have not yet been able to bring myself to read Ellen Foster for fear of the same type of drudgery I endured reading this one. I might read another of her books if I pick one up at the library, but I sure won't waste my money buying one."
2,Thought it would never end !!!,"For being such a short book, I thought it was never going to end. I could only handle a page at a time before nodding off. This was not a love story, this was a couple not wanting to live life alone so ""what the heck"" lets get married and we won't have to be alone. I managed to finish it though, I like a challenge."
1,Do you have the time?,"I read a great deal and most all gifts to me are books. Being raised in the south, I love southern literature. This book failed to evoke any response in me except that I felt that I was wasting my time in finishing it. It was sad and hopeless, as am sure it was meant to be, but the characters were under developed and failed to connect with me on any level."
1,Boring,"I kept waitng for something to happen. I still don't understand the point of it all. If it's a love story, it's an odd one."
2,Watch your language - PLEASE......,"I LOVED Ellen Foster .... for the story and the style.... many southern people really talk like this, very real... but this one was FULL of distasteful language and the main characters made fun on Christianity a lot, which really bothered me."
2,Depressing!!!!!,"I read this book because I liked ""Ellen Foster"". Boy, was I in for a shock when I read the first couple of pages. I was instantly depressed, sad, and ready to close the book for good. Even though I finished the book, I didn't like it. I really didn't sympathize or relate to any of the characters. The story was touching and had a good plot, but I felt it could have been written better."
5,Emotionally powerful and captivating story of love,"I found this book to be one of those rare gems which made an impression on my soul; the characters were so captivating and the story was so moving that I was unable to put it down after I started it.Gibbons's characters, Jack and Ruby, come to life in this novel by sharing the story of this couple's love and devotion for each other from each of their perspectives. I was moved to tears several times while reading this book, so I suggest you keep the tissues within reach for this one."
3,Good enough,"This book did not really touch me or changed my life. But it made me realize something - When it comes to love, no matter what or how high we set our standard for the ""man of our dreams"", ultimately in the end, we will want a man who would take care of us and love us unconditionally. And surprise surprise, it may come for the most unexpected source"
2,So what?,"This is a very slight novel providing a glimpse into the lives of a few people, but no real insight into any of them. I guess the main feature is the unlikely love story between two of the protagonists. None of the characters came to life for me and ultimately the novel is totally forgettable. I was left thinking so what?"
5,This is a wonderful love story,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love how it was narrated by both of the main characters. The way it went back and forth between them made you understand how they felt about each other. Kaye Gibbons beautifully depicted a rare kind of love between a husband and wife. I cannot understand some of the low ratings I have been reading, but everyone has their opinion. I loved the characters and I highly recommend this book."
1,Huh?,"O.K. I read it, all of it. I'm still waiting for the point, because it's obvious that it wasn't written to entertain. At least, I hope not. Sheesh what a B-O-R-I-N-G read!!"
1,Time waster,"So, let's see. A virtuous woman is one who'll marry anyone who asks her to, one who'll leave considerate parents without a backward wave because a man with an attractive face suggests doing so, one who decides to take up a distasteful habit to prove she's capable of vice. Each of the characters in this one-dimensional book is either exclusively good or exclusively bad. That choice of character template is lazy and insulting to readers who're aware that humanity can't be sorted so effortlessly. This review is based on the first ten chapters of the book. I wish I'd had the good sense to quit reading beyond chapter one. This is the last book I'll select based on its inclusion in Oprah's ""list."""
1,Not in my book club...,"I found this novel to be dull and tedious, despite the fact that it should have been a quick read. While it is touching in parts, overall, I found it to be uninteresting. You can keep this book in your book club, Oprah. It is no longer in mine."
1,No motivation to read entire book!,"I found this book difficult to read. All though it did have some touching parts in it, I had no desire to pick it back up to read the ending."
1,misleading,"the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was ""so what"". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid!"
4,Wonderful - Listened to it on CD,"I listened to this book on CD - an UNabridged version. It was wonderful. Gibbons writing style is well suited to listening to the book. Tom Stechulte did an excellent job showing Jack's compassion and love for his dying wife, Ruby. Check the book on CDs out at your library and enjoy."
2,I could have passed,"I read this book after reading her other novel Ellen Foster. I liked Ellen Foster very much and I would recommend that novel, but this one I do not know. The language was difficult. Gibbon's technique of switching back and forth between Jack and Ruby was difficult to grasp. Many times, I had to re-read to understand what was going on. Basically...I did not get it. The story lack depth and completion of some loose ends. The most enjoyable parts were with Cecil and Miss Mavis. I laughed aloud during those two sections but other than that I could have passed. If I had read this one first, I do not think I would not have touched Ellen Foster, which was worth the read. I read this on the recommendation of Oprah. I know she is not the official word on what to read but I put a lot stock in what she says and this one did not cut it."
2,"Disappointing, esp for an Oprah recommend.","Certainly not terrible, but I am at a loss why Oprah picked this for her book club. Never cared too much for characters, annoying dialogue and narration, just a forgetable novel for me."
3,Can't get into the book,"I am an avid reader and love all kinds of books. I thought that since this one was listed in the ""Oprah Book Club"" that surely it must be good. I got to the third chapter and was bored. I put it down and have not been tempted to pick it back up. When they tell you on the first page that the woman you are reading about has died, it kinda puts the light out on wanting to read the book. You already know she is going to die."
1,Ho-Hum,I actually liked the idea of hearing the story from the view of both characters. I thought that was a creative idea - I just didn't like the story. It was sad - a technicolor picture of what settling looks and feels like. I am getting so tired of depressing books Oprah! Enough with the pain and suffering already! Come on! Recommend something uplifting!
1,"It was just going ""nowhere""","This book seemed to drag.. and drag.., nothing was trully happening and it just ended !!"
4,Memorable story and great writing; ending was a little disappointing,"I loved the writing and there were so many passages that I wanted to highlight. I wish the ending had stuck with Stokes' point of view; I was so invested in the story and in the chapters alternating between Ruby and Jack's perspective. When the ending switched, it felt like I took a step backward, further away from the story. Nonetheless, overall this is an emotional, memorable story that I really enjoyed."
2,Where was the virtuous woman?,"There was not a single virtuous person in this book from what I read. Jack was the closest to it and he isn't a woman. I read this book because the front had Prov 31 and I falsely assumed that the book would have a christian foundation at least. But alas, no virtuous people or woman and certainly no Christ. a shame. I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,Keep going back,"I purchased this books ages ago. I keep going back to read it from time to time. It is one of my favourite books and so well written. I do recommend it. It is sad but there are lessons to learn from ""A Virtuous Woman""."
3,"A gentle,heart-tugging love story.","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a fast read (a couple of treadmill workouts) & I was captivated by the characters.I was, however, disappointed in the final chapter. I disliked the change in perspective (the majority of the story is told in the first-person, with the chapters being told, alternatively, by husband & wife). The insights offered by the perspective of the ancillary characters in the final chapter were unnecessary. Gibbons' writing in the previous chapters had allowed me to intuitively know what they would think. I wish she had just written the final chapter from Jack's perspective! It would have been raw & powerful instead of diluted and, frankly, insulting for the reader who has grown connected to her characters.Despite my disappointment in the final chapter, I highly recommend the book!"
1,Disjointed,"Jack and Ruby love each other, although it is an odd match. Although poor, they are noble in their way.What bothered me about this book is the alternating chapters between Jack and Ruby's telling of the story. The chapters also jumped around in time. The disjointed presentation prevented me from identifying with or caring about either one of them. It's a love story and another Southern novel that emphasizes the social and economic importance of owning land. That's it - no real message and nothing new."
3,Example of really loving someone,"When I began reading this I really didnt know where the author was going with the story. But it didnt take me long to figure it out. The story is a great story of a woman that found two different kinds of love with men. Its a story of strength and was a very detailed read. I think the books answers the question, "" Is it better to love hard or to be loved hard""."
4,Love the Love Stories,"I just love beautiful love stories. A lot of the reviews say that this is ""unsentimental,"" and I think what they mean is that it isn't maudlin. It's a book full of sentiment and emotion. It's also a nice read, and I enjoy books that have a great love story in them.My book club enjoyed this one but, while we found some things to talk about, we all just kind of agreed on it and nodded a lot. Certainly nothing controversial that will keep your book club up at night.If you want to spark discussion in your book club, tryRabid: A Novelby T.k. Kenyon orGod Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everythingby Hitchens."
4,"Good book, an easy fast read.","I liked this book because it was a very simple story, but one that kept me hoping for the best for these people. It was sweet and sad at times but kept my interest until the very last page.A good story, simply stated."
2,Easy Read,"An Interesting love story between 20 year old Ruby Pitt Woodrow and 40 year old Blinking Jack Stokes. Ruby was the daughter of a prosperous family and Blinking Jack was a migrant farmer who did not have much to offer. Ruby, a beautiful young lady, and Jack, not a very attractive older man got together after the death of Ruby's abusive husband. Ruby had ran off with her first husband without the blessings of her family. The author had Ruby talking about her life in one chapter and Jack talking about his life in the next. There was not much said about Jack and Ruby's life together. I enjoyed the way the author had them switching back and forth in the different chapters."
2,Unenjoyable,"I don't know, maybe I am missing something, but it appears to me that Ruby and Jack's relationship was based on need, not love. Love is not cooking 3 months worth of meals for you spouse while you're on death's door, or missing all the house keeping someone did for you after they are gone!"
3,A thought provoking story of love and life-long commitment.,"It was interesting to ""see"" the contrasting perspectives of the main characters. The story itself was one of devotion and long-term commitment we rarely see today."
2,POOR DEAL,"I would never RECOMMEND ANYONE TO SHOP WITH AMAZON OR TARGET ONLINE EVER AGAIN.I ordered it with more than 10 days to allow for shipment and I keep getting the run around about when it will arrive!!!It was supposed to be here for a BIRTHDAY on Saturday July 26 2008!!To date I have still not received it!!This is a PISS POOR WAY TO DO BUSINESS!!!!The vendor should have ensured it was in stock and if not contacted me and refunded my funds and told me to find it elsewhere, instead they let me think it would arrive on time, then the day before I needed it they send me a message saying it will be late!!!!DON'T DEAL WITH THEM!!"
2,Not the best choice for CR-V,"This item worked once installed, but it came with no installation instructions for the CR-V. I suspect that that's because the CR-V instructions would be too involved - you have to disassemble the interior of the bottom and bottom-left part of the cargo area to get to the plug in the car's wiring harness that connects to the trailer harness. The seller's Customer Service has not responded (not yet, anyway), but I found information elsewhere on the internet that enabled me to install it, albeit with some difficulty.As I said, it works well once installed, but I'd recommend doing your research before buying instead of after, as i did."
3,Too Bad it's never up to date.,"Don't purchase if you want a current program. This program included the first few sets of cards. You can easily download updates for the gym series. But I have had the program 6 mths still no Neo series cards. I bought the program around aug 2001 and you get free updates till Dec. 2001. In about 6 mths no new updates. In other words, my program has never been up to date and won't be because I am not going to pay more for updates when the updates will probably never be reasonably up to date. Also forget customer service I sent three emails and didn't even get an automated response. The program itself works really well and has great graphics it's a shame to have wasted all the programming on an out of date program."
4,"""Ted knows very well it's *his* bedtime, too.""","A small girl is ""washed and clean and ready for bed,"" but her most important bedtime companion is missing; Ted is nowhere to be found and ""bed without Ted is not a good thing."" The little girl -- along with her menagerie of dog, cats, kittens, rabbits and mice -- begin to search for Ted. Readers lift flaps and pull tabs when opening cupboards and drawers, lifting tableclothes and moving grandpa off the couch. As with all good bedtime read-alouds, there is happy ending with everyone curled up under the covers (one final flap)."
1,Beyond silly! But cute,"Buy this book because it's arguments are so ridiculous, and it's a fun read. I did feel a bit badly for laughing, though, because the author's limited research skills are cruelly exposed here. You wonder why she even bothered."
1,A Truly Misguided Book,"This author completely overlooks the fact that the women's rights movement is about ending violence, not promoting it. It seems Stange wants us to believe that we cannot be equal to men unless we are just like them. I wanted to laugh at first, then cry. This book represents the ultimate misguided use of the term feminist."
1,woman should stay home,"I'm sorry but women dont belong in the field. I am an avide hunter and my wife was given this book by her friend. I read the first few chapters and the last one and skimmed the rest. It seems to me to be weird feminist Lorraine Bobbitt propanganda, I dont want to think of girls out there in the woods when Im withmy buddies. They would onlybe a distraction and scare the toms and cussies since they talk to much! Anyway, I highly recommend Ted Nugents books insteadof this one expecially if you want to keep the wife at home where she belongs."
4,BOUGHT THE USED,I BOUGHT THE USED ONE FOR THE PRICE AND IT STILL CAME LOOKING BRAND NEW...THE RECIPES ARE INTERESTING BUT DOESNT LOOK LIKE IT WILL TAKE 30 MIN TO COOK EM. THEY DIDNT PROMISE THAT BUT I WISH THATS HOW LONG IT TAKES.
1,"More Like ""Sword Through My Eye""!!!","Indie film or not, this is the shoddiest piece of filming I've ever seen. Very poor production values(using the term loosely). I've watched better videos on YouTube taken with people's cellphones. Filmed mostly at a Renaissance Festival site(Bristol) during off-season, they didn't even bother to remove the garbage can holders! Most of the costumes look like they were borrowed from the faire's ""Rent-A-Costume-And-Look-Authentic-While-Walking-The-Faire"" booth. English accents are non-existant, as is acting ability(not to mention intelligent plot. NO attempt at any authenticity. Swordsmanship? WHERE???OMG, please....save the $20.00 this dreadful DVD costs and go to your local Faire. At least you can be entertained all day(instead of horrified for 93 minutes), eat a turkey leg, flirt with the local ""maidens"", enjoy the hysterical swordplay of Don Juan & Miguel, the witty humor of Ded Bob and go home happy(except for the sunburn) with a bag of cinnamon almonds;o)))"
1,could'nt watch this dvd...,"extremely poor production value, dismal acting. The American accents and modern scenery were not workingfor this ""Eliazbethan "" adventure. Could only watch the first 10 minutes."
2,Product not for everyday use,"The velcro pads make the item extremely bulky along the sholders and, when you move, the Velcro makes noise. The elastic bands run too close to the neck, so it shows at the neck line of even simple t-shirts. This product is not convenient for everyday use."
5,The images just jump off the pages!,"This is a ""one of a kind"" adventure.Writings of the Mystical ages of D'ni are full of fictional adventures and are so discriptive that they put actual images in ones' mind as you are reading the books.I first encountered these places online in Myst URULIVE, the online ever-changing and world-wide computer game.I would encourage everyone to read and explore the wonderful book of MYST!Nita...member of the Guild of Greeters. Myst online."
4,"Very entertaining, even for non-Myst'ers","The books are very entertaining and easy to read. The first book starts with a bang, the relationship between the main character (Atrus) and his father Gehn are determined right from the moment he was born.After that an interesting tale is told, about the D'ni, an ancient underground culture and the descripting art of writing they developped, which makes it possible to travel to the worlds written. This is the perfect basis for endless twists and plots, and the books are over before you even realize it, making you crave for more.These are entertaining books for everybody, but for those who played any of the Myst games or Uru, they are an absolute MUST. They complement and explain the games in such a way that they enrich the games no end.The Myst Reader combines the three books in one volume. Get it now, you won't be disapointed."
4,Myst Reader,"Great to read the history of the game, as I am a fan of making of movies etc, it looks like a whole world has been created.RegardsJoyce Parratt"
4,The First Editon: Not Forgotten,"As a fan who followed the group from their first album, at ten years old, I was surprised that some great songs that developed the group early on were not included such as; ""If Wishes Were Horses"", ""I Found A Reason"", and one of the especially notable songs by Thelma Comacho ""I Get A Funny Feeling"". These early songs were a catalyst in the group's initial success with appearances on such shows as The Smothers Brothers, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour. The Ed Sullivan Show and American Bandstand. With each member's unique talent, this could have definitely been a 2 CD package. As a fan I wanted more of the memories of the original members. But for those that recall the most radio heavy aired tunes, they are included right here. I also appreciated Todd Everett's seven page history of the group's evolution and update of each band member."
2,"Why omit some of their BEST in a ""BEST OF""?","Is it lunacy or pettiness that motivates a label to fail to release one of the BEST songs of The First Edition? The group evolved into a backing band for Kenny. So what? It's a shame that many people will never hear ""I get a funny feeling."" A classic. It stands the test of time. And it ought to be in every First Edition ""best of""--it was one of their best."
3,searching...,"All of your compilation of Kenny Rogers and the first edition is marvelous, but I'm looking to one particular album tittle FOOL'S Sound tract from the movie Fool's with the best selling single "" Someone Who Cares "" & ""Anais Song "" I hope you would include this album record in your list."
4,Pickup good - preamp great!,"This thing is perfect for church (or other live venue) pianos: sounds good and is almost invisible. The pickup - if placed right (you NEED to experiment with it) - sounds great live and reduces bleed.But what is really cool is that the preamp alone is an AMAZING buffer amp for instruments with piezo pickups: upright bass, guitar, violin - anything sounds great through this because of it's wide frequency response. Great for the studio!"
2,not the lift the flap version,"This book is okay for everyday objects, dress, ball, tricycle, but not for learning colors. The name of the objects as well as the color are listed instead of focusing on the name of the color being addressed. Also some of the colors were not very well defined, for example, pink was so dark it looked almost red and the red shoes looked pink, the shade of gray used was too dark, nearly black, and too many of the objects had more than one color (ball was blue and white, coat was black and white) instead of being a solid color to go with the color that page was focusing on."
4,Good picture book,"Bright Baby Colors is a great picture book. My littles ones love it. We practice the words every night, and now they recognize the pictures and are telling us what they are instead of us having to ask them."
1,Not what I saw in the Excerpt,"When I came across the product review page, I knew it is what I wanted immediately. I loved that there were lots of different images on each color page. When I received the book, it was not that at all. Each page only has one image for each page, 2 for each of the 12 colors. I am very disappointed and will return it."
4,Great read,"Great writing, two wonderful characters and a believable plot that was well executed. Also a little bit of history thrown in which was also very well done."
1,Sucks !,"This is, without a doubt, the WORST text-book I have ever had in school ever! The examples are poorly written and all the numbers just put in the formulas right away so half of my time goes into finding out what formulas are being used, and the other half goes into reading the bad text. The problems are many with wrong given answers and well.. that is just typical because the book left me nothing. I would strongly recommend other books for subjects this book teaches."
1,Terrible Textbook,"I can't believe how badly written this textbook is. I could find countless mistakes riddled throughout the pages including: missing units, wrong units, spelling mistakes, wrong answers given. In addition, the examples do not clearly show how to go about a certain problem, nor do they explain what equations are used. This textbook should have never been published."
1,Disappointed....,"This article arrived with NO lid, 2 weeks later than expected but luckily before Christmas, and the custom fees (US to Canada : CAD 23,00) were not expected as not mentioned when the order was placed. I like the product by itself but the service around it was not good at all. If I find another website to order it from nex time, I will."
1,Be aware,"Be aware that this is an extremely short treatment of the ancient site. If you have even HEARD of Knossos, you are probably aware of all the information shared here, and you have likely seen the pictures. Even at $14.95, I think it is overpriced. Maybe it goes to a good cause, but had there been more content in this one, I would have ordered all their products; not now!"
5,LaCie Ethernet mini 500GB - Excellent product,"This is an excellent product for someone looking to centralize backups and all types of files on a home network. I have used this disk for the past year and it is excellent, We have both Windows PCs and a Mac on the network (wired and WiFi) and it works great!Just remember path names and that data transfer speeds are not that of a direct-attach drive... I am ordering more to try multiple net drives. Great product."
1,Noisy. Failed after 12 months.,Very very noisy. The fan seems to be on full at all times.The admin interface is very poor.The manual has errors. Admin is actually admin. ie case senstive.The last time I buy a LaCie.- - -March 2008 update. Drive failed.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I read Mr/Ms Sparks glowing review and felt someone needed to mention some of the ""not so good"" aspects of this device:If you are a Windows XP user and want to back up your machine, it probably wont work. FAT32 limits the size of the file to 4GB. If you think you can solve this problem by formatting it as NTFS, it wont work either.If you think its fast, it isn't! especially if you are using WiFi.As far as what is advertised, it works good, easily installed and not too noisy."
4,Isaac's second and third Polydor LPs finally on CD.,"This long-overdue and much-anticipated CD reissue of two of Isaac Hayes' albums from the late-'70s is much welcome indeed. Granted, some of the uptempo disco tracks sound dated, trite and overproduced but the gorgeous slow-burn ballads are vintage Isaac Hayes on all counts. Despite changing trends, Isaac Hayes' music remained fresh and relevant and the two LPs reissued on this CD are (mostly) very fine and soulful."
5,Pyrantel wormer,This is a good product as I have had very satisfactory results with previous use of this wormer on my hunting dogs. Product is not readily available in rural areas and the online purchase is more convenient and much more reasonably priced than buying a few pills at a time. Easy to use by mixing with feed will continue to use this product.
4,Local Flavor,"Why is it that you read to expand your knowledge and understanding of your world - including distant locales - but find comfort in reading about familiar surroundings? I guess it makes the story seem all that much more real. As someone who grew up in West Columbia, and still live close by, I found the story a light, but a very enjoyable read. It's about time someone took the eccentric south Florida type characters I've been reading about (Carl Hiassen) and moved them next door."
3,Description does not indicate actual size,"The earrings are great: cute and exactly what they said they would be. ""Problem"" is not actually with the product but with the description. No where does it tell you the actual size. The picture leads you to believe they are much bigger than they actually are (about 1/2 cm from head to tail of the turtle.)Not really a problem, the actual size just needs to be on the description somewhere."
3,"Cute, but the backs fall off.","The backs aren't easy to put on, and they come off rather easily, too."
3,Cute little earrings.,"I purchased these for my goddaughter. They are very cute, but she lost one inspite of the screw back. I'd buy them again though, when she's a little older and can hold on to her jewelry a bit better."
1,tiny tots toy turtle,"Here is an example of the deception of photos on the net. The smallest photo they showed of these earings was 4x larger than the actual product!!We had to put them on our 9 month old grandaughter, and even then they still appeared tiny on her baby ears!! Rip off, never buy jewlery from amazon again!!"
5,Cronkite is excellent,This is an excellent review of history over the course of Cronkite's life. It covers the major events with him offering personal insite and comments. I purchased it for my dad who is 81 years old. This period of history basically mirrors his life and he really enjoyed it.
2,The Cronk Conks out.,This box set was disapointing in a way that will be tediously familiar to anyone who collects documentaries-Crap video.All the more unforgivable when you consider that the ancient news footage looks better than the murky scenes of the cronkin front of the fire shot for the series.
5,Walter Cronkite Remembers,Some surprises for those who remember the great newsman. Comfortable format. Inciteful as always.
5,Tarantino has definatly outdone himself on this Soundtrack.,What a great CD!!! It's all the best songs from my favorite movies. Tarantino definatly knows how to pick 'em. It's a lot of really great music. On top of that there are interviews of the mastermind himself. If you like his movies and have all the soundtracks already it is still worth it to get this one. Not only does it make your set complete but to hear the wity scriptmaker..! If you don't have any of his soundtracks than this compilation is for you. It's all the good stuff stirred in together with a little bit of Tarantino and a lot of Sugar. It's a must get.

3,Old fashioned. At least for middle upper level English speaker,"This cassette tape is old fashioned and almost out of stock.Actually i had a chance to learn its text book at one of advanced English course several years ago.The contents of the text book and the tape is somewhat old fhashioned,The speaking speed of the tape is fast to listen for beginners and there is no repeat for the learners.I guess the expressions of this tape are formal ones to use."
2,English Learner,This book is not an informational book but is strictly activities. Not what I wanted.The condition is good and it was received on time.
3,"Blog, blog, blog!",J.A. Jance uses up too many pages with blogs! Story line is good but occupies far too many pages with blogs. Not J.A. at her best!
2,Not up to Jance's usual quality,"I have to agree with Majorca's review. Ali is to stupid to even put on the shoes let alone tie them. (By the way, I love that analogy. I plan on using it whenever I can). I usually enjoy Jance's books but this one just doesn't measure up and I doubt that I will read any more of the Ali series. I didn't even finish it, and that's rare for me. I found myself talking back to the audio version because I couldn't believe that anyone would do the stupid things she did. My next one is the Beaumont series, hopefully that is more suspenseful and entertaining."
2,A web that quickly falls apart...,"The first half was pretty good and kept me thinking, but the last half was really bad and nearly left me labotomized. I was actually angry when I finished the last words thinking ""How could it end so, so...lamely?"".This book is not a total waste of time because the ""evil"" in the title does come across, most devilishly. Although there are far better books to sink your hours in to.Sorry, JA. This read was a minor stinker."
2,Forget the blog!,"I read all of the Alison Reynolds series, and found the whole blogging part just annoying. It was like the writer was trying too hard to show she was up on the latest computer fad and was just wholly uneccessary. Same thing with Patricia Cornwell in her early Kay Scarpetta books. Most people know computers these days, we are not impressed that you do too. It's overkill."
1,What a steamer!,"Phew! Avoid this if you possibly can. Her work is generally top drawer. Not this one! Slow, non-believable characters, transparent plot, inane heroine - this one's got all the elements of a non-read. Too bad, since Jance has been one of my favorites for years. I guess everyone gets a bad write once in a while."
2,Going down hill,"This is the first J. A. Jance book I could not finish. I had read the previous Ali book, and was not too impressed, but since I have always liked J. A. Jance, I tried this one.The plot is silly and unbelievable and contrived. No one getting a divorce would hang out with the ""new"" wife like Ali did here. I find it hard to care about any of the characters. I have a 100 page rule, if I don't like a book after 100 pages I stop, but I did go past that here just because of the author. Not worth your time and far from her best work."
1,The plot is preposterous,"The author should, first of all, avoid any plot that involves legal matters. In another book, she included a private judge, without understanding how that concept works and ignorant of the differences between a private judge and a sitting judge. In this case she includes the time-honored, and non-existent ""reading of the will."" This allows her to have the wife and her intended successor in close contact in a meeting with attorneys present when, in fact, clients would never have been present at such a meeting. Although attorneys for both parties are present, the heroine is allowed to do and say stupid things, all to her detriment. In fact, throughout the book (I've only read a third of it and won't bother with the rest), she acts stupidly, all contrary to her best interests and to common sense. I can't take any more. I suggest that others not even read page one."
2,Worst Jance book I've read,"I have enjoyed Jance's books in the past, but this one made me wonder if it was the same author! I felt the protagonist, Ali, was very poorly written. She is presented as a bright, talented, ex-TV anchor--someone who should have a good head on her shoulders. Yet her actions are not those of an intelligent woman but rather those of an immature adolescent. The plot was not believable. I never felt ""inside"" this book, but always an unbelieving observer. Read the J.P. Beaumont series instead and give Ali a pass."
1,Waste of Time,"While I enjoyed the first book in this series, Web of Evil was a total waste of time. Ms. Jance takes the story out of Northern Arizona (which made the first interesting), sets this story in L.A., and then delivers a boring storyline. I will not read the third book."
5,WEB OF EVIL,"THIS BOOK LIVES UP TO IT'S PREDACESSOR AND IS A FINE, THRILLING, CANT PUT IT DOWN BOOK. MADE US GO BUY SEVERAL OLDER JANCE NOVELS WE HAD READ OVER THE SPAN OF TOO MANY BOOKS AGO! JA JANCE DELIVERS"
4,Another good mystery in series,Another great twist in Ali's life of murder and mystery. Her supportive cooking family adds to the fun and chaos
1,pathetic,"I purchased this audio cd - how does that saying go - screw me once shame on you . . . I knew I was in trouble when the reader used three different tones for Ali's mother in their (Ali's and her Mother's) first conversation. In addition, if you are going to pronounce really complicated words like bougainvillea you should look up the proper pronunciation. (This is sarcasm in case the point was missed.) This story and level of writing is so sophomoric and pathetic that by the time April and Ali are in the kitchen, I am cheering for April and the story goes downhill from there. As a fan of the early Beaumont and Brady series, (the latter stories have been horrendous) it almost makes me think someone else is now writing for her. I will never purchase another Reynolds's story or anything read by Karen Ziemba. I wish I could get a refund on this cd."
3,Not a bad story........,"......but not the best by Jance by far. I think the blogging and emails do add to the story, but this story just went on too, too long. There is one thing I really take exception to - the reference to Columbine. It had no place in this story. Comparing Ali hiding under a table to those kids hiding under tables was tacky. The kids didn't have a glock with them like Ali did. I live in Colorado. I know kids who were there. The reference to Columbine was in extremely poor taste. Shame on you, Ms. Jance."
1,Sheer Stupidity,"Ali Reynolds has to be the stupidist heroine ever created for a series. I thought Stephanie Plum was too stupid to tie her shoe laces but Ali Reynolds is too stupid to put the shoes on! She does everything she's been told not to do, goes against advice from far smarter people, and just ignors plain common sense with a self rightous attitude that no one is going to tell her what to do or not to do. Then she has the unmitigated gaul to play the ""poor me"" card when she gets in over her head - again and again and again.....And the writing was so awful I couldn't believe J. A. Jance wrote this book. The same inane information is repeated over and over as if either Jance forgot she had already told us, couldn't think af anything new to say, or thought her audience was as stupid as her character. I love the books with Sheriff Brady and Beaumont but will never force myself to read any more with Reynolds as the main character. Life's too short to read garbage."
2,Totally Disappointed,"I'm currently on Chapter 9, but I've realize from Chapter 3 or 4 that Ali is one of the DUMBEST characters in the world. Can someone please create an accused person with some COMMON SENSE? This woman just doesn't listen. How many murders do you have to be accused of to make you wake up?The character Ali is an idiot. I can't feel sorry for her when she won't even help herself. This started out good, but boy is this (or she) stupid. Women do have brains, so why wouldn't the author write a character with intelligence? Totally disappointed."
2,J.A. Jance Lite,"I won't repeat the plot. I've read all of her Joanna Brady series and most of the JP Beaumont series, and I found myself wondering where is J.A. Jance in this book? It's like this book was written by a different author altogether. This book is readable, but just barely, seems to be mostly fluff with little substance."
3,Not bad but not fantastic,"I didn't know it was part 2 of a series, but still, in my opinion a story should be able to stand on it's own. The book had a lot parts that just weren't part of the plot, nor necessary to the plot. Good, but not great, in my opinion."
3,Spider's Web,"WEB OF EVIL has Ali Reynolds witness a bad ""accident"" and being thankful she no longer has to report the news. Ali with problems of her own--pitched into a rush divorce while her husband's new squeeze is planning a wedding so her baby will be born on time in wedlock is not one's normal cup of tea. Hubby was busy because another mother and baby come to light and their son seems almost oblivious his new siblings.The trunk of the car contained Ali's ex and she becomes the chief suspect in a case of murder. Ali and all the other characters for some reason just don't make it. Ali is too ""good"" and everyone else is the pink stuff stereotypes. Not the best of J.A. Jance's continuing characters. These stories don't have the depth of the Joanna Brady series.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County Novel"
5,Tiffany Is Awesome!,"This is a wonderful collection of all of her hits. I found this at a thrift store for only $3 and I'm glad I got it.I'm a child of the 80's (born in '79),so I grew up listening to Tiffany and Debbie Gibson,but I've always liked Tiff just a tad more. (lol) If you're a fan of great 80's pop music,get this cd."
4,Tiffany - Greatest Hits CD,"CD arrived okay, plays perfect... just that the album jacket itself has no lyrics printout, so can't read along while she sings... bummer..."
3,Greatest hits,"This is not a worthy Greatest hits because this album only has five hit songs on it. The first ""I Think We're Alone Now"" and ""Could've Been"" both hit Number 1 ""I Saw him Standing There"" hit 7 ""Feelings Of Forever"" did a miserable 53 ""All This Time"" hit 6 and her last hit in 1989 was ""Radio Romance"" and it hit 35. As you see she did not have enough songs to make a greatest hits. Buy her debut album ""Tiffany"" those are all the songs you want. This is a NOT BUY."
4,"For A Better Greatest Hits, Search For ""All the Best""","This is a decent greatest hits package, but a bit disappointing if you know more about Tiffany's music. For one, ""Back in the Groove Now"" and ""Mr. Mambo"" are pretty poorly deserving of slots on this album. It might be hard to search for it as it was released only in Japan, but ""All the Best"" is an awesome greatest hits package with two great rarely heard Tiff tunes, including one she co-wrote. By the way, search ""We Will Follow"" on this site and you can find a great new Tiff cover of U2 called ""New Years' Day."" As for the disappointing Deb fan below, don't hate. If I must compare, I will say that Deb is good fun, but I do think Tiffany is more genuine and equipped with a lovelier voice. But I respect your right to disagree, of course."
4,Tiffany Was the Cutest Girl of the '80s!,"And her music wasn't bad either. I never understood why Debbie (sorry, I heard that she chops your head off if you don't say Deborah) Gibson received all of the fan worship while poor Tif was pushed into a corner (perhaps it had to do with those little ""New Kids on the Block"" freaks and their insane jealousy that she dated Jordan Knight for five minutes back then, but whatever). Her ballads are much more poetic than Debbie's and I think that her voice is quite a bit richer. ""Danny"" is a great song and worth the price of the cd, but the other songs (save for ""Radio Romance"", which even as a 11 year old girl struck me as annoying) are quite good and deserve another listen."
2,Mediocre collection,"I liked some of Tiffany's hits. But this album shows a lot of her weakest material. A few of the songs from her '88 and '90 albums lack the excitement of the selections from her '87 debut album. They're surprisingly bland. Tiffany didn't have the conviction that her rival competition, Debbie Gibson, had. I would have liked an 18-song collection to have shown her variety from the MCA albums, not this limp, mediocre, badly thrown together album from 1996. It looks nonexistent for a compilation. It's no doubt that she faded very quickly after 3 years until her 2000 album brought her back into the scene again. This album doesn't showcase her music career quite well as I would have liked it."
2,An OK CD,"Unfortunately, only 2 songs here are worth listening too... the first and last, ""I Think We're Alone Now"", and ""Could've Been"". I guess this is what happens when you don't compose your own songs like Debbie does... Kinda' a disappointment."
2,She had one good song...,"""I Think Where Alone Now"" is her only good song. The rest is teenybop filler. Her 15 minutes are long gone."
5,great sprinkler!,Great sprinkler does not miss a beat great coverage the only bad if not in grass it won't pull it self got to keep the hose length short
4,this is a great product... my yard apparently is not so great.,"The Nelson Rain Train does exactly what it says it does. Some of the functionality has been modified for the better compared to older versions that I have used. So if you are researching rain trains this one is the best and they are worth the cost. However the only con with it is my yard. I have the typical quarter acre lot with a lot of naturally curved landscaping which takes up about half of the entire yard. So not to the fault of the rain train, there ends up being a lot of tight turns with the hose which it does not handle well. I found that using a larger diameter hose or contractor grade hose helps. Also my yard is not flat. This sometimes causes the auto shutoff to engage which is annoying. But all in all if you have a basic lawn with simple landscaping, these are awesome. If your yard is anything like mine, still get it, but anticipate the need to get a little bit creative."
2,Three Months: Not much for the money.,"The Raintain Traveling Sprinkler worked great when I received it in early June. I used it a couple of times a week off and on throughout the summer, but last week it stopped working. It lasted about three months before the gears stripped out. Not a very good lifespan for the money I paid for it. Will I buy another? No. I guess I'll go back to moving my sprinkler or paying more for something that will actually last longer than 3 months. I loved how I could make it cover such large expanses of the yard by simply directing the hose where I need the sprinkler to do its work."
5,Love my traveling sprinkler,"Not cheap ($50) but works as advertised and really made well, must weigh 20lbs. The automatic turn-off is a real turn-on. There are even more expensive ones but why?"
1,VERY UPSET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this unit and payed the hefty one day expidite fee. When it arrived I was very excited until I opened the box and discovered the threaded coupling that holds the sprinkler arm on was missing. I called Nelson as instructed by the insert in the box and they told me it would take 2 weeks to get the part. I asked for a supervisor hoping she'd understand that I paid extra and needed this quickly. With NO apologies or sympathies offered for costing me extra or for the inconvience, she cooly said 2 weeks was the best they could do because they were so backed up. I guess with that type of business, losing one customer like me doesn't matter to them, so beware if you need replacment parts or your order arrives with missing parts!I am upset and disappointed with Nelson!"
5,Great product,"I love this product, but it says not to use it to water when you are seeding. Not sure why."
2,good for awhile,"I got tired of how many times this jumped the track. I believe the gears are plastic, as well, it stopped progressing along the hose. I never abused my tractor sprinkler, always putting it away (fearing theft). I ultimately bought a national walking sprinkler and added the brass arms so i would be done replacing this expensive item for once and for all. [...] That item is expensive and heavy but is all metal and does a great job."
1,Plastic gears. Not made like the old ones.,"My family had one of these for 20 years and it was awesome. I had to send mine back to Amazon after 2 weeks because the gears are now made of plastic and stripped out.The concept is great, but it just doesn't work with the cheaper materials.Also the older ones shut off with an in-line valve on the hose that the tractor ran into. This new ramp system with the button on the bottom of the tractor doesn't work. The tractor would hit the button like 80% slowing the flow enough so the spinner would stop spinning. This stopped the tractor, meaning it just sprayed the same exact patch of grass until you noticed it.Sad.Amazon gets 5 stars though for taking it back and paying return shipping on a freaking 20 pound hunk of junk."
3,Need high water pressure,"The sprinkler tracks fine and provides a decent watering pattern as it travels. However, you need significant water pressure to keep it moving. Additionally, if I use more than 100' of heavier hose, it struggles to pull it along. I suppose this would less of a problem with higher water pressure. Overall, a fine product...it just doesn't work well for me and will likely find its place on a shelf in my garage."
5,rain train,I love it! We received it very quickly and were able to save our grass from the horrific drought. Great product!
5,Effective Solution,"Every year my family goes threw at least 3 full sized sprinklers. Watering 5 acres can be a challenge, but this traveling sprinkler does the job. All you have to do is set your path, adjust the arms for water travel length , place automatic shut-off ramp and let it roll.I've used 100 ft. of hose and never had any pressure problems with this sprinkler. Most of the larger sprinklers will loose their stride at this length , but the Raintrain put all of my worries to rest.Quality product."
4,Need help,"I have a older model of this product,that I have used for 30+ yrs.,but now needs a part ,and I am trying to get. I would like some help in where to find it . Thank You. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH PRODUCT."
3,Now made in China,"I used one of these my parents had last fall to establish my new grass. It worked great but I am almost sure it had an American flag that said ""made in America"". So I bought one , but my new one says Made in China. I was disappointed. Also, when I told my father I bought one he told me he had bought two -- the first one's gears were stripped."
3,NELSON TRAVELING SPRINKLER,THE SPRINKLER COVERS A GOOD AREA BUT DOES NOT DO WELL ON EVEN SMALL INCLINES OR UP HILL IT JUMPS THE HOSE AND WONDERS THE YARD AND CAN WIND UP IN NEIGHBORS YARD OR UP AGAINST A TREE AND STRIP THE GEARS AND IT WILL NOT TRAVEL ANY MORE YOU NEED TO WATCH IT CLOSELYBUT IF YOU USE IT ON STRAIGHT FLAT AND NOT TO MANY CURVES IT PERFORMS WELLIT IS ALSO VERY HEAVY SO IF YOU HAVE A BACK PROBLEM I'D PASS ON THIS KIND OF SPRINKLER LOTS OF BENDING AND RELOCATING ITI GOT THEM BECAUSE I HAD INSTALLED NEW SOD AND HAD TO WATER EVERY DAY FOR 2 WEEKS I HAD NO SPRINKLING SYSTEM AND IT SERVED ITS PURPOSE .L BARNARD
4,Rain Train,"The Rain Train works great on established grass. It doesn't work on new seeding, but the manual tells you that. Great product. If only it could start up and reverse course the next day."
1,Not as good as your neighbor's,"I bought this Nelson Raintrain after borrowing a neighbor's for several months. I thought I knew it would work for my lawn, since my neighbor's sprinkler worked for my lawn. I was wrong. There are apparently several design changes, but most importantly, this one will not stay on its track the way the neighbor's does. If I walk away for 15 minutes, I come back to find it happily digging holes a few feet away from the hose track. The only way I would recommend buying this sprinkler is if you can go back in time and buy one when my neighbors did."
2,would not order again,"was so excited about this product that I ordered 3. Within a month on one and 3 months on another the gears stripped and would not move ""walk"" again. Very disappointed at the gears were plastic and not very good plastic at that! Would not recommend this to anyone!"
5,"Works excellent, even on irregular pattern of lawn.","Love this little traveling sprinkler. I can set it up in seconds and then relax while it waters my weird shaped lawn. I don't have a sprinkling system, so this little traveler gets all parts of the lawn and stops by itself on the little attachment. My neighbors want to know where to purchase one for them."
5,Excellent purchase,"We love our Raintrain. It is very sturdy and I'm sure will last for years. We have a large yard, so we don't even put it on a ""track"". We just turn it on and let it go. No more moving sprinklers!!!"
5,Great Sprinkler- gets the job done,Works very well. Can run water for hours with this sprinkler. I've been very pleased
5,Luv it!,"It does take some time getting used to setting up the sprinkler, but after a couple of times, I know the drill. Had a problem with one of the arms, and emailed Nelson regarding same. They were quick and courteous regarding replacing the part. Since water restrictions are looming in South Texas, plan on getting a lot of use out of this handy gadget."
2,Yuck on Raintrain,I have used these sprinklers for quite a few years but have struggled with removing the axle caps for the last time to change out the housing. The screw drive seems to be very inferior to what they once were. If you miss catching the sprinkler when it doesn't make a curve and it runs against an obstacle it is mostly shot.Too bad Nelson don't make the gears as solid as the body itself. Might cost more but would be worth it. I am going to buy the all metal traveling sprinkler next.
4,Tractor sprinkler,"This unit works great as a sprinkler, but at the end of the cycle it won't shut off. When it comes to the end of the cycle where I set the plastic shut-off hump, it only shuts off part way. The shut-off valve is defective. The tractor comes to the shut-off hump and sits on top of it digging holes in the lawn with its rear wheels. I've tried to close the shut-off valve by hand, but it doesn't work, so I just have to watch it when it gets close to the end."
4,Nelson 1875 Traveling Sprinkler,Well made quality product. Appears to be constructed to last many years. Saves me a LOT of sprinkler changes!
3,"Great invention, poorly built.","This would be a 5-star item except that Nelson apparently likes to make money by selling replacement gear boxes. The gears are made of cheap plastic that won't even last one season, for me. I've examined the broken gear boxes; the broken gear is always the same one. Seems like Nelson could greatly improve the reliability of the unit without significantly affecting the cost if one or two of the plastic gears were replaced with brass or stainless-steel."
2,Much too slow for large yards.,"The throughput is too low. I have a metered water timer. When I set the time to 2 hours using a oscillating or pulsating sprinkler, it takes 2 hours. With this Rain Train set to 2 hours it takes 4 1/2 hours to apply the same amount of water. It takes twice as long to water the same amount of grass. The other problem I've noticed is that yellow stopper device that turns off the rain train doesn't work. The tractor sits too deep in the grass and catches the bottom side of the stopper. I have not been able to get this thing to stop yet. The tractor turns well until it is dragging a lot of hose behind it, then it tends to go off track(hose) more easily.Where I have found good use for this sprinkler is my side and front yard. For small areas, the rain train is ideal. You can set the sprinkler to water an area as small as 15 ft and up to 55 ft. Of course, the bigger the area, the less water that gets applied per application."
1,Bad nylon gears,"I sent an inquiry a few days ago to the company, and have not received a response. I bought a Raintrain from Do It Best in Champaign. It worked for a week, then ran over the stop block and stopped at a rock and kept running. Now it will barely move, and there is a clicking sound when it attempts to move. I assume a nylon gear was stripped when the stop ramp did not work. I want a replacement. I'm waiting for their response after a second inquiry today."
4,Great product.,"My lawn is very tiny, it's not even really a lawn, it is similar to the strip of grass on the side walk. I have both the sidewalk grass and the similar strip in front of my house. It is long and narrow. I couldn't really use a sprinkler because of the shape so I got this thing and it works great. The strip of grass in front and along the side of my house is sloped so it fell over once. After that I just put it at the edge of the side walk and my grass and it waters both my grass and the sidewalk grass strip at the same time. If you can't afford a sprinkler system this is the next best thing. My neighbors did laugh at it though but I don't care, they don't even have a lawn because they live in a middle unit townhouse. So I get the last laugh. =) I definitely recommend it for any lawn as long as it isn't too hilly, I think it can climb a hill but not walk along it because it will just roll like mine did."
5,Yard Slve,I'vd had this sprinkler for 30/60 days. My back yard is more than a quarter acre and I have attached a 150 ft of hose in a semi cicle and at a slow speed. It does a great job. The temp today was 103.4. I had a very old similar iron type purchased in 1966. I prefer the current purchase because of the water turn off devise. It works great. This sprinkler is a well designed product that works as represented.
4,"Why are the ""important"" parts plastic?","I bought this sprinkler two years ago. It is now broken too badly to be repaired. The casing is a nice, heavy steel. Unfortunately, the parts that move are plastic and break over time. The knob at the bottom that shuts the sprinkler off broke last year. Now, the hose fitting is cracked too badly to use. I will buy another one since I don't know of anything better."
1,Parched Prairie in Pennsylvania,"Ordered a month ago. Received with a part missing. Returned unit and still waiting for a replacement. No money no product. Still waiting for a response to email. The vendor seems to have a good bit of negative feedbackthat should have cautioned me. When these sort of things happen, I without business (Amazon) until the matter is resolved."
5,Terrific and easy to use,"My husband loves the rain train. It waters our yard so well, and we live in Houston, TX, so it gets hot here, and we have lots of yard and landscaping. The rain train is easy to use, and we still have a 20 year old rain train from his parents that won't stop. This is a high quality product."
5,"""This Is Not a Toy""","I have used two Raintrains to water my lawn (one for front yard & one for back) for the last 15-20 years. My lawn is not smooth and flat either. They will tip over on a very steep sideslope. One of them finally quit a few weeks ago (I think a tooth broke on one of the gears.) I immediately ordered a new one and so far it works great, just like the old one."
4,Traveling Sprinkler,"Recieved very quickly just what was described. One small piece was broken when we opened the box, Nelson quickly sent a replacement at no charge. Does just what the description says, my yard looks much better."
3,What I expected,"It does its job. I have to split my 75' X 100' yard into two parts. I need to keep an eye on it to make sure that it doesn't jump off track.What I like about it is because it travels and does not shoot the water high into the air it is the best way to water my lawn evenly, which is something that other sprinklers haven't been able to do."
4,Lawn Watering Device,This Rain Train works great when you have windy weather as you can adjusdt the arms to water lower and not the AIR.. It does help if you can keep it on the hose. Needs a large curve to remain over the hose.
2,Not for new lawns being seeded,"I tried to use this on my brand new lawn which was seeded (i.e., not sodded). This was a bad idea and did not work. As soon as the ground beneath the Rain Train was damp, the front wheels started to sink into the ground. Before long, it stopped moving forward and the front wheels were completely sunk in.Because this thing is pretty heavy and the front wheels are very narrow, I cannot imagine this being usable for new seed-based lawns. Maybe it would work fine with sod.I will clean the mud off and store it in my garage until I have grass and try again and update my rating (probably next spring). Back to pulsating rotary sprinklers! I'm trying my luck with this one:Gilmour Extra Large Coverage Sprinkler #999ZS"
1,Faulty Sprinkler,"I received my sprinklers on time but they both broke with in 3 days. They ran off the side of the shutoff pad and stripped gears. Will send them back to factory soon. This makes 4 and 5 of this type of sprinkler I have purchased over the past 21 years and have had great sucess with them on the past, did not have plastic gears in the motor. Very dissatisfied."
5,Nelson Tractor Sprinkler,excellent product. I prefer it over the John Deer Tractor Sprinkler because it is much more convenient to carry.
5,We love this!,"I purchased this for my husband. We live in the sticks and pump our water from the creek to keep the grass nice. I was a little concerned the water pressure wouldn't work with this but it's been GREAT! My husband loves his new 'toy' and it's really worked out wonderful. We can run 3 separate hoses off our pump and this STILL runs great. I'm now considering getting a couple more because I think it's silly to spend half your day moving sprinklers in this huge yard. This has saved some time but I'm looking to save even more. This sprinkler is a great, fun way to save time and energy. Set-up is easy and reliable. Thanks!"
5,A great product for a specific need,"I've owned one for many years which simply wore out and the plastic began to biograde so wanted a replacement which I bought recently. Except for the automatic shut-off it was the same type and I hope will last as long as the previous. If it fits your needs, go for it."
4,Traveling Sprinkler,This sprinkler works great. A bit heavy but it should last. It looks to be repairable. I don't expect to have to do that any time soon.
3,very easy to manage,"This is a great sprinkler if you're just needing to put a small amount of water down. The most it can put down in one pass is 1/2"" of water. It is typically better to water deeply vs. just get the top part of the soil wet, which this seems to do. My grass is very thick, so it takes more water to get down to the roots, but when it gets down there, it stays for awhile, because the soil is clay, and the grass is thick. It takes a certain amount of water to get the grass blades saturated enough to let the water begin soaking into the ground. When I only have a 1/2"" of water to work with each time, it doesn't seem to get much into the soil, promoting a shallow root system.Other then that, this sprinkler is very easy to use. It's not very precise, but that didn't bother me much at all because I have a large lawn. Nelson's customer service is outstanding! They replaced the entire gear mechanism on it with only spending a few minutes on the phone."
1,Too bad they cheapened a good thing,"We've had a Nelson Rain Train for years. Each one lasted for years. We are on our third one. The others worked like a charm. The front wheels were heavy metal as were all working parts. Now we have purchased a real pain. It's hard to believe they could cheapen it so badly. We never know whether it is on or off since it will turn itself off for a blade of grass. It doesn't stay on track so we never know where it might have transported itself. We can't leave it alone for a minute. Now, after reading some reviews, we understand it might strip its gears at any point. Should have read the reviews before we bought but thought we were getting the previous quality."
1,Not good for a new yard...It gets STUCK!!!,Theory is great....practicality and reality are not! I built a new house so my yard has been tilled and I planted new seed. The problem that I experienced is the raintrain gets STUCK. What happens is the raintrain waters in a circular pattern but when it travels to where it has already watered it gets stuck. It looks like they would have designed it to only water behind the raintrain. It may work better on an already established lawn but I do not recommend this product if you are wanting to water a new lawn.
1,don't waste your money,"i'd have given it 0 stars if i could. the gears are made out of plastic, and are prone to stripping if the tractor is not used in optimal conditions. i broke mine 3 times (returned each time) when it would get stuck in the mud, against a small rock or something similar. when used in optimal conditions, this item works, but i'd recommend getting a rittenhouse instead"
1,better as an anchor,"I have had this sprinkler for 2 years or so. I find it agravating as heck. I cannot leave if it is on. The ground needs to be flat and hard for it to traverse, or it will sink in soft, or muddy dirt, or just get stuck. The sprinkling effect only covers the outer radius of a circle, rather than the whole area of said circle. I am looking for a better unit. 1-star is the lowest they had to choose from."
2,Great idea but doesn't get the job done,"I bought this sprinkler to deal with a newly seeded lawn that I needed to water daily. I liked the idea that this sprinkler can move through a relatively large area unattended. I dislike this sprinkler because it ""jumps"" the hose regularly (even though it is laid straight, nothing in the way), it's gears on high-gear stripped after half a season and finally it's just slow to cover the area it is trying to cover - my old sprinkler (back and forth fan style) put just as much water down in less time so even though I would have had to move it a few times - at least I could water the lawn in an evening. I haven't dumped it (yet)- but it's not worth the money..."
5,Easy watering for large areas,"Sprinkler worked well for watering large areas. Does not work so well when the lawn is brand new and the grass has not yet germinated. Overall, it was worth the money."
4,Very sturdy built,"Got the tractor today, but will not be able to write a review about its use. We have been receiving ample amounts of rain since I ordered it (of course)! But it is VERY heavy and seems like it will hold its own and my husband loves it as it was his early father's day present request so we will see what comes of it. I will update it when we use it. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars"
5,Best sprinkler on the market,"I had a friend recommend this product and I was a little skeptical to spend almost $50 for a sprinkler. After getting it, I have to say this is the best sprinkler on the market. It's not as easy as having an automated sprinkler system, but it's a heck of a lot cheaper and takes almost no effort to set up and let it run. The one thing to be careful of is having too sharp of bends for it to go around...then it jumps the hose and you have no idea where it's headed. If you want a sprinkler and don't want to be outside moving it every 20 minutes, check this one out."
1,Quality Downhill,"I recently purchased my second ""Raintrain"" sprinkler and sadly, it's already kaput. My first one lasted over 8 years. While the metal body is designed to last forever, the important parts of this sprinkler are now made of plastic. After only a few short weeks, my new sprinkler's gears are already stripped and it doesn't move. It only sits there clicking. click....click...click...Save your money. It takes a serious sprinkler to be worth $60. This one no longer cuts the mustard."
4,The Raintrain,"This does a good job on fairly level areas. I have trouble with getting it to turn. Must be a large radius turn to keep from jumping the hose. It is nice not to have to go out and change the sprinkler postion every hour. Have only used it a few times, so I'm still learning the in and outs."
2,This ole tractor ain't what it used to be.,"Now on my third Nelson Traveling Sprinkler that has busted down during its second use. Seems like something is wrong in the gear box as it attempts to move forward, but just clicks and bounces back. And yes, the spray arms are aimed correctly. The first two were exchanged because the cheap plastic black tee connector cracked and leaked after there first use. One would think a brass tee would apply here. Not knowing how well this product was made in the past, but today Traveling Sprinkler seems to have cut corners in quality."
4,Saves me the trouble of moving the sprinkler.,This works as I expected it would. Yes there are plastic parts and if you don't use with care you can break it. But I have seen people break the strongest things because they do not know how to care for them. This covers my 80 foot long path without any trouble and water coverage is very good even on low. I do wish I still had the one we had 50 years ago.
4,Sprinkler,"When the product arrived, it was broken. One of the lugs on the wheel was broken. I had to contact the manufacturer for new lugs - - It took a week and half before I received them. I wasn't real thrilled about that."
4,A great investment! Set it and forget it!,"This is my 2nd purchase of a Traveling Sprinkler. The first one broke by dropping it. I can tell you that the most affordable rate for this is somewhere around $70.00. I see that other websites sell them for much more, up to $130.00. This tractor is a great investment, just make sure you purchase a good garden hose, set it on low and use the stop ramp."
5,worry free traveling sprinkler,"You can turn on this little train sprinkler, let it run and forget about it. It stops on its own where you have set it to stop, no wasting water. You can make it water far and wide or only a narrow space by adjusting the water pressure. It does a far better and carefree job than any of the others sprinlers we have used over the years. Well worth the money!"
4,Great Time Saver,"Sprinkler works great and is a super time saver. Couple it with an automatic timer and you're ready to go.Downside: Being on a private well with varying water pressure, the sprinkler, even at ""High Speed"", takes quite a while to traverse the lawn. I have it setup to do a run of approximately 100' which will cover about a 140' section of lawn at a width of 40' takes about 4 hour's. Much slower than advertised.Note, the wider the path, the slower it moves as the sprikler is driven by the water spraying from the arms.Overall I do recommend this product and with the free shipping from Amazon it arrived in 4 days."
1,Final Call Auction Purchase of Traveling Tractor Sprinkler,"What I got was not what I ordered. Several pieces in this item were broken. According to First Call, the item was ""used, in good condition."" Gave false info, and will not try to rectify this situation. Buyers beware!"
1,worst sprinkler ever,"what a colossal loser this was. i have a level front yard. i set it up right, all i asked it to do was follow the freaking hose line like it was supposed to. this POS rain train never left the station. it traveled a mighty 3 feet before promptly flopping over and fixing one wand of spray on my open study window. repeated attempts with different hoses in different areas (with windows now shut) were met with equal failure.i'd rather stand in the yard and take 8 hours and hand water it than use this loser again. my grandfather warned me not to get this and he was right. sounds great in theory, works like !@#$T^!@# in reality.the only joy i got out of this thing was after 2 months when i couldn't take it anymore and heaved it as high as I could in the street and let it come crashing down until it was destroyed. i couldn't bear to foist it off as a freebie to one of my neighbors or even my worst enemy."
5,A Really Cool Way to Water Your Lawn,"We have a large lawn with no sprinklers and a well fed water system. After a quote for $8000 for in-ground sprinklers with the associated hassles, I stumbled upon this jewel of a way to water the lawn without installing a sprinkler system that would require maintenance and preparation each fall for the freeze of the New England.Dragging 100 feet of heavy rubber hose behind it, this little beauty had NO ISSUE across slightly upward sloping terrain. Throwing the water across a wide span of lawn.Upon reaching the stop, the sprinkler turned itself off without issue.I recommend this product highly."
5,Great for lawn renovation.,"This sprinkler was the best solution for my need to frequently water a newly-seeded lawn. It waters a 50+ ft. wide path where you lay out your hose. The only limit is how much hose it can drag behind it. When it reaches that limit, the wheels just dig into the dirt and the heavy sprinkler eventually shuts off it's water valve on the bottom."
3,Made in China!,I would not a purchased it had I known it was Made in China; the longstanding Nelson name gave me a false sense of 'american' pride that they would've kept the jobs here.I will no longer buy any Nelson product unless I know it's been made elsewhere from China/Asia.
5,Nelson Traveling Sprinkler,The Nelson Traveling Sprinkler works well and is easy to set up on odd shaped lawns. Both my wife and I used it to water our new grass.
3,Made in China,"Mine arrived flat not round. Im hopeing they shrink down properly and give a good seal, the price is good."
3,I never received this item,"This purchase was the first major screw up that has happened to me while using Amazon.com.I ordered heat shrink tubing but I received an inflatable boat fender instead.I know it sounds crazy but it is true.The UPS man had to use a dolly to bring it to my door. All the time I am looking at this giant box I am saying, ""What in the world could this be?""It was so crazy and funny that there was no way that I was going to send it back.Since I do not have a boat or a friend with a boat I have no practical use for the item except as a conversation piece.So a week or two after my experience I see someone making the news where they received an assault rifle after ordering a computer monitor.Anyway... It was worth a laugh or twelve."
4,Fabulous for a first record!,"If this is the first album you pick to listen to Evergrey, well you will fall inlove with it, but after you realise what great musicians they are having progressed better and better after every last album, you might say this is not the ""greatest"" record for them, but surely one that can be used as a first record or origin of a starting band."
3,Evergrey's First,"This was actually the first album that Evergrey made, but due to problems with their original label, it was not released in the US until 2003. The songs haven't been remastered, which would have been nice since the production is so poor and raw. For those of you who like that, this might not be a problem. But with the production, it is nearly impossible to discern the riffs; the crunchy guitars sound exactly the same; just a pounding noise. The guitar solos are few and unremarkable. Even a guest solo by the fantastic Andy LaRocque is unmemorable, partially because there are backing vocals, which cover up the sound of the lead guitar. That being said, ""December 26"" and the title track are excellent cuts. If you are not bothered by poor production, or if you are a diehard fan of Evergrey, you should definitely pick this up.P.S. The bonus video on my CD is inaccessible. I'm not sure if it is like this on all of the special editions or just mine."
4,"""We have no blindfolds senor, we are a poor country.""","The original 1979 version of The In-Laws is certainly showing its age, not least in the relatively low laugh-ratio in the first half. But there's still much to enjoy in this odd couple comedy where a hapless dentist finds himself wondering whether his prospective addition to the family's father is an out-of-his-tree fantasist or really is a CIA superspy, especially once Richard Libertini's insane South American dictator turns up, while James Hong's aircraft safety lecture in Mandarin is worth the price of admission on its own. Alan Akin and Peter Falk play off each other so well that it's a real shame that their only other starring partnership, the problem-plagued Big Trouble (1986) is so very poor that they never got re-teamed again.The only extra is the trailer."
1,Horrible!,"I like Peter Falk, but this is the absolutely WORST movie I have ever seen in my life. My husband agrees. They say it's zany and hilarious, but it is NOT. Terrible acting, terrible screenplay. We were duped, as we love the 2003 The In-Laws with Michael Douglas. Thought that it should be at least a little funny, being the original. Ugh. Don't buy."
4,"Not ""great"", but VERY funny","This is a little-known, but hilarious comedy. Sheldon Cornpett (Arkin) is taken on a terrifying, exciting, and fun ride by his future in-law Vince Ricardo (Falk). You don't know until the end whether Vince really is with the CIA or whether he is a total loon."
3,Clean Buddy Movie Comedy,"This is one of the classic buddy movies of its kind. The humor and satire are funny and insightful. There is no vulgarity so you can have teenagers watch this movie. This version is much better than the Michael Douglas remake by the same title. Alan Arkin is a consumate actor who displays a surban dentist in over his head. And Peter Falk is hilarious as the CIA spy or not. Alan Arkin does a great job stealing the movie as he does in many of his movies. See Alan Arkin in the movie Poppi, a tear jerker comedy with the most adorable kids."
5,Buy the 2-disk version-lots cheaper than this one. Original is Great!,"The original (Peter Falk) is one of my favorite movies. That said, at the time I am posting, it's $48 for USED??? Unbelievable. So...if you want to enjoy the new one, get the double feature...it's around $4-$5The In-Laws (1979) / The In-Laws (2003) (Double Feature)instead of this stupid price. For that, you get both the HORRID new version with that idiot Albert Brooks doing a seriously miserable job with this movie along with the original version with Alan Arkin and Peter Faulk. Just burn the remake version if you don't want to see it...you'll be doing yourself a favor."
5,"""The next time we're in Tijata, Shel ...""","Perhaps one of the best comedic movies of all time. A classic, without a doubt. As I watched this film for the ump-teenth time recently, I am still amazed at all of the funny lines and scenes. I actually thought the script was 50% improvisation given how well Falk and Arkin interact on camera. They make it look so natural and effortless. Richard Libertini is a south-of-the-border cliche of cliches, and he is brilliant at it! What more can be said about the movie that hasn't already been said? Heaps of praise from this reviewer. As for the DVD itself, the only addition is a commentary, which was nice, given that it was Arkin, Falk, the director and the screenplay writer. Unfortunately they got off track so much in their own conversations vs. what is being shown on the screen that you've heard the whole serpentine bit 5 minutes into the film, and other things like that. But still worth the price! No remake could ever do this screwball comedy justice."
4,A fine comic romp,"Three reasons to watch this movie:first,Andrew Bergman's screenplay,which contains some inspired lines (and,by the way,Bergman's book,We're in the Money,is well worth reading);second,Peter Falk,close to the top of his form;and,third and most important,Alan Arkin,who gives the kind of performance that should be studied by any prospective - and established - comic actor - in every frame,in every scene,as close to faultless as you will get (watch,especially,the early scenes,such as at the dining table,to see how beautifully judged every glance and sound of Arkin's is - wonderful,wonderful acting)."
4,The original is usually best,"This has long been one of my favorite comedies. The premise alone is interesting and the chemistry between Mr. Arkin and Mr. Falk was a joy to watch. The situations these guys get into and out of are absolutely hilarious and classic. The ""remake"" can't even come close to the original. It's too bad the movie channels don't show this version anymore. Just remember to serpentine!"
4,"Great buddy movie, sort of","Peter Falk and Alan Arkin are awesome together! They play In-Laws to be. Shortly after their first meeting Peter Falk , who plays a mystereous secret agent, visits Alan Arkin, who plays a dentist, and asks for his help. By helping him, Alan Arkin is thrown into a series of dangerous and hilarious situations. The way these two play off of each other is fantastic. I absolutely loved this movie, so much so that I refuse to see the remake."
5,Far Superior to the Remake,"The 1979 version of The In-Laws is so much better than the pathetic remake of a few years ago, its not even funny.What made the original so great was the screenplay by Andrew Bergman who also wrote the scripts for Blazing Saddles, Fletch and The Freshman. Bergman's script was finely tuned to the personas of Alan Arkin and Peter Falk to a degree that few screeenplays nowadays are. Falk's character was written as a dishonest version of Lieutenant Columbo that added to the fun. Perhaps no other film could take such an ungainly phrase as ""serpentine, Shelly, serpentine"" and provoke so much laughter with it.Add in the on-screen chemistry of Arkin and Falk and you have yourself a comedic winner."
4,The In-Laws,"This is my favorite comedy. Peter Falk is great in it. I have seen this movie about 5 times, and every time I see it I crack up laughing at the scene with the car chase on the highway. The airplane scene was also very funny. I am laughing right now just thinking about it."
4,Loved This Movie,I love these types of movies and recommend this movie to anyone that loves these types of movies too. Well acted...highly recommend.
5,Excellent Refference materials,"This book contains ewverything you need to know about setting up SAP's ESS in the Workplace. It is an invaluable reference not only for ESS, but for the mySAP Workplace as well."
2,overpriced,"The tea is fine. However, I discovered Fairway Markets in NY sells this tea for $6.49 a box - same exact size and package - and not on sale. While I understand prices vary, this amounts to a 50% difference in the price and strikes me as over the top."
5,A true rarity...,"The former 'mini-diva' prodigy of the late 80's continues impeccably her solitary,consistent,faultless and yet always original journey and her foray into the mainstream with this set of strikingly beautiful contemporary Soul/Jazz tunes.They span radio-friendly sing-a-longs ('Oooh Boy','From now on','Johnny's back'),jazz ('Take my time'),R&B; ('Don't wanna go home'),and heartfelt ballads ('Someone who needs me','You said,'Let me hold you').This is a polished and assured album that places Regina in the same league as Celine Dion and Diana Krall,notwithstanding their respective,different styles.I give it five stars,but I am totally convinced that she can domuch better."
5,Natural born Soul/Jazz vocalist who can sing DOW and NASDAQ!,"With her fabulous voice and gorgeous soul,Regina can really sing EVERYTHING,even the Dow Jones and Nasdak ...quotes( if they say that Luther Vandross can sing the telephone book...) !She is a fantastic,versatile singer who is as comfortable with jazz as she is with the best contemporary Rhythm and Blues.""This is Regina"" is a well-assembled collection of stylish,sophisticated, smooth jazz & vocals that will please fansof the genre and of Regina.The overwhelming mood is that one of passion/seduction - a soft,subtle musical enticement that's unassuming but powerful..."
5,"""Baby come to me"",Grammy come to me !!!...Seductive ballads.","We all know that nowadays,practically,any awards ceremony honours monotony,sameness and...chart success...leaving out of consideration skills,imagination,style,substance,passion,honesty and invention..(by the way,will an original,exciting,non-huge,class act EVER win something?)......Now,if you are looking for a R&B;/AC album with something undeniably unusual,new and soulfully fresh,and out of the noisy,annoying gangsta garbage or the...""sister-brotha""Nu Soul cliches,then get this one:it will vary your CDs collection,plus you'll never stop playing it.""This is Regina"" is a... shiver of delight!Yes,the charming ""CULT"",classy Grammy winner CAN sing!And can write her lovely songs as well!Favourite tracks:""Take my time"",""From now on"",""Oooh boy"",""Johnny's back"",""Don't wanna go home"".Enjoy it,as I am enjoying it now!Please,Regina,come to UK!We'd like to ""enjoy"" you in concert as well!!"
4,"Is Belle the reincarnation of 'Lady Day' ? Most likely,YES !","Why do record companies put so much of their money and energyinto creating acts that are hugely,but only very briefly, successful?Sooner or later the record idustry will have to throw out its current business model,because listeners are more and more aware of the quality of CDs that they may or want to buy.Just let's think about this fantastic vocalist,at the peak of her splendour and artistic maturity.To date,as for as Ms.Belle's music is concened,nothing has changed.Her style,her range,her class : the modern reincarnation of Billie Holiday.She sings,they listen and nothing else matters but the music.The healing touch will always be there...This CD is not a masterpiece,but yet a sample of a class act,which remains untouched by the highest and greatest accolades."
4,Elle est tres chic...,"Technically,you can't fault Regina Belle's voice,and she's brought in some of the best and most serious R&B; producers.The standout tracks are hook-laden enough,like the catty 'Don't want go home' and the smooth 'Let me hold you'.When she sticks to her strenghts,like on the soulful 'Oooh Boy' and 'Johnny's back ,Regina seems a lot more genuine.This new album,which is still making the tour of all countries in Europe, is a fusion of Regina's blissful vocals , her innate skills and ' classe a vendre '....class for sale !Recommended to music lovers who know...Now,just one silly question to her label managers : why are theyso late in releasing a remixes album or just a new one by this excellent artist?Are they aware of the potentials of their...remarkable gold mine?"
2,Too much Hip-Hop,I was mislead by another review calling this album straight R&B. It really pales compared to Regina's debut album. Where did all the real R&B go?
3,Not Regina's best work,"I love Regina Belle, but comparing Lazy Afternoon (#3), Believe In Me (#2), Stay With Me (#4), All By Myself (#5), Reaching Back (#1) and Passion (#6) to this CD, it would have to rank Believe in Me (#7) last on the list. Her vocals are strong but the material are predictable boring R&B; tunes. This is the only one of her CDs that is not on heavy rotation on my CD player or computer.I am such a huge fan of Regina and I cannot wait for the followup to Lazy Afternoon."
2,Did not move me!,"Girfriend has a great voice and it's great to hear her moving onbut... nothing stuck with me. The melodies are just okay. Iwant stunning. Oh well, you can't win them all."
5,REGINA (from Latin='Queen') in name and in fact.,"The soaring beauty of the human voice finds its most articulate expression in this collection of songs impeccably performed by maybe the true,last DIVA of Soul/Jazz.The album is a fusion of contemporary R'n'B,Soul and jazz with an incredibly emotional depth.She sounds gorgeous as always,and shows the the potential to overtake all the other post-Patti Austin/Anita Baker soul/jazz vocalists. This is an album that can be appreciated on two levels:not just the radio-friendly melodies but also the sophisticated accompaniment.Just to name some tracks :""You said"",""Take my time"",""Johnny's back""...so nice!"
4,"It's not her best,yet she is the BEST !","This CD will put you in a very,very good mood - guaranteed !No one should miss it !It's a collection of twelve beautiful,heartfelt,soulful,jazzy tunes which will be the perfect soundtrack for a perfect day.The versatility,class and spirit of this fabulous chanteuse,the distinctive sounds of the musicians and her sublime voice are totally intriguing...as always !I hope that next time she will be allowed to choose a better material,working together with her label mates such as Eric Marienthal,Russ Freeman,Miki Howard,Phil Perry...Anyway,this is the album for a good start of the New Year 2004 !"
4,She has won my heart !,"It's true that the material is not nearly as adventurous as that revered in her earlier recordings!And yet, Regina has been terrifically consistent in this offering with very inspired performances.Her sublime voice is an instrument,an emotional flow that reaches the ears and the hearts of the listeners.Highly regarded by Soul/Jazz cultists,this time she has not been helped by a grade-A stuff.On subsequent listens,the album grows on you and she captures you totally,as usual.I am waiting for her next CD with more Jazz or Jazz covers.Definitely she is one of the best around.Period."
4,Jazz ! Jazz ! Jazz ! MORE JAZZ !,"Belle has always had a great voice and surrounded herself with the songs and instrumentalists to make it sound even better.On ""This is Regina"" her choice of material has not been as canny as in the past, even if she always displays impeccable taste and her remarkable gift for phrasing.If we can speak about a complaint,it's simply the lack of more jazz or jazzy tunes or covers.And it's clear to everybody that she is a natural born jazz vocalist.With a voice as beautiful as hers,the big book of jazz would have one of its brightest superstars."
4,A Soul/Jazz gem.,"I stumbled across ""This is Regina"" quite by accident in my local store(I liked the front picture !) and decided to take a chance.... and I'm glad I did.It's perfect to relax to,it is an 'escape'album,her vocals just wash over you..I never knew Regina Belle could be so sexy! Well, the front cover promised something like that !The arrangements are simple and uncomplicated,which makes it all the better and you're able to appreciate her prodigious vocals,which are far more powerful and stylish than Natalie Cole,Celine Dion and Diana Krall...Wonderful,I love it...More,please !!"
5,Regina's latest album is one to savour...,"'This is Regina' has truly beautiful ballads,slick arrangements and soaring hooks that will entertain anyone taking time out to listen.The powerful and enchanting superstar will always be the Princess of Soul,but all the songs on this albun show so much depth and passion,delivering a unique,stylish jazz appeal to the pop/R&B; world, that's difficult to classify.One thing is for sure : this CD exudes laid-back cool and is a soulfilled classic."
1,This book is a bad nightmare...,"This book is absolutely the worst technical book I have ever read. Too many typos to recollect. They rushed this book to press to make a buck - I paid the price in $ and misery wading through all of its errors. What was really bad was all the instances where the authors did not know what they were writing about - not just typos, they had no clue what they were writing about. Tim Crouthers and Luther Stanton are two authors that I will definately stay away from now on. Live and learn. It's very difficult to study for a test relying on a source that provides no confidence. A happy note - when I realized I had been taken, I redoubled my efforts and passed Workstation. Of course, I attribute my success to the Microsoft Press books I purchased, not this rag. Bad call New Riders."
2,Good coverage of the material but terribly flawed.,"This book appears to have gone to publishing without ever having been proof-read. The material that the authors cover is fairly well organized, however there are numerous errors in the text.At times the authors contradict themselves, and at least 20 of the practice questions give an obviously wrong answer. There are also instances in the book where editing comments remain. On page 290 for example, there is a line reading ""???Is it System Event Log (as above) or System Log (as below)?"" - obviously a line that was not supposed to appear in the final text. Even the inside cover is in error - it lists 10 steps for passing the NT Server exam (not the NT Workstation exam).Overall, I don't think this book does a adequate job of preparing someone for the exam."
1,First review NOT for this book!,My review that appears at the beginning was NOT submitted for this book! It was submitted some time ago for an earlier New Riders NT Workstation book ISBN 1-56205-769-3. My review (and possibly that of the others) was apparently migrated from that book (I thought it was unusual that this recently-released book already had five reviews).
1,Would not use for a pie,There was not hint of a whole cherry. It put me in mind of a very thick jelly. Could probably be used as a filling between cake layers.
1,Worthless,"While it wasn't a large investment, I would have expected the item to at least be functional. It isn't.Its made poorly so it can't support its own weight, and thus will just droop or fall off.Buyer look elsewhere."
1,One of a kind,This is one of a kind sun shade. It works as advertised only when it's placed on the outside of the vehicle's windshield. It works more like a dashboard cover on the inside.
5,5 hp repair manual,Very helpful in maintenance and fixing small or large problems with ALL 5hp engines. GREAT BUY. Found the book the be very helpful.
4,Excellent small engine mechanic guide,This is an ideal book for anyone strating out in small engine mechanics. I particiularly like the style of writing. It felt more accesible to somebody like me who has moderate mechanical knowledge which has been much improved by this book.
1,Not up to the Haynes standard . . .,"Sorely disappointed. This manual is not up to the normal level of detail and quality I expect from Haynes Manuals - of which I have many. No info on electronics! Print quality can be rather weak in some Haynes volumes, but this was poor. I returned it and found what I needed to know on the web."
3,Great for Novice,"The instructions in this manual are great for the beginner small engine tech. However, the latest engines are not included, which is too bad. It's time for an update on the material."
3,GOOD.....BUT!,"Well you better look to make sure YOUR small engine is covered in the book BEFORE spending any $$$ for it.Even then, my Honda lawnmower engine was covered but inadequately. Had to take it to a professional shop(not the reason for purchasing the book). He even said that the material in the book was WRONG!(slow speed adjustments). However, interesting reading."
2,Repair Engine Book,"Not very up to date old print most of the illustration are the same as the ones I've bought 20year ago, I purchase two different book, small engine up to 5HP and 5 through 20HP, both of the same quality, new front cover old print old picture, One book was copied dated 1990 but the illustration are well over 20yr old.Rip-off"
2,Haynes repair manuals,"I was an ACE automotive tech. for many years. I am retired now and I have several Haynes automotive repair manuals. Generally speaking, Haynes manuals have a lot of information. However often time there information is incomplete or in some cases wrong. I now tinker with small engines and I have the Haynes Small Engine Repair Manual. I was not satisfied with the book. There is a lot of other literature available with more and better information."
3,Guess who's back !,"There are some rare, exceptional artists for whom you are ready to wait for a long time. Shannon Wright is one of them and her most anticipated brand new album is eventually out for our own pleasure. Once again, Mr Steve Albini is mastering the jewel and the delivery is exquisite but quite demanding. Shannon Wright knows how to move the listener, she can play every instrument she bumps into. ""Over the sun"" is Wright's gloomiest achievment, it is dark but intense, it is sad but beautiful, it is nothing but sincere.Maybe lacking the thinniest streek of light that would have lightened it somehow, this ""9-tracks walk of pain and self-depreciation"" is still way above average but not as varied as her previous works though. Thank you Shannon, now I've got a reason to wait for Fiona Apple's long overdue third masterpiece."
2,"Many good titles, but it's all instrumentals.","This 3-CD set has a lot of good, promising song titles, but they are all just instrumentals. There is a nice collection of piano, saxaphone, organ, guitar, and flute (pan flute). It makes for nice dinner music, but not the kind of music you want to sit down and listen to."
3,the gods must be crazy,"I thought I had lost my mind until I read the other reviews. No defect on the DVD, also no English translation on the most interesting part of the film, the interview with the main character. We want our money back Sony. The films are fine, the first is the best, but what is the point of special features in a language not native to this country?"
3,Special Features Problem - Work Around,"The interview w/the star does not automatically provide a translation. My husband was able to get it to work by turning on the closed captions.It's rather sad. The man just wanted to help his people and basically was paraded about, got TB and then was forgotten again."
5,Beautiful madness!,"These two films justify the phrase ""sophisticated slapstick."" They may contain a few cliches, but if so they are so uniquely presented that they become precedent-setters. The cultural aspect is also divinely inspired, and the ingenious use of animals makes the recipe complete. In short, these are fabulously entertaining works of art, and if they were on DVD I would purchase them in an instant. I might even consider buying two copies at once . . ."
4,Gods must be crazy review.,"The DVD and cover were both in excellent condition. The movie itself,was very funny and entertaining."
5,"The Gods Must be Crazy,, 1 & 2","I'm still laughing about both part 1 & 2 of ""The Gods Must be Crazy"" both are good clean movies and have very funny scenes.The Land Rover part is still making me chuckle.Pleasure to see a really funny movie.Can't wait for 3&4. The landing gear on the planewas very unusuall,, the movies are well done.I first saw part one on TV and liked it so I bought parts 1&2for myself and also sent another set to a friend and sheand her daughters have watched both parts 5 times,, so far.Walt Wilkinson"
5,Wonderful,"With a strong and abiding interest in things aboriginal, I love this movie. Clearly made for entertainment rather than serious study, the movie is none the less a special treat. Nice plot, plenty of humor, cinematography and production values just OK."
4,The Gods Must Be Crazy Series Great Family Movie,This is a great family movie that I enjoyed watch with my kids. I saw it as young boy and it was fun then and now.
5,Love it!,I am really happy with this product. These are movies I enjoyed with my family growing up and now I can share it with my kids.
3,its ok,i didnt know that i couldnt play it on my dvd..brought it for a christmas gift but will make it work!! she still loves the movie
1,The video was in PAL format!,I love the movie but the video wouldnt play on my DVD player because it is made for NTSC DVD player and I wasnt aware of it being from overseas. So I wasted my money.
4,One out of two....,"The first one is a funny, worth while movie...but the second one, was dissapointing. Buy the set to watch the first movie and just consider the second one a freebie! I would have given the first movie a five star rating."
4,Funny Movies,"Simple, funny movies are something we should have more of. I really enjoy watching these movies."
5,movie,This movie was a gift. It was something that my family had wanted forever and could not find in the stores. I looked at Amazon and there it was!!! They were very happy.
1,Are they kidding,"I like both of these movies very much and they are fine on the DVD. I cannot believe the special feature mess-up. It makes me not only angry but I feel like Columbia Tri-Star ripped me off. The most interesting special feature is when they go back to interview n!xau and ask him questions. WHERE ARE THE ENGLISH SUBTITLES????? WHAT IS HE SAYING?????? You, like me will have no idea. This is not against amazon but... buy this DVD directly from Columbia-TriStar and when you do tell them you only want it if it has english subtitles in the special features. THEY SHOULD RECALL THE DVD!!!!!!IT SUX."
4,GREAT MOVIE,The first is ok but #2 is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen ! Laughed all the way thru it !
4,Entertaining movies,Funny and entertaining for the entire family. Have watched them several times and enjoy them each time.
4,Very actual - should be seen today!!!,"My boyfriend has been going on and on about this film. Now I understand why!!! It's a classic - touches the human mind on many levels, and it is very actual. It's first sequence, when the Coke bottle is first discovered and its consequences, should be shown, I believe, to kids at school and discussed. And to adults in Corporations and discussed.Some of the other sequences become instant classics in your mind (the Land Rover with no handbreaks...). Innocent at time, very poignant in others. And, like initially said, could have easily been filmed today - nothing much has changed in humankind."
4,You Must be Crazy,"These movies are old now, but good humor never dies. The Gods Must Be Crazy I is a bit more low budget, but is still very funny. I laughed so hard at certain scenes that I couldn't make any noise. The Gods Must Be Crazy II is equally as funny. You have to be able to appreciate this style of humor to thoroughly enjoy it."
5,Fun in Africa,"Two delightful, humorous, and timeless stories about the adventures of an african bushman struggling with modern civilization. A must have and see set."
5,Wonderful Fun,"If you are looking for something a little different and don't take yourself too seriously, spend a little time watching each of these movies. They aren't big budget flicks but they do take you away from the complications we overburdon ourselves on a day to day basis.My 5 year old really enjoys both movies, as well. The children in part II are way too adorable!If you would like to learn more about the real Bushmen of the Kalahari do a search on the internet. They could use your help."
5,Wonderful,The second one is even funnier then the first I have not seen this movie in a very long time
5,Very funny stories!,I like these 2 comedies. They are so funny. The whole family enjoy them. My 9 yr old daughter watched them twice in a row!
4,funny side of life,"I liked this movie just for the fun of it. This is a ""must buy"" for those with a great sense of humor."
2,Movie excellent - DVD horribly flawed,"I love the movie ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" and want everyone to see it, but don't buy the current DVD -- wait for (nay, demand) a rerelease of the DVD that includes English subtitles on N!Xau's dialogue in the the special feature, ""Journey to Nyae Nyae"" (the Japanese subtitles are there; the negligence that omitted the English ones is egregious as well as frustrating). Get on Columbia TriStar's case about this one and let's get a new DVD made!"
4,The Gods Must Be Crazy,This is our favorite movie/DVD. But for some reason we had to keep the volume very high on this DVD and this is why I rated it only 4. The price was excellent and of course Amazon's delivery is always fast.
5,hilarious,I remember seeing this movie as a kid and loved. When I came across this DVD on amazon I did not think twice about buying it. It is hilarious and your whole family will love watching it.
4,Shape shifting/mind reading aliens and Paranoia,"In the first book we learned of the ""ambimorphs"" and the threat that they pose to humanity. Well in the second book we are introduced a second alien species, this one able to detect the ambimorphs regardless of their physical form. Lots of running around, ambimorphs keep showing up and getting blown away. I think what I liked most about the book is the atmosphere and setting. I mean shapeshifters are common enough, but ones that can ready your mind are a new one to me. The only disapointment from this well written book is the ending, which leaves the ultimate resolution of the conflict unresolved."
4,funny costume,It's a funny costume but I recommend to buy a wig apart if you really want be Princess Fiona for a day
3,Ho hum,"I bought this CD only to have a recording of the Derbyshire March, as I couldn't find one anywhere else. In general, I don't enjoy orchestral pieces played by wind ensembles, and I found most of the rest of the CD just ""ho hum."" They are arranged decently and played adequately."
5,"Althy, Emmy, Chris, Debbie and Bonnie's adventures","This series of books (Happy Little Family, Up and Down the River, Schoolhouse in the Woods and Schoolroom in the Parlor) is a wonderful set of stories about five children and their adventures. My friends and I affectionately refered to them as the ""Bonnie books"" and they will be enjoyed by those who love the Little House books, The Saturdays' series, the Sydney Taylor series (All of a Kind Family) and the current American Girl phenomenon. Highly recommended!"
2,"The book was well written, but there was so little to it.","I'm not sure if two essays constitute enough to call a book.I enjoyed reading the essays, but was disappointed at the amount of material in it."
4,Nice reminiscence,"Beautiful reminiscence, written from the heart, full of love toward this remarkable and pioneering vehicle. If you love motorized ways of communications you would love the nostalgia in this book."
3,A short trip,"This publication comes looking like a book, but is a very short essay by the great EB White. Interesting but not really worth the money, unless you're a serious Ford aficionado."
5,Farewell to model T and From Sea to Shining Sea,My husband enjoyed this book immensely and I was thrilled that I received it before Christmas as was told when ordering it. Would definitely order from this seller again.
3,"White is good, editing is not","This edition ranks only a ""3"" -- not because of any flaw in E. B. White's prose, but because it lacks appropriate editing. The essay ""Farewell to Model T"" was not solely written by White, but this fact is found on Google, not in the book. A few minutes to write a brief introduction would have been a better editorial choice."
5,great product,I have enjoyed this flag thoroughly and was happy with the product. It arrived in a timely fashion.
5,Arrived in Excellent Condition,"The flag is in great shape, like new. It is now in my collection of flags. I would say that it is amongst the better flags I own. Intifada."
5,Great Little Book,"A familiar story, in this little book we are told about old King Cole. Each line is put on a separate page with it's own illustration. This really helps to bring the story to life for the little one. It's a fun read and the book is just the right size for them to hold. Great little book.Shirley Johnson"
5,The 87th Meets Its Moriarty,Someone is making threatening phone calls to various upright citizens. The 87th Precinct meets the Deaf Man for the 1st time in this exciting procedural. This mastermind always hatches a convulted scheme to pull off his crimes and the 87th is usually roped in. We also get Bert Kling trying to find the vicious thug behind the brutal beating of a beautiful woman. This is among the tops in the early entries in the series.
2,reebok greenbay packer shoes,"Bought these shoes lasted 2 months with minimal wear, the inside plastic piece, wears through bery quickly. Making the shoe uncomfratable to wear"
2,Case doesn't even hold up,"I tried to order this twice, but both times it arrived with a cracked case. Whether it's on Amazon for subpar packing or the carrier for unnecessary roughness is of little consequence. If it can't hold up in transit, it's not going to last long on the work site. The tools appeared to be okay, but wouldn't expect them to last long. Probably a decent set for the casual homeowner with light use, but I don't recommend this for any serious project. I returned both and went after a DeWalt set that had 10 fewer pieces at the same price point. I figure the difference in quality will far outweigh the quantity."
2,Inferior quality.,"Bought this to go with a drill I bought Black Friday. Arrived with the case cracked, and the 1/8"" bits snapped in half when I tried to use them, to drill through plastic. (Snow shovel handle). Could be user error, but I'm very unimpressed. I gave a star for quantity: I'm sure I'll enjoy breaking the rest of these through the years. (I ended up buying a set of 1/8"" bits by themselves, since those are what I use the most.)"
4,"not the best quality, but good assortment for the price","If you want to build a house or a car or a spaceship, then you probably already know that this kit is not what you're looking for. But if the towel rack is falling out of the wall, you need to run some cables, or the cat is tearing up the furniture and you've had enough, this is a great starting point. Has a little bit of everything so you can do at least one of something to find out which bits you'll want to buy higher quality versions of later, and I think this is the best approach when you just want to have something handy for small home improvement projects. I wouldn't recommend using these on anything harder than wood or sheet rock. Actually, driving screws into wood has already completely destroyed one of the torx bits in this kit, but the drill bits seem to be ok. I'd recommend it to a friend. No animals were hurt in the making of this review."
5,Great Plugs!,"I know these plugs are iridium ""enhanced"" and therefore not ""true"" iridium plugs ( ""true"" being 90% or more iridium alloy in the center electrode, like NGK or Denso plugs), but I managed to get a set of four Autolite XP plugs at my local parts house for $26 and if you go to Autolite's website you will find a mail in rebate offer for $2 off per plug! So for under $20 and just for kicks, I decided to give these plugs a shot in my 2002 Toyota Corolla. Wow! I was skeptical at first, but these plugs work incredibly well! My engine runs smooth and I get great fuel economy! I estimate these plugs should last for at least 60,000 - 75,000 miles before they need to be replaced, but we'll see when we get there. Overall, I would have to say these plugs offer great performance at a low price."
5,Works,"This particular prt num (xp3924) fit a 2003 Land Rover Discovery. My previous plugs had 90,000 miles on them and seriously impacted my fuel economy. It had detoriated to about 12.8mpg average. Now it's been restored to about 14.5mpg average, which is good for a Land Rover and every bit helps! I don't believe the 'iridium' style plug had any impact if the fuel economy, it's more of feature to help with the longevity of the plug."
2,Wrong spark plug,"I got the package on time and i took my Jaguar stype 2000 model to the garage to change the spark plug.But the spark plugs did not match and so could not be fixed on my car.So if you have a Jaguar Stype 2000 model,this spark plug is not for your car.Ironically before i bought the plug it was said to fit Jaguar S type 2000 model."
3,Manual pull down projector,"I HAVE THE SCREEN PULL DOWN BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RETRACT IT AFTER I FOLLOWED ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS.I DO LIKE THE VIEW AND SMOOTHNESS OF THE MATERIAL. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM,OTHERWISE I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE. PLEASE ADVISE."
4,Love the silent operation,It's a bargain. I've paid the same price for a manual screen a few years ago. The motor is silent when the screen rolls down.
4,Great value for price,This was a replacement screen for a different brand on which the motor failed. It has been great. Only complaint would be it is slow coming down and going up but the motor is super quiet. This is the second Elite screen my husband and I have purchased for churches we have been assigned. The first was purchased in 2009 and it is still working well.
3,"The screen may be fine, but the dimension is NOT 79 inches! Try 92. Would not fit designated spot.","Again: The screen may be fine, but the dimension is NOT 79 inches! Try 92. Would not fit designated spot. Arrived, long box scared me and rightly so. The listed length of product (the 113 is the diagonal, and I should have done the math, but trusted the Amazon product description--of course when it says 79 by 79 by 4 it likely means 92 by 4 by 4. The extra 12 inches meant it was impossible to install and had to be returned. Bad business for the normally wonderfully astute Amazon, as they pay shipping both ways. Still, but I tried."
5,Trully Amazing !!!,First I thought it would be just another Japanese Animation Movie. After watching these I was amazed by the quality of the animation and the story. Worth buying. Trust me youwon't regret watching this movie.
3,Hmmmm....,"I was reading some reviews for this movie and came across one that said princess mononoke reminded the person of another anime film called ""valley of the wind"".The actual title of the movie he was refering to is ""Warriors of the wind"".And he was right.The lead character wears the same outfit hat and all,and at one point when mononoke refered to ""giant animals in the forest"" I could've sworn I was watching w.o.t.w.2.Even the ""curse"" the character must find a way to cure was covered in this 1982 anime.Check it out,if you can find it."
5,A must,"This has to be one of the best anime films ever made. The subtleties of this film are truely amazing. At first you might find the film a little light especially if your a fan of Ninja Scroll type violence but the action in this movie is far more different then just plain blood and guts, In this film each act of violence has a meaning and effect, like the real world.This is a mystical story of wonderment and I would recommend it to anyone, not just anime fans."
5,I was in love with the first preview of this movie....,"And my adoration has only increased with repeated viewings of the movie.Normally I don't like anime very much. It's not that the animation itself isn't usually fabulous, because it is. Genrally, however, I really do not like the storylines.This movie however, is absolutely magnificent. The story is so deep, so moving, and so profound that this is actually one of my top ten favorite movies. The spiritual ideas expressed in this story could change a persons life if they let it.Watch this movie, ""with eyes unclouded by hate"" and you will see what I mean. It is a MUST for all spiritually minded people!"
5,hell of a movie,"This movie seems likes it was created by angels! Its breathtaking, kickass, leathil, and romantic! This movie makes Akira, Spirited Sway, and Castle in the Sky look like a comerchal! I recomed you watch this movie!!!!!!"
4,pretty good for my first,"At first, I had some misgivings about the whole ""anime"" thing. I figured they all had bad animation and bad plots. Well, this one, my first, surprised me. The animation was as good as I have ever seen, while the story is very interesting.It is about young man who is infected by a plague of hatred. He has to rid himself of the plague, for it has taken over his arm and will take over his whole body and soul. At the same time, his quest leads him to be the mediator between two clashing cultures: iron making people and forest loving animals.As ""anime"" goes, I hear it is one of the better ones, but for just an entertaining movie, well it is different, but not bad."
2,Down with Macro Vision!,"This is the best anime movie I've ever seen, but DO NOT get the VHS! The tape has Macro Vision. It can mess up the screen. The whole show, the top (and sometimes bottom) inch or so of the screen will be freaking out and it CAN'T be fixed with tracking. You might also hear a lot of static. It isn't as bad on the better quality VCRs, but this happens on all of them. Get the DVD! It has language choices and subtitles, and(right now) is like $80 cheaper!"
5,Fantastic and whimsical,Such a fun movie. Miyazaki does such a great job telling stories with a spirit that's both whimsical and heartwarming.
5,Buy it. It's REALLY worth it.,"I went to see this movie on the cinema. It was just great! I knew I had to buy it, see it again. The magic, the reality and the bravery made me love it. There was one thing wrong, though. The movie was rated for six year old children. But it's too violent for them and they couldn't understand it anyway."
5,"Great Movie, classic Miyazaki",I heard about this movie before but never thought anything of it.....then i saw Howl's Moving Castle. It was a really great find and after seeing that i had to see more Miyazaki! So I found this one..... and it didnt disappoint. I recommended watching this one if you've never seen a Miyazaki film. The musical scores alone for his films warrant a watch.
5,Princess Mononoke,"Director Hayao Miyazaki, picks his projects very selectively, only choosing things he finds worth viewing. This anime has every story line angle that could possible be out there.... Man vs. Man; Man vs. Machine, Man vs. Nature, Man vs. Himself, Man vs. Woman, Man vs. Society; Man vs. Greed/ Power. What a well rounded told story for a cartoon anime. The underlining moral of the story addresses the struggles in our daily lives to just get along and find a happy balance within ourself, nature and other man kind. This is an epic fantasy that everyone should see; we might learn something from it. A classic to have in your collection. Lots of action to keep anyone inthralled. Wonderful storytelling. Beautiful colors and art work."
3,mononoke,"of all th einterviews i read -everyone said this was an out standing movie-i bought it and i didn't think it earned 4 or 5 stars!i think it takes sometime to get into this movie,i just have to say i was dissappointed in the movie and for the price i don't think it was worth it."
3,Spirits galore,"Bought this on reputation of Miyasaki but didn't like the fact there were so many spirit creatures. If I had known there was so much spiritism in the film, I wouldn't have bought it."
5,Hell Yeah!,"This is, without question one of the greatest Anime's ever. I have been waiting since the first time i saw this movie for it to come out on video. Hayao Miyazaki has been called the Walt Disney of Japan, but Walt Disney has never put out anything nearly as incredible as Mr. Miyazaki! Anyone with any taste at all should own this movie."
5,A wonderful anime......,"As an avid anime watcher and manga reader, I must say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, if not the best. The storyline is strong, and the animation..... Even my critical family loved it.Prince Ashitaka from a almost-cleaned-out clan kills a attacking deamon, finding that it is a boar driven from anger into a tarugami. He sets out to find a cure to the curse the boar placed on him, and stumbles on Iron Town. He learns that the mistress is good, yet evil, and that a war is raging between the Gods and the people of Iron Town. It is he, cursed as he is, to find a way to stop the fighting.The story goes on to include characters with highly described profiles, and more complicated animation. This deserves six stars."
1,A warning....,"For the love of god do not buy this movie. I cannot stress that point well enough. While I understand how the fantasy elements may have wooed other reviewers, for me, this movie ended my fascination with Japanime. From the mindless plot to the super-environmentalist charachters this movie is a dud all the way through. If you rent or buy Japanime looking for action and violence, (things that I am sure many people think of when they hear ""Japanime"") not a sappy plot and some of the most insipid ideas ever, you should stay away from this movie. But, if you're looking for something that really is that laden with mystique and faeries and other annoying pieces of fantasy lore, buy this movie. So, let's recap shall we? If you like action, like me, this is the most God-Awful creation ever to find its way into your VCR. If you like fantasy, i'm sure you'll love this. Just a warning."
2,"Overhyped, it's not as great as you hear","Mononoke Hime is a childs movie (Ages 5-12) plain and simple. It is not a great movie. The story is about plant-like and animal demons terrorising the humans becuase the humans are abusing the earth (Not a really a bad plot). The story also revolves around some preteen kid and girl. To sum it all up, this movie is boring and dull which is why Disney picked it up. I've been watching anime for years and i'm certainly not some fan who just got off from watching DBZ."
1,NOTHING BUT A BLOOD AND GORE SHOW!,"THIS IS THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN, I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING GOOD ON IT, I ONLY SAW ARMS FLYING AND HEADS!, MAJOR JOKE!, I LOVED THIS FILM!, IT'S FULL OF ACTION, WELL EVERYTHING, YUP, THE FILM IS A BIT SLOW AT THE BEGIGING BUT LATER ON THE FILM BECOMES MORE FAST PACED, ALSO THE STORYLINE IS GREAT, THE ANIMATION IT'S ALSO, I RECENTLY READED THE ONE STARRED REVIEWS, AND I CANNOT BELIEVE THOSE PEOPLE WHO RECOMENDED ""NINJA SCROLL"", OH MY GOD!, THAT FILM HAS A LOT MORE OF BLOOD, GORE THAN THIS ONE!, A NOTE TO PARENTS, I RECOMMEND THE FILM FOR KIDS 10 YEARS AND OVER."
1,The Worst Video That Dared To Show It's Face In Anime,"Princess Mononoke Was Boring,Disgusting,And Dissapointing.My Boyfriend Said To Me,""This Is My Favorite Anime Movie."" ""You Should Really Watch It Sometime."" Boy,Was He Wrong! This Was No Competition Compared To MY Favorite Anime Film,""Grave Of The Fireflies"" Which I Gave Five Stars On.I Advise You,Only Get This Video If You Like Gory Fight Scenes,And Looking At Women In Bathrobes."
1,Vomit inducing,"This movie totally grossed me out. It shows giant ugly pigs with boils and pus on their body infecting the hero. Lots of vomit inducing scenes and offensive scenes where people worship the slimy pigs. Don't listen to the hype. Skip this one. For good anime, check out ""Ninja Scroll"" or ""Ghost in the shell"". Both include adult and provacative content, but they did not make me puke my lunch."
1,THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,This is the worst movie I have seen. The story is way confusing I could not understand it. And so gory! If I tell you on this review I will probley get in trouble. I guess this would have been a good moview if it was not gory but it got in the way of things and it took my mind off of the story. I would not suggest this for young kids. Even young teens this is 2 gory!I hope this helps
5,THE best anime I've ever seen.,"Okay, so I've just gotten into anime, and have only seen about 30 anime movies, but this is by far the best I've seen to date. I bought Howl's Moving Castle a while back and decided to get everything I could involving Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli and I was a amazed that I liked this movie even better than Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away. I'm a nature lover too, so this movie really hits the right note with me."
5,A Wicked Masterpiece,"As a huge fan of Miyazaki's work, this was far from disappointing but truly worthy of praise. It excites the mind and the imagination with the story and captures a truly fascinating world unlike any other I've ever encountered in fantasy. It is beautifully animated even if in only 2-D, it is fluid and fanciful all the way through. However, concerning Miyazaki's other pieces, this one is more graffic and includes some more vicious demon work than other so-called demons in other pieces. Creatures and people are slaughtered or wounded and although blood doesn't gush, some might squirm. I felt a tad of revulsion, but not at the story itself. It thrills. It inspires. It's worth watching again and worth every penny. The dubbing is well done and I love it all."
5,Miyazaki's Best!,"I have seen almost all of Hayao Miyazaki's films, and this appears to be one of the best! I first heard about it at The Anipike, went and saw it at the theater, and bought it on DVD.The sound and picture quality are excellent! The story is very moving, and really expresses the struggle between man and the environment. I have watched this movie countless times, both in Japanese and English. I would reccomend this movie to anyone who is a Miyazaki fan <Grave of The Fireflies, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro> or to anyone who's in the mood for a great anime feature! Now go, my pretties, go! See and but the movie!"
4,"Nice Animation, Love the story!","Those who are into anime will love this. It comes with a nice animation, a lovely story, and lesson for us all."
3,What's all the excitement about?,"I am not particularly a fan of Anime but I am interested in Japanese culture, so I bought this DVD. It's a interesting movie; I kept thinking it is the sort of thing that someday machines will create by combining the plots and elements of various films and stories. If you had a machine that could create animations, and you told it to combine ""Bambi"" with ""Braveheart"" and ""The Hidden Fortress"" it would come out something like Princess Mononoke. It's an interesting story in that there are multiple protagonists; I suppose if the incidental music were not so extremely reminiscent of Braveheart I might have enjoyed it more.It's nice that the DVD has both English and Japanese soundtracks but to be a ""keeper"" I think a DVD needs a lot more in the way of additional material."
2,Epic? I think not.,"When I first heard about this movie I was very interested in seeing it. Namely because everyone was telling me how epic it was. Well I consider myself a huge anime fan so I wanted to check it out. What I found was however was a movie riddled with enladen old messages like ""women's rights"" and ""peace making skills"". This DVD might have been made in Japan, but its messages are fully American-which makes it absolutely boring."
2,"Terrible Plot, Great Animation","The plot of this movie is incoherent. The characters are not particularly likeable nor do they inspire the viewer's care, sympathy, or interest. The movie's point is that we are poisoning the earth with our hate, pollution, corruption, greed, deceit, and pride.The animation is good but very unoriginal. How many times have I seen worm like monsters invading human bodies in Japanese animation? It seems like Japanese animation MUST have one of those scenes.It seems the movie creator is trying to spread its shinto/shaministic religious beliefs, which is one of the reason why the movie is so incoherent to the western mind."
1,Princess Mononoke,"This movie sucks. I have a 11 year old daughter and 7 year old son, and the level of violence in this ""cartoon"" was simply unacceptable. The story was an obscure ""myth"" of what happens without environmentalism- the makers of this film ought leave their social commentary in Japan. Like violence will help trees grow-don't buy or even rent this movie."
1,Lame,"Everybody said that this would be the best anime film ever. They were wrong. I thought it was more of a ""chick flick"" than anything else. I guess it was too built up for me. I was expecting ""Akira"" or ""Fist of the North Star,"" but it was a far cry from either of those. It was lame."
5,Probably the best movie I've ever seen,This is by far one of if not the best anime ever. If you don't own it you need to. The animation is breathtaking not to mention the music score. Just writing about it makes me want to go watch it right now. In closing I LOVE THIS ANIME and thank you for taking the time to read my review I hope I've helped you with your decision.
5,very cool,"There's just something about that Japanese movie styling, isn't there? Remember G-Force? This is a great story, if a little violent for kids, maybe. No brainer -- add it to your collection."
5,Awesome. A must have video,"Hey! This video rocks! yeah some blood but hey! Its entertaining. Fun, exciting, and a great adventure. Children this movie has a couple of language like HOOVER DAM, and BLASTER. I would write those out but Mom is right over my shoulder. k? But still get this movie a must have movie!Katie~*~*~*"
5,kickass anime!,"I have to admit this is a really good movie I'd rate it my 2nd favorite of all time (1st goes to 'grave of the fireflies' which is also a kickass movie but i don't know where to find it cause my dad got it at a pawn shop) its 12:00 AM! buy this movie or rent it you won't regret it. I promise. my fave character is Moro the white wolf god (shes a god even though shes female) i'm not much on information but take my word for it, it's really good!"
5,Fabulous and Gripping,"Towards the beginning of the movie I was planning to take it back to Blockbuster and complain about how horrible it was, but as the story of Princess Mononoke progressed, it became more and more fascinating.By the end it had reached into my heart and struck a chord. Very thought-provoking and allegorical, yet fun, Princess Mononoke is a definite recommendation for anyone who can filter out the polytheistic/panthiestic themes and see the wealth of application, warning, and instruction given in this movie to our generation. Kudos to everyone involved in this work of art!"
3,It was worth seeing. Watch the subtitles -- the dub stinks.,"The story centers around an Inu villager (the Inu are an aboriginal caucasian minority following an animist religion living in Japan) who receives a corrupted/poison wound from a demon-infested wild boar (not exactrly, but this is a small review!). In this beautiful animation (Miyazaki does great work) the hero goes out into the feudal areas of Japan -- trying to heal the land (so the plot sounds a little bit ""Captain Planet-esque"" but hey). It's worth watching."
3,"Not my favourite, but not bad","I like Anime, but part of the magic of anime is it being from Japan... the american voices bugged me, but I liked it overall. Ah well. I highly prefer subtitled flicks :)"
4,Not an Anime' Fan,"I am not an anime fan (in fact, I rather dislike it), but this movie is awesome. Don't view it as a cartoon - it is far, far more than that. Definitely a movie to make one think, nothing is ever clearly black and white. Lady Eboshi, while commiting what an environmentalist would consider unspeakable crimes (and I am one) also has a good heart, caring about the people in her charge. Give this one a try."
4,Great,"This one's ok. If you're used to hardcore manga that shows gore and nudity, don't even bother. However, the plot is pretty cool and it's definetly one you'll never want to stop watching. Also, the graphics are pretty cool."
4,Very good.,"This has to be one of the better anime movies I've seen. Even though the PG-13 rating is a tad of a understatement, (There's quite a bit of gore in this movie, but very little cursing) so pay attention to the rating, it speaks the truth. Also I did see a lot of comparisions to one of the creators (I can't recall his name at the moment...) other animes, ""Valley Of The Wind"" based of the ""Nausicaa"" mangas if I'm not mistaken (It's been a long time since I've seen that movie) but still this is a great movie. I'm not saying you'll like it, but give it a chance, you might be surprised.P.S.I liked ""Valley Of The Wind"" better."
3,princess mononke,"Although a very good movie I saw it as a subtitled version snd would rate that a much better version, the dubbed is given much less inpact. To those who love amima I would reccommend the undubbed verision much higher the impact is more effective when you hear the actual expressions given by the actual preformers"
5,Miyazaki does it again,"I adore this film, and have seen it countless times, and I finally purchased it. I love this film, and it has this amazing message. This classic film will get into your heart, and it will become one of those films that you just get a huge craving to watch, and if you own it then watching is easy!"
4,Great! Like most Miyazaki's works.,"When the kids rented this three times from the library, I knew I had to buy it. They still watch it. Note that it is not meant for young children, because it has a lot of frightening scenes and bit of gore.If you want to know what early China was like, this may help. The scenes and customs looked authentic enough to catch my eye."
5,Princess of Anime,"There are no words that can describe how great Princess Mononoke is. Myazaki reall out did himself in this movie. This mobie is the best anime movie there is. It has action, drama, spirit, and adventure all in one. I can't totally describe how good it is but when it was over Impracticall died cause i wanted it to go on forever. It blew me away. It's just...Amazing."
4,My favorite movie ever,"That's right this is my favorite movie ever. I can't get enough of it. I really urge you to see this movie. Anyone who hates this movie or believes it to be hard to understand are mentally shallow. I'm thirteen and viewed this movie when I was eleven. I found nothing shocking or disturbing. I just saw japanese art work at its best! The only reason that i did not give this five stars is because of the whole dubbing, subbing issue."
3,Dynamic presentation.... lackluster direction,"Great visuals, stunning animation, but the plot felt muddled at times. It is interesting and takes risks in its chosen method of storytelling, but I was cringing at certain moments toward the later part of the film."
3,This was the movie where Miyazaki's,"animation went from just good to fantastic. I consider this one the beginning of his ""new"" movies.But, take away the Miyazaki name and the superb animation, what do you have? Not much. I like the animation but a movie cannot be just carried on the back of it's animation. I don't care that it's ""artsy"" or a ""fantastic"" movie; be honest, if it weren't for the name or the superb animation would anyone be rating it that high? Therefore, I can't give it more than 3-4 stars. The stars are for the animation only."
3,Not bad but...,"If you like deep and complex anime, like me, then this is not your kind of movie. Althogh it has good animation, the story is plain and simple. I think it's a film for a young (15's) audience. If you like realy deep anime better go for AKIRA, NEON GENESIS EVANGELION and Ghost in the shell."
2,VASTLY over rated film.,"I'm a big fan of most of Miyazaki's films (especially ""My Neighbor Totoro""), but this film is a disaster. The art is beautiful, and I've seen both the Japanese version (with english subtitles) and the American version. I originally thought that the director was taking for granted that I might understand some of the Japanese legends, but just about all of my Japanese friends said they didn't understand it at all, either. They likened it to a Japanese ""Roger Rabbit"" --another film that is really poorly constructed and has lousy animation. Japanese animation often looks beautiful and is well choreographed--but they still can't tell consistantly coherant stories."
1,More ecological and antihuman sentiment than I can bear,"I attempted to enjoy this movie for the animation and voice acting but simply could not because of the glaring antihuman sentiment of the film.All of the human characters in the movie, save for the protagonist, were either portrayed as mindless drone workers or hatred-driven dictators out to destroy the ""intrinsic value"" of nature. The protagonist was the only human portrayed as a morally good character, mostly because of how she was defensive of nature rather than her own kind.If you have esteem for yourself and others of your own species, you should probably avoid watching this movie; you most likely would not enjoy it."
1,This guy did Spirited Away too..................?,"I am at a loss for words on this movie. I saw Spirited Away and could watch it over and over for all the charming characters and animation in that movie. True, there were many interesting creatures and many things that were almost dream-like, BUT, thinking I would get the same type of movie........I hesitantly rented Princess Mononoke. The animation was just not up to par like Spirited Away, and the story was just so hard to make yourself understand that I just had to turn it off 3/4 of the way through. And I really wanted to like this movie too. But its unfair to take anyone's review and make a judgement, just rent this one before you buy it....you might only be out $4 instead of $30."
5,Princess Mononoke DVD,"My son wanted me to get this movie for him because he said it was the best work by Hayao Miyazaki. The English version has some very big names in it, like Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Gillian Anderson, Jada Pinkett Smith and Billy Bob Thornton. Even as an adult, I found myself drawn to it, very epic and a good combination of action and fantasy. A good purchase."
2,Great movie in foreign language,I thought that I was purchasing a movie with English spoken. It turns out that that Chinese and Japanese are the spoken languages with English subtitles. Great movie nonetheless. Seller misrepresented this item.
3,Wished it was better...,"A friend recommended this movie, after I mentioned how much I enjoyed ""Howl's Moving Castle"" -which is far superior IMHO. This movie was long, violent, and plot wise just had a ton of ideology thrown at me. All the back and forth traveling, giving messages, got tiresome. Was that really needed? Story means storehouse, a place where things are kept. Give me those things but spare me the 2 hours plus to do so. Ugh. Should have been better than it was.This being 2013, the material/message seemed dated. But I knew that going into it. So, if you enjoy animation at it's finest, you will enjoy this one. The Amercian voices are very good, though not entirely accurate-as said. Characters are pretty one dimensional-typical of the Japanese medium on anime. Oh, with the decapitations, this is not for children-be warned. Hope this helps."
4,Princess Mononoke: A must see,"What an amazing movie with great anime! Princess Mononoke was one of the greatest movies ever and it would have been even better if it hadn't been so violent. Despite the made up creatures, this movie was really realistic. I could see something like this happening in real life; humans fighting amlessly. Yeah, I could see that. Man, I hope that doesn't happen. Well, the creatures in this movie are pretty cool; giant wolves, gods, demons, and battle boars. What a movie! Anyone twelve or older must see this movie."
4,Simply fantastic,"Princess Mononoke is a brilliant piece of animation. I really liked it a lot. It's the second movie done by Miyazaki that I have seen. The first was Sen To Chihhro which immediately became my favourite movie of all time. This movie is more epic in scope and the animation by Studio Ghibli is simply excellent. However, it had some scenes which were rather disturbing. Not recommended for very young children. For others, a must see movie."
5,Oh my god it buetiful!,"When I first heard about this movie I had almost no intention of seeing it. Luckily my family and I had to go to Chicago right when it was in the one theater there so I decided to drag my faily along and see it. Everyone liked it, including my dad who thought that he'd hate it. When I showed the DVD version to my friend a few days ago he like it too. The both sited the same reasons, great artwork, and buetiful active backgrounds. What I mean by that is that the backgrounds actualy looked natural, instead of the static backgrounds which are so common in anime. Do your self a favor and grab a copy of this outstanding movie, whether or not you like anime, you will definately like this movie."
5,My favorite anime,I am not a big anime fan but I loved this movie. A friend who is a big anime fan told me about it. I thought I would give it a try. I was surprised on how good it was. I loved it. Great storey!
5,the best anime,this is the best anime movie there is out there you have to get it watch it over and over
5,RaxinatorClaw,"This is the best movie I have ever seen in my life.The art is amazing, and it's characters are wonderful.I'm a big Harry Potter fan, but after watching this movieI have second thoughts. This isn't a cute little kiddie movie.It does have a lot of blood and gore but it is still a great movie.But there is one HORRIBLE thing about it: it ends!"
4,Great anime,"Princess Mononoke was one of the first anime I've seen, and is still one of the best! The plot is original, interesting, and does not follow the ""fantasy formula."" The voices (Billy Crudup, Claire Daines, Billy Bob Thorton, etc) fit the characters perfectly, unlike several animes I have seen (Serena in Sailor Moon...). The music in Princess Mononoke, composed by Joe Hisaishi, is astouding; I also recommend the soundtrack. The reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I thought the ending was rather rushed and could have been better. Overall, Princess Mononoke is definitley an anime worth watching."
4,Visual Masterpiece!,"If you want to see the world's best animation, rent or buy this movie on DVD. The artwork is superb, almost unbelievable.The plot is brilliant. With the possible exception of Ashitaka, (the lead character), there are no real 'good' guys or 'bad' guys. Although there is a lot of violent conflict between the humans and the 'spirits of the forest', most of the characters are only doing what they think is best for their own kind.The English dubbing is the best I've ever seen. I recommend that the viewer also watch this movie with the original Japanese dialouge and English subtitles.There are plenty of 'spoiler' reviews available to read here, so I won't go into plot details.Unfortunately, this otherwise perfect movie is slightly marred by some offensive and totally unnecessary male-bashing."
5,Love love love,"This movie has always been one of my favorites. Great story, great price, great everything. Was very happy to find a copy for a reasonable price."
3,Not for the kids,"I am an avid fan of Miyazaki. As a family we've watched Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, Valley of the Wind, Totoro, Kiki's delivery service, etc. Wonderful movies that our whole family has enjoyed. I picked this one up in a store under ""family movies"". The movie was much too violent and graphic for our elementary aged kids. Wish there had been a warning of some type and that this had been in a teen or adult section. Had we known we would have watched it after they went to bed and probably enjoyed it."
3,princess mononoke,"The movie was as good as always but the video quality was really weird. like when I have rented the movie previously the quality was WAY better, Leading me to believe that this was a poorly made digital copy."
5,A must have for any anime fan!,"Princess Mononoke is a must have for any anime fan. I went and saw this movie in the theater not even knowing what it was about, but this film really surprised me. It is one of the best anime films of all time. Princess Mononoke is about a prince who must leave his village because he becomes cursed by a god. After he leaves, he meets many people in friendly villages, but one particular person catches his eye, a wild woman who lives with the wolves, the one that they call Princess Mononoke. If you are an anime fan, you should definately check this movie out. The voice acting is incredible, with an all-star cast including Gillian Anderson, Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, and Minnie Driver. Princess Mononoke does have a lot of violence and blood in it, so I would not reccommend it for young viewers. Also, the animation in Princess Mononoke is spectacular! It will amaze you how wonderfully drawn it is."
5,Princess Mononoke!! Wow!,"Excellent film. I can claim to be an expert on anime/manga or anything like that, but I can say that this is perhaps the finest animated film I have ever seen. The voice acting was superb on both the English and Japanese audio tracks. The soundtrack manages to bring out the emotion of the scenes very nicely. The storyline was also very enjoyable. I like a movie that is difficult to predict. I could not imagine what the outcome of this movie would be. Anyway, enough praise. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who was interested in anime enough to browse through and see what Amazon.com has to offer. :)"
3,The English Dub Holds This Movie Back,While Princess Mononoke was in itself a very well done movie the English dubbing is well...how do I put this...terrible. People should learn that using real life actors in voice over talent is a recipe for disaster. Billy Bob Thornton comes off as being a flat and emotionless persona in the movie. While Claire Danes and Minnie Driver do carry out their roles admirably they are far from the grade of talent that exists for this kind of work. In relation to the gore of the movie I must say that this criticism is ill founded. I mean to say when one gets his/her arm cut off or their head for that matter and their is absolutely no blood there is an issue. In short turn off the English dub and watch it in the original Japanese for a better experience.
5,Yay!,Everything was great! The product came sooner than expected and was in perfect condition! Thanks!
5,A sophisticated and intelligient annimation,"The genius behing Pincess Mononoke, combines the legends and myths of the forest and brings it to the reality. Fill with emotion and sphistication, the art is extremely incridible. I couldn't believe it was all that when I bought it. I would recomend this movie to anyone out there who likes myths and tales of the forest and also for those who never heard of some of the tales of the forest. This movie would bring u a little closer to what you been missing out."
5,Excellent Movie,This is an incredible work of art! Princess Mononoke is both compelling and invigorating. This is deffinetly one of the top 5 movies i have ever seen.
4,Disney-ified Anime,"This is NOT straight anime... this is watered down disney style anime.If you are just getting into anime this movie would be a good introduction to the style. But keep in mind normal anime is much more violent, vulgar, and has more nudity.This movie is still a decent movie in my opinion, there's a decent storyline, some cool animation effects, beautiful artwork, original charaters, and a good setting. But there's definitely better movies out there as far as Japanimation goes.Anime movies typically have more attractive female characters too =)"
3,Done by the son.,"Interesting, but not up to the quality that I expect from Studio Ghibli. The story was the weak part of this film."
5,great movie very happy with it,"We had seen this movie before, amazing story great characters, very well put together. It is a little violent for the younger children to watch but we are old and still love it. would definitely recommend."
4,One of the Best,"i don't know how anyone can NOT like this movie. Made with the most beautiful artistry coupled with an amazing plot, this movie is beyond good. Princess Mononoke is sure to keep you glued to your seat with interest and action. This fast paced japanimation is an artwork and i urge everyone to see it, whether you are in to anime or not."
5,well-done english version,"I had to be forced to watch this movie in English. After years of watching (hearing?) good anime nearly destroyed by bad dubbing, I voted for subtitles. I'm glad I was outvoted! I can't comment on the translation, but the ease with which the voices fit with the charaters, and the excellent phrasing really impressed me. Later I found out that Neil Gaiman wrote the English script, and thought, ""no wonder!"". (confused? read Neverwhere, or Stardust, or the Sandman series)The animation and story of course are wonderful, and other reviewers have covered them in better detail than I could. Just thought I should put in a word for the fine work put into the English version."
5,The Best Movie EVER!!!,"I happenned to come by this movie while flipping through the channels on my sattellite. I saw this and thought ""O.k, its anime, and its about some princess and a 'poisioned prince'."" After about 5 minutes, I was absorbed. I don't even and earthquake would have moved me from that T.V. set. After it was over, I searched the channels for it again, but found out it was only coming on tommorrow. Now I'm getting it for Christmas! This is the best gift ever!!!"
5,Archtype breakaway-the ultiminte,"This movie is by far the best movie I have seen in my life, with the semi runner up Nasicou and the vally of the wind. This movie does not quite leave a clif hanger, nor does it quite say happily ever after. I my mind, this is one of the most attractive features, the thing that keeps me coming back to watch it again. It is almost as if reality warped and life turned awsome- i recomend this movie as a must see for life. And if you are currently shoping for younger children, this movie as some animated vilince, but the plot is ment for all ages. this movie set my daydream experince on an all time high. I love this movie"
5,Great anime for any anime fan,"I really love Hayao Miyazaki's work and when I first saw Princess Mononoke, I was really happy to watch it.It has such a nice story and few things that deal with japenese legends like the kodomas and someone said this was supossed to be in japan, but I find it odd there was wolves in it, but I dunno if they're native..Ethierway this was a great anime to see and is no way comparable to disney films there was no previous movie or manga before this was made so it's not really coppying like what disney does with things like bamby, alice in wonderland(sp?), and a few others..Also there is nothing wrong with anti humen why because there is too many shows where animals are some evil creatures, I really liked it where nature was goodguys for once."
5,Don't regret not seeing this anime after life,"As simple as emotions this anime is all about, it's full fill of it.The main carecter is the best carecter i have ever seen in my life, it really presents the MAN personality. The graphics are amaizing, the back ground sound is fantastic, but the subtitel is really bad it just flashs, so if you are going to watch this movie (buy-rent-borrow) it and that is what you are going to do PICK the english version of it.Actually guys I find my self out of words to talk about an anime like that.I JUST CAN SAY DO NOT REGRET NOT SEEING THIS ANIME AFTER LIFE"
3,okay,"The second half was Boorrring. Get Billy Bob's voice outta there too. Talk about miscast! The story had its moments, but they were all in the first 40 minutes."
3,pretty good not great,"I bought this because I had heard so much about it, that it was the best selling movie ever in Japan, etc. etc. While it definitely was interesting, I was a bit disappointed. There are many beautiful scenes, and the plot is set out in a very promising way, but then the movie sort of loses direction and drags on way too long. Also I felt there was a lot of gratuitous violence (I mean stuff that was really not necessary to the plot, and that kind of grossed me out, even more than a ""live"" R rated movie)Anyway, it WAS worth seeing, I just felt it didn't live up to all the rave reviews I've read."
5,you must see this!!!,this anime was outstanding. the anime its self paid true attention to the little details in the story and carried the audience through a riviting and truly stectacular tale.
2,The Three-Hour Epic,The animation was beautiful but the story was way too long; it just seemed to be a comedy of tragedies. That's all I have to say.
2,Movie for liberal tree huggers,"If you think Man is evil and you're a tree hugger, you'll love this movie. Tried to watch it for pure entertainment but couldn't because it was soo boring. Thought it would be a good anime to watch because of all the STARS, guess all the STARS came from tree hugging liberal."
2,"Nice visuals, but very disappointing story","The visuals and animation technique were up to par for anime -- lots of beautiful and intricate things to look at. However, I was very disappointed with the story and the character development. Most of the time, the action just didn't make sense (unless I'm missing a lot of fairytale background that Japanese kids grow up with), and the characters were so, uh, two-dimensional that I felt uninvolved nearly the whole time I was watching. Perhaps Princess Mononoke got better reviews than it deserved because of the big-name cast and the relative lack of knowledge about anime in the American market. I'd rather have watched Bubblegum Crisis again than this movie."
3,Amazing until the end,"The first half of this movie was amazing! I'm sitting on my couch thinking this might become a new favorite on my video shelf to sit next to The Last Unicorn, but the last 20 minutes or so blew it!Yes, I see they were trying to make it out a win win situation where both the side of the forest and animals and the side of the humans get what they want and are happy, but that is unrealistic and impossible.It was horribly anticlimactic and left me with an empty feeling for what could have been if the story had not decided cop out and try to please everyone.Most people give this movie 5 stars so I suppose no one else noticed the awful ending?"
3,Incoherent eco-babble,"The plot can be summed up in two words: Incoherent eco-babble. Oh yeah, and we shouldn't nurture hate in our hearts. Other than that, the animation was very good but, with the exception of a few landscape scenes, not what I would call stunning. My 9-year old daughter enjoyed it more than I did, but my 12-year old was instantly weirded out by it. That said, once you get past the silly non-plot, it wasn't a bad movie, just not as good as most of the reviews here would have you believe."
2,What?!?!,"Maybe it's just because i don't usually watch anime but i didn't really like this movie. It was kinda dumb if you ask me. I did like the anime Ninja Scrolls, this movie kinda reminded me of a bad version of Ninja Scolls."
5,Epic,"This is an amazing motion picture. From the by-hand anime, which seems to be a fading art, to the undeniable and powerful messages it cultivates through seemingly basic storytelling, this epic journey encompasses so much thought and compassion it is overwhelmingly ideal in so many ways. A must have for anyone who appreciates the art of film. *bow*"
5,"When your going to kill a god, let someone else do your dirty work.","The complexity of this story is classic Miyazaki. The story is great, the imagery is breathtaking. There are some fantastic lines in the English version--witty Gaiman at work. I adore the tree spirits..."
5,Princess Mononoke,"Sophisticated, hand-drawn animation and an epic storyline about the conflict between ecology and the industrial ambitions of mankind turn Miyazaki's film into a marvelously potent parable. This unusually thoughtful and transporting tale never falls into a simplistic portrayal of good and evil, but rather asks how man and nature can live in harmony. Set in mystical, long-ago Japan and populated by wood spirits, nature gods, fierce demons, and other marvels of mythic dimension, ""Mononoke"" is a rare visual treat for dreamers of any age."
5,A masterwork...,"I LOVE this movie. Epic story, sweeping score, a little more violent and graphic than Miyazaki's other films, but still a stunning work of art."
4,another Miyazaki spectacle,"being of Japanese-decent myself, i have grown up on anime and in the Japanese culture, and perhaps have a deeper understanding and appreciation than most. however, one cannot help but be taken in by this movie and it's amazing scenes featuring a captivating imaginary world.a great adventure and spectacle, it's a must-have for fans of anime and/or fantasy."
4,great movie,All the Miyazaki movies have been very well thought out and have left a very good impression on me and my nephews. They all love the movies.
5,It stole my western heart!!!!!!,"I was absoulutly entranced by this book. So realistic, soooo romantic, so fun!!!I love it !!!"
2,Almost didn't finish this book,"I guess I am one of the lone people here who didn't really enjoy this book. It was a weak romance. You could find better almost anywhere. I had high hopes because the setting was well done, yet I just felt the book was scattered and many of the characters fell flat. When I put the book down between chapters I really didn't have much incentive to pick it back up. I usually devour books, but not this one. I finished it only because I hate to leave things unfinished, but I really came close to just giving up on this one, and after finishing it, it really wouldn't have been a loss if I had. Even the small amount of physical 'romance' in the book was blah. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't reading the book for smut, but I was hoping something might rescue this book and it just didn't. Even the horses couldn't save this book. I really wanted to like it......but I wouldn't recommend this read to anyone."
5,Better by far than the Horse Whisperer,"This was may first introduction to Kathleen Eagle and it was a corker! Genuine emotion, no easy answers, moving writing...what more could you ask for? Both the heroine and hero seem like real people."
5,good movie,"need to watch this movie. vijay raaz takes it all. if u r a fan of vijay raaz and have not watched this movie, buy it now for collection and check out vijay raaz play in this movie. i could not stop laughing, u can feel ur stomach."
5,Heartbreakingly Gorgeous,"This is a film I have never, ever tired of viewing. The background of beauty which is Ireland, the power of the Irish horses and the warm, lush melodies of the Chieftains combine in a magnificent story the likes of which only National Geographic can put together, in their style. I've run out of adjectives!! Being an American Citizen of Ireland (my father was born and raised in Ireland) and thus interested in anything Celtic, I want to fall through the screen into those lovely backdrops and scenes and always end up crying. I have waited so long to go there and it's possible this may happen within a few years, God willing. But I can take a mini-trip by merely popping this tape into the machine---and letting go. Thank you, National Geographic!"
3,early elizabeth lowell,I've long been a fan of elizabeth lowells mystery novels. Especially like the St Kildaseries. This book is an earlier effort and the characters are not as compelling. However as usual lowell tells a good story.
3,A little disappointed.....mysteries & love don't make HEA,"I love Ms. Lowell. This is the first book by her and her husband, aka M. E. Maxwell, that I've read and the first in the Fiddler and Fiora series. There is nothing wrong with the story except.... the divorced couple's major love and devotion for each other and living separate lives!!!! Not good. I don't like that situation. It makes me sad for both Fiddler and Fiora. I guess I'm not a mystery only fan; but if you are by all means you will like this series, for myself this is the first and last of Fiddler and Fiora I will read."
3,Average - somewhat enjoyable,"I would classify this as suspense rather than mystery. While it was good enough to want to finish it, I have not found myself rushing to read the next book in the series. The writing was good, and the story moved along at a fairly good pace. The plot felt rather dated to me, but was still interesting enough to keep my attention. The two main characters were somewhat intriguing, but could have been fleshed out more. That probably happens during the subsequent books, but I don't know since I haven't read them...I'll probably try one of the author's other series before I return to this one. Happy reading :-)"
1,so-so,I always look for Elizabeth Lowel. This series doesn't do it for me though. Didn't get past the second chapter. Sorry Elizabeth! I love most of your stuff though
2,not as good as others,"I really like Elizabeth Lowell, but this one ( and others in the series ) just doesn't seem to be up to her best writing."
3,Way too Small,They were cute earrings. Came earlier then expected. I was buying them as a gift for my Two-year-old Niece. When I received the earrings they were way too small. The seller should put the actual size of the earrings in the description!! The image of the earrings will fool you. The earrings are a perfect size for an infant and for a baby the age of one. DO NOT get for a 2 yr old or older you will be very disappointed.
1,A POOR WRITING FROM A GREAT AUTHOR,Not all books can be winners. MAN OF TWO WORLDS is a pointless story of selfishness without any direction and an unsatisfying ending. Definitely a do not read
2,Okay,I did not find it as good as I thought it would be. Not highly recommended for those who have not tried it before
5,Cute toddler backpack,"Very cute, and easy to clean. It's a bit smaller than I imagined, but I didn't check the dimensions. It fits on my toddler nicely. She is very excited about it!"
5,Screen protectors easy to apply and fit tightly,"These screen protectors fit better than others I've used in the past. They were easy to apply, with no bubbling problem. They also do not lessen the sensitivity of the Nintendo DS Lite screen. Overall, hightly satisfied. Shipment was quick and shipping costs (free) just what I like to pay."
1,Too thick,This screen protector was too thick and the DS would do nothingwith this on. Took it off and everything worked fine again.
5,Great replacement,Great replacement for the oe battery. Half the size and twice the camera time. Great job!
3,Nice concept poorly executed,"I have the EZ guide system and thought that SRK will be a natural fit. The Jig does not move freely in the guide. When I bought this, I contacted the support and they said that it if I move it few times it will work good. Although it has improved a bit but still not a smooth operation.The vertical and horizontal stops are very crude and unusable.I still use the product to cut mortises but do not use their very crude stops. I would call it an OK product but there is a lot of room for improvement."
3,average,"I expect a phone to be a phone first and anything else second. Although this phone is fantastic for texting, it is mediocre at best when functioning as a phone. The sound is quite poor and not at all crisp. It sounds like you're listening through a speaker phone at all times. My wife has one as well and has commented on the poor sound. I find myself constantly asking others to repeat what they've just said to me.The only reason I give it 3 stars is because of it's texting ease."
4,Some flaws,"I got my Envy as a christmas present, although it is a great phone, there are some problems that I have had with it.The Camera- The lense thing doesn't want to open sometimes, it gets stuck and it feels like im going to break it.The interface seemed really buggy, when I tried to delete my messages, I clicked erase, and it didn't do it. I would have to restart the whole phone to do so.But everything else was great."
4,Envied for my enV,"This phone has worked well in the four months that I have owned it. I can say I haven't had any real ""major"" issues.With that said, I only gave this a 4 star rating because sometimes when I ringer on vibrate, it won't vibrate. It just sort of bypasses and goes to voicemail. I'm not sure if that is a carrier or a phone issue. Like I said, it hasn't been a major issue with me.Other than that, I would definitely recommend this phone!"
4,"Great phone, but a few flaws","For the most part, this phone is awesome! It does everything from mobile web to Text messaging, and the keyboard is great. It is much smaller than the previous version, and the camera and lens cover is great. But like anything, it isn't prefect. My main complaint is that there is no way to go the the previous page you were at. If I am browsing through get it now items, I have to go back to the main menu, go to get it now, and then find the next item I want to look at for every single item. I also think the camera is a bit hard to get to. Other than that, it is a great phone. Looks great, works great,sounds great, it is... Great!"
1,still waiting more than 3 weeks for the phone IN STOCK,"i bought this phone on jan 27 from amazon -- verified that i was buying from amazon and product was shipping from amazon and in stock. STILL Don't have phone -- but i have billing from verizon!! surprise! and guess what? my phone is expected on feb 27! that's the best amazon can do! so -- if you want a cell phone in less than a month, do yourself a favor and buy it somewhere else. you might pay a little more (i was saving $25 over my local verizon store) but at least YOU'LL HAVE A PHONE!"
3,not bad,"the comment about not being able to go back one screen is not correct. you can press CLR to go back one screen.the camera is not as good as expected. you really have to be within 3 feet to take a decent picture of anything.also, the speaker is really bad. you have to put it up to the loudest volume to hear anything clearly even when the only other sound around is the sound of my computer fan, and at that setting, the sound is broken and hard to listen to. otherwise, a fun phone to play with."
4,i miss it!!,"i had this phone for about a year (give or take a few months) and I loved it. I know that now its all about the touch screen phones and apps, but this phone really was fun and easy to use. I never had a problem with it, i mean sure its not the best phone out there, but i really loved having it. The camera wasnt bad at all the pictures it took werent bad at all. i loved being able to open it and text or to just use the front of it. all in all im not a electronics geek, but ive had some pretty bad phones and this one is one of the best ive had just for reliablity. if your looking for a phone thats easy to use for mainly just texting, calling and a little web this phone is perfect. i definitely miss it :D"
4,EnV,"I've had the phone for about three months and agree that it's a great phone. A couple of solutions to the issues people brought up. You can go back by using the CLR button (obviously not real intuitive). As far as the camera and the lens placement causing you to put your finger in front of the lens. I consulted a technical guru for his opinion and after much contemplating, here's the solution he gave, ""What, are your fingers the size of my arm, move your finger.""But seriously, a great phone, I do have one issue. With the phone on, it is very easy to bump the keypad and accidently dial or redial numbers. If anyone has a solution other than turning the phone off :), I'd appreciate it."
2,Weak Sound,"I bought this phone without checking it out. The sound is too low and the phone is slippery and hard to hold on to. I drop it everyday. Bad sound, I am thinking about going back to my old phone thats doing just fine, but battery was getting shorter each day. Had to charge it. Wish I could find a battery for it.Good thing about the new one is if you text message it is a jewel."
5,BEST PHONE EVER!!,"I got this phone about a month ago, and I LOVE IT!! It's perfect for kids like me who wanna text message and IM. The service one word amazing. No dropped calls nothing. This phone is pretty durable, it looks nice what more could you want. I have no complaints about this phone. I LOVE MY PHONE SOOO MUCH AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU!"
5,Perfect for any Lewis Carroll fan.,There is just so much in here and it's great fun to make your way through it all! Very enjoyable to read and reread.
3,Not Garth's Best!!,"A good album musicaly. Not impressed, i think Garth strays too far from his roots. The album sound alot like a Billy Joel Album, not country enough, sorry."
2,Scarecrow still looking for OZ,"Ok.. I am a huge Garth fan... I have been for years.. I was so excited to get the new cd. Everything was fine and then I pushed play.. Track 1.. ok.. a little weak... but as I went through the cd track by track I was a little let down.. It dosn't have the hook that other Garth records do.. If anything could save this record its the duet with George Jones.Its not his best work.. . If your looking for the best of Garth get ""No Fences"" and ""Fresh Horses"" but leave ""Scarecrow"" in the corn field.. Sorry Garth.. nice try.."
4,All Garth,"I went to Garth's concert in L.A. last night and bought the new Scarecrow CD today. I love it! for me it is hard to get used to new songs or I would probebly give it five stars instead of four. It is absolutly Garth. You can tell, as usual, that his heart went into the songs. If you know anything about Garth you will hear him in every word. some of the songs are slow and mellow and some are up beat and fun. As always, the words of the songs are all there so we can sing along and there are a couple of personal, heartfelt messeges."
5,outstanding,"From beginning to end this a great cd. It definitely was worth the wait. I am a BIG garth fan and i was not disappointed.My favorite standouts are Why ain't i running? Squeeze me in;Rodeo or mexico; Big money and The storm. But once again i don'tthink theres a weak song on here. I don't know if there willbe another album from garth( i hope there's many more to come)but if not this is a great cd to go out with. Thanks garth,you're the best!"
2,Maybe it's time....,"Perhaps after all these years, Garth Brooks is finally right. It may very well be time for him to ride off into the sunset. While the material on this disc is generally good, the typical slick production of Garth Brooks' albums strips it of a good majority of its honesty. If Garth's producers would lay off and just let him do a stripped down album of music, these songs would sound wonderful. Instead, this disc comes off as that of a country singer who longs to sing folk and rock, but feels obligated to tip his hat to country. It just sounds forced and tired. The songs taken individually are good, but they just don't hang together well on this album...he can't seem to decide whether he wants to do a pop album or a traditional country album. While I don't necessarily hope that Garth retires, at least a good long vacation is in order for him."
3,"Have Heard Better, But Not Too Bad...","All in all, the CD is pretty okay. I'm more partial to some of Garth's earlier and more obscure work, but enjoyed listening to Scarecrow.""Wrapped Up in You"" and ""Beer Run"" are by far my favorites from the CD, but I did enjoy ""Don't Cross the River"" and ""Pushing Up Daisies"" as well.Garth is leaving us with a decent goodbye, but perhaps I'm to blame for trying to compare the work of Scarecrow with such masterpieces as ""The Dance"". So long, Mr. Brooks, and thanks for the memories!"
1,Roped the Wind,"As a big fan of Garth's, and living outside the US, I gladly paid the (...) Amazon shipping fee to get the album asap. Unfortunately, I was let down by a cookie-cutter, soul-and-creativity-lacking piece of plastic. After a week, I have nothing positive to say about any tracks. Garth, I'll give you one more chance. Jeff Wilson, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan."
5,Great Garth,"Garth Brooks 2001 CD Scarecrow was the last studio album he released before retiring from recording and touring. Fortunately he has released some new songs in the last few years, and even performed some shows. This CD showed Garth at the peak of his talents. Scarecrow features the following tunes:1. Why Ain't I Running 3/52. Beer Run (B-Double E-Double Are You In?) w/ George Jones 4/53. Wrapped Up in You 4/54. Storm 3/55. Thicker Than Blood 3/56. Big Money 3/57. Squeeze Me In - w/ Trisha Yearwood 4/58. Mr. Midnight 5/59. Pushing Up Daisies 4/510. Rodeo or Mexico 3/511. Don't Cross the River 3/512. When You Come Back to Me Again [Theme from ""Frequency""] 5/5"
4,WELL WORTH THE WAIT,"What can i say except it is well worth waiting for.12 great tracks personal best is ""thicker than bllod"",""storm"" sounds a lot like""thunder rolls"".cant really complain about any track.weakest track for me is ""big money"" but still a good track.all in all a damn good album well worth buying.glad to have garth back."
2,Average,"well now that Garth Brooks is back with a John ""Cougar Mellencamp&that is all He has in common with that turning Point ALbum in Mellencamp's Career.G.B. is back to His Standard Middle of the Road Safe&easy Type of Music.unlike when He first came out with a Couple Decent Tracks Here&there nothing here Remotely comes close to Recapturing that Vibe.the Arrangements&His Vocals are Just there.hard to Believe His Material got as Much Juice as it once did,Like His Alter Ego Chris Gaines it feels like a Dream.but The Garth Formula has Ran out here."
4,"If you like Garth, you'll love this one!","Sometimes you have to listen to a song or an album several times to pick up the words or to identify a song. Not so with this one - I loved it from the first note and enjoyed it the end. I don't think any performer has been able to put out album after album with songs everyone loves (except maybe the beatles)and so there are those who criticize this record. But, this is a wonderful collection of honkey-tonk and love songs presented with real energy and feeling. This is one I will listen to over and over."
3,Not his best work,I really enjoy all of Garths music and have many of his CD but I didn't particularly care as much for this one. Have a friend burn it for you or buy it used.
4,NOT NO FENCES; BUT STILL GARTH,"EVEN THOUGH GARTH SOUNDS A LITTLE LIGHT IN THE LOAFERS DURING HIS RENDITION OF ""WRAPPED UP IN YOU""(the ba-bas were unnecessary), IT'S STILL A GOOD ALBUM. ""RODEO OR MEXICO"" IS RATED PG-13, BY THE WAY!!! HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE HEARD GARTH SAY, ""I'M RETIRING""?? THE MAN KNOWS HOW TO MARKET HIMSELF. THINK ABOUT IT!! EVERY GARTH FAN IS GOING TO WANT HIS ""last album"", RIGHT. GARTH BROOKS IS A MARKETING GENIUS. NEXT ALBUM: November 2003 (guarantee it!)"
4,garth at his best,i am a very big garth fan and i have all the albums and most deffintley this one stands out the most .All garth albums have very powerful words and sends out big emotions but if you listen to scarecrow it will make you laugh and it will make you cry.I thnik the storm is a very emotional song and his best song yet.
4,Great album,Great Disco & dance album. What's great about this CD is that it doesn't feature all the same old Disco tunes other compilations have (I even heard a couple of tunes I'd never heard before!) The price is right & the cover is cool also.
3,Use with caution,"This stuff reminds me of psuedoephedrine. Gives me a bit of extra energy and really suppresses my appetite. If I take it in the morning with a cup of coffee, I can get a lot done at work and by lunch time I'm not the least bit hungry. The effects last about 5 hours for me, and then I have a serious crash. The crash is way worse than what I experience with psuedoephedrine or caffeine. I just want to put my head on my desk and go to sleep! Because of that, I pretty much stopped using this stuff. Also, if you're a guy it will give you a condition known as stimdick, meaning the stimulant effect will make it very difficult to get it up!"
3,Ultimate Scrubber,"For what we paid for it I rated it 5 stars, but for the operation of the product my wife rated 3 stars. In order for you use it you must place your finger on the switch and press to operate, once you release it stops, your finger hurts when you have need to scrub for a extended period. my old BD, you could leave on it was much easier to use."
1,Florence Nightingale doesn't hold a candle to this sexy nurse!,"As the product description said.On the other hand, this slutty nurse is probably not a statistician, nor the first woman inducted into the Royal Statistical Society in the UK. She probably cannot reduce hospital mortality from 42 to 2%, I'm guessing. Nor revolutionize education for the world's most numerous health care provider group.I'm merely speculating, of course. The sexy slutty naughty nurse vixen in the pic may have done all of those things. Yeah."
5,My favorite CD,"This Cd just wipes all my cares away, and cleanes my entire home of negative energy. I love it!!"
2,Sleeping by the Seine,"There isn't much French to this album except its name--and a few of the songs are in French,such as ""A La Seine"" (which has pickup lines in French) and the whispered ""Americaine."" THere isn't anything particularly French,or distinctive--it's Generic Club Music.What got it connected to Paris...I don't know.Paris Hilton,maybe?There are a few highlights,though they don't sound Parisian.There's the reggae-laden ""How do u see me now?"" and the creative lyrics of ""Living on a weak end"" and ""Superheroes Crash."" ""Smet"" is an interesting instrumental.If you like European club music,seek elsewhere.There's Putumayo's great ""Euro Lounge""&""World Lounge"" as well as the Paris-based Gotan Project that blends Argentinian tango with European club sensibilities."
4,"Great Pictures, Shame about the Printing",I love his work so I was pretty dissapointed in the printing quality in this book. I'm still giving this book 4 stars though because he's an exceptional photographer. I hope a quality publisher will do his next book though.
5,Rises above the genre,"This novel is a delightful comedy of manners. Remarkably, all the characters, even the uncle, are credible. In the depiction of Linda, a true romantic, the novel rises above the genre. The ending was kind of abrupt, but I cannot fault it.Is it really true, as depicted in the novel, that the aristocracy in the 1940's would rather do housework, which they much disliked, rather than spend more time with their children, because of their views on parenting?"
5,Great Classic Read,"The Mitford Sisters were very prolific writers of the thirties and forties, but nearly forgotten now. Their books and letters tell us a great deal about how women lived their lives before WW2 changed every thing."
2,ho-hum,"Sorry, I just couldn't get into this book. I didn't finsih it. And I need 5 more words so here they are."
5,Alpha-Bakery Children's Cookbook,"This is a small, colorful cookbook for kids, with a variety of easy to make recipes, some simple enough for younger children (maybe 8 years old?) to make themselves, and even younger with minimal supervision. Even though my kids are all grown up and have left the nest, I still make the elephant ears and banana bread on occasion."
5,Medical reasons to do Oxycise,"I have been sold on the Oxycise program for several years, but when my daughter-in-law was pregnant with twins, she was on hospital bed rest. She developed preeclampsia and the drs. thought they would have to deliver them too early. I had her do the Oxycise breathing routine and her blood pressure would return to normal, thus holding off delivery until 29 weeks. (P.S. The babies delivered at 1 lb. and 3 lbs. are now doing great.)"
3,Lacks the cleverness of the first Beethoven's Wig,"I was so excited to see that another volume of Beethoven's Wig was finally available, only to be terribly disappointed by the lack of cleverness and wit. Other than In the Hall of the Mountain King (""It's the Same Every Verse""), none of the songs really stood out. They lyrics felt forced and half-baked, like a term-paper written in the wee hours of the morning and completed only moments before the deadline. The songs just aren't particularly clever or polished. (...)!I don't hate this album. I'm just disappointed. The first was much better, since the cleverness of the lyrics helped balance out the weakness of Mr. Perlmutter's performance. This second album is simply dull in comparison. Not terrible, but not half what I was hoping for."
5,A must for Beethoven's Wig fans,There are just as many great sing alongs in this CD as in the first. Most of the tracks are very singable (the Brahms piece is difficult). Lots of fun and plenty of goofy lyrics.
1,No good,"Believe the people who say this one is not as good as the first. The whole thing just seems like rejects from the first volume. And the reasons they were rejected become clear. None of the songs on this CD, or any of the others that follow, impart the same type of info as the first CD. You can listen to this one for months and still not know the composers or the real name of the pieces. Only the first CD does that--and does it well!!"
5,I loved this CD...very catchy and fun,"What can I say? This was very fun, catchy, and educational. I got it from the library and now I am planning on buying it for my daughter."
5,Doc's novel.....a Home Run,"Just finished reading The Killer Coin. Couldn't put it down! Hard to believe this is Doc's first mystery. Can'twait to read his three others.Loved the characters and how they were developed throughout the story. Some you liked, some you didn't but allyou could relate to. I generally prefer character-driven novels and in Killer Coin, Doc did not disappoint.Each chapter produced new and unexpected literary twists. You find yourself as a reader wondering where is thisgoing next(hence not being able to put it down), yet all flowed seamlessly and had purpose that enhanced the mystery.Would love to see this as a screenplay. So entertaining."
5,Awesome!,"I started this book after having read Wolff's remedy, so I knew what I was getting into, and Doc didn't disappoint!"
5,IF YOU ARE MARRIED AND/OR IN LOVE.....,"If you love your woman,(or sometimes feel like you don't!), I, a woman married to a strangely wonderful man, recommend all men to listen to this CD. My husband hasn't yet - I'm working on that! - But I think if he will, he might understand me as a woman a little better - and maybe even appreciate me a little more, too! (Ha-Ha!) But seriously - LISTEN to the CD and READ the lyrics. It's one of the most poignant collections of songs ever recorded for the sake of love and marriage."
3,Women please be a little realistic,this is an average album. why do women give this album a higher rating then men?
1,Who led Steven off the path?,"Man, what a disappointment. I was so psyched when I heard about this album, expecting a full righteous blast of rockin' Christian goodness. Imagine my dismay when I hit play on this disc and heard nothing but secular garbage! ""All About Love""?Where is the love, Steven? More specifically, where is the Jesus? I fear Steven is following Amy Grant down the path of godlessness and late night talk show appearances. When I saw Amy showing cleavage on Leno a few years back, I just about lost it. I said at least three prayers for her soul that night. I never thought I'd have to pray for SCC. I truly believed his soul was true. But now we have to contend with ""All About Love."" ""All About Selling Out To Satan"" is more like it. There is just no place for godless junk like that stupid Proclaimers song on this album. Don't let some of the song titles on this one fool you--SCC has given into temptation. This is a sad day for music."
2,A Boring Pause........,"This album has to be the weakest album of all of SCC's current work. Granted it takes up the theme of love , mainly to his wife but I feel this was a very self indulgent effort and one that should have remained a private one. The songs just don't cut it and the bottom line is after hitting his stride this album really threw many SCC fans for a loop and one that I think many haven't gotten over when you look at the sales of the last 2 albums , which are stellar by the way. It has a few excellent cuts but that is all I can say . I have it to make my collection complete but I think I have played a handful of times which is an oddity for me when its comes to SCC recordings."
3,Nice gift to his wife,"Steve Curtis Chapman's cd is a very nice celebration of marital love and his wife. It has some great catchy songs, but the last 1/4 is pretty bland.The first and title song is a nice, danceable tune, and the remake of ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" is absolutely wonderful. ""Echoes of Eden"" sounded oddly familiar, until I realized that it was basically the same tune as ""Take My Breath Away"" from ""Top Gun."" I doubt he realized that.Overall this is pleasant, both lyrically and musically, but not brilliant -- hence the 3 stars. I doubt it will be around in 50 years. Listen to samples or borrow it, and decide for yourself if you want to add it to your collection."
4,All About Love indeed!,"Steven Curtis Chapman has done it again. He took us into a world that shows us everything ours could be, if only we remember the true meaning of love. In a time right now surrounded by hate, we are reminded the true meaning of love. Love for ourselves, and love for one another. And most importantly, love for and from God. This CD ""All About Love"" uses songs like the 1st track (the same name of the album) and songs like ""11-6-64"" to show us how we all feel or will feel at sometime. And that is the most wonderful feeling of all: love. This cd is classic Steven Curtis Chapman, and I loved every minute of it! If you're a true fan of Chapman, or just a fan of good love songs, you will purchase this album. Keep up the good work Steven!"
4,Love all about love,"What the ""World"" would have us believe is that Steven Curtis Chapman's new album is a step towards the pop mainstream and one step away from his Christian roots. Couldn't be farther from the truth. This is not a secular album. His love of the Lord comes shining throughout the album. His terrific uptempo numbers ""All about love"", ""Your side of the world"" and ""We belong together"" all contain his signature guitar driven sound. A truly great relationship cd."
3,Different!,"SCC offers up something a little different with this release. The focus, obviously, is love, and the majority of the songs are slower and more ""romantic."" All About Love and Moment Made For Worshipping pick up the pace a little bit, but that's about it. Yet, these songs are perfect to share with a significant other. I Will Be Here is so great and Your Side of the World explores the differences between male and female perspectives. Declaration and Speechless will still get a ton of play in my CD player, with All About Love getting selected time here and there. Looking forward to the next SCC album already."
1,"Go back to ""More to this Life""","Chapman keeps failing. Well, maybe not him alone. Could be the producers and record execs. Remember ""More to this Life?"" What a great CD. But, then along comes ""Dancing with the Dinosaur"" and other trivial dribbles. This new CD is so plain. Lackluster. Now, Chapman is in my estimation a gifted, talented and humble musician. But, whenever you get the record company and their machines rolling, the artists creativity goes by the wayside.I sure wish that at times we could go back. Put out another album like ""More to this Life"" and others like it.But, truly there is nothing new under the sun.Now, this is tongue-in-cheek, so please take it this way.Samson lost his strength when his hair was cut. Hmmm....Steven! How about growing those locks back!Steven is an incredibly strong talent to be put upon the altar of the machine called the industry."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased All About Love by SCC based on his 'brand recognition'. SCC's music has grown and evolved over the years keeping him contemporary and meaningful. However, this album sounds flat and will definitely end up on the shelf in another week or so. No song on it stands out. I hope he returns to the areas which he has excelled at over the years on his next effort. I am glad to read many of his fans enjoy this album, I just found that I do not. I would actually return it for a refund if I could."
5,The Best,"I've installed CV hoses on several bikes over the past few years. Never a failure. Pricey, but more than worth it."
5,If You're From the Prairie,"If you're from the prairie you will really ""get"" this book. I bought it as an addition to my collection of books that help me think about sense of place. As far as sense of place is concerned, it goes along nicely with All the Places to Love by Patricia Maclachlan - this one isn't about the prairie, but it is very moving."
2,Offensive,"I think this book is offensive. It acts as if the prairie is better than any other place. It also makes fun of people who don't live in the prarie. Our teacher read it to us and a good part of the class hated it. We just survived the blistering cold, and then this author comes and says we don't know cold. If you're not from the prarie, do not read."
4,Twisted,"For those with a twisted sense of humor, and who appreciate the more intense form of fable, you'll love this. My siblings and I always wondered which one of our child-hating relatives had given us this as a gift--we were sure we spotted Shock Headed Peter one day! As much as we feared the book as kids, as adults we still fight over our time-worn paperback copy, amazed that it was once given to us in earnest. My guess is that Heinrich may have been a key influence on a little German boy named Adolph."
2,"Der Struwwelpetter - good, translation, horrible","I bought this book from Amazon the other day as my violin teacher teacher (who is German) compared me to ""Zappel-Phillip"" (fidgety Phillip) one day during a lesson and I wanted to see what it was all about. The pictures and stories are funny and entertaining, and I would highly recommend this book, but in a different edition/translation. The Englih translation is absolutely horrible and the inginuity and 'spark' present in the German translation are missing. Luckily for me, the original German text is also printed in the back."
5,A children's book unlike any other,"I was raised on this book, given to me by a favorite aunt who was raised in Austria. The stories and drawings are simultaneously grim and clever, with lessons for children that have not been sugarcoated in the least.The book was originally written in German and one English version (not this one) was translated by Mark Twain. This book has lasted 150 years with good reason."
1,I hate this book,This book traumatized me as a small child. My parents almost dis-owned my grandfather for giving it to me as a present. I HATE this book. DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS SEE IT!
2,B and W,"This is a good book, but this copy is not in color.It's like a nicely scanned copy.The stories are there , but to look inside the book it leads you to believe thatit's in color. Hence the low stars."
3,"One of its kind, but there are better ways to teach kids","We had this book when my sister and I were 4 and 6, and living in Germany. My younger sister was extremely traumatized by the story and pictures of the boy whose thumbsucking results in his thumbs being cut off by a man with giant shears, illustrated by copious amounts of dripping blood. I'm 1000 percent with the reviewers who say that kids today are spoiled and need guidance, but there are better ways to teach those lessons. A parent who knows foolishness in their child when they see it, and is willing to lovingly and constantly set an example and correct their child's wrong behavior, is way ahead of a creepy ""scare 'em straight"" book. But for sheer entertainment value for adults, this book is right up there."
1,Pointless Black and White Edition,"This is a cheaply put together edition of this classic book. The illustrations are small, black and white, and look like poorly scanned, low resolution versions of the original vibrant, full color illustrations. Oddly, the cheaper Dover edition appears to contain color illustrations. Much of the fun of this book comes from the amazing (and disturbing) artwork. That is lost in this pathetic, ill advised edition of the book."
2,Incomplete and filled with errors,"I didn't know C++ last week. I went to the local retailer and bought this book because it proclaimed itself to be the complete reference-it isn't. I see now that the books I probably want are those by Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++. Especially his Annotated Standards Document. I paid $ for the download of the standard (ISO/IEC 14882 from ansi.org); it was a good deal. I started comparing this ""Bible"" book with the standard and making notes of errors and ommissions, but there were just too many. Stevens didn't even get the operators right (XOR). He left out the grammer for specifying wide constants. He hardly touched on the USING statement. He left out major string functions. etc.The only thing this book has going for it is that it was obviously a more complete reference than any other C++ book in the store. If you want the real C++ Bible, download the ANSI Standard."
4,Super Reader,"In this book, Percy isn't opposed by Chauvelin, really, but instead, has to deal with a femme fatale, instead.A young woman ends up in the bastille because of a complicated story involving the execution of her father. When the mob releases her after the storming, she goes the other way, and becomes a feared agent of the blade, and is in fact nicknamed after it.She works to take revenge on those who wronged her, and their families. This is where the Pimpernel and company work to try and stop her and save the innocent."
3,Well this CD sounds abit...boring!!,"Yea I loved the fly me to the moon track here, it's the only version you get on the cd. LSD was pretty cool; but apart from these two songs I think the whole cd was real...boring. Same sounds you hear in a restaurant, you know."
3,Video,I wasn't expecting high drama and wasn't disappointed there. It's a disjointed compilation of C movie clips with intros by the girls in a hot tub. Not entirely displeasing!
2,Extremely poor video transfer,"Print material used for this 1932 film was apparently fine but the digital transfer is full of shimmy and motion blur. I would not purchase any further DVDs from this distributor. As for the film itself, it is a grade-C production with very poor script/direction/acting and is of interest only for shots of newly-built Empire State Building."
2,blueline is horrible,The songs by midtown and recover are pretty good but blueline medic is absolutely horrible. I'm not sure if blueline purposely sounds like somebody with strep throat but if so then i guess they are doing a good job. This album is probably not worth the money for only a few good songs.
4,Midtown is worth it alone,"Why MCA ever dropped Midtown is a reason I do not know, but it will come back to haunt them for sure. Midtown and three other bands have 3 songs each(the 12th track by Silent*Corporation is missing from listing on this page) on this CD but Midtown is worth it alone. Two of these Midtown songs were new to me. Because what you hate is on their last CD with MCA, and the others were never released as far as I know. The acoustic version of ""Get it Together"" is simply wonderful. As far as the other bands, they are good as well. If you like Taking Back Sunday, you'll probably like Recover. Anyway, that is it. Go get it if you love Midtown."
2,not worth buying,"some good songs by midtown, and the other bands, but blueline relic has got to be one of the worst bands i've ever heard and ruin the cd. They sound like they wrote, practice, and then recorded there songs in a couple hrs in a garage. definitely not worth buying"
4,good scent,Was interested on why this fragrance was so pricey. Very concentrated stuff. A little too pricey for me unless I was rich.
2,3 Star Smell - Price = 2 Stars,I bought this from the Creed Boutique to avoid fakes. Not impressed. It smells really strong for 30 minutes then dies down to boredom. I get WAY more compliments with cheap stuff like Chrome (lasts all day) and the relative cheaper L'eau d'Orange Verte (lasts 4 hours). I won't buy this again.
5,excellent!,"I love the Millesime Imperial cologne by Creed, and the seller was very prompt in delivery. It is expensive compared to other colognes, but I find the fragrance classy and understated."
2,No lasting power,"The only thing impressive about this fragrance may be its price. Lovely when freshly applied but disappears into nothing. I prefer Bel-Ami, Equipage for winter and Signoricci, Eau de Rochas for Summer. The Vetiver from Creed is nice."
5,very sexy!,My husband and I first purchased this in downtown Seattle. The smell is citrus with a little sweet to it. I LOVE LOVE this smell. I make my husband wear it after a nice shower before bed. I love it.. must have!
2,Not very durable,This item was not very durable. After only a couple months the suede started to wear and rip open almost like it rotten. Pieces of it tear off easily and I now have big holes. They are also very bulky and heavy for a slipper. Unfortunately its too late for me to return it. I will think twice before ordering this brand again.
