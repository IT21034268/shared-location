3,Work in Trance,Well for starters I am a Eng. I have incorporated my best designs listening to Trance music @ work and home. This Cd is one that I hold dearly to my heart. It's was 1 of the first of many in my collection. Enjoy! It's only has a few tracks yet? You cannot go wrong!
2,not the best by Paul van Dyk,"Paul van Dyk is one of the greatest Trance Dj's of all time. However, this album is not worthy of his name. The tracks can not even defined as being good trance. If you have 15 dollars to spend on a new cd get The new Paul Oakenfold cd."
4,MintCraft Folding Garden Stool,"This stool is very nice. Included bag that holds tools, extras is a plus. This can be removed if necessary/wanted."
2,Poor stitching,"Purchased and used 3 or 4 times and stitching in seat gave out while using. I am 6'4"" and weight 175. If you are over 110lbs , pass on this. It is dangerous."
3,"Time honored traditions, family values and love.","This picture book is beautifully illustrated by Jerry Pinkney and reminds children that elders are to be loved and respected and that memories are to be cherished. Tanya, the main character in the book is intrigued by a project her grandmother is working on, making a patchwork quilt. Tanya's mother is a bit put out by the mess and the rest of the family simply won't be bothered with it. But as Tanya's aging grandmother becomes ill, Tanya begins to help pick up the project where her grandmother left off. In time, the entire family gets involved. The quilt, which includes scraps from each member of the family becomes an important project for everyone involved.This story encourages young readers to appreciate fine craftsmanship and acts of love, as well as respect for elders.~DeeDee Fox, Author of The Ruby Red Slippers"
4,It;s ok,This camera is okay but sometimes the batteries will die and all your pictures will be gone this is good for younger kids but not for older kids because it is more of a toy than a digital camera
4,"For the cost, it's great.","I've read some poor reviews about this little cam and I felt I needed to defend this thing. I paid $30 for it, for that meager sum I recieved a web cam that is flawless. Now the lack of a flash should tell you that as a digital camera, it's better off for use outside. I don't really use the 14 second (or so) of video mode as there is no sound and such a low time limit.On my pc, I run ""XP"" and have had no problems with the driver or the picture software. I've had it for seven months and have since bought a $100 digital camera. My wife and teenage daughter may want to take pictures at the same time as I so both cameras get taken since after all, they call it a pen-cam due to its small size. It was a real bargin!"
1,Paper weight,"Well it is not even heavy enough to be a paper weight... Can you believe a simple point-and-shoot camera would be hard to use, this one is. Don't waste your time, I have gotten better photos by throwing some ink at a piece of paper. Oh and don't try to connect it to your PC, becuase just making a simple flash drive would be too easy, why don't we make propietery software instead. Bottom line: NO"
4,Virtue won't disappoint!,"Since their first album, the quartet called Virtue has set their own standard. Back with a sophomore effort with their cool harmonies, they bless the listeners with their unique sound.Virtue seems to cover all music genres on this album from urban-contemporary (""Get Ready,"" ""Put Your War Clothes On"") to the more traditional sounds (""Angels Over Me,"" ""Be Grateful""). The remake of the Walter Hawkins (""Be Grateful"") hit has to be the best one out there! My personal favorite is the ""Don't Take Your Joy"" which is something you can relax to.Although this album is largely different from the first one, Virtue offers a strong delivery -- giving fans a greater glimpse of their part in the music ministry. It's obvious that their mission is to include everyone of all ages. And with the variety on this project, they've done their job.The sistas don't disappoint and Gospel music fans of all types will definitely enjoy this album!"
2,CASE WAS BROKEN,"CD IS GREAT. CASE WAS BROKEN, THOUGH...SO CONSIDERING REPLACING IT WITH ANOTHER CASE-BUT, IT WONT HAVE THE COVER. A HUGE FAN OF VIRTUE, ANYWAY."
3,Nice CD,I thought I would like this CD a lot more than I did because I'm a Virtue fan. There were only a few songs that really caught my attention. But overall its still a good CD.
5,The cd is great Virtue keep up the good work.,The cd is great Virtue.Keep up the good work of your ministry. The first cd really bless me. I haven't listen to all of them on Get Ready. But Angels is off the train.
5,soundtrack for life,Songs for 'three days' could be a sound track for life. Innocently it envelops you and matures. The first track (aegis) is soulful and simple with lulling voice and strumming on guitar. A calm introduction to an album that progresses with unexpected twists of sorrow and joy. Lush and intimate soundscapes swell with hope and dark humor. This CD a constant in my player especially on nights of quiet introspection.
3,Nice Tape,"Nice tape, a large amount so will last a while, not as sticky as I was hoping for, good for indoor use, not outdoor, somewhat reflective at night but not the brightest tape that I've used, but good for the price."
3,Above quotation is misleading,"In the editorial reviews section above, a sentence from the review in Energy Design Update has been edited in a way to favor the book. One of the sentences in the long review (February 2006 issue of EDU) noted, ""The book, though flawed, is a valuable introduction to green building principles."" The reference to flaws was fleshed out over the next two and a half pages. Whoever created the blurb for this page conveniently snipped out the clause, ""though flawed."""
4,Cruise Ship Prinsendam,A very interesting tale of disaster at sea. An enjoyable read with a few technical errors. Having been involved in this event as a member of the U. S. Coast Guard in Juneau at the time of the disaster I was very interested in the story. Overall a very good job on the part of the author.
2,Blah,"I was on the Woodrush at the time of this disaster. Nice to see a review by one of my old friends here, who felt the same way I do about this book. This truly was not only a Coast Guard response, but a Sitka response as well; everyone in that town turned out to help, be it hotelier, clothing store, or EMS (kudos to Anne and my former mother-in-law) This book just didn't seem to give much thought to the bigger picture. Purchase the book if you were not there, but my advice would be if you were involved in ""The greatest maritime rescue in Coast Guard history,"" to simply keep your memories of this in your heart."
1,Too much bouncing around in subjects,"IMO this is not a good book to read. The author bounces around on too many subjects. He starts off talking about what is going on aboard the Prinsendam, but doesn't stay there very long. He soon veers off telling the history of:the coast guardthe rescue basketthe hoist systemcoast guard boatsthe coast guard crewhistory of past ship disasters......it just gets so boring that I find myself skipping full pages, hoping to find my way back to what is going on aboard the ship again. The author finally gets back to the Prinsendam, then a couple of pages later, he is back to the history of......something that happened in 1745. Uhhhh!!!If I wanted to read history, I would open a history book."
3,Interesting book,"Interesting book with a lot of apparent details, but I had the general impression that the author did not proofread his book very well. Many instances of saying one thing early-on and conflicting info later. But I bought it ""used"" for $2 so cannot complain much. BTW, it wasn't used, the book had never been opened!"
3,A special reason to read...,"I bought the book because I just found out a friend who I had known for several years was on the Prinsendam when it went down. Although she wasn't quoted herself, there were numerous quotes from her traveling companion, and it was fun to sit down with her and find out what was accurate and what wasn't. And yes, despite being on a sinking cruise ship and having to be rescued from a lifeboat in rough seas, she's been on numerous cruises since.The parts about the book sinking were interesting, but when the author mentioned something related to the incident, such as the Coast Guard, he tended to give their entire history--those parts are easy to skip because they were ""filler""."
4,"a book about the ""Prinsendam""","The book was interesting. Why did it take so long to get a book on the ""Prinsendam""?The reason for four stars is that the author claims that this was ""the greatest sea rescue of all time"". No, it wasn't. THE GREATEST SEA RESCUE OF ALL TIME WAS IN JULY 1956 WHEN NEARLY 1,700 PEOPLE WERE SAVED FROM THE ""ANDREA DORIA"""
3,Wrong color-still slams,"I recieved this in three days from ordering it, right after I ordered it i e-mailed the company specifically making sure they sent the silver one, I still received a black on black sub. So now my trunk has a silver and a black one since I'm to lazy to send it back. All in all this is an amazing sub. Im running it parallel with another07cvt124 and with two ten inch jl audios with a 4000 watt ssl ev4000d mono at 1.64 ohms. Each sub getting about 350 watts each, these things pound. Highly recommended."
3,Don't fit!,"I agree totally with Bette -- the discs look great, but don't fit the 14-cup processor that they appeared to be sold with. I have 7 great blades, but nothing to do with them!!!!"
5,Great Buy,"Great look and buy. Exactly as shown. Very well pleased with both look, price and functionality. Really like the day / date feature. Have received several positive comments since receiving and wearing. Looks much more expensive and has kept excellant time thus far. Also well pleased with the fact I received ahead of the promised date. Exteremly well satisfied.........Thank You"
4,Nice watch,"This Pulsar watch is attractive and functional. My only reservation is that the date number is fairly small, so farsighted folks may have trouble reading it."
1,Misfire for Buddy,"Not one of Buddy's best efforts...weak charts and songs compared to his almost uniformly great Pacific Jazz albums (Buddy & Soul being the exception...not bad but not great, either). He hated it himself, having been stuck with the set up by the record company.."
1,Not usual for me,"I was of the firm mind that Their was no such thing as a weak BR release until I purchased this. Do yourself a favor and get ""Wham!"" or ""Time Being"" instead. Your money will be better spent.Long live Buddy!!!!"
5,Beach Boy fan's delight,"This book adds more information to the saga of the legendary Beach Boys, Brian Wilson's angst and the constant push-pull between his creativity and the economic needs of the band and music industry. There are some surprising insights here that haven't been captured in any of the previous Beach Boys chronicles. Having attended some of the mid-70s Beach Boys comeback concerts, I can say they were just as thrilling as Carlin denotes. I enjoyed this book."
5,Interesting,Definatly not a tell-all book but its a good read. Never thought or knew much about Brian Wilson until I took a Music class in college. Learned about Brian and oddly wanted to know more. I wanted to know why he is refereed to by some as a genious. Buy this book.
3,Pretty good,"This is the first Brian Wilson bio that I read. I've now read every bio out there. This one is very insightful, but it doesn't give you all the dirty stuff. It also spends way too much time quoting Beach Boys lyrics. Like half the book is song lyrics. To fill space maybe?? This was a good first read for me, to introduce me to his world. I prefer his autobiography EVEN THOUGH it is surrounded in criticism, and he says he never even read it before publishing... it is filled to the brim with fun crazy facts and anecdotes. Also, ""Heroes and Villains"" is a better read as well. But I find that each Bio brings a whole range of different facts left out in others."
4,All The Beach Boys You'll Need,"If you are not an avid Beach Boys fan, this Brian Wilson-centered band bio will give you the full picture of a band that has always been more than it seemed. Wilson never really went away, as this makes clear, though his image is that of a mentally ill genius who dropped out in the '60s at the height of his success. The book is at its best on the early years, recreating many recording studio scenes that will be interesting to non-experts. This will make you want to revisit the recordings, which, of course, are what is most important about Brian Wilson, not his tortured personal life. The writing here is top-notch, and the story is compelling enough to warrant reading all the way through to the end: Brian's completion of ""Smile,"" his legendary '60s unfinished project. So much has been written about this tiresome topic over the decades that the actual music is anticlimactic. It won't ever eclipse the early hits, but it shows Brian Wilson's quirky style to its fullest."
3,Not what I expected..,"If you're a fan of the Beach Boys, the book does a good job of documenting the historical creation of the albums, music, lyrics, etc. and related events that forced and molded each song. However, in my opinion, there is not enough focus on the ""rise, fall and redemption"" - instead the focus is primarily on the music. I'm not, nor was I previously, a fan of the Beach Boys as their popularity was before my time. I did learn some interesting facts from the book, however, I did catch myself struggling to finish as I was constantly wanting more. Although Carlin did touch on the antics and psychosis of Brian Wilson, I wanted the book to focus more on this subject. This is a very safe book; Carlin takes no risks. I found it adequate at best."
4,Personal Traumas and Triumphs,"Brian Wilson remains one of the most gifted and innovative American writers and producers. He paid the price. David Leaf's masterwork The Beach Boys and The California Myth (1977) gave us a glimpse of the tortured artist. Wilson's own autobiography Wouldn't it Be Nice (My own story-1991)was tainted with Eugene Landy's own summarizations. Tim Whites 1996 Biopic The Nearest Farthest Away Place was also fresh and revealing.The Book does not offer any new material to ponder, but a rather the repaved thoroughfare of the Brian Wilson looking glass. Everything is researched thoroughly and correctly, but bares nothing that a bonofide Brain Wilson fan wouldn't have already known.I think there is plenty of existing literature available now or otherwise. Brian Wilson Biopics are always a good reads, however one tends to wanna quench his or her need to search each subsequent bookwork for saucier detailing on Wilson's personal traumas in lieu of his personal triumphs."
5,Best book on the BBs since David Leaf's!,"This is a terrific book--well-researched, well-written, and in my opinion the best book on the subject since David Leaf's The Beach Boys and the California Myth. Both the 1978 and 1985 editions of Leaf's book are long out of print (dammit); however, Leaf gives Carlin a generous assessment, as do I. Carlin's use of personal anecdotes is judicious and satisfying, and I found virtually no factual errors.Carlin provides plenty of new material to satisfy those of us who already own (ahem) every book on the subject of Brian Wilson. If you're just starting to read about the BBs, Brian Wilson, or the Wilson-free Group Currently d/b/a the Beach Boys, this is a good place to start."
4,Four Stars For Research,"This is a great book for those who are die hard Beach Boy and Brian Wilson fans because it's musical aspects are so thoroughly researched. Sadly, it just became to bogged down on those aspects and really never delved deeply enough into the total downfall and redemption of Brian Wilson. I was expecting so much more on the ""Landry"" portion of Wilson's life, and this book didn't reveal anything I didn't already know."
2,I felt a little cheated when I read this book!,"I have to admit I expected a little more out of this book. I felt that maybe I would have a least been able to gotten to know Ronnie and who he really was. I did enjoy the pictures but other than the poems, I really didn't feel touched by Gene's account of their friendship. I also didn't like the pages and pages of the tour dates, one page smaller print would have been just fine. ."
2,Gene Odom remembers his good friend Ronnie VanZant,I must admit I was a litttle disappointed in this book. Basically it is just a guy remembering his long time friend who just happens to be famous. There's almost nothing new in this story. I was hoping for some cool inside info but mostly it's just a guy that misses his friend and writes about him. I found a lot of it to be self serving. I guess I was just expecting too much. I wanted to know what Ronnie VanZant and Lynyrd Skynyrd were like out of the spot light and off of the stage but for me this book only touched on a small percentage of the story. I'm sorry that Mr. Odom had to go through what he did but he should be thankful that he knew these people at all because after reading his book I really don't know them any better than I did before.
2,Thin and told me what I already knew,"I was hoping for more advice than just be told every other page to seek a therpahist, and there was little information inside, it looks larger cause its also written in spanish which takes up half the book!"
5,Good Looks and reliability for a great price,"I purchased this watch as a little surprise gift for my husband (no special occasion). He loves it and it looks a great deal more expensive than it was. Previously, he had a Tiffany Concord, which spent more time in the jewelry shop repair than on his wrist! He is very pleased with the looks of this watch."
5,Long time Pulsar user,"I owned a Pulsar watch for 20+ years, unfortunately lost it and immediately purchased another. Great value, attractive and overall a good purchase!"
1,Bow Socker review,"I purchased the bow sockets and wooden bow for my boat. This wasa big mistake as the reviews were ugly and I did not listen.Believe me these two products are worthless and I would like toreturn them and get my ego straightened out for being so foolishand buying these products. Don't waste your money, go to a boatdealer or tarp manufacture and let them help. I had to do thatafter wasting my time and monsy with this fix."
2,Broken,I had to ship this to a friend in the States and had her send this all the way to Mexico since the Company can't ship them directly. Two of them came broken and it is hard for this to brake during shipping since its the handle which came broken right from the part that connects to the bucket. Now I have to order some others and wait for them around 15 days to receive them all the way to Mexico.
1,Maxell VHS C Addapter,"It never worked. All I did was to open the package, put the VHS inside the way indicated and it just didn't work. I tried in three differente VCRs and it didn't work in any of them. SAD!"
3,It works,This products works well. I gave it three stars because I have no idea how long it will last.
3,Does not play 8mm,"I purchased the item only to play an 8mm cassette. However, I received the item and the front cover clearly states it not not play 8mm. Unlike the image provided. Therefore, its okay probably for another type but not for 8mm."
2,maxell adapter...not that great,"thank goodness a prior post/review had been made on how to operate this thing. it was working, but when i tried to eject the adapter it got stuck in the vcr. i had to get a butter knife and coax it out of the vcr. it works. now if i can get all my home tapes burned to dvd before everything gets broken...it will be good"
1,It simply does not work,"This product is defective in design. It is difficult to take the tape in and out. It only runs one second on replay and then stops. Unlike my original adapter, which I lost, does not need a battery. I guess it lacks the power to turn the wheel of the cassette."
2,ATE the 1st and 2nd tape,"The package arrived nicely packaged and in a very timely manner. I was happy on the 1st impression. Looked well made. However, I followed the exact instructions on the tape making sure the tape was tight before inserting it into the vcr. It ate the first tape. Managed to save the tape and get it rewound back together. We did get to watch the first tape and all went well. Then we inserted the 2nd tape and it did the exact same thing. Ate the tape. I am not willing to mess up another one of my home movies so I would definitely call this a dud and not recommend it.Could be a vcr problem. Not sure. If you want to risk getting your tapes messed up I guess it would be ok to try it."
1,Adapter,Very poor quality! I ordered two and both were defective! I strongly urge to stay away from this product and purchase something else!
1,broken item,I received a broken item. I don't know if they send it broken or they did not use the proper packing but it was broken unusable.
2,Fragile,"This product worked as promised, for a couple of uses. On the 3rd tape that I watched, a crucial component, one of the the pins that move the tape into positions so that it can be read by the magnetic heads of the VHS player, broke off. This rendered the device useless. This essential part is made of lightweight plastic."
2,Works Sporadically,I purchased this VHC Mechanical Adapter expecting it to work as well as my other adapters had. Unfortunatley it does not. It is very spotty in being used and sometimes will not allow you to go by a certain point. I know my other adapters had a battery that you needed to use this does not have that. I will probaly purchase a new one in the next month from a little bit of a more complex unit.
2,Not recommended,Product looks good but mechanically did not function properly. Lost two tapes trying to get it to play. Purchased different brand elsewhere and it works fine.
4,Good product but not motorized,I had a motorized one of these that was battery operated. It would automatically stretch the tape when you closed the lid. This one you stretch the tape as you push up on the lid. Its easy to do and doesn't hurt the tape any but I miss my old motorized version. That is the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. This did get stuck in my VCR once but I think that's because my VCR is old.
4,Serve the function,"I bought this cassette adapter to replace my original Panasonic which was broken due to battery leakage. I searched online for a long time and couldn't find a same new one. Even the used one was priced unreasonably. So I gave it a try to purchase this Maxell cassette adapter. It serves its function as it claims. No battery needed, which eliminates the problem of battery leakage when it's not in use for a long time. The plastic material seems to be cheap quality though, so you need to treat it gentlely since it's manually operated. Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase."
1,Very Disappointing,"Just purchased this item after finding many old VHS-C cassettes in storage. There are no batteries used in this product which I thought was a plus, as our old adapter had battery corrosion and is unoperable. This Maxell model is very, very weak. It accepts and loads the cassettes without problems, it just doesn't allow any cassette to play longer than 4-8 seconds, whereby it jams. It is trash and I am going to return it and reluctantly buying a motorized adapter."
1,Quit working after 10 uses.,"The item worked well when purchased. I viewed about 10 tapes, then the adapter quit working. I would not recommend the product."
1,product didn't work,"I finally got my tape into this contraption, but when inserted into my vcr it wouldn't play. It was difficult to get my tape back out. This was a waste of money."
1,maxell cassette vhs c adaper,i put the maxell adaper in my vhs player an it shut down my vhs player my friend fixed in we tried to put the adaper back in and my vcr stopped working again.
1,waste of time and head ache,I bought this and the Panasonic AJ-CS455. Panasonic fits fine with my Mini DV. The Panasonic adapter will not fit in the Maxell VHS-C Cassette Adapter. Need to return back to Amazon for full refund.
4,Works for what you need it to do,This is a good product; any of these adapters are terribly susceptible to easy breakage. They're only plastic/aluminum. It works fine; every once in a while the top part sticks and we have to manually push it up as we're inserting it into the VCR. But it does its job!
4,"Works, I think","I bought this to convert an old camcorder tape, so that I could digitize the video. the adapter itself seems to work, but in 3 VCR's so far, the tape will only play for a few seconds, then stops and rewinds, as if the tape is at the end (which it isn't). I was able to view the entire tape on fast forward, and the quality seems fine, but of course, FF has no audio. I may try to find a motorized adapter to see if that will make the difference and let me play the tape in at least one of the VCR's I have."
3,VHS-C Adapter,"Works fine, you just have to watch what you are doing. This is a manual load system and if you bully it you'll break something."
1,Does not fit,"I am not sure why I bought this without looking at the reviews first! Wow! This does not fit my darn VHS player, but every other VHS adapter I have does fit!"
1,Does not work,It does not fit my VCR. Don't be fooled. The tape fits fine but when you want to put it in your VCR it doesn't fit. Too big.
1,Flimsy,"One of the spikes that holds and expands the tape broke the first time using it. Don't waste your money on this, spend a little more and get something decent."
3,It does the trick,"I have a number of VHS-C videos when my kids were young. One was when my son was born. This VHS-C adapter did the trick! I am able to get the video's converted to my DVD. The only problem I have is that it gets stuck in the VHS side.Other than that, it is worth the investment."
4,i like it,"yes i have some home videos and i was trying to get it a long time ago, thank you very much .."
2,Very low quality,I bought this adapter for my vhs-c tapes. When I check it I found that the adapter parts don't fit properly. I tried it just a few minuts I found that tape in adapter goes by diagonal. So in the play mode it damages one tape edge in the rewind mode it damages the other edge. I retuned it to store and bought the PV-P1 adapter from Panasonic. It worked fine.
5,Check your tape before ordering!,"If you are going to order this adapter, BE SURE you DO NOT have an 8mm cassette because this does NOT work with them. I stupidly ordered it without checking and cannot use it for the purpose that I originally bought it, but I can use it with a few others that I have so it wasn't a complete waste of time! :) It was my fault for not checking but I guess I needed it anyway! I got the package in mint condition and it works well for the right cassettes :)"
1,GETS STUCK!,IT GETS STUCK IN MY VCR WHILE TRYING TO EJECT. I NEED TO USE A KNIFE ON EACH SIDE TO HELP IT OUT!
1,Maxell VHS-C Adapter,"The first time I put it in the VCR, it made a grinding noise and I thought it was going to ruin a family video. It played for about 5 seconds and stopped. I checked it to see if maybe I left something on it. I tried it again and it did the same thing. I wasn't about to try it anymore with my family videos. I only gave it one star because it wouldn't let use zero stars. Piece of junk."
2,didnt fit in my vcr,"You would think vcrs and theses tapes would all be a universal size....guess not. I couldnt get this adapter in my vcr with out some pushing and then I got nervous about what it might do to the vcr or the tapes. Im converting all my dads vhs tapes to dvds and its been quite the process. This adapter didnt work for me, it might for someone else. Returning it has been easy though."
4,Review,"This worked pretty good after I figured out how to open it. Specific for certain tapes only. If you have that type of tape, and want to play or convert the tapes, this item worked well."
2,Doesn't work,I tried my tapes in this adapter and it does not work. I tried a number of tapes. I will probably be returning it. Was looking forward to seeing my kids on video. Sorry
3,Works but a bit sensitive!,Doesn't position the tape right most times. Have to manually adjust for the VCR to read it...but it works just fine when the tape engages correctly. Also had to scrape off plastic from the transparent visor like piece to make the VHS-C cassette fit right. Like the fact it does not require batteries.
1,Broke after one use,"was very excited to get this product, worked for 1 60 min, viewing,and will not work any more, do not buy"
5,Good Economical Adapter,"The adapter worked perfectly for reading the VHS-C tape so it could be put on the computer. It required you to physically close the cover to insert the tape and was not as elaborate as the battery powered ones that perform this function....but it was a whole lot cheaper. For a now and then use, it was perfect."
1,video recorder,I bought this thinking it would work with our video camera cassettes. It was very difficult to figure out what size to get and I got the wrong size
2,It's okay,This product keeps turning off my vcr for some strange reason. At first I thought it was my VCR but I have tried several tapes in the vcr and they were fine. As soon as I put any tape in this adapter it turns my VCR off.
1,Dissapointed,I would have no idea because not only are they telling me my current address is undeliverable (funny how all my other mail makes it to me) They also refuse to refund my money even though they admit they still have it.
1,Disappointed,"Extremely disappointed, with both the product and the customer service, the product label on the website did not state NOT FOR USE WITH 8MM. which is exactly why I ordered the item. When I called customer service they seemed to be clueless and were not able to assist, I specifically put 8 MM in my search and thats what came up you cant imagine how suprise I was when I received a product that is totally useless to me."
1,Didn't work for me...,I have 8mm tapes and this doesnt work for HI8 or 8mm. I didn't see that in the small print.
2,Gets stuck !!!,This did not work I hit eject and it went to eject then stopped like it hit something and went back in and didn't come out
4,Worked well,I would recommend this product. I've tried the battery operated version and likened it. Never checked to see if this was the same. Was not. Worked just as well though.
1,adapter.VHS,This item caused a lot of problems. Stuck in my VHS. Would not release.Terrible item.Maxell Mechanical VHS-C Adapter
5,"Fragile, But It Works!","This cassette adapter does its job well enabling VHS-C video to play in standard VHS receivers, although care must be taken during the insertion of the C cartridge so the moving parts of the adapter that capture it don't bind or break."
1,Will Mangle Your Precious Memories,"I thought I found a low cost solution to migrating my VHS-C tapes over to digital. Indeed it's cheap, but you get what you pay for. The directions are not difficult to understand, the product just doesn't work well. It's probably best to stick with battery operated models and avoid breaking your tapes."
2,Not what I expected,I used it with one of my tapes and it nearly destroyed my tape.I put it aside to ship back to Amazon.
1,horrible,I got this adapter to play and/or convert my VHS-C tapes. The adapter completely destroyed a tape of my kids first Christmas. I don't recommend this item.
1,Not good,"This adapter does not work on my DVD player. Not sure what the problem is. The cassette fits nicely, but the tape does not play."
1,THEY DON'T CUT,"I have been a dog groomer for 40 years, and bought this pair to supplement several other 44/20 shears I use. There is no comparison. They simply would not cut hair on the feet of a freshly washed English Springer Spaniel's that was not even dense coat. Thus, I can't use them."
1,Awful,"If you are any kind of person who knows how to cut hair, do not purchase these. They are terrible. I won't be able to use them even on my dogs they are so bad. They do not grab hair and stick when closing. I would have sent them back but it was going to cost almost as much as I paid for them. To get good scissors, you have to spend money. I suggest spending more and hopefully you will get more! Do not waste one penny on these."
3,These are okay for occassional use,"I used these for my son, daughter and husband and found them to be heavy and irritated my thumb a little. I purchased these specifically for occassional home use, and I'm fine with them for what I paid. If these were to be used more regularly, I would suggest something lighter with a coated handle."
1,terrible scissors,"Do not buy these scissors, they are junk. The first test of scissors is cutting. These scissors do not cut they bend, pull, mangle, and hurt. Buy a better product."
1,They simply do not work!,"I only got to use these scissors months after I received them, and they were so disappointing! They look so good in this ad, and even when I received them. But they simply do not work! They do not cut hair properly. My sewing scissors cut hair much better than these."
1,do not waste your time or money,"The finish on these shears looked promising, they fit fairly well in my hand, but they don't cut hair! They grab and pull hairs like tweezers, or push hair along between the blades without cutting. I can get better results from round-end children's scissors. Professional at this price??? Yes, I was a sucker, but the reviews looked favorable. I am so disappointed!"
4,Excellent for the Price,"These are great for the price. Mine were very sharp (tested it on wet tissue paper)They give a clean cut, not as light as some I have bought before, but they definitely do an excellent job for the price!"
5,Decent shears,I purchased these so that I could trim off my split ends between trimmings. I want shears that were sharp enough so as not to damage my hair when the purpose is to cut off the damage. I have been happy with these thus far. They fit my hand comfortably and are well sharpened. I would not hesitate to purchase again but figure these will last me a while considering they are not used often.
4,Clean Lines,"Good clean scissors, work well , seem well made. Im happy so far, just hoping they last a while its hard to find long scissors atm"
2,Right next to junk,Disapointed. IF I could have held it in my hand I would not have purchased it. Have to keep tightening the blade screw. Not worth return hassel
2,scissors,"These scissors are not smooth cutting.there is a catch in the tip end.In short, it is impossible to use for cutting my beard!"
5,finally,"Finally, I have found styling shears that are what they say they are. Good sturdy scissors, sharp, cuts clean. Best I've had for household hair trims. Pretty good value also. I didn't have to spend an arm and a leg. Very happy with these so far."
2,Too stiff,"I may have received a pair of scissors that were less than the usual quality. Mine were so stiff it took some effort to open & close them. I have had barber-quality shears before- these were a huge disappointment, considering the reviews. I would most definitely not order this product again."
1,Possibly the worst scissors ever,"Only the last 1"" of these sheers were capable of cutting hair. The blades had a small gap, and the adjustment screw was as tight as it would go. I must have just got a bad pair. I returned them and will probably go with a different brand.2/4/12 - I am updating my score after receiving the Tweezerman 2000 scissors, I realize that these LUXOR's were possibly the worst pair of scissors I've ever used. I'd give zero stars if possible."
1,Too confusing,"I love most products by Gaiam, but this is not one of my favorites. It is too hard to keep up with. The instructor will add moves without careful explanation, or sometimes without explaining it at all. Alot of the moves are instructed with the wrong side of the body, and because there is never a rear view of the dancers or even a side view, it is hard to tell what the move is supposed to look like in full. I have a kickboxing DVD with this same instructor and it is wonderful. It is much easier to keep up with, but this dance video was a let down. The base moves are really easy, but the combos are really complicated. I just do the base moves for all three."
3,3 Workouts,"The 3 workouts are good but they are samba,jazz and hip hop so if you do not like one of these types then the training could be not as useful. But it is worth a try."
3,"Inexpensive tablet pen, TONS of Campatibility issues!","I bought this item 1 week ago. It's not as expensive as wacom and it's featureFirst thing I found is - the driver (latest from the website) does not pass windows xp test. Ok, continue anyway and it works ok. However, I cannot use pressure sensitive feature on Flash and Illustrator. The only thing that works is photoshop.... you can search this model review on the internet and people will say the say thing about software compatibility issues.I'm thinking of buying Wacom."
3,well meaning but little new information,"I picked up this book like most folks, I bet, after watching the PBS series. I found the film more effective than the book. The book is really a rehash of a lot of old stories that don't veer too much off the well-trod paths...that is, fine folks in the backwoods, front porch story tellers, and mostly white Appalachians.To be honest, a far more groundbreaking and fascinating and rich portrait is the new book, The United States of Appalachia: How Southern Mountaineers Brought Independence, Culture and Enlightenment to America."
4,Explore The Appalachians,"The Appalachians is a good companion to the DVD set of the Appalachians. The book contains a simplified history of the Appalachians and the Great Smoky Mountains. There is a lot more material to be covered, but as a basic introduction of Appalachian history, this is a place to start."
4,Quick Read,This book is a quick read and a fairly sound weight loss plan. It is an alternative to Atkins with the benefits of low carb but watching fat intake. I've had success with the diet. I don't agree with the maintenance plan but as a kick start to weight loss and healthy lifestyles it's a nice option.There is a lot of curves advertising but you have to take it with a grain of salt. Doesn't every diet plan sell it's own products. From Atkins to Weight Watcher's everyone is selling something. You can read the facts around the advertising and still get good information from this book.
2,Curves Fitness Center: Beginners ONLY,"I have not read the book therefore cannot rate it, however I can rate the Curves facility fitness program as I have join and cancelled my membership within one day. The program, in my opinion, is for the beginner/shy execiser. It is not a challenging routine because you are allowed only 30 seconds to utilize each hydraulic machine. According to certified exercise experts (and general knowledge) this is hardly enough time to fatigue the muscle you are targeting. Another set back is that you cannot determine how much weight your body can take. The machines are preset, which means as your body becomes stronger you cannot add any additional weight. You have only 30 seconds to utilize each machine and the musical recording tells you when to switch. At that point, you do your own light cardio. I think it is a great idea for those who are not used to a challenging workout. However, I suggest trying the week free pass before committing to this."
1,Hogwash!,"Again, another so-called ""health"" plan that caters to those who are vulnerable to a quick-and-easy solution for their health problems. This is just another scam to solicit money from those who are desperate enough to pay for anything that might fix a weight problem.Here's the truth: if a normal, healthy diet and a regular regimen of exercise does not help control your weight, then you need medical attention -- not this book and not the ""fitness"" centers that are designed to suck money out of your bank account. Spend you money on a DOCTOR who is a specialist in metabolic disorders - not this load of trash!"
1,Pissed at misrepresentation!,"I didn't receive a book, not the paperback edition I ordered. I received something they called a ""binder-ready"" edition. That term was only found on the packaging after I finally received it. Nowhere in the online order did it say I was ordering, not a book, but just loose copies of the pages, that I would then have to binder myself--NOT WHAT I ORDERED BECAUSE NOT WHAT I WANTED!I feel very deceived and wasted my time ordering, waiting, shipping back, and finaly buying what I wanted elsewhere. I used to trust Amazon, now I feel betrayed and unable to trust them. That kind of information is critical and should be explained in the information--before--purchasing! Shame on Amazon!"
3,"Fine book. Shipping, not so much","I chose and paid for expedited shipping. And it came in two weeks. Otherwise the book was as they described. Some highlighting, not a lot of writing. Good stuff."
4,Lifespan Development (5th Edition) (MyDevelopmentLab Series),I thought the book was well organized for a general look at development and is a good starting point for college students to be exposed to the issues of devolopment.
3,Lifespan Development,"There was duct tape, stickers and stamping on the cover. I don't consider it ""new"". There wasn't anything written on the inside."
3,So-So,"The information throughout the text is very interesting. Although, THERE ARE MANY GRAMMATICAL ERRORS (maybe because these authors are professors at a community college? Ha, just kidding, but they are). Half the time it seems like these authors are making up words. I am taking an online class through my university, and my professor has made power-points that correspond to each chapter in the text. I use a mac-book pro, so the words that appear in the text show up on the power-points. There are many words, straight from the text, that my mac deems as not words (therefore they are not in the dictionary data base). Also, I am a male, and it is extremely easy to see that these women are feminists (not that I care). It just gets SOOO ANNOYING to continuously hear these authors refer to a person are her or herself. Switch it up will you Boyd and Bee? Geesh. All in all, great text, but many grammatical errors."
3,"Okay, but lacking","Used for a developmental psychology class, this book wasn't worth the $94.00 I paid for it. I could have easily substituted this book for any introductory psychology textbook. Piaget, Kolberg, Erikson, and Freud are hardly touched on and their theories are under-summarized. There is also a lack of relevant, current studies in the area of developmental psychology. Most studies are summarized and do not give any usable, substaintial evidence which could be used elsewhere (ex: in papers)."
3,Never arrived,"I would probably give this 5 stars if it would have arrived. I have never had a problem with anything I have ordered off of amazon.Everything usually arrives before expected. They claimed this book was shipped a day after I ordered it, but weeks went by, and it wasn't here. Luckily I found a friend who had the book and let me borrow it because I needed it for my class. I contacted the seller and they claimed it was lost in the mail. I have had that happen before so it is not unbelievable. They refunded my money promptly so I would still give them another try in the future."
1,Dislike,"I bought this hose at home depot, a 50' and 100' roll. They take forever to break in and are very difficult to coil. I won't be buying again"
2,Great Game If It Did Not Lock Mac Up Every 15 Minutes....,"They game itself is pretty cool. My 5 year old loves the seek and find. However, if you have a newer MAC - game is not for you. I believe it runs @ 800X 640, freaks out things in my experience. Numerous times, locked entier MBP requiring restart every time. I also have it installed on XP - works better."
5,Great learning tool,"My son loves the I Spy games and we play as a family, he can play alone, or with a friend. The game is very educational as he practices reading, concentration, problem solving and English vocabulary which is important for us as we have a bilingual household."
4,I Spy,My 9 year old daughter loves 'I Spy' books. When I saw this I knew she would love it. I let her sister sneak a peek and she squealed. She can't wait to play it with her sister.
1,Doesn't work in the USA,"I ordered this DVD for my daughter and was surprised to discover it didn't work. Apparently the DVD only works in certain countries. The website specifies that the DVD is for ""Region 2"", however I had no idea what this meant. The seller should make it clear that it does not work for people in the United States. Very disappointing."
3,Kids enjoyed the show,The kids enjoyed seeing all of the different characters.**** ***** ***** ***** **** ***** ***** ***** **** ***** ***** *****
2,Should be half the price,This is a bunch of old cartoons and should only be .99 cents. Still a fun time with the kids.
3,Advertising Slack on 'House of Mouse',"I have to admit, the video is fun. Like all Disney animatedadventures the graphics are excellent and it is nice to see the'House of Mouse' gang together. However, the one and only realcomplaint is that the Disney advertising machine has once againpulled the wool over the eyes of the buying public. True, thereis a lot of the mouse gang available, but the majority of themovie consists of an old Pluto/Chip n' Dale cartoon and the morerecent 'Mickey's Christmas Carol'. For anyone who has a collection of Disney animation, and especially the Christmasreleases, disappointment will follow purchase. The T.V. ads aredeceptive and the write up on back of the VHS and DVD does notmention that it is basically a reprint. For those who do not own a great deal of Disney animation or the Christmas Carol starring Mickey and Uncle Scrooge, it will be a treat. For thosewho do, beware."
1,I haven't seen this and I already hate it,"This movie is nothing more than corporately sponsored fan fictionas well as toxic waste for the brain. I've been against THE HOUSEOF MOUSE from the beginning and SNOWED IN is a horrifically badidea. For those of you who aren't familiar with my tastes,BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is actually my favorite film. I cannotstand to watch yet another desecration of Belle or The Beast(orif Disney had actually had the courage,the Prince)as I'm sure the hacks responsible here have perpetuated. I've discredited THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS,and it was neccessary to do so. This isn't the least bit important."
1,Wrong region,"I give it to a family member and they could not watch,the video. it is for a different country region, it was not made for the US. That was not in the description of the video."
2,It's really just scrooge,It's really just scrooge repackaged and a couple of shorts.If you have scrooge then it's a complete waste of time/money
3,Totally fine,"Hey, It's a decent Christmas Cartoon. Nothing more or less. The good news is that it's innocuous, which really is saying something with many of the cartoons ""they"" are serving up our children."
2,Disappointing,Stuffing a whole bunch of unrelated characters into one video lacks direction or purpose. Adding a whole bunch of old cartoons doesn't justify the cost. I am an old time Disney fan but this DVD is a rip off.
1,Very disappointed!,"This title includes a series of short movies, some of them were in ""A Walt Disney Christmas"", others are new movies, which are poor repetition of what have been shown in ""A Walt Disney Christmas."" The gathering of all Disney animated characters is not well-blended, making it a very disappointing movie ever. DO NOT buy this as Disney just tries to put something together quickly and carelessly to sell for the holidays."
5,Great movie,Kept my 2 year old's attention for most of the movie and we were entertained as well. Even considered buying the movie afterwards and may still do so.
1,Sorely disappointed,"This movie was like a Disney Channel rerun. Bits of past holiday cartoons or movies took up most of the 65 min. run time. I do not recommend buying it, it's not worth putting in your Disney collection."
4,Goofy learning to ski,"hello Disney Fans. I am wondering if anyone has ever seen the holiday short about Goofy learning to ski. It was a great little narrated short that I saw when I was a kid. I saw it on television way back when and it was tagged along with a couple of other holiday shorts to a broadcast of the classic ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"". I have been reading reviews and dvd discriptions on here for an hour and I cannot find anything that mentions this particular short. If anyone knows if it is even available on any of these disney dvd's and if so which one. Please email me and let me know, Thanks. my email address isryback78@hotmail.com"
4,Fun movie with lots of classic Disney Christmas moments,"This was a very good Disney movie. It had some very funny moments my kids laughed out load many times. There were many classic Disney animation clips including the Disney rendition of ""A Christmas Carol"". I recommend this as a fun movie for Disney fans at Christmas time!"
5,Wonderful Viewing!!,"This DVD is a great buy just to be able to see ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"". Mickey's Christmas Carol is a classic that all generations will love!"
2,Too Many Re-Hashed Cartoons,"At my age I don't buy this type of video for personal perusal. I buy them to watch with my grandchildren. Imagine my disappointment when I try and fill out my collection and get a video that is 2/3 a repeat of the previous Mickey Christmas videos I have purchased. When the 3.5 and 5.5 year olds comment that ""I thought this was a new one, PopPop"" it is apparent that it was not a good purchase. With the amount of video in the Disney collection, one would think they could release ""totally"" new DVDs.That being said, it is still an enjoyable video just don't purchase it anticipating all new cartoons."
1,I wish I could have read this before I bought this DVD!,"I am one of the biggest Disney fan's you'll find. I buy every video (DVD) they make practically and have been going to Disneyland every year since I was born, save a few here and there. This DVD was one of the biggest disappointment's Disney has served up since Pocahontas followed Beauty and the Beast. Especially if you bought Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas. This video IS that video, with a couple of POORLY animated comments in-between. They obviously knew that the Disney loyals would run out and buy it right away, and the non-Disney loyals would take a chance on it. PLEASE don't. Don't be fooled."
2,Did they say it featured favorite Disney Characters?????,"This is a great movie IF you are buying it to watch Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. If you are purchasing it to see all your favorite Disney characters, save your money and buy something else. We bought the movie for our 4 and 2 year old girls who love the Disney princesses. Basically, the Disney characters just walk by to get to their seats or are shown as part of an audience who come to Mickey's house to watch him entertain them. Belle and a couple of the characters from Lion King have one or two quick speaking parts, otherwise it is all about Mickey and Donald. I was very disappointed in the movie and thought it was dishonestly advertised."
1,Cannot Play in USA!!!,"Unfortunately I did not read the one-star reviews before purchasing this video. Iam extremely disappointed that this DVD did not play on any of our DVD players. It isout of region and not able to play in U.S. It does not say this anywhere before purchasing.I bought this for my daughter with special needs. She loves the Disney Characters andthe preview says all the characters are in the DVD. It's a good thing I didn't give itto her before I tried it. She would have been very upset. I don't know how much returnshipping is, but I am looking to sent it back."
1,Where are the princesses???,"I bought this video for my 3 year old who loves the Disney princesses and she kept asking while watching the movie, ""where are the princesses?"" I would like to know that too!! This movie was completely marketed as a lie!! I wish I would have saved my money!"
1,Dear Disney: Release Mickey's Christmas Carol on DVD!,"Hey I know it's on this shabby DVD, which is why I've purchased it! However (aside from the Pluto cartoon which is really good) this video is slapped-together rubbish. Since the ""House of Mouse"" cartoon seemed decent whenever I caught a little bit of it, I thought it would be ok... AND I'd have Mickey's Christmas Carol on DVD! This is a grand disappointment. Everything else really brings this DVD down. Sure I can skip to the good stuff but I shouldn't have to!Kids might enjoy this, though, because it has many characters featured, even if just for a glance. For other Mickey fans: get the ""Walt Disney Treasure: Mickey Mouse in Living Color"" DVD set, that looks much more promising... wait until Christmas Carol is featured by itself (maybe with the making of.. or some other special features). Do NOT buy this only for M's CC because the rest is annoying and of poor quality."
1,DONT BUY THIS VIDEO OR DVD!,"Not only was it very corny, but I expected to see alot of characters from my favorite Disney classics. Instead, Disney went and put a compilation of christmas shorts including the short story, ""Mickeys' Christmas Carol"", and rolled 'em all up into the ""new"" ""MICKEYS MAGICAL CHRISTMAS"". Its so OBVIOUS The Disney co. is going downhill with (aweful) movies like Atlantis, the Emperors New Groove, etc. Are they running out of ideas??? Look at the (aweful) ""direct to video"" sequals theyve made. Disney should just leave the great memory we have of their greatest classics, and leave 'em alone. When they make these ""direct to video"" sequals, they do nothing but leave a very bad taste in my mouth. The Little Mermaid 2 was a bomb. The worst! But anyways.....Please save your money from purchasing this video. I wish I did!"
1,Mickeys magical christmas,Mickeys magical christmas vcr tape was never received and and i have contacted seller twice now and nothing. i would like this taken care of either with the movie i ordered or a refund so i can order a different movie. thank you
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I can't say this video was all bad. I'm giving it a 3 because my almost-four-year-old does like it, but when I put in the DVD, the first thing he wants to see is the preview for the new Peter Pan movie that is coming out in Feb 2002.And if I wanted to see that much of Mickey's Christmas Carol, I'd watch Mickey's Christmas Carol!!!"
1,Holiday Rip-OFF,"Sorry to say that next to no thought went into this. Of course perhaps the target audience is the big pants crowd from Ohio, and I suspect so. Children naturally get excited to see these wonderful characters that Disney has passed down, too bad this seems to be an attempt to take advantage of that fact. Again, best left for the dummies in the Mid-West who don't know the difference. Very, very poor."
3,Literally joined together,I bought this necklace because I thought the hearts were separate but linked together. The two hearts are literally joined to make the illusion that its two linked hearts. The back is also craved in so it is not smooth like a regular open heart you usually see. The good thing about this necklace is that the hearts do lie flat on your neckline when you wear it and the chain is also a good length.
5,Logical & level headed,"The spiritual reasoning in this publication simply make good sense. I especially like the section ""Creation"" and ""Neutrality"". I found that when I need research on any particular subject matter, that the Reaasoning book directs me to the Bible using logic and common sense."
1,Incomplete product because of heavy edeiting.,"The Criticism I make isA/ About the product, it being incomplete and quite heavily and clumsily edited.B/ About your process and system response and management. In response to my complaint, you sent another copy(very efficiently and quickly),but the product was a copy of the initial incomplete one. this means no one took notice of the details of my initial complaint which actually detailed the missing scenes. So,you have a beautifully efficient system but one that lacks comprehension.I will continue trading with Amazon because you are very helpful, but every system needs an understanding and comprehending surviellance,not just a mechanical response.Regards,John and Veronica Arendse."
2,Expected more,I did get the book in time but its condition was not up to the level I expected in terms of the information that was provided for the book's condition at the time of purchase.
1,Nightmare Inducing!,"Totally agree with the other reviewers - this video is way too scary for anyone younger than elementary school. It has dark themes, with vultures, laser shooting bats, swordfights and people turned into stone. We had totally enjoyed some of the other Hello Kitty Paradise DVDs and came across this at Toys R Us. Heed the warnings!"
2,Too Spooky for Preschool,"I have purchased several of the Hello Kitty DVD/VHS selections for my children. This one is inappropriate for preschoolers. It is scary and has themes that are way too adult for this age group. Hello Kitty is generally very cute, innocent, sweet, and full of good lessons. This one is off of the beaten path for the usual Hello Kitty fair. Don't fear buying your children Hello Kitty - just check the content ahead of time by reading reviews. This one is definitely a leave alone video for the preschool set."
1,Cross-less Bible,"This has to rank with one of the more profound blunders in Bible publishing history. The central message of Christianity and the Bible is the cross of Jesus Christ. The central event in history is the cross of Jesus Christ. Without the cross you have no gospel and you have no Christianity. So why would a respected Christian publisher like Thomas Nelson omit the story of the cross in this Bible? I am dumbfounded. This Bible does contain the account of Jesus' resurrection, but without the cross there is no context in which to understand the resurrection. My children will not be reading this cross-less Bible."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book to introduce our children to reading the Bible on his/her own. I really like the format of the book. It has a theme verse, uses Bible verses to tell the stories and concludes with questions. However, when looking through the book, one thing stood out to me. The story of the cross is not included. It tells the stories of the Last Supper and the resurrection only. It also does not include the story of the Passover and Abraham and Isaac. It contains such stories as Josiah and Nebuchadnezzar eating grass. The story of the cross is the heart of the Gospel. This is why I have given the book a low rating."
2,No Cross?,"We love this Bible because 1) it uses actual scripture instead of the storybook paraphrasing that many of the children's Bible's use, 2) there is a memory verse at the beginning of each story, 3) the illustrations are very nicely done and help illustrate the story so that our children stay engaged, 4) there are good discussion questions at the end of each story. BUT I have to give this a low rating because the most important story--the Cross, the central message of the gospel--is missing! Why would they leave that passage out?I'd love to see a second edition of this book with that story included. I would give it 5 stars."
1,Waste of Money,"I called Sony and explained that my laptop was running through a battery before I could complete my workload. They said purchase the extended life battery and after its ""Breaking In"" period you should be able to run 6 hours on the battery. What they didn't tell me was that you have to have it running on minimum functions at half brightness of the screen, so on and so on. As it turns out the battery runs about 30 minutes longer than the original battery that came with the laptop. 30 minutes extra for almost $300???? Not worth it!"
3,Not as advertised,"The battery I finally recieved was a third party battery, not a SONY ORIGINAL as advertised. I have been satisfied with the performance of this battery though. The first time I recieved a battery, the packing slip had the one I ordered, but the one in the box was another model. I had to send that battery back, before they would ship the correct battery. This took an extra eight days after recieved the first battery. I sent the battery back the next morning after I recieved it. they did refund the shipping for having to send it back."
2,Not a Sony Product,"This item is advertised as a Sony VGP-BPL2.That is blatantly false. It is a Chinese knock off.I paid a premium to get what is advertised as a Sony product. If I wanted a clone, I could have bought a clone.I am still testing the battery to see how well it works.Shame on this vendor for a misleading product listing."
1,NOT a Sony battery - false advertising,"The battery I received from Power Direct is not a Sony battery, does not have the Sony name on it, does not have a serial number, and does not show the country of manufacture which is, I believe, illegal. Advertising this no-name battery as Sony is also false advertising. Before I noticed this I installed the battery but got a message that it was an incorrect battery, or not installed properly. The computer then hibernates while you reinstall the battery. Same result. I see several similar complaints and have to wonder why Amazon still allows them to advertise."
1,Don't buy it it wont work,This battery won't charge in my VGN-AR350. I don't know what to do with it now!
1,Not recommended.,"The battery lasts less then 1 hour. Expensive junk. Unfortunatelly, this type of battery is no longer available through Sony."
2,Last for a good 11 months then it died,"Brought it in Dec 2009, and it just died on me yesterday Oct 28, 2010. Somehow it cannot be charged anymore... Ordered a different one from another co. Will see if that works better."
1,Doesn't charge,This battery appears to match the one for my wife's laptop. However once installed the computer states that the battery is detected and WILL NOT charge.
2,Poor controls make this game a bust,"I love the NFS franchise and enjoyed NFS Underground on the PC immensely. The Wii version of NFS Carbon is a beautiful game, but sorely lacking when it comes to controls. The wiimote just doesn't cut it. Having previously had a steering wheel with accelerator which have now beeen replaced by the wiimote - this game is just a sad imitation."
4,Movie Like Racing Game with great graphics,"I recently got this game as a gift. I opened it up and put it into the wii. After the game loaded, I started a new career. I had to watch a movie for about 10 minutes that set me up with the plot, then right from the movie, the camera zoomed in and I was driving. It was really cool. The graphics where very realistic. At times, I had a hard time telling if I was watching film or graphics. The controller was responsive and after about an hour, I got the hang of it. I really like this game because it feels like your in a 2Fast 2Furuous movie."
4,Fun to pass time,"I Haven't really played that much bt seems fun and entertaining,I wish I would be at University again to have more time to spend playing."
5,Amazing Omg,This game is so good. It is the best game I have so far. I would recomend it to anyone that has wii. I would only get it for wii no other system.
4,Damn Fun!,"Having not played any car/driving games in quite a while, I thought I'd give NFS:C a spin. I was pleasantly surprised! The game is really fun. It's fast paced, has good action and can even be a little tense. Yeah, the controls feel awkward at first but after playing for a while you get a good feel for how to drive the cars. I'm driving much much better now than when I first started playing. I suggest starting with a ""tuner"" car like the Mazda RX-8, because the handling is much better and thus easier to drive."
2,Meh.,"This game is absolutely littered with ads! They are not only on the billboards you go by, you get ""text messages"" from T-Mobile. The story line is OK. The controls are clunky, unless you hold the A button while turning you won't be able to go around sharp curves (the oversteer control). If you turn the wheel too far while going around it will sometimes reset to 12 o'clock while your controller is still angled to turn. Without invoking the oversteer control the wheel will only turn from about 10-2 o'clock."
2,Pathetic experience... playing nfs on wii is really bad.,"i just got the game and played one night with it. It was disappointing. NFS 3 was much better than this. The graphics and concepts are probably ""better"" but getting the thing to respond correctly with the controller was almost impossible. So if you are buying this keep your expectations low."
3,Good but Not Great,I tried to like this game - I really enjoy racing games and I thought it would be fun with the remote to control the steering. It was somewhat fun at first but the story line and the controls eventually became tiring. A lot of things seem tacked on at the last minute. Even the manual was only a couple pages long and mostly black and white. I basically spent a lot of time trying to out run or ram into police cars. To me it's not worth the money that is currently being charged for it.
4,NFS delivers again!,"Actually 4.5 stars. It takes a while for you to get use to the controls. But once you get used to the 'Wii motes', the game play is a lot of fun. The game modes are really good with the Canyon mode delivering a lot of racing fun. The graphics and sound are good just like any other NFS game. However, I would have liked a little day light option in the game. Overall, a great racing game for the Wii."
4,Pretty good,"This game is not bad at all. I was pretty horrified from the controling. A little too nutty for me. But after I adjusted it, the controling turned out to be pretty awsome. And the story-line to the game is sweet."
3,Takes a while to get used to,"I must admit, I am not that good a player of the NFS. With that, this game takes awhile to get used to. Add to it the slow responsiveness of the game to the Wii remote, and sometimes you are puzzled what's happening on the screen. Unless you're pretty well experienced with NFS, don't go for the Wii version, would be my take."
3,Why so dark and gloomy??,"I'll admit for the first month I was hooked. But that was because of the races, nothing else. I hated the fact that it was never daylight.It was also always raining. Also, if you met one cop, then more were on you in a flash. Plus, in real you can't knock down ater towers w/ your car, especially without getting scratched. I just hope nfs nitro's graphics are better."
4,tough but fun,Not bad and easier on the hands using the WII controller compared to the normal Playstation controllers.Somewhat difficult controlling the car in some situations of racing...mostly the sprint races.
2,Worst racing game ever!,"This game is really dumb!It's not fun because the controls don't work, and it's almost impossible to steer. I turned this game in the day I bought it! The Wii rcing games are really bad and have poor controlls.At the place where I turned it in, this game(The one I turned in), and GT Pro Series (another Wii racing game), were the only 2 used Wii games there! That's how bad Wii racing games are. The only reason why I gave this game an overall 2 stars was because of the graphics"
1,Misleading Information,"I searched the Amazon site for a racing game that came with a steering wheel for Wii and thought that this game sounded like something my husband would like. Well, the game came. and lo and behold no steering wheel. I called amazon (good luck finding the number) and was informed by someone that could barely understand or speak English that I would not be getting the steering wheel with the game. So I now have to make an additional purchase because I already have the game. I have not yet gotten the game console and I hope to goodness that I do not have as much problem getting that order straight. There are other issues, but I will wait until all is said and done to comment... Do not depend on their search criteria!Need for Speed Carbon"
3,"Awesome graphics, poor control....................","The need for speed franchise seems to be a hit or miss with the NFS titles for PS2 were just awesome. Most wanted for DS wasn't so great and it seems that Carbon was a really good step for the WII graphic wise and concept wise, but it just feels like not enough effort was put into refining the controls. The controller is great to use in the situation of driving, (Try Excite Truck, you'll see what I mean!) so obviously the prospect of moving the controller in the steering wheel motion works out great. But I just could not get past the feeling of unresponsiveness from the controls. The storyline works really well and graphically, the game looks great. Maybe a little more technological refinement from EA would have sent this title to a higher level. If you're looking for a good driving game that is easier to play and exhibits more of a fun factor, I would recommend Excite Truck over NFS: Carbon."
4,Great Game,"I got this game a couple of days ago and already love it. Great features, so so story line (good for a game though), cops chasing u is also fun.As for the controls, it takes a little time to get used to them (for e.g. how much do you need to turn the remote for the cars to turn and all that) but once u do, it is so much fun. I had difficulty controling my car when i first played it but now since i have got a hang of it, i cant stop playing it.Would definitely recommend for those who love action packed racing games. And for 30 bucks its a pretty good deal as well."
4,Good...,"Like I said with the Need For Speed Pro Street, it's fun for the non-racers for about 3 seconds, but it's pretty intense for the racing game jockeys. It has different modes of game play, like you can free roam and get the cops mad (my favorite part), or just dive straight into the races. I may sound like I have a mixed idea with this, but I don't. The final verdict: I would get this game, but don't expect to stay with it until yo beat it."
4,Another Great Need for Speed,"This game adds to a great series. Great graphics, great tunes and great rides in a ""city conquering"" story mode. The only issue I am having is that I find it very difficult to drift, but I assume I need much more practice."
4,Caselogice UNP-2,We received the item which we ordered on time and as advertised. My wife was not disappointed. Thank you for the good service.
2,Buyer beware.,These are not live performances. The Quartet is miming to recordings. A major disappointment! Stick to the Cd's.
1,Non placer,"I am on my second reading of this book, a tortuous task of itself. The second reading is to see if the first reading was in fact valid. So far it is! Save your self the money and buy a local paper for same or similar information.The material is presented much as a ball in a pin-ball machine, bouncing erratically from issue to issue tied together with emotional appeals. I could find no religious, social, theological, educational or entertainment value!"
5,for anyone who has children in their life,"It would be easy for anyone who loves children to be in unending depression, given the hostility our society has against children. Arnold not only informs us of the many and varied forces destroying the childlike spirit, he gives us hope. Hope that even just one person, conciously making a positive effort will have an effect on the lives of the children around them. It is important that we never lose the faith that it's the small things that make the difference in a child's life, those things that everyone of us can still do. No eshausted mother, no overworked father, no unappreciated grandmother, no indifferent older sister or exasperated neighbor ever has the right to give up on a child. Endangered gives us positive advice on making those differences. This book should change the way you live your life."
5,Endangered: Your Child in a Hostile World - Reclaiming Childhood for Children,Johann Christoph Arnold guides the reader to a holy respect for children. He is a wonderful father and mentor with a depth of insight into the fundamental ills of modern society and their impact on children. His book is uplifting and puts life into perspective. An excellent read for any parent or teacher or leader of children.
4,What a great find!,I am a true lover of soundtracks. The movie was outstanding but to listen to the CD at your discretion is truly the best part. A definite great buy.
4,Excellent Martin House,"I bought the 24 room martin house. It is well designed and assembled very easily. However, people with poor mechanical capabilities should not buy this house because it requires some dexterity with a screwdriver.There are two minor flaws but both are easily corrected. The white rails are easily dislodged. They snap in place and I had to use glue to fix them permanently.There is no false roof for the top layer so it gets very hot in Texas. I cut out and added a hexagonal top insulated section between the top layer of nests and the external metal roof."
3,Not very sturdy.,"We were given this brand, Heath, as a gift two years ago. It did fine the first year. However, when we put it up for the second season, the perches and floors were loose. I have just seen that one of the ""apartment"" floors has fallen off as well as several perches. The fallen nest looked to be empty; I hope that was the case. I am now looking for a purple martin house for my brother, and I won't buy a Heath again."
3,Martin Birdhouse,"First, this takes a lot of work and patience to put together properly and the instructions are poorly written. Second, the rails the birds are supposed to sit on do not stay in place and are poorly designed. They do not fit well into the holes and keep falling off. If you buy this, be prepared to spend 2-3 hours putting it together and it will take 2 people at the same time for some of the steps."
1,Some assembly required,Very disappointing. a box of parts with marginal instructions. no where in the description of the product was this disclosed. value and cost do not relate at all.returned.
2,Can't put this together alone!,Not to mention razor sharp edges. Horrible instructions. The Martins love this style house and after our first house (we got already assembled from a friend) got damaged in a wind storm we decided to get a larger house. Wow just too much work.
4,great!,"It arrived on the last day, so a little bit late than I expected. I was worried about the quality of the watch since I read the poor comments which said the watch has cracks on it.In contrast, when I opened the box, it is beautiful, shiny, and come with the guess watch box.Great one, I like it so much , and start to wear a watch everyday."
1,Mad,"This was the worst purchase I ever made. The watch is scratch up really bad, and It doesn't even work. I don't think I will be buying anything off Amazon again."
2,Nothing Special,Just tells about a lot of bluffs using examples from actual hands. Problem is I have seen the same situations where it didnt work.
3,The secret is out,"Applying it is a whole different ballgame. This book just explains different situations when to bluff and how to go about doing it from the image your table sees you as. All pros bluff with timely fashion and this author is giving you a foundation as a pro himself how to do it yourself, all you need is courage. But like everything in life practice!practice!practice! If your a tight player thats sick of getting picked on by Mr bully this is the book to get. Overall I know skill will always outweigh luck in the long run, but it always helps to have every resource at your disposal in every situation and that is a good thing."
1,Bluffed into buying it,"My review is two thumbs down. It might help a total novice at the game, but it provides nothing for people who know anthing about poker."
1,unhappy,This book still has not been shipped to me. Thanks for the opportunity to tell folks how pitiful you are. I ordered it several months ago. I think you are supposed to ship it in another month. It is available now at many other places.
5,How to fill a big hole in your game.,"Bluffing is a fundamental part of poker. Without it we would all be at the mercy of the cards. That being said, it is also one of the most misunderstood and misused plays in the game. Real poker is a lot different than what you see on tv. If you wonder why you get called when you move in with 2-6 when it worked on the WPT, this book is for you.It goes through 49 different bluffs and tells you why they worked or why they didn't. It explains the things you need to look for when you make your move. It covers it all, your opponents style, chip stacks, positional bluffs (early and late position,) attacking weakness, and knowing when to abandon your bluff.It really helped me take my game to a higher level. I would say it is a must read for anyone who considers their self a student of the game of poker."
4,good series!,I am really liking this series. I do like that its not a romantic fairy tale style. it is not the best acting all the time but its good
4,Not the Same But Worth a look,"If you were looking for classic look again, this show so far has a few new twists that you should check out."
3,TOO MUCH SAMENESS,"The idea behind this show is a sound one and interesting. The only hitch is, that everyone is the same age, which is rather annoying and boring. It needs a bit more diversity."
4,Beauty and the Beast,"The show has great storylines and engaging characters with many dimensions, and also Jay Ryan is wonderful to watch as he is gorgeous!"
5,Unbelievably,I found that I really like this show even though I was halfway determined not to. Why? Because of the interaction between the leads. I find it oddly intriguing and want to find out more.
4,Great New Show!,"It's a great combination of the old show Incredible Hulk with a twist on the Beauty part. The Meerfield vendetta gets old quickly, but the chemistry between the actors is palpable thus making the show very worth watching."
5,Beauty and The Beast just as good the second time around!,I love this show and the characters! I was a huge fan of the 1993 series with Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman and this one is just as exciting and romantic! Cant wait to see how it progresses!
3,Take it or leave it,"It is not terrible, but I definitely was not left ""hanging"" at the end wanting to find out what happens next."
2,Couldn't get into this one,"Kristen continues to find acting that portrays her in the ""same old - same old"" fashion. Why did she pick the same old type of roll as she played in Smallville."
2,Not as good as the original television series,It's alright. I watched one episode but not too impressed. I enjoyed the older version a lot more. It is a little far fetched and complex from the original plot.
1,"If you were expecting anything close to the Ron Perlman/Linda Hamilton series, prepare for disappointment.","There isn't much new under the sun. Remakes seem to be the way of life in Hollywood nowadays. So when I heard there was going to be a reboot of a series my mother used to love and I used to watch with her because I was 10 and lion-faced guys were awesome, I made a mental note to watch it when it came out.I think I made a mistake. It was nothing like the original with a few name exceptions, and seemed to be geared more for the Twilight crowd than anyone who may have liked the original show.Rename it, and I probably wouldn't think it was so bad. But it definitely wasn't worth the time I spent watching it. I've watched infomercials at 3am with better acting and plots."
5,I find this show fascinating,"I really appreciate the way the two lead characters talk to each other about their hopes and fears, and interest in each other. The beast story line provides enough of an obstacle for them to overcome that the barriers to the relationship developing are external, rather than miscommunication or fear of being honest with each other - which a lot of other story lines rely on."
4,Beauty & the beast,"Entertaining/as usual these days tiny girls are beating the stuffing out of huge men, my husband' peeve/bit I like it"
3,First episode was good,I liked the first episode but the second one put me to sleep. I probably won't continue watching this series. There is a much better new show on the same network called Arrow.
2,Beauty & The Beast,Beauty & The BeastNot excited about the plot or acting. Also cannot afford to pay to see episodes missing from free streaming.
1,UNREALISTIC,"This show was terrible! The main character was a detective that did not follow a single rule! She walked into a building without a warrant and stole evidence from a suspects desk. And still solved the case without a single glitch or conflict. Another disappointment was the connection between the detective and the ""beast"". They were already into each other and expressing thier feelings for each other even though they have known each other for a total of 5 hours. If I had to sum up this first episode in one word it would be UNREALISTIC!!!"
4,I Like this show much more than I thought I would,"I was/am a huge fan of the original Beauty and the Beast TV show and was quite hesitant to even get involved with this one. However, when it won the People's Choice award, I thought I'd give it a try. Other than the names, this series is absolutely nothing like the first series. I miss the fantasy of the underground tunnels and underground society but this present day B&TB has it's own rewards. The actress that plays Catherine is a very good actress, a strong, capable detective yet with plenty of chemistry with Vincent. A good series that I'm not sorry I bought. I hope it gets renewed."
5,Awesome! Season One Beauty and the Beast,Love this show - it has a little something for everyone. Law and Order type crime drama with a love story and a little sci-fi thrown in for good measure. Series gets better with each episode!
5,"Intelligent, thought provoking, well researched and written","Having been a dieter all my life, this book reminded me that the diet industry is a business. Ms. Fraser left no stone unturned in going to all sources such as diet centers, doctors, pills, shakes, research people, exercising etc. At the end I decided there wasn't any need to continue on the roundabout and stay obsessed with my weight when I could be getting on with better things in my life. Consequently I've lost 15lbs since reading the book!!! Because I chose to get off the merry go round of dieting and give my money to a more worthy cause."
2,Great subway reading,"While this book is interesting to read, written in a prose style that keeps one reading, and flows logically through a wonderful historical framework, I felt at the end of every chapter that the author should have done a more thorough job. He should have developed his theses more, provided more depth to his topics, and offered information that is less general and more useful. This is an excellent introduction to the history of cocktails and drinking in the United States, but as a useful research tool, ""The Cocktail"" is of little value. But, as a strong point, I doubt that there are historical errors in the book - Lanza did do some research, that much is certain. But I still have the inclination that Lanza wanted to get another book in print without having to strain too hard writing it. I give this book two stars under the assumption that two stars means ""okay reading for the subway"", and one star ratings are solely for romance novels."
1,"Wordy and obtuse, Mr. Lanza's book is a big disappointment.","I bought this book thinking it would be a fun look at how social drinking has influenced and shaped our society. What I got was a glorified undergrad sociology essay that tries too hard to impress with syntax, but only succeeds in boring the reader. Take my advice, skip this one."
1,Not accurate,"From reading the other reviews, I wonder if we are reviewing the same product. After having no success tuning from the pitch pipe, I checked it against both a piano and an electronic tuner and found out why. The C pipe was flat by 23 cents, The others were closer but not much. Buy a good tuning fork and don't waste your money on this."
1,Not worth the money,This pitch pipe plays a flat pitch. I've had much better luck tuning to a short online recording. I will probably return it.
2,Better than doing it by ear and humming,"This was disappointing. These are very cheaply made and not very reliable. My first pipe had the G reed stuck so it made no sound. I called the vendor and they sent me another one. It is OK, has a little rattle at A, and is a little quiet on G, but it is passable.I ended up grabbing my electronic tuner from my cello and I use that to tune my ukulele.All in all, not my most favorite purchase, but better than a sharp stick in the eye."
1,why would you need this?,totally stupid i dont understand even what its sposed to do... it doesnt make noise to help you tune your ukulele.. maybe if i knew how to use it properly id understand it and like it better but it doesnt come with instructions either!
1,False information,"I won't even buy this book because in browsing the exerpt, I found a significant fallacy. The United States is NOT a democracy. It is a Republic. Big difference and one we should all understand. Go back and read your constitution...or better yet, learn the Pledge of Allegiance."
4,concise seated practice,"I appreciate the concise nature of this dvd, divided into 2 half hour segments: strength building and restorative. The first segment is a seated flow that focuses on building core strength. It is a stand-alone segment that leaves you feeling relaxed. The pacing is quick enough that you stay engagedI typically practice a standing flow but enjoyed the change in staying grounded. The second segment is good for days when you are looking to unwind but don't have much energy to spare. I enjoy Rodney Yee's style of teaching, flowing through postures, his even voice and the scenery--orange striped rocks of Arizona. I think this dvd is good for all levels but targets intermediate practitioners."
3,"Good Abs Supplement, but not gonna get the job done on its own.","This is a good supplement to an ab routine--maybe to use the day after an intense Pilates workout. I only did the strength routine, which I didn't find to be especially strengthening (and I'm only in average shape--not a fitness freak), but like Yee says in the Intro, the workout is more focused on creating a ""supple"" midsection. Plus, since stress can contribute to belly fat, the stress-relieving element of the workout may be beneficial."
1,TOO SIMPLE,YOGA- CORE CROSS TRAIN dissapointed me. It's too simple and repetitve.I reccomend the dvd strengh and flexibility better.
4,Fun book with lots of content,"We ordered this book after coming across it at the library and loved it. It's not a board book, so you wouldn't want to turn your toddler loose with it. Nevertheless, I love the style of the illustrations and the simple words that accompany them. It's perfect for story time with a 12-18 month who is beginning to repeat words and build his or her vocabulary."
3,It will keep you entertained but...,"(...) I love lizzie's tv serius, it is awsome so don't get me wrong on this review. This game is entertaining for like a long trip. I thought most levels were kinda hard and boring. And on top of it i payed $30 for a game that was only 2 and a-half hours long. So if you want a really fun game i would pick up kim possible. If you are not convinsed enough then at least rent the game before you buy it! Don't make the same mistake i did!"
2,stay away...!!!,"Ok, I was so exited when I got the game. The first level in the first part wich takes place in school is very fun. the second level in the first part was so difficult,trust me. My uncle had to do it for me (he is very good in video games)and it was even difficult for him. The third level in part one was a little bit fun again, but difficult. Part 2 all the games were Ok and some of them were fun. In the 3rd part the first level is not difficult but boring. The second level in part 3 is soooooo dificult (and if I say difficult I mean difficult), I think it's impossible. And because I didn't make the the second game in the 3rd part (there are only 3 parts)I coudn't play the third game (wich is the last game in part 3, because you have to finish the game befor you can go to the next game)and that sucks.Anyway I just gave this Lizzie game 2 points in all because some of the games were kind of fun."
2,Stinky,This game is the worst game I beat it in one night and there is only 3 levels I wouldn't have spent $30 on it if I knew how much the game stunk. My advice is don't spend $30 on it.
3,Good book if you don't mind weak females.,"Overall, I think the book was okay. It had its moments, but I think Beth let Jake get away with too much. How quickly she forgot the reason she was married to him in the first place. Why do the female leads always fall victim to the mans kisses. No matter how hard they try they just can't seem to laugh in a mans face after he tries to dominate her using his sex appeal. Maybe, I'm just tired of weak female characters. For once, I'd like to see the male character brought to his knees without somehow turning to tables on his leading lady. Other than Beth being a total wimp, I'd say the book is pretty good."
3,Let's not get to hyperbolic here....,"Hooker is a very good book; I too couldn't put it down until I was finished with it. I didn't like, though, how Thesz took so many potshots at men who weren't around to defend themselves. Argentina Rocca and Buddy Rogers are the two best examples. Was Rocca a simpleton? Probably, but was it really necessary to devote an entire chapter to what a clod he is? Rogers makes one offhand comment about Thesz's mentor, and Lou carries the grudge until the day he dies. That's not a sign of strength of character, Lou, that's self aggrandizement in it's most insidious form. Certainly the author is going to shine himself up to be the greatest he can be when he writes his own autobiography. I just think it would have been a better piece if he concentrated more on his own exploits and less on bashing others who didn't pass the Hooker's test."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I'm a wrestling buff, and I thought I'd love this book. But the lack of pictures weakens it severely. And scant if any attention is paid to such important issues as sexuality in wrestling; use of drugs or alcohol; family life; dealings with fans; how certain holds are applied, etc. Instead, most of the book seems to concentrate on the business angle--whose promotion was pushing whom, how much people got paid, and other matters that I didn't find that interesting."
5,"An traditional, memorative view of wrestling history.","In this book, Thesz gives an honest, open and interesting view of professional wrestling from an old timer's view point. Thesz was a reknowned ""hooker"", being that he was capable enough in the ring to actually destroy an opponent if need be, and has no qualms with giving the truth behind many figures in history. Ironically, you'd think he hated those deemed ""performers,"" or those who were simply acters instead of accomplished amateurs or hookers, yet he seems to have been open-minded enough to realize that for the big money to occur, things had to change.Thesz is a very open and honest person and I'd suggest this book to any wrestling fan who truly wants a good insight to the roots of professional wrestling through the 20th century."
5,A Championship book written by THE Champ,"""Hooker: An Authentic Wrestler's Adventures Inside the Bizarre World of Professional Wrestling - The Biography of Lou Thesz"" arrived late yesterday. Really impressed by the absolute honesty & integrity. The comparisons to other professional sports were perfect, as were descriptions of amateur wrestling, athleticism required -especially that Joe Louis couldn't handle it- and Red Smith's shocked reaction to fixed boxing match and his apology to Lou - Wow this is great stuff about a one in a hundred million athlete, his extraordinary career and times, a misunderstood sport and America-a great story well written-- perhaps best sports story I've ever read - you really must respect and appreciate the man and it was all done in sincere humility and with thanks and recognition to all who are part of the story. This will become a benchmark for quality sports tales and certainly help bring a more positive attitude toward wrestling."
2,Does NOT Work with 64 bit Windows,Be forewarned. There is no mention by Amazon that Math Blaster Algebra does not work with Windows 64bit. My daughter and I spent hours trying to find a fix researching the publisher's web site and talking with their customer support. We finally gave up and returned the CD to Amazon.
5,REVIEW OF SHELF SLIDES,I HAVE USED BLUM SHELF SLIDES IN THE PAST. THEY ARE AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT AT A REASONABLE PRICE.
1,this game stinks,"if your looking for a fun game that can keep your attention for more than 5 minutes then this game is not for you. i got this game for my sweat 14th birthday and i was so excited, because i love raven, but when i popped this game in my g.b.a. i was so disapointed it was boring and i beat it within the first half an hour and that was it, its easy and its the same rutine as all the other nock-offs so save your money and get an origanal somthing that hasnt been done, or throw your money in the trash with another one of the same games in your collection."
3,"Good, but not the totally Raven awesome",It was okay but I think it could be a little more enthusiaatic.
4,the funiest game ever,i like the tv series so the game should be fine. i havent played it but i will buy it. if you dont buy it you are some sort of anti social
3,I hate this game,"This is a game for 5 year old kids, that know how to play a Game Boy. It is so easy. I finished it the hole game in 3 hours. I bought it with my own money, and when I played it, I was so mad. I bought it because I love the shows but it turns out that I hate the game."
5,oh my gosh OMG u guys r so dumb!!?,"this game is so great cause I love the show. eye have never played the game, but I am somehow writing a review! I like the part where something strage happens to raven and she gives this hilarious look into the camera cause she just KNOWS something is fishy. HAHAHA LOL. thats really iz so raven.?! LOL OMG"
5,Really super,"This was amazingly simple to use and worked great, no solder just cut your pipe and snap in place. Would buy more. Fast ship good communication."
1,"terrible, fails after a few months","I put two of these in, for hot and cold feeds to my laundry room. They are very easy to install compared to solder type valves.However, one failed immediately. It had a defect in the seal. I got it replaced, and the new one worked fine.Five months later, one failed, spraying lots of water out of the seal around the incoming pipe. I could get it to stop by pushing the pipes into the valve, but as soon as I let go, it would leak again.I will never buy any plumbing device with this kind of ""bite"" connector ever again."
2,Disappointed,"The Peruvian inca aji, is not as described,it is not pure Aji, has added spices not used on all peruvian dishes"
5,Acoustic guitar the way it should be played,"Will Brady's album, Boxwork, is a beautifully crafted collection of acoustic guitar interpretations. Much of it is improvised, though every note seems selected with precision, and played with a master's touch. You can feel the emotion flowing through his fingers. If you enjoy beautiful guitar finger picking, this is an album well worth the money."
2,NMS CD,"This CD may have had a lot of good practice questions, but I'll never know since I couldn't stand the format. Answers to the questions are provided, but they are long-winded and address a whole block of questions (not just the question you are working on). The display is too small to display all the choices, making it difficult to compare answers. If you're looking for a practice CD that simulates Step I conditions, this isn't it."
3,The Tiger woods PGA Tour 07,It is a good game but could be a bit easyer on the swinging part of the game and could be a bit bettar grafics.
3,Big TWPGA fan,"I enjoyed TWPGS2K3. This has everything locked down. Why should I have to BUY a SWEATER for my player for $15,000 that will... Improve my driving accuracy???I despise lunacy like this. do the EA guys play actual golf??If the guys that made the MS Links games ever make a golf game... Id switch.Having said that, its a fair way to pass the time on PS3. Just dont pay full price."
2,"I love the Tiger Series, but they took out all the good courses","Tiger Woods is by far my favorite game of all time, but for the PS3 version they took out all the challenging courses and the tiger tees. If you play the game for a while and get really good at it, even on the hardest difficulty settings, the regular PGA courses are no challenge. The whole fun in the game is playing these rediculously hard, exotic courses and trying to master them. I pray that these courses return for 2008."
5,the best $15 I've spent on a game,"I bought this game about a year or two after it was first put out, and at this point it had been replaced by newer versions, so it could be had for cheap. I didn't open it for a few months, getting bored with some of the glitzier titles I had bought for my PS3. Since opening Tiger Woods 07, though, I've consistently played it and enjoyed it. Easy to learn, tough to master, it has just the right level of difficulty and replayability for a game of its type. I don't even watch golf, let alone play it, but since playing this game I've caught a few minutes here and there on television and I can actually appreciate it. There is no need to buy a newer, more expensive copy of Tiger Woods than this, if you own a PS3."
3,Little control over swing,"Just ok, but not absolutely dissappointed; kind of a nostalgic feel.Good profile build feature, though time consuming."
2,very weak,"Well, this is probably their worst album ever. It looks like if they had put together some old and new stuff that were not good enough to go on the other albums. Yet you can still find two or three songs that are worth listening to but 2-3 out of 15 is not a quite convincing score...Far far behind come clean, young and good looking and their classical album blood, guts...Better wait for the next one."
1,Sux,"""Come Clean"" is on of my favorate albums.There are a couple good trax on this CD.I don't like rap, I don't like bands that play rap, I don't like people who listen to rap.I took a sharpie and wrote ""Sux"" on the CD and glued it to the wall."
4,Good Value,"This is the best collection I've seen too lock in a strong collection of 2nd Wave Ska. It's all strong stuff. The draw back is if you alreadly own a lot of varity Ska CD's your going to get a LOT of duplication. I figure I alreadly have 1/3 to 1/2 the tracks on this collection in other Ska CD such as Ska-ville UK, SKAndalous, Dance Craze, Ska Down with Her and Runin Naked thru the Cornfield. Not to mention the orginal albums. But at the price who can knock 64 tracks and close to 4 hours of skanking Ska. This is your best buy if your new to Ska and not a bad buy if your a serious collector."
5,"The Beat Moves The Feet, But Please Listen And Learn","Ska has broken down so many social barriers through great rhythms coupled with lyrics that oftentimes gave a worldly view to the political frustrations in the crowded city streets.This collection is four disks with 64 tracks and clocks in at a whopping 210 minutes, with music from the 1960s to the 1980s. The fourth CD is live performances by a variety of artists, including the Big 5, International Beat, Special Beat and one of my favorites - The Selecter.It is difficult to get a grasp on the historical - and continuing - impact of ska due to many bands during this time period being recorded on small labels, which has made it virtually impossible to find some material on CD's.At the list price and for its comprehensiveness, Ska Wars is a great beginning for those who want to groove to the beat for the first time or for fans looking to make a wise purchase for their collection."
5,A little gem,"Another excellent secret series book that covers must of the essential dermatological facts that must be known by any health care provider. It includes lots of good quality photographs and interesting facts. Certainly, this book is worth the time and the money."
2,just ok,"This book is great if you are going into dermatology and you want to read it cover to cover. If you are a medical student rotating in dermatology but going into something else this book is not as good. During your rotation you will see a condition and then look it up in your handy book. This book is written to give overview on general concepts but is not as good if you want to know everything about one subject. Several times I have looked up a condition in the index only to find that it is either not in the book at all, or it is talked about in 5 different chapters without one central entry on the condition."
5,"On a night just like this, one year ago...","I veer toward dark fiction, I love lit-horror novels, I'm a Halloween freak and already was a Stewart O'Nan fan and admirer (is ""O'Nanism"" too lewd?). So, yeah, this book worked for me. The incantatory opening is among the best openings to a novel I've ever read. From there it just got darker and more poignant. Like Jaws or, say, Ninety-Two In The Shade, you know where it's going, and you flinch the whole way and then when the inevitable does happen you're still breathless with shock.O'Nan should be a household name. His body of work is amazing and The Night Country is a wonderful organ of that corpus. Highly recommended if you like that alchemy of Literature and Story that only O'Nan can deliver in a seamless package. Wow."
4,a great story,"I live in Avon Ct, and this book captures my town perfectly. It is not that i live in Avon that i love this book, it really is moving and powerful, without being too sappy and unreal. It sort of takes a very real situation, a deadly car crash on old farms road, and shows how much the living and dead are effected by the tragedy. i read this book any time i had the chance because it was so phenomonal. it is a quick read, but it leaves lasting impressions. powerful book. i recommend this book, if you have ever lived in a small suburb, you can understand this book."
2,It just left me not caring....,"I have a hard time understanding the great reviews for this book. I'm an avid reader of many different authors and while I can see O'nan has a gift for writing true-to-life dialogue, I found myself simply not caring about the story or any of the characters. They were written a bit too thin. I finally stopped around page 150. It felt more like work than pleasure to read it."
4,"Sad, evocative story","This sad, evocative story suffers somewhat in the obviousness of its conclusion, but still features much of the rich, insightful writing which has become O'Nan's trademark. Most moving is what isn't said: the silences amid the reactions of Danielle's ghost to Tim's behavior express much about the inability of love ultimately to help us overcome our own solitude, and the geometries of grief transform the lives of survivors in terrible ways.Don't misunderstand: this is not a horror novel, but a representational mosaic of what we lose when those we love die. I can't help but compare it to The Sweet Hereafter, by Russell Banks, which actually may be better even if only because it doesn't rely on the presence of ghostly narrators to frame its observations. Both are terrific."
5,The best Wah wah!!!,I've purchased this item last month and all I have to say is.... awesome! The effects with this pedal are excellent.
5,Mounting Bar is Nice!,The mounting bar was easy to install and a great idea for families who prefer to have the child in front of them on the bike but not on the handlebars.I bought two of them one for my bike and one for my wifes' bike so we can take turns riding the baby all we have to do is swap the carrier from one bike to the other without having to take the bar apart.
3,pouring light,"Nice pictures etc. Unfortunately too many pages devoted to the usual materials, value studies, thumbnails, how to use masking fluid .... Technique begins on pages 68-69"
5,Pouring Light,"Marvelous book on the technique of pouring watercolor paint instead of the traditional way of painting. Well written, Jean is so talented - it's inspiring."
4,Waaaugh of art,"Who'd have thought it. Decades after the darkest and funniest mainstream comics-book character was banished to the outer limits by that film, he's back and hasn't lost any of that world-weary invective and sarcasm we love.Gerber's got a lot to say about the state of the consumerist world we live in and there's plenty of targets to have fun with.The artwork is excellent, especially Fabry's contribution.I'd give it 5 stars but it's too damn short."
5,"Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?",C'mon.. this is Dirty Harry... and im the greatest box I've ever seen... worth every cent.. if it only came with a magnum...
4,Dirty Harry,"I really enjoyed watching Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry, again. The only thing I did not like was I was unable to put on subtitles even though it was blu ray."
5,Great!,I bought this collection for my dad. He loves it and has watched it several times. I would recommend this to anyone.
4,Dirty Harry Ultimate Collector's Edition,"Everyone should already know the plot to these movies, so I will tell you why I rated these a 4 instead of a 5. The Transfer to Blu-Ray was soft. I saw very little difference between a regular upscaled DVD and the Blu-Ray edition. I watch it on a 60 inch 1080P Sony, which really upscales with excellence."
5,Excellent,"I ordered this for my husband's birthday. He has been wanting this series for quite some time. I only had a few days to get it. It came on time and he was thrilled. Thanks Amazon. Everytime I have ordered anything from you, it has been of the best quality and arrived timely.Sincerely,Yolanda"
4,Dirty Harry,"It's great to have all the Dirty Harry movies, but the extra stuff that comes with it is really kinda cheesy and unnecessary."
4,dirty harry dvd collection,"Box arrived a bit damaged, but that could be the fault of the Post Office by the way it was jammed in my mailbox. Good news is the product is in good shape. thanks!"
1,Too much SEX for a Teenager!,Clint Eastwood is greatBut we bouth this for our 15 year old son. Way to much sex in there! We sold it after he watch one video!
5,Definitely worth the money,The remastered films look and sound fantastic! I could do without the little wallet and badge but the included booklet describing each film and it's actors is really nice. Definitely worth the money and a fine addition to my collection.
4,For Dirty Harry Fans,"Sat down on a Saturday and watched the entire collection. Reminded me of why I have always been a fan of Dirty Harry Callahan. Picture quality was decent and sound was straight out of the periods the movies were shot, although clear and crisp."
3,Widescreen or not?,"Is this set in widescreen or TV format? Only 1 review I've seen mentions that it's widescreen, but the set's description lists the format as being 1:33."
5,Dirty Harry's Ultimate Collector's Edition,This is a great gift! Very well put together and all of the extras are perfect for a Clint Eastwood lover!
4,My son loves it!,We bought this one over our family vacation time because we stayed at hotel without TV. My son loves it! He watched all of them within 2 days.
5,Makes me want to buy a Smith!,"If you like his police movies, you sure need this set. Has all is best. The only bad think was, it made me want to buy a Smith like his, in 45 Colt."
5,WOW!,"What a bargain! $60 is a major bargain for what you get. In addition to the DH movies, you get a lot more cool memorabilia inside. I kept finding more things as I dug in there. How cool is this? A wallet with an inspector badge, a case file which is really neat, pics, books, etc. Even if you have the original DVDs...get this box set!"
4,Great movie but.....,I would buy the DVD set if it wasn't widescreen. I for one don't like widescreen because of the black spaces at the bottom & top. If the disk has standard on one side & widescreen on the other I would buy it.
1,Very disappointed - no subtitle and no closed caption,"I looked into this DVD set and I discovered that there is no subtitle and no closed captions in all Dirty Harry DVD collection. We are extremely upset with these great shows without any subtitle/closed captions. Clint Eastwood must be a bigotry man against non-English people and hearing impaired people who need to read what their says. FIX THESE DVDS TO ADD SUBTITLE OR GO AHEAD, MAKE MY DAY!!!"
1,Save money by buying them at Walmart.,"I only Rated this Item one star due to price......The content of these Movies are well worth $114, But why pay premium price for media now days Save more at Walmart, I just paid $10 for Dirty Harry/Magnum force and $10 for The Enforcer/Sudden Impact at walmart...they have them in double feature Blu Rays, Im sure even if Dead Pool Cost $20 then you will still be saving $80....."
4,Ultimate sixties cockney mod rock statement,"It's so good to see most reviewers getting the point of this album. The Small Faces were never meant to be compared with other bands. They were simply there, in their own inimitable cockney idiom. Ogden's Nut Gone Flake was a statement for the time, full of bouncy English humour, good musicianship, and meant to be enjoyed by an audience who had been through the Carnaby Street thing with them , or had fought on the beach at Brighton on the bank holiday, and who lived in a grey depressing terraced-house suburbia.The trick is not to apply excessive analysis, but to accept the LP for what it actually is, a piece of late-sixties pop culture beautifully executed by guys who were living the whole experience at the time; ..........'nuff said!"
2,way too complicated!,"if youve got your own lab and some good glassware and a firm chemistry knowledge and you want to experiment then this book is for you. but if you just want to make some hash oil, then there are easier (and safer) ways than described in this book. save your $$ and search google for ""+BHO 'butane honey oil'"" insted of buying this book."
1,not what I was looking for,very old info .its not necesscary to make hash oil too complicated.only buy if you are like me an have to have every book about a subject.more of a pamphlet than a book
4,Great gift!,"We had been looking for a pair of locking jaw pliers to complete the tool set we were giving our son for Christmas. We saw this set and it was priced lower that some single pliers we saw. We ordered it and it came very quickly, and was just what was promised. Our son loves them and has used them already. I feel we got a great deal!"
2,Was the editor on vacation?,"I wanted to enjoy this book, but the lack of good editing and the lack of continuity between mini-stories hurt the pleasure of reading the few good sections.At one point, we were being told a story, about a story, of a story, of a story about a legend. The larger problem is that the author switches narrators, place, and time without any change in style. So the language and structure used by an Indian's mother is the same as a Pittsburgh banker.Clearly the author is often writing about things outside his experience."
4,Boot,"Boot, the Wings great right wing is great crusing the margins and sneaking in a shot when least expected. But midway body checking is allowed. Boot will not hit and he is the only one on the team that is being creamed. Will he hold back as long so he doesnt get respect or even worse lose his place on the Wings?"
3,"It's almost the same as ""7 weeks live in America"".","If you have ""7 weeks in America"", it doesn't worth buying this one, because they were recorded at the same presentations."
4,What it Means to Be a Wolverine,"It you ever admired Ohio States rivals this would be a great book for you. It is spiced up with rosters from the four magicians to the famous wide receiver Braylon Edwards. I enjoyed this book because I like college football and its history. The are many more reasons I like this book, but I'm only going to list three. I like Michigan football and its players. I enjoyed all the accomplishments of the Michigan alumni. For the final suggestion I thought this would be a great book for the Michigan football players from the past and present. You could also see if you were one of Michigan's best athletes. By reading this popular piece of writing you could remember how exciting your years in college were."
4,"very, very nice cookbook","My husband purchased this book for me for christmas...(after I had made 500 cookies for gifts)...i have only had an oppurtunity to try out one of the recipes...it was for chocolate chip cookies...i followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out cakey...i like cookies that taste like cookies not like cake...otherwise it is a great book...there are many pictures and the recipes are very, very simple...(i am not much of a cook)...the oatmeal cookies look like they will be yummy...i am really excited to try more of these recipes"
4,Cute feminine hoodie,"This is a very lightweight feminine hoodie. It runs small, so order one size larger that you prefer. I normally wear 8-10, ordered a medium and it was much too small to go over the top of anything else. A little over priced for such a lightweight jacket, but I guess that's the ""Broncos"" logo you're paying for."
3,pretty good but has some faults,"The book starts off so well with great written instructions and clear diagrams. However, the author too quickly abandons the beginner by shortening the written directions and cutting out parts of the diagrams which we've supposedly already learned. Also, he states in the beginning that the shaded sides of the diagram will indicate which side of the paper you're looking at (most paper is white on one side and colored on the other) but only in the first diagram and in a few other advanced ones does he do this. Plus, I believe that he starts a few off wrongly by telling the wrong side of the paper to start with.On the good side, the structures quickly build off of the folds of the previous one so you can master various folds and apply them to the next. The beginner form, the mouse, is really cute. Not a bad book on origami but I believe I'll need to add another book to my collection in order to get further along."
3,Beginners Beware!,"Robert J. Lang is probably the most famous origami artist alive. His approach to origami transcends the simple craft aspect and has helped elevate it to a true fine art. This book was his first publication and it came at a time when the art of diagramming was still coming of age. Thus the diagrams can be a bit difficult to follow. In addition, it is only recently that Dr. Lang has devoted most of his time to the simple square so many of these models are produced from very odd rectangles which must be painstakingly measured and cut.This book might be a good choice for the collector or fairly advanced folder, but certainly not for the beginner."
5,Original,"The pace of this book is well-designed. From the easiest model to the very-much amazing and complicated cucu-clock. Mr. Lang show us possibilities of origami here, many models are from non-square papers. Most models are vivid and beautiful, for example, the dragonboat, cucu-clock, cicada. However few models are not so attractive, for example, cellist, violinst."
2,a weird and expensive book,"at the first reading this one looks interesting but don't be fooled!this book is filled with strange,ugly and really difficult models with at least only four or five good looking onesthe 3D section is a waste of ime,with poorly designed modelsexcept for the scorpion the cicada and the tarantula(the challenge of my life)the other cool part are the musicians, but the pianist is just impossible to be done,as the other advanced models,like the cuckoo clockwell I think that's better you chase some models on the web than buy this book"
3,Not my favorite,"This book isn't bad. What I don't like about it is that the instructions are all at the bottoms of the pages instead of having each step's diagram near the text. There are some pretty tough models, which is a fun challenge, but also frustrating. Some get so complex that the paper gets difficult to fold any further."
3,The Complete Book of Origami: Step by step instructions.,"It's okay. Some of the foldings were difficult for me and I purchased the book to work with my grandson, trying to help him learn,"
2,Was hoping for more,"Bought this book hoping it would be good to get started with, but the directions aren't very clear and neither are the diagrams, even in the beginning. Disappointed but going to keep trying."
4,Definitely not for beginner origami folders unless you're diligent!,"I haven't tried folding all of the models that are included, but this book offers step by step diagrams with written directions at the bottom of the page, which can be helpful for people who aren't as visual. The diagrams are just lined diagrams, so there is no shading or color to further help folders. I like the organization of the book, which includes basic folds, advanced folds, 3D origami, and action origami."
2,Stainless steel whisk,Much lighter in weight than I expected. Smaller handle than shown.flimsy.amnot sure if it will whisk heavier batters to desired consistency.
4,yummy and low sugar,I like these (esp the Mixed Nuts) because they have less sugar than protein. So many bars out there nowadays have double the sugar than the protein in them and it's just not worth it to me.I originally went on the Belly Fat Cure diet which required you have 5g sugar per meal and no more. Some bars had 0g sugar and worked well but definitely did not taste as good as these. These have 7g sugar so it's a little bit of a compromise but definitely worth it for the taste.Note that this product contains soy though so take that into consideration. My doctor said soy can mess with the thyroid if ingested in large quantities.
1,Stale,"Should buy these at the store instead of online. Expiration date says October, but these taste stale aleady. Other reviewers have indicated that theirs tasted stale, also. Will be sending back."
2,power failure,I ordered 3 types of Power Bar. None of them tastes fresh. The expiration date isn't until September (it's June now) but I think these bars are stale. I won't be reordering.
1,Tastes like cardboard,The bars are dry and tasteless. Like a year old rice crispie treat. Nasty and stale.
3,Bar is good but quality control is poor,"I've been enjoying these bars for a while since I really like the nutritional profile. However, the syrup they use for flavoring tends to clump on the bottom of most bars, which makes each bite too sugary for me. They're great when they look like the picture on the box, but that only happens about 30% of the time."
3,Taste is ok,"I got it for a good price ordering recurring shipment. However, I would like to try someother for taste. The taste is just ok to me."
5,Pieces of a Song: Printed Divinity,"To say that this collection of poems is ""delightful"" would be the understatement of the decade. Diane DiPrima quickly knocked her way up to being one of my favorite poets in the space of 5 days (the time it took for me to read this book !). These poems are bohemian and contemporary. They're forlorn in a controlled way, romantic but smirking, and strong willed. DiPrima truly outdid herself penning every word."
3,daily reading,"I had hope this would of been more on a life lessons not a book on daily bible verses. My brother says he likes it, so it is his to read."
5,Think better Live better... start in the morning,I have had this book for 20 years and it has been with me on the days that I have wanted to become more as a human. It is insightful and quick enough to fit in every day. Jump start each day with healing and centered thoughts with this book as help.
5,The Promise of a New Day,"All I am wanting to say, is that, this book was given to me by my best friend, my Mum, in January 1998. It is such a God-send. I will treasure it for all my days. It is a shame that it is out of print - it is such a perfect book for daily reflection, that quite often is poignant to the day. It is my favourite, and the leather binding with the bible textured paper is most appropriate. I cannot speak highly enough of this book, its messages move me so deeply, to the point of tears. Those who wrote and illustrated it, are so in touch with the deeper essence of life - God bless their souls. Please, if you can, pass on my heart-felt gratitude. Now that I have discovered the other books they have written, I shall be checking them out. May God truly bless you and shower you all with such profound Love. Thank You."
4,Excellent,"I don't think we as human beings actually recognize the power of daily reading, meditation, and reflecting. Practicing these powerful principles allows us to remain mindful of the moment and reflect upon the deeper question in our lives. To devote ourself to a daily meditation and to journal on these quiet times is priceless and will certainly aid in the evolution of our soul. For me this practice has allowed an awakening to take place and opens my life up to all the opportunities that are available in this universe. Please give this practice a try! This book will help you in your journey of living and cultivating an active consciousness in your daily life.Richard A. Singer Jr. Author Your Daily Walk with the Great Minds of the Past and Present."
1,DID YOU RECIEVE IT!,"THIS IS THE SECOND ORDER I PLACE FOR THIS BOOK. I NEVER RECEIVED THE FIRST ONE...AND THIS ONE, PLACED ON NOVEMBER 25TH IS ON THE SAME TRACK. MY SIS LEAVES FOR ANTARTICA TOMORROW...AND YES i AM YELLING. THIS WAS A GIFT FROM A DEAR FRIEND, AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT GIFT FOR MY SISTER TOO, BUT NO, SHE DID NOT GET. THANKS AMAZON FOR RUINING IT!"
5,Excellent Documentary,Chosin is an excellent documentary that provides insight into the Korean War from the perspective of the brave men who were at the Chosin Reservoir. It is difficult to imagine the conditions under which this war was fought. The documentary captures the essence of the experience without being overly graphic. The Korean war is barely mentioned in most history courses. I highly recommend this documentary for teenagers and adults.
5,the neice of a fallen Chosin hero,"just recently discovered my uncle, William E. Cavender, was listed as MIA. He was killed at Chosin. I never met him, as I was not yet born, but am truley looking forward to getting this, to find out more about the heroes of that time and will get one for my dad, Williams brother."
3,Way to much work,Not worth the effort. It works but not that great. I'm all for over working to get results. Everyone think I'm nuts when it comes to detailing. I did not get the results I wanted.
1,peels,"I bought 2 bottles for my car and my sons car, It looked great for about 4 days then it started peeling on both car bumpers! I am so disappointed I could just puke. Don't but this product!"
2,Just use armor all...forget bondo for most trim,"I've tried bondo and other dye type products. After time in sun, couple rains and car washes, it just don't look even or anything like new trim. Its a bit of a pain to put coat after coat, touch it up here and there, I'm just not happy with them.If you use just plain armorall, the results look better. For sun exposed faded trim, bed liners or heavily sun exposed trim, I'd perhaps recommend bondo or simular dye type products to bring back the black, more than armorall .I usually re-spray the body trim on my 2011 kia sportage,which runs around the entire bottom of the vehicle, and rear bumper is black. Its alittle work each time. But when trim is dry, i spray the trim area good, use a cotton cloth and wipe it down, armorall removes tar and other residue. Takes me like 3 minutes, quick wipe down and it really looks good, like new trim, and the area with a little road tar is cleaned up also. I'll stick with armor all for lower body trim, for the best look."
1,It lacks creativity and wallows,"Personally, I think the book is a worthless bunch of...crud that was obviously written by more that one person causing a distinct lack of cohesion. I don't think there is an original thought in the book. The author seems pious in his presentation."
3,not good for investment advice,"I thought it was amusing (and for those who listened, disastrous) that of all the investments he listed in Chapter 10 (The Savvy Peasant's Investment Guide) of my 1999 edition, the one he stated was the poorest (i.e. precious metals) was the one that has generated the highest returns in the past decade. So much for his investment smarts. Not a bad book but it is interesting how he was so very wrong about this issue."
1,Too much deprivation,If you never spend money you won't have to worry about running out of money before you die. But who really wants to live that way? Isn't there some happy medium between this book's do-without message and the other books trying to tell us how to save and invest?
3,Errors in the planning worksheet,"Noticed a MAJOR ERROR in the worksheet from Ch 8. ""How Much Money Will you Need When You Retire"".Step 1 starts with AFTER Tax Income, howeverStep 2 SUBTRACTS the difference in taxes between working and retired.Seems to me that TAXES are being neglected twice. This ended up being a $40,000 per year error between when I created a spreadsheet based on this 3 years ago, and what I see now! This is present in the 5th edition of the book -- not sure if this has changed since previous editions."
3,Not a retirement book about money,"This book is different from most retirement books I have read as it has very little financial information. It is more about the other aspects of retirement such as friends, family, hobbies, work and other things that will take up your time and give you fulfillment in retirement. Of course being a NOLO book it tends to be long winded at times, dry and boring. With books like this you can just skip the irrelevant parts to you. Also there is an interview after almost every chapter. You could easily shorten your reading by 60 to 100 pages by skipping these as they all tend to say the same thing. It is a book worth reading if you are looking for a different perspective regarding retirement, but if you want numbers and financial information this book has very little and what it does have is so basic."
4,Good advise and motivation,"I liked this book, it's a great companion to other books by the same author. I would recommend to others."
4,One of the best,"I read someones comments, that there is ""too much deperveration"" in this book. I think they need to re-read it. The whole point is NOT to have too little, but to have what's right. This book confirms my long held belief that you can save ""too much"" and miss what's good for the now. On the other hand, chances are you will live a good while, so you cannot neglict that either. This book shows how to do both. The mindset of many people is just plain wrong, and this book, even if you don't agree with it, shows another way of thinking. Based on the retired people I know, it rings VERY true. Health, Friends, Family are first, the money part can be managed. You should read this book. It's very good."
5,Green Wilma is hilarious,"Children will love this book. It is well illustrated, keeps your attention, makes you laugh, and keeps you wanting to see what Wilma will do next. I found the book extremely enjoyable and would be a good investment in your childs reading library."
5,Full of wit and surprises for preschoolers and early readers,"Green Wilma is as witty as they come. Fast paced and full of charming surprises from beginning to end, this book engages readers, both young and old from the moment it's opened. Even before the first words, my son was enchanted by Wilma's darling feet, poking out from beneath the blanket.And who could resist and opening line like, ""One morning Wilma woke up green and much to her surprise, she sat up on her bed and croaked and started eating flies."" From there ""Green Wilma"" takes you and your child on a rambling adventure through an exciting day in the life of a very unusual heroine. And you won't believe the ending!"
3,Science mixed with sensationalism,"A lot of research has been put into this book. Unfortunately, the research is mixed up with anecdotes and conjectures. In extrapolating research data, the authors often make wild guesses as to what proportion of the population is affected by the Adonis Complex. There are also lots of case studies that focus on extreme cases. These amount to little more than sensationalistic journalism.The book does have a lot to offer. The fat free mass index is a great way to calculate your genetic limits with regards to lean body mass. Sample surveys are provided to help diagnose those who may be suffering from the Adonis Complex. The book seems to condemn an obsession with a lean, muscular body. However what people are willing to sacrifice to obtain their goals is just a matter of personal choice and the authors have no right to make judgements upon those who strive to better themselves. A lot of the information is eye opening but I wish they'd just stick to the facts."
1,"one sided, stereotypical, and ignorant.","I am a 21 year old bodybuilder and I came upon this book in hopes that it would help me learn more about myself. However, it ended up trying to convince me that all of my effort that I have put in at the gym is worthless as I am just a person with low self-esteem that is just trying to make an image for myself. In actuality, I love lifting weights, getting stronger, and building my body. I do not do it to attract women, intimidate people, etc. I also believe that steroid use is a very personal decision and that it is alright as long as you are an adult who is knowledgable and aware of the risks associated with their usage. There is a difference between use and abuse, also. I found this book to be one-sided, stereotypical, and ignorant."
1,Written by some bookworm who has never lifted weights,"We are not all in this for looks. If you haven't trained hard before and pushed yourself to your true physical limit, then it is impossible to pass judgement on why someone would be obsessed with exercise. We all have our own ways of talking to God--the monk meditates, the poet writes, the singer sings. Some of us (whom this book is about) instead like to go to the gym, push ourselves to failure, and train harder than we have ever trained before. Bookworm academics should stay in the libraries and out of the weight room."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with the writing and editing. The whole book seemed rushed and did not at all approach the character development and depth in the Shield of Three Lions and Banners of Gold. I didn't feel connected with the characters as I did in the previous books. I have been waiting since I was fourteen for the conclusion to Alix's story and though I am pleased with the outcome, I was wholly disappointed with the book. In addition, misspelling and typos throughout."
2,A boring disappointment,"I read Shield of Three Lions and Banners of Gold in 1988. I know the year, because my daughter had just been born. To wait so long for a sequel and have it turn out like this!There is no adventure, no romance, no fun. It's mostly a big bore about the Magna Carta. We never get to see the big romantic reconciliation we wait for.If you read the first two books, you are better off writing your own ending. I feel that Ms. Kaufman's heart just wasn't in this one. Sorry kiddo! But I will still read any new books you write."
1,Not worth your time,"This book is awful. The events are improbable, time sequences unrealistic, characterizations non-existent, and plot boring. Previous works by this author have been fine, but this book is totally disappointing."
2,frustration packed,"As a big fan of Tron the movie I had high hopes for this Xbox title. Sadly I feel slightly let down. The look of the movie don't really work in a game environment. It is very difficult to judge where the playing area is, where the player can go and where the player cannot go. There are leaps of faith all over the place, leading to frustration to set in early on. Compare Tron 20 to the mega Halo and you'll be left laughing. The audio is the only area that of Tron 20 that I quite liked.If you are looking for an Xbox game that features lots of weapons and intense action packed game play, then Tron 20 simply isn't the place to go."
1,CONFUSION SETS IN FAST,"All in all Tron is average. Nothing to write home about, the game looks ok in places, all be it in an average sort of way. The style is high contrast looking, this may work in photos on the XBOX DVD cover, although in game all becomes a mass on confusion. The design will leave you thinking you yourself could have done much better. There appears to be a total lack of sense of any real thought gone into the game. The music is the best aspect of Tron 2.0"
2,Why you should purchase the X BOX 360,"I bought this video game for my boyfriend, D.Roll for Christmas, but I did not understand that it was not compatible with his gaming system, the X Box 360. He was very excited about the new movie Tron, starring Jeff Bridges and he wanted to play the new video game. I would suggest making a Tron 3.0 for around $35-40 incorporating older models of the original Tron 2.0 and adding the newer faces of the actors from the new movie."
2,30 Levels of luke warm action,"Tron Killer Ap is quite possibly one of the weakest FPS currently available for the Xbox. The weapons are somewhat primitive with there being not many to choose from. While there are 15 weapons to choose from, the disc is the only weapon worth arming yourself with. Other downsides to Tron include lots of loading time, a somewhat dated looking game that lacks any real depth or innovation.The big bug bear with Tron is the poor design. You will constantly find yourself in situations not knowing what to do next, often with death being the only outcome. Good news is, there are many opportunities to save your progress."
1,Tron 2.0 Killer App is weak,"Compared to other first person shooters like Halo, Tron 2.0 Killer App is weak. You'll either really like the look of the game or loath it, depending on weather you are a fan of Tron or not. Tron 2.0 seems poorly designed, and it seems for this reason alone that it is possible to save your progress when ever you like. The game looks dated and failed to impress me in any way and was a below average Xbox title."
1,Junk with a Capital J,"What a piece of junk this receiver is! The picture quality on non-HD programming is mediocre at best although the HD picture is amazing. The problem is that only a handful of shows are in HD on DirecTV. The first problem I had was when the analog receiver went out so I could no longer watch cable or traditional over the air broadcasts. The receiver soon began to shut itself off for no reason. After it would shut itself off, it would need to be fully reprogrammed. Now it has frozen on and you cannot shut it off, change channels or work the receiver with the remote or directly on the box. The manufacturer told me to unplug it and plug it back in after 15 minutes. Still frozen. If I had not had it for 5 months already, I would have tried to return it and get a Sony."
3,Freeze problems,I had this for 2 days and every 15 minutes the box freezes and has to be rebooted. Im sending this back to samsung to get a new one.
5,Steelpad QcK - Grade A Mousepad,"I'm just gonna make this short and simple, all-in-all, I've had NO problems with the mousepad, and shipping was fast! Before this, I used a generic cloth mousepad, then my friend gave me a Steelpad 4D, but it got hot in the car when I went to a LAN tourny and molded up, so it wasn't flat anymore. This is way better than my other two mousepads!"
4,Young Lester Flatt!,"Chris Sharp is as real as it gets! If you love traditional bluegrass and a hard driving G-run on the guitar, then you seriously need to give this a listen. Not to mention that he's surrounded by Nashville's best like Earl Scruggs, Josh graves, John Hartford, Mike Compton, Kenny Baker and MORE! This was engineered by David Ferguson (Cash's engineer for 25 years). It doesn't get much better than this for a debut album folks! Lester Flatt would have been Proud!"
2,Not what i thought,"Next time i will read the product discription carefully this is not what i expected.I'm really not worried about what kind of material the flags were made out of or what the canteens were made of.I thought this would be about the battles they fought what they did right or wrong or what they could have changed during the battle, not about how many chickens were stolen.I would have been very upset if i paied [.35.99..] for this but at 4.99 plus shipping well i did learn a few things.Make sure you get the lowest price before buying."
2,Others seem to really like this DVD,"I however found it to be boring almost to the point of self mutilation. This DVD basically goes over little known facts about confederate things (from uniforms, to belt buckles, to knives, to guns, to flags, etc.) Strangly I did actually learn a lot from it. I just was in total agony wondering why in sodding heck I would care about a sodding conferderate belt buckle...Anyhow, like I said, I learned a lot of detailed facts and was severely bored while doing so. I will not care to watch it again."
2,Jeremiah Chrichton-the worst ever Farscape Episode,"While The Flax is a decent episode, Jeremiah Crichton might as well be an episode of Gilligans Island. Using the amazingly cliched plot of a primitive culture that thinks one of the shows regular cast is their god, viewers are treated to Rygel being mistaken for a god and of course the almost havoc that ensues when they discover that he is not. If I never see this plotline used again in a television show or a movie I will be a happier person. I love FARSCAPE but I really hate this episode and all it's gag inducing unoriginality. I'm mad that I even own this disc and would not if it was not for the fact that The Flax is a good episode."
3,Won't buy without extras,I recorded both of these episodes off of the sci fi channel. Why Would I want to buy this DVD without some good extras. A commentary track or even production note subtitles would be reason enough. It's not that hard to make me happy. But this DVD cannot stand it's own when the epsiodes are already available in so many other formats.Otherwise.. The Flax is a decent episode and Jermiah Crition is a medicore one. I love Farscape but the first season had a lot of episodes where they hadn't really developed the characters or the idea of having an intracate plot that also had a lot of fun dialog and slapstick at the same time.
2,"decent playing, but not GREAT playing","She is a very polished player. There is nothing BAD sounding about this CD at all, but Megumi is not one of the players I would pay good money to go and hear. James Markey, Joe Alessi, and Nitzan Haroz are the trombone legends of our time. Players like these are pushing the edge of the technical/expressive power of the trombone. I think any aspiring trombone student would be better advised to listen to GREAT playing, not decent playing, and this CD is certainly not GREAT playing."
3,Shipping took forever!,It took over a month for me to receive this in the mail. Other than that the book is in great shape.
2,Worst Lovesey Book I've read,"Pretty absurd plot. Lovesey is generally a brilliant author, but this novel is tiresome and implausible. Although the Bertie series is not his best, other stories in this series are far better. Unless you have an overwhelming interest in the parlor games played by Victorian royalty, stay away."
1,Duck Soup it ain't,"Quirky, yes. Funny, not so much. But for people who think sophomoric equals clever, this is the perfect DVD."
4,Temp sensor,I ordered one and it did not work. The company gave me credit and I ordered the correct one.
1,Max range of 4 feet...,"Based on other reviews it seems a good portion of these remote sensors are defective. I carefully followed instructions to set this unit up as a replacement for my 3 year old unit that is used with my original Lacrosse receiving unit. It worked only within about a 4 foot, direct line of sight range and would not work from outdoors even if within 4 feet. I looked up more detailed set up instructions on the company's website and followed those too, including changing the batteries and making sure the new batteries measured more than 1.5 volts (actually 1.62 v). No luck. I contacted their technical service through the website and got an answer in a few hours, but it was of no help - no new suggestions. So, I sent the unit back to Amazon which was no problem (except had to go to the post office). I now have a fancy receiving Lacrosse thermometer that only shows indoor temp. Uncertain if to risk ordering another remote sensor or scrap the old receiver."
3,Not as accurate as I'd like,"The specs on this unit are +/- 2 degrees ""under normal conditions"". That probably means ""at room temperature."" At winter temps, freezing and below, this unit is over 5 degrees off. La Crosse more or less admits to this on their web site. The saddest thing is that the LaCrosse base stations display outside temperatures to 1/10th of a degree - for a sensor that is +/- 2 degrees at best and generally not even that close."
2,Temperature Sensor,I'm a bit disappointed with the product. I'm on my third unit in a period of 6 years. Seems to me to be a rather high failure rate. In addition the replacement units I have received register temperatures that are 3 - 5 degrees higher than actual (measured using different thermometer). Unfortunately not many alternatives available. The plus side is that Amazon has handled returns/exchanges very fairly and quickly.
5,Works well if in a protected area,"I only wish this item was impervious to the weather, since it has to be placed outside to work! This one replaced the original supplied with the clock/thermometer that, after a few years, fell off the wall and into a puddle of mud. They say not to mount where it will get wet, and the unit obviously doesn't like thick mud, either. I placed the new unit in a more protected location, and so far, so good. I was very happy to find this replacement unit on Amazon for far less than ordering directly from La Crosse. And buying the replacement sensor was a LOT cheaper and less wasteful than buying a new clock!"
1,Poor quality,"The TX3 remote sender is no longer available, so I had to purchase the TX6U. Below 30F this unit is inacurate and sometimes does not work at all. I have two LaCrosse weather stations that have been working flawlessly for several years. The battery operated remote units need replacing every couple of years or so. No problem, however the TX6U remote unit does NOT live up to the standard I have become accustomed to from LaCrosse. How about making the TX3 unit again? That was a good unit, just like good cars & trucks, they stop making them when they find out they don't wear out. I would NOT recommend this unit to anyone in a cold climate, (most of north America) below 30F... Poor relibility. Below standard."
4,Works well,This unit was to replace a missing one on a clock purchased at a garage sale. It has good to better range than others I have in the house. Batteries lasted about 6-8 months in sub zero weather here in MN. It is always withing 2 degrees or so from the others so it seems accurate.
4,Lacrosse remote sensor,This was a replacement for a remote sensor that died. It worked fine from the beginning. Be sure to follow the instructions to link to the base.
2,replacement for original,"The original one that came with my weather station lasted three years. Maybe that is ok, maybe not. It reported overflow temperature and stuck there. The replacement was better than 1/2 the price of the original entire weather station. So far I am thinking maybe not such a good deal. The new one works good however."
4,Time will tell...,"When they're working, I have no complaints. My original sensor only lasted about a year before it stopped working. I sure hope this one does a little better."
4,good product,This product was just waht I needed. Service from Amazon was great. Shippipping was quick and on time.
5,Weather Sensor,This sensor was bought for a replacement for my dad's La Crosse Temperature Station. I had contacted La Crosse to ask which sensor to order. They answered within a day and first gave me suggestions to ensure the original sensor was indeed beyond repair (my dad did not secure the sensor properly and it fell about 8 feet onto concrete). They also provided websites to reorder the sensor. I ordered it from Amazon and we reset the station once we received the sensor (we rec'd it very quickly) and it works great.
1,Poor shipping instructions,"The vendor failed to note the shipping service for the item (FedEx, USPS, UPS etc.) so the product was never delivered. Hard to rate when it doesn't arrive. One would think that with all the data bases in the US, a vendor wold know which Zip codes have UPS delivery and which do not; and then select the appropriate shipping service."
2,occasional problems,"I cannot be 100% sure exactly what is causing my problems with this sensor, whether its the sensor itself or the home base. Either way i just bought both and it appears the screen display fades away and vanishes...on occasion and I have to tap it to make it work. I also notice the sensor for outdoor stops every so often sending the reading. I simply get this.."" ---"" 2 or 3 dashes...with no temp.it is not as i expected..and I have tried differant batteries. The manual says when you buy additional sensors, they instructions on how to set them up will be in them. They arrived with NO instructions."
1,Buyer Beware,"The sensor I got from Amazon didn't work. Plain and simple. If I was buying another weather station I would not buy one from LaCrosse, and I would definitely not buy this sensor again on Amazon."
1,Bad Bad product. Waste of $$. Company is not helpful in working with U to get it working. Major run around from Customer Serv,Bad Bad product. Waste of $$. Company not helpful in working with U to get it working. Major run around from Customer Service who don't know their product. I own the weather station it is supposed to work with. I bought this second sensor because I couldn't get the one that came with it to work. Customer Service said I would probably need an additional sensor. Stupid me. I fell for it. Still can't get any of the units to work. They keep telling you to take the batteries out and go through this elaborate process to install it. TOTAL waste of time. Don't buy it or any other product from this company. Save yourself the aggrivation.
4,LaCrosse Technology Wireless Temperature Sensor.,Works perfectly with matching LaCrosse Technology products giving accurate temperature readings. Placement is critical. Not as weatherproof as could be. Need to make sure it is definitely installed out of the way where any moisture can reach it.
5,accurate temperature sensor,"Be careful to put batteries in correctly. And don't let it get soaking wet, a few drops are OK. I ruined one when it was knocked from its outside protected location and got very wet. Original lasted 3 years."
2,Lots of problems,"It worked well for a while, then quit. Another one that came with a different base unit didn't work right out of the box."
3,Excellent Wireless Temperature Sensor,"I replace my old outdoor temperature sensor with the an identical model. The old one lasted almost six years, but eventually stopped functioning due to moisture in the unit. If you purchase the complete indoor/outdoor units, be careful that the one placed outdoors doesn't get soaked in the rain."
4,Temperature Sensor for La Crosse Weather station,"My wife and I really love our La Crosse Technology weather station. It was given to us as a gift from our neighbors who also bought one for their use. This purchase was made by accident. We really wanted the model that sends and displays both temperature and humidity. This works great, however, for just the outdoor temperature but has no temperature display on its face as does the other model. Therefore, I can only give it four stars."
4,Nice replacement.,"I sold my old house a few years back and I forgot to take the remote temperature sensor for my La Crosse unit so after seeing the time and inside temperature for the past 3 years I thought I'd look on line to see if it was available. (They change things so much I never thought it would be available)... Anyway, it arrived today and placed 2 ""AA"" batteries in it and it immediately began transmitting the temperature. This comes with the mounting screws and two way sticky tape in case you don't want to drill in anything plus the documentation for the sensor. Very happy now and glad I decided to keep my older unit even though I have 2 others. Seems to be accurate so far with the temperature. Of course the placement of the sensor has a lot to do with that so think before you mount it."
4,Simple Remote Temperature Sensor,Hooking up the remote sensor to my la crosse atomic projection clock was very simple. I just took out the batteries reset the clock with the sensor beside it and they found each other immediately. My only complaint is the sensor constantly reads about 8 degrees warmer than all my other thermometers. Overall it was a great product for the price. Just wish it was a little more accurite.
1,Lack of communication,"It is inconsistant sensors. You could put one in the fridge & one next to a heater & ch 1 would be 40 & the other 80...then after a while, ch 1 would be 75 & the other 52. Not impressed."
4,Great replacement,my old sensors had gotton full of water and I thought I would have to buy new clocks to replace them. But I found this sensor replacement and It has work great. I got two of them. I have one in the frount and one in the back of the house and they both work great. Plus it was shipped to me fast.
5,new sensor,This is great replacement product. I lost mine in a move and was glad to see I could get a new one so easy.
4,Remote temp sensor failed after 10 months,"The clock is great, sets itself and shows moon phases BUT - Like everyone else my TX6U failed (remote temperature sensor) after about 10 months. Replacing the batteries didn't fix it so I am here ordering another one. Maybe I should get two. Stuff that lives outside usually doesn't last as long and this temp sensor is no different. I had it under an awning, protected. Here in the Vegas desert it gets hot and now it's cooled down and something happened to it. Hundreds of days of expansion (heating) and contraction (cooling) will cause the TX6U to fail."
4,Wireless Temperature Sensor,"During a tremendous wind storm, my original transponder/temperature sensor crashed to the ground and no longer registered.Was so happy to find this replacement... works very well."
4,works as it should,This device works as advertised. I bought it as a replacement for a lost sensor. It has good range and accurate readings.
3,The product is not work for long,"I bought this even I had read all the reviews. But because the one which came with the clock survived for more than 3 years, so I gave it a try. This one worked only not even 2 months. I gave 3 stars because the Amazon customer service is very good. After I called, they sent me the new one right away. I don't know how long the new one gonna work. Let see, I will update later. Thanks Amazon for great service."
1,Unreliable,"Very unreliable operation. It frequently fails to communicate with the main unit, and as a result the outdoor temperature is not displayed."
1,inaccuracy,The sensor was consistently 4 to 5 degrees warmer then the actual outdoor temprtature so I tossed it.
2,Battery Freezes during winter season...,"Once it reaches freezing point at 32 degree. signal is sent out intermittenly (sometimes it works down to 15 degree but most of time, remote quits), outside temperature doesn't display until the temperature rise back above 36 or so. I was thinking of insulating the remote.. but then.. temperature won't read correct. it's catch 22."
3,Sensor durability,I liked the outdoor sensor until it blew down. It dropped to the concrete porch and appeared to be OK but never worked again. I will try one more time.
1,"Doesn't work, have to get a replacement","I ordered the 9611 base which seems to work well. However this transmitter doesn't work at all. The base never received a signal no matter how many times I tried or new batteries I used. The transmitter that came with the base worked right away. From the looks of it, the inventory may be older than the transmitter that came with the 9611. Now I have to go through the hassle of getting a replacement. Hopefully that one will work!"
1,TX6U Wireless Temperature Sensor,I could not get this product to work with the La Crosse WS-8035U-IT Wireless 915mhz Forecast Station as it was advertised to do. After several hours of trying to get it to work I finally gave up in frustration. Had I known that this would be the case I would never have purchased either item.
4,Works like a charm!,"We are currently living in our 5th wheel behind our newly constructed garage with winter fast approaching. By using two of these temperature sensors with our weather station, we are able to monitor the temperature in the basement of the 5th wheel, in the living quarters of the 5th wheel, and in the utility room inside the garage. I only gave the sensor four stars since it took us a while to get both sensors programmed in correctly."
1,"Unreliable, Short-Lived","This was the 3rd of three remotes I've had linked to a La Crosse clock/thermometer unit. The first fell and broke, but the second and third units simply failed. While they worked, the range on the units was very poor. I had difficulty at times in getting a signal within 8 ft. through a window in line of sight with the remote. As nice as it is to have a remote temperature sensor, La Crosse doesn't seem to be able to provide reliable products for that purpose."
2,"Disappointing - short life, poor quality","I mounted the TX6U under a railing, vertically, protected from the elements as best as can be expected. Battery life was good (about 1 yr), but it failed in less than 2 yrs - first intermittent, then died completely. I'm an engineer and wanted to diagnose and repair it. I had to cut the case open, as it's glued together. Found evidence of corrosion inside due to solder flux left behind when manufactured. This had shorted out the assembly. I just ordered a new one and am not encouraged by what I read here."
1,Poor quality -- failed within 6 months,Purchased this with the La Crosse Technology WS-9013U-CBP Wireless Temperature Station. We had two units outside in the moderate climate of California (Bay Area). The first failed within 6 months and the second within a year. These are not hardy devices -- kind of a problem for something that's intended to be used outside and exposed to varying temperatures. I would not recommend this product.
2,Sensor doesn't work,The sensor shows the correct temperature every other time; but the wrong one in between. LaCrosse is sending a replacement.
3,Works fine when new,"Given these are for outdoor use, I don't think they last long enough. The battery terminals tend to corrode and I have to replace them once a year."
1,6 months to 1 year - its dead!,"I've ordered 6-8 of these and they never last more than a year, unfortunately it is the only thing that goes with the base unit. When the base unit goes, so does my relationship with La Crosse."
2,failed,"I started with one star because the sensor failed after one week. But I honestly don't know if it was the sensor or the receiver that I already had. But I changed batteries in the sensor twice. The first time there was still no signal from the getgo. The 2nd time I used lithium batteries and that was when the signal lasted a week. I had thrown away the packaging and so didn't make the attempt to return. I did still have all my setup instructions and followed those exactly, but no signal. The receiver was still showing all the other info, just not the outside temp. from the sensor. I found a new weather station for only a few dollars more and was shocked at the fast set up in less than a minute. I had always had to struggle a little with this brand's setup."
2,Outside temp sensor failed after 1 year,1. Sensor was off about 3 degrees high from the beginning2. Same problem that sensor fails long before clock does.3. Like the LaCrosse atomic clocks but these sensors suck.
1,CAREFUL-- this is NOT compatible with all LaCrosse Stations!,"The Amazon description of the TX7U says that this unit is ""Compatible with all La Crosse Technology weather stations except the Professional Weather Series."" I bought a LaCrosse Combo11-T, Models WS-9037U-IT/WS-9080U-IT weather station, (which nowhere--not on the web nor in the product manual, claims to be ""professional weather series"") and bought two of the TX7U remote sensors to complement my purchase. When I could not get them to work I noticed that the sensors are 433 MHz while my weather station is 915 MHz. Nowhere in the Amazon web advertisement did it indicate these sensors were 433 MHz. BEWARE.I am giving this only 1 star because of the misleading sales information. It might otherwise be a good product, but when it is sold to the wrong person it is nonfunctional."
1,Oh Please....,Stopped working after 3 months. Has no user serviceable parts.Amazon has an inadequate return policy.Look elsewhere or consider an entire system.
2,Stuck at 77.2,"This thermometer seems to break easily. I'm on my second, and now it's stuck at 77.2 degrees. I've reset it several times, but it always reads 77.2."
1,If you want dependability this is not it,Bought three senders with monitor. Worked good for a week then one by one they all failed. Don't waste your money on this. La Crosse does not return emails....
1,Lacrosse Technology TX^U Wirless Temperature Sensor,The product was used and did not function wih my unit. A terrible purchase on my part.Certainly would not recommend this product to anyone. I would more likely tell how I spent my money for a inadequate product.
5,Wireless Temperature Sensor,Need to have a sensor to work with an indoor and outside weather station. The sensor is a great replacement for that has failed. There is no sight gauge displaying the temp/humidity. The one that display the information cost $10 more. I got this sensor since I would seldom look at it outside and only wanted the information inside the house.I found the sensor accurate when comparing the readings with the Weather Cannel on the Internet. The readings were within 3 degrees and 3% humidites of the reported readings on the net.Place the sensor out of the rays of the sun.
5,"Gail""s review",This was a replacement for the original Temp Sensor. Works great and replaced the old one which was accidentaly broken.
1,Unreliable,LaCrosse will not make good a faulty sensor if bought via Amazon. The original one was short-lived and the replacement never did work adequately. Avoid the frustrtation -- do not buy.
5,Thank Goodness these can be bought separately,"Well, we forgot to take the sensor off from over the outside of the door of the camper and we merrily drove away. Thank goodness you can buy the sensor separately from the clock/projector or we'd be buying a whole new package! I love seeing the time and the outside temps projected onto my ceiling in the early morning!"
2,Does not work with WD type weather direct products,"The low rating is for the product description, not the product!My WD-3103U (obtained at Costco) lost its sensor, so I ordered this thinking it would work because the writeup said ""The TX6U transmitter works with all La Crosse Technology models except for ""The Professional Weather Center"" Series: WS-2010, WS-2210, WS-2310, WS-2315 and WS-2510.""Since my model wasn't specified here, I thought it would work. It didn't.LaCrosse tech support said ""Only the TX50 will sync to the Weather Direct displays."""
2,High failure rate.,"I love the weather station, however this is the third remote I've had to buy in two years. Surely they could do something about this."
4,Sensor replacement part,Pleased to find this outdoor sensor that was part of our La Crosse wireless/atomic clock and weather station. We left the original sensor outside and drove off in our motorhome without it....we hope to keep this one. Good price to get just the sensor without having to buy the whole setup again.
1,Short-lived,"The Good: The temperature was reasonably accurate.The Bad: My first unit lasted 13 months and second failed after about 7 months.After that, I gave up and now just look out the window a my large dialanalog thermometer.The Ugly: Even when everything functions normally, the batteries last about 7months and it is an unnecessarily complicated procedure to replacethem. And, if you mistakenly put the batteries in with the polarityreversed, the unit is most probably ruined."
2,faulty product,I use this system in 3 different locations and the sensors usually last 2 or 3 years---this one lasted 2 weeks.
3,Useful but short-lived,"I have to echo the many reviews that are satisfied with this sensor when it works, but that find it doesn't last as long as one might expect. This my third. According to my Amazon records I purchased the last on September 22, 2009, so this one lasted about 15 months. I still give it three stars, though, because the replacement cost at less than $12 (today at least) is not all that much.I live in Southern California so the sensor, which is shaded under a patio, is not exposed to extreme weather. I don't care if it is off by a degree or two (others claim that it is).I should add that the La Crosse digital clock (and calendar, moon phase, and interior and exterior temperature) to which this sensor sends signals, and which is mounted in my working office, is an extremely reliable, attractive, durable, and very accurate timepiece (it connects by radio to the Denver so-called ""atomic clock""). I have no complaints about it and would rank it at 6 stars if that were possible."
3,lacross temp sender tx6u,"Iv'e had this unit for 5 - 6 years the sender would work on and off over the years but finally tanked! i smaked it on the kitchen floor and the cover for the sender fell off, i looked at the little sender part and it was full of glue!! like i did that!!! lacross did nothing, typical."
3,Not necessary,While purchasing the La Crosse Technology Alarm Clock I was made to believe that buying this sensor was necessary. It was not. The clock comes with its own sensor. Keeping this one as a back-up rather than deal with the hassle of returning the item.
4,Perfect Fit !,"My old unit blew out after 6 years due tue battery leak. New unit works great. Remember, read the instructions. Most of all click the main unit 10 times to clear the memory before you start again. Thats something I forgot.Now everything works good as new.Hope this info helps ?"
5,Replaces lost outside sensor - no need to buy entire instrument,"When we traded in an RV, we forgot to remove the sensor for our La Crosse indoor/outdoor thermometer, clock, weather station combo. Amazon to the rescue - this is the exact replacement product and works perfectly. Saved us some $$$. Thank you to La Crosse for selling this item separately."
4,Good But Ensure That It is Mounted in a Dry Protected Location,This product works well. Just ensure that it is mounted in an outdoor location not directly exposed to rain.My previously installed piece stopped working after getting wet due to rainwater.I have not installed it in a location not directly exposed to rainfall. It works well.
2,Fails when exposed to dampness.,It is difficult to find a place to safely set this up outside where it won't be exposed to rain yet still be in an area where it will give an accurate reading.
3,May As Well Buy A Whole New Clock System,"If the sensor sells for approximately $ 15.00, by the time you pay for shipping, it will be about $20.00 just with standard shipping. You can buy the whole new clock system for about that much at Wal-Mart. It was a mistake for me to buy the sensor. Because now I see even better clock/weather systems on the market for about the same or slightly higher price."
2,Not another Lacrosse unit,"I have had two of these units, and each one lasts about 6 months and fails. I will not buy another Lacrosse unit."
3,La Crosse Technology TX6U Wireless Temperature Sensor for 433 MHz...,I bought two units to replace two units that failed after 3 to 4 years. These units are not accurate if you're looking for accuracy they are + or -2. They will tell you it is cold outside or it is hot outside within + or -2.You need a book for directions on how to install batteries and set up it is hard to understand.I contacted Customer service and it took a week for a response.
2,You can get both the receiver and transmitter for just a bit more than this transmitter costs by itself.,Transmitter failed after 1.5 years. New batteries had no effect. Unit sat under an alcove and did not receive any direct sun or rain. I'll just keep the indoor display part and look for a different system by another manufacturer.
3,Nice to have but a bit frustrating in performance and content,"Bassist Marke Clarke is really the only one who is playing up to expectations here. This is a short set and Leslie is a bit lazy on the vocals. It's nice to have the footage as it existed in only bootleg form prior. The image quality isn't that great maybe a 7 out of 10 and the sound is just ""ok"". There are no bonus features. This is one of those releases whereby just having it available brings some enjoyment. If you are a Leslie completest then it's a sure bet to buy it. Otherwise the official Mountain DVD may be better. (Although that bassist is no where near the caliber of Marke Clarke)"
2,O.K. DVD,"This isn't very well shot, and I don't think this is a very ""Together"" concert. I think Leslie was having ""Problems"" during this period. I've seen Mountain a few times in the past couple of years, and they have it WAY more together. The ""Live in Texas"", and ""Sea of fire"" DVDs are much better."
4,"I love this affordable, elegant wrist watch","It's getting a little hard to find an elegant, simple watch that just tells time. For a very reasonable price, this is a perfect day to day dress watch. I looked long and hard to find just this model too. I have not been disappointed at all.The band is small, but it looks nice. The watch itself is fairly thin and that means it will feel good when worn with just about any shirt, including a french cuff. The roman numerals, including the more archaic ""IIII"" on a simple white dial face are so simple as to look very impressive. By virtue of this simplicity, the watch is easy to read."
4,pulsar watch,"nice basic watch, very thin, and lightweight. band is a bit small, but ok for normal sized wrists."
2,NOT a child's book!,"The suggested age of 4-8 is completely off - this is an adult's book. Also, the grammatical errors start on page one and end with the back cover! I was totally disappointed."
2,Not soft enough to play without gloves,"I bought this on a recommendation that 16"" softballs can be used to play softball without gloves (key when trying to field a game and none of your friends have gloves). This ball still hurts when being caught without a glove. Since it's too big to catch with a glove that you have, it's not really good for anything."
4,"The measures are of CIRCUMFERENCE, not diameter","The 12"" or 11"" ball is a very nice replacement for a regular softball for younger players learning the game. Softer, carries less far, a little lighter, and a little bigger than a regular ball.However, everywhere I see the dimensions listed, it's listed as an 11"" or 12"" diameter ball -- which is bigger than a basketball! These measurements are the CIRCUMFERENCE of the ball. Look for a picture or a video showing the ball in relation to a person's hand to get a good idea."
5,Love it! Love it! Love it!,"I know it's not the season yet, but I am always on the sleuth for great Christmas music and this was a winner!"
1,Not Chana Dal,Do not order from this vendor (Ethnic Grocer or Namaste). They have a history of substituting split yellow peas for chana dal.
5,Review of Hunting Midnight,Emma Holly weaves a wonderful storyline with memorable characters and steamy lovescenes into a delightful read. I recommend this book highly. When you add the other two books it makes for a delightful and entertaining event you will enjoy very much!
1,"Emma, What were you thinking?","I was extremely disappointed in this book. After having read some of Emma Holly's other works, Hunting Midnight fell much short of my expectations. How this is considered an erotic novel, I am still trying to figure out. If you want to read a truely erotic novel, pick up Menage. You will see then that Emma Holly's true talents for erotic literatute are wasted on books such as ""Hunting Midnight."""
1,didn't do it for me,"I read this based on the enthusiastic reviews listed here.But I've got to say I was veeerrrrry disappointed. Maybe if I hadn't read Ms. Holly's fantastically hot ""Menage"" first ( which someone here listed as a good comparison--all I can say is--WHAT?!), I wouldn't have found the love scenes here so lackluster. But alas, I was bored. I found the other werewolf/vampire type creatures rather boring too. Sorry to all of you who loved this book. I simply did not."
3,Very sexy,"At first I wasn't interested in the series, then I went back and read the two books, this was much better than the first one. The lead characters are funny, sweet and hot. The story line is almost an afterthought but it is a very sexy book. You won't be disappointed."
4,erotica with a paranormal twist...,"I was pleasantly suprised by this book. Most of the erotica I have read has been disappointing in that there was no storyline-basically like soft core porn for women . Not true with this story. I found this paranormal romance engaging, the wolfen like creatures, the upyr, interesting, the the affection/love between the two main characters endearing which make the sex scenes, IMO, far more enjoyable. Nice supporting characters, I can see where they would make interesting leads in future books. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy, werewolf, paranormal romance-except if you have no taste for explicit sex scenes, then skip it. Otherwise 4 1/2 *'s!"
4,Interesting and quite good (for the most part)....,"I admit, Peter Malick is desperately trying to cash in on Norah's fame as much as possible. Yet, this cd is actually well crafted (aside from a few obvious mistakes). The DJ Strobe Brooklyn Vibe Mix of ""New York City"" could have been an excellent remix if not for the guest rapper. The mix itself has a really cool vibe, and minus the rap, it's quite enjoyable! Another track that could have been left off this disc is ""Things You Don't Have To Do"" (Land Shark Dub). It's pretty much the same as the vocal remix, except Norah's voice briefly appears only once, in the middle of the track, and that's it! Basically, this mix is just a lot of noise (which makes for a rather boring listen). Aside from those errors, I really do like the rest of this cd. Of course, I'm an avid Norah Jones fan (so I'm partial to anything bearing her name)."
1,This Stinks.,"I may be a kid but I know stinky when I hear it. Who is this guy to so obviously cash in on someone else's talent? I read that Ms. Jones did not even give him permission to put this vile product out. Mr. Malick, you are a loser. Let's see what you can come up with WITHOUT a multimillion seller artist doing all the work for you.Noah L."
3,Game GREAT-USPS NOT!!,"The wheel and the pedals work great. It's a lot of fun and easy to hook up and use. It's best attached to a table in front of you. However, never ever allow them to use USPS for shipment. It was ordered on 12/7/07 in stock and arrived on 12/27/07, 2 days AFTER CHRISTMAS. I was very disappointed for the person who didn't get a gift at Christmas."
2,Oops..Fell apart!!!,"Worked for about a month and then, as others have said, the pitter fell out. Have been putting it back in after every cherry or olive. Quite annoying. Contacting the company. Will see what happens."
4,As promised,I was concerned about the quality of the product given the price. The table and chair arrived in perfect shape. It assembled easily and looks great.
3,The item I received was not made by Grover Pro Percussion.,"There is nothing wrong with the product except that it is not Grover Pro Percussion the maker of profesional orchestra percussion instruments. The item I received was exactly the same as the one pictured but it was made by the Trophy Music Company of Cleveland, Ohio. That said, the sound of it was not to my liking. Since it is not possible to hear it before buying I decided it was not worth the hassle of returning it. I'm only going to use it during the Christmas season anyway."
4,"Thoughtful, respectful, yet honest assessment","This is an impressive piece of work. Callow catches Welles out at countless examples of self-mythologizing, yet never gloats or judges him harshly -- merely letting his findings speak for themselves. And he doesn't diminish Welles's achievements or fascination as a man one whit. (Nor does he customarily split infinitives, which is refreshing in this day and age.) Though personal failings and the stuff of gossip are noted, Callow does not dwell upon them. His descriptions of Welles's stage productions in the 1930s and early 1940s especially make me wish I had been alive then -- or videotape technology had existed -- in order to see them. The introduction notes that most studies of Welles ask ""what went wrong after _Citizen Kane_""? Callow sought to discover what went wrong BEFORE it, and I think he did an admirable job. I can hardly wait for the second volume."
3,"Short, simple.",This is not the author's best work. It was short and a little simple. Yet there were a few thoughtful passages.
4,Odd like a corndog on two sticks,"Okay, you can go read a ""real review"" at another site. I just want to tell you that this record brings a smile to my face each time I hear it. This album is earthy, quirky, fun and off-balance. I am glad I found it (thanks to a amazon.com customers list, thank you). I like weird music, but not when it is hard to listen to and enjoy as music for music's sake. This album is a pure pleasure."
1,IT'S A CROCK,"Three unconnected stories for this film. The first is base on ""The Monkey's Paw"" as a woman dabbles in witchcraft using tea lights and a sheet with a spider's web on it. In the second feature, a psycho killer tries out for the part of a psycho killer. The third is a weird stalking film.The first two stories had merit if they were longer and done right. The amateur nature of the film is distracting while watching it. Not as good as Ritter's other work ""Creep"" but then that is not saying much.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Even the killing is low budget."
4,All received items.,Zoo really didn't make a lot of sense. It wasn't up to James Patterson's usual books.The scissors get clogged too easily.Sally Hanson products haven't been received.The Movie was a gift.The rest met with my expectations.
3,Equity Alarm Clock,It makes a ticking noise that keeps my wife awake. Electric clocks should work quietly.I would like to find one that is quiet.
1,Clock is poor quality,The clock only kept time for a month before it began sticking everyday and became worthless. Not worth any price in my opinion.
1,Annoying Loud Ticking Clock,"I was happy to find this same make and model of the clock I used for years...but what a disappointment for such a simple thing. This clock ticks loudly. It's electric, not wind-up. It sits on a nightstand but it ticks annoyingly. Why? Unless you like that. The old one was nice and quiet, humming along, doing the job. It ticks even louder than the Advance Black Electric QA Alarm Clock that I bought at the same time (which also ticks!). Wonder why Equity would change a quiet clock to a loud ticker?Otherwise, the styling is fine. The lighted dial is okay. Just like the old one. The time/alarm knobs are firm unlike those on the Advance clock (which move easily when grasping the clock to hit the snooze button--and moving the alarm setting).Clock now sits in the workshop. Meanwhile, I had usual prompt shipment and delivery."
4,No frills electric analog alarm clock,"This product was exactly as advertised. The only thing the description failed to mention was that the alarm setting hand is almost impossible to see with the white face (it's a pale yellow). Since we bought this for my legally-blind mother, we have to change the alarm time for her. As long as the alarm setting doesn't change, it's a great ""traditional"" analog alarm clock."
2,More like a night light,"The clock works fine, very little noise but the light in the face is to bright. Manf. needs to tone it down a little."
2,Product has changed - for the worse,"I had an old Equity 33100 clock which I needed to replace. After buying something in a local store which I found to be annoyingly noisy, I was glad to find that the Equity 33100 was still available on line. However, when I got the clock, I discovered that although the model number was the same, this was not the same clock. The old clock had a ""sweep"" second hand, which moved smoothly and silently. The new clock has a second hand which jumps noisily every second. So, I'm still in search of a silent electric alarm clock (like the old Equity 33100). If anyone knows of one, please add a comment to this review."
1,Tick is unbearable,This clock functions well but it's loud tick is a real drawback. I fall asleep very easily and I must turn on a white noise machine to drown out it's tick so that I can sleep.
4,Aging owner prefers a buzzer,"It's easy to set, it keeps time and it is well luminated.However, for those of us that are gettng up in years and our ability to hear high frequencies is diminishig; these peep-peep-peep peeper alarms don't always serve their intended purpose. Installing a buzzer in that clock would make it a Class A product."
2,poor product,This clock hasn't kept good time since I bought it. Now I need another one. I won't buy another Elgin.
5,Great alarm clock.,You can tell the time in the dark or in the sunlight.Got just what I wanted. Recommend to everyone.
3,It's a clock,"I wanted an analog, electric clock so I could tell how long the power is off (it tends to go off every time it thunders). The dial is lighted with a very bright blue light, bright enough to serve as a night light. It is somewhat noisy as it does tick, somewhat unusual for an AC clock."
3,It's a clock,Clock does tick loudly.Has a small blue light at the bottom of the face that illuminates the whole face.It has kept perfect time.Appears to be a good product.
4,"Lighted dial, yup!!!","Thought we finally found the clock that my wife had for decades. All electric, anilog, same look, and a lighed dial, and no batteries. Have to say we have a lot of fun with this clock since we bought it. Wife shines it in my eyes to get the truth, keeps it facing the wall so it doesn't blind her, shines it through the sheets to creat a wierd motif,. We are going to keep it though because nobody makes a clock like the good old days. If only the Mfg. would install some kind of dimmer on the light, it would be perfect. Oh yes reminds us of a luminal light for detecting fluids."
2,Too Bright,"This Equity La Crosse 33100 is a decent, relavively quiet alarm clock but the neon light is so bright, it lights up the whole bedroom and is unacceptable.I keep mine in a table drawer. Not recommended for bedside. John1."
2,Nice but Noisey,I was looking for a replacement for my trusty Westclox alarm. These no longer seem to be available after using them for years. This looked like just the ticket. But what they don't tell you is that the second hand makes a ticking sound. Who can sleep with that? Westclox was silent.
5,Back to basics,"Just like the clock I had 40 years ago, except for the lighted dial. It is inexpensive and does just what it is supposed to do, and no more. No battery! We live in an area where the power often goes out, usually for brief periods. I needed to know how long those blackouts were. This clock stops when the power stops and comes back when the power does. The difference from other clocks shows me the outage. It is inexpensive, attractive, functional, and retro. I love it!"
3,Ok I guess,"I gave it three stars because it is quiet and accurate. Trouble is it only lasts a few years before it starts breaking down. My husband likes it because it is very quiet. So, ours just broke down and he had me go out and buy another one of the same kind. So unfortunately, it doesn't last long but in general it's ok."
1,DOA,Unit was dead on arrival. Minute hand would not move. Left the unit pluged in for over 30 minutes and the minute hand moved about 3. At least Amazon handled the refund quickly.
3,Basic analog clock,"This is a very basic analog clock. Thought it would be backlite...but rather it has a ""nite light"" at the 9 o'clock position...to show the hands."
1,Disappointed,I had been looking for a lighted clock for a while and finally settled on this one because a review said it was quiet. When I opened it I loved how it looked and even delighted that the dial colour was blue rather than the advertised orange. But the ticking is so loud I cannot sleep with it in my room and the dial is SO bright I can read by it in the middle of the night. Obviously I can't sleep in the same room. Not what I had hoped for. So if anyone knows of a clock that is quiet and does not tick loudly and does not shine so brightly please comment.
2,Redesigned for annoyance,"I used to like this model is because it was very quite, at least until it got to be 2-4 years old. It was virtually silent. It never ticked. It just ran. Now, they've made the second hand to twitch and tick with a rather annoying ""chunk!"" sound, and the light is tinted purple rather than white-yellow, and seems much brighter.I've gone through 3 of these over the last 10+ years, and I was ready for another, but I got a noisemaker and a light show instead."
1,clock that does not let you sleep,"Lighted dial is too bright, lights up the whole room; it is impossible to sleep. The ticking is too loud, again prevents you from sleeping. The alarm does not work. This is a terrible clock."
3,"Tick, tick, tick","Main reason we needed an analog clock -- so when power goes off, we can tell how long it's been off. The loud ticking of the second hand would make this clock impossible for me to use bedside.The alarm works. Snooze bar works, too. The blue light is very bright.We decided to put it in the garage. What the heck, maybe it'll be useful there. And the noise won't be a problem if we're working in there. Hey, I could even set the alarm to let Hubby know when it's time to come in!"
3,Transitions Awkward,Good story acted well but the transitions seemed a little awkward. It was difficult for me to understand how the characters arrived at some of their decisions and the mother living out of her car scenes could have had a little more depth added to them.
5,Warms The Heart,I've watched this movie four times and enjoy it every time. It warms the heart to see adults find love with people least expected. You go Mr. Perry.
5,Good Family movie,Very enjoyable movie to watch helps you to examine your intentions and motives in life sitations that we are confronted with.
3,Not a Good Deed,"Tyler Perry's concept of the central character Walter Deeds doing a good deed was right on, but his ability to act it out is poor. Walter Deeds the conflicted character is not convincing as a man too busy that he cannot stop to live the life he wants to live instead of the life he was born into.His supporting casts are excellent with the exception of Thandie Newton who shares the unconvincing role of being desperate and destitute.The plot and subplot is too predictable. The primary idea behind this movie is to spend millions and make three times that amount. This movies is for profit not the people."
4,Entertaining flick,"I haven't seen many of Tyler Perry's movies, but this one really appealed to me. Good movie! I'm glad I rented it rather than spent the money to see it in the theater. $14.00 would have been too much to spend."
1,Good deeds,"This movie may very well have been very entertaining except that the sound is so un-even. Part of the time it is so low that you can barely hear it and you must turn it up then it is too loud. I suspected piracy, but was assured that this is how it came to them from the factory. So, since I can't concentrate on the hearing the story because I am too busy adjusting the volume I can't say much except maybe I'll find a good copy somewhere."
1,Another Disappointing Title From The Perry Production Line,"I'm surprised this film only has one ""one star rating"", maybe the cast and crew submitted these reviews. The film was dull and predictable, I'd rather spend my hour and change starring outside my window and counting atoms within raindrops. Tyler Perry's knows what his core audience wants and they eat it up everytime and he skips to his accountant's office. I'm mildly entertained by some of his films but this one was a complete waste of my time as the entire premise of the film was weak."
1,tyler perry good deeds,it was ok until i got in the middle of the movie then i started seperating i was not happy with this purchase.i missed the best part of the movie on a supposedly new dvd..i would not purchase again from this company..a dvd..
3,Ok movie,I thought the movie lacked character. Dialogue was minimal but overall it was OK. I think the ending was predictable but really didn't work for me.
5,Nice.,"Everything was in good condition, have yet to open it because it is a Christmas gift. One of my Mother's favorite movies so I just had to get it for her. :)"
3,"It's not bad, more of a romance than good deeds","I love Tyler, I really do, but to me the movie really had nothing to do with good deeds. He did something nice for one person that he fell in love with. He realized how shallow and out of touch he was and he changed, but that's about it. Maybe I'm missing something. I also thought they could've did a little bit more on the brother's character, I didn't like how that played out but it still was a good flick."
3,"Good acting, but I didn't love the plot",I understand the message the movie was trying to convey but *spoiler alert* a woman starting a relationship with a man who first tried to woo her while he was just days away from marrying his live-in fiancee is UNwise. Not my kind of happy ending.
3,Typical Tyler Perry..,"This movie was just OK. It started off pretty good but then it just seemed to be full of stuff to fill up the rest of the time. Poor Thandie Newton always gets stuck playing some ""broke down baby mama"". Same recycled actors in this movie. Tyler is in almost every scene...at least he didn't dress in drag in this one. I would never buy it, wait until it's on BET, it shouldn't be long."
3,JUST OK!!,"THOUGHT IT WAS TOO PREDICTABLE, CHARACTERS TOO UNREALISTIC AND FOR ME THANDIE NEWTONS ACTING WAS HORRIBLE!! KIMBERLY ELISE WOULD'VE BEEN A WAYYY BETTER CHOICE AND STILL THEN I WOULD'VE GIVEN THE MOVIE JUST 4 STARS! OVERALL AN OK FLICK, WOULDN'T WATCH IT AGAIN OR ADD IT TO MY TYLER PERRY COLLECTION. JUST NOT WORTH THE MONEY. OH AND I LOVE BRIAN WHITE BUT THEY TOTALLY EXAGGERATED HIS CHARACTER! LOL BUT TO EACH HIS OWN, JUST MY OPINION!"
1,ugh,I cant. Even think of enough about it to satisfy the minimum word requirement. Got bored with it quickly. Wouldn't. Pay to see it. Don't waste your time.
4,Good Movie,"I liked this movie, it was like a Harlequinn Romance. It's a good chick flick. I would buy this movie."
3,"This contains **SPOILERS**, but if you're a TP fan, you'll know it's not a spoiler but what's expected","I wish they had 1/2 stars on here. I'm somewhere between ""didn't like"" and ""it's ok"". I was fine until the end.Children are the future. **SPOILER** My ex-wife & I aren't on the best of terms, but I KNOW if she lost our daughter because she was homeless and some CEO, excuse me, ex-CEO, of some company offered her a trip around the world, she'd say no because our daughter was still going to school. And DCFS is probably monitoring her to make sure she doesn't do something stupid, like...oh, I don't know, TAKE A TRIP AROUND THE WORLD.Really though, if you're a TP fan, you can figure out in the 1st 5 minutes how this will end."
5,"Nice story for the movies, not really how life goes",I found this movie entertaining but just wish things like that really happened to people who need help. The acting was done well and it kept your interest until the end.
5,love tyler perry,great movie. a little slow moving but i have yet to be disappointed with any of his movies that he has done. i have every one of his movies on dvd.
5,Loved it!,"I think Tyler Perry did a wonderful job acting in this movie. I love the way he interacted with child star in this movie, and I just loved the ending."
4,Good Deeds,Very good movie! Sex scene that children should not hear or see. I would not let my children watch it.
1,Predictable.,"Thirty minutes I was able to accurately predict the whole movie specifically! I fell asleep. I had to be woken up. The best actor was the little girl. And Thandie's character was suppose to be a 'good guy' (by TP standards), yet she treated that precious child like crap! And we're suppose to feel sorry for her? Tyler Perry was boring. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours."
1,Why is he still making movies,"Once again, Tyler Perry delivers a story that not only focuses on a woman's hated toward the black man but also includes a foolish point of view. Wrack performances from Tyler Perry, Thandie Newton, Phylicia Rashad and Brian White. When the movie ended I was SO glad to see Gabrielle Union off the big screen again! I can't wait to add this movie to my worst movie collection!"
1,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed. I ordered this movie on July 9, just got around to viewing it. This movie has the caption (what they are saying) showing and it can't be taken off. It is not my DVD player. It is the movie. Did not order movie with caption. I don't like to read, what they are saying."
1,Skiptastic,"Very dissapointted in this DVD!!! it arrived in a timely manor but has skipped three times in the first quarter of the movie. I have taken it out and cleaned the disk as well as changing players, to no avail... Will not be using this provider again!"
5,Awesome!,All around great movie! Mr. Perry always give a great storyline and follows through with real life problems of All races.
5,Good Deeds,"Great Movie, Glad to see Madea back Tyler Perry has given so many actors and actresses a chance to be seen on the silver screen and a great opportunity and thank you Jesus he keeps it coming 1 luv"
3,Tyler Perry's Good Deeds,"This was the first time I saw Tyler Perry in a serious role, and he was great! This Man is so talented and I enjoyed this movie. It was no block buster, but it was warm and touching. It's worth watching."
3,Recommended almost solely on length and sheer strength.,"This is doubtlessly a solid, sustained cut of upbeat techno at 74 minutes. It is not, however, any step forward for being new, nor a clue as to where the waning WaxTrax! (from a past of revoloutionary new music) is headed. This is a nod to the past, certainly, before everything was about bass, and while that rekindles nostalgia, it also makes for an unimpressive album. The tracks, while admittledly tight and groove-laden, are formulaic and do not take many risks (such as adding an instrument or occasionally leaving out the beat). While it will tide the non-trance dance crowd, there is nothing here better than we've heard in the early nineties. I enjoyed it, but most still won't."
5,The Funniest Man In America,Enough has been said about this great man - if he was running for President my wife would be forcibly made to vote for him.Me - I'm a Brit and miss this style of real humourCheersDavid
1,These are HORRIBLE Kitchen Shears !,"I just received these shears and am 100% disappointed. A true knuckle head designed these shears. They ""look"" good. So good that they plated the edge ! What very little edge there is. You could not call these sharp. They could only be described as way dull. I'm sending these packing back to Amazon."
2,quanity two just rear windows,received the order and this product is just the rear window vents two only not a complete setgood if you only need or want the back
3,Excelent book but some faults,"This book is excellent for the dog/men beginners in agility, but very important faults are committed. No reference on FCI agility is made in this book and the small chapter on health and feeding seems to make marketing to formulated dog foods. Beside these faults, the book is excellent, explains clearly some exercises on obedience and how to teach the dog recognize and negotiate the obstacles. In the end there is a very useful list of bibliography and websites on agility."
4,Great info.,"This book gave a great background of the sport of agility. As someone who is new to the sport, I appreciated the simple ideas and descriptions on how to get started."
5,"All-time top band plays all-time top 12, plus","I am of the opinion that the Ted Heath band from Great Britain ranks with the best big bands ever, from anywhere! Actually, I think they are THE BEST, EVER!This album does nothing to decrease that opinion. The ""Top 12"" selection is possibly the better part of the album, but the ""Dance"" half loses only because ""12"" is just so stellar.My favourites include the timeless ""Begin the Beguine"" (Porter would LOVE this arrangement) and ""April in Paris""."
2,I did not understand it,I did not like this book to much.it gives you information that you dont needand not enough information that you do needi could not get some directions to work rightGot to give it credit to teach in VB and not in C#it did not work well with my learning style
2,Just barely worth the cost of its paper,"This is the worst VB book I've read in all of my life, I needed to get to speed with ADO .Net, and as this book's title says ""Mastering"" I thought this could be the one I needed, especially after reading some of the other reviews.If you are an absolute and complete beginner in database programming this book might help you, but if you already know your basics, step away from it and get David Sceppa's book instead. Half of this book is about the basics of Transact-SQL, but the really basics, not the advanced stuff, and after that you get a bunch of really dumb examples of the database objects that will rise too much doubts in your head, instead of helping you, you'll just get more confused.I gave it two stars, because I was able to use a couple of examples in one of my applications, but that was after I had read Sceppa's book.What a dissapointment."
5,Learn how to be a enterprise architect,"This book is a great way to become more than just a developer - andbecome an architect! Not only do you get practical examples of the code,but the author also steps you through the theory behind why you shoulddo something. Helps you design your systems rather than hack up code. Ifyou are interesting in building any data driven .NET systems, this isthe book for you. Learn everything you needed to know about ADO.NET."
5,Fine Control - Best Stove Made,"In days of old the single burner stoves had a manual valve like this does. You can control the flame from a soft simmer to full bore. The new ones have a stepping type valve which is a royal pain in the a..., and they wear out quickly and leave you hungry or without your morning coffee........lol......Century is no longer making these great simple valved stoves, so if you can get ahold of one.............z"
5,Excellent Resource,"For years, I have relied on the Witches Almanac for planning and reliabe information. I have never been disappointed and this compilation is no exception. The care in the work is evident and speaks for itself. I highly recommend for personal and group libraries. Put it right next to your older versions of the yearly Almanacs."
2,It's Jeep in general,To know Jeep system in general. Just few technical information on Jeeps. Suitable for CJ and Wrangler owners and not for Cherokee lover.
3,Adequate for general purposes,"Not bad for the price. Adequate for email attachments and snapshots. The picture quality depends largely on the amount and type of available lighting. It seems to work best outdoors on bright days; not nearly as well with indoor lighting. No big surprise there. However, the major drawback is that the batteries continue to drain at an alarming rate, even when the camera shuts off. A word of advice: if you don't want to lose your stored photos, upload them to your PC as soon as you have the opportunity. Leave this one sitting around for a day or so and you'll find that you've wasted your time taking those pictures."
3,Don't want to pay too much?,"I bought this camera because I wanted an affordable, digital camera that was small to carry around. I don't have any trouble with the viewfinder. All pictures matched what I took. But battery life wasn't very good. A good idea would be to get a couple RECHARGABLE AAA batteries. The pictures are OK quality. The best is outside. Otherwise, this is a great lil camera if you want to get started and don't want to pay too much!"
4,Mostly pleased.,"We have found this sensor to be a useful tool in keeping track of the temperature in our garage, where keeping things above freezing is a must. Our one disappointment has been in the fact that the sensor is more sensitive to distance & obstacles in the area between the base & the sensor than we planned. This means that we have had to move the base several times in order to get the most consistent readings. That said, it does perform as promised."
2,"Proofreading, Anyone?","I recently purchased this game, and I have to say I was very disappointed. The puzzles weren't very challenging, the game itself was fairly short...but the worst part was the editing! I could barely stand to pay attention to the storyline, because not only was it short and without any attempt at depth, but the grammar, spelling, and punctuation were just appalling. Duplicated words, misuse of similar words (they're, there, and their have different meanings, people), sentences that didn't even make sense...it's like the developers forgot that word processing programs have spellcheck! If you're going to charge $20 for a game, at least TRY to fix this kind of thing. From the demos included on the disk, it looks like the next ???-ville game is just as bad in that regard. Since there are plenty of other hidden picture games out there, I would suggest you skip this one."
3,Mysteryville,For the price it is a fun game. Not too complicated for young eyes. Dissappointed it had so few puzzles.
2,A decent way to blow 2 hours,"Had played this game on a 60 minute demo through Real Arcade and was just getting into it when my demo expired. When I saw it on Amazon, I thought ""great, now I can finish the game."" I didn't realize that I basically HAD finished the game while playing the 60 minute demo. There's not much to it...I played through from start to finish in a couple hours and that was it. I have yet to see how the kids (age 9) like it, but I'm betting even they will get through it pretty quickly as well. Not bad for the money spent, just no challenge at all for me."
2,"""OK"" sums it up nicely.","It's not the best game--I consider the animation to not exist, and, for all the talk about finding the cats, there wasn't much going on. The story wasn't much either. I found it amusing, though, that the makers put themselves in the character roles. I feel that the game has some major potential, but I wish the execution was better."
3,Alternate Version,"I have been wanting to put together a playlist with the big dance floor hits of Studio 54 circa 1978, and of course, The Break was one of them! This was not the version that was played constantly at Studio, rather it was a slower version without some of the high notes and sound effects that I remember from back in the day. I found the 85' re-mix on another cd, and that turned out to be the one that I remember so fondly. This could be the original, or the euro version. It will remain in my collection."
3,"Four Hot Versions of Classic ""Break""","This high energy disco staple appears as four eight-minute versions on this Unidisc release. Two of the remixes are from 1985, followed by the original + vintage ""remix"" from the original period. The only bad thing is that Kat Mandu songs are hard to find. ;-( The two 1985 mixes are by Robert Matichak, whereas the older remix is by Johnathon Fearing, with the original by Steve Thompson. Hot stuff."
5,No conocio al Maestro Jesús,"Me encanta este libro, ya que el Maestro Ascendido Hilarión nos dice como aprovechar a nuestro Maestro mientras está en vida, ya que él no conoció a Jesús en vida y lamentaba en esa encarnación (conocida como Pablo) perder esa oportunidad de andar y aprender de sus palabras.Si cuentas con un instructor que te orienta en este caminar, aprovechalo. Cuando se tiene alguién que va un poquito más adelante que uno sus experiencias y conocimientos nos ayudarán a comprender mejor la ley de la vida."
1,"""It's dead Jim""",Today my Oster died. It was 8 months old. It caught fire internally when I tried to heat up some toquitos. The flames were coming near where the chord entered the chassie. I think it committed suicide with the intention of taking me and my family with it. I wish I could say it lived a good life...but alas I cannot. The controls were so frustating and non-intuitive. Making toast took twice as long as it should have. It's default setting completely burns the toast. I'm happy it died. RIP.
1,YET ANOTHER *FIRE HAZARD* REVIEW. STEER CLEAR!,"I'm not usually compelled to leave reviews (lack of time with two young children!), but I have to emphatically agree with the previous reviews that this toaster is a FIRE HAZARD. While we never got so far as flames, we did experience the burning electrical smell and a timer/off switch malfunction where the only way we could get to shut off was to unplug it. We called Costco and they said to bring it back (it's a year old). I can't believe this thing is still on the market with so many people reporting serious malfunctions!"
2,Bad controls and underpowered,I have 2 problems with this toaster oven.The first is with its controls. It hasthe type of buttons that provide no physical feedback when youpress them. Most appliances with these type of buttons give anaudible feedback when a button is pressed. This onedoes not. It is therefore difficult to know if you have pressedthe button hard enough for it to register.The second problem is that the toaster is under-powered. It takestoo long to make toast. My old toaster oven was much quicker.
5,Great Toaster Oven!,"I have to admit, after reading some of the reviews here, I was a little skeptical using digital controls on a toaster oven. But, in my opinion, you get used to it. It took me about a week, but its like second nature now operating the controls. I like the digital controls better than the knobs now! I also LOVE that this has a light in it. Many don't, and my old one didn't. That was the selling point for me to buy this toaster oven. You can see you're food cooking! I don't recommend leaving the light on full time, however, as it might burn out more quickly."
1,Worst possible instructions,"I am an 87-year old widower who tries to do all things for myself. The user manual that came with the toaster leaves a tremendous lot to be desired. There are things that come with the oven that are not even pictured in the book . . how am I to be expected to use this? The real payoff came when I called Oster and got some ""snip"" who essentially let me know that what I got is what I get. The Oster people can take a lesson from the makers of the George Forman grill who are smart enough to give even the finest details, recipes, and hints."
4,oster toaster oven likes/dislikes,"I bought the Oster 6058 toaster oven online, hoping my baking pans would fit. The description said how many liter size the interior was, but couldn't figure it out in inches, as I wanted my pans to fit with out buying special ones. Fortunately my 1/4 sheet pan does fit, and the shallow 1/2 steam table pan fits also. However it said the controls were digital, which I tought would be great. But without reading the entire instruction book, I couldn't figure it out. I had to make up a cue card so I didn't have to refer to the instruction manual again. My husband couldn't get it to work til I made the cue card, so dinner was extremely late one night after I got home from work. I like the idea of the crumb tray, to make it easier to get out overflow from pies, ect. I'll keep it but next time I hope I can find one that's easier to start and get going."
2,"Slow, beeping toaster","I've had this toaster for a while now, and dislike it. While it is very flexible, I need my toaster to be a good toaster first and foremost. And by that benchmark, it falls short. It's slow!The other thing I dislike is that the toaster beeps loudly when you press most of the buttons on the control panel. This sqawk is quite annoying and when you're staggering in half-asleep in the morning to get your toast going, it's harsh."
1,Oster Digital Toaster Oven with Convection 6058,"Bought and returned this oven.It took over 6 minutes to toast 2 slices of bread.I cant wait that long in the morning.The toast it made was ok, not great, a little underdoneon the bottom side,but not worth waiting 6 + minutes for toast.The oven part might work great, but if you want tomake toast, this cant replace your toaster"
2,No Guidelines given by Oster,"The Oster Toaster Oven seems to perform well, but Oster did not include a conversion chart from conventional oven cooking to Convection oven cooking. I found several conversion charts on the Internet, but the time given isn't always correct. The Oster's convection may not be hot enough to cook the recipes as directed. It wouldn't have taken Oster anytime at all to include a Convection Oven conversion chart with the purchase of the unit. I have a very nice looking appliance that I can use for crisping up yesterday's pizza when using the Convection oven, anything else, I have to either stand and watch the whole procedure or keep adding time! I went to [...] and didn't find any help at all."
3,Does anyone use this oven for dehydrating,"I just got the oven, cooked a porketta and it came out fine. I'm looking into the dehydrating function on this oven. Does anyone use this for dehydrating. The oven temp setting goes as down to 150."
2,Not Impressed,"While I found this toaster oven to be more convenient than using the oven, its controls are not particularly intuitive, and it feels cheaply made. I tried baking a pie in it, and one side was much darker brown than the other.Then, after a few weeks, it stopped working. The clock stayed on, but the buttons stopped responding most of the time, and when the buttons did work, the oven would reset after the heating element had been on for a few seconds. If you look around here on Amazon, you'll see this exact same toaster sold under a few different brand names. (VillaWare is one example)This oven also used too much counter space for the amount of cooking space it offered. The roundness wastes space.In short, I would recommend going with something else."
3,A mixed bag,"I didn't buy this through Amazon; it was a lovely gift from a friend about two years ago. It has lovely capacity. I like the multi-functional features. The front panel requires some learning, but I get it.HOWEVER: It's VERY SLOW, it's true. That's not fatal; you learn how long it takes and do your other preparations while you wait - and wait.But more troublesome, I hadn't had it very long at all before THE BROILER STOPPED WORKING. It SAYS it's broiling, but on toast or on broiler, only the bottom element functions. I hate to discard a toaster which is so new to me, as I usually keep them much longer; but once in a while, you'd like to broil, or have a piece of toast you don't have to flip in the middle of the sequence, or toast again briefly to get both sides browned.So while I'm shopping for a new one today, I thought I would give this input.Fannie Toner"
1,"Inconsistent, slow toasting & baking!","There are cheaper products that do a better job than this. I was disappointed in this product because Oster products usually are good.There is one of these in my office and everyone agrees that it takes ""forever"" to toast bread (about 8 minutes) and the baking/broiling results are inconsistent. The bottom element seems to be hotter than the top one because toast is always browner on the bottom. We sometimes flip the bread over during the toast cycle in hopes of getting it consistently brown."
3,don't like the push-button feature,"I like the toaster oven, but don't like the push-button feature. When I press a button, it doesn't give any sort of indicator or confirmation, so I don't know if it's on or not. I notice that I keep pushing the button harder and harder just in case, so I know that one day, I'm going to break it. It actually reminds me of the first ipods."
2,do not buy,"My unit hasn't been used two hours total when the digital display went out. Do not purchase an Oster toaster oven with a digital display..In a follow up to initial review I contacted Oster and was amazed how fast and courteous they handled my complaint. I couldnt believe they sent me a new oven with no hassle. I have changed my opinion of the Oster brand, but not the oven I reviewed, and would deal with them again in the future."
4,toaster oven,"I was thrilled with how fast this item arrived. I plan on using it mainly during summer as I don't use the stoves oven so as to avoid heating up the house and making air-conditioning work harder. I was impressed that it can hold a 9x13 pan, although it just fits. I've not used the oven at this time, so I can't review how it works."
4,Oster Toaster Oven,"Number one, we feel we got a very good price for this item - $85 was the best we could find. The oven works very well and looks really nice too. I have used it on broil and fan bake so far and it does a nice job. It isn't as fast as the microwave because you have to heat something up for about 10 minutes to equal 1 1/2 minutes in the microwave. But, you do not get any dangerous EMFs nor does the Oster Toaster change the molecules in the food, so it is much safer. We do not use the microwave anymore. This oven is a nice size and more versatile than smaller ones. We kept our toaster because we read that it doesn't make good toast, but overall, we are happy with this oven and feel that the Oster brand is a quality brand."
2,great price if you dont have an oven,Didn't work as expected-didn't receive baking tray with it. Tried to make pilsbury french bread in it -just to try it out-did not cook well-took longer then it was supposed to. Also used convection because I heard it bakes cookies evenly-NOT and took an additional 4 minutes to bake them. Perfect for someone who doesn't cook a lot-but I do and this was not for me. Great price-thats about all I can say-Oh and I did like the way it looked!!
2,Great until it went Kaput just after a year!!,"I loved this toaster/convection oven until it just quit 2 days ago. We've had it just a little over a year with no problems. Used it every day for toast, bagels, mini pizzas etc. Was a big foot print, but that was fine. All of a sudden the controls went haywire and wouldn't start or anything. My husband called and talked to Oster and was told they don't make this model anymore and therefore no replacement parts either. So I'm very dissapointed and not encouraged by what's out there on the toaster oven front."
1,dried out toast,"This toaster oven is so slow to toast, and the element doesn't get hot enough, so that by the time the bread is toasted, it is completely dried out. This is going back to the store."
3,Too big!,The toaster would be great if it wasn't mammoth-sized!! It is too huge and I am sending it back. I hope I find a stainless steel one that's not so huge!
3,What happened?,"Loved and used it almost everyday until yesterday...and it just stopped working after 1 month! Nothing, completely shut off with no power, not even to the clock. And yes, it was plugged in. Question is, do I risk exchanging for the same model or do I go with another brand?"
2,"Decent as an oven, worthless as a toaster.","I hate giving negative reviews, but this is one thing I have to rant about. I've had this ""toaster"" oven for seven months now, and I've finally give up and am now searching for something more akin to the old ""fire hazard"" model I had a decade ago. The quartz bar technology in this model takes forever to heat up, and in the case of toasting, never truly toasts-- it just warms the item up, never making it truly crispy or golden brown (unless you put it in for multiple cycles, in which case, it dehydrates your item completely and *still* doesn't make it any browner). As a mini-oven, it does work, and the convection is nice, but be prepared for insanely long preheat times."
2,Danger! glass explodes unexpectedly,"After almost 4 years of moderate use the toaster oven baked its last pizza. After having it on convection oven 400 degrees for about 10 minutes the glass front door exploded outward. Luckily it was safety glass and shattered into finger nail size chunks but it scared the crap out of me. It had about a 2 foot blast radius.It used to be a good toaster, cleaned well, the temperature only slightly changed over 4 years but that just meant putting toast on 3 instead of 4. For the three very good years of service I upped its stars from 1 to 2, but I would steer clear of this bomb."
1,don't waste your $,"Takes soooo long to make toast and it is so aggravating. Isn't that the main reason to purchase a ""toaster oven""? I mean 8 minutes+......I am not one to write negative reviews but Oster does not stand behind their product. They suggested I pre-heat the oven prior to making toast??"
4,Great product!,"It is great as a toaster and excellent for reheating; it is also great for baking a potato, but we have not used it for anything larger yet. I love the pull-out drip pan for easy cleaning and the adjustable racks as well. My only disappointment is that it doesn't come in white. I am not a fan of stainless steel or brushed nickel especially because it shows every fingerprint or smudge. So, Oster, if you want a really excellent product on the market - do a white finish for those of us that have other preferrences...."
3,Looks better than it cooks.,"Bought it at WalMart after discovering only a couple of convection ovens can hold a 13X9 casserole pan.It does get hot and heats up the kitchen a bit - not sure if it's less than regular over tho.So far everthing I've cooked, with or without convection takes at least as long as my regular over - so I'm thinking the other reviewer who found the temp was 25 degrees off may be onto something.Also, I don't care for the digital press point buttons. To change the temp or time, you have to press the button for each minute or degree increment. It's annoying to drop down from the default 30 min's to 15 minutes...press 15 times.I've cooked frozen pizzas, a pork loin and a few other things. No consistency.I'm going to return it and try the Black & Decker Digital Convection which is about the same price, also has capacity for 13X9 pan and see how that goes."
3,"Great for a year, but then disappointed","I've had this oven for about 18 months. It has been great. Minor complaints about the top of casseroles getting too brown but I loved the fact that I can fit a large casserole dish in it. Another complaint is the handle is plastic and the paint started to wear off after one year of use. If you have large hands you might burn yourself when reaching over hand to grab the handle because your knucles will brush against the chrome at the top of the oven and this part does get hot.Here comes the disappointment. After 18 months the top heating elements are no longer funtioning. I hate to think of another toaster oven in the landfill and really wish this would have performed longer. My husband is checking in to replacement parts, but it looks doubtful at this point. I think it will go to the recyle bin and I am now shopping on Amazon for a new toaster oven."
5,Good looking product and works really well.,Good looking and good working product! We have broiled Texas Toast and baked biscuits so far. Learned to make the biscuits on the bake cycle rather than toast.
2,"too big to be a toaster, clock doesnt work, shelf falls easily","The toaster takes a while to heat-up. The clock doesnot work well, its goes too fast, I have tried to reset it several time, but it keep going faster.The shelf falls down easily, just pull it out 3 in, to take your food out, it falls to the bottom.Usually Oster make okay product, but this one is bad."
2,It was fine until it caught on FIRE!,"We bought our Oster a little over two years ago. Liked pretty much all aspects of it until one day I was making a small batch of cookies and smelled something odd. When I went to go check it out I saw that the electric circuitry had caught fire and was burning in the interior of the oven! Scared me, I unplugged it from the wall and threw some baking soda on it. Was not good. After the fact, I read through some reviews and realized that the Oster catching fire was not an isolated incident. I cannot recommend this oven due to safety issues."
3,Died in 3 yrs.,"My wife and I really loved our SS unit... just big enough to meet most all of our needs without heating up the big oven... but... it DIED, DEAD, after only 3yrs... the electronics just smoked one day without warning or reason... our last Toaster oven lasted over 15...!!! very disappointed and will be looking to another brand for replacement..."
1,Not what we expected,"before we ordered the Oster 6058 toaster oven, it sounded like it had everything we wanted. Wrong. When standing at normal height and loking down to a counter top it is imposible to read what each button does. There isn't ever a light behind the buttons nor is the printing easy enough to see. In the window at the top there are red bars with something printer above them which I still have not been able to read because the printing is about 1/16 of an inch and not even clear. They don't tell you these things when you read about it. We like Oster products and always found them reliable. This one works fine, but it helps if you are 4 feet tall.Mel Bronston"
2,TERRIBLE controls. Otherwise mediocre toaster oven.,"Decent sized toaster with some of the most horrible controls you could possibly think of. There are no knobs for anything. A ""correctly"" designed toaster oven would have one knob for temperature, and one for a timer. This one defaults to 30 minutes and 300*F temperature. To fan-bake something at 450*F for 10 minutes, I'd have to press the ""oven"" button twice, then the ""Down"" button about 20 times to change from 30 minutes to 10, and then the Timer/Temp button to switch to the temp controls, and then press the ""Up"" button about 5 times to reach 450*F. Then I have to press start. On any decent toaster oven, all of this would involve twisting two knobs.Whoever designed these digital controls should never hold another job.Oh, and the outside of the unit gets so hot that you can't touch it. It's not very well heat insulated."
2,Went through two of these before I gave up...,"I purchased our first Oster Convection Toaster at Costco as a Christmas gift to myself. I was very happy with its performance, using it to toast or bake a few times a week. However, in May, only five months after purchasing it, I started to smell a terrible burning electrical smell when I turned it on. It got worse, and I kept thinking I should return it. After a week of the burning smell, it just stopped working completely. No display, no nothing. So, figuring it was just a fluke, I returned it to Costco and got another, identical one. I had that one two weeks when all of the sudden, an E-2 message showed up on the display. It wouldn't let me do anything - every time I tried to press any button, it just displayed E-2. I looked in the manual for some kind of a code, but couldn't find anything, so I returned it again to Costco. I figure I've learned my lesson and won't buy a third."
5,You get,"You get what you pay for, this worked great. Just know these things are tiny, but are a breeze to work with. I use it for anything that requires minimal work, and needs to get done quickly."
1,Flaky,I own this tablet and frankly it is not worth the bother. It is totally unreliable when I use/try to use it in photoshop. The pointer darts sporadically across or up and down and if it is the paintbrush that is being used it messes everything up.Don't expect any help from customer service because they do not even reply to emails.There must be some sort of conflict with XP because the pointer either freezes or becomes hyper active and selects everything and anything.This has been one of my worst online buys!
1,damaged box,"I had the same problem other people did with the damaged box (staple marks on the box went through to the product). I am waiting for them to pick up my return... we'll see how the product functions when I get what I paid for...12/15 the saga continues. I received a replacement, but it was also damaged. I'm going to order from somewhere else...."
1,I should have read the reviews first,"Windows XP SP2 recognizes the tablet, but the pen control software must be installed separately. Unfortunately, the included pen control software is 16-bit (probably DOS-based) and won't even install under WIN XP SP2. I downloaded the new drivers and had the same problem.I've contacted Aiptek but, after reading the rest of the reviews, I'm wondering if I'll even get a reply.I'll keep you updated.Thumbs up for the tablet. 8-)Thumbs down for the pen. :-("
2,does not fully work -- no pressure sensitivity,"I can use this as a basic pointing device, which does not work as well as my laser mouse, but the pressure sensitive features of this device do not work in any major graphics software that I have tried it in. All tech suport says is ""install the new drivers."""
1,Glitchy useless mess,"This product isn't worth much of my time, so I'll be quick. The cursor jumps horizontally when crossing certain thresholds. One time of that, there is occasional jumping (and clicking) all over the place. It's just broken and unusable and I'd stay away from any product by Aiptek."
2,WARNING - DOESNT WORK WITH CS2,"The pen pressure feature works with Photoshop CS1 and earlier, but not CS2. Aiptek and Adobe point fingers at each other, so no-one is going to fix it. There havent been any driver updates for eons either. Also causes PC to spontaneously reboot from time to time. Waste of money. No wonder there are so many available 'refurbished' even from Aiptek's own web site. AVOID."
1,Don't buy this tablet-It is garbage with no tech support!,"I have had this tablet for 5 mo. and have yet to have it work on any of 3 computers running Windows Me and 98. I have not gotten any response to 3 e-mail requests for tech support and a live phone call just puts you on indefinate hold. It appears that there is a problem with their drivers, but neither the one on the CD-rom, or the ones that can be downloaded from their site work. This is one of the worst products and customer service I have encountered in 20+ years of working with pc's. Don't waste you money on this piece of garbage!"
3,duende,Interesting story about a young Englishman trying to fit into the world of flamenco. It seemed realistic and didn't idealize the lives of the musicians. It was easy to see why he got into drugs. The story kind of fizzled out at the end leaving the reader wondering what happened to the author. The elderly lady in Granada could have used more explanation. How did she know so many people and get around so much? I'd like to read a sequel.
2,Not The Real Item,"Jason Webster's a decent writer, but don't expect to learn much about flamenco here. Duende is a melodramatic account of an illicit love affair, drug abuse, car theft and life on the road with a 5th-rate band. There are far too many memoirs of this type already; do we really need another?The good -- though extremely brief -- discography is one of the few segments of the book that's worth reading. In all, a huge diasppointment, especially given the publisher's claims of authenticity. Do yourself a favor: buy (or borrow) some flamenco CDs. They'll give you far more insight into the music than Webster's book ever will."
1,More Mills & Boon than Lonely Planet.....,"""Carlos continued to speak as my educated brain drew on years of intellectual training to justify what I'd done"" - this self-absorbed sentence should be enough to ward anyone away from this tiresome account.Apparently Jason Webster went to Oxford, a point he makes repeatedly in this book. Not since ""The Great Gatsby"" has there been such name-dropping of this institution, and at least in Fitzgerald's novel 'Oggsford' was not incidental to the plot.As a travel novel, Webster's effort hits the spot sparingly. There is much information on Flamenco and bullfighting for the beginner, however the style of writing owes more to pulp romance than to quality travel writing.I must agree with other reviewers on the point that this is more a fiction than a memoir, and also that it will appeal more to the romantic than the traveller.I was HUGELY disappointed. And to think, this book was written by an Oxford man..."
3,The Heart of Flamenco,"The book is may be a good start for the author, but so far not a bestseller. It describes in a wonderful fluid way the mentality of people doing Flamenco, not the art on it's own. The question about Duende becomes a more philosophic one and left the reader a bit unsatisfied with the resulting interpretations. At last is it a good story about the difficulties which any outsider has to experience when settling down in Andalusia to become a true Flamenco. The book is great as a first reading for guitarists interested to enhance their skills in playing and experimenting with the right people in Spain. I hope Jason Webster writes his next book with more ""Duende""!"
1,BAD,"This book is a joke the only people that would like this are those who dream of one day running away to spain with a gypsy and living a romantic life. It is pathetic how he speaks of flamenco in the way that he has been playing it from childhood, at one point he says ""Ole,they dont know the meaning of ole"" sorry but neither do you mr Webster. I do not recomend this book as he is just trying to sell on the basis that Flamenco=exotic , Exotic=Selling , Selling=Money..."
1,Freshmen Level Book,Not very impressed with the book. It look like someone took freshmen level problems and outline solving them with Excel. I would not recommend this to anyone other that a high school student looking to enter the engineering field. I would not recomend it to any engineer!
1,barely mambo,"If you like Montovani, you might like this music too! The musical arrangments are orchestration of Latin music that is best explained as washing a vibrant clothing to the point that it becomes faint and colorless."
2,Disappointed,"While her sixties portraits were fun to look at, I was disappointed with this book. I realize there is a very complicated procedure in the ""way"" these pictures are captured and printed, again I was hoping to see photography that would move me. There are pictures by photographers that when you see them they ""move you"". Most people are really not interested in the intricate development of the pictures, we are interested in what the pictures say, what they make you feel....not the difficulty of printing them. I have quite a few books of her photographs as when I was studying photography and photographers I chose her works because I admired her the ""person""...Sorry I must be missing what so many people think are great pictures. It does beg the question though ""is it her pictures"" , ""her name"" or ""her tragic death"" from breast cancer that causes reviews to be favorable?"
2,"Bad Cop, Bad Cop","Tami Hoag's characters have a fondness for profanity. So, if you have a problem with text laced with tough street talk best set this one aside. I'm not a prude but I found the salty language a little over-seasoned for my taste.Ms. Hoag's tough homicide detective, Kovac and his foul-mouthed sidekick, Tinks, are on the trail of a sexual sadist. Kovac knows who did the awful deed right from the start, giving us an insight into the tunnel vision that often seems to affect non-fictional cops. Go after the suspect with everything you've got - due process is for wimpy liberals.Plot was a bit telegraphed."
2,Not her best effort,"I'm a Tami Hoag fan, but this book was weak at best. The plot was predictable; the characters stereotypical and 2 dimensional. The reparte between the characters was overly witty and contrived. Hoag is definitely capable of a more intricate plot and better writing."
1,"Hoag should've filed her manuscript under ""prior bad acts"" and not published this one!","I'm an avid Tami Hoag reader. I own every book she's ever written and anxiously await the release of each new one. But, Prior Bad Acts wasn't worth the money or the read. The characters are under-developed, unsympathetic and difficult for the reader to establish a ""connection"" to. The plot is weak. The villian is evident from the second he's first questioned by police. There's no romance between the lead detective and the victim that the reader is ""waiting"" for -- something Hoag is famous for. She definitely failed on this one. Prior Bad Acts doesn't even come close to A Thin Dark Line. If you want to read a Hoag thriller, pick up that one. Perhaps Hoag should re-read it too. Maybe she'd pick back up on the style she's lost."
5,Good author,Like authors who get me involved in the story as this one does.Highly recommend her books.
2,Getting sick of the Kovac-Damsel in distress thing...,"I've read every single one of Hoag's books and thought most (if not all) were great. I give it 2 stars because the idea behind the plot was at least respectable. After that the book dives head-first into a ditch. Hoag spends about 300 pages dancing around Kovac's desire to save/fall in love with/rescue this woman. The tough-rugged cop thing is becoming a little over the top and quite frankly, overused. You read basically nothing about the killer they are ""supposed"" to be chasing. I understand the idea behind the romance/mystery theme, but this one relies way too heavily on the romance innuendo. I will definitely read more of Hoag's stuff, but I just couldn't wait for this one to end.I think Hoag needs to take a break and develop some new material. This one is better suited for a TV drama."
4,Hoag has improved over the years,"The first time I read a novel by Tami Hoag I threw it down in disgust; it read like a badly written combination of a potboiler and Harlequin romance, with a liberal dose of sex thrown in.Apparently Hoag has learned from experience, however, because this new novel is her best work so far. And while I was easily able to guess the identity of Judge Carey Moore's assailant, this didn't detract from the suspense Hoag built up in her story - not to mention that built up by the narrator of the audiobook, Holter Graham, who seemed to know exactly the right tone to take at each critical point of the book.This is the first time that I know of that Hoag has used characters from another of her books, and I hope it's not the last time she'll use them. I'd like to meet her detectives, Kovac and Liska, again - not to mention Judge Moore and her adorable five-year-old daughter Lucy."
3,Easy & entertaining,"This is the third book in the Kovac/Liska series and, in my opinion, so far the best. The plot isn't particularly original, but the story moves faster than in the two previous installments because the writing is less repetitive - although we have previously encountered the ""you're my angel"" motif/motive in ""A Thin Dark Line"" and I hope Hoag won't use it again. I think she is setting Kovac up for another disappointment with his new love interest, but at least she didn't kill this one off."
4,"Great book, fair audio","Prior Bad Acts was a great read - good characterizations, brisk plotting. I saw the ""twist"" coming early on, but it still worked well. Hoag does a particularly good job with the banter between her police protagonists. My only quibble is with the audio. Holter Graham has ... the most ... annoying delivery ... of any narrator I've ever ... heard. He pauses ... every few words. I'm not sure if it's his way of ... modulating his breathing ... or if he feels certain ... words .... need particular emphasis.... but it's annoying as all get out. He rocks right through dialogue for the most part, although some of the ... quieter conversations ... get the same treatment. Narrative passages ...stagger out ...chopped into two or three word phrases. Very distracting and irritating. He's now on my list with Flo Gibson and Jen Taylor as narrators to avoid."
3,Decent Read,"I like to call these kinds of books ""pop novels."" It read clearly and concisely and the plot was OK, if a little contrived. You can pretty much tell where the story is going to go but I was willing to see how the author would get us there. Take this book for what it is, a guilty pleasure."
4,Tami Hoag's best novel!,"A conservative judge, who follows the book on an indicted killer and in the process makes enemies; a long-time dedicated homicide detective, who is traumatized by the case he worked; the teenage son of a victim who is a puzzle; two dedicated detectives, who as partners know one another extremely well; an about-to-be-ex husband, who is a real slimeball jerk. All these characters come together with a superb plot to keep you turning pages into the night. The twists and turns keep you interested, but the ending will blow you away!"
4,Good but not her best,"This story was good, but not my favorite. The first Tami Hoag story I read was Night Sins and was expecting the same level of greatness. This story is good, and I definitely was not sure whodunit until the end, but it didn't captivate me the way Night Sins did. A good read though!"
2,"Judge Dingdong, and Her All-Star Bell Clappers.","Please! A smart woman makes it as a judge, regardless of her political agenda, and she does the Hillary Clinton with her husband when the marriage is already over? Hello, if you married this man in the first place, you have no business on a bench! Dingdong cop is in love with her, and another dingdong cop--who has witnessed these things for years, by the way--manages to crack up over this one murder. Hell, I knew who the killer was half-way through the book, and he was smarter than all of them. Tami was hard up for material on this one, and the only person in this book I truly felt sorry for was Carl Dahl. Come on Tami, you've done better, so keep the storyline alive with Ann and Vince. Prior Bad Acts just sounds like a self-fulfilling prophecy at this point."
2,Cardboard characters,"I usually like Tami Hoag's books, she is a story teller with a surprising twist. The twist was there this time also. However,the characters were way too predictable. They all seemed on the dark side, even the ""heroes."" Surely there has got to be a non-divorced person in this world. Not in her book. Well, unless you are the guy who kills people because they're in the way. Then you can be single and never married.The bad guys had no redemptive features -- too cartoon-like.And the unnecessarily bad language was a turn-off. Surely even in cop land not every one uses the f... word in every sentence.The plot was somewhat interesting but felt undeveloped, kind of like the characters.Of course tastes differ. I like a bit more psychological depth with my murders than Tami Hoag offers in this story. Maybe next time."
1,Disappointing,"After reading virtually everything that Connelly, Crais and Block have written, I cast about for some additional mystery authors that I might enjoy. Because a number of Hoag's books were highly rated on amazon and other sites, I tried out Prior Bad Acts. Unfortunately, I found it quite unappealing. The language was overwrought and the plot was silly and unbeleivable. Peter Robinson, Ian Rankin, T. Jefferson Parker and (on the somewhat lighter side) Harlen Coben are all better suited to my tastes."
3,A SO-SO BOOK,"This waxed and waned as far as suspence went. What seemed an obvious clue, was totally lost on the detectives. I couldn't believe they could be that obtuse. Some parts were fast paced & good, others were slow and boring. I listened to CD on road trip & found myself able to stop listening at any point, unlike others I've listened to."
2,This book was way too long for what it was,"This was my first Tami Hoag book. I won't say it's the last, but I probably will choose other authors over her. This book was like a mediocre TV show at best. Too much time was spent on irrelvant issues and facts. I mean, the (paperback) version is over 500 pages! Way too drawn out. And the author seemed to take a few incredulous shortcuts to satisfy a plot point. I have to admit that the last few hundred pages were the most gripping. Maybe I've been reading John Sandford too long!"
2,Average; She could do a lot better,"The judge has really gotten herself in a bind in this book, however it's the classic ""damsel in distress"" here and also the ""only one man can save her""...same old same old. I think Ms. Hoag ran out of ideas with this one. Some authors crank out books when they're running out of money...this appears to be the case with this book.The storyline is okay, but predictable. To be fair, there is a lot of suspense and violence, but I was sick to death of the constant sexual descriptions and the ""perfect"" body descriptions, especially at the age of the two main characters. If MY body was as perfect as theirs are at that age, then why are they cop and judge and not Mr. America and Ms. USA?Ms. Hoag needs to take a vacation to drum up new topics to write about."
4,Another great Tami Hoag,If you like Tami Hoag books you will not be disappointed with this one. Although I figured out whodunit early on in the book it still keep your attention with all the twist and turns Tami is famous for. I would recomend toother fans!
5,"Too short - give me more, much more!","There were plenty of pages, but I didn't want the book to end. I could have read about Sam Kovac and Carey Moore for at another two or three books.Great story. I don't want to spoil the suspense for you, but let me tell you, there are lots of twists in this and I doubt whether you will discover all the answers yourself.Tami Hoag is one of the best thriller writers around. This had a hint of romance, but implied only, in the very successful way she did in Dark Horse.I got Prior Bad Acts the day it was released, and now I want more. I know she doesn't rush her books out and a great book like this takes time to write and edit, but when can I expect the next Tami Hoag book?"
5,Great Book,Love Tami Hoag! She weaves such great characters. Kovac Liska are a perfect match!!! They make every story very entertaining.
1,Not revealing.,"Diary of Jünger when he was a German officer in Paris under the German occupation.This is a very disappointing book. It contains only superficial remarks on the war, on the German occupation, on Hitler (Jünger was a Nazi opponent for Nietzschean reasons, see 'On the Marble Cliffs'); further, notes on philosophy, language, some special situations, his sentiments. Everything without serious interpretations.A waste of time."
3,Not too bad...,"I bought this for my fixed 50mm f/1.8 II and it works great once attached to the lens. The problem, however, is that there are no threads on the front of the hood for attaching a filter or even the lens cap to. Thus, the hood must be taken off anytime a filter needs to be changed or when you just want to put the lens cap back on! Quite frustrating."
3,Not good for short focal distances.,"I find this fine, I use it with my 18-55mm but at focal distances 24mm and lower itgives a horrible looking vignette. This is the only thing, that as you use it youhave to be aware of your restrictions."
2,"Does the job, but Cheap plastic.. You get what you payed for ...","The shipping was fast and item received on time.. The product exactly filts (This is Screw mount type) in both of My 18-55 VR and 55-200 VR Nikkor lenses. So does the job which it intended to ..BUT !! the Markings on the Hood are really faded of and it also had some Manufacturing defects ( leftovers from the mould etc). Also the quality of plastic from it has made seems reallly cheap.But the product has average looks. If Seen from a distance, it looks perfect. As my 18-55 lacked a Lens hood, I would really use this . But My first impression seeing the prodcut was ""DISAPPOINTED"", but after working on it, it slghtly came up (That's the reason for 2 Stars). But for the price, it is good buy especially as there is no petal lens hood from nikkon avilable for a 18-55 VR that comes with Nikkon D5000."
4,"Finally, not too bad","It took months to get them broken in decently, but they're finally turning out to be pretty comfortable. They don't breathe too well, I think because they're mostly synthetic materials, so keep that in mind, but pretty good overall. I'm satisfied."
3,"Nice shoes, but watch the size","Just got these from Amazon and can tell they are really nice and I am sure are comfortable. I ordered a 12, which I got, but they are way too small. More like a 10 or 11. The box and the shoes both say 12. I've never had a problem like this before. I look for a 12 and a 12 fits. I sold them to a guy in my office who wears a 10 1/2. He is happy and they fit him."
3,comodos,"son cómodos al andar, mi opinión después de varios meses de uso es que la suela ano es muy resistente, tiende a rajarse fácilmente, pero mis pies están cómodos"
3,Too small,"These shoes are fitted smaller than what other shoes are. I purchased them one size bigger than what I normally wear but their wasn't any room for the toes to move around. They fit my wife nicely though, and she thinks they're comfortable."
2,Not-so-hot,"Using Microstoft Project 2003 by Tim PyronIt's exactly 2.000 inches thick, which, I believe, must have been one of the publisher's criteria. If you've used Project for years on a daily basis and want to know even more, it's for you. If you want to learn Microsoft Project, don't buy this book. It's a direct violation of the ""Say what you need to, as simply as you can"" rule from 8th grade English. Do yourself a favor. Forget about MS Project and buy Mindjet's MindManager software. You can learn that in an afternoon and it's far more powerful software."
1,"NOT a history, NOT any good","Talk about false advertising, this video will NOT provide students w/ any understanding of the civil rights movement beyond simple platitudes spouted by CNN reporters. There is NO narration over archive film clips, no speeches by MLK (just a couple of brief library shots of the man), indeed no history whatsoever.This is simply a collection of CNN reports w/o any reference to historical context. I made the mistake of (1) believing the first reviewer; (2) shelling out $60 for this POS, and (3) showing it to my students before previewing it. Waste of time and $. I'm still looking for a good 30 minute video/dvd that can provide some sort of history of the civil rights movement in America. But this one is crap."
3,scifi/fantasy,"Amazon ebook REALITY CHECK -Interesting plot - combining real and virtual reality. A bit weak in character development. I was reading, wondering what the writer would do next, instead of getting attached to any of the characters, or feeling very emotionally involved with the story."
4,wonderful tale`,"A quick and delightful read. If you are a Piers Anthony fan, this book delivers exactly what you expect-some unexpected twists and turns!"
4,"I loved this book, but . .","Piers Anthony is one of my favorite writers, and I don't think I have read anything by him that I disliked. This book is great, a chance to solve intriguing puzzles along with the characters in the book, which I enjoy. As he does frequently in other stories, Mr. Anthony shifts points of view between chapters, to round out the story. I volunteer with teenagers, and I kept thinking that this would be a great book for them, except for one part which gets a little explicit about some sex and torture. It's not ""dirty"", it's not tawdry, it's realistic and gritty, and I would think twice about letting young teenagers read it, which is really a shame. Otherwise, this would be a great book to read at the same time as teens and could start some great discussions."
1,"Reality Check, by Piers Anthony","The house is a great idea................but the people in it...the grandfather is a closeted pedophilia, the grandmother is an enabler and a little off, the grand daughter is a slut, the girl from India is way off, the grandson is okay if you don't mind a 13 year old having the hots for his cousin as well as an 18 year old who, is way out there. The only decent one is the boy from India who is constantly backing off from the 15 year old grand daughter who by the way is dating a 25 year old man. The creepy thing is the grandparents letting the two minors make the decision to let aliens take over their minds, Like Judge Judy would say, ""they are not fully cooked yet."", or by law,are not capable of making an important decision like that. What about growing up first? Where was Mr. Anthony's head when he wrote this book??"
3,Okay effort from the Lawton-era lineup,"Although it doesn't compare with such classic Uriah Heep albums as those done in the earlier part of the decade, Fallen Angel is an ok collection of rock songs and ballads that devout fans of the band will enjoy. The title track, an all-out rocker ""I'm Alive"" and a pretty love ballad ""Put Your Lovin' on Me"" are the highlights. The third and last album to feature John Lawton as a singer. Although all the songs are decent and well-done, one can't help but get the feeling the band has dumbed itself down somewhat in the last couple of years since Firefly."
4,fallen angel is a helluva album!,"Uriah Heep's final LP with John Lawton is a verygood album and the import is even better. Songslike woman of the night, one more night and thehard rockin I'm alive! are killer rock songs andthe slower come back to me and fallen angel aregood songs also. the remaining tracks are goodbut a little pop for Heep but I don't hear a badsong which by today standards is pretty good! It'snot for the heavier Heep fan but I like all theones with Lawton so.... The bonus live tracks areworth getting it. Now!"
2,NICE SEXY COVER,"For years, I really avoided buying this album. I think what putme off were the song titles! Well, this past year, I finally didpurchase it and I now think I was right in not buying it sooner.Of all the Heep albums done with Ken Hensley, this is easily oneof the worst! This is by far their poppiest and most discooriented album , tho is does rock out a little more than it'sprdecessor INNOCENT VICTIM. There are about one or two greatsongs here:"" woman of the night"" is a very enjoyable, upbeathard rock number, with John Lawton sounding like a cross betweenGraham Bonnet and David Coverdale! He would've been perfect forRainbow!! The title track is okay, as is ""falling in love"" and""what d'ya say"", this last one sounding a tad disco-ish. The back-ing vocals are a major distraction!! I do like the cover!!!"
2,Why is that Punk looking at me funny?,"In 1975, Uriah Heep were on top of the world:Top Ten album:huge world tours,the full nine yards.Unfortunately in 1976lead singer David Byron left.Oops!3 years down the line things were grim.Replacement vocalist John Lawton had the pipes but looked like a mad old tramp(sorry!)and Ken Hensley just wasn't delivering the songs anymore. 'Fallen Angel' has it's moments('Whad'Ya Say','Falling in Love') but too much is pure padding.This is the sound of talent without direction.Just as metal was making a comeback Heep were drifting off on a sea of 2nd rate soft-rock.I mean 'Come Back to Me'?Er no, thank you very much.'Woman of the Night'? Bog-standard rocker-and hey what about those syn-drums on'Fallen Angel'?Disco down baby!Fanboys only."
3,Standard Heep,"There's nothing particularly bad about ""Fallen Angel"". But there's nothing particularly good about it either. What you have here is a very average Uriah Heep album. There's one classic, the proto-power ballad 'Come Back To Me', and a lot of standard-issue tracks. The band is tight, Lawton sounds fine on what would be his last studio outing fronting Heep; it's just that the songs aren't anything to get excited about. Basically, ""Fallen Angel"" is one of the last albums to get to complete your Uriah Heep cd collection in my opinion."
1,No this is quite bad.,"When looking at 70s hard rock/metal, it would appear that this was a very pirmitive time of development for many heavy bands as well as the genre in general. As a result, gems dating back around this time from the hard rock and heavy metal world are few and far between. Case in point is Uriah Heep's ""Fallen Angel"". On this particular outing, the band finds themselves musically confused, FALLING if you will from their former glory days as a raw, heavy psychadelic prog rock unit (i.e. albums like ""Look at Yourself"" and the self titled realease) and into a smoltering HEEP of boogie woogie rock cheesedom on par with the likes of the Bay City Rollers and that really lame ""OOGA-CHAKA"" band. Aw...a complete disaster, with the only redeeming quality of the album being its cover art. Avoid at all costs."
4,A nice late 70's commercial effort,"This was probably one of Heep's more commercial sounding efforts in the 70's. It was unfortunately not the commercial success it could have been. The music here is more pop than hard rock; not typical Heep, but it still holds up comparably to anything else that was being played on Top 40 radio in 1978. A notable disco influence can be heard here too; probably the first (and last) time this has happened on a Heep album. Hardcore Heep fans may or may not like this album, but if you are into some of the more bubblegummy pop-metal bands of the late 70's (e.g. Angel) this one should be right up your alley. Best tracks: ""Put Your Lovin' On Me"", ""Fallin' In Love"", ""Whadaya Say"", and the title track."
4,GREAT CD HAS AN 8 PART TUNE ON IT.,OK GREAT BAND AND CD WITH SYMPHONY PALYING PARTS AND THE INTRO TO IT. CALLED THE SUITE LINGUA MORTIS AND IT'S IN 8 PARTS AND IT'S A ROLLER COAST OF GREATNESS. ALSO THE SONG SPEAK OF THE DEAD IS A POWER METAL HEADS DREAM COME TRUE. GOOD CD NOT AS GOOD AS UNITY OR SOUNDCHASER BUT WOTH GETTING. ALSO GETTRAPPED AND BLACK IN MIND THERE BOTH METAL MASTERPIECES.AND IF YOU LIKE RAGE AND DON'T HAVE THESE GET THEM FAST.
2,Poor Quality Xylophone,We had the rubber piece that holds the note on the xylophone break off about 2 months after we bought it. Another one just broke off about 18 months after we bought it. The company offers no warranty on their item and it's useless without 2 notes on it! I would not recommend buying this item since the company has no warranty on it. They must not think too highly of their product since they don't back it themselves.Not worth the money!
1,Very disappointing!,"We got this xylophone for our 2 year-old and 3 year-old. It seems great at first, but then the children notice/figure out that the keys come off. The keys pop off the rubber holders VERY easily. My 2 year-old honestly seemed to think that this toy was a puzzle rather than an instrument. I was constantly replacing all the keys. It is fairly cheap quality as well. I finally gave up and tried to add a dab of Gorilla glue to the rubber attachments. The next day I watched my daughter promptly pop the keys right off again and then try to put them back. It was a disaster. We finally threw it in the trash. Buy a different xylophone unless your child is old enough to resist the urge to take the keys off."
1,"disappointing, did not hold up, bad customer service","We ordered four of these for a preschool. Perhaps for a single child this xylophone would hold up, but with regular use, it did not. The rubber nubs that hold on the metal pieces fall off irreparably.What's worse, the company remains incommunicado despite numerous attempts to contact them."
5,Gritty and Gripping,"This book really caught me off-guard. I bought it because of the sultry-looking young man on the cover, but it was the writing inside that really made me tingle. These are the types of stories that have waited since the dawning of man to be written: a young man torn between his dysfunctional parents and the life that awaits him if only he could break the ties that bind; a recovering drug addict haunted by a former lover and a past he can never escape; a disgruntled dog catcher finds his conscience; a young Gen-X couple lured to a double-wide trailer by the sea and disaster. These are stories about the ignored, the allegedly ""inconsequential"" members of our society. Kevin Canty writes with stark honesty about their lives and thoughts, and reveals their lives to be far more interesting, shocking, and heart-wrenching than one could have ever suspected. Simply brilliant!"
5,It's got memorable scenes that you dont want to remember,An excellent collection of stories. Interesting and thought provoking with memorable and unexpected scenarios. Makes you think what you'd do if someone points a gun to your head.
5,A wondeful collection of stories!,I highly recommend this collection of stories to those who read thoughtful fiction. Its sit beside my collection of Raymond Carver on my shelf!
2,Spare? You aint kiddin'!,"It's another one of those literatti illnesses... ""Oh, wait, the writing style is spare? Then it must by Raymond Carver-esque!"" As capable as the writing is, the realizations of the protagonists of these stories never hit home for me, the epiphanies never seemed to... piph... enough, or whatever epiphanies do, as Carver's did. If you like your fiction in the ""huh? oh, i get it... sort of... i think..."", then this may be for you. The man certainly has a buzz about him. But if your taste generally runs toward the sharp, 70 miles an hour clever type of literary fiction, walk away, my friend. And oh yeah, Richard Ford? I don't think so"
3,"I like the time travel mechanics,but the world didnt hook me","This game has presented the best mechanics on time travel RPG's to date in my opinion. There is no comparison to any other game or system, period. If you want to play with time travel this is the game for you.The world however that the game is set in was... a bit boring for me. I didn't like the political groups that the characters had to join, the history was unimpressive and seemed half baked, and I was left with the thought ""ok, I can travel through time... now what?"" I needed a little bit more to understand the motivations of these beings. More of an enemy to oppose."
5,Continuum,It's the best Time Travel Role-play you'll never fully understand. I've been looking for a physical copy of this book for awhile now and I'm really happy to have gotten it.
3,"Great for ideas, not for play...","This book has some great ideas to use in a time travel game. For example the idea of the ""yet"" - things that you learn you must do in the future to avoid paradox. However, if you use all the ideas the game becomes too complex and difficult to play."
2,hmmmmmm,Its a corny little game the board coulda been bigger and more interestin i shoulda sent it back and got my money back for it
2,No thanks...,"I can not recommend this ""game"".... Probably beginners. It is so small (credit card size) than my husband laugh and refuse to play it."
3,seems interesting,"It seems to be really interesing. Hours of fun, if you have an imagination. Not a game/book for the shy quiet types. I plan on playing it dailey. :D"
4,Good stuff,"The package arrived a few days later than stated, however it is understanable considering the holiday season. Good price for the product."
2,May need modification,"This product worked great for the first couple of months I had it. I dropped it, stuffed it in my purse near my car keys, and nary a scratch. However, I use the battery/USB slots a lot, and neither has an opening where you can access them, so I would take the whole cover off every time I wanted to re-charge my battery or upload pictures. By month 3 of this abuse, it completely tore in half. So if you don't use the camera often and don't need to re-charge a lot, or if you're willing to modify the silicone case to your needs, go for it. I'm considering getting another one myself, but will definitely take an Exacto knife to it this time around."
1,Bad review,"I did not receive the right product, the advertisement said ""clear"" skin, not PINK skin. I was very disappointed!!"
4,"Powerful, uplifting, and eminently practical","Literacy & Libraries: Learning From Case Studies is a collection of true-to-life stories of library directors, teachers, tutors, librarians, and adult students who have seen firsthand the positive effect of adult literacy programs at libraries all over the nation. In addition to personal anecdotes, there are numerous persuasive accounts and advice on how to conduct and improve the invaluable public service of teaching adult literacy, from adjusting teaching methods to respond to a multicultural environment to teaching computer skills along with literacy. Powerful, uplifting, and eminently practical, Literacy & Libraries is highly recommended for library science students, as well as anyone involved in teaching adults the eye-opening, life-enhancing, crucial skill of reading."
4,"A Good Time Was Had By All, And It's A Pleasure Being Had","In contrast to most of Family's material, they chose more of a rollicking, good-time mood here: from the good-guy cowboy out to do right (title track), to an escaped convict ('Check-Out'), and the boy who uses a rich girl to get a cool car ('Leroy') in-between, the group is always celebratory. Even when the singer is leaving his girl ('Tea For Two'), he looks at the bright side: 'New start, new city....' While I have always found this album enjoyable since I bought it on vinyl in 1974, I would warn anyone looking for straightforward rock 'n' roll to consider that Roger Chapman's haggard voice and the band's nonderivative performance is pretty offputting for the uninitiated; however, after a few plays, they will be happy to join the fun."
4,Good book...but not quite...,"I bought this book to keep our daughter entertained through the slow parts at synagogue. The setup and so forth of the book is fine, however, the vinyl stickers don't stick...not at all. If you press them *really* hard they stay for a few seconds...I had expected them to stick similar to colorforms, but they didn't. The stickers come in a little case that snaps shut and is attached to the book for great traveling. Overall, it's a really good book with a minor problem..."
3,"Good song, bad package","This is great, great band and songs. but the one i got from Amazon was not in good quality. cover has bumps, but disc does'nt have any problem"
4,Perko Light Base,"Not not best in class as materials are not stainless but rather plastic and chrome. HOWEVER, it was a direct match for the base on my Chris Craft so didn't have to drill new holes. Glad I found this."
2,less than satisfying...,"I'm afraid this is the least satisfying performance of these fantastic works I've heard to date. The violin sounded weak and uncertain, the piano overwhelming and a bit bombastic, and the Ives idiom seemed missing thruout.Why oh why doesn't Philips re-release the Druian/Simms performances? So far, none have compared to those guys. OK, I haven't heard Thompson/Waters yet & am looking forward to that. And from what I heard over the web, Fulkerson/Shannon sound encouraging, if you have enough equity in your home to second-mortgage it - I also thought the Zukofsky one was OK, but again not comparable to Druian/Simms, and I gather also no longer available.Someone needs to rattle Philips' cage on this. I don't think it takes too many letters for them to maybe re-release. I'm starting right now. Join me?"
3,Young Adult Fiction,"I guess this was OK for what it was. I just didn't know it was written for young teenagers, so I was disappointed. If you want to teach your children about the evils of big government, then this may be the book for you. If you are a fan of Lawrence Watt-Evans' other books, then you are probably too old for this one."
3,Spartacus,"Spartacus File is co-authored by my favorite author Lawrence Watt-Evans and by Carl Parlagreco, a writer unknown to me. As with everything Watt-Evans writes, the story avoids cleche plot lines and takes the reader in a different and interesting direction. Start with a character who is plugged in to receive a computerized skill implant, add a computer glitch, and then go along for the ride in the rest of the story.I have been enjoying this book, but must admit that is isn't one of Watt-Evan's best. I'm not sure if this is by chance or because it is a collaboration with another author. In any event, I think this is an enjoyable read, but also would highly recommend all other books by Watt-Evans for those who enjoy stories that break the standard molds. Here are some recommendations:The Wizard Lord: Volume One of the Annals of the Chosen (The Annals of the Chosen),THE MISENNCHANTED SWORD"
2,What about the inner foil seal ?,"I just received my first order of parodontax and the two toothpastes don't have any inner foil seal. Is that right ? I want to make sure they were not used or open, before I try them."
4,great toothpaste,I have been fighting gum problems since adolescence and I finally have found a toothpastethat really help in the fight against gengivitis. The only thing I do not like about thisproduct is its price. It costs 3 times as ordinary toothpaste.
5,Excellent Air Cleaner,"We've been using the Honeywell 17000 HEPA Air Cleaner for over a week now and my husband said he notices a difference when he wakes up in the morning (not stuffy). I purchased it because I have severe dust mite allergies, etc.I keep the machine on high during the day (yes it's loud), but on low at night. I think it is very quiet on the low setting and does not bother me for sleeping. What was bothering me was the little blue power light, so I covered that with paper and tape (I need darkness for sleeping).Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase and feel that it meets the needs of cleaning the air of my bedroom.I would recommend it to anyone with the correct bedroom size listed, or smaller."
3,air cleaner,"I just received this item, the reveiws were saying this is very loud, but when compared to the older models. It is still only half the noise level on high. (It sounds like a fan) It dosent seem to suck the smoke in as well as the reveiws say it does, It seems to blow smoke up in the air instead in to the filter.Honeywell 17000 Permanent Pure HEPA QuietCare Air Purifier"
1,Honeywell 17000 air filter,"Have had these air filters before and they work. But, this time I tried to get the cleanable air filter that never needs replacing. Was trying specifically to order that type. I apparently did not. They said the two different types are identified, but I was looking, am a smart guy, and still made this mistake. So, I'd say, their labelling was unclear. Then I had to ship the filters back, at my expense, where they were going to be replaced, but when they got them, they refused. They will return them. So, now am out another $13 for shipping. Not to mention the hassle, and lack of use of the filters for over a month while I mess around with this stuff."
1,smells bad!,We had to return this because it put a bad smell out into the room. Never had this kind of problem with a HEPA air cleaner before!
4,Great HEPA machine..but a bit too loud!,"I use this HEPA machine in my bedroom 24/7. It's helped dramatically with my many allergies (I just found out the allergies are causing my asthma that I've had for 9 months).The only gripe I have with this machine is that it states that it's ""Quietcare"". On high, this thing is pretty loud!However, I had a more inexpensive model (I think it was Honeywell 50010) and it was deafening, so this is an improvement.Otherwise, this machine is giving me EXCELLENT results. I can sleep through the night without my eyes watering or dry mouth. It's improved my breathing (my family tells me 'I sound better') and helped with my snoring problems. At the price they're selling it for here, I'd pick one up. If noise bothers you just keep it on the low setting.It really is a good product!"
2,Nothing like the soothing sounds of a locomotive...,"This is a great design, nice look, and I was looking forward to getting this given the great reviews. So I purchased the unit. But gotdawg, even on low, it sounds like a dang wind turbine. I had also bought a larger Holmes HAP756 unit for my living room and the Holmes is WAY quieter on the lowest setting. I had to return the Honeywell because I don't like trying to sleep to the sounds of a typhoon."
4,I think it's good.,"Product was shipped in a timely manner. We use it all the time. I think it elworks pretty good, but I don't really know how to judge it. It runs and we think there is a difference."
2,Awful fish smell from air cleaner,We purchased this air cleaner about 4 months ago and suddenly it has a horrible fish smell. If you turn it off the smell goes away and as soon as you turn it back on the room starts to smell like fish. The filters have been replaced. I have never had this issue before with a Honeywell air cleaner.
3,"Can't say it's quiet, not very loud at least","loud at the high mode, acceptable in the bed room at the low modeexcellent in deodorizationsuper fast shippingconsidering buying their other products that are more quiet"
5,Love it,"Kinda loud even on low, but it cleans the air. Not the 1st choice on my wish list, but my son chose it because of some problem he had with my 1st choice."
1,It fell apart,It fell apart within one week!! I tried to put it back together but was unsuccessful. It didn't work that great before it broke.
1,not worth it,Slides off dryer easily.... the teeth breaks easily...its just not a good product if you plan to use it professionally...sorry
5,The best there is.,"I dare say the build quality of this device rivals Apple's products' build quality. This is saying a lot coming from a lifetime Apple fan.It is mass-storage compliant, so it mounts like a disk and is super easy to load up.The interface is a pleasure to use, and firmware updates are frequent and easy to install.The screen is delicious.It even comes with a nice leather case. wow."
4,"I love it so much, but....","I love my new PMP, ilove it, love it, so much. it works exactly as it says y the desctription, but one thing I didn't like was that they say in their web page that the cowon A2 is MacOsX compatible, and ithis is only for transferig files betwen your computer an the Cowaon A2, but the software included is not compatible, and that software is very usefull to convert video files that I download from the internet and are not compatible ith the Cowon A2 codecs, also this software can integrate subtitles to video and that is very usefull to me because as you can notice my first langage in not EnglishAlso I can say that some times y get my video freeze but I think that the file that is not good.I aplogize for my english, and Hope this review is useful to someone."
5,Terrific!,Just a terrific read . . .a refreshing adventure tale entwined with history that is hard to put down.
1,Not at all what I thought it would be,"I was expecting the movie to be a bit more of a documentary, but I found it to be an artsy and esoteric approach to older people and their experience of life. I was looking for something informative, for people's reflections on life and aging. The description provided for the movie didn't adequately convey, in my opinion, what the movie would be like. I found it inaccessible and forwarded through most of it. I experienced it as strange and unsettling. I would not watch it again, but this is one person's opinion."
4,very complicated,"This is a very complicated book. The two stories themselves not so much. Both Ulysses' and Olive's story are well written (olive's was a little depressing, but it was better written i think). Figuring out the connection between them is more the point of the book. The two strange sections (3 and 6) were really key to the whole thing. The essay at the beginning was pretty convincing as well. This seems to be the type of book that needs to be read a few times. All in all, i think it was great entertainment. In a hundred years it will probably be one of those 'masterpieces' that they make you read in school. Those aren't really my favorite type of book, but i think this is a good one. Its always nice to have a book to discuss, where mentioning it makes you look smart."
4,Need more John Frido,"John Frido is by far the coolest guy in the book. Who cares about the comma use, I'm talking character development here. This would have been a five-star book barring the drawn-out Olive portion... oh yeah... and more John Frido. There needs to be a book about just that guy. Ullysees is a sick character, John is too cool for school."
5,Positive Review,Book arrived promptly and in great shape. Packaged well. Would order from vendor again.
1,Find another source of information.,This book was not up to par with many of the other feng shui references. I was disappointed by the deceptiveness of the title and quickly lost interest.
1,A Thinly Disguised Attempt At Paganism,"I bought this book because I read and loved Clear Your Clutter With Feng Shui by the same author.I was horrified to find that this book is nothing more than a thinly disguised attempt at paganism. Part of the ""ritual"" of space clearing includes making offerings of food, flowers etc to the spirits.As a Muslim, this goes against my deeply held belief in One God. If you are a Muslim, Jew or Christian or believer in One God, please don't buy this book."
3,Not Motivating Enough,"I borrowed this book from the local library, and eventhough I had it for over a month and a half, I couldn't get myself to sit down and go through it as it wasn't motivating enough. I skipped through it, read a chapter or two, trying to get myself interested enough in reading it as I am a feng shui fan and strong believer, but still- couldn't care less about it.The way the writer introduces the information in this book is just too shallow. At points it is very complicated and tooo detailed, but at others you feel like you are reading a children's book on feng shui.You may like thos book if it actually motivates you enough to sit down and read it, but it didn't do anything for me."
5,This is a fun and useful way to create home harmony.,"I have been to Bali on several occaisions over the past 20 years, always fascinated by the beauty and harmony of the place. I also have been a student of shamanism, meditation, and indigenous cultures during this time. Nevertheless, I found the book a fascinating new perspective and highly useful. It provides a well written, concise, and logical set of directions for creating home harmony."
3,"Lots of good advice, and also lots of subtle arrogance","Love all the ways you can clear the energy in the space. Not to fond of rigid rules of how to do it and putting herself and Bali people on the pedestal. Of course they are special, and so is everyone. Of course balinese temple bells are special, and so is any bell, that deeply resonates with you.It is worth reading. Get it from the library first and then decide, if you want to buy it and keep it as a reference."
5,makes you want to clean right away,"It talks about how having an organize house will make your life better as different area in the house represents different part of your life based on feng shui. It got me so wired up that I kept cleaning stuff for last 2 months and am amazed at how much I have gotten rid of. It feels good and everything seems to get better. Even if it is just psychological, as long as it motivate me to do something about my life, I think it is a good book. I haven't done the really space clearing ritual yet, but just cleaning and de-cluttering has already made a profound impact in my life. I guess I just need to overcome the feeling of silliness of how the ritual looks one of these days when I feel ready."
2,"Too many ""shoulds""!","I bought this book because I loved (and highly recommend) the author's other book ""Clear Your Clutter with Feng Shui."" However, I was really disappointed when I read this book. Ms. Kingston does describe space clearing rituals used in other times and places, but her own space clearing ritual is extremely detailed and requires the use of specialized equipment which you can only buy from her. I think INTENTION is much more important in rituals than, for example, what kind of bell or incense you use.The other feng shui books I have read can be extremely limiting because they have so many rigid rules for what one can and cannot do. It's quite difficult to live with ALL those rules, and it's confusing because various authors contradict each other. I liked ""Clear Your Clutter With Feng Shui"" because it didn't make me feel constrained to do things ""the right way"" - but I found this book to be a let down, and I wish I had not bought it."
1,Definitely for an advanced reader on this topic.,"This book was one of three I ordered recently when I realized this was a subject I wanted to learn more about. As a beginner in this field, I found the book's instructions really complicated. I do not recommend this for beginners. I will however, recommend Feng Shui: Harmony by Design by Nancy SantoPietro for beginners and some advanced readers."
2,not what i was looking for,"i bought three books to begin familiarizing myself with feng shui. i was more interested in pointers on the basics of what to actually do. this one was a little too ""spiritual"" for me. i understand that's where it stems from, but it wasn't what i wanted from the book. ""move your stuff, change your life"" hit the mark for me, giving me immediate ideas of what to move/do rather than spiritual guidance."
5,Can't say enough good things,This book is awesome. It motivated me to start clearing my own clutter and prioritize what I choose to keep better. I have yet to do the actual space clearing process but it's got me a believer in the power of Feng Shui.
3,Interesting Book,"I'm not sure this is real feng shui, but it was really interesting to read. I like the author's new age mentality, but I also think she is trying to toot her own horn which is annoying."
2,Over-rated text book,There must be other French text books out there worthy of being used in a college setting than this one. Absolutely not worth the money. I need to use several books and online resources to understand the grammar because the book does not give clear examples.
4,Love it!,The book was in good condition. If I were to buy this at my school's bookstore it would cost me 85% more than the one I got here! Thanks alot!!
1,Fake-o,"Listen to me everybody: this CD is a pirated copy. Every good Utena fan knows that the Engage Toi a Mes Contes CD has 2 cds, not one. This is probably made by Son-May or ever-anime, who make pirated Utena cds. Do yourself a favor: don't waste your time with this. Go look for the real one."
1,Argghh! Here be pirates.,"As has been stated, any copy being sold here is almost guaranteed to be a bootleg from either one of the pirate companies Son-May or Everanime and will only be one CD. A legitimate copy will have two CDs and will come from Star Child/King Records with a catalog number of KICA 396/7. This catalog number will appear on the spine of the CD case. The first CD contains unreleased BGM and remixed BGM. Between these tracks are drama tracks of the seiyuu performing lines from the manga (including an appearance from Chiho Saito). This is the CD the bootleg is missing. The second CD is music from the Utena musical."
3,The first two tales in the funny Norby series.,"This book is a compilation of the humorous first two science fiction stories for children in the Norby series: ""Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot"" (first published in 1983) and ""Norby's Other Secret"" (published in 1984). The first tale introduces the reader to a 14-year-old Space Academy cadet, Jeff Wells, and his unusual robot, Norby. Norby has skills that other robots lack, apparently due to the incorporation of alien parts in his construction. In this first book of the series, Jeff and Norby foil a plot of a villian to take over the Solar System. Norby discovers he has ""anti-gravity"" capabilities as well as the ability to travel through ""hyperspace"" and great distances. [Isaac Asimov, in another book, apologizes for using antigravity in this series.] In ""Norby's Other Secret"" the robot discovers his origin, a dragon-inhabited planet, and some new abilities: traveling through time and telepathy."
1,"this is a spice mix, not actual harissa","beware - this is a spice mixture only, not actual harissaNot what I intended to order, but the ad wasn't clear.Harissa as I ate it in North Africa was a pulpy mash of peppers and spices, some oil. Fantastic stuff.I recommend Mustapha's Moroccan Harissa - it was terrific."
5,Nice sweatshirt!,"This sweatshirt is very well made. The fabric has a thick, ""heavy"" feel to it similar to the sweatshirts I was issued while wrestling in college. Definitely the type of sweatshirt used by major sports programs - it's built to stand up to strenuous workouts, repeated washings, etc. I am totally saisfied with this product."
2,"Nice book, but way too many typos","I love the 24 Hours of LeMans, and this is my first 'Official LeMans' book purchase. Whomever was the copy editor should be fired: too many weird/incomplete/runon sentences (some just make no sense at all), too many misspellings and lots of imcomplete information (example: drivers 'city' is not shown properly for some drivers)."
1,Not as advertised...,Does anyone besides Seabury Blair's friends like this book? Marlene Kocur liked it but she has also drew the maps for the book. Another reader gave it 5 stars but also happens to live on the Olympic Peninsula. Probably another of Mr. Blair's friends. If you give this horrendous book a positive review please be completely honest about whether or not the author happens to be a friend of yours. Blair has written a pamphlet for beginning cross-country skiers and then stretched it into a book by printing the same route descriptions over and over again. Then he slapped a cover on it to try and sell it to backcountry skiers and snowboarders. A quick perusal at the bookstand would make this obvious but on the web we don't have that luxury.
5,if you love Bryan Adams...,"This is an excellent greatest hits collection. I like the first cd best, but that is because it is all the songs I love."
4,BAdams,Great Album! Good collection of hits you grew up to. Some songs needed more of a rock edge than acoustics like version but great collectors item
5,Great CD,"This is one of those albums where you can put it on and let it play, no skipping certain songs, every one is great"
1,bad sound quality,"poor sound quality, bad mixing, garbled vocals. all from a great live band! what a shame. not recommended"
1,Too small..,This tub is by far too small to hold any decorations or more then one fish. My son was very disappointed when he got his aquarium. I would recommend getting something bigger if you are going to add decorations to the tank. We used it once and unfortunately the fish died a couple months later and we haven't restocked it since. If you are interested in getting an aquarium...keep looking.
2,beggers can't be choosers,"not exactly a rave review. this guide [,]actually[,isn't very good]but it is helping a little. I bought this guide because I needed dungeon maps. Okage's mapping system is asinine as anyone who has played it will know. And I was sick of fumbling around in the escapeless abyss practically blind. Well the guides maps are almost worthless. They don't show the details like which are stairs, where are the urns, where are the pits, but with sherlockian skill I was able to put these feeble maps to use. The town maps while more explicit are in such tiny type that you need a goldarn'd magnefying glass to see what the heck they say. Item lists and magic spell/monster lists are a little better although the item lists have descriptions such as :wonder what this does? Hmmm...well me too that's why I bought a guide. I hope prima's other products aren't this feeble."
5,Just what I need,Fits the Canon SD870 perfectly. The camera is not moving around in the the case but there's still room so it doesn't get hurt either.You can either flip off the top and have the entire camera in the case or leave the top cover behind and use it as a pocket. Either way is very useful.I wouldn't say the make is very decent if you take a deep look at it but it's already of the top-design at this price level.
4,"ipod touch case, works but...","Bought this case for my daughters iPod Touch, and it works fine for her purpose. She just want this case to transport her iPod when she does not need to access the screen. The issue is that if you want to do any thing on the screen you need to fully remove it from the case. As I stated this is not an issue for her."
4,a touching monument,"I have been obligated to oversee funeral preparations for my family plot. Being in a tight spot financially I was unsure of how to mark our eventual grave, and had decided to balance several stones atop one another, and then maybe adhering them with a homemade epoxy. Thankfully I came across this delightful little tomb. Looking at their smiling faces I am touched, and our family dignity is honoured. 4 stars!"
2,MASS CHOIR GOSPEL,"I wasn't impressed at all. One song, ""I'm Excited"" is a good gospel song and the rest of the songs are typical mass choir songs. The sound of the songs lacks that quality that we need to listen to in the house or your car. Hopefully their next CD will improve. God Bless"
1,Dead within one year of use,Totally dead within one year of normal use. It consumed too much battery. Had to change batteries almost every two weeks. Not recommended.
2,Avoid this mouse,"Beside all the drawbacks listed by others, i found that this mouse consumes energy too much. With two AA battery 500mah, you can only use mouse in maximum in one and half week for average use."
2,Not powerful enough,This mouse does not transmit as far as it should. Try something else if you need more than 3 feet.
4,good old school cd from Mr Winans,Great cd by the most underrated member of the legendary Winans family. Great vocals and songs by Daniel. You will enjoy this cd.
4,"Okay, but not the best",I liked the book well enough. Very realistic. But I don't know of ANYONE that whispers that much.
2,Ho hum,"This book was really dull! The people in it just kept getting mad at each other; at home, at school, in the car. It just went on and on without anything really happening. You are supposed to be able to relate to it and everything, but when I read a book I am not looking to read about something that happens every day! I don't know, maybe if you like reading about close-to-reality stuff you would like this book, but for me it was boring."
3,OK,"In the Friendship Ring Series, all characters have completely different personalities, Zoe's popular&one of the guys, Olivia is nice&polite, Morgan is tough&brave, and CJ is a fearful worrywart with the strength to fight for what she really wants. The idea in this book is great, and the character is fairly realistic, but some parts where she's afraid just drag on and on. It's a book some will like, and some won't."
3,"okay, kind of boring","After reading some others of the Friendship Ring series I figured that this would be just as good. Maybe I expected too much out of it, but I didn't really like it that much. It was soo annoying when she was scared and you just wanted her to shut up. She didn't act like anyone I knew or have ever known. And I don't get why she's popular. But, be the judge yourself, I could be different from you."
2,Ghost Hunter X: The Arizona Theater (2005),"The DVD was mildly amusing. It showed no paranormal activity to me. The ""Ghost Hunters"" said they were scientific but I find it hard to believe when their office is filled with New Age crap. They try to crack jokes and be funny but they seemed to try and let the guard down of the viewer and/or skeptic. They made a comment that as soon as they get the equipment set up, the ghost would hide. Apparently it did. The girls seemed to scream on cue when the ""Ghost Hunters"" walked down to the door ready to save them. The ""paranormal"" thing caught on tape appeared to be a bat with it's flapping wings. Either side of the object had movement like wings. The picture quality was poor with a lot of off tripod jumpy shots. About all I could say is that I got a good laugh."
4,Strangely funny and oddly fascinating,"The heck with ghosts, this thing is more about people watching than anything else. The two lead investigators are hillarious as they wonder around taking reading chatting about everything from science to bat droppings looking a bit like ectoplasm. It is really funny.The whole ghost part of this really takes everyone by surprise. They aren't expecting anything to happen and when it does in such a big way, the truly terrified and spooked reactions are something else. And that ghostly image the camerman got by accident is FREAKY!All in all it is a hillarious time spent with these humorous crumudgens."
1,waste of money,"Only the questions with answers in text have solutions. Solutions not complete enough to help if you are having trouble with the concept. Very disappointing, big waste of money. Useless. Wish I could return it"
2,Not that great,"I was surprised when I took this class that I did not like this book. All of my epid profs highly recommended this text. You have to flip back and forth when you are doing the problems because they list the SAS output that you need once in one chapter. I know it saves space, but this can get maddening. I did not find the examples clearly written at all-the lack of fit test, and some of the stuff about partial F tests could have used a few more sentences.No, I cannot write a glowing review of the text, but the only reason for the second star is because I also had a terrible instructor for this course. Perhaps if Dr. Kleinbaum had taught this to me, I would have a different perspective of this book. However, I was pretty much teaching myself this material, and this book is not designed for that."
3,Not my favorite,"This book skips some important basic concepts and has several poor, glossed-over explantions. I'd recommend Neter or Mendenhall."
1,Get Flatulina instead!,"This CD is not good. It lacks creativity or imagination. It's also rather gross. Get Flatulina's Fabulous Holiday Spectacular instead, it is far more creative and funnier."
5,Only book of its kind I know,"This is such a cool book!I've always been fascinated by languages and how their unique structures and sounds and vocabularies reflect whole histories of interactions with each other, and how each one still uniquely reflects the situations and traditions of a specific culture. And I've long hoped to find a reference listing every the languages of the world along with articles and maps and sidebars delving into who speaks what where when and for how long with whom.And then I stumbled across Mr. Dalby's work here, and I cannot express how impressed I am. The thing followed me around from room to room for a solid month, eating up my free time. The thing even includes minor and disappearing languages. I had no idea Irish Gaelic (my forefathers' tongue) was spoken by so few, or that literally dozens of third-world languages I had never heard of were spoken by so many.I could not have enjoyed it more."
5,"though old, better than the new stuff",i took my step 2 last december and the questions on the exam were very (!) close to the ones on this cd. comparable products (even though newer) seemed to be made for a different exam....to me the best source available.
5,white hot guitar blues!!!!!!!!!!,"There are some guys out there who play ""white boy"" blues and some that have soul and play blues the way it was meant to be played.Howard Luedtke is one of the few bluesmen left that hasthe soul of what blues music really is inside him.This album is probably the most raw recording of him, and in my opinion the best studio album. Howard is without a doubt the best slide guitar player in the midwest and when he plays you can feel raw emotion coming from his Les Paul.If you like gritty blues and slide guitar you owe it to yourself to check him out.the instrumental ""Howie's Boogie"" is one of the best tracks, ""Stranger Blues"" Is Great as well. What is really amazingis the resonater slide guitar song by robert Johnson: ""walkin Blues"".Howard's rendition is awe inspiring.This album is easily one of my favorites of all time!"
2,Let down :(,I loved the look of this umbrella but it did not last long. The mechanism that made it go up quickly gave out. It could have been a lemon but I still would not recommend this.
1,Why bother fixing typos?,"I was thinking of buying this book, but when I read that it is riddled with typos, I declined. Perhaps publishers will get the message that not doing proper editing results in lost sales."
5,Great CD!,"I first heard Mark Feldman on NPR's Fresh Air. I'm not always a jazz fan, but Mark Feldman gives his music a different twist that has made me a fan of his."
2,It was ok,This is your typical skateboarding movie that was clearly produced and shot by people who do not skateboard. Just like every other Hollywood skate movie
5,Dish Dogz,"this movie is excellent cinematography. and artists and a lot of very misunderstood outstanding performers. only if you are retarded or incult or illiterate will you dislike this pellicle. it has the best scenario, the best directing and the best music and the best actors."
5,A seminal work!,"Few authors have the skill of presenting biblical truth in such practical dress! Andy Stanley has hit a home run. I have read this book twice, a year apart, and have catalogued over 30 cross-referenced topics from its pages.From the Old Testament Book of Nehemiah, Stanley propounds 20 building blocks for discovering, articulating, and growing vision in personal life. The book has 18 projects, one following each chapter, most of which were personally helpful.While being a Bible based book, this work has direct practical application that will fit nearly any kind of vision in any field. It moves to that rare highest category in my library: a five star must read!"
5,Top 5 of All Time,This book is a must read for those men and women who are Christians and find themselves overwhelmed with big dreams in their lives. Andy does a beautiful job at helping others see and plan for great vision in their lives!
5,The Best!,"A friend loaned me this book the week before I was to make a major proposal regarding a vision the Lord had given me. It was absolute confirmation of the direction I was going and the best I have ever read on the subject. I would highly, highly recommend it to anyone who has the slightest fear about stepping out in faith!"
2,Not for me,"I bought this cd only 'cause I'm a Lifehouse fan and ""Good enough"" is a beautiful song. The other songs are fun but the rest of the cd is mainly a score by Alan Silvestri, and I really don't like this kind of cds."
3,Hello,"I purchased this item for my 1997 Honda Civic LX, It was missing these, so i though why not put some. It did the trick but it has one problem, the water goes all the way to the back trunk of my car and almost to the back of both my side doors windows. I did not remove them and send them back to amazon, i am just going to keep them there so I wont have to holes on my hood."
3,Great Return Service by Amazon!,"The first package I received was missing one of the spray heads. Not an expensive item, so I debated about returning the item or just using what I received. I decided to return the package and have a replacement kit sent. I found this process so easy through Amazon. What made this purchase nice was the fact that it was so easy to return defective or missing kits through Amazon on the remote chance it happens -- Thanks.By the way, the replacement kit was complete and works fine. It's just seems a little cheaper than original parts."
3,Cheap replacement that works.,"First of all, this nozzle does spray well and its a descent replacement for a missing or damaged window washer nozzle. but the bad parts are as follows:1. does not match existing nozzle (so you have to install both to match)2. it was a tight fit as it not really car specific3. my biggest problem, it sprays well, but leaves a puddle around the spray nozzle. I assume it leaks out as much fluid onto my hood as it sprays on the window.This last part doesn't bother me too much as if i'm using the window sprayer my car needs to be washed anyway. But if I don't wash soon then the sprayer leaves a large puddle on the hood of my car."
2,Dorman 47137 Windshield Washer Nozzle Kit,Item looked perfect. Need a few extra items to make it complete. Need something like a tweezer or fuse remover type tool for easy installation. The area were you need to put the nut is so tight on most vehicles that you can't get your fingers in there to hold the nut tight. Then you are screwed if you lose your grip on it.Also the nozzle isn't angled up high enough for my vehicle. Said this was the one to get for my 2001 Subaru Forester. But it only sprays the water solution 1/4 of the way up the windshield. But I guess at least it works better than before.
1,Inferior product,I purchased this product and upon installation the nuts used to hold the sprayers in place because immediately stripped and we had to find replacements for them.
4,Easy install,I had this installed and working in about 3 min. The only complaint I have is the nozzles aren't adjustable as far as I can tell so they spray a little low on my 2002 Xterra. Other than that they were worth every penny.
2,"Nice spray, lousy sprayers","Straight-forward installation, easy to adjust, perfect spray pattern. Then , after just a few days, the washer on one apparently broke and disappeared, so that nozzle started flopping around and became useless. A couple days later the pressure spraying from the other nozzle dropped almost to nothing. A couple days after that, the nozzle flew off mid-commute, because the plastic had snapped. All in all I got about a week's solid use from these."
2,Universal--NOT!,"If you intend to install these nozzles in a 2008 Ford Focus, you'd better buy the hose kit as well. But wait, by that time you've spent more than it would cost to get new OEM nozzles that would be a real easy repair. Hmmm."
2,how can i get my money back ...,"there is obviously a piece missing , there's only one nozzle in this packet....I should have read previous reviews ....not the first time someone complains .. the issue was resolved by amazon the same day ( Thanks amazon )"
4,Needs one more piece,"I was happy with the product. Everything worked well except that I needed one more piece: a ""T"" or ""Y"" fitting to finish the job."
1,No Instructions,No instuctions are included nor online from the company. Maybe the will send them through thought waves. Went into glove compartment.
3,Dorman 47137 Windshield Washer Nozzle Kit,I feel overall that its a decent product ... a little disgusted w/ the PLASTIC washers breaking??!!?Will most likely look for some METAL replacements!!!
2,Cheap!!!!,"The unit sprays to low on the windshield. You can only tighten the nut once, when trying to reposition the unit the nut stripped out the second time when tightening.Although the unit wasn't that expensive it time consuming installing it. The companion should make sure little things like it hitting the windshield at a good location is a must."
2,Great Image Quality - Poor Quality Control,"I bought two of these frames from CSCO. I was very impressed by the image quality (after I tweaked it with the onscreen menus). But when I loaded on all the pictures, the shuffle feature wouldn't work. I found in another forum that someone else had the same problem. Their customer service dept said that the firmware was corrupt. Both my frames had the same problem. Probably cause they came off the same pallet. So if you take the gamble, check it out asap and be ready to send it back."
1,Great image - but possible manufacturing defect,"When I powered up the unit, the screen was mirrored and upside down, as if I was inside the display looking out, while standing on my head.A call to Pandigital support was no help - they told me to return the unit as there was no way to reset it. I am worried that a replacement unit may have the same defect, as this could be a problem in the manufacturing process.The images did look great at the 800x600 resolution this product offers, they just were displayed incorrectly."
3,Brought lots of joy and lots of headaches,"After spending many hours trying to get the internal memory card to add/remove files, I look the dang thing back and ask for another one. The new one was the latest model, with memory card and power, etc. on one side. The control buttons are also fewer in number. I'm very pleased with this new model. My folks loved receiving this on their anniversary from their computer literate daughter/son, so it was worth the extra effort here for us. We set it up and they just turn it on/off. They will get to the point where they want to learn how to add pictures to a memory stick; and we will be there to help them!!"
1,DO NOT BUY! PRODUCT IS A RECTANGULAR FRISBEE!,"We bought this product and it absolutely does not work. It locks up windows when we plug it in with the USB cable; it freezes My Computer and eventually crashes the system. The connection is shaky and comes in and out. When I am lucky enough to have my computer recognize that something's attached to it the format is either unsupportable or a format is needed which--you guessed it--cannot be performed. IGNORE the company stooges who pose as customers and post five star reviews, this frame is PURE LEMON. If you're looking for a good digital frame, I can't help you but to say KEEP LOOKING."
2,Does not work with Gateway either,"I received this photo frame as a Christmas gift from my folks.Goods: Sharp picture, vibrant color, lots of different memory card slots.Others: Does not work with my Gateway laptop; no online customer support.I read the other reviews here on Amazon for this product, and apparently customer support is an issue with this company. I would not recommend this product."
1,Data Corruption,"If you would like to loose all you pictures buy this device. It corrupted all my photo's on my data card. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP"
1,Pandigital Digital Frames are JUNK!!! AVOID!!!,"My Pandigital brand 8"" Digital Photo Frame turned out to be a piece of junk. Even after hours of work with Pandigital technical support, it would not work properly. From day one, the ""slide show"" feature was inoperative. Several tech support people also hinted that it won't work properly on a Mac.My advice is don't be fooled in to a low price product like this one. At any price, Pandigital 8.0-Inch Digital Photo Frame is JUNK!!!"
1,A Great Disapointment,"I had high hopes for this product. Had previously bought a Phillips Frame and was very happy with the image quality. However, the Phillips Frame did not have a remote control, and did not play music or video. Therefore, I was anxious to try the PANDIGITAL frame.Received this product today and will be returning it tommorow! My computer would not recognize the device. There are no drivers provided with the product or available through the PANDIGITAL website. The documentation is extremely poor - both with the product and on the website. No information on what video, audio, or image formats the viewer is compatible with. I tied to play some AVI videos taken with a SONY digicam and converted to AVI's with Adobe Premiere - the frame crashed!To sum it up I would say - SPAMDIGITAL."
1,USB is flaky,"The frame has a lovely picture. The remote/interface is kludgy though, and the worst part is that I can't transfer pictures to the hard drive from my computer. The computer recognizes the frame as a hard drive, but then it locks up. We're returning ours."
1,Junk,"This frame is junk. I bought one for my mother who does not have a digital camera but has several pictures on her computer. The frame would not work with the USB on her computer or mine. So much for advertising the USB connection. Don't buy this, get something else."
1,Grainy picture,"I bought three digital photo frame in the past two months, and this one has the worst picture quality. The Pandigital 8"" was bought from a membership warehouse, and I just returned it. The frame itself has a sturdy construction, thought. It is easy to use. The slideshow starts as you turn it on. However, I think picture quality is most important, and this product doesn't compare."
1,Back It Goes!,"My Dell computer sees there's a USB device connected, but doesn't recognize it. Why couldn't Pandigital have an up to date device driver available? Second, my Olympus uses a Smart Media card, which is not compatible with Pandigital. Third, Pandigital claims its product recognizes a USB flash drive, but it didn't recognize mine.This product is worthless to me, so back it goes!"
4,Well Worth the Price!,"This is a great quality frame. The pictures are extremely clear, and you can adjust the brightness. It is compatible with most digital cameras, and it can connect to a USB (a plus that several other digital frames do not have). I give it four stars rather than five only because it run by AC adapter only. For a sleeker look, I would prefer battery-operated so as not to see the cord."
4,Not as bad as they make it sound,"This product works just as they state. Easy to use, straight out of the box. Uploads are simple, just like any other digital storage device. Picture is large, and very clear. I would definitely buy another one."
1,"Poor quality, poor warranty.","I received this as a birthday gift last year. I had no problems setting it up, and it worked fine for about eight months, then quit. I called the customer service, and after being on hold for 15 minutes, a polite gentleman said the LCD screen was dead, and that it was well beyond the 90 day warranty. Basically, my only option was to purchase a new one, and the customer service rep. wasn't even willing to recommend this option. While he was polite, I got the feeling he was tired of having to respond to so many complaints, so needless to say, I will not be buying another."
1,Not recommended for anyone who isn't electronic savvy,"The poor design causes your flash card to fall into the frame. USB was no good, had to go get another one. Had to format the frame because it had a glitch which meant downloading the photos to the frame again. And for the majority of the people buying these, who aren't electronic savvy, they will have a hard time following the vague directions. Having to copy photos one at a time to the frame could be made simpler with a batch download. It would definitely save time. truly, more thought should be put into this product. Either by Pandigital in making it user friendly or the consumer in their purchase of it."
4,This is Solid State Vol. 1,This is a great compiliation of the artist on the solid state records. It puts the power of harcore and heavier music right at your fingertips.
5,Great,"I have quite a few books and I compare it with my favorite which is Gone With The Wind, it is truley as good as this book, very intriguing and holds your interest so that you can't put it down until the book is done. She is an excellent writer and would like to see more of her work.Thank you"
2,Oops,"Great idea, but unfortunately, breaks easily. I bought one for a patient and she loved it, especially since it was clear. However, it has very little ""stretchability"" and after a couple runs in the dishwasher, broke in half."
2,DOES NOT FIT 11 in. PLATE AS ADVERTISED.,"The reason I purchased this item was to use it on a 11 in.; plate. To get it on a plate that size you would need the strenth of Hercules. If you were able to get it on, I suspect the extream stress would cause it to crack. I'm handicapped and my 75 year old care giver can't begin to get it on.It works just fine on 7 in.; plates, but that's not what I was looking for."
1,Plate Guard,I used this product twice and it worked great. The third time it broke in half. What a waste of $ 10.00
3,"Nice, but shortcomings.","Nice fryer. Had to return two Rivals-they quit either on the first use or the second.I really like the cleaning/drain system. Don't have to try to pour bucket of oil into bottle/can.Two related disadvantages though. The quick release magnetized plug at the back comes off too easily. Sometimes it looks connected, but it isn't. Have to wiggle it a little. Also, it only has a light that goes out when the operating temp is reached, not a power light. So, if your operating temp is reached and the power cord becomes disconnected, you can't tell the power is off when the temp falls below the proper operating level. I've had it become disconnected without touching/moving the fryer. This requires you to constantly wiggle the plug at the back to make sure the connection is made.I think for the next use, I'll try cleaning the contacts thoroughly."
2,Delonghi Cool Touch Fryer,"This product is unreliable. The one which I purchased, after being used 5 times over a two day period, self-destructed in an impressive fashion. It sat on a shelf for over a year, looking very efficient and practical, but that's where it ends. It lacks power, only 1,200 Watts, and the element is NOT directly immersed in the oil. It does stay cool and seems very safe, easy to clean - but don't waste your money. Very limited oil reservoir, less than 1 L. OK for deep frying small quantities of shrimp, that's about it."
3,Not a perfect guide for women in childbirth,"If you are a CHRISTIAN person looking for support and advice during pregnancy and/or delivery I would recommend ""Supernatural Childbirth"" over this book anyday. The info in this book is outdated and it's half secular/half Christian. Being a Christian I prefer something all Christian/no secular. Worth the read if it's just given to you."
5,"Please record more, Georgia!","Beautiful, soothing and another fine example of Georgia Kelly's timelessness. Eros & Logos will forever remain my favorite recording of her's. Stunning, soulfull."
3,"Ok, but not Great","not bad but the book is better, see my other review for the book: Introduction to glass fusing."
4,Your Choice: fight or flight and lose your life....,"You have a choice with Lupus...you can run from it and end up with more flares and illness than ever...Or you can embrace the wolf, ie: Lupus, and learn it's characteristics and all about it, thereby learning how to best fight it and so come out 'carefree as a butterfly'...as this author so very aptly tells us...the best way of fighting anything is to know it well and get under its' skin so to speak....by doing so ending up the winner in a fight for your life with lupus...a chronic, invasive, insidious and incurable inflammatory illness..one of the worst to enter our human condition, according to most specialists in the rheumatic disease field."
3,Morley A/B Switch,"I don't hear any noticeable affects on the sound. It's battery powered, but the battery is only needed to power the LED lights - so one 9v battery can last well over a year. It does have a problem with making an electronic pop sound when you switch from one channel to another. In some situations, the pop is barely audible. In others, it's cringe-inducingly loud. It seems to be based on the electrical situation of the room you're playing in."
2,REMOTE CONTROLLED LAMP,NICE LOOKING LAMP W/GOOD LITEMY ONLY COMPLAINT IS - - IF IT'S MOUNTED UP HIGH(AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE REMOTE) IT DOSEN'T WORK IF YOU ARE USING THE REMOTE AT FLOOR LEVEL.DEFINATELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!1
1,"Disappointed, Blue, boo-hoo...","My daughter and I picked this out, thot it would be fun ... really runny, be prepared ... she has blue spots on her scalp now (looks like a failed Trill joining or something) ... but only pale grey hair. I finally got it on her hair (partly lightened blond, partly dark blond ... we expected it to stick on the blond part easily enuf, since Splatz hair color does ... but ... it did not do that). Put a cap on her head, she sat with it for 20 mins ... not the recommended 30, not using heat ... but, literally ... NO RESULTS.Maybe if we had used heat as well as the cap ... I dunno ... we were both disappointed.As others said for other Jazzing products ... cream on skin, especially around hairline ... and maybe heat ... would have been a good idea.Good luck!"
1,Product NOT Gluten-Free,"The product description states that this tea is gluten free and that is incorrect. The tea contains roasted barley malt, which those with Celiac Disease cannot have. The label on the box even states that it may contain gluten. Be cautious when reading product descriptions on this website."
2,Hate the formula change..,I have drank this tea for years.. loved it and then I bought it again a few days ago and noticed right away the formula is changed. Now it tastes like chocolate/vanilla tea which I do not like. I'm stuck with five boxes of the stuff plus one box with one bag out of it. Just dislike the taste so much but I really need the milk thistle that's in it. Also I'm wondering just how much milk thistle it could have now that they've added all the other stuff to it.
3,Cute toy,It reminds me of the viewmaster. You have to look through the viewfinder to see images of Barbie. When you click the shutter button the image changes and it 'says' something. Cute toy for those who love cameras
3,"more laid-back than ""upon deaf ears""","""Building Rome"" is more laid-back than ""Upon Deaf Ears"" but probably also more mature. The vocals are more restrained, and the guitar riffs are slower. Overall, this is a good progressive rock/metal album with all the elements that prog fans would be looking for. However, there is very little distinctive about the CD. I would recommend going for the thrashier ""Upon Deaf Ears"" first."
5,Replacement Unit,"I can't complain about the durability of these sensors. I bought the original La Crosse weather station about 5 years ago while located in Texas. It has recorded temperatures as high as 113 degrees and since I moved to NJ 2.5 years ago, it has also recorded as low as 18 below. I'd say that's a pretty durable unit so had no qualms about buying a replacement when the original one quit recording humidity and bounced around on the temperature readings within short timeframes. I'm back and working now that I have this unit...I can't live without my weather station and the La Crosse is nice looking and works!"
2,"As previous reviewer said, two died, there won't be a third.","I've had these for a few years. They are quite picky as to where you place them, at least with our stucco walls, or their signal doesn't reach the base station. I've had them fail to reach my station from as little as 10-15' away. Two TX4Us have died on me now. There will not be a third.Any time the batteries expire in a sensor, or the station, you have to reset the station, which is a cumbersome process, and you lose all your historical data like high/low temperatures as well. I've always questioned the accuracy of my TX4Us. The inside base station does seem to be accurate though.I would not purchase a La Crosse weather station product again, based on my experience with this one."
1,Temperature and Humidity Sensor,I did not need this item and returned it immediately. They gave me now hassle but were very courteous and gave me credit on my credit card within 3 days. I will buy again from this firm.
3,"Accurate, but for short distance","Ease to set up to the weather station, but with two brick walls between transmitter and receiver, do not reach 30 feet!"
1,"My opinion is that it is cheaply made, poorly designed, complicated to set up, junk.","I got one of these for Christmas from my wife. This is a toy at best. It was awkward to set up and lasted two days. It is cheaply made and not user friendly at all. I can't believe that someone would sell such a product. This is my opinion of the whole weather station from LaCrosse. I have worked in electronics as an Field Service Engineer for over 25 years, so I understand electronic equipment. Based on the ""toy"" weather station that I had, I would not spend my money on any of their products. They may make good products, but my first experience with LaCrosse Technology was not good at all. It is on it's way back to Sam's Club. The TX4U listed on this page is the part that failed, that is why I am posting here."
1,La Crosse TX4U Wireless Temperature and Humidity Sensor,Product did not work with receiving unit. this is the second receiving unit that I have purchased from LaCrosse that did not perform after one year. I am now purchasing my temperarure and humidity devices from Oregon Scientific.C. Black
3,Wireless temperature sensor,"Item does finally work after weeks of trial and error to the base unit. Acuracy seems very good though, although the unit that I received was not as pictured. I am not sure the reason but hope that it is weather resistant since the location mounted is where it is exposed to all of the elements."
5,Great Product-Get it,I ordered this sensor to go with a very old La Crosse Unit after the old sensor had been dropped I can't count how many time. We never fixed it to a spot after three years of use and kept droping it off a brick wall three feet high bringing in the groceries etc. It is extremely accurate as is the unit and even the forcasts are bang on. I highly rate this product.
1,"Fragile, Short Life Span, Really Short Distance","I've gone through 2 of these sensors already. There's not going to be a third. The litany of excuses the company has for the sub-par performance of these things is long and exhaustive--unbelievable.Ok, for the people that have just bought these and hooked them up and they work. Oh boy, it works, just like it supposed to do. I've been using this product for about 3-4 years and I've gone through 2 sensors.Basically if you want this to work right you have to have it out of the sun, out of the rain and in direct line of site to the base station not going through any walls and hopefully not going through any windows. Give me a brake!My suggestion; go with another brand!"
4,Voices from Another Place,"As the older sibling of a Korean adoptee, I still remember the delight of welcoming my sister into our home 47 years ago. That was before the adoption of anyone in this book! Yet there were things I did not know, especially about the Korean culture. Not everything in the book applied to my sister, whose biological father was American. Each story is unqiue. Yet I have grieved with her over the losses and the special challenges that this book validates. It helps me know how to talk with her more. It helps me see her as a super survivor and to better understand the difficulties my parents had in understanding her needs. How I appreciate all who helped to tell the collective story!"
2,"More, please","Korean (and international) adoptees have so few venues for telling their stories that I hate to knock this one down. However, the stories fall into a dreary predictable sameness. Instead of highlighting how each adoptee is unique and how our stories can't be boiled down to a simple myth or stereotype, these stories don't have enough energy and ""spark"" to engage the reader. A notable exception, though, is the ""Calling Card after Adrian Piper"" which is a bilingual explanation why Korean adoptees who visit Korea can't speak Korean. I'd like to have some of those made for when I'm in Korea."
4,The opinions of Batman and Robin on crash tag team racing,"Hi I'm Robin! Crash tag team racing has a lot of action. No, you can't save the world but you can do my personal favorite, stunt arena! Stunt arena is where you can go on ramps and do flips and variels, you set a time limit and at the end whoever did the best tricks wins. To make stunt arena more fun you can go to the gift shop and buy new arenas. For racing you can also buy tracks. You can do battle arena to, in which you ride on another persons car with a canon and take down your friends. The graphics are awesome! Now that he's returned from saving the world, Batman will share his opinion.Hello,I am Batman,my untrusty sidekick and I both have lots of fun racing and doing stunts. The Grandpix is my favorite. There are a few races in Grandpix. If you press Y you clash with a racer.Oh-no,the joker is coming,I have to go."
5,Great Read,Another fantastic story from James Axler. The Deathlands series continues to impress. West coast barons with loads of fuel makes for great corruption in the post-apocolyptic US.
3,Fry and Panasonic have terrible customer support,I ordered this Camera from Fry's online. It arrived with no AC adapter. Fry blamed it on shipping at Panasonic. They wanted to charge me for another one and return the one I had. I can not even take it back to a local Fry store. I am told by customer insult that they are 2 different companies.The worst part is neither Fry's or Panasonic have a forum to rate their support or their products. They can continue to provide terrible service and no one will know any better.I applaud Amazon for having this forum. I will order this camera through Amazon. I will also order all my online electronics at Amazon.
1,Horrible cameras,I was so impressed with the reviews here that I bought 3 cameras all at once. I was so very disappointed that I returned all 3 the next day. The picture quality is very bad and the accompanying software was just as bad.I recommend the Trendware USA TV-IP300. I have 3 of them for about 4 months now and are still very satisfied with them. (This time I bought one camera first to test before buying the other 2.)
5,Great Camera,"Bought 2 of these to watch over my house while I am at work. Setup is pretty easy, but be prepared to wait a minute after changed settings, many changes when you initial setup the camera require it to restart. Camera's work great together and the free use of [...] to access the cameras is nice. Setting up timers and sensor emails/ftp is pretty straight forward but will require a user to test and retest to get the settings just right.Pros: Price is good for a ip camera with tilt/pan. viewnetcam.com feature is a great addition to the camera package. Works great with similar model panasonic cameras.Cons: Multiple restarts while setting up or making changes(minor issue), limited online support/how-to's."
5,Panasonic webcam is easy to use and cheap,"You get a lot for the money. Easy setup, automatically negotiated with lynksys router, external website activation and monitoring worked first time. Still trying to figure out how to get it to send me an email of the picture when an event triggers. I may buy the wireless version next since this one was so easy to install. I routinely check my front walkway from the office. Great for checking on packages being delivered."
1,Died After A Few Years - JUNK!,"Had this camera for a few years. Setup is ALWAYS a pain in the butt. No matter what or where. Quality of the image is poor. Support folks have odd ways of ""helping"". Now, after a few years, something seems to have failed inside even though it says it's working fine.Complete e-trash! BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1,This version has no Pictures!,"A.& C. of M. is a fantastic book indeed with it's ""ancient"" coverage of medical anomilies in one place!! It also had a brief cameo in the movie ""The Breakfast Club."" However this version of the book (Blue Unicorn Press) has none of the original pictures of which there were over 100 in the original version (late 1800's) and in the reprints during the mid to late 20th century. Unless you only want text, this version may not be for you."
2,The Kindle version falls short of the real book,"Maybe I expected too much from a free book but the price was right so I tried it. Unfortunately, it does not compare to the real book which happens to be one of my all-time favorite books. I shouldn't have expected it COULD compare because, for one thing, there are no photos (at least in my Kindle version). Buy the book. It's a great book. This version is only good if you know the book by heart."
4,Read it in 1.001 nights,"I'm not quite sure why I ever picked this book up; I'm certainly pleased that I did.Unlike an earlier reviewer, who had definite ideas about the pigeonhole into which this brief (just over 200 pp), deliberately elusive book fits, even at midpoint I was quite sure I had no idea what the author's 'objectives' might be - & little hope I'd come upon one.And then I re-considered the title. And raced toward the conclusion.Truth in book reviewing: this is a guy's review, by a guy prone to longwindedness. Not this time. Suffice to say that midway into this book I finally caught a whiff of its subtle perfume. & now I'm eager for more of Ms. Mernissi's work."
1,"Author needs to travel more, read more books","I enjoyed ""Dreams of Trespass"" the author tries to follow it up with a book written on her book tour. This ends up being a disaster, this is the writers first trip to the West, her history, and knowlegde of the West is zero. She spent her childhood school years just memorizing the Koran. Despite her degrees in history, her history of the West is very poor. When introduced to the writngs of Kant, she assumes that he is still a role model on the philosophy of women in the western world.The saddest part is when she writes about her collegue Kemal, no matter how much he abuses her verbally, she always crawls back for his approval, while trying to tell us how liberated she is.I feel sorry for all her fears, and she has many, having crossed roads, that thank god, I didn't have to cross.So give this book a skip, hopefully the author made enough money on it to travel a bit more and read alot more before she writes another book about the West"
2,not very good anymore...,"I bought these speakers about a year ago, and they worked SUPER well until I packed them up to move. From the point that I unpacked them they made a consistent (and loud) crackling noise that really effects the sound of the music. Not only that, but now I am unable to make the speakers go any louder than low volume. These started out well, but with a little stress on them they completely crapped out."
4,great speakers,I like these speakers a-lot pretty amazed by the sound that comes out for the size. I wish they had a remote controll though.
1,Junk!!,"Have purchased fine audio all my life; thought I found a good deal. The volume is not good, subwoofer is worthless, and one speaker is shot right out of the box. Overall sound is truly bad. I do not like bashing - but this is JUNK!! Calling in the a.m. to return it!!"
2,Computer Sound Speaker System,I ordered this speaker system with my new Dell Computer. I have not been pleased with this speaker system. After about 6 months it developed an echo. So now whatever computer sounds that I listen to are produced with an annoying echo.
2,Poor Transition into Algebra and High School Math,"This book is commonly used by grade schools as a transition for students to get acquainted with algebra topics and prepare for high school math courses. Sadly, this book is poorly laid out, skipping back and forth between topics like a ping pong ball, and often pampers the reader to an extent of which is clearly childish. Even grade school students who were polled often find the pictures both useless and distracting. The chapters of this book also waste space, while providing very little mathematical content. If you are reading this book, or thinking about getting this book for a school environment, you should seriously consider that this book in no way prepares students for high school math courses. Why 2 stars then? The overwhelming use of pictures and comics to portray mathematics may provide easier to understand concepts for children with learning disabilities; but is often distracting."
1,Yet another waste of my time,Poorly packagedPoorly shippedNo clear communication with the buyerThis experience was empty hallow and left me empty in the pocketbookwhat a waste
4,Nice Powerful Dryer,"Received the dryer in a timely manner from manufacturer offered through Amazon.The dryer is holding up well in my home.I have 4 daily users-all with medium to long thick hair.The dryer makes quick of drying hair. It comes with attachment for styling.It is very powerful. No real issues with accidental on/off switching while drying hair. The dryer has a 9-ft long thick power cord. No tangling and plenty of length to be mobile while styling hair. There are 2 fan speeds (High,Low) and 3 temp choices (Hot,Warm,Cool) w/ a cold shot button. I would have like to have seen a third choice (med) on fan speeds. The noise factor of the dryer fan is good. Cleaning the air filter is a snap. The dryer stays cool to touch in use. The ionic works. We have really noticed a reduction in static charged hair. Especially now that we are in the winter months and home heating is needed. We highly recommend this dryer. Definitely worth the extra money spent."
4,Great Hairdryer,"Really like this hairdryer. It makes my hair shinier and straighter than non-ionizers. The switches on the handle do require a different positioning of my hand to avoid turning it off, so it loses one star for that."
3,Overpriced,"This product was decent, but overpriced. The coconut aroma was OK, but mediocre. The lather was not as intense as some of the other Trumper shave creams. And the price was excessive for what it is. If you want to spend the money and use Geo. Trumper products, I suggest you pick another one, unless you absolutely must have one with a coconut aroma."
5,What a Stress Tamer!,"This is a hard-to-find type of tea...most supermarkets don't even carry the milder version, Tension Tamer and I'm so glad that Amazon does. Tension Tamer Extra simply relieves/soothes my nerves, especially on those high-work-volume type of Mondays & Fridays. I have at least two bags a day to get me focused, to get me going & to help me cope wih stress. Being a single parent is really not that easy. Thank you Celestial Seasoning for coming up with this idea and thank you Amazon for stocking up!"
5,10 minute vacation (for everyone within shouting distance),"It's full-flavored and sweet without being ""fruit-y"" (I don't add sweetener or anything other than hot water); a delicious way to take a 10 minute vacation. But, frankly, I'd say that about any yummy bagged tisane. I just mean: This blend is particularly tasty; the bags are a convenient and clean way to brew.I haven't noticed any ""wellness"" advantage in my own health, but my pal & co-worker discovered my stash and tried some. This determined ""caff-head"" is now drinking herbal! So you understand: Once I offered her a beverage with the sing-song inducement, ""It's uncaffeinated""; to which she retorted, ""Uncaffeinated! Do you even know me?""Not surprisingly, she's now a shade less belligerent in the PM (still needs her morning joe). Hey, now that I think about it, this means I DO have improved overall health as a result of ""Tension Tamer Extra""; hosanna! Thanks Celestial Seasonings!"
4,Very Helpful Book,"This is a very good book for both beginners and more experienced scroll saw enthusiasts. There is very little about the use of scrolls saws that is not covered in the book, which has lots of good tips and suggestions for using a scroll saw to maximum advantage. My only complaint is that about a third of the book discusses various models of scroll saws that were available in 2002 but have since been replaced by newer models. Still, this is a minor complaint when the overall usefulness of the book is taken into account. Strongly recommended."
3,"Good, but don't expect so much...","Nice, but there is a lot of other shirts more beautiful than that..."
1,The batteries I received are different from the photo...,... and they don't recharge with the sony charger I have at home.You should pay more attention to the photos in the product profiles.
3,Didn't Fit,"I have worked with this product in the past and had great success with it. It works WONDERFULLY to diffuse light. I love it!That said, I was really disappointed that it did not fit my standard-sized flash, no matter how much I wiggled and stretched it to get it on. Make sure to try it out on your flash in a camera store before you order!"
4,"Works pretty well, but very big and bulky","Title says it all. It is a great diffuser, fits wonderfully into my SB600. It is just HUGE. I have a large camera bag and this thing takes up more room than my camera body. it also prevents my flash from resting at a 90 degree angle, it tilts up just a couple degrees.....which has been an issue from time to time."
2,Decent but....,"I have yet to try it on a wedding. Tried it for low lit, average height ceiling conference and I'd rather have my flash hitting the ceiling or thrown behind me at full power. Outside during late afternoon if was worthless to me, it gave a weird colorless cast on my subjects.www.joycheriephotography.comif it doesn't work for a upcoming wedding I'm returning it."
3,it works well.,"The product works as described, which is of course what it is supposed to do. However the fit of this item onto the speedlight is poor. Yes, I did buy the lightsphere specific to my speedlight. Worse yet, the lid does not fit with any security. When facing forward,it WILL fall off, making you spend as much time picking it up. Save yourself some bucks, and cut a hole in the bottom of a wonton soup container."
3,So-so!,"The dome works but not as ""phenomenal"" as it was described in the commercials. works the same as an ordinary diffuser."
4,Good Product,This is a very good value. I use it to put in many Asian recipes instead of chicken or vegetable broth. The result is a more authentic Asian taste to my recipes.
1,Don't Buy -- Dreadful!,"I like Japanese soups and just love the similar products from San-J (also available from Amazon -- get those, they're 5-star!).This Miso-cup brand is terrible. I can't tell you more than this is just yicky. I wish there was a zero-star rating!I didn't finish the first cup even (but I'd already tried and re-tried another Miso-cup flavor and hated it). Therefore, I only used one envelope before giving away the rest. Oh, why did I stray from San-J? Actually, I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cup's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience. It was this flavor, in particular, that I was most interested in trying for variety. But now I know that ALL the Miso-cup brand are equally dreadful!!!I gave these and the other Miso-cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them. Get the San-J brand!!!"
2,A Disappointing Sequel,"Not nearly as good as the brilliant ""Cut To the Quick,"" this disappointing sequel suffers from an unbelievable romance involving protagonist Julian Kestrel and an unsatisfying climax. It's interesting to read about 1820s London, and Julian is still an appealing protagonist, but the plot flaws (and for some readers, the sordid topic) make this one more of a disappointment than a pleasure."
3,O.K. Addition to the series,"The plot is a bit strained and the relationship between the main character and the prostitute seems a little contrived, but overall an acceptable period mystery."
2,Not as good as the first,"Julian Kestrel is still an interesting character, but I found the plot here stretched my credulity to the breaking point. If the murder victim was so stupid as to act as she did, she was asking for it! And the ""romance"" between JK and the ""hooker with the heart of gold"" was a credulity strainer too."
5,"A beautiful, reassuring book for children","Every child adopted from an orphanage anywhere in the world--and every friend of every child adopted from an orphanage--should have this book in her or his collection. The photographs are simply gorgeous, and the main message--that orphanage caregivers (usually) do their best for the children in their care and want them to have a family to love and care for them forever--is immensely reassuring. Books like this one help all children understand what adoption is all about. Give one to your children, your children's friends, your children's teachers, and your local library."
5,"Excellent, excellent book","This is the most interesting and informative book I've seen yet dealing with adoptions through Vietnam. A very thorough book that has the most striking photos. Of course I had to take a number of small breaks to keep from tearing up too much when I read it out loud to my three boys. If you are adopting from Vietnam, this is the book you want."
4,Written from a unique perspective,"This book depicts the life of a young orphaned girl in Nazi Germany during World War II; from the perspective of the Grim Reaper... not in a creepy way... just very unique. While the theme of the book is sad, it does have its uplifting moments and aptly portrays the goodness that exists between the cracks of evil. The book is a quick, easy read. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I felt it was written ""simply"" and could have used a little more depth and complexity.I still enjoyed the book and am glad I read it."
2,Seriously?,"I read around 50 pages and gave up!I've recently read quite a few novels about Nazi Germany, really good books, I may add, and this one I found SILLY!Maybe it's intended for young adults which I'm definitely not, and I found Zusak's approach to serious matters almost ridiculing and quite ridiculous!Sorry Markus!"
5,A New all time favorite!!,A book club read - I was hesitant to read a narrative by Death himself - and I put the book down a few times in the very beginning ... But as the characters took shape and background story emerged - it was difficult to put down. What a heartwarming story in so many ways even with the backdrop of Nazi Germany and all of the sad events noted. This is a new all time favorite read ...
5,Amazing Read,"You won't want to put this book down until its done, I didn't! Amazingly well written in an innovative way. My mother had bought it and I read it during an extended visit. I loved it so much I went home and bought my own copy."
5,Recommended!,"The book is about Nazi, which is my favorite topic in history. Sad but touching. Love how the author organizes the story. It is a little long for me. But as a non-English speaker, this book gets rid of my obstacles and brings me into the book. Thanks for giving me this wonderful story."
5,Fresh perspective,This ebook was so refreshing and amazing the characters are well developed and easy to get in to. Inspired and witty!
5,Another side of death,"This book is so different. It was probably written for those far brighter, but once finished, I had a feeling of fondness and appreciation. Death as a sensitive being is a first. I think the little rays of light that existed in Liezel's life, her step father, her jewish friend in the basement, her boyfriend and especially her books, made her life meaningful in such a crushing environment like Nazi Germany..this book is a must read because of it's unique style..even readers like myself are a little brighter for having done so."
5,The Book Thief,Great book. I read it in one plane ride from NJ to CO. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good book.
5,A Compelling Read,"I couldn't put this book down. It is written from the perspective of 'Death' during WWII Nazi Germany. It is one of the rare books that I actually felt moved enough to cry. This is a wonderful book, the writing is eloquent and so descriptive that it draws you right into the book. A must read."
3,The Book Theif,"First off, I would like to say it was a good book. It was very difficult for me to put it down, I finished it quickly. One of the things I didn't enjoy, however, was how pretentious it seemed much of the time. This was in the style of writing and Death's narration. All of the***HEY IMA TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS NEXT***AREN'T I SO POETIC?stuff really bugged me. I mean, I'm oaky with the storyline itself being out of order, but not with the narrator telling me what's gonna happen to ""soften the blow"". The whole point of the book was to get to your feelings, which could've been done better without all the little snippets. At points it worked well, and in the end I really enjoyed this story, I'm just not a huge fan of the writing style."
3,Maybe I don't WANT my life changed...,"In the past week I've read two reviews that tell me that ""this"" book could be ""life-changing"": The Book Thief and The Stranger. Here I am still working at this same boring PC which skips letters....neither world peace or brotherly love has arrived yet. I thought the plot was pretty standard and using ""Death"" as a narrator became more of a gimmick than an effective tool. Not to disappoint the person who recommended it I plugged away for over 300 pages but did not discover any new galvanizing truths."
5,A Book that Stands Out,"This book is narrated by Death, taking place in the life of a fourteen- year old girl named Liesel. Liesel had to be adopted, along with her brother, by the Huberman's, a family in the town of Munich, Germany to get a proper education. In the train ride to get to Munich, her brother died.This book takes you through the times of Nazi Germany in the sense of just being in a war, rather than a race issue always used in world war two books. This unique factor makes it the best world war two book I have ever read.This is an excellent book that most definately deserves more than five stars."
5,The Book Thief: Review by an 11 year old,"This is one of the best books I've ever read, and that's saying something, considering I've read 137 books this year. Markus Zusak uses so much figurative language that it's almost poetic. I really feel connected to Liesel (the main character) unlike some other books I've read. I probably would give this a 4-star review, but the fact that Death is the narrator sends it over the top. 7 out of 5 stars!"
2,Amazed at the hype.,I read this book for a book club. It was OK. But that's all. I like a book with a satisfactory ending and I didn't find that with this one. It was not laborious to read but it just didn't move me. The funky narrative was OK but I kept wanting to compare it to Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and it just didn't hold a candle. The similes and metaphors were way overdone and most just didn't make sense! I also didn't care for the foreshadowing. It seemed to want to put my mind at ease but what it ended up doing was just easing the tension. I don't want the tension eased when I read a book! I'm sorry but not a book to remember in my opinion. Diary of Anne Frank is not fiction and that is what makes it so compelling. The one thing I did like about it was the viewpoint of Nazi Germany from a non-Jewish perspective.
5,Strangely - Death Is Great Company.,"I was given this book as a present. Although the title grabbed me, when I read the bIurb on the back I was a little disappointed with my gift. (I thought reading about a young German girls trials and tribulations during World War Two, would be a tad been there done that)Boy, was I WRONG, with a capital W. As soon as I reluctantly started reading the first page I was captivated.The Book Thief is delightfully written.I breathed in each sentence, anticipating what would happen next.I thought the unlikely relationships that were formed in this story heartbreaking, beautiful and yet so human. WOW.I love deaths attitude. His wisdom, his denial and his sense of irony.This is a beautiful book. A must have. I enjoyed reading every page.It's a fantastic book. I loved it."
5,"Fiction is just that, made up!!!","Comparing this novel to nonfiction accounts of the Holocaust is ridiculous. The point of the novel is not to be entirely historically accurate. If that is what you are looking for look elsewhere. This novel over and over again makes you think and reflect on what you have just read and experienced. I often sat with the book on my lap reading and rereading a line trying to extract all the different ways it could be intrepreted. Death as a narrator has the potential to be gruesome but instead just adds to the impact this book had on me. I teach the Holocaust yearly to middle schoolers and always focus on how this could happen and how each person's actions or lack of action contributes to such attrocities. I wish I could purchase each of my students a copy of this novel. It does show the power of words and one person to change things, to move mountains."
5,Book Thief,"When my book club selected this title I was more than a little skeptical, especially since it was written in a very different style than I was used to and billed as a 'young adult' book. Once I started reading it I became swept up in it. It was very interesting to view the events of WWII Germany through the eyes of German people who were not captivated by Hitler's rhetoric. It is easy to forget there were brave souls who, in their own ways, protested his iron rule, often risking their own lives and comfort to do so. The Book Thief would be an excellent companion to The Diary of Anne Frank. This book should be a must read for every adult and young adult. It is a book that stays with you long after you have finished the last chapter."
5,Hard Choices Under Impossible Circumstances,"After reading this book, it took me two weeks to fully digest what I had read. What is this book about? Is it a book about war? Is it a historical book? Perhaps. But ultimately the book is about choices. When evil assails a family from every side, its members are forced to decide whether to conform or resist. The Hubermans are not a perfect family, but when faced with the choice to accept a foster child whose mother is in prison, or to honor a promise to a friend, or give a crust of bread to a starving prisoner, they always find themselves making the unpopular choices, the choices that seem to bring them ever closer to their demise.Death, who narrates this tale, notices Leisl (foster child of Hans Huberman) and records the story of her struggles and those of her foster family and friends. This is a well-written and thought-provoking book. It is one of the best in holocaust literature for young adults."
5,for young adults and gripping for older readers too,I was surprised by the caliber of the writing and the love and death mixture of Nazi Germany and the hate towards the Jewish population. It is not a sentimental story but a very human one. Good way for young people to learn about the Holocaust. D.I.
4,The Book Thief,"The format of this book was a bit daunting in the beginning but as I got into it I began to enjoy it. Not one of the best books ever, but nevertheless interesting abd worth the time spent. I have read quite a few books on WWI, the Jews and persecutions. This one gave a different viewpoint and although it is fiction, the conditions it describes were believable."
3,You may not like it despite how well it's written.,"Don't feel badly if you don't like this book. It's dreary. Its history is already written. You know where it's going. It's beautifully written and artfully as well - but at the end of the book you arrive exactly where you thought you were going to - and I would have preferred something more uplifting along the way before I got to that ending. For some, the story is enough. This is where a matter of taste comes in.I have read many books written about this period of time but for me, this particular story was an unnecessary return visit to despair and the quiet horror of the reality of the times. I would never recommend it for a child even though the ugliness is certainly presented conservatively."
3,Weird,This book was very different. Both interesting and a little disturbing. I also liked the German words because I am studying German.
5,A Master of the Written Word,The author's use of language is poetic. His descriptive sentences went beyond the mere telling of a story in that emotion is felt in every word. I will certainly look for other books by this author.
3,Bookthief,An interesting look at what it may have been like to be an average German (not Nazi party member) during World War II.
2,The Book Thief,Very hard to read. The story is good but written in a very fragmented way. I would not recommend it.
3,Good,"This was a good good book. Its not the first book that comes to mind when I am recommending books to anyone. Overall, its a good book and you can't go wrong."
3,a new treatment (for children) of the Holocaust and World War II in Europe,"The Book Thief is a fresh, new offering on this important topic for kids, who have up until now largely had straightforward (if often wonderful) treatments like Number the Stars. I wasn't crazy about the premise of having Death narrate; I didn't feel the voice was needfully created. But the impression the book leaves is strong, and the reminder of the hardship of civilian life during the war is powerful and nicely done."
3,Interesting but forgettable,"I love that this novel did not focus on the Jewish people, but rather the German people and a child at that. But, the death narrator bothered me a lot as my mind began to wander about him ... like, if he's death why does he have to physically climb through windows, why is he telling me the ending, why is Leisel so special that he chose her to write about, etc. He also seemed to put distance between me as reader and the main characters. The result was that I felt little for these characters, interesting as they were. It was very well-written and had a great plot, but Mr. Death ruined it for me."
1,Not for me,I did not like it at all. I would not recommend it to anyone. I only made it about 30 pages in and deleted it from my kindle.Weird book. I give it a zero rating because they do not have anything lower than that. Save your money.
1,Couldn't even finish the book,This is the second book in my life i haven't finished. I tried and tried but just didn't get hooked and eventually had to move on.
1,The Book Theif,I did not like this book. It was hard t o follow.i am a fast reader and I had a hart time with this book
3,"I liked it, but wouldn't read again.","The amount of five star reviews on this book is not surprising because it was an interesting and engaging read. The story is written in a style I have never encountered before and I was engrossed throughout.The reason it gets a three star review from me is because its not a book I'd buy, put on my book shelf and read over and over again.Was it good? Yes.Did I enjoy it? Yes.What it original and unique? Yes.Would I read it again? Not likely."
5,One of the very best in recent years,What else can you say that others already haven't? This book is a phenomenal read - not just in the story but in the prose and the character build up. The unique aspect for me was to read a book about the Holocaust from some German families' persepctives. I can't imagine forgetting this book anytime soon.
4,Great for young adults or not-so-young adults :-),"Loved this book! I could have kept reading had it been twice as long. A quick read. Having Death as a narrator is so unique and it was interesting to hear a WWII/Holocaust-related story that focuses on non-Nazi Germans during that time, for a slightly different perspective."
4,compelling,A compelling stirring story. Strong characters that you really get involved with. Do not be afraid to cryAs you surely will.
5,Book Thief,"Loved this book! I thought it was a powerful account of what words and the ability to read and write well do for society. Things we take for granted, or learn and refine reluctantly. Also a reminder of what humans are capable of and how a movement can get out of control."
5,Much more than I expected,"First, I am a 50-year old retired Marine and I cried several times, or at least my eyes swelled with tears.Second, I only bought the audio version of the book because my 12-year old kept using all of the German swear words and I wanted to using the masculine form when he called me a dirty pig. He was.Third, The story captivated me. I could not help becoming attached to the characters, laughing with them and feeling their pain.Thank you Mr. Zusak for a beautiful story."
5,Really well done,Very interesting story and well written. Captures the reader and hard to put down. Would like to read more by this author.
4,A very good read,"I am partial to books and movies about Nazi Germany and the atrocities of The Holocaust. This is a novel with a focus on children ""coming of age"" in Munich during the early 1940's. The protagonist, Liesel Meminger (aka ""The Book Thief""), although not Jewish, is an ""outsider"" by Nazi standards, evoking Anne Frank's precocious sensibility. The book is ""meant"" for adolescent readers. Although I am well beyond my adolescent years, I found the story compelling. The narrator is ""Death/The Grim Reaper"", and I alternated being fascinated by this perspective on some occasions, but finding it contrived at other times. This led me to eliminate one star from my rating. Nevertheless I am glad my 13 year-old son accidentally left the book in my bedroom. Now I'm trying to convince him to read it!"
5,Too great to put down,"This was simply an awesome book for general reading but also for the depth put into the day-to-day living of an ordinary german in ww2. The narrator was extraordinary chilling and the graphics made we stop in mid-stream. Awesome, awesome"
5,Absolutely Marvelous!,"Not enough words to describe how wonderful this book is! Love, life, death, art, beauty, truth, lies, nobility, cruelty, selflessness, -everything in one book. Very complex ideas but easy to read. Beautiful, lyrical language but brutal honesty. Each character has been fully developed and contributes essential depth to the story. Heart-achingly poignant. Everyone should read this book at least twice and buy it as a gift for good friends. I'm grateful to my friend for recommending it!"
5,The Book Thief,"This is the best novel I have read in ages...No book has made me feel the emotions of Nazi Germany like this. We see a world where children are still trying to be children, even though they are experiencing tragedy, disappointment and loss all around them. It is an uplifting testimony of the human heart, compassion and morality woven into a brilliant story told by the narrator, death. An excellent novel, I highly recommend it!"
5,Teaching Literature,What a wonderful and thoughtful book. I cannot wait until I incorporate this beautifully written piece of literature into my lessons. I believe this book will inspire students as well as illustrate many faucets of writing.
2,Too self-conscious for me to finish,"I'm afraid I'm writing this review without having read the whole book. After reading the first couple chapters I became so impatient with the affected, graceless prose that I left off reading. Tries to be too cute and arty, forgets to show instead of tell."
2,Heavy-Handed Writing,"This was the first book I've read by Zusak, and I found it hard to get through. The problem was the writer's habit of writing down to the reader. He seems to think it's necessary to explain his points, even when they're clearly made. For example, after describing acts of kindness done by one of the story's characters, he tells us, ""She was a good woman."" It appears that he doesn't trust us to draw such conclusions for ourselves. Or maybe he doesn't trust himself to tell a story well.In any case, I found the writing ham-fisted, perhaps appropriate for readers in the 9-13 age group but not for older - or for that matter, more sophisticated - readers."
2,disappointing,"Confusing , disorganized and disappointing. I found this bpook to be difficult to follow.I could not empathize with the main character. A waste of time."
3,German war story,"Though a tale of middle class German life during the WWII, it does not ring true. There are some historical anomalies, i.e., few Germans were unemployed during the war and until the end, few suffered hunger on the scale described. On the whole it is an interesting, t hough not great book."
3,the book thief,My book club reviewed this book and it sparked a lively discussion. Most thought it was well written and a great reminder of all that happened in that era of WWII. Many of us are of the age that we were youngsters during the era and it was most interesting to learn more.
3,Interesting narrative perspective,"I know that this is an immensely popular book and that I will upset some people, but I have to say that I found it to be just okay. I liked the unique perspective of having Death be a first person narrator. That seemed to be the main hook to the story.The adventures that Rudy and Liesel had were entertaining and my favourite part of the plotline. The rest of the story? Meh. It was slow and rambling often without any clear direction."
5,Favorite book of all time,"This book was incredible, I highly recommend it. Out of 5 stars, this receives a 20. I have read countless Holocaust and Nazi-era Germany novels, and this blows every one out of the water."
4,Interesting read,"This book is written from a very interesting perspective. Great character development, and a powerful story. It's one of those books that puts your own life into perspective."
1,"Weird, boring, overdone...","A friend handed me this book and said ""Incredible. This is required reading!"" so of course I assumed it was going to be amazing. I like stories about WWII as well, so I thought I was in for a good read. I struggled to get to page 50, the writing was so dry and the voice of Death was annoying and distracting, not clever or witty like the author aimed for him to be. I figured the book would get better later on, so I continued reading. I got to page 350 and decided that it wasn't going to get better and I put it down. I could not understand how someone enjoyed that writing style, or why someone enjoyed such a boring story...I'd rather read Anne Frank's diary, thank you very much. This book is all hype!"
1,Ridiculously SLOW! Worst book I've read,"This book was so boring and so paced. It is the first book I have started and didn't finish. I managed to get 50 pages from the end and couldn't take another second of this. I hate the way ""Death"" narrates, he is beyond annoying! This book just drags on forever. Honestly, I don't understand the hype. Really, really bad!"
5,Highly recommended,"Having death as narrator was unique. But the book was so well written, dealing with this historic time - that was so sad - with a joy that is not often available. Characters are well developed."
5,Book Thief,"This is noted as a ""small book"" but it is really huge. These individual tales about the Holocaust really personalize the history of that horrible time. It gives voice to what everyday Germans were living through and more importantly how individuals tried to help Jews because they knew it was right regardless of the atmosphere."
5,best book ever,i loved this book so much. it moved me to tears. you will love it. leisel rudy papa max and all the other characters were so real and i never thought someone could write something so touching andmoving. i am so happy i read this book.
5,The Book Thief,"The book, considering it was labeled used, is in remarkable shape. I appreciate being able expand my library with ""used"" books, sold at such fantastic prices."
4,The Bonding Power of Words,"Most wartime stories tell of soldiers. The Book Thief tells of how children, families and individual civilians struggle to survive war. Despite a grim beginning (the death of a six-year-old boy) and the use of Death as a narrator, The Book Thief ultimately focuses less on loss and more on the gift of human connection.It describes ordinary human beings coping with extraordinary times. Some do so with generosity, others with an eye to personal gain. Whether deserving or not, the privations and bombs of war fall on them all. Some survive. Some don't.The lucky ones are those who have managed to steal a piece of each other's hearts."
3,Not my style,I Love books that are sent during the time I wasn't born. I found this book way to confusing and at times boring. I am happy I even finished it at times I felt like the author or the book was getting better but I was wrong.
5,Magic with Words,"The Book Thief was a sad account of World War II as it affected German citizens. The plot was riviting, but that was certainly not the outstanding feature. The way the author described words, ""she carried them on her shoulder,"" was original and artful. I loved the way the children were described. Despite all the horrors of war, they were children, as children the world over, during that time period."
5,Unforgettable book,"Where to begin? I think it should be considered an adult book. Putting it under the young adult section probably prevents it from being more widely read.It is the most unforgettable book I have ever read. I felt actually sucked into it as if I was living the story. I didn't want to let the characters go. Every one of them came alive to me, and I cared about all of them, even the villains (except Hitler, of course). I couldn't put it down and the next day, I had to start reading it over again. A heart wrenching story that shouldn't be missed. I don't think I will ever for get Liesel Meminger, Rudy, Hans, Rosa, and all the rest including the unusual narrator. Give it a try. You won't regret it!"
4,The Book Thief,"It took me a while to get into it and almost put it down. However, when I did finally get past the first 50 or 60 pages, I was glad I stuck with it. It is an excellent story about a young girl growing up in Germany during World War 2 and how the war affected her family and her life. Thought-provoking."
3,This was recommended to me,"in a book forum, it was a good read, but choppy in places. I'm not sure I'll read another book by this author."
2,The book Thief,"It was hard at times to know the right time frames referred to.I,m only about half way thru the book but will definitely finish it.The Book Thief"
5,I'll ponder the beauty and tragedy of this book for quite some time,"Beautifully written, intriguing concept, and the ability to show love and happiness wrapped among human suffering and tragedy. Read and share this book. It is important."
5,"Wonderful story, I laughed, I cried and I fell in love.",This book truly was a great story. Beautiful and dark at times. I would highly recommend this book!
5,Well Worth the Read,"This book was selected by a book club I belong to. It is well-written and an extremely interesting premise. It is so much fun to stumble onto a book where you find yourself wanting to read for hours at a time yet knowing if you do, you will be finished all to soon. I highly recommend this to readers of ""literature""."
5,Book Thief,"A small, simple, breathtaking book. Very powerful and vivid book that despite all of the heartbreak left me with a smile at the end. The memory of love, the notion that the protagonist experienced, brought her happily through life in the end."
4,A great read,"It's like, you know something's bad gonna happen if ""Death"" is narrating but you keep reading anyway. It's like your perception of WWII and Holocaust is one-sided- the Jews and the minorities are the victims and not the rest. This keeps you in prespective that those times were terrible times and it doesn't really matter which side the story is. I'm 27 years old and I have fairly read books in wide range of genre from fantasy novels to mystery to poignant novels and love stories with historical background and I must say that The Book Theif stands on it's own. It's expected the characters' experience would get worse per page but it becomes a mixture of good and bad and that makes it great. In the end, you are happy that Leisel survived and lived a very long life and yet you don't feel victorious ,for the fact that her loss of the people she loved was not justified in any way."
5,"A haunting story, beautiful writing, heartbreaking...","I just finished and I...am...speechless. I cried nonstop the last 50 pages of the book, but at the same time it was beautiful. The language is poignant and the point of view unique. How Death could tell the tale in such a lyrical way that touched me so deeply is beyond me.Markus Zusak writes so beautifully, it's poetic. The characters are real and flawed and the relationships are so touching that I cared very deeply about the characters. The fact that the narrator is Death was hard to swallow at first, but it's unique and Death's thoughts are woven intriguingly through the story.This is a must read.""I am haunted by humans."" -Death"
4,Well Worth Reading,"I wasn't too sure at first how I felt about Death being the narrator. I couldn't get an immediate sense of voice or what I could expect from the book. I pressed on because so many reputable people loved it online.In the end, the story, its events, and its characters moved me to tears. I can't remember if a book has ever made me cry before. I've read several books about children during Nazi Germany, and this book is definitely a fresh approach to the subject.In the interview in the back of the book, Markus Zusak says he wants readers to remember his characters. Not a problem at all. These are characters I'm proud to carry with me. The story is profoundly moving and well-written. I would've liked to see a slightly different take on the ending, but I certainly have no regrets about taking the time to read this. Beautiful."
4,A good read!,"Well written. In spite of my promise to myself that I would avoid WWII themes (too many currently), i couldn't put this one down. Not the very best literature - but a good read."
5,One of THE Greatest Books that I have read,"I was a little skeptical about reading a book from the point of view from death, but it was a very easy read and an astonishing story about a young girl in Germany during World War 2."
5,not just a young adult book,"theoretically a young adult fiction; but i can't see why it's not an amazing book for adults also. set in nazi germany, it's the story of an orphan girl, into a family who hides a jew in their basement. part coming-of-age story, part adoption story, part holocaust history. oh, and it's narrated by death. seriously."
4,Death as Narrator- Why didn't I think of that?,"Read The Book Thief if you love books about the Holocaust, coming of age, purpose-driven living, and death.Flowing with vignettes so real, you are bound to be transported, this book is presented from the perspective of death. Yes, death, who jokes about our human perception of his arrival sporting a sickle. Death as narrator, wonderful! Wish I had thought of it, but I didn't. Read it."
4,The book thief,I like the book but not the style I enjoyed the book from the perspective of death but not the move back and forth in time.
5,"Oh, wow..","This book has the saddest twist ending ever, but it's the most endearing story ever. For real, this is the best book ever."
5,Death as the narrator!,"This story drew me in from page one. Markus Zusak has a wonderful way with words.""I walked in, loosened his soul, and carried it gently away."" ""Somewhere, far down, there was an itch in his heart, but he made a point not to scratch it. He was a afraid of what might come leaking out."" ""Burning words were torn from their sentences.""These are just a few sentences that convey his beautiful imagery in this book. This is a very different perspective on Germany during World War II and the Holocaust. It was great to see the side of Germans that were against Hitler and wanted to protect those that needed it. I felt that Zusak captured Germany during that time; what it was like to be a non-Jewish German, a young adult, poor, watching your world fall apart around you, seeing the cruelty of war and intolerance, and yet trying to make sense of it all. This is a story that needs to be told and it is beautiful, heart-wrenching, sad, and yet hopeful."
5,Outstanding,This book is so creative and well written that I'm shocked it has not won major awards. Young author captures the atmosphere of WWII Germany with memorable characters and plot. Great for young and old. I have never before read a book narrated by Death!
4,Great Story,"This is a good book and a great story. It didn't keep my attention the entire time and as a result I was slightly confused for a bit. But, that's not the books fault. This story opened my eyes to a world I couldn't imagine. I didn't breeze through it, but I'm certainly happy I read it. I would recommend this book to adults and teens. Give it a read."
5,Excellent!!!,"I had a hard time getting past the first few pages, which were a little odd, but the rest of the book is totally worth it! I loved it! Not going to give the story away, but I would highly recommend it. An interesting story in Germany during WWII because the main character is NOT a jew."
5,The Book Thief,"A friend of mine told me I had to read this book. I was not disappointed. It seemed to have a strange start with death being the narrator, but once I got started I couldn't put this book down until I finished it. I read it in two days. It shows the humanity, love, laughter and tears during a terrible time in history. I will certainly look for any other books by this author, and have recommended the book to all of my friends."
3,Hmm...,"...it didn't move me.Before I began reading it, I was curious about how this novel could have accrued so many accolades...and yet also, some really scathing reviews. The book's blurbs were *so* effusive. It seemed like reading it was going to be a real experience for me, a truly transcendent experience.It wasn't. On either count.It's well-written.Its often pithy and almost point-form style makes the subject matter easier to process. (Not that I needed it to be; I'm an adult reading a piece of young adult literature.)And the characters are almost all interesting and well-shaped.But it wasn't a memorable story. I didn't find myself not wanting to put it down. In fact, I found myself in 'dutiful reader' mode.I'm glad that this story was written. I'm glad that so many people have clutched it to their chests. And I'm glad for the author's success.It just didn't do it for me...regardless of its category.(Personal rating: 7/10)"
5,ADD this book to your personal library,"This book is so moving and powerful, anyone who reads it will be profoundly affected by the experience. This book was released in the author's native Australia as an adult book. All ages from 13 and up will be glad they read The Book Thief. Many of the events in the book come from the authors grandmother's first hand knowledge and experience of living in Munich during the early years of WWII. Anyone who loves books will appreciate the book thief's desire to ""steal"" books. I don't advocate stealing this book but you should certainly get your hands on a copy!"
5,Wonderful novel!,"This book is truly great. Extremely interesting perspective, and it grabs you and won't let you go. A tremendous read, highly recommend!"
3,Took a while to get going.,My wife loved it. It took a little time for me to get involved with the story. Very interesting delivery.
4,"Not what I hoped, but a worthwhile read","I read about this book because my mother's group will discuss it at their book club. I decided to read it because my mother was born in Hamburg in 1936. After repeatedly running home to hide in the bomb shelters for air raids, my Mom was finally sent south to live with relatives. To this day she hates peanut butter, thunder and fireworks - and she does not use the word ""hate"". They were actually fed peanut soup because it was nourishing, but, according to my Mom, not the tastiest. I thought this book might give me an insight into the life she led. By the end of the book, I was happy I had read it, but it did not leave me feeling full. I now will research and find the additional books to help me in my journey. I can see why this book is directed toward young readers, but realize it is a harsh reality. And knowing that people actually were so cruel is difficult to digest."
2,Painful Read,"Trying to finish this book can only be compared to a dentist appointment. You feel obligated to show up, but it's not fun for a second. The book wanders through over 500 pages without ever really making up its mind about the central plot. As a result, the reader feels like there is no end in sight.The writing style may be beautiful, but it ultimately was about nothing. I felt no connection to the two dimensional characters. The content is trite and have been done better in the past."
2,Too long,"Not brilliant, not hugely ambitious, too long, boring middle, nice ending. Read to Part 4, then skip to Part 9 and you won' t miss a thing"
3,"Childish writing style was a turnoff for me, but the topic is worth it","I've seen more polished metaphores in undergratuate English compostion classes, and the ""silly"" aspects of an all too human death as the narrator and the ""blurbs"" that interfere with the flow of the story were turnoffs for me. The topic of the behaviors of Germans and German Jews in WWII is worth a book group discussion, though there are much better written fiction and nonfiction books that cover this topic. I would not have read this book if it were not a selection of our book group. For me, it was like trying to read a Dan Brown novel. I can't get past the bad writing enough to appreciate the story."
2,Lackluster,"The underlying story of a book-stealing foster girl harboring a Jew in Nazi Germany was certainly interesting. However, Death's choppy, vague and sometimes nonsensical narration was distracting."
2,The Book Thief,"My daughter and I started reading this together and just couldn't get into it, we didn't like it at all."
2,The Book Thief,Most likely you'll like this book. I'm NOT into sad story or this kind. This one you'll have to make up your on mine. My grandson in college recommend it to me. And He's deep at times. About her life and how she aquired books in war in Germany. Take a chance. He said it's GOOD. Sad story
2,Slow.. Slow.. Really Slow..,"Picked it up cause of the great reviews on Amazon, but was disappointed.It is not a 4.5 star book for me.The narration is interesting but honestly the story takes forever to take off, drags a lot n depresses you by the third of the book.But again, some people dig depressors. :)There are better books to recommend."
3,There Should Have Been More,"I had just gone to bed one night and was settling in when I heard what was clearly my roommate crying. I got up, because I knew it was my roommate, and I was prepared to comfort her through whatever it was that had upset her. I opened her bedroom door and saw that her face was covered in tears, and that she had this book in her hands. ""I'm okay, it's just so sad!"" she said.So of course I had to read this book. I didn't cry, but I can see why she did. This book is quite good and has a sad ending. The only reason I didn't cry was because my favorite character didn't die.... But my roommate's did. And you'll have to read it to find out who is who's."
5,Wonderful!,Everyone needs to read this book! It is written beautifully and takes you on an amazing emotional journey. It is one of my new favorite books!
2,Dull reading,"I would have never bought this book, except we were reading it in book club. Very dull, slow and not work the effort"
1,Boring,"I agree with all the rest of the one star reviews. Because it was chosen as a book for my book club to read, I tried it and after 200 pages or so, decided not to finish it. I thought the writing was aimed for the young adult, unsophisticated readers...about an 8th grade level, and for those of the population who are not very familiar with WW2. I just don't see all the hype...I've read so many novels that are superior and far more interesting. This is a book that someone who likes the Harry Potter series may enjoy...I guess. I like more realistic writing with more depth. I hope our next book club selection is better!"
2,WAY OVER-RATED,The Book Thief (Readers Circle)AN OVER-HYPED BOOK--I THINK THIS IS A PSUEDO INTELLECTUAL ENDEAVOR--IMPOSSIBLE TO GET INTO THIS STORY- THE WRITING IS RATHER POOR- THE AUTHOR TRIES WAAAY TOO HARD- BUT I YHINK I AM IN THE MINORITY BASED ON PREVIOUS REVIEWS
1,"I never review, but this title's rating must come down!","I had really high hopes for this book but it did not come close to delivering them. Boring, slow, extremely weak plot. The multiple stories of Liesels life were very disjointed and did very little to push the story to its ending, which after reading I still don't know what it is. And the foreshadowing ensured that there was not a single surprise to be had. Waste of time!"
1,Don't bother,"Why the large number of positive reviews? Does this mean that the book is yet another one chosen for first one book group and then another? Red flag!!! I found the narration by ""Death"" to be so contrived that I couldn't make it past the few pages. No matter how compelling the actual story might be, this self-counscious, annoying literary device made the book unreadable. Pay attention to the negative reviews, and spare yourself this tedious narrative."
1,"Whine, whine, whine, whine","I made it through about 50 pages. I stopped in the middle of what seemed a never-ending whiny rant by the washerwoman about her clients. A good author would have found a way to capture it all in a sentence or two. I found the same wordiness in the prologue during which the author tried to establish the narrator's MO. An author supposedly wrote a friend ""I don't have time to write you a short letter, so I'm writing you a long letter."" This author should have found the time to write us a short book."
2,Below Average,"I found this book to be incredibly boring, one of the few books that I've stopped reading before the end. The narrative doesn't flow. The prose would appeal to young children perhaps, but the story is meant to be for adults."
2,Teen book,I did not realize this was actually a teen book and was very disappointed in it for a teen as well as myself. Too drawn out.
2,not that bad,"it was definetely a nice read but I expected a bit more. It was easy to read and understand but a bit boring, too. What a pitty. I would rather recommend ""Liverpool Street"" by Anne C. Voorhoeve. That is much better than the book thief and much more authentic, too.Weird character of the protagonist and less authentic. Did not like the description of the characters in general. They seem to be so constructed.I liked the idea of the death collecting the souls but it happened nothing more. Why didn't Zusak make more out of his brilliant ideas?Read ""Liverpool Street"" if you are interested in authentic stuff or ""The book thief"" if you want to read for the sake of reading."
2,Very slow and much too long,A few friends recommended this book and I had read many good reviews so I was looking forward to it. I did not like it and had to push myself to finish. A VERY slow start and the pace never picked up.
5,A story to enlighten and stir readers of all ages,"This book really crept up on me. I read it, I liked it and I wanted to keep going. As the story progressed, I found myself more and more engrossed and more and more attached to the characters. By the end of the book I had a lump in my throat. And although there is soul-crushing sadness, there is a beauty and lightness in the story that is nothing if not uplifting. I highly recommend this book."
5,"The Saddest Endest, The Best Story Telling",* MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS *Liesel Meminger was not used to having much. She lost her mother brother home and much much more. Maybe you aren't a big fan of sad books i wasn't. But I promise this book will find a wsy to inspire you. Another promise. In the end you WILL cry for Liesel Meminger.
4,An Intriguing and Interesting Book,This book sounded interesting at first and thought I had nothing to lose. I ended up really liking it and couldn't put it down. If you like reading stories on the holocust this is a great one.
5,Interesting read!,"Really good book. I loved how it was written from the perspective of ""death"". It's not the way I was anticipating the story to flow when I bought the book, but it worked well. Beautifully written!"
4,Enjoyable read,"Timing is World War II when Jews were being hunted down and rounded up and persecuted. A young girl loses her family, her mother can't take care of her anymore and she goes to live with a couple who secretly take in a Jewish man. Books become a lifeline and a way to connect. I very much enjoyed the storytelling and learned a lot about history, as well.This book made me appreciate the ease with which we acquire books these days. We've much to be thankful for."
3,"Didn't love, but didn't hate either","I didn't love this book, but I didn't hate it either. I just didn't fall in love with like so many others. I did read the entire story and found it interesting enough to finish. I just didn't seem to warrant all the hype from my standpoint. Maybe I just couldn't get into the narration by Death or maybe I just missed the true component of this time in history as told through non-fiction books."
2,"Over-hyped, in-your-face","This book did not live up to the hype. The story was full of cliches and stereotypes, and the narration by Death was so overwrought -- an annoying gimmick that was kept up and stretched out throughout the book. And for a book that is against Nazism, it's surprisingly racist, with a use of blackface that's actually praised as an act of courage."
5,The Book Thief,"Oh, I just loved this book. Again, what a great look into life in Germany during World War II.And the narrator of the book is to intriguing. Great, Great Book!!!"
5,Loved it!,"I didn't really know what to expect with this book... I didn't know much about it other than people I know and some podcasts I've listened to kept recommending it. I finally received it as a hold request from the library, and it was so worth it. I love this book. It's not the happiest of stories in one of the saddest times in recent history, but there are glimmers. I love the point of view from which the story is told, and I love the book thief herself. Max and Rudy will stick with me for a long, long time. I finished it a week ago, and I'm still thinking about it.I do not reread books very often, but this is one of the few that I can see myself re-reading. I hope to recommend this to everyone I know who hasn't read it yet. If you haven't, give it a try."
5,Great read,"I won't give a book report as other reviews give great detail but I will tell you why I give this five stars and why I admire this book. For the first time I wished I had a Kindle because I wanted to highlight what I found within the story to be exquisite, golden nuggets of writing that made me stop, reread, and ponder before I continued with the story. I (and others I encouraged to read) did have a hard time getting through the first few paragraphs, so stick with it. It is a gorgeous piece of writing."
5,A wonderful book,"The Book Thief is a WWII story about a girl who is ripped from her family and placed in a small German town where she begins to form meaningful and often quirky relationships with her new adopted family, friends and neighbors. Yes, the main character (Liesel) steals books, but only ones that have been left for the taking. Once the characters of the small town are set in place, the author brings in Max, the Jewish boy who hides in the basement of Liesel's house. Max brings new purpose to the family who hides him. And although the reader never gets to fully know Max, his presence allows the other characters to grow exponentially. Beautiful relationships are formed within the Nazi horrors of the small town. The author does a tremendous job in showing the power words have in both destroying and building relationships."
5,"Passionate, original, compelling","Bravo to Markus Zusak. The central character of this novel is a young girl, raised by German step-parents, during the period of Nazi Germany. The book brings a rich perspective on what it means to be human, including the power of words and language. So many novels today are empty, pale imitations of what has come before. This one speaks to the human heart. Though it tells of terrible things, it is a work of inspiration and feeling."
4,Refreshingly different,It was a refreshingly new point of view to a very sad time in human history. I definitely enjoyed reading this book.
5,The Book Thief,This novel is very interesting. It gives the reader an idea of life under Adolf Hitler was like. The imagery of death looming is so apparent and so a part of the whole senario.
5,"Beautiful, haunting tale of humanity","This book is beautifully written from start to finish. The characters are vividly painted into your mind, and the tragic background is so bleak but punctuated with sweet, genuine moments that restore your faith in the human spirit. The story is simple, a young girl living in Nazi Germany is delivered to foster parents after her mother can no longer support her. Learning to read and finding books help her endure and see the beauty in the most bleak circumstances. the characters, background and historical context make this book engrossing and affecting through and through. Read this book now!"
5,Awesome,I checked this book out of the library at the suggestion of a friend. I couldn't put it down and when I had finished it I knew that I had to own it so I bought it immediately. It is an amazing story of the Nazis in Germany and how the Germans who did not support the Nazis were treated. It is well-written and gripping.
4,Still trying to make up my mind,"Some books are easily forgotten the minute you finish them. Other books stick indelibly in your mind long after the pages have been turned. The Book Thief is without question in the latter category. I still am not sure how I feel about this book, but I mean that in a positive way, just as I did not know how I felt after reading Diary of a Young Girl or watching Platoon for the first time. Man's inhumanity to man is an eternal theme, but one that always created many mixed and confusing emotions in me.Needless to say, you will not forget this book.Warning: This does deal with some very adult, but important, themes that may disturb very young reader."
4,Heartbreaking,"This is a sad, although hopeful read. I like the concept of a tale narrated by death. I feel as if death is a lot more honest and raw than others would be, and yes, death does have a heart. You can't help but feel bad for him too. After all, he has a job that no one really wants, but yet it must be done.For me, this story lagged a bit in the middle. I feel as if it dragged on and on for awhile before it finally picked up and reached a pace that finally brought on the sad, but thoughtful conclusion to the life of a foster child that lived during Nazi reign in Germany."
5,Book Thief,"This is an extremely well written book. I think the use of ""Death"" as the narator is very clever and well done. I have bought copies of this book to give to friends to read. It is categorized as a ""teen"" book, but enjoyable to adults as well."
4,Very Well Done,"'The Book Thief' is entertaining, thought provoking, and very well written.It is the story of a young girl, Liesel Meminger, living in Nazi Germany during WWII. She has lost her family and is sent to live with a foster family, the Hubermanns.There are numerous subplots within the story, several of which are thought provoking. Hans Hubermann, Liesel's foster father, takes some actions that put him in danger by helping Jews. To avoid spoiling the plot, I will refrain from further details about that.Liesel and her friends are forced to be in the Hitler Youth, but show some disdain and resistance.The NY Times Book Review really oversold this saying it 'can be life changing'. I would say that is an overstatement, but it really is 'brilliant and hugely ambitious' as they also said.This book is very different. It is certainly unique, and it is a worthwhile read."
5,Surreal and Heartbreaking and Unique,"I absolutely loved this novel! With its unique narrator, the story was able to cover so much more than a normal novel. Its characters are so realistic, their emotions surreal. It keeps you hooked the whole way through, despite its incredible sense of foreboding. It is haunting, and a true masterpiece, to really see in depth the pain and moments of happiness occuring in Nazi Germany during world war one. This story will stay with me forever! :)"
5,Death telling its story,"Having death tell its story is a unique perspective that makes this book so addicting and amazing. I wouldn't say grade 9 for an average 9th grader it may be too much I would say 11th grade is when they would be old enough to really appreciate it. I am in my 20s and this book was recommended to me as a vacation read. I sat at the beach all day and read, I was addicted, I could not put it down. It is a smooth read but it touches you do deeply it feels like you are reading an adult novel. This book is worth the time and money. You will never want to put it down and the story will make you reflect on your own life in a way that the book becomes a part of you."
5,Excellent writing!! Love this book.,"This author has a true gift with words and storytelling. I've read many WwII/Holocaust books, but this is the best! The author has created some incredible characters that you can't help but fall in love with. Terrific!"
4,Easy reading and entertaining,You really feel the writer's perspective and the story keeps you interested.This is a relatively fast read for anybody.
4,Worth the Read,I love the style of this author as it grabs my attention. The topic isn't pleasant but it is a different perspective than the typical WWII book. I would definitely recommend this book.
5,One of the best I've read,"With every chapter my interest grew. It is brilliant the way that the story is told and the perspective from which it is told from ( I won't ruin it for you). It may be a little slow at the beginning, but when you soon will not be able to put this book down. So well written! I finished the book missing the characters. This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read."
3,couldn't finish - cd package was stolen - only heard the first CD,"CD set stolen. since i didn't listen to any more than the first CD, i cannot make a review for you. Sorry."
1,It was a chore...,"I think there is a reason why this book is in the Young Adult section. Because it received great reviews, I thought that it would be one of those best sellers would be worth reading. It wasn't. Let's just say that not because something is easy to read, it means that it's necessarily good. Nothing impacted me, the language did not impress me and neither did the story. Nothing really happens in the book, I mean, I think there were like 3 main events and the rest is just kids being kids. And the whole, ""I'm a little girl thirsty for more books"" is just something I didn't buy. I shy away from best sellers because they usually lack quality, although there are exceptions like ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and ""The DaVinci Code"". By the time I got halfway through, all I wanted was to finish it and end my suffering. Oh, and by the way, I'm a 29 yr. old woman using my boyfriend's account to write this review."
1,Seriously?,I can't help but shake my head at some of the previous reviews of what is ultimately an okay-but-not-great book. My family recently finished Pullman's The Golden Compass and Lewis's Narnia. Now these are great books worthy of claims of 10-star ratings. This one? Not really. My kids and I struggled to get through this and it seemed more like work than fun.
1,This is a fantastic read for adults and teens,"I heard about this book on Public Radio and I read it, even though it is written for teens. It kept me glued to the pages with a perspective not often seen. It is written about a young German girl during the war and the narrator is Death. The character Death is as amazing as the young girl Leisel and those around her. His care of the souls he collects and the colors he sees in everything thoughtful and caring. It is a book I could not put down."
2,Good but not great,"Zusak is an amazing writer; flowery, poetic, original. However -- this book could have easily been trimmed by 200 pages. It took forever to get to plot points and the pacing is, well, painfully slow. I couldn't wait to finish it. By far, the book's best part is the last 150 pages where we see Zusak at his best and the book (and the story) finally moves along."
2,Whats all the fuss about?,"I really don't see what all the fuss about this book is about. I must be reading something different to what everyone else is.Did I think it was a good book? Yes but did I think it was the best book as some claim, or life changing as the cover says? NoThere are some great moments in the book, but they don't last long enough or so memorable compared to other moments in books to make it amazing.The main character is beautiful, you feel compassion for her instantly, along with a lot of the characters in the book too. I cant flaw that. Its a book where I nearly liked every character, however the story for me was just a little dull."
5,Amazing Book!,"This book is fascinating- told from death's perspective, you get a good overview of many characters you might not otherwise have in a novel. And the price was definitely reasonable!"
4,Will steal your heart,"I read this book on a six hour plane trip, very touching and real. As for young readers, I would reccomend the child have some understanding of WWII before reading this book-as for those without will be shocked into a dark time of history.I reccomend this book to anyone interested-is a page turner!"
5,Book Club Selection,Incredible book! I could not put it down. It was so uniquely written with so much detail. One of the best books I have read in a long time. Awesome book club selection because a tonne of conversation generated from this book.
4,Stirring,"A stirring account of the spirit of humankind in the face of the hideousness of war. The story is told from the unique perspective of Death who comes to save the souls. The last couple chapters had me in tears-- the deep grief of loss, the stupidity of war, the survival of hope."
5,It Steals Your Thoughts!,"Intriguing, provocative, an engaging! This is a very interesting book that draws the reader in and makes him/her consider the myriad options,"
4,Different... in a good way.,"This was a surprisingly good book. I enjoyed the twist of the narration and the authors writing style. I am usually annoyed by being able to predict what happens in a book, but the author tells the story interesting enough that telling us what is going to happen in the story is part of the enjoyment of the book. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in historical fiction."
4,:D,"The Book Thief is a marvelously written novel. It's narrated by Death, which is an interesting twist to the story. The youthfulness of The Book Thief also contributes to the wider innocence of it. It's set in Germany during World War II, adn focuses on a little girl named Liesel Meminger. She steals books to read after she is robbed of her brother, who dies at the very beginning. She finds a sort of peace in her books. Her mother also left, so she had to enter foster care. A bunch has been taken from her. Zusak is great at metaphors and the writing itself. His writing is mesmerizing. It's wondrous. You can practically feel th emotion dripping from these pages. The sarcasm was also a nice touch. It's very possible to be impressed and overwhelmed by moments in The Book Thief. This book is beautifully written. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes to read-- or even people who don't."
5,Wow!,"I normally like to zoom through a book, flipping and speed reading as much as I can. But I wanted to read every single word of this book. I even went back and re-read several pages and passages.I do not know what you call this style of writing, I'm not sure there is a catagory for it. But whatever it is, I LOVED it.Thanks so much. It's been a long time since I read non-romance and I'm glad I gave it a shot.I also liked having the German people's side of how they suffered too.L.K.Killian"
5,AWESOME !!!,I LOVED this book!!!!! It is in my top three. This author has the ability to paint pictures with his words and I did not want this book to end. This is a book to hang onto or buy an extra to give as a gift. Keep up the excellent work Mr. Zusak !!!
4,I'd do 4.5 if I could,"I decided to start writing reviews since I always read through them before buying a book. This was an interesting and well-written book. I read it a year or so ago, but it still stands out as being creative and engaging."
4,death and pain and the resiliance of the human heart as seen through the eyes of death and a little girl he loves,"death sees life without a filter and surprises us by having a loving heart amidst cruelty and despair, and love."
4,A book that lingers.,"Not too often, but it does happen, one comes across a book that lingers. 'The Book Thief' is one such book. The author's unusual style, both in terms of presentation as well as in use of language and expression, was a pleasure. A must for those who are interested in wartime novels and/or people."
5,best book ever,"I have read hundreds of books but this tale of an orphan girl, her adopted parents, a Jewish fist fighter, death and quite a lot of thievery was by far the greatest. It is engaging, moving and a must read. This book was a pure genius."
5,A MOST EXTRAORDINARY BOOK,"THE BOOK THIEF is found in the Young Adult section of my local bookstores which is a terrible disservice to anyone who wants an extraordinary, unique read. Yes, the main character is a young girl, but the narrator is Death and the story tells of the harrowing, and yet, in some ways, uplifting times in which she lives. There are few books that have made me cry at the conclusion or made me want to continue reading-and this book is lengthy-and wonder more about Liesel Meminger. The writing is such that one can visualize the characters and their world. This is beyond the typical YA novel."
5,Beautifully written,"An incredible story, draws you in immediately. Beautifully written. Deeply moving. A great read for all 14+."
5,Powerful tone and language,"Most amazing novels are simple stories told extremely well. The Book Thief is no different. I, personally, did not care much for I am the Messenger, but Zusak is so much more mature and commanding of the language and artistry with this effort. The images and language expressed by Death leave the reader breathless and rereading many passages. I pray Zusak's next effort is just as powerful and full of literary risks. Outstanding work of literature."
1,Clearly not for adults,"This book must appeal to young adults because it is written in same way text messages are delivered with short choppy sentences, bursts of repetitive information and pictures. How sad that books are now being dumbed down in this way! As an adult, I found the book extremely difficult to get through and the story very contrived. I never identified with or cared for any of the characters and thus felt the book was a huge waste of time. Luckily, due it its lack of real story, I was able to skim the last 400 pages in just under an hour and finished it in time for my book club."
1,Tries Way Too Hard,"This is the sort of artistic dribble that constantly irritates me. Not only does it try so hard to be a novel of import, but the writing leaves so much to be desired. Not worth the time waiting for a download."
1,Garbage,"I usually make it a rule to read AT LEAST 100 pages of a book before deciding if I like it or not. I confess I only made it to page 40. I couldn't stand to waste any more time. There are too many GOOD books out there to invest either time or money in this book. I am AMAZED that a well-established publishing house like Alfred A. Knopf would foist this garbage on the public in the guise of a book. There is no continuous thread of a story. You are left to wonder from page 1, just who it is telling this story. Answer: You really don't want to know. The whole book is bizarre & my best advice is to make a note of the author's name & NEVER buy anything written by him."
2,Poor Condition,"I purchased this book and the condition was misrepresnted. The seller claimed the condition was good, but instead of the book being listed as good, it should have been listed as heavily used., slightly damaged. When I recieved the book, I was horrified to discover that the first four pages were missing, the cover was falling off, there were various stains on the outside of the book and some pages,and there crusted food stains on various pages. The seller of this book ought to be consulted and reprimanded."
3,Okayy..,It was a little long winded for no particular reason...I liked the book but I think a little less detail would have made it more tolerable.
2,No climax...,"This book wasn't for me. I had to read it for school and I found a major problem about it. It had no BIG climax. Let't take New Moon for example(I know, I don't like Twilight much either). It's climax was when Bella had to save Edward. In this book there was nothing big or obvious about that. That was the major turnoff for me. Another problem I found out about this book was that it was REALLY confusing. Usually when I'm confused it's only for the first few pages in the beginning of the book because no one knows much about the book. Well, in this book my confusion lasted for a few CHAPTERS. I was disappointed in this book because I saw all the great reviews, but after I read it I wanted by money back. If you're looking for a deep and thoughtful book, then this wasn't as bad as my review made it. Hopefully this helped you and didn't confuse you guys much.~L.M."
3,"Nicely done, good young-adult selection","Narrated by 'Death' and set in Germany during WWII, this tells the story of a young girl who learns to read - books, her host family, and her community - by stealing books. Nicely done, good young-adult selection."
2,From my POV,"I was hesitant about the price of $9.99, but got it anyways. I opened to the first chapter and it was very confusing. I figured I would push through it and maybe the next chapter would be better. For me,it was very hard to understand. Especially when the boy died, that made no sense whatsoever. His lips were in need of repainting? Why did he put his hand over his mouth? Why did he die? Never told us. I read through part one and didn't finish it. Worst waste of 10 bucks ever."
2,I cannot finish this book,"I just do not get this book, and have not been able to finish it. The characters are boring, I just do not get where they come from or what is their point in the book. It seems... weird. Something is happening and I am really not into what is happening and I do not get why it is happening. It feels pointless to me.Death is funny though. I enojoy reading his/hers comments. What seems to be a great idea for me it is really not delivered.Many people like this book, so there must be some merit to it. To each his own I guess, this one is definitely not for me."
3,The Book Thief,"This was my south Florida's February book club selection. It was met with mixed reviews.Several people felt it was very difficult to read because it moves so frequently from narrator to protagonist. And some folks were uncomfortable with the concept of death everywhere. But overall, it was a worthwhile book, but not the most popular."
4,very well done,"it is not the kind of book i can't stop reading. It took a while to finish. It is a nice story but it was not engaging enough for me. The best of the book is the use of words, sometimes it is really mind blowing. This is why it gets 4 stars."
5,<3,there is only one word to describe this book that comes to mind and it would have to be 'perfect' but even so it does not do it justice. The unique writing style and the way in which the book is written is just perfect and i love a book that makes you look back and see everything you thought you understood with a lot more depth and understanding that you did not think possible. Read this book.
3,Didn't love the writing,I didn't connect with the writing in this book. It was not what I had expected (but I knew nothing of the book prior to opening it up). The story kept me going and I wanted/needed to know what happened to each character.
5,A wonderful and touching story,"For the first few pages I had to get used to the rather quirky writing style of Zusak and almost put the book down. But something pulled at me, probably the fact that it's a young adult book and if a young adult could fall into the story then so could a not-so-young adult. And so I continued reading. As it turned out it is a beautiful, touching, funny, sad and gentle story filled with people who will be loved for all their foibles and strengths and brilliant fortitude. I loved every word of it, even the first few pages which I went back and reread once I got the hang of Zusak. Highly recommended."
5,The Book Thief,One of the best books I have read in a while. Compelling characters. Set in pre WWII Germany and through the wartime. Great read.
4,Captivating,"Those book was so captivating, I could hardly put it down. Gripping, intriguing and moving. I definitely recommend it!! Must read!"
5,One of the best books I have read in quite some time,"This is one of those books that you pick up and you are continuously surprised. The author crafts a great story and uses different aspects and different vantage points to take the reader through the war. The personification and characterization of death was very effective and added so much to the story. I felt as though I knew these characters and we were friends and I was right there along for the ride with them. Really good book in so many ways- characters, plot/story, writing style, this book might not be the best book I have read, but it is the best book I have read in the last year or so."
5,An Amazing Book,"I do not know what combination of gift, skill, work and perseverance go into writing a book like The Book Thief; the product seems like a sort of miraculous expression of reality in a historical narrative of fiction. I know that seems like hyperbole, but that is my reaction to a book that I had thought was a ""teen"" book. Zusak's writing is mature, deep and creative.The Book Thief takes readers to the world of Nazi Germany during WWII and a perspective that I had not seen before. On a poor German Street, families seek to survive poverty, hunger, their own country and a foreign enemy.Narrated from the point of view of Death, the story develops endearing characters facing tragedies with hopefulness. Zusak adeptly creates his world and characters that I think would grip any readers and rend their hearts.The Book Thief shows that even in the midst of man's most cruel ventures exists man's most loving risks and expressions. I recommend this book for any adult readers."
5,The Book Thief - Wow!,"I read the first page or two and had to reread - then I realized it was Death's perspective. Such a good book, funny, sad, heartbreaking - this book evoked all my emotions. Loved it! Haven't read anything this good in a long time!"
5,Great Bookclub Book,"I read this as a bookclub pick and while the beginning feels a little slow it is well worth finishing. To quote a friend ""It makes you feel"".Kindle version - no editing/formating issues"
5,A treasure,"I can't remember the last time a book moved me the way ""The Book Thief"" did. Markus Zusak has a gift for words and I thank him for putting those words together so eloquently in this beautiful story. There are no words to adequately describe how this book made me feel. It will stay with me always."
2,People love it,"People love this, but I can't say that I do. It was eh. Fine. Didn't blow me out of my shoes. I honestly don't get the hype. Different strokes for different folks. :)"
5,A unique book!,"I just finished this beautiful book a few minutes ago, and had to come here and write my first ever review on amazon! This book is honestly the most beautiful book I have ever read - I have no words!I don't know what I can say that others haven't said before me, but I can warmly recommend this book!!"
2,Reader Limitations Ignored,"Sorry, but wasn't what I had hoped for. Type size was too small for comfortable reading, and material lacked clarity and continuity. Type size should have been no smaller than 10-point for this type material. Book review was brief after seeing type size, but failed as an introduction to the service."
5,I use it in my koi pond,"I live high in the Rocky Mountains and I have one of the highest Koi ponds in America at 8,500 feet. Winters are cold here so I have to monitor the water temp 24/7. That way I know if my pond heater is working properly. It's a long winter and there have been failures requiring emergency action.I use this remote temp sensor linked by radio to my Atomic Clock in the family room, which also reads indoor and out door temperature. Instead of using the regular out door sensor, I use this one with the remote probe deep in my Koi pond so even when I can't see the pond for the 4 feet of show (like today), I always know with in one degree what the water temperature is, thus protecting my precious pet Koi (some 22"" long and worth a small fortune)from freezing water. They hibernate all winter and come out every spring like little happy campers."
2,Waste of money,"This remote sensor is kind of a bust. Either it or its underground (or underwater) probe failed after a couple of months, rendering it useless. Although the main thermometer and wireless remote work most of the time (at their own whim, it sometimes seems), this remote unit was a great disappointment."
2,They work but...,.. they are failing after 1-2 years. I have replaced mine 1.5 years ago and now this one is gone too. I will look for something more reliable.
3,Not essential.,"I'm a big Cramps fan, own everything by them, but felt a little cheated when I bought this. The recording quality couldn't be any worse. I'd give the cd itself one star, but I give two stars for the booklet, which is great with many great illustrations."
4,Lessons are great fun and extremely useful,"The DVD is fantastic, most of all because it covers everything, from basics to turns and patterns to try in the dance floor. I am puertorrican and used it as part of a series of salsa lessons in preparation for a formal dance in my university. Other hispanic students used it and thought it was extremely useful for teaching and learning. I highly recommend it. Hoping for Volume II to come out soon."
