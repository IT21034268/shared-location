3,"This book reads well and all, but isn't a complete reference",The book has a lot of useful information for the beginner but does not work a complete reference. Too many things just are not covered. It does not cover Location vs Context-type.
2,Jane Austen boxed bookset,"I bought these for my daughter's birthday and was quite surprised when she told me they were about six inches high, have tissue thin pages and very small print. No description was given for the books and I wouldn't have bought them had I known what they were actually like."
5,Jane Austin book set,Purchased this for our daughter. She is thrilled to read and hold the small books as they were originally published.
5,GORGEOUS!!! Need I say more?,"For those lovers of dear Jane Austen's classics and for those collectors of fine editions this is by far the most beautiful collection a Janeite can possibly own. The pocket size of each novel is very comfy, fits everywhere and they're just too irresistible. They're all hardcover and come in a pretty box featuring Miss Austen's portrait on one side, an index on the other and the top side is actually decorated with fine red satin fabric. Each novel comes illustrated by Hugh Thomson!!! Their pages have golden borders and a ribbon to mark where you stopped reading. It definitely makes a great Christmas present!!!"
1,no good,poor quality. threads inside of cap stripped easy. The cap should be small enough for a slide hammer to work with
4,good nozzle,The nozzle extends so far that your hands don't bump into the bottle. Good for a public restroom. Ugly for home use..
5,This stuff is great,I use a lot of sanitizer as I am all over the place in public and was working as a CNA at one time.This stuff doesn't have any strong scents and leaves my hands feeling very soft.
4,Mound Monkey and Munky Munky,"Chris Offutt's first memoir is a pretty decent read. ""The Same River Twice"" is essentially the story of the years after he left home and hitchhiked across the country. The writing is lyrical and concise and there are quite a few amusing bits to this book (see for example the hilarious exchange between Offutt and a NYC-by-way-of-Jamaica hooker on pages 28-29). This memoir alternates (by chapter) between Offutt's cross country travels and his wife's first pregnancy. The latter portion of the pregnancy stuff is occasionally moving and majority of the book is amusing and well written. Recommended and I strongly suggest interested readers review pages 28-29 for some very useful looooove tips. Batter up!!!!"
4,Entertaining,"This is a very well played and well recorded collection of Verdi's orchestral music. My one caveat is that the tempos are on the slow side. If you like Verdi in the grand style, this shouldn't bother you. My feeling, though, is that there is a slight absence of passion. You will not mistake these performances for Toscanini's or Karajan's. I'm particularly fond of Karajan's 78 rpm recordings of the Traviata Preludes, but Downes is quite effective here, and the string sound of the orchestra is impeccable. The ballet music from The Sicilian Vespers in Downes's hands sounds somewhat like Adolphe Adam, not an entirely unwelcome reference point. I would say that this disc is not likely to disappoint you, but there is more to this music than is presented here."
2,Shoe Cleaner doesn't do the trick on mesh sneakers.,"I have three pairs of New Balance sneakers, all white mesh. I didn't imagine that it would be almost impossible to clean the mesh; I looked online for solutions and tried most of them, including the purchase and use of this product. The only way I finally got some of the dirt out of the mesh is to have used Oxy-something-or-other, Cascade, a non-chlorine bleach, bleach, peroxide -- all together in a mixture -- then using this shoe cleaner, sending the sneakers through a scalding-hot washing machine cycle, and finally putting the shoes outside in the sun to bleach out. This shoe cleaner may be great for cleaning regular shoes, but by itself for SURE won't clean mesh."
5,Nice and sturdy,"I love baking sheets that don't flop and warp! We don't bake extensively but we roast as well as bake and these are up to the job. They are good sizes for our needs, though we use the half sheet a lot more often than the quarter sheet because we have a silicone insert that fits into the half sheet; that makes clean-up so easy.It turned out that we don't really use the covers much so I can't say much about them. They're there and they seem to work, that's all I can say."
5,Great pans,"I was quite impressed by the weight of these pans and the quality of the workmanship. I have not used them yet, but I bake a lot and experience has taught me that cakes and cookies bake best in aluminum. I no longer buy the coated stuff. They just don't last like these do. My only complaint was that the plastic lids that came with them had scratches and fingerprints on them, I assume from packaging."
2,"Pan is top, lid is a flop.","Nordic Ware 4 Piece Bakers Half and Quarter Sheet Combo Pack with LidsThe pan (both) looks great, 2 times 10 min at 450F and not a warp. Looking forward to longevity.The lid looks great, fits in shape, but it does not snap in. Watch out when you move the pan around with the lid on as it may just come off with your food sliding out and you dropping the pan with the lid still in your hands.My brownies pan has a lid that is rather tough to ""un-snap"" from its pan so I was expecting something similar.When you take a closer look at the pan edge (thick and round) and the lid interior snap (thin and flat), you obviously see that design/QA tests were not done thoroughly. Very disappointing.I'll keep the pans and manage w/ the lids, but I'm sorry, this being a pan with a lid review and not the pan alone, rate is below average.Interior dimensions: 16 1/4"" x 11 1/2"" x 1""Interior dimensions: 11 1/2"" x 8 1/4"" x 1"""
5,a great package,"Bought this set for my wife who's been doing a lot more baking since our daughter was born. Cookies, and more!While we haven't had this set that long, the pans seem to be very sturdy, and have held up to much use in a short time. The covers are a great addition, and have been useful to have.We bought a Silpat sheet and a cookie scoop to go with them. The wife was very pleased, and I scored some major brownie points! Oh yeah... and she's made some bronwies in these as well. Yum!I'd most certainly recommend these pans. Great set at a great price."
1,Do NOT put in dishwasher,"My wife put one of these pans in the dishwasher after the first time it was used. It came out with the finish ruined, completely discolored, and is now unusable. We have put other less expensive baking sheets in the dishwasher before and they came out fine. Very disappointed that the pan did not survive a simple wash. Wish I could return it!"
2,good enough but too expensive,"these set are nice esp. with the lid came with it but, as for my needs I don't usually use the lids. I found that if you just need the tray better buy them in the stores...I got another set of two tray (13x18) at Sams club for only 10 dollars, that's $5.00 each!!! Same quality aluminum pans with both 13x18 unlike these that the other tray is smaller which I don't usually use. Like I said, buy these if you think you'll be needing the lids and the smaller tray/pan, theyare good. but if you only after the larger pan, get it somewhere else, it's cheaper!"
5,AMAZING BAKING SHEETS,"My girlfriend has been on a baking binge lately. She couldn't have been more satisfied with these bakers sheets from Nordic Ware. Their sizes are perfect to include a wide variety of baked goods. The plastic covers that come with them are even better! We'll often want to take baked goods with us to parties or to our families houses, and the plastic covers make it simple and easy to transport whatever we have."
5,Nordic Ware 4-piece combo pack,I love the lids. They make it so easy to bake & take. Clean up is a snap & nothing sticks; just a quick wipe with a paper towel! This combo can't be beat!
5,Works great,My husband had looked all over locally for this item with no luck! Finally found it on amazon and he was a happy camper as he needed it for his semi to change the oil filter. He said it works great!
3,Larger and heavier than anticipated.,"Overseas contractor. Purchased to perform my job. Bought these for the affordable price tag, but did not anticipate the large size and weight of the sander. If you are planning on doing a lot of sanding, I would recommend a lighter and more compact product."
4,45 King and Connecticut! What else has to be said?,"These guys were amongst the most popular of the CT rappers. They had a few hip-hop classics, most notably ""The Human Jock Box"" which had the finest human beat-boxing on record, next to Wise from Stetasonic. That had many single then this album dropped. They got played on Yo! Mtv Raps, but then disappeared.Until the ""Third Unheard: CT hip-hop album dropped, I did not know that they were a part of crews back in the start of it all. They were on a major label and got plenty of spins on WBLS, but then they were gone. ""Where is they now?"""
1,Don't waste your time or money!,I purchased the unit for my dad. It would not work with 3 out of seven CF cards. I am returning it and purchasing another IOGear CF reader which works with all my cards.
1,"Hates Lexar, just like the other","This unit is not working correctly with my Lexar 256 CF card and Mac OSX. Lots of corrupted data, and worse, it freezes up an OS that is nearly UNFREEZABLE! My mac stays running for weeks on end, but this little bugger will keep the finder in spinning beachballs. While I can use other apps fine, if I need to access a disk, that app will freeze too.Seems to hate the Lexar cards, which is not exceptable, because Lexar makes the only reliable memory cards on the market at the moment!I will be returning this to Circuit City tomorrow for another product. Shame I didn't read the reviews here first..."
1,Crashes my Win XP and wants to uninstall itself,The few times this garbage worked it seemed fast. After a short while the trouble started on XP and now it crashes the system. Be warned there are some major incompatibilites here and you may be the one to suffer. SanDisk needs to recall this product and return the money they stole from the public!
1,did not perform well as expected,"I bought it basically as a CF reader but I get frustrated because it does not deliver its promised specifications. Yes, it is able to read Sandisk CF but NOT Viking CF. I ended up returning it for refund."
1,"Unreliable Product, Never worked!!!","I bought one for the different types of flash memory cards that I have. The product arrived and I had a heck of time getting to work. After reading some suggestions from the Sandisk website, I was only able to get the memory stick slot to work. the Indicator light never came on for the other slots. So I had it exchanged for a second one. And the same things happened. Very displeased with this product. Because of this experience, I'd give a second thought to ever buy Sandisk's products."
5,Nice Card Reader,"I have had this card reader now for awhile and it works super. I use Windows XP pro. When I first got the reader, I was having trouble when I inserted a Sandisk SD card higher than 128 mb. The card reader would drop out of the system. I tried everything to correct this and it was all to no avail. Finally after talking to Sandisk tech support (which were extremely helpful)They had me go into my Norton Antivirus program and disable the Scan all removeable media for boot viruses everytime it is mounted. After doing this everything works like it is supposed to. If anyone else is having this similar problem, give this a try, it should help."
3,Doesn't Work With My Older Viking 128 MB Cards,"This reader works fine with my newer cards (one Viking 512 MB purchased in Dec. 2002, 2 San Disk Ultra 256 MB purchased in March 2003 and a Canon Card 32 MB included with my Powershot S50, March 2003, all CompactFlash). However I'm not satisfied at all with it's performance regarding my two Viking 128 MB Compact Flash cards, purchased in October 2001. The reader refuses to acknowledge their existance. Tried plugging them in repeatedly, to no avail. This is probably because they are old and are missing something that doesn't allow them to be recognized. Apart from this problem (I'll just have to continue using my S50 to upload pictures from these cards) I'm quite happy."
2,Know yourself,"Unfortunately, the SanDisk reader is very inconstant is it's ability to recognize all forms of cards. I've only been able to get it to read a SanDisk 256mb SD card once. As a matter of fact the only device which does not consistently read the SanDisk 256mb SD card is the SanDisk 6-in-1 reader. Compact Flash Cards seem to be the sweet spot with my reader. Best results are seen with CF cards. When it reader is working the transferring of files is quick. I'm running WinXP Pro and have installed all the updates. Purchase at your own risk."
2,DONOT WASTE MONEY ON IT,"looks and Feel great, read 32M CF card and SD card is ok, but not read the 256M CF card. Try to get another brand now :("
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I got one of these from a supplier other than Amazon. It does not work. It sometimes freezes my Windows 98 SE computer (admittedly a USB 1.1 that this is supposed to be backward compatible for). It does not read the cards properly. I thank the person who suggested disabling NAV, but that didn't work either. ...Recommend against"
1,bad,"I tried 3 type of cards with it, Memstick and Smartmedia works fine. With CF - different story. I have Lexar 16MB and Viking 128MB. This thing can not read both. Moreover, after i insert CF everything else stops working, remove - works again. Tried under W2K and Win98SE.Today went to Staples and picked up another thingy(can not call it ""reader"").Exact same result.IMPORTANT:1. sandisk does not respond to customer email requests.2. rebate is still due after 4 monthThink twice.would not recommend."
4,Works Great - Short USB Cord however,I had no problems installing the product on my Dell Windows XP machine and was able to read from all the media that I have. I was a little dissapointed the USB cord from the unit was short - it's at most 4 feet. I have my machine under and to one side of my desk and the cord just barely stretches to the spot that I would like it. I really like the upright look of the drive; it takes up little space and looks better than the flat horizontal drives.
2,Not my favorite....,"I did not care for this tape. The exercises and activity were a little too unstructured for me. I like to have specific exercises and moves to follow, and at times, they seem to ""wing it"". That may not bother some people, but it made it difficult for me. I like exercises that are easy to follow, and while I did like the premise of the tape, and love Richard Simmons, this tape just did'nt meet my needs."
3,"workout fun, video in poor shape.","The Groovin' In the House video is a lot of fun, it goes by really fast. Unfortunately, the quality of the video I purchased was supposed to be brand new, but there were spots in it that were worn out. It has lines going through it, and you cant see what's happening on the video."
4,Follow the steps and do your own publishing,"This book contains all the steps needed to organize and publish your own book. I used it and have just published my first book. Asnwers questions about copyright, ISBN and Library of Congress numbers. The preparation for printing sections explains signitures and other vital prep info. Do it yourself!"
1,"Poor design, can result in problems","These are of poor design. The ground connection is not carried directly through and that can cause hum and static if the two pieces of equipment are not well grounded to each other by other means. I have done audio engineering for many years. I bought 4 of these and then put them in the trash after testing. The internal attenuators are of ""balanced"" design but are installed in these unbalanced units, this can cause the mentioned problems."
1,these suck,"Ordered these to fix sound clipping coming from Nintendo Wii into Sony TV (Wega KV-30HS420) (input was at too high level)These caused additional distortion even when tested on connections that were already working perfectly. They're in the trash now; not worth the money to send them back. I haven't tried the more expensive Harrison Labs ones. My final solution was to bypass the TV entirely and go directly to the surround sound receiver, which handles the higher level inputs just fine. But... I don't always want to turn on the big receiver :-/ oh well."
1,Stay away!,"I should have listened to the one other review -- I bought two of these and one was dead on arrival. Take your business elsewhere, this part is worthless."
5,"Wonderful, Unusual Candy","My kids, and I, love this candy. The Indian restaurant we go to once a month or so keeps a bowl of it at the host stand, and it's all I can do to keep my kids from filling their pockets and making little pigs of themselves over it. The owner of the Indian restaurant said this was his favorite candy growing up. It's crunchy and tastes like honey and sesame."
4,"Great candy, some have a machined aftertaste...","The Joyva sesame candy are a real treat that takes me back to my childhood. I love these little candies! The pack isn't the most economical price, but it isn't like your average store will carry these candies, so it's certainly a treat to have every once in a while if you enjoy the rich and nutty taste of sesame alongside the sweetness of honey.The packaging is just a giant plastic bag - but they're individually wrapped so it's no big deal. The ""big deal"" is that they occasionally can have a weird, plasticy aftertaste that can sort of ruin the taste on some of the candies. However not all of them have this taste! My feeling is the mass packaging and plastic packaging might be giving it some funky flavor, so I guess it depends on how lucky you are with the packaging."
5,enjoyable candy,great candy with a diffrent taste. im not a big candy person but these are great. they are cute little bars made out of honey and sesame. terrific!! i never seem to have enough around for everyone!!
3,Not as good as other Nathan Heller stories,There was a lot of awkward switching back and forth in time that dragged the story down. I did not finish the book.
4,Fascinating!,"Another Heller thriller! This time, he takes on the famous and yet unsolved murder of the Black Dahlia. He weaves a good tale -- and convincing -- that the mystery is solvable. Gives us reason to think ... what do you think? Read it and solve the mystery for yourself."
4,satire or real,"It is always interesting to read of these books because you don't know what you will find. In the ANGEL you see eliot ness and orson welles with a side attraction on rita hayworth. In the meantime there is a bizarre murder with overtones of blackmail. the hero is funny and is a man you want to meet and get to know. while this writing has a story line and multiple characters, it is clever and perhaps even takes a poke at mankind."
4,great charger and great company,"i just got this last week and tested it out on my ZVW 30GB and it charged a little faster than the creative charger and it's smaller size makes it better for traveling, but it did get a tiny bit warm to the touch, but even my creative charger does that too, so it's not a big deal. but im really immpressed with the company. there was a mistake with a different order and they responded really fast and corrected the problem in a fast, friendly and professional manner. will definately buy from them again. A+++++"
1,Very Bad Game,This game stinks it really bad graphics and its pretty choppy animation DONT WASTE YOR MONEY!!!! Luckily when i bought this game i could take it back the next with getting the rest of the credit back exept for 1$. I'd recomend buying Mario Kart Super Circuit for the gba it's only 50 times better
3,ok...,"Even though it has (...) grapics, no music, and no runing plays (only passing) it is fun because it is football (i would get madden 2002 for gba inseted of this...)"
2,Too buggy to love,"I really wanted to love this game, but Nintendo and Midway dropped the ball on this one. Graphics are bearable, but they could be much better. The game is buggy as hell and sometimes ""cheats"" for the computer. I suggest anyone who hasn't bought this game to back away from it very quickly and go buy Advance Wars instead!"
1,This game sucks!,"I bought this game today with high expectations. I have been playing NFL Blitz 2000 on my 64 for the past year or so, which I enjoyed fully. When I first started playing, I couldn't figure out how to snap, and once I did, I couldn't figure out which person was the quarterback. And once I through it, you can't tell where the ball is. The graffics suck (are about equavilent of Nintendo)."
2,This is not football,"No sound, no running plays and a lot of rush!!! I used to play Blitz 2000 on PS1 and was fun, but this GBA version it's almost out of it. The display is hard to read and the dirty moves happends too fast you can not enjoy them. Go for Madeen you Football lovers, That's football!"
1,as bad as it gets (I hope),This game really lacks in almost everthing the only good part are its okay graphics
2,NFL Blitz for Game Boy Advance,I totally agree with everyone that has bashed this game. I waited eagerly for this to come out cause I like sports games and it reminded me of 10 yard fight for the regular nintendo. It was just pitiful!
1,Can this be any worse? I think not!,"I broke my cardinal rule of game buying with this one and bought it without renting it or reading rave reviews. It was an impulse buy that I regret very much. $40 for an official NFL licenced box art piece. That's about what this amounts to. The game is a joke. It's WAY too easy to win, there are NO interceptions in it. Running plays are almost non-existant. Basicly you just thow the bomb play after play and score at will.The game has bugs that make the screen glitch and as you run down the field your player's legs don't even move.ugh. DOG-O-RAMAAnd to think that I bought it over Advanced Wars wich turned out to be a solid 10 for it's infinet gameplay stratagy.Scott Toland"
1,Complete Waste of Money,"this game has no music it's graphics could probally be generated on an atari 2600, but on an atari they wouldn't be so choppy. I had no clue as to how to play but still managed to score on every possession which I don't think is any fun at all."
1,"This game a awful, AVOID!","This a a half-hearted crappy port or a tired game. The first review (the idiot who gave it 5 stars) is obviously a shill of some sort, the game was not released until September and they reviewed it on August 1st, darn suspisous. Avoid this game a wait for GBA Madden, it looks rather promising."
3,nice plug but small area to connect wires,THe marine grade plug is nice and locks firmly into the associated marine grade socket but the amount of room inside the plug to connect wires was minimal and was diffucult to attach 14 gauge wire to the screw terminals inside the body. Not impossible however.
3,"Good product, could be better","good Product, but difficult to wire. small screws inside and not enough space for wires. I had to fully disassemble in order to get the wires in."
3,Very Difficult to Wire,I purchased this small item to plug my battery charger into my ATV as the battery is extremely hard to get access to. Especially in 20 weather. I found it extremely difficult to wire. Several very tiny screws and not much room inside the plug. Had to seek out help to get it wired & by that time I lost one of the tiny screws. After that I found it hard to use as the big clips on my charger were difficult to get on the pigtail I wired in.Solved the whole problem with a Deltran battery tender from Amazon!
4,Psychology In It's Purest Form,"In reading this novel entitled The Essential World of Psychology, I was pleased to find such a rich written work in its particular area of study. The author, Samuel E. Wood, has done an extraordinary job in portraying the fundamental elements of psychological study. He uses his knowledge of the field to demonstrate a true understanding and an effective teaching method to be taught to beginners and professionals alike. He covers definitional psychology and psychology on a personal level to create the perfect blend of teaching material. I was pleased to have read this book, specifically because it was used as the guidelines for my psychology class at the university I attend. This book is undoubtedly more than appropriate to be used to teach all college-level psychology courses."
2,I paid the new price for a used book!,"I ordered a new book from this seller, it came and I inquired as to why the receipt I received was for a used book, I got a reply stating that this was a typo. Once I began using the book however, I saw highlighter and writing in it: not excessive, but it was there. My problem is that you can't advertise a used book as new, 'like' new isn't new!! I am especially upset that I paid the price of a new book when even the receipt said it was used and should have been about $30 less expensive!"
5,Got exactly what I needed!,Thanks a bunch! I got this book for less than a dollar when the third edition would have cost me over $100. It's the same book but the page numbering is a little different than the latter edition. I currently have a A in psych. Thanks again. Quick delivery.
1,horrible seller,"I looked this book up by its name, and when it showed me the results I bought the book that you see pictured. When I got the book it was the wrong book. The book I got was supposed to be the third edition what I got was the second edition of the book so now I have an outdated book. When I tried to contact the seller they told me they list by isbn numbers and it does not matter what the picture or the text said. I was very dissapointed and I will never buy from this seller again!"
3,Good but did not come with reference guide,"The book was in great condition and at a great price but it didnt come with the reference guide that it comes with new. other than that, it was a good buy."
1,Never recieved the book,I ordered the book for school and wasnt informed untill i had been in school for a month that my book was lost and i wasnt getting it. It would have been nice for them to attempt to overnight me a new one since i did pay for it and expect to get it on time. Instead the credited it back to the card. Thanks alot...not.
1,Not happy!,"First, the seller didn't bother to mention that the book was revised for a specific school. Second they said that the quality was good with only a few highlight markings in the book... the book was a mess. The cover was torn and had crud all over it and the pages were ripped. I paid $50 and it wasn't even worth $10. The only good thing I have to say is that the seller got the book to me quickly."
1,Horrible shipping,"The shipping was awful. By the time I got my book, both ends of my book were uncovered, the pages were bent, and it looked like water had spilled all over them.This person is not worth buying from because they will ruin your book before you get it."
3,slow shipping,"I did not get the book between the given dates, and I already started class before i recieved it. I did appreciate the over-night shipping though. plus the highlighting is really going to help me throughout the class. so thank you."
5,good,"although the delivery range was 9th to 24th, i got the book on the 9th. it saved me a lot of points on my psychology course and the book came with all the features and defects, just as the seller indicated. these are the little stuffs that increase your trust both for amazon, and the seller."
5,THE BIBLE for CAGD,"I found this book to be extremely helpful in grasping the fundamentals of CAGD. The author's style is very informal and engaging (yes, despite the very 'techie' nature of the subject). The very liberally distributed illustrations give a good idea about 'whats-actually-going-on'? In all, a very highly recommended book, even if you are remotely interested in CAGD."
4,Missed this show,Was recommended on Amazon and it brought back memories so I picked it up. Yet another show I liked that didnt last.
5,Hilarious,"The best TV series in a long long time. Great comedy, vey original. Too bad it didnt get the attention it deserved during the first season. It is now back on TV again with a new second series, cant wait to pick that up as well when it hits DVD."
4,"Very intersting, but ...","Well, you'd never buy this for Stephen Songheim's singing voice! This probably should be the first volume of the series, since it has reviews of his earlier work, but the songs here are very obscure indeed. Almost all of them are student works, or works written for friends etc. They are really interesting to hear especially as a historical curiosity, (although I don't think I will be playing the CD again without skipping the cut ""10 years old"" which is basically just annoying).I found that after a few hearings the cd really grows on you. It is not surprising however that these musicals in general were never produced, if these were the only performances heard by backers etc.P.S. classics should consider having professional performing musicians perform the never before recorded songs to get a better idea of their merit."
2,can we sit still for just a few seconds?,"I really wanted to like this video. But I didn't make it past the first 20 minutes or so. The editor/producers, whomever must have been wired on caffeine or some other drug because so many images / video clips are flashed on the screen in quick succession it hardly gave me time to think about what they were saying. Apart from giving me a headache as I tried to think about watching the rest in hyperspeed.Not information overload - IMAGE & VIDEO CLIP OVERLOAD. I've seen hundreds of documentaries in my life and many NatGeo docs. The idea for this is great, but the execution / presentation is lacking. Perhaps if I feel really ""hyper"" someday I'll try watching the rest of it. Or maybe it works for a generation easily bored that needs a ""tech fix"" every second via facebook, blackberry, twitter, etc..."
3,"Beautiful Songs, Dissapointing Arrangements","I bought this CD the day it came out- I am a die-hard fan and I couldn't wait to have the chance to own the karaoke CD. I think the music is awesome, but the arrangements and actual recordings of most tracks are sort of dissapointing. If you are a big fan, there is no doubt you will want to own this disc, but if you are just wanting one or two songs, skip it."
3,A Hollywood Point of View,"My personal opinion was that this book was written for people who wanted to know what it was like for Robin Williams in Hollywood. I feel the author does too many take offs on other actors and actresses he names in the book and also on movies and TV shows mentioned. I wished for a true insight into the life of Robin, what kind of person he is and what kind of childhood he experienced. In the preface or early it is stated that Robin's lawyer is not in support of this author writing this book and that lawsuits will follow if needed, so this leads me to believe there is not a lot of substantial facts for the basis. i am enjoying gleaning what I can."
4,Very effectively dispels rumors and other untrues.,"I found this book to be a very interesting and enlightening account of the events that have made Robin Williams the man he is today - the funniest man in the world. Mr. Dougan goes to great lengths to dispel the rumors and other untrues so often associated with the comedian and the actor. However, he does not sugar coat the difficulties (both professional and personal) that Robin Williams has encountered and overcome during his career. The book does drag in a few places where Mr. Dougan provides a somewhat lenghtly background into the lives of people remotely associated with Robin. To me, this information had little to do with the subject at hand. But I still highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about the life (good and bad) of Robin Williams."
3,Robin Williams,"I have always thought that Robin Williams has always been one of the funniest people to ever walk the face of the planet. My dad told me a little about his childhood and I found it to be interesting. Reason why I purchased this book was that I was curious about his life and wanted to learn more. Some of the stories were fascinating. The downfall of this book was that there were not enough stories. I wish the authour would have focused more on the stories about him, then of the other celebs mentioned in the book. I was not interested in hearing about what every movie he did was about. Nor did I care to read about Pam Dawbers bio. If I would have, i would have bought her book. Overall the book, was fairly good. I would reccommend this book to anyone."
2,"""Something about Robin Williams""","or ""Robin Williams - who is he?"" - these would be more correct titles for the book. Since the book tells us something about Robin Williams. And does not answer the question, on who he really is. Despite its rather promising beginning, with the clues to Williams' character being searched through his childhood and a general atmosphere of turbulent 60s, the book does not go far in developing its few ideas. It looks like the author is sinking in unnecessary details of TV and movie production process, which have little to do with Robin Williams as a person and an actor. I hope that one of my favorite actors will come up with his own autobiography, and the book's title ""Robin Williams"" will be trully justified."
1,What do you expect from an unauthorized biography?,"If you want to read a two hundred fifty page tabloid, then look no further. Andy Dougan's choice of words, for the presintation of Robin's life, contains too many of his personal opinions and feelings. If I wanted to read about someone's feelings, then I would wait for Robin to write an autobiography. Since the book has such an informal tone the ""facts"" about Robin's life are easily questioned. This book will be recorded as the longest tabloid article in history."
5,Another Cute Little Golden Book!,"Our daughter who is almost 15 mos. old loves animals and looking at pictures of animals. Once we gave her this adorable kid-sized book, we couldn't pry it out of her fingers! She already has the chunky, heart-shaped book, 'I Love Kitties!' and now enjoys reading about puppies. She loves looking at the pictures of real puppies which, like the kittens, brings about smiles and giggles. This book shows puppies in all sorts of funny situations and is outlined by a cute story throughout. 'I Love Puppies!' is an easy read and the pictures are colorful and kid-friendly--plus it shows Barbie on a few of the pages as well. We are very happy with our purchase."
3,Rambling and unsatisfying,"The Bottom Line:Like the recent Entre Le Murs (The Class), Up the Down Staircase eschews the traditional mold of the new-teacher-inspires-students story in favor of a series of more relaxed and unplotted vignettes about a school year; while this method may have merit, in the case of Up the Down Staircase it leads to an unfocused and rambling movie that doesn't have story as much as storylines and doesn't conclude as much as end.2.5/4"
5,Brilliant and Inspired,"This book is so good, you feel like eating the pages as you read through the recipes! Read it and feel your feet running to the kitchen to try some of the brilliant recipes presented here. You just can't help yourself. I predict this will be the 1999 Cookbook of the Year. I base this on three things: taste, taste and taste. And, of course, the awe-inspiring suggestions for culinary presentation. I recommend every chef buy and USE this book, no matter where they are cooking. Restaurants, cruise ships, caterers, culinary schools, hospitals, nursing homes, bed & breakfasts...buy this book NOW. This book is also a plus to any serious home cook. The inspired recipes are suitable to serve 10, but can be easily scaled down to serve fewer people. The menu suggestions for holidays and special occasions are fantastic. Don't waste any time ordering this incredible vegan cookbook, which promises to kick off the new millenium right!"
3,Vegan not vegetarian,"I was disappointed only in that this was a vegan cookbook and not vegetarian as the title implies. There are some good recipes, but not enough to hold my interest. I sent it back."
1,UNLISTENABLE! Where's The Surf Guitar?!!!,"First, this is NOTHING like Black Aria 1. Not even close. What this sounds like is nothing more than chants ans moans for some satanic ritual. You can't even tap your foot to this garbage!!! There'no real songs here to speak of...just chants and keyboards and moaning.For those Danzig fans out there thinking about buying this, DON'T. You'll listen to it once, then never again. This I promise you.AND, to top it all off, there's not a single note of surf guitar ANYWHERE on this album!AVOID!!!"
1,What the???!!!!!,"I am so upset. Black Aria was cool, so I thought this would be a good follow up, but was I wrong! Basically anyone could have made this crap. Totally uninspired and boring. Repetitive melodies that a 9 year old can hum. I cant believe he is charging full price for this! Dont waste your money, stick with the first one."
1,Missed opportunity,"I'm a long term fan of everything Glenn has ever done, particularly Black Aria. I was stunned on the first listen through but thought I should keep it ticking over in the MP3 player for a couple of weeks before I passed final judgment. Black Aria is a complex and powerful album but I just can't get into version II. All I can liken it to is the sound track from one of the eighties ""Sinbad"" movies. I hope it grows on me."
2,the only thing good about this is that it has been done,sucks but its danzigand i love himoh wellkevin.
1,"Black Aria 1 was better, this is too dark,creepy even for danzig and the cover I dont like.","Yet why am I complaining if I am familiar with Danzig? It can't touch Black Aria 1 which is dark but come on!? This is a foray into Classical Music,But really Dark stuff. Stay away from Black aria 2,My apologies to Danzig who Still Rocks."
3,Okay for the beginner,Beginners may find value in this but anyone with more than a few months experience won't. I really didn't find anything useful. I give 3 stars because it's not a complete loss. The book does have a lot of dead weight though.
2,Not what I thought it would be,"Truthfully this book doesn't really offer that much. I've found it to be fairly useless. Everytime I go to look something up in this book I have to hunt for it. Eventually I give up and get one of my other books. As a beginner book this may be adequate for someone completely new to IIS but for anyone else its not worth the money.The book has no focus and more than half of the book is filler. Hey, if you really want to learn HTML and the other stuff this book talks about to pad page count you'll find that the discussions are extremely lacking. You'll need other books and those books will cover the topics much better than this one ever will. I say don't bother with this one."
3,"Starts OK, ends weak",I had already installed IIS 5.0 but really did not know what I was doing. The first 1/3 of this book was somewhat useful but I got absolutly nothing from the last 50%. He went from pictures and diagrams to nothing but theory on topics that 99% of the people are not going to be using if they bought this (beginners) guide. I can't see myself using this book more than a week at most. I would look somewhere else if I was you.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"How did this book get such a high rating? The information that is covered, is done in such a shallow way that it barely passes as a short-hand outline of IIS. This book is a downright travesty, If this book is your only resource on IIS then you are in a world of hurt. And to all of those people who thought this book was packed with information, I feel so sorry for your employer - if your still employed."
1,You've got to be kidding (or how I got suckered by high scor,"I am horribly disappointed in this book. I bought it because of it's high score. It covers a multitude of topics at a very shallow level and most of the topics it covers I don't even think belong in a book on IIS. Some of it's information is plain wrong too, for example the coverage of authentication. It's coverage of important IIS issues like creating virtual directories for web sites is non-existent. It's where it should be strongest - configuring web sites and servers - that it is weakest. If I could give this 0 stars I would to hopefully prevent anyone else from making the mistake I did."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I bought these aliens for my son, he watched it grow and in about 2 months he was bored with it. We had to keep giving it water and he was never able to play with it, take it out of the tube or touch it. It was the biggest waste of money ever."
3,"Good Car, but assembly is terrible!","We purchased this car for my 15 month granddaughter. To assemble the car, there are 6 screws that connect the dashboard with the body of the car. I think they are supposed to be self threading, but they are not. We struggled for 20 minutes trying to install the screws before we gave up and bought screws at the hardware store. Even if we had been able to get them in, they would have been too long! Little Tikes has serious assembly problems, and since this is not the first Little Tikes toy that we have had these types of problems with, we will not purchase a little tike toy again!"
3,Fun Toy But Assembly is a KILLER,"I bought the cozy coupe for our 22 month old daughter since it is literally a right of passage for all toddlers.She absolutely loves the car. She gets in. She gets out. Repeat. Very cute...BUT,The assembly was ridiculous. Nothing ""snapped"" in place like it so easily ""snapped"" in on the directions video. We almost broke the axle trying to get the roof pillars attached. Parts were not lableled. The different sized screws were a guessing game. The eyes had to be beaten to oblivion in order to ""snap"" in place. My husband is extremely handy and can take anything apart or together, so it was not for a lack of skill. I can only chalk it up to parts that were poorly made and did not fit together. We had to modify parts of the assembly, but finally, the crazy coupe was in tact. Our nerves were shot, though."
4,Grand Daughter loves getting In & Out,"My Grand Daughter loves to ride in her push car. She spends the first 30 minutes, climbing in and out of the car. But when we are ready to walk, she sits back and enjoys the ride. The bad thing about the door lock, is when you tighten the lock, the slide part is to hard to open, and if you loosen it where you can open it, the lock and screw falls off, after the door opens a few times. this needs to be modified!"
2,NOT TOO HAPPY WITH IT,"The leather feels like cardboard. Maybe it will soften with more use. Also, what the picture doesn't show is that the inside of this is HOT PINK. There's also HOT PINK stitching on the outside. I wasn't happy with this purchase but it wasn't worth the trouble and expense to return it."
4,Great resource on Schizophrenia,"I work as a therapist in residential treatment for adolescent boys. Sometimes we treat teenagers with Schizophrenia. This book is clear and concise and arranged in topic areas, dispelling many misunderstandings about the disease.My only caution is that there is a preface by a parent of a schizophrenic son. It is clear in its information and touching. However, the young man in question did commit suicide, which is a real and obvious risk with Shizophrenia. However, if you are passing this book on as a resource, I think it is best to have a discussion about this reality and use it with families who are ready to accept this reality and benefit from all the information included in the book."
1,"BAD product, LOUSY customer service.","I bought this item from Amazon in February 2007.After 2 or 3 months, I started noticing silver sprinkledin my ice. I finally put 2 & 2 together and figuredit had to do with the ""chrome' wearing off the crusher.I sent them an e-mail on July 3rd & got a nice response.I thought I would get a replacement from them but sincethat initial response I've e-mailed them 3 times & beenmet with TOTAL SILENCE.Don't bother with this company."
4,Retro Crusher.,My Grandparents had an ice crusher that looked like a torpedo and hung on the wall. I was hoping to find one like that... BUT this works just fine...
4,Retro Ice Crusher,"Looked for a hand cranked ice crusher since my ""real"" antique one finally bite the dust. Should have looked on Amazon first but didn't. Found one and bought it, love it but felt it was a little over priced for what it is."
4,Substance: Excellent. Form: Not as advertised.,"The scholarship is excellent, well organized and thorough, although the selection of descendants seems somewhat arbitrary. One wonders how they were selected. The appearance of the book, however, is not as described or pictured. The ad has a handsome black or navy blue book. The one that arrived was not."
1,Airy-Fairy -----I became naseaus,"This is the kind of CD that makes people laugh at new age music,,, this actually made me feel physically ill"
4,Nice Pan,"I have had my new pan for about a month. It has performed well and I have no regrets on the purchase. I have tried to keep the heat no higher than medium so thus far the pan has not warped. It cleans up very easily. I would recommend it , especially at that price point."
3,Fragile,Its a wonderful pan but very fragile I accidently dropped mine on the floor and it bent all out of shpae
1,Enhanced!,"Note that this box set is Enhanced with music! I prefer nature sounds only, so these cd's were disappointing."
5,Like The Godfather PartII,"was/am a huge fan of ""Baseball Letters"", so I had to get this one when I heard it came out. It's interesting because I almost enjoy reading ""Baseball Letters"" three years after it came out. So many players who wrote swirsky have died. It's like he did a documentary in book form. I find ""Every Pitcher"", his new 'documentary' to be like the movie The Godfather Part II--a fabulous follow-up, even richer in certain respects. Steve Carlton's explanation of why he didn't speak to the media is fascinating--i never knew why. also, the letters from multibillionaire warren buffett--he pitches for his company team-- and peanut character Charlie Brown are very cool--it's among the things that make this book and his first one different."
4,so decent,I just want to comment on Hoyt Axton's song Boney Fingers. The main thing is being broke because we spend our money:If I try to save it pretty woman come and take it.This song has been a favorite for so long that I realize how much American society has been making people pay for desires they already lost. Running up a big tab has been impressive for people who don't stop owing when a clique snap puts a restraining order in place of basic relationships.
3,Missing Tunes,"I was exicited to find this on CD. I haven't heard it in years. However, when it arrived I was disappointed to find that two songs had been cut to fit to one CD. I'd rather have two with more music than one with less."
5,Great efficient workout,"This is the second Mindy Mylrea spin DVD I have purchased (Tricycle being the first). Both DVDs are good. I really like the Short & Sweet and I feel like I get a good workout using any of the three options she gives. My favorite is the tabata but all three are good workouts as long as you push yourself to put in the effort it requires to do high intensity shorter workouts. I don't find the music on any workout DVD all that great so I don't really put much judgement into that aspect. However, the music to Short and Sweet workouts is not bad. The music volume is louder during high intensity sections and then quieter during recovery times at which point Mindy talks a bit more. I would definitely recommend this DVD."
3,Its OK,"Maybe it's just me, but I prefer the style of bike training dvd where you see the open road out in front of you, like you're actually riding. I am new to spinning so I bought this one to use, but after a few minutes of viewing it, it was apparent to me that it wasn't my thing. Also, I am just a little put off by her cleaveage showing. I am a woman and all, but it's just kind of annoying and distracting. I don't know. Maybe it's just me again. She seems like a very experienced and knowledgable instructor, but it's just not for me.I'll probably be selling this dvd on Ebay soon."
2,Workout just ok,"The idea of a short spin video is great but this video has a lot to be desired. I do agree that some of the workouts are somewhat intense, but this is overshadowed by Mindy's constant chatter. I have been going to spin classes regularly for over 5 years and whenever i've encountered spin instructors who talk this much.... they're never employed for long periods of time at the gym. Overall if you want a good 20 min workout, this is a good buy, but make sure your ipod is charged with good music and make sure you mute this spin video."
3,Great cards But...,"I bought several of Dark Portal boxes and like any other set and has great art work. But i do have a complaint about the earlier sets now. Their a great price here where they should be which would come to over a $1.00 a pack.I bought 2 boxes this time and not one <1> sticking loot card and this also happen to me with Azeroth set too. Now i can see why Upper Deck loss the the rights if that is one of the issues. I have collected a lot of these cards and I have got one loot card from all other sets except this, What gives. Not even Booster packs and Wal-mart, Target or any other place.So if your a collector and don't mind not having loot cards. This is a great set. But if that is what your buying these cards for, Buyer beware."
4,pretty good,I have enjoyed all the books in this series. The characters are very engaging and the story lines are complex. I am looking forward to the final book.
4,Not Free SF Reader,"It is not as often that you get drunken Italian style swordmasters running around in your standard fantasy trilogy, but here you have one.A princess with a magic destiny, scary witch nuns, and an undead would be king that wants to marry someone still alive.A nasty church, a composer, and looming war."
5,"Excellent, Non-Tolkien High Fantasy","In ""The Charnel Prince"" Greg Keyes continues the story of a world in which ancient horrors are awakening. Though it's a bit confusing to keep switching between different storylines following the various characters, by the end of this book there's a ""confluence"" that pulls them together and sets everything up for the next and final volume of the trilogy.Keyes managed to do well something that few accomplish. He has created a rich, believable, readable world of high fantasy that doesn't merely mimic J.R.R. Tolkien's work."
4,Fantastic Follow-up,"This book was a more enjoyable read than Briar King was. The characters took a little more shape and started to get some direction, and actually reached a destination(for a bit anyway). I do not like reviews to be too lengthy, but if you liked the first book you will like this one even better. Keyes seemed a bit more comfortable with the writing in this one, it did not feel so choppy when you were reading it. So, enjoy!"
4,typhoon wok 14 inch,"I have owned several non-stick woks. This was my first carbon steel purchase. It seems like a great solid wok, however, I had a hard time getting the handle on and when I got it on, it still slightly wiggles. Wok is nicely roomy and works well otherwise."
5,Nice wok,"I really love this wok, having been stuck with a pathetic little 9-inch wok for tooooo long. This one has nice surface area and the handles are great, they did not get hot. We seasoned it really well and used it at high temperature so we had no sticking issues."
1,"Decent wok, bad coating","The wok is OK, however the ""lacquer"" coating is impossible to get off...I followed the instructions to the letter...it just won't come off, I practically managed to bake it in. In desperation I started to sand it...and yes that will take the lacquer off but only after over one hour of sanding. And the lacquer is not odorless or tasteless as they claim in their pamphlet. I don't know how Typhoon can ship a product with such an obvious flaw; maybe someone changed the formulation of the protective lacquer without thinking that it should be easy to remove... I should have returned it to Amazon but it looked really bad after my failed attempts at removing the lacquer; plus, it isn't Amazon's fault. I really hope Typhoon reads this and fixes this problem."
1,Unacceptable lacquer problem,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. I wish I had read these reviews before making a purchase. I followed lacquer removal procedure to the letter but there is no way of telling whether it has been removed. I assumed that it had an invisible coating that I had removed with the oil during cleaning. It worked well as a wok the first (and only) time I used it. But even with wooden implements, chips of lacquer came off into the food. (Very crunchy but no thanks!) I don't understand how this comes out with a 4.5 Amazon rating. Perhaps there are different product lines, with some woks having easy to remove lacquer."
2,Scratches Easily,"I am not that happy with this wok; I only use wooden spoons and then a platic one to scoop out the food, and it developed severe scratches quickly, including some major gashes. I had to return the first one because it came with rust, and then this problem. I'll use it for a while, but I will probably buy a new one. Disappointed although it looked good to start."
1,You get what you pay for!!,"I suppose I was overly enthusiastic to have found this wok for less than $20! Everything was fine with the order, the shipping, the packaging, except for the wok itself. As other reviewers have stated, I followed the instructions to prepare the wok for usage to the letter, only to be left with smoke in my kitchen, and a burned wok! I tried to use it, and everything stuck to the bottom of the wok. I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the item, and now realize that in order to get a decent wok, I'm going to have to spend more than twenty bucks!"
3,Wok lacquer coating,"Somehow we missed the instructions for removing the lacquer coating, didn't even know it was there. We stir fried and the wok turned brown (still didn't know there was a coating). After soaking the wok in a closed trash bag with ammonia in it, the lacquer finish came of pretty easily. We're hoping the next time we cook, we will be happy with its performance and ability to be cleaned. Well-built."
1,Watch Out for this one. Does not Survive a few Hand Washes,"After a few washes, both handles of the WOK deteriorated rapidly and fell off. I recommend staying far away from this product."
1,Why?,"I remember searching for this group called the dust brothers and soon finding out about the two groups and legal problems. I remember buying Exit Planet Dust and Dig Your Own Hole and all the singles i could get.I like the new album. Not as much...but I like it.This is club music. This single is very wrong. If you want live tracks see the show.]Oh wait, okay, if you like club music and the chemical brother (errr) woo, get this now, TODAY!"
5,Lou's on First,"I really enjoyed this book, and I am passing it off to my wife, for her enjoyment. What a wonderful man Lou Costello was."
5,Related to writer of this book,Purchased this book prior to leaving for my son's wedding in Northern California. Chris and I were born the same year and have never met. I had no idea that she had written a book. Loved the book.
5,received faster than expected,"I found out from a local bookstore that this particular edition of Lou Costello's life was out of print and that their supplier unable to procure. The bookstore reminded me to check with Amazon and there it was. You had one copy which I quickly scooped up. Delivery was even a day earlier than stated. Very pleased as always with Amazon website, products and delivery"
4,Gift For My Mom - Loved It,A book about 1 half the comedy duo Abbott and Costello! Written by one of the kids of Lous. Great cover cool book. Bought it for my mom as a xmas gift. She loved it.
1,WORST PURCHASE!!,"I was very disappointed with this book, not only did it arrive late, it was scribbled all over and as it is a language for beginners book, all the answers were written in ink, (including wrong ones).I know it was advertised as ""used"" but the state in which it was is contemptible and not any good for the purpose that it is supposed to serve."
4,Good book for loach lovers,"This is a nice book to have if you are interested in loaches. It goes into some pretty nice detail on many species, although it is an older book so beware, the names of some of the fishes have changed since the time of the book's publication. It is written by Braz Walker, an aquarist who has written on many other occasions about aquarium fishes. The section on sharks (a type of carp-like fish; not in any way related to the infamous marine sharks) is very small in comparison. If you like loaches, try purchasing this book used somewhere."
4,Very Interesting,"The German/Hitler theory is a bit much to swallow. Sounds to me like german sour grapes after the war. So maybe FDR was assasinated but I don't think there's enough evidence to point to the who/why. German spy rings in the US during the war, Eleanor's bisexuality...for a short book it gave me alot to ponder. The name Albert Kraft sounds like an alias. There was no mention of FDR being a freemason?"
4,"Lies, cover ups and much less...","I purchased this title for the section on the Japanese atomic bomb discussed in the Robert Wilcox book ""Japan's Secret War."" However, the major portion of Hanson's book deals with the possible assassination of FDR by a Nazi agent. Not to spoil the story, folks, but that account certainly seems plausible, but not proveable. Of special interest was accounts of Nazi sabotage within the continental U.S., a subject not discussed in high school history. It was perfectly natural for the government to blame the Port Chicago disaster on African Americans, but not as likely as Hanson's other theories. Given the U.S. government's ability to obfuscate and delete facts, the reader is left wondering is Hanson is not right on track. (This would have gotten a 5 star, if only there were some way to prove the allegations.)"
3,Not an Evolutionary History,"This is not an historical walk-through of evolutionary development. Most of the time is spent on how evolution continues to funtion today. There are some major overlaps: first a segment on how the AIDS virus is constantly changing, then an entire hour on how contagious viruses in Russian are mutating. Some fasinating stuff, but not an overview on how evolution created all the creatures we have today."
4,"The PBS TV Series, -not- the David Duchovny film..","This series has very well chosen scientists who say very interesting things. Several of my favorite authors including Peter D. Ward, Simon Conway Morris, and Stephen Jay Gould provide explanations for their ideas on the subject. Compared to similar efforts, the animations of Burgess Shale organisms are a bit stiff and unrealistic. And it's maddening that all of the DNA helices seen in animations are left-handed, i.e. the mirror image of what DNA really looks like. But this series is touching all the right bases, from my p.o.v. and provides much valuable food for thought."
5,Beautiful series,Other reviewers have said it best. It's a very well done series. Ignore the anti-science creationist trolls who gave it 1 star.
1,Have used for yrs and they changed something,"I have been a loyal customer for 20 yrs and in the past 3-4 mnths they changed it adding more laureth sulfates, which is a common skin irritant another name for laureth sulfates is poison a degreaser commonly used to degrease engines, not for our sensitive areas, I used this as a complete body wash and facial wash, now I'm itching in areas I shouldn't have to worry about when using a hypoallergenic feminine wash, and I'm having dry itchy patches all over my body. I don't recommend this to anyone, it's another company that lost sight of how they got where their at, definately would'nt have made it selling chemicals in the feminine wash hypoallergenic section of the store.Last yr they also downsized from the 15oz to 12oz and changed the bottle style, that should've been my que then to stop my purchases."
3,This product works really well. The only negative ...,"This product works really well. The only negative thing about it is its inconvenience. Sprays and powders are easier and produce the same results. But, overall, this product does what it claims to do."
4,Very fresh smelling! It did not bother my ...,"Very fresh smelling! It did not bother my sensitive skin, either. I would definitely recommend it!"
1,I didn't care for this product at all. ...,I didn't care for this product at all. It just wasn't for me. It irritated my skin and I wasn't too happy about that.
4,I really wasn't sure I wanted to test ...,"I really wasn't sure I wanted to test and review Summer's Eve Feminine Wash Hypo-Allergenic Cleanser because, well, it's a private thing, you know? But now I'm glad I did! It sure isn't a product I would've bought to try on my own. I think every woman should have a sample to see what it's all about. The bottle is a large one, and contains enough product to last for a good long time. The """"wash"""" is a gel that isn't thin and bubbles up really nicely. The scent is very light yet still pleasant. Using this product will give every woman a fresh, clean feeling and I can easily recommend it."
4,I enjoyed this product. I have never used ...,"I enjoyed this product. I have never used a feminine wash before, and this wash made me feel clean and worry-free about odor. The feminine wash was very cleansing, and did not cause me any problems. I would recommend this to my friends."
4,This feminine wash is another good product from ...,"This feminine wash is another good product from Summer's Eve. It has a nice powder-fresh fragrance, and left me with a nice, clean feeling. However, I did not notice any significant difference between using this product and my regular nicely-scented soap. I would say that because it's hypo-allergenic, those who have problems with itching or burning due to soap should try this product. I would recommend it to family and friends if I knew they were having irritation from soap. The feminine wash combined with a Summer's Eve Vinegar and Water douche makes for a very clean and refreshing Summer's Eve experience."
4,I have seen this product in the stores ...,"I have seen this product in the stores for some time now and I always wondered if it was good or not. I liked it. What I liked most about the feminine wash was that it was a thick gel, not runny. When you put it on a washcloth, it stays there. It lathers up well, too. I would recommend this product to a friend anytime."
2,"The product had a nice, refreshingly clean smell. ...","The product had a nice, refreshingly clean smell. Honestly, however, it wasn't something that was really necessary. I was tempted to use it to clean all over my body, although that would have defeated the purpose of it being a female hygiene wash. My husband commented that it took away """"the smell that made me, me."""" I never determined if that was good or not."
3,More of a mystery than a romance,"In the cassette version of Masquerade, the relationship between Remy and her lover doesn't really factor in to most of the story, and is left open, allowing the book to become more of a mystery novel than a romance.Synopsis: Waking from a head injury, Remy Jardin finds herself in the middle of a life she can't remember. A member of one of the wealthiest families in New Orleans, the lover of a man her family despises, and the guardian of a dark secret that someone is willing to kill for."
2,"Oh, the shame!","Living abroad and starved for English language books drove me to read Masquerade, one of the few available options. What a book. You want to say that it's a must-read on its own terms, but you can't- the best you can do is that it's an okay-read. The prose is stilted and repetitive, and while Dailey is decent at using this repetition to build up suspense, she doesn't take it anywhere, so it just kind of fizzles. Furthermore, the love story set in the middle may provide a parallel, but it has no place in her novel- she either couldn't come up with enough plot or couldn't devise a way to throw in a third love scene between the two main characters. I'm new to the romance genre, but if this is among the best of what it has to offer, I'll be searching elsewhere for good reading soon. Masquerade is a nice try, but the plot isn't compelling, and the steamy scenes just aren't steamy enough. All in all, read it if you have to, but try to avoid it."
5,perfect,This pan works just as it should. Catches all the powder and pours it all into the case flawlessly. You won't be sorry.
5,Mutter proves that Beethoven's music is Transcendental.,"Mutter provides us with another stunning interpretation of the most transcendental Violin Concerto of all time. Unlike her contemporaries, she never looks at this concerto from a purely violinistic standpoint. As learned from Karajan, she looks only from an ""eagle's eye view"". So call it mannered, call it showboating, but you can never deny the transcendental depth, that she probes into this music. Simply stunning.Thanks, Mutter!!"
1,A taffy pull?,"Yikes...this is frightful. Ms. Mutter's performance is a mess in so many ways and places that a taffy pull was the metaphor that kept intruding on my consciousness....s-t-r-e-t-c-h and fold and s-t-r-e-t-c-h and fold the music to the point of making me yell something rude at the speakers. I don't listen to music to hear the performer play the instrument per se, I listen to hear the performer play and perhaps illuminate the music. I didn't get my nickel's worth here. The only illumination was the glow from my impatient-with-the-antics eyes glaring into the middle distance."
1,Mutter's affectation,"I am shocked that something as sublime and classical as Beethoven's violin concerto can be played in such an affected and self conscious a manner. Similar maanerisms can be found in her recordings of Kreutzer and Spring but to a lesser degree. Clearly, Mutter does not appear to understand what it means to observe fidelity to a score and to the spirit in which a work is written."
2,"Too little, too late","Ms. Mutter comes alive in the later movements, but by then the listener may have lost interest. The first movements are flat, almost dull, and devoid of the passion this piece demands and deserves. If you listen to the whole recording you will understand why Ms. Mutter has so many fans, but few listeners will get that far."
3,"Much too tame concerto, but a nearly perfect romance.","I've been listening to guite a few versions of Beethoven Violin Concerto ever since I saw that collaboration of Miss Mutter and the late great Karajan on a television program. That was quite some years ago, and Miss Mutter herself had said that she would have played it very differently now.Personally, I prefer the earlier version. Always elegant she has been, the earlier version has that youthful robustness which I reckon is more suitable for the piece, even with the slower tempo.I agree with my fellow review that it was too little too late. It wasn't really warmed up until the last piece, Romance No.2, which was played to near perfection. Often when I listen to that track I feel as if the violin was not played, but singing, all by itself. Can't praise more than that.Overall, Miss Mutter was at her very best, and, shall we say, not her very best."
5,From A Different View,"In Classical music, in which is never considered 'Popular' music in record stores and the general audience, Violin and Piano have been and are clearly the 'star' instruments. As a person who listens to Alternative music (Bjork, Tori Amos, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, David Bowie and others) more than Classical music, the details the previous reviewers were commenting on were useless to me.Anne-Sophie Mutter and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, for me, are the only known violinists that makes me want to listen to classical music. In this recording, Mutter is simply breathtaking and remakes the boring (to most people) 'great' concerto into a remarkable paradise of creativity.This recording has made me dig deeper into classical music, yet her previous Beethoven recording made me feel nauseated and bored just the same as recordings by Joshua Bell and Itzhak Perlman."
2,Buy Tony Hawk instead,"This game is basically a dulled down version of tony hawk's pro skater, with poorer control and less creativity. It isn't much fun to play. Tony Hawk is 100 times better, so if you want a game like this, go for that one."
3,make sure you understand what you're in for,"The main attraction this book held for me was the fact that it is not ""european"" fantasy. Instead, the backdrop offers us a middle eastern flair, and in my mind this made all the difference in the world because other than that, the book really is your standard fantasy fair. The characters are two dimensional, the plot is a little above average, but still never really takes off, and the demons are unconvincing.If you are looking for a great read, great literature, or anything that will move you, move on. If you are looking for something that is a little different to pass the time in between your series favorites, then this may be worth a shot. (One bonus is that even though it is part of a series, this book works perfectly fine as a stand alone. Therefore, if you do not like it enough to move on, then you have not lost anything.)"
2,Startingly disappointing,"I was very disappointed int this book. I look forward to non-european based fantasy, but this book didn't deliver. The demons were pretty one dimensional as villains, the plot predictable and forced and the payoff at the end wasn't worth the bother"
1,Death Tube,"I'm not sure where to begin with this one.I guess I'll start with the fact that the only kind of entertainment I got from this one is thatI was completely perplexed the whole time. This film never at any time explains any sort of who, what,when, or where. So personally if I had it to do over again I wouldnt have done anything all all."
2,Clunky editing,"This is a decent video set but I wish it was edited more professionally,...starts and stops abruptly - I will continue to use it and see if I can get past the clunkiness of the segues. Other than that - good for beginners but very distracting...."
5,Yoga,This has helped me feel alot better and added some strength also.The breathing exercises have been very relaxing and I use those often to unwind and just relax for some me time.Really like how the practices are done.
4,I liked it,"It was one I chose simply based on the summary. It has 3 dvd'd in it and is a perfect tool for those just starting or others as it has one for flexibility, one for stress relief and one for beginners."
1,The worse yoga video ever,"You have to be the ultimate beginner to use these videos and I mean a super duper begineer. The 90 minute section is so slow that I almost fell asleep by watching this. I was coming back from an injury and was looking for a slower pace and less challenging poses, but come on.. this is bad. I should have known that $21.00 for 3 videos was too good to be true."
1,what the shame,I have ordered this DVD - yoga set - Yoga for beginners & beyond from USA. And there is the problem because I live in United Kingdom and my DVD-player does not expect dvd because of wrong region 1. I did not know about this information :(
1,Not for those wanting a workout,"My wife wanted this and now it's sold on ebay. Not for those wanting a workout, it is truly for a beginner. very boring. Slow to watch. There is better Yoga DVD's on the market."
1,YOGA,"Sorry to say I haven't even taken this out of the box yet, when I do, then I will rate this item"
5,Love It,"Great teaching has made it real easy for me to start learning yoga. The instructors are calm and clear in their directions and there are many things to do on each video. The scenary is pretty to look at when you look at the screen when needed, though the verbal cues are also easy to follow on their own. Love it."
2,You're not really buying 3 DVDs...,"I don't like to give bad reviews but I was not impressed by this product. I bought these to teach with, but they are not the quality I was hoping for.The sequences were so split up that relaxation was hard to accomplish if not impossible.I was also surprised at how much REPEATED FOOTAGE is on each DVD. Don't pay for the same footage arranged into different sequences!!! It is as if they shot all the poses and then cut and pasted each pose into a choppy routine. I would've liked better to have seen one instructor go through a ""workout"" all at once.The image is of three DVDs in their own cases, but the item I received was one DVD case with all three DVDs in it."
5,Has helped me with coordination and balance in 4 days,"I bought this DVD years ago and played it a handfulf times and then placed it on my shelf and forgot I owned it until I began losing my coordination and balance and my quality of life was failing, I saw an article on how yoga helped a paratrooper begin to walk again after years on crutches. This man last 140 pounds and is now running. I thought I would try yoga for myself and after finding this tape and trying it myself just 4 days ago I can boost that I have improved at least 30 %. I am no longer wobbling and even my knees feel better and they have hurt for years. I will say today is 5th day and I have not worked it and already feel like I am missing a very valuable part of my day. This is working and can't wait for the Spring to get h ere and I am able to walk the block again with my beautiful standard poodles. Buy it, do it and it works!Element: Yoga for Beginners"
2,Didn't Care for This,"I love yoga and thought that my boyfriend would enjoy it too. Since he is a beginner, I decided to buy this DVD. It was really slow and not the workout I was looking for. If you are looking for a relaxing DVD, this would be great. If you are looking to really workout and feel it the next day, skip this box set."
2,Not really what was expected,"I didn't realize that these were not set routines, but rather series of poses, with breaks in between each pose. Therefore, it is up to you to make your own transitions. I wish that I had known that prior to purchasing. I figured that I would be a little advanced for these dvd's in terms of yoga knowledge, but right on par in terms of strength and flexibility.Unfortunately I was right on the first account and wrong on the second. It's still waaaay to easy. Most of the inflexible DVD uses a chair for balance, making it totally useless to me, as being of average flexibility and in my 20's, I can touch my toes with no problems. I think a more appropriate name for this DVD set would be yoga for elderly or less mobile people as those are the types of modifications it provides. Overall, I would not purchase or recommend."
2,it's just okay.,"too beginners. if you haven't contact or try any class. it's probably better for you. One thing is good, the move is easy. But routines moves not really stretch to full body. It's just okay."
2,"The workouts are good, but not as good as a previous DVD we owned, we are using it. Because we were use to a different sytle it","The workouts are good, but not as good as a previous DVD we owned, we are using it. Because we were use to a different sytle it feels different to us, we will like it the more we use it."
1,Returned,Discs did not work properly in my DVD player. The small amount of one of the DVD's I watched was impossible to follow.
2,You need a chair,I do not like any of these routines. I am in now way advanced but this is tooo basic. It is like kindergarden yoga. And you need a chair! I should have returned it but now it's too late.
5,Very cool,It's my first time doing yoga and I like it. Low impact but challenging. Definitely worth the cash. All you need is a yoga mat.
5,Great DVDs,"This set of DVDs covers everything you need - if you are starting out and need extra work, to targeting issues to having workouts to wake up and go to sleep to.I borrowed one of the DVDs for a couple of weeks from a friend who has been practicing a few years and who started out with the one to increase flexibility. (She also has the other DVDs and uses them all the time) This DVD is very good to get you started if you have not done yoga or are early in your yoga practice, really helped me get a basis with assistance and then move along.Stress Relief is usuable by pretty much anyone with routines designed to help stress issues, digestion, hips, neck and so on. The relaxtion routines are easy to do and very effective. Though Stress relief has some routines for morning and evening, AM/PM has a wide variety of routines for the morning and evening.I was able to mix and match as I worked through things and there is a ton of variety. Will be able to use this for a long, long time."
5,This is top notch.,"I am a novice. But I like the peace yoga seemed to give people who practiced it. Just want to say I am still a novice but improving. If you are new to this take it slow. You will get better and better. I expect to be proficient in about 10 years. (Smile). But I'm an old fart and it is kind of hard to get some of the positions, so I modify to suit my body. I like to exercise with my Great-Granddaughter. She shows me up and I still have fun.This is something parents can do along with their children. It's fun, inexpensive, it will definitely calm everyone down and the best part is it will make you closer to each other. So have fun and enjoy."
4,Great results in two days!,"I bought this dvd to help with my flexibility, neck issues and hip issues. Within two days I felt better. The programs are divided out according to what you want/need and the time for each segment is listed. I was surprised at how many options I had to choose from. If you are looking for a flowing 30-60 minute yoga routine you will not like this format. It is pieced together and each segment is in the menu. I also purchased a 3 dvd set for my 24 year old son who is just starting yoga and he loved the hip segments; he works at an office and sits all day. He too noticed the quick relief on the hips. The leader talks and moves very slowly which helps get the full effect from the poses. Highly recommended for anyone with hip, neck and back issues - I love it!"
5,Love The Selection,"Between the three DVDs there is great seleection of yoga to work with. I really like the fact that one helped focus on beginners and the inflexible types, which helped me along."
2,No variation,This video is great for absolute beginners who want to focus on the breathing and meditation aspect of yoga. I wasn't an absolute beginner and I definitely didn't want to just focus on the meditation. What really ruined it for me was the lack of variation in routines. Every routine was essentially the same one made longer or shorter.
4,Nice introduction to yoga for this novice,"I recently decided to try yoga, both as a way to shake up my workout routine and to provide some stress relief. The wide range of routines and the positive reviews prompted me to purchase this set. I've never attended an actual yoga class, which I'm sure is unwise, from a possible injury perspective. So far, so good - knock on wood! I found most of the routines easy to follow along to, although, as a beginner, I spent more time focusing on the instructor, rather than myself. I'm sure that will change as I improve and gain experience.I enjoy doing a short routine on a weekend morning and a longer routine to wind down at night during the workweek. I have not yet tried the ""Inflexible People"" routines, as that's not a problem for me, but I plan to check it out to see if there are some useful stretches.The instructor's voice is soothing, and the Antigua setting is beautiful."
4,Great for beginners,"Great for beginners, easy step by step instructions. Three DVDs for the price of one. A bargain for those wanting to learn yoga."
4,Yoga set - Barbara Benagh,"This is a good set for someone just becoming familiar with yoga. It does give the user a variety of routines to choose from. The instructor really is good. She gives good cues, good instruction and there's no pseudo-spiritual, annoying talk - for those who are not into that. I also like it because there's no annoying music, just the sound of the waves from the beautiful location where it is filmed. It's great to keep up with your yoga practice at home, and especially if you're looking for routines to help you de-stress or get a good night's sleep. I would not particularly recommend it for someone who is looking for a faster-paced, more challenging yoga practice. But after all it is a Beginner's Set, and it does accomplish what it sets out to do."
4,The slow yoga DVD,"This is my first set of yoga DVD's. I have used them about three times so far. I found them to be quite slow. I understand that yoga is meant to slow you down, relax and breath, but it still felt like I was just lying there a little too much. Overall I thought the quality was very good I just wish it were a little more intense. I could quite possibly be an intermediate instead of a beginner so this actually might not have been the right product for me personally but if you are a TRUE beginner this is the DVD set for you!"
3,A little too fast but good for beginners,I have never done yoga before except on my Wii fit. I got these dvd's for the winter because it is really hard to get out and exercise in the Winter where I live. The disks did not arrive as the picture states. There were 3 disks all piled on top of each other in one dvd box. I was really disappointed. As for the disks themselves. I found it was a great stretching routine but was a little too fast for me. It tells you to lay on the floor where you can not see the tv screen and starts going through all of these different poses. The more you watch it the more you get the hang of things but for a beginner dvd I would have thought they would teach you the poses first then go into a routine.
3,Definitely for beginners,"Well organized and good instructional video in beautiful peaceful setting, but very basic and low intensity. I'd done yoga classes before--though I don't consider myself more than a novice--and I expected more traditional poses and greater intensity."
3,for the inflexible beginner,I am a beginner so this was good..but it is a bit slow paced and one dvd is entirely for inflexible people..which is not me. So I can really only make use of one dvd and part of another which is a little frustrating but overall good set for extreme beginners.
3,Not what I expected,"While the video quality is good and there are many options for what yoga videos you can watch, I was disappointed to discover that there isn't a fluid program (that I could find) - the videos are collections of poses, but they aren't continuous. I've found better yoga workouts on Youtube, for free..."
3,okay,"The dvds were okay. There is a lot of talking and explaining about the art of yoga. wasnt so much looking for that, just some basic exercises."
5,Great Yoga,I am loving using this set of DVDs since it covers everything I need to learn yoga from basics to more.It is real easy to find and select what you need or want to work on and there are many different poses that I have learned.
4,review,"three dvd's in one box, only tried one so far- but fun and fast. Most sessions are done between 15 and 45 minutes. Great for beginners but not boring to more experienced people."
3,Decent product,"This is a decent product for beginners, although the transitions between activities is not smooth. You do one activity and then all of a sudden you find the dvd pause and you are on to the next activity."
2,Not what I was expecting...,"This is very basic - even too basic for a beginner. I did not care for how there is a voice over rather than the instructor speaking. Oddly, I found it to be very distracting. I was hoping to learn techniques geared toward mind as well as body relaxation, unfortunately, this was not the case. I am sure many getting into yoga do so to learn those relaxation methods yoga is known for, myself being one of these individuals. It just did not assist in this area as I thought it would based on the product description. I am sure many people will enjoy this - it was just not for me."
2,Good if......,"You have NEVER EVER tried yoga and/or are EXTREMELY inflexible! I do yoga and yin yoga regularly so this is WAY too easy for me....and the flow...there really isn't one. Suddenly you are standing from sitting, and then vice versa. It does not flow from one position to another. Very choppy."
3,Rough editing,"The first disc, AM/PM yoga, has great poses, but I quickly realizes the poses are roughly cut-and-pasted together. The second disc, essential yoga, has mis-matched video and audio. The video part of the demonstration is great, the postures are very professional. The accompanied vocal instruction, however, does not match up to the moves of the video. The narrator frequently mistakes the left and right side and often leaves out narrating the next steps. This can be very confusing for people following the videos at home. The instructor also does not provide cool-down poses."
1,Not really liking this,I bought this because it said it was for beginners but I really have to say I'm not fond of it. It doesn't teach you the moves ahead of time and moves pretty quickly. Maybe for someone who had already had some yoga experience it would be okay but I never have and found it hard to follow. When you're face down on the floor and they tell you to do a specific move you have to continually look up at the tv defeating the purpose of the stretching. I'll keep using it and maybe it will get easier as I go. The seller was great though.
2,"Interesting, Odd and Incomplete","Driftwood indeed! The strange volume of forgotten lore from the nineteenth century American stage could be of interest to theater historians. What is odd about it is the completely haphazard way it is structured. It has very odd priorities for a work of history including a chapter wholly devoted to stories of the many (apparently) actors who died onstage--literally. Then there is another chapter completely devoted to the burial places of deceased actors. Do I sense a pattern here?The reason this book receives two stars is that it is one of those cheap scans of a library book, hugely overpriced for the printing quality. Like many scanned books, my copy had well over fifty pages that were only partially scanned. This is a big frustration for any reader and would elicit expletives from scholars."
1,WAR - Edwin Starr,This album is a ripoff. Don't waste your money. It is NOT the WAR (song) you think it is.
3,A Harmless Read,"This is book number 5 in the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series nd the two of them are now married and Rina is pregnant. The story really centers around Decker and his partner, Marge Dunn. Rina is in the background and plays a minor role in the development of this story and does seem somewhat extraneous. The characters are rarher well developed and the story tends to move along at a rather good pace. The plot varies from that which is expected and rather predictable to some very good double and triple turns of events. This is a good story which is a harmless read with characters that are of interest. It is fast reading even though it is somewhat forgettable. Take the book for what it is and you will have an enjoyable read."
3,perverted sexual and familial relationships,"this is the most explicit book that I have read of Faye Kellerman's to date. In the past I have enjoyed reading of the evolution of Rina and Peter's relationship and his growing faith. This book was a more typical mystery, and I was disappointed."
4,Very good writer,This was a xmas gift. She said she liked it. But so did I. The book came in very good condition
2,she has been better,"I usually love both faye kellerman and Jonathon Kellerman's books, this one is not one of my favorites. I love mysteries and family type books. odd book.. hopefully she will get better. i have read all peter and rina books, this is the worst of them"
2,A major disappointment,"This is the first Faye Kellerman book I have read. I had previously read reviews about the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series and was looking forward to a good read. I was, however, sorely disappointed. The first half of the book was downright boring, it finally started getting slightly interesting approximately three quarters of the way through, then all of a sudden it just ended without any resolution. The crimes were left unsolved and the murderers and thieves unpunished. I was looking forward to reading the whole series, but now I seriously doubt I would buy another of these books."
1,These guys suck!,"When your guitars are more of a prop than a tool, you're pulling a halifax. When you can't write a song worth two s**ts, you're pulling a halifax. When your whole gimic is a few lousy stints on MTV's lameO reality series ""the real world"", you're pulling a halifax. Basically, you just plain suck. And so does halifax."
3,Well-done emo-tinged punk,"""A Writer's Reference"" is a well-done EP of emo-tinged pop punk. This is basic three-chord minor-key stuff, with some nice arrangements and harmonies. Imagine the sing-along choruses that metalcore bands often have today, minus the metal; the title track, in particular, goes into a gnarly breakdown that would fit well on an Atreyu or Killswitch Engage record. The production is clear yet rough enough around the edges to avoid falling into Jimmy Eat World-type gloss."
4,cathy's pick,I love Adagio's. this cd has MANY of the great ones. I highly recommend for lovers of classical music
4,Slave Raider - 'What Do You Know About Rock 'N Roll?' (Jive),"Put out in 1989, Slave Raider's second album. Some have suggested that this three-lp shock rock / glam metal band from Minneapolis is like a Twisted Sister wanna-be. Tracks that make this CD a keeper - without a doubt are the awesome ""Is There Rock 'N Roll In Heaven?"", ""Sin City Social"", ""Roller Coaster"", the rocking ""The High Priest Of Good Times"" and their cover of Thin Lizzy's ""Jailbreak"". Recommended, as I would for all three of their CD's."
2,Lose the trim plate.....and you are OK.,"Ordered for my boat.This is a 4 pc set which includes the trim panel fitted with countersunk holes on either side.I was way disappointed in this product because nothing fits logically or securely until...............you toss out the trim panel. Lose the trim panel (which is how Sea Dog [pretty decent supplier of marine goods] shows this same product when they sell it) and suddenly the parts fit nicely and the unit will have a smaller footprint/visual presence. If you slide the receptacle through the trim panel in an attempt to mount it as shown in the picture, the receptacle does ....not.....fit snugly; securely, accurately.....at all. It so does ...not....fit nicley like the picture above shows.Using the product without the trim panel will deliver the fit and finish you probably have in mind.Given the poor quality vinyl seal plug that others have described, I will be trying to mount this item out of the sun somehow."
5,Very Good Quality,"This is a very nice adapter. I used it on an ATV and it works great. You can mount it without the rectangle piece. It's got a threaded shaft with a plastic nut, and you can sandwich it in between the hole you mount it in."
2,Won't Hold the Plug,"I have bought two of these and installed them on my motorcycles. They are perfect for that job, and look great. The problem is that nearly every plug I put into the socket will not make contact, or will not maintain contact and will constantly loose power. I use the outlet to power the GPS and cell phone charger, but unless you hold the plug in with your hand, it will shake loose and break the circuit. Sometimes it helps if I wedge a toothpick in the socket to take up some wiggle slack, but that's a pain. It just doesn't do a good job of holding the plug in tight against the electrical contact in the bottom of the socket."
5,12 volt dc port,Bought this to add a port to my motor scooter. It works great and now I have an open port for my gps and I can charge my battery over the winter without removing a cover.
4,Second best,"This is a good product, arrived on time, brand new in box no complaints. It is basically a copy of the original Marinco Sealink 12v outlet only with lesser quality. four stars max, five to the Marinco. I own both. You get what you pay for."
3,Hit or miss!,I ordered two of these sockets. The sockets themselves are large and very solid. My problem is the dust covers. One is like the picture and says marine 12v and the other one isn't large enough to fit the socket and says DC12v socket. I would not recommend this for marine or outside environments. For standard automobile uses it should be fine without the duct cover.
2,"cheaply made, overpriced shipping.","This product is cheaply made, the plastic body is poor quality. The ""rubber"" plug is more plastic than rubber and I question its ability to hold back rain and moisture. They charged me a shipping cost of $9.98, the package came first class postage US Post office labeled commerical base, no surcharge. USPS online says its $1.22 to mail. Heads up 12V Tecnology, if you want more money for your product, ask for it! Don't hide it in shipping costs! My 2 cents worth, save your money, look elsewhere."
2,"1 is ok, the other is hosed",I installed 2 on of these my motorbike ~ a year & not many miles ago. One is still working alright.But the plug falls out of the other & loses contact very easily. It's inferior vs the more $$$ Marinco that they're copied from.
2,Plug falls out,"Installation was quick and easy, it looks nice & the electrical connections themselves seem well built. The problem is, when installed on a vertical surface on a stationary object -with no movement and no vibrations- the plug only makes contact when I press and hold it in. A fix for this is to wedge a toothpick in on the side to hold it, but now I have to carry more gear to make it work. The one I have mounted horizontal facing upwards (with gravity holding the plug in) works a lot better, but I still use a toothpick to make sure it doesn't wiggle out. I will probably replace this plug with a better one when I get time, and keep it in my go-bag as a backup."
1,waste of money,Threads were defective. I could not use the plug because the mounting nut could not screw on to the body of it.
5,Great Product,The waterproof design was perfect for my motorcycle to finally have a power point to charge my electronics. Nice design. works great.
4,"Great prod, don't get me wrong.","I got this socket for my BMW bike (1200 GS) so I could charge my phone, helmet BT kit, etc. great quality and amazing product, but I was expecting it to be much smaller sonI could fit it around the instrument panel. I will make an aluminum plate mount so I don't have to drill such a big hole on the body of my ride."
2,Marine Grade Cigarette Lighter Socket 12 VDC,"This socket had no thought put into the size of the inside diameter of the part that fits over the back part of the socket. The inside diameter of the cover is smaller than the outside diameter of the socket. Basic engineering practices dictate that if you want to slide something over another part, it has to be larger than the part it is going over. DUH!! I can make it work, but I shouldn't have to. Sending it back would cost more that it did to buy."
4,american buffalo in great form,"i was a bit concerned when the liner notes told me i wasn't going to hear any ""dirty"" amplified harp, exactly what i love, but you don't miss that with norton blowing. his playing is so fully nuanced and textured that a mic might even have distorted some of those wonderful tones. and while you won't find any lowdown swamp boogie here, or delta grinders, or led zep rockers, you will find plenty of smoky lounge crawlers and freeway accelerators with smoldering guitar if that's your taste. in fact norton is a master of styles and playing modes, sounding now like the harmonicats, then like larry adler, and all with a rocking, bluesy feel. he sings almost as well as he plays, too. anybody catch his playing in the movie ""the dog pound shuffle"" some years back, where norton does the harp work for a canadian drifter played by david soul? beautiful stuff."
3,Prime Early Alice,"First off, R.E. is my dad. I'm Trenton. Now.... I bought this cd a while ago at a used cd store and I like it. It's Alice's very first live recordings from 1969 and I think it brings out some of his original sound. However, it's not an official release. Alice recieves no profit off of it. It's been released under so many labels and names most Cooper websites do not even have the full list. Two songs ARE NOT EVEN ALICE!!!! ""Ain't It Just Like A Woman"" and ""Goin' To The River"" is someone else. The best songs are ""Freak Out Song"" and ""Nobody Likes Me"" (which are Alice). I'm a collector of Alice Cooper and I'm very glad I got this album. I just wish it would be released officially."
2,Shoddy release,"As many times as this recording has been re-released you would thing at least one of the record companies would have the decency to correct the song titles. For one thing ""Ain't That Just Like A Woman"" and ""Going To The River"" are not even Alice Cooper so they should be eliminated (along with the pasted together contrived medley at the end of the disc). While I am not sure of the exact title of ""Freak Out"" and ""Nobody Likes Me"" is one of the few that are correct, ""Painting A Picture"" is actually called ""No Longer Umpire"" and ""Science Fiction"" is ""Field Of Regret"", both originally from his first album ""Pretties For You"". Both ""For Alice"" and ""I Wrote A Letter To Mother"" are actually the same song titled ""Lay Down and Die, Goodbye"" from his second album ""Easy Action"". It is quite obvious the record companies don't care and just want to cash in on the name of Alice Cooper."
2,Vintage Alice Cooper,"This recording is really old. Made in the late 60's when The Alice Cooper Band was just starting out. If you want to hear stuff like ""I'm Eighteen"" or ""School's Out"" this album is not for you. Die hard fans could get into it for historical value, but Alice Cooper and his band have so much material that is way better than what's on this album. I bought it when I was a teenager on vinyl and it was called ""Freak Out Song"". I haven't listened to it in years, it's really not very well recorded either."
3,Confusing!,"When I started reading this book, I felt like I had already read it before. Finally I looked it up and realized the other book (Naughty but nice) was about Kate's cousin Cassie....the story seemed so familiar, because I had already read Naughty but Nice, that I just could not get into it. The plot was good, but I felt like the characters lacked depth and emotion. This was one of the first books I've read in a long time (and I read about 2 a week) that I was glad when I finished it.What really made me sad about not liking this book is because I've read several of Leslie Kelly's books and they have all been pretty good."
4,so glad to have found this again,"I owned this cd once before and it has been lost, I have always enjoyed the beauty of this music cd, and the relaxation that it brings.I was completely surprised and pleased to be able to find it on AMAZON, and at how quickly and efficiently my order was shipped."
2,"Interesting in parts, but not that great","There were parts of this book that were interesting or useful, but I felt like the tone was often sort of condescending. The flow of new information was very slow and so I eventually got bored. I also didn't feel like the book went very deeply into looking at color, which is what the book is supposed to be about. This book did not live up to my expectations."
3,Chinese ceramic cook pot cracked,"I purchased this Joyce Chen J90-0704 6-Quart Stoneware Chinese Cooking Pot and used it for cooking rice. After a few times using it already, suddenly made a loud noise on the hot stove and cracked open on the bottom draining all the water on the hot cooking surface. Big mess.I would love it if it would last..."
2,unreliable,"This book is a mass of allegations and assertions and ignores inconvenient facts in favor of sensationalized storytelling based mainly on gossip and cognitive leapfrog. Entertaining, yes, if you love history but enjoy the peculiar experience of having your blood pressure raised by seeing it badly reinterpreted. There are far better and more reliable works on this time period and this subject."
3,Occam's Razor vs. Sherlock Holmes (Spoiler alert!),"An enjoyable book, though it gets a bit bogged down in the middle with court intrigue. It begins with the famous A. C Doyle quote from Sherlock Holmes: ""Once you've eliminated the impossible, what remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" I would counter with Occam's Razor: ""The simplest explanation is usually true."" Was the Man in the Iron Mask really D'Artagnan? Probably not, but it's an interesting theory, none the less. I will leave more expert readers to tell why the theory doesn't hold water, but the book is a page turner, and the story is well told. And I was a bit surprised to find out how much of Dumas' novels were based on actual events and people. A good read, but don't take it as gospel."
5,Hallelujah excellent!,"I am sooooo glad that I purchased this DVD! Trust me, these legends PERFORM!!! What a beautiful way to enjoy praising the Lord at home as you listen to the beautiful vocal gift of harmonized 'Gospel' singing from the soul! Buy it, you won't regret it. I am VERY pleased! This deserves more than 5 stars!!! As a matter of fact, I'm now ordering Volume 1 and can bearly wait until it comes!!!"
2,B-1,"Kind of raw. Not what I expected. Lou Rawls looked out of place on some songs. One of the Mighty Clouds of Joy seems to ""hog"" in all the song by other artists. One or two bright moments though and should have expanded on the artists history more than they did."
2,Rock the boat,"This game would be fun if I could get over feeling sick from the 360 degrees of flying. It has the same effect on my roommate. If you get sea sick or get sick on fast rides at the amusement park, this game is not for you. It does take some practice trying to control casper."
2,There is only one word for this game...STUPID,"The only reason I gave this game more than 1 star is because the graphics, and the storyline are almost amazing.. the rest of the game is tedious, frusterating, and extremely short. For one thing there are only 5 levels, the developers got away with this because it is overwhelming hard. And when you die you start all the way in the beginning of the stupid level. Believe it or not that's all I have to say about this game, short, hard, and dumb."
1,A HORRIBLE GAME,"This isn't the actual score I'd give this game, in real life it's a 0.25 out of 5. Everything is crap and nothing else! I absolutely hated, loathed, despised, and wished for it to burn in Hell it was so bad. The gameplay is repetitive and absolutely useless, the graphics look like s***, the control is awful, the music totally sucks, and the acting is crappy too! Throughout the game you'll mostly find yourself collecting nothing but jewels, killing brain-dead enemies, and doing tasks for absolute idiots who have the ability to do it themselves. So if you're looking for a great PS2 game, get Guitar Hero I & II or God of War I & II."
1,Not good on Bedford,"This book is culled from old newspaper clippings. Early Americanjournalism was very biased and short on research. Garbage in, garbage out. The really good books on Forrest include Wyeth's outstanding That Devil Forrest and Morton's book about Forrest's Artillery. Morton was his chief of Artillery and later served as Tennessee's Secretary of State."
4,Interesting and informative book on repairing pottery,"Repairing Pottery and Porcelain is an in-depth guide to repairing pottery and porcelain. It gets pretty technical at times, but it is written in such a way that a beginner can easily learn the art of pottery repair. Instead of offering only one solution to a problem (i.e. cleaning), it offers many, explaining the differences in each."
2,Sensuous Sax - The Touch,"I was a bit disappointed in this CD. There was nothing wrong with it except that I have heard them in the past and I felt that this was not one of their better CD's. Hence, I returned the CD to Amazon who I feel is a very user-friendly site and the ONLY one I do any business with on the internet."
3,"maybe she did, maybe she didn't","I knew before I opened this book that it was going to trouble me on two counts. Firstly, Susannah Clapp''s book is not a biography: it is a '`portrait of a writer"". In other words, the incisive drive of the biographer was about to be replaced with the sycophantic anecdotal mush of a close friend (Clapp was once Chatwin's editor). And secondly, this book would possibly render Chatwin as real, and that really wouldn't do. As all Chatwin's work was hinged on the fact he was always present by his absence, to paint the author back in Clapp was about to deface the work of art that Chatwin had made his life.I'd like to say that Clapp managed to surmount these difficulties for me, but unfortunately, she didn't. However, she also did not fail to surprise me"
5,Good,"This was a pretty good book. It's mainly about Trent getting into UCLA so his parents buy him a car. After that he starts partying and getting a little carried away with things and there's a big accident in the end. This is also about Jade's Dad deciding not to pay for her college education unless she goes to Oregon. Tia's decided to not go to college next year. There's also a big part about Jessica and Elizabeth. Jessica feels lonely because there's nothing big going on in her life like there is in everybody elses. Elizabeth enters a contest to win a scholarship to a school in England, while Jessica thinks the only good thing in her life right now is that Elizabeth will be going to SVU with her. Jeremy gets an acceptance letter to the University of Arizona which upsets Jessica even more. It was a pretty good book in my opinion."
2,Not worth your $'s,"This book isn't all that great. Trent gets accepted into a premed program, so his parents buy him a car, and he starts blowing off schoolwork because ""his life is set."" Tia and Jeremy keep telling him he's got a problem, he doesn't listen, and at the end of the book he ends up crashing his car into a tree. Yeah, great book.Jessica's feeling ignored and worthless because nobody thanked her for organizing her parents anniversary party, and then Jeremy tells her he's going to college in Arizona after all.At the Scope office Liz finds out about a contest for high school seniors to win a scholarship to some school in England, so she decides to enter. She writes a story about the European music scene (or something like that) with the help of her little whipping boy Jeff. Then Liz feels guilty because Jess tells her how happy she is that they'll be going to SVU together. This whole storyline is pointless, really, because we all know Liz ends up at SVU anyway."
2,Filter works well...BUT,"Received my new countertop water filter in timely fashion and it NOW works well. I had to go to Home Depot to purchase a faucet adaptor ($5.00) as none is included with the product...even though it clearly states it is included. The supplier's response was basically...it's your responsibility. The screw on fitting supplied has a female thread while every kitchen faucet I ever owned requires a male thread to attach where the aerator is. The posted ad on Amazon also says 1 Micron filter included, again not so, packing slip says ""Filters Sold Seperately"" and I was charged an additional $10.89. Also an extra $.79 for a plastic wrench to open the filter. The unit works very well, removing any processed water ""smells"". A definite plus for a city boy (Philly) looking to ditch the bottled water habit!"
5,"The ex governor of New York named ""Joan Sutherland Day""","Yes, Rudy , the ex Republican governor of New York was the biggest Joan Sutherland fan. He declared a Joan Sutherland Day in New York when he was governor. I can't say this if it's not true. You can look this up, it's a fact. He didn't name any other days for other opera singers.Yes, that how great La Stupenda is.This is her greatest collection of role she's ever done.I have it and love it.But also check out the ""Art of the Prima Donna"", and her ""Lucia di Lammermoor"".You will discover a soprano voice that is the most beautiful in tone and a true virtuoso in coloratura display.Note the Concerto for Coloratura and soprano. No one can sing it except Joan Sutherland.Brava, Dame Joan!"
5,Loved It,"I loved the way the author sculpted each of the characters' personalities to the point of the reader being able to identify with each of them, love them and even hate them. The fact that this was a true story makes it even more heartwarming. The strength of this family as they endured such hard times made me feel very respectful of my ancestors to give us the life we have today. If you loved the triumphs and lessons learned from 'Little House on the Prairie', you'll LOVE 'Blackberry Winter'! I can't wait to read another book from this author!"
4,Excellent piano for massage and relaxation,This CD is now being used in my massage therapy practice - it is very relaxing and I particularly like it because I like piano. My clients are enjoying the sense of tranquility and joy.
4,holiday rescue,This CD has been invaluable to me during the hectic holiday time. It was background for our Thanksgiving meal and it is something I put on when things get a little too busy and also when I sit to pray in the morning. You can't beat the price either for quality music.
5,Perfect for relaxation!!!,"As a Reiki practitioner, this is a perfect CD for my clients. It brings total relaxation and allows you to enter a complete state of peace. Peace of Mind is the perfect title for this CD."
3,you get what you pay for,"given the price, i can't really complain. if asked to describe this cd i'd call it new age elevator music."
5,Fits perfectly within my Toyota (06 4Runner),Hard to find just a couple of boxes. Fits perfectly witin the console holder. Fits in other Toyota models also.
5,Great hard to find item,"These kleenex tissues are the correct size for the tissue dispenser in our '99 SUV. Since they are not available in the stores any longer, it is great to be able to buy a case of them on-line so that we can keep kleenex in our car."
5,Why did Kleenex discontinue this useful product?,"This is the second batch we have gotten since KC discontinued their junior sized box. The Kleenex Junior box has been replaced by a soft package that among other things makes it difficult to remove a single sheet at a time and, of course, this makes it awkward to us while driving!"
5,Fifties Forever,"This 3 CD set of original Fifties hits is terrific. All the selections are great, and the sound quality is superb."
1,"A terrible, terrible waste of money","Given the plethora of other videos for learning German--and other foreign languages--that are all for sale at Amazon.com as well, you can really spend your money far better by doing a Video Search for ""German"" and looking at nearly any other product. This one just ain't worth it."
2,Waves of cohesion,"2 1/2Impressive elements abound with this jazz-fusion vocalist, but rarely does Purim settle on establishing a melody as memorably pretty as the first track, choosing to relish in an artsy spontaneity most of the time instead."
3,Disjointed,"This album lacks the feeling of unity most Flora albums have. Taken individually though, most of the songs are pretty strong. Would that Flora had worked with McCoy more down through the years. Hermeto plays Yamaha electric grand piano. Good riddance to that anomaly of a musical instrument. Yet for some reason, it always sounds appropriate in Brazilian music."
3,A little disappointed,"Very cool and accurate depiction of the General Lee. The car arrived quickly in the mail, just about a week after it was ordered. Within the first hour of it being out of the box, the door handle fell off. I know that this isn't really made for playing with, it is more of a object to view on a shelf, but it didn't take much activity to get the handle to fall off. I haven't checked with seller to see if they would replace or repair it - so it is possible that they would correct the problem."
1,A real disappointment ...,"I ordered the model by ERTL General Lee, instead I was handed the model of General Lee by Johnny Lightning. Completely different from the picture of General Lee in Amazon.com (do not open the doors, the trunk does not open, and built badly)Product you really poor quality. Money poorly spent. I never expected, that an object that many people considered collectible, were manufactured in China with a quality so poor.A real disappointment ...A shame."
2,Not what's advertised,"I purchased this for my son as a birthday gift. The main reason I selected this seller and model was because the photos indicate that the trunk and hood open. The car did arrive in the time specified... however... the trunk did NOT open. What a disappointment!!! I have ordered from Amazon over the last several years and have never been misled or had an issue like this. I hope false advertising isn't the new norm.Buyers, if you expect to receive what is being advertised.... you won't."
2,purposely misleading?,"ordered this for a nephew who is very specific about what he wants when I ordered this I typed in ERTL General Lee & this items was listed as an ERTL but is by a company called Johnny Lightening I am not a expert on this car so will give to him & see if he is happy if not then will return Cannot believe Amazon would allow a company to consistently give incorrect info when describing what they are selling exspecially when shows order is ""fulfilled by Amazon"""
3,Almost Authentic . . .,"I purchased this for my 16 year old step-son who is a car collector. It is almost authentic except 1) the doors are glued on and do not open, 2) Gears are different than car on show and 3) one of the tires hubcaps is different/wrong from the other three which are correct."
5,Boundaryless Organization Fieldbook Review,"The fieldbook is written in a very user friendly way. It provides information that can be used in various ways - presentation slides, workshops, surveys and inteviews. Each tool is explained in great detail - how to use it and the intended purpose. I borrowed a copy from our corporate libary and liked it so much I will order my own personal copy!"
5,I'm Jack The Pumpkin King !,"NECA Tim Burtons The nightmare before christmas series 1 jack is just amazing collectiable this figure's price just getting higher and higher lucky for me I found an amazing deal so this figure has 4 acessories two jack o lantern's, zero and evil pumpkin present. just to warn you NECA's Nightmare Before Christmas jack is very fragile figure cause how thin he is so be very careful I havent had problems with this figure at all I actually had this figure attempt suicide not actually but I'm just really thankful it didnt break cause I would be very ticked off if it did. I'm a huge Tim Burton fan I currently own Coraline with shinning star outfit, the mayor, Dr. finlestein, oogie boogie man and sally but I do tend to get other nightmare before chirstmas characters and all stand very well especially this Jack skellington even though it tryed to jump off one time, any way if you love Nightmare before christmas get this figure."
5,Unexpected Home-run,"This book surprised me. Not only does it give you a glimpse at what designers have debated since the dawn of time, it also gives a very interesting view of how politics, design and manufacturing are so closely tied and how views have evolved over time. I love this book."
3,Ye Olde English for today's American reader,"Even though the information in this book is valuable, you will first need to take a crash course on 19th century British English the way it was used back then. The book is hard to read for someone who speaks American English. I had to re-read articles, especially the oldest ones. Trying to figure out what the point was.I would recommend someone to completely rewrite the articles, preserving the message and translating it for the modern man."
3,"Overall, this product was a decent product. However, ...","Overall, this product was a decent product. However, I didn't like the deodorant scent. I would have preferred unscented. And although the plastic applicator isn't difficult or uncomfortable to use, I'd prefer a cardboard applicator because it's flushable and better for the environment."
5,Magnificent Portraits,One of the better of the Helmut Newton collection of portraits. Was wonderfully surprised. Vendor was great and got product here on time and in top condition. Couldn't ask for more.
3,Enigma Film Score by John Barry,The main theme is wonderful for a reflective mood or for your home movies-photoalbum. But not as good as John Barry's music for Pearl Harbour. Some not so good tracks. I bought it for the main theme.
5,Enigma Music Matches Movie,"One reason I enjoy the movie Enigma so much is that the music so perfectly matches the story, the mood, and the setting. Thus when I found a CD of the Enigma theme music I just had to have it! Its in our timed CD player every night, along with the score from Dances With Wolves. I don't think there is a better score writer in the film industry today than John Barry. This score is subtle, so you are not overwhelmed with sound as is the case with so many films today; yet it powerfully pulls you right into the drama and the romance. And its great listening on its own as well. The simple recuring run of notes through the score is beautifully done. It stays in your head hours after you have listened to the CD."
5,My First CD of Randy's,"What a voice, Always knew that he had a unique voice. He's in a class of his own, with nobody even close. This cd is great not a song on it that I don't like. Especially like the track ""That was us"". Randy sings music that is closer to real country than most of the artist's out there today with little that would be considered ""crossover"". I plan on purchasing lots more of his work."
3,required reading in california,This book is required reading if you plan to take the distribution exam. Other texts go into greater detail with pictures and expanded sections on safety etc but this book has the information needed for taking the dhs exam.
4,Nice knife,Good knife for the purpose. Adequate friction locking system for the sheath. I used it in saltwater over the Thanksgiving Holiday and washed it off each time after coming out of the water. There are some small rust spots on it at the machined areas (cutting surfaces) but they have been removed. Just need to make sure it is cleaned after each use.
3,river runner,unusual for gerber knives this one was rather dull-took some time and effort to make an edge. Nice sheath retention system 3 clicks to hold knife firmly in place. practical sheath.
3,"Creativity & Disease: How Illness Affects Literature, Art & Music.","Needed this book to help me prepare for a lecture, ""Deathbed Art."" It was helpful but didn't inspire me to read the sections that weren't focused on my particular theme or the artist, Manet. I've donated it to the Museum. It's safe there & I can find it again if I need it."
5,Richard - Massage Therapist,"This is a great CD for massage. The combination of strings and woodwinds bring the feeling of waves of release as the tension just melts away! There are other good CDs with an Eastern influence, but this is great with a Western orchestral sound."
3,"So so, not warm","The lining is soft. Leather is very thin, but soft. It's just OK for the price. It's not very warm. My fingertips were cold in 55 degrees Fahrenheit."
5,Tristan,I bought these for my wife and she absolutely loves them. The price was right and they are a perfect fit.They took awhile to ship which I thought was ridiculous. Overall a great purchase.
1,Poor stitching and liner quality,"Bought these gloves as a gift but had to return them. The right glove was stitched differently than the left glove so the fingers were all different sizes, some looked bloated and others were way too tiny. The lining is thin and has almost a filmy feel to it. Not a good quality product."
2,Average,Glove sizes are not the same. I ordered 2 pair of size 8 gloves. one black and one brown. Black are to small and the brown are way to big. Just average gloves in my opinion
2,"Nice gloves, but not warm","they are nice, snuggly fitting even on my extremely tiny hands (I got the 6.5 size) however, they are not very warm. They look nice, but they are not warm."
4,Nice Gloves,"The gloves are great and really keep you warm. I had a problem with the size, though, because I've never bought gloves online and I never learned about how gloves are sized. I got them in a 6.5 but I guess for beginners I'd suggest a size equivalent to your shoe size. My shoe size is a 7-7.5 and the 6.5 is small enough to be bothersome. Just a heads up!"
4,fine leather,"gloves are as described with a good fit, but very dark browngave these as a gift and they are very good quality leather, just a little darker than expected"
3,Lovely Gloves but Runs Very Small,"I ordered a size 7, runs very very small. Although these are lovely gloves, they didn't fit. I gave them to my sister who has very small hands. She had to squeeze into them but they were not as tight on her as on me. So if you have tiny hands, these are for you."
5,Leather Gloves,"Really soft leather ... and nicely lined in cashmere. The brown is very dark, almost black. The price is right!"
2,Too Tight,The size is off. It shoul fit like a glove but it is so tight that I cannot have my fingers in all the way. The quality and workmanship is excellent. Get a half size bigger than your normal glove size for a perfect fit.
4,Clear Results,"I used the First Response pregnancy tests both times I was pregnant and a few times that I wasn't. Each time I received an accurate result.I think the test is easy to read, one pink line means you are not pregnant, two pink lines you are. When the test is ""finished"" you can clearly see if it is positive or negative.I have been pleased with the accuracy of the First Response Pregnancy Test. I originally had bought the First Response because I had heard of the name and it was one of the cheaper pregnancy tests. After using it once and getting accurate results, I continued to purchase it anytime I needed a pregnancy test."
1,Inaccurate results plz do not use this product,"Hi,Recently my wife got missed periods continuously for 2 times then we use this product to test the pregnancy we tested 2 times it shoes us the negative results then we waited for 2 more weeks but my wife didn't get a period then we buy another brand clear blue which confirms the pregnancy . Believe after the pregnancy confirmation again we tested as we got 3 test strips surprise still it shows pregnant. Please do not use this inaccurate product. Trust me i was so disappointed for 1 week."
1,First Response should be called Wrong Response,"I bought this on a whim since I was one day late and my body is like clockwork. Imagine my shock when I took two test and one came out positive and the other negative. I was hyperventilating and in deep shock. We were safe but things happen - condoms are not 100% and I was off my pill due to how ill it made me. I made a doc's appointment for blood work while my boyfriend went out to get more tests (since we had mix results). A few negatives later and tears and a sleepless night we found out I was never pregnant.... Happy ending - yes. But we are still traumatized, if this was an accurate test a lot of stress could have been avoided."
3,three negatives,"I never had any luck with First Response. I've always got negatives with them. Since they were branded most accurate, I believed it and my period came a day late. With my first pregnancy, I tried CVS brand and got two positives. Went to the doctor for confirmation and I was indeed pregnant and now I'm a mom.Now, it has been three weeks since I tried two different pregnancy tests brands. I started to feel pregnant (with all the early symptoms) shortly after having a baby in late March of 2011 (wish the date would update with the review). Took four Walmart brand tests, two days apart and got faint positives. A week later, I tried three First Response tests and got all negatives. I'm waiting another week or so until my expected period starts. If I don't start, I will have to get a blood test."
3,Dissapointed with the new FRER,I have always been very satisfied w/ FRER. However this time I purchased FRER and Fact Plus(sold by amazon)as I noticed it was also an early pregnancy test. The results: Fact Plus gave me a faint but very clear positive during the mid afternoon 11 dpo. I used FRER at the same time and got a very hard to see faint line. In dismay I used another FRER test with the same urine sample and received the same result.Thses kind of results make things even more stressful as all we want is a clear answer. I was really shocked that Fact Plus out performed FRER.
3,Mistake,this was a mistake to order this was not thinking...saw something were a guy peed on one of these and it came up positive...it was an indication that he had testicle cancer...
1,Defective!,"I ordered before the same product from the same seller and it worked fine. This box, however, was defective. I used all three tests and no result showed up-it was invalid. It happened with all 3! I'd like to have a refund on this order as I think it was a defective box."
1,Unreliable,I bought a 3-pack from my local grocery store. The package was unopened and was not expired.My girlfriend ended up having to use all three because the first two gave no signal (no control line). Having only 1 out of 3 tests even function does not speak well of this company's quality-control measures.
2,Too high of a defect rate,"I had ordered a box of these and found that one out of the three tests was defective - it had no lines at all, which is a defect. I think there is a way to get in touch with the company for a replacement unit but I couldn't be bothered. I then ordered a second box. Two came up positive but the third in as many days was again defective. I was willing to overlook the first box, but getting two boxes in a row with 1/3 being a dud test is too high for me. If I need to, I'll be getting a different brand of tests next time around."
4,Easy to use,"I've been TTC for about two years, and although I have yet to get a BFP, I always use these tests. They are very easy to use, though a few times I have had a ""phantom line."" That's my only issue with these tests. Then again, I didn't feel like paying $30+ on a pregnancy test I knew would end up negative month after month."
2,Is that a shadow or a positive result?,"I used this test twice, 2 days after my period was due to arrive, and then again at 3 days after aunt flo was supposed to have made her monthly visit. The control line each time was the normal dark pink-purplish color. I used my morning's first urine, of course. There was, what appeared to be, an incredibly faint, pale, shadowy, ghostly little pink line to the left of the control line. My husband and I stared at this little ghost for minutes, trying to decide if what we saw was a line or not. It says on the package that the result line may be lighter than the control line, but it does not say how much lighter. Needless to say, I will retest with another brand.I would not use this test again."
1,Worst response,"Decided to take the test 3 days before my missed period, exactly as the instructions stated. Negative!!! I was crushed. Next morning I went for a blood test which came out positive that I was pregnant. Don't try to sell something if you can't deliver on the promise."
3,Don't use until the day before or day after period.,"Despite the claims that you can use this up to 6 days before your missed period, it doesn't work. There's not a pregnancy test available that can tell you that early. Use it the day before your missed period, the day of your period, or the day after your period for accurate results."
1,not very sensitive,If you have missed your period you should may be able to use this. If you are trying to get pregant I would look for a 10 hcg miu test. I called to see what level of hcg this detected they will not give that information out for business reasons.
2,not as good as they used to be,"These tests used to be the best with my other 3 kids 2005/2006/2008. This time I can't get more than super faint lines which really worried me at first, but other brands are darker and getting increasingly dark. While the First response is still really faint. Even Wondfo brand had a more distinct line. I have since read many similar stories. I think they must have some bad batches out there. I think Amazon needs to have a new catagory for the 6 days early test because they are clearly different and not as good."
1,First Response & Answer are the same,"First Response and Answer are made by the same people. If you have a problem with one buy a different brand than the other. I used Answer twice. The first time faint, very faint, line. The second test no line, took that test four days later. Went to the store and brought First Response to help sort the mystery out only to get home and find out they test were the exact same as the ones I'm having problems with. So just a warning for anyone who cares."
3,I have always used this brand,I have four children and have always used this brand of test to confirm my pregnancy. It has always worked fine before. I am on my fifth attempt at getting pregnant and I had my first false positive. I guess it is bound to happened sooner or later.
5,Right On,Awesome. Told me about 4 days before my missed period and both lines were solid not faint. Just have to get it confirmed by my doctor in a few weeks and it's official! So excited to to have another baby!!!
4,THESE ARE GREAT QUALITY!,"The tests came quickly. Ordered them Saturday and arrived Tuesday, I was especially impressed because Monday was a holiday. The tests are easy to read. Individually packaged, clean and convient, they even came with a free ovulation test! Recommend them, super affordable and well worth it."
1,Doesn't Work,"This pregnancy test didn't work at all for me. I had used Wondfo internet test strips and they started showing a faint line. I then tested with a Safeway brand pregnancy test, which showed an obvious line. Just to be sure I went out and bought the First Response Early test. It showed a complete negative! I was 1 day before my expected period when I took. It. I used the remaining tests that evening and next morning... which also were NEGATIVE. I was really confused, as the Wondfo strip tests continued to get darker. I then went out and got the First Response digital a day after my expected period, and both of those were also negative. I went and got a blood test that same morning, and it was POSITIVE. The First Response brand was horrible for me, and caused a lot of worry. I guess I was the 1% it wasn't accurate on.... which I highly doubt. These are horrible and I wasted $40 on First Response. $5 Wondfo tests, and $9.00 generic Safeway brand test were accurate and much more affordable!"
1,NOT sensitive and NOT the first response you can get,"Ladies, there are better pregnancy tests out there! You can find out DAYS sooner if you are pregnant. Most of these name brand tests, like this one, only pick up your hcg hormone if it is above 50. There are strips, like Wondfo, that pick up when your levels are at 20.I got a positive on Wondfo 9 DPO (days past ovulation) and each day the line got darker. I had to wait until 12 DPO for first response to register that I was pregnant. And get this, the Wondfo strips are DIRT CHEAP. These are much expensive.So, BOTTOM LINE: buy cheaper and more sensitive tests by buying the thin little strips that you dip in a cup."
3,Good not great,"I enjoyed this book for the historic content but found a few of the characters less than believable and thought the book just needed ""something."" I just wanted more from it somehow. The characters that were well-done were enjoyable, however, and I did like the descriptions and the language."
5,The Deadwood Beetle,"The Deadwood Beetle is a warm, well-written book. I enjoyed the uncomplicated way in which the story was written. The book is worth reading by anyone who likes books free of flowery fillers."
5,great small group,"I concur with Joe that this is probably McCoy's finest small group.I was lucky enough to see this group in the late 70's and this CD captures perfectly the group probably at its peak. Charles Fambrough has a fat sound on the bass which adds alot. The two horns push things just enough to where the listener does not struggle to understand what they are trying to say. And McCoy's solo performance of Naima IMHO is among the finest of any solo pieces he has recorded, and worth the price of the CD itself."
5,Love love love them,"These gloves are soft, warm & comfortable, even with rings on my fingers... Since there are no seams in the fingers I can do just about anything in them including bridle & saddle my horse. I love them!"
3,Too strong? Only a dreamer?,"As shown in the title, this book has a strong message. Actually, it is too strong.The definition of strong democracy is extremely narrow and idealistic. According to the book, unbelievably, Pateman's position (about participatory (industry) democracy) is also thin democracy.It seems a book for dreamers.But, the interesting point is that the strong democracy which the author proposed may fit well with the current IT society. The final section of this book is still meaningful for us in 21th century."
4,Must Have Pocket Reference for Family Medicine Residents!,"This book has (almost) everything that a family physician needs in the hospital. I purchased the original edition a number of years ago, and recently bought the 2000 edition. I only carry two books with me in the hospital -- the Pocket Pharmacopea and this book.This book continues the trend of high quality pocket publications from the Current Clinical Strategies series. If you're a resident in family medicine, get this book and the Pharmacopea -- you'll be set.If you're a medical student, get this book, the Washington Manual (or Ferri), the Pharmacopea, and check out their H&P pocket book as well.BTW, don't waste your time with the CD-ROM version of this book -- unless you expect to lug around your laptop all day!"

3,Please Teacher,"This is a really fun series. It is full of embarassing situations and rediculous conclusions.The last few episodes get a little too sensual for younger viewers, but the rest is just great."
3,He must have listened to someone's old Joan Baez records...,"Many of these songs were performed by Joan Baez in the early 1960s, back when she still had ""...an achingly pure choir boy soprano..."" and accompanied only by her own acoustic guitar. I thought it would be interesting to hear new versions of these old chestnuts. My, my...wasn't I suprised to hear that they are, in fact, virtual covers of Joan's own vocal arrangements.My suggestion is to give her versions a hearing instead, specifically her first two studio albums, the 2 concert albums, and Joan Baez 5."
3,not my cup of tea.,"I love andreas scholl, he has a beautiful voice and he is very sexy in a delicat way..but i didnt enjoy the style of this one. very commercial.i like his harmonia mundi's ""folksongs"" album much more.this one is so girly. reminded me the ""sound of music""...yak!an advice andreas, stop being a whore of the industry make true interesting early music we the fans deserve it."
5,Beauty,"This is one of the most beautiful CDs I know: so pure in tone, so haunting in its harmonies. The reservations of some other listeners seem to make this quality a sort of fault, and perhaps it is if you like your ballads gritty; but I find the selections, the arrangements, and Scholl's singing so ravishing that I felt I had to write this review just to urge everyone to try it. Listen to ""I Will Give My Love ..."" You might feel your heart stop."
5,Wayfaring Stranger: Folksongs,This is a fantastic CD. The countertenor voice of Andreas Scholl gives an entirley newmeaning to traditional folk music. The orchestration is just enough to give a haunting sound to each selection. ' Wayfaring stranger' and 'Wild mountain thyme' are two selections that make the purchasing of the CD worth the pice.
5,Yummmmmm,"The recipe for Chocolate Raspberry Cake alone is worth the price of this book.Then there's the St. Nicholas Cake, a fruity cake for the holidays and Eggnog French Toast and Lamb Stew with Lemon and Olives. Recipes have some unusual ingredients sometimes, but you can often track them down without too much trouble.The book is beautifully organized by the seasons. You'll find fancier illustrations elsewhere, but you won't find better recipes for entertaining. Rosse and Lukins developed these recipes for their shop in New York City and each one that I've tried is a hit. So many cookbooks have mediocre recipes but you can depend on this one."
1,Skip the Kindle version of this classic,"I have loved this book from the day it was published...in print. Today, on the under $3.99 sale, I bought the Kindle version. Horrible! What makes the Silver Pallette so special are the lists down the side of the page - occasions to serve champagne, for example. The Kindle layout causes this charming book to lose all uniqueness. While it seems all the original content is here, it's presented in the most boring fashion. I would have paid more for a scanned PDF copy. Really!If you don't have this book, and you should, buy a used paperback copy for just a few dollars more than the Kindle version. So much more satisfying!"
5,"I agree, one of the best cookbooks in print.","Just for three or four of the recipes alone it's worth it, but overall the blueprints of all content for various occasions bring uncomplicated flare and quality to the kitchen. A kitchen must-have."
5,Silver palate good times,"Gives recipes by the season - Recognizes the Holidays in Calender order and gives ideas and recipes for entertaining, picnicing, and general cooking. Makes the most of what is in season at the time.Retail price on this book was $19.95 in 1985 (1st edition)!!"
2,Disappointed in recipes,"I LOVE Sarah Leah Chase's other cookbooks, but was disappointed in this one. This was was from early in her career, when I assume she had a smaller part in the content of this book... I'd recommend Nantucket Open House or Cold Weather Cooking over this book."
5,Still wonderful after all these years,I bought the book for a friend and put notes by the recipes I've used over the last 20 or so years. I realized these are still some of my favorite dishes. The sidebar notes in the book are still very useful and fun reading. I would recommend highly for a cook who doesn't already have a dog-eared (like mine) version.
3,"Haven't used it yet, but...","the ""pecan"" color is more of a ""cherry"" than the lighter color in the on-line photo. The stain on some of the pieces does not match, some are much noticably darker than others. Also, we received a ""#-in-one"", not a ""4-in-one"". Took a leisurely hour to put together."
1,Ripped-off,"Do not buy this product!! The others complain about the productbeing defective once it is assembled.But the situation is muchworse than that. Amazon.com does not even send you the assemblyinstructions that go with this product. When I called amazon.comall I got was a phone number for Schwinn and an email telling methat past giving me a phone number, I was pretty much on my own.When you call Schwinn, you will get a run around.Not receiving assembly instructions is pretty much a consistenttheme with this product. So please don't think you will be treated better.This is dreadfully irresponsible on the part of Amazon.com.The company is a tier 1 vendor and can easily use its leverage withSchwinn to make sure that a persistent complaint is fixed. But theyprefer to be callous about it, give you a number and kiss you off.Till this situation is rectified I, for my part, would stronglyadvise not buying this product anymore, at least from this website.If you do, prepare to be disappointed."
2,"Great idea, poor quality","I'm sad that this really neat concept of a bike is poorly constructed. We got it and set it up (not the easiest set up--it took several hours) and found that it was making a terrible noise and leaving rubber shavings all over. Turns out that the rubber chain driver rubs against the metal. It was sort of one thing after another. If you get this DO NOT order it via the web. Go to a local store, check it out, and be sure they will deliver it and set it up to your satisfaction. I wish someone would have told me this."
3,Schwinn Airdyne Evo Comp Exercise Bike,"I received my Schwinn Airdyne Evo Comp Exercise Bike promptly by two day prime shipment. A Fed Ex driver delivered it a long distance through deep snow by hand truck. When ordering,I did not receive the extra $100.00 off at check-out, but this was remedied by a brief email. When I opened the carton, I was impressed by the quality of the product. Based upon other reviews I expected the assembly instructions to be very poor. What I did not expect was the complete lack of any instructions. On February 10, 2010, I emailed Amazon and Schwinn about the problem and requested instructions. Today is February 18, 2010, I have not heard a word from either company. As a customer who has spent many thousands of dollars with Amazon over the last several years, I am very unhappy. I will thing twice before ordering again"
5,Schwinn Airdyne Evo Comp Exercise Bike,"Ok, I was expecting the worst and hoping for the best for the assembly. The best was it. Assemble was easy. I downloaded the online manual and use the manual they gave me. Using both manual made it a lot easier. I do agree the manual that came with the bike wasn't that good. The only problem I had was screwing the electronic to the frame. I don't know if i did it correctly but I just screw 2 long one into a plastic hole which worked for me. The bike I know will be good since I have used the older ones and I was just worried that I would get missing parts etc.. but I'm one of the lucky ones and the bike came with everything."
4,"Excellent product, poor asembly instructions","This is an excellent exercise bike. I got it for my wife who used it during therapy after knee surgery. I had it shipped from Amazon and it arrived quickly. The only problem so far was the poor assembly instructions. Luckily I had read your other reveiws and was somewhat prepared for this (metric tools). It was still difficult mainly because of the poor graphics. Also, the cage had slipped and was rubbing on the belt which I didn't figure out right away. They should have warned about this. Anyway, it is put together and works fine."
1,Poor Quality Product - DO NOT BUY IT,"I recently purchased a Schwinn Airdyne Eco Comp Exercise Bike and was APALLLED at the quality of the documentation and assembly of this product. I had read previous reviews of poor quality before purchasing this product and assumed they would have been fixed (reviews were basically 2 years old). After many hours and additional expense i was able to hire someone to get the bike working properly - involved disassembly, cutting metal, finding/replacing missing parts, etc. etc.... I know i should have immediately sent it back, but shipping containers were gone, and 1 problem kept leading to another. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK !"
1,What a pain,"Purchased the Schwinn Airdyne Evo and it was delivered promptly. Unfortunately the assembly instructions are terrible. The parts list has multiple similar parts and their are no pictures of the parts to know which is which. The assembly pictures are small and poorly done. The written instructions assume that you assemble products on a daily basis, know a 5 mm bolt from a 6 mm bolt, know what a locking washer is, etc. I am returning the product as a matter of principle. Don't buy this unless you work at a bicycle shop or as a car mechanic. Spend the extra $100 bucks and buy from a local vendor who will assemble."
1,Absolute POS,"Don't buy this bike. The Airdyne was recommended to me by a friend, and boy was that a mistake. The instructions for assembly are a joke, and it will take a good 2-3 hours even if you are fast at putting stuff together.Once I got it together, then of course, the computer display didn't work (exercise timer would abrubtly freeze). Called Schwinn, and they sent another (that still didn't work). I am sending this thing back.Cross this one off of your list!"
1,one works one doesn't,"Purchased two of these bikes. arrived on time but different days. One works great. The other however does not. Even after adjusting the wheel tension, the tension is so high you can not get the pedels to move. Dont know what to do with it now!!"
2,Good when not broken,"Very upset with the purchase of our bikes, WE have ordered 3 in less than a year for our gym and on one back has already cost us $100 to repair, A part inside that holds the chain on the bike keeps breaking causing the chain to fall off. For what you spend on these bikes I am very disappointed in the make of them."
3,"Poor instructions, good bike","As mentioned earlier the instructions could be clearer. Find the comment in this thread and follow those if you have trouble. The bike comes mostly assembled, you just need to attach the base stabilizeds, and metal arms that connect the pedals to the arm handles. Put the seat, and pedals on and you are almost done. Most of it was striaght forward, but the pedals are threaded in opposite directions. The included computer module was a pain. The brackets looked like last minute add ons, and they didnt fit the grooves in the computer housing properly."
5,Very good bike,"A very well made bike,great way to keep fit. Great pedal range and power.Great upper body work out.You can rest your legs and just use the upper body work out or all at the same time.If it is snowy or a heat wave out side i can get a super work out.I had a back problem and leg/hip injury from hockey and this bike is very easy to use with no stress on my back or hip.Not at all a cheep machine but very worth it."
3,Good but not great,"I was told Airdyne exersize bikes are the way to go for general areobic fitness and endurance without the impact of running. After using mine, I agree but I feel the assembly quality is lack luster. I've had belt issues from day one, but the manufacturer has been easy to work with to resolve my problems. I have a Polar heart rate monitor, and the bike has a heart rate receiver, but it doesn't seem to be accurate. After a workout the bike computer claims my average heart rate is almost 20bpm higher than my wrist receiver.If you are looking for a fancy machine that can provide various workout patterns, this is not the one. It is a barebones piece of exercise equipment. If you are self-motivated and able to stick to an exercise program, it provides a great workout.Would I purchase an Airdyne again? Yes, but I would probably choose the original based on the belt issues I've had and the low quality worksmanship of my unit."
3,Maybe the worst instructions on the planet,"I bought this bike after using one at the rehab facility after a knee replacement. Although it the same model number, there are several minor differences and it is not as smooth. Still a nice bike for the money although a pain to assemble. We thought this product had the worst assembly instructions ever. I have ordered car parts from Japan off ebay that only came with Japanese instructions. Even without speaking Japanese, those instructions were easier to follow than the junk that came with this airdyne. I probably would have given it 4 stars otherwise."
5,I highly recommend the Aidyne Evo Comp for your home workout routine!,I recently acquired this bike from a friend. I had wanted one since I saw it used on the sidelines of an NFL game. What a great bike! The construction is great. And the bike rides really smooth. I like being able to exercise my upper and lower body at the same time. A great work out. I highly recommend this bike if you can afford the price.
2,The mouse is Mickey Mouse.,"Right out of the box, the factory mouse would not work, no matter what I did. So, I tried a Microsoft Intelimouse; that didn't work either. Then, I tried a Logitec cordless mouse, which worked! I then attempted a drive image of the C drive. I tried to use Memorex CD-RW media, but that didn't work. I then tried CompUSA CD-RW media of the same specifications, and that did work. I hate to think where I would be if I hadn't tried these fixes. This is not inspiring for a brand new computer. My only consolation is that the computer was dirt cheap for what appears to be good features. Nothing else appears to be wrong with it, so far. If you buy it, I hope you have better luck than I did."
5,As advertised,"great product. I love that I can buy a multi-pack on Amazon, and not have to get it at the store. Amazon offers privacy from bumping into acquaintances that I wouldn't want to tell we're TTC."
1,Go for the gold (digital),"If you're using these tests, especially before having IUI or IVF, you're at the point where a clear response is exactly what you want. The nerve-wracking experience of interpreting the subtle differences in the colors of the lines is something I could've done without. This morning, I thought had a positive result, but wasn't 100% sure, since the test is so subtle. Thankfully, I had one remaining Clear Blue digital test on hand and was able to verify the result. Spring the few extra bucks for clarity. It's worth it!"
1,Not sensitive in the least,"I bought two boxes of this product and freaked out and thought I was not ovulating because I used them as directed and they did not pick up my LH. On the days I was ovulating, the tests showed a very faint faint line...which means Negative. I went to a fertility endocrinologist and had testing done and it turns out I'm FINE! No problems with LH or anything else. Ordered tests in just the plain strips from Amazon. They are called Babi. My Dr. reccomended the plain strip with no casing (like the 7 day first response for instance). Don't buy this. Waste of time and money."
1,These do NOT work!,I have never written a review for anything but I hated these soooooooo much that I felt it was imperative I review them. I have always used the Clear Blue Easy Digital ones or the cheap little strips but the store I went to was out of Clear Blue Easy so I grabbed a box of these First Response ones. I have never gotten a positive but know based on my cervical mucus and basal body temperature that I did ovulate. So now I'm super upset because my husband and I missed an opportunity to get pregnant this cycle since I didn't know until after I ovulated that I had done so (BBT doesn't tell you until after you have) since these tests didn't work. Don't waste your money...buy the Clear Blue Easy Digital ones!!!
1,Do not buy!!,"Do not purchase this item. After you detect your LH surge the machine automatically shuts off! What a waste of money! The sticks are not even individually wrapped, and they expire 30 days after the pouch is opened. If you ovulate early, like my cousin does on day 6 or 7, youve wasted your money. The Clearblue ones are much better! I used them with my first child and they worked the first month. Unless you get pregnant the first month these area complete waste of money!"
2,Almost at expiration date,"The product arrived in a timely matter and was what was described, however, the product was nearing it's expiration date and for a test that can be very sensitive, I was expecting a newer product. To give an idea on age of product, it had a coupon that expired in 2010 and I received the product at the end of 2012,"
1,nothing,I could guess the ovulation or pms suposed date by how i felt. I followed the dirrected and got the exact result midway and the days right before my period.
3,If you have regular periods...,"If one has regular cycles, I'm sure this product could work well. If one has irregular periods like myself, it won't work very well for you. I read in ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"" that some women's LH surge only lasts up to 12 hours so if you only use these tests once a day, you'll miss your hormone surge. After using this product and another brand for two week straight with all negatives, I became very discouraged. I was recently diagnosed with PCOS (poly-cystic ovary syndrome) which is a leading cause of irregular periods. Please ladies, if you have irregular periods, see an endocrinologist or a fertility specialist asap!"
2,First Response,This product has very difficult instructions that to me don't make alot of sense. I wasted my money.
4,Worked well for me and I have irregular cycles,"My husband and I have been off of birth control for almost a year now. I have had pretty irregular cycles since going off of the pill. I had tried the OPK with the little smiley face and never did get a positive result. I may have started using it too early, which is obviously a user error, but I felt that with the first response brand I was able to compare the lines instead of a smiley doing the work for me. After temping for a few months I was more easily able to figure out when to use the OPK and finally got a positive test. The lines for me were easy to distinguish (and I was very happy to get any kind of positive result). Buying the tests on Amazon was more cost effective than at the drugstore and I did receive them in a timely manner. The only thing that I am not able to add to this review is whether or not they worked. I am still waiting to find out. So if you read this review, please keep your fingers crossed for me."
3,ovulation kit,I found that the lines were hard to read. It was hard to determine if one line was lighter than the other one. Each time i used them the lines looked the same. The price was really good and it came with a free pregnancy test.
1,These dont work!,"These tests completely dont work. If you have never used ovulation tests before you may think they do because you will get a lot of random positives but if you have used other brands you will find out just how inaccurate these are. I have used 4 boxes total and the results are completely inaccurate. One day will be positive, one day negative, one day positive and so forth. It doesnt matter when in my cycle I use them. Well this cycle I took the first response ovulation test along with the clear blue easy digital and a generic test strip ovulation test and the first response test was very negative but the digital ovulation test and the test strip were both positive. So the First Response ovulation tests will basically tell you nothing dont waste your money and be misled about when your LH surge is."
2,Extremely basic - for the very beginner,"I have reviewed many real estate books and this is a very very basic book for beginners of residential real estate math. The book starts with adding and subtracting. There is no section on the finance behind income producing properties such as determing cap rates, cash flows, etc. Even for beginners, this book is extremely basic with basic math formulas. You would need a supplemental book with more advanced concepts. If you have no math background, then this is a good book but if you know some math, I would recommend a more advanced book."
5,Mastering Real Estate Mathematics,Mastering Real Estate Mathematics is a very good book. I purchased a used copy for my girlfriend who is mathematically challenged to say the least (as she will readily admit). She used this book as a tool to pass her state real estate licensing exam and will use it again for her state broker exam in 24 months. Get a copy if you need help with real estate math.
5,Get that book and STUDY it !,"Mastering Real Estate Mathematics is really M A S T E R I N G the subject.It consists of Five following Parts :Part I : Parts and Pieces of the TotalPart II : Surface and SpacePart III : Economics of Real EstatePart IV : Doing the BusinessPart V : Practice Makes PerfectAll these 5 Parts are preceded by a Preface and an Introduction that tells you how to go about Studying the book.Part I includes the following chapters :1.

Lease CalculationsPart V includes the following chapter :Practice makes perfectA Glossary completes it."
3,Real Estate = Investing= Financial Acumen,"Any investment requires analysis.Real estate is no different.Real estate investing looks at cash flow, and yields and return on investment.This stuff is not hard. Even if you are a math phobic person-- you can do this.Really-- its just plugging numbers into a calculator these days.What you need to know is what that answer means.... from an investment perspective. This book helps you get there.Take the first step.I own it. I like it."
2,Mastering Real Estate Math,Some what out of date material but helpful for basic math questions . The CMA section had really out of date examples and problems.
1,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I Hate !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This doll is SO EXTREMELY HIDEOUS! She has ""fure"" lining her coat (blah). She is wearing ""snakeskin"" boots (ew). This toy is an insult to the enviorment. How could MGA even think about thinking of making this doll. Yes, I know that Bratz are made to to play with and all that, and I'm a Bratz fan. But this... this just disgustes me! Disgusts me! It gives off a message that it is ""cool"" to kill animals and wear them. Bratz are cool, but to make them wear fur, even if it's fake, is just plain wrong. I mean, what if they made a Brat doll that was wearing human skin or hair, like if they made a Bratz Aztec line. Soooooooo many people would object. But when it is animal hide, oh no, they say : how cute, nice make-up, ect. But anyone who actully likes this doll is sick. Besides, her face looks like a baby's."
1,Don't do it!!!,The price on these was to good to be true.....you might think that these would be just as good as the more expensive ones! THEY ARE NOT!!! they lasted about 3 weeks before they started cutting out.
3,Good goings,"3 1/2Usually straddling the line between pretty and boring, one cannot fault the earnest experimental techno-pop from this one man show for offering something pleasantly off-beat for younger listeners."
4,Simple and usefull,"It does it's job, it holds a bottle. whether its a sports bottle, or a gatorade bottle. Your bike should have 2 screws already in the frame to attach this. you can't beat this for the price."
1,Too Cheap,Metal fatigued with in a week and it broke off. I bought these as extra'a but regret the purchase now. Plastic ones would have been better. Leasson learned.
3,It's really tight,"The bottle cage is really tight. It holds my water bottle with a death grip. When I pulled my water bottle out, the red paint will stain my bottle."
5,Keeps the bottle on the bike,Keeps the bottle on the bike. It's pretty and yellow. The price was right. It fit. What more do you want?
4,Kim English...Missing You,"Kim English has been doing the circuit for awhile and has only recently been seeing the recognition that this she so richly deserves. Previous singles ""Tomorrow"" and ""Learn 2 Luv"" were great but lacked the right remixes. Of course ""Unspeakable Joy"" struck gold for her as we all know...and was even voted the most overplayed club song of 1999 by NYC DJ Victor Calderone. She strikes again with ""Missing You."" This single is a rousing house anthem, clocking in at more than 11 minutes. The bass line is pounding, and the synths break at all the right points. But more than just a great dance song, this song has haunting lyrics that will hit home with anyone that has ever lost a loved one. One drawback to the single is that there is no radio edit (for those times when 11 minutes is just too long) and there are no other mixes than the Mind Trap mixes. Overall, well worth it."
4,Great masking fluid!,I always use Winsor Newton making products. They work well & remove easily without damaging your paper. I would recomend this product.
3,careful of expectations...,"Pires is a superb pianist, and I am a huge fan of virtually every recording she has produced...until this one. Mind you, this is not a ""bad"" recording. Rather, it just did not move me the way that nearly all of her other recordings have. By way of example, I think her recordings of the Schubert Impromptus are the kind one would wish to have on that proverbial desert isle.One other complaint is against the experimental packaging. It was exceptionally flimsy. One must hope that we are not viewing the future of CD packaging."
4,Tad bit flimsy,"These baskets are very cute, however, a tad bit flimsy. Babies 'R Us sells some that are MUCH sturdier and I would recommend those over these. However, these are still a great price at [...] and will be put to good use in your nursery storing diapers, toys, etc. for baby."
4,"Flimsy, but Fits","These baskets are a bit flimsy, and the fabric is a little loose over the frame. But the color is cute (the sage looks the same shade on the computer as it does in person), and it fits theSouth Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White. Once the baskets are inside the cubbies of the changing table, the flimsiness doesn't really matter, and it serves its purpose. (The basket doesn't extend all the to the back of each cubby, though)."
4,Review,The only negative I would say is that I paid for expedited shipping and it was not sent that way. The product is excellent.
5,"Romantic, Peaceful, Great Jazz","This album has been my all-time favorite for many, many years. I was so happy to find it as a CD, so I can keep enjoying it for years to come. In my opinion, it's Stanley Turrentine at his best!"
5,a MUST HAVE for any child/parent,"this 2 cd set ( make sure you get a 2 cd set that is made in CANADA) that is where the group is from, and that is where their original recodrings live. original import 2 CD set gives you endless hours of songs that you can sing with your child, or he/she can have fun alone. the songs just ""draw you in"". We have a large collection of kids music - over 200, ans Sharon, Lois and Bram Cds are by far THE BEST. Next best is another Artist from CANADA - Fred Penner.buy these and ENJOY!!"
4,great watch,"i chose this watch out of 2 other fossil watches because i thought it had a very sheen tint of pink, however the dial is a much darker pink shade than shown in the picture, but it's not ugly. Also it seems that the glass is flat but it is slightly raised and jewel shaped. the time hands and the hour markers glow in the dark and the watch also displays the date which is a nice extra. i've always liked fossil watches and this one is no exception"
2,Not As Good As Its Reputation,"I had heard much about the Sayings, but after actually reading them, I can only say they left me quite unimpressed. There is very little in the book besides exhortations to be steady, sincere and to obey one's parents and tradition. Nothing at all is said about any sort of internal transformation as one finds in Lao-Tze. I can't read Chinese, so I can't say how accurate the translation is, but if this is what Confucius was all about I just don't see what all the fuss is about."
5,stainless mixing bowls,These stainless mixing bowls are the perfect solution to the bowls that I broke. They came quickly and are better than I hoped for!
2,Should have read reviews for the small bowl,"I should have read the reviews for the small bowl (only) and would have found out that these do not fit every Mixmaster. They will not seat completely on my machine. Another thing, I'm questioning the quality of this stainless steel and whether I'm even going to use these. My husband scrubbed these several times as he said there was ""black stuff"" on the outside and I have run them through the dishwasher twice and they are still dingy looking. I'm wishing I would have just replaced my missing (large) bowl with a glass one. Too late to send them back now, I've since recycled the box and not up to dealing with a return."
4,Mixing Bowls,Was very happy with both of these mixing bowls when I received them. Had broken my big glass bowl and had never reordered until I saw them on the web site. My small bowl is still okay but went ahead and bought the replacement set in case they ever went off the market and I wouldn't be able to get a small one. Their web site was the cheapest ones I located and was happy to get them.
1,Terrible quality,These 2 bowls came in bent and the seam on the large bowl was seperating. They also had a bunch of oily stains that appeared after we tried washing the bowls.Quality was so bad I returned them. Not sure why I had to pay for return shipping when they were so defective.
1,wrong fit,"The stainless steel bowls ordered do not fit the mixer. When attempting to run the mixer, the bowls do not rotate. My Oster mixer is old, but I believe mixer bowls exist that will fit and work as intended."
5,Extremely Helpful,This book helped me (and 4 friends I let borrow it) land a good job coming out of college. Highly recommended.
4,"Alternative to ""What to Expect""","I have been an OB nurse for over 30 years and I feel that ""While Waiting"" is one of the best books out there for expectant parents. It has practical, easy to read advice. There is a great section on nutrution that uses things that you can find in your own kitchen - not at a health food store.This book is given to every new mom in the OB office where I work and at every childbirth education class I teach. It would also make a perfect extra gift for a shower."
4,"short and helpful, good section on symptoms","I found myself referring back to this one a lot, it has a very easy to find and read section on symptoms and bodily changes--what to expect when and what to do about it. I liked the drawings of how big the baby is for my older kids, too. Not very in depth, though."
1,Outrageous,"I found this book to very condescending, it gives the impression that women know nothing of their bodies and need to blindly follow anything an ob tells them. Inaccurate information about common medical interventions and the necessity of C-sections are also rampant in this book. After reading the labor and delivery section I was outraged by the author's apparent belief that a new mother does not have any choices in what routine medical procedures are done to their babies. New parents need to know that THEY are in charge of what is done to/with their babies!!!"
5,This box is PART ONE of TWO - READ ON,"Okay, for all those out there that are dissapointed that the story ended so abruptly with Episode 12, this is only the first half of the story...The second half of the story is released as the series called ""CANDIDATE FOR GODDESS"" Episodes 1 thru 12, followed by an OVA also called ""CANDIDATE FOR GODDESS"".So, to see the entire series, first watch PILOT CANDIDATE, and then get CANDIDATE FOR GODDESS and finally the OVA.There you have it!"
3,Not too bad.,"Pilot Candidate overall was a very well done series. One of the better animes I've watched, and one of my personal favorites. The only problem with the show was its ending; it left off as if the series was ditched due to being cancelled or money problems, or something of that nature; the last episode leaves you hanging, and thirsting for more. However, other than the anticlimatic end, Pilot Candidate was well put together, with wonderful CG for its time. It was also very fun to watch, and I personally enjoyed every minute, right up to the lackluster end. I give it three stars only for the ending, otherwise it would be five. Anyone who is a fan of any anime should at least give this a rental try, if not a buy. For the price, this was an excellent bargain. So, as you can see from my above review, i definitely reccomend you see it."
3,disappointed,The animation was great but the storyline was a little confusing and the ending was not clear. I was hoping it would have more story to tell.
3,"Great Series, But not a Complete Colection",This was a great FIRST SEASON collection. There are actually more episodes. My guess is they have not had a USA release yet.After all I have episodes 13-17 in Japanese only Audio with Fan SubTitles.So if you like Mech/Space type Anime I think you will like this.
4,"Good, solid boat hose","The only real issue with this hose is that it is not really a functional 25' long. While that may be the case if you unnaturally stretch it almost to the breaking point, you otherwise may get only 15' to 20' of normal use. In all other respects, it is well built and as described."
5,Good choice,"I found this book good and useful especially the author provided section summaries in each chapter. This helped me to understand easily. There are chapter summaries at the end of each chapter too. Review questions are also provided for each chapter. This arrangement is good for readers.For those who is preparing CCNA exam, this is a good choice to begin with."
5,CCNA Self study,It is simply a good buy! If you are looking for self study CCNA books then this the one.
4,Use as a mold,This is a very nice item to have as a holiday tradition. I suggest using the pan as a mold and bake the pieces on a cookie sheet. That way you don't have to bake three times. It works great that way and then if you want one or two extra pieces for an extra wall etc. you have that freedom.
5,Great mold!,We were sick of buying those cheap $6 kits that were stale before you got them. We bought this gingerbread house mold and made our own house. The decorated house was a (requested) gift for a six-year-old boy. He LOVED IT! And the best part...we can make our own whenever we want to. LOVE THIS MOLD!
5,CHRISTMAS GIFT,Item arrived just as promised and was in excellent condition. This was a gift so I have not used it but it did meet my expectations.NordicWare German Gingerbread House Mold
1,Not reliable at all,Eats batteries and stopped working altogether after only a couple months ... would never buy again.
2,standard operation,I bought this camera for my grandson.I am very dissapointed in how this camera works. When you turn the camera on the flash is automatically off. You then have to select the flash on each time the camera is turned on.Also you can not review the pictures taken in the camera lcd screen.You have to upload them to the computer.This is suppose to be a point and shot camera.I would not buy this camera again.
5,Fast Acting,"I found these tablets to be extremely fast acting, and well worth the money. The taste leaves much to be desired; they're vitamins, not candy so it's easy to get over the flavor."
1,"bitter, bitter, bitter","This is not only huge (as the previous reviewer noted) it could only be considered ""orange flavored"" if by orange you mean the bitter part of the rind!! It is unpalatable. I hope it works swallowed ..."
3,Potential,"October Fall has a polished emo/pop sound, somewhere between Click Five and the Back Street Boys. When their stuff works, it works well. The best cut here is probably ""Caught in the Rain,"" a high-energy blaster reminiscent of John Eddie's ""Jungle Boy"" and Fall Out Boy's ""Sugar We're Goin Down"" (the latter being one of the best single tracks of the past five years). Also good are ""Keep Dreaming Upside Down"" and ""Walking."" Most of the other cuts fall short of the mark. ""Tongue Tied"" for example starts off with the intent of an old-fashioned pop ballad but does not live up to the wonderful piano intro. All in all, a band with lots of potential, with seemingly good songwriting skills. Hopefully they will steer away from emo and more toward power pop, where they seem to have the most promise."
5,The most interesting book I've read in a long time..,"I loved this book, could not put it down, this author keeps you intrigued through the entire book...I didn't want it to end. I'm recomending this book to anyone who has an interest in mystery and detective stories, Hugh Holton will most definetly keep you on the end of your seat. Just ordered Violent Crimes and can't wait to read that, I will be reading this authors enitire collection"
5,Great Afro/Euro Sound,"Despite what another reviewer wrote I am pleased this did not include ""township beats"", if I wanted to hear people rapping tsotsi to the beats being banged out on pots and pans with forks I would have bought a mediocre tribal release. This CD is actually pretty low key/ loungy cool....just like Cape Town is. It is a cool mixture of funk, house, disco, and Euro electronica. South Africa is a mixture of people and this CD reflects that. This CD is great chill out and pretty reflective of the Cape Town scene--chilled, cool, beautiful, a little funky, and relaxed. The CD is marketed to the South African well heeled, modern, jet set crowd....... If you want cool multicultural lounge music get this CD....if you want bush (township)music contact National Geographic."
3,What Happened?,Disappointed... I was hoping to hear some degree of the Township beats mixed in. Nada... this is as Euro sounding and stale as it gets. In the past the Afterdark series did an excellent job of capturing the host city's influence... they missed the mark on this release.
4,Halwinhar,"This DVD was very good. I enjoyed the songs and seeing the living legend quartets. The history about each group was also informative. I would recommend this item to lovers of gospel music, especially 'down-home gospel'."
2,REV. J'S REVIEW,LIVING LEGENDS 1 WAS A BIT OF A DISAPOINTMENT. THE SET WAS LACKING AND EVEN THE GROUPS SEEMED BORED WHEN THEY WHERE NOT SINGING.
5,Authentic sound plus brimming energy,Forquerays harpsichord works intrigues me since I heard it for the first time.an album of complete work with satisfactory playing has now come into my musical library.thanks Mr Rousset For I feel as if I have own all of Forqueray on my CD
3,"disappointed, I really expected more from a German knife company","I ordered this knife because I needed a carbon steel pocket knife. If you've ever searched for one they are not easily found these days. First thing I noticed is the size it is smaller than other Medium stockman knives I have. Next the blades were poorly sharpened, the tips of the blades aren't sharp they are rounded off. Lastly the blades are crooked when the knife is folded. I just expected more, I hope they at least used good steel to make it."
2,Not What I Wanted.,"What I wanted was the music IN the movie. That is, the music you are aware of when watching the movie: the eventful music. Such as:1- the wonderful stage performance of the girl who converted a refrigerator into her bathtub. The singing and the music is really strong, and also funny.2- the ""Hi, Dad, I'm in JAIL !"" song, that the jerk painter was listening to in the studio.3- the Supreme's song, sung by the 'girls' in red on the street while the couple was arguing in the studio. (Maybe there are copyright problems with this.)4- the wonderful live drum band at the second party scene, with the woman singer, holding the trumpet.None of this is on the 'soundtrack' CD.What they gave us is the music BEHIND the movie. I have done feature film sound work. The music they gave us is the music that you are not supposed to notice: the background music. So I'm disappointed. I don't want even one of these songs. d. c."
5,Touching and heartbreaking,"Sammy's story will embrace the readers heart and bring tears to their eyes. Throughout the story Sammy searches for love, peace and respect in all the wrong places. If one truly has a heart they will find theirs moving with sadness and compassion for Sammy. She is served with much more than her share of heartache. At points in this book I could feel Sammy's pain as if it were my own. It made me want to find her and give her a hug, urging her to hang in there and never give up."
3,Is there a warranty on the serving tray?,"I purchased it on 5/21. It was very nice. I took beautiful food pictures with it. Today, 6/23, I noticed there was a crack in the middle. Not sure if it was there when it was delivered. I am curious as if there is a warranty on the product. Thanks!"
2,Cracked Tray,Ordered two trays but one came with a crack in the middle. I will be putting vinyl on both so not too big of a deal.
4,High Quality,Nice quality. Cleans up well and the color goes pretty deep so the dings do not show up that much.
2,Top Heavy,"BUILT! MORE by Bruno Gmunder and Ron Lloyd seeks to celebrate the hard beauty of the athletic and muscular male physique. While the cover photo certainly enticed me to purchase the book, I must admit to being somewhat disappointed by the pages between the covers. Unlike the beef on the cover, too many of the models lacked balance (over developed chests and arms and underdeveloped legs and abs). Moreover, many of these muscular men had that arificial ""steroid look"" that seems to celebrate pharmacology over genuine masculinity."
3,Not the old Jimmy Thackery,"It's become evident over the last couple albums that Jimmy wants to take his music in other directions.On this album, he's added on a full horn section. Something you never heard in earlier albums like 'Empty Arms Motel' or Trouble Man'. Even though he's still got his great songwriting skills, I feel like his guitar is starting to take a back seat to the arrangments. As a person who owns all of Jimmy's albums, I miss that unique trademark echo-laden guitar sound that spoiled me on his earlier albums. I'm giving this one 3 stars, but keep in mind that a 3 star Jimmy Thackery is better than 90% of all the other bluz-rock out there."
2,My hero has let me down!,"As a longtime Jimmy fan,I was truly disappointed in his latest release. He once was quoted as saying the bigger record labels always over-produce the music and ""take the nuts out"". Well he seems to have done just that himself! I think he is the greatest guitar slinger active today, (SRV was good, but just a hack next to Jimmy) but there are no classics on this disc. If I were to compose a ""best of"" CD (I have) maybe ""Chained to the Blues Line"" would be on it.No ""Rub on Up's"" on this one. And the sax! Play the guitar! I look forward to his next release,maybe he can put the nuts back in. See you at The Cabooze on Dec. 1st."
5,Thoroughly Enjoyed This Diving Thriller . . . .,"This is great summer read. The commercial diver hero, Ben Gannon, gets tangled up with Indonesian pirates, crime lords, and tiger-poaching mercenaries over in the Java Sea. Hot action and some really twisted characters keep the surprises popping up, and there are some very well-drawn technical diving scenes. The female lead, Gannon's girl Sass, is very appealing: sexy and down-to-earth. And author McKinna has a really entertaining writing style--his ""turn of phrase"" is often funny in a dry sort of way. And he keeps things moving fast. Fun to read, loads of thrills and laughs. Nothing not to like in this book, the second in a series that started last summer with Crash Dive, which was also very good. Highly recommended."
2,Tiger Reef an okay read,"""Tiger Reef"" is an okay read from the standpoint of adventure books, but I found the characters relatively shallow (no pun intended) and the ending to be predictable. At times it has the feel of a cheap movie. At other times it has a genuine urgency of adventure."
3,Very little diving and 2 dimensional characters....,"Being a diver myself, I was looking for a good diving novel, this isn't one. The Hero is too perfect, very 2 dimensional as are all the characters... either very good or very evil and I found it difficult at times to even remember who was who. The plot is good and enjoyable but the 90% of storyline doesn't deal with the diving. Not a book I would recommend."
3,I struggle with this album...,"Because we all adore the canon of Rick's comedy work on the small and big screen, this is something altogether different. We, as fans, come to expect the same humor and delivery from our comedians, and so I look for some sort of linear progression, from SCTV to Little Shop to Spaceballs to his NYTimes pieces, etc....But Agoraphobic Cowboy is a big departure. It's still funny, but the music is well....cowboy monotonous. I find the lyrics, as 'amateur cowboy poetry with a strong streak for sarcastic wit' pleasing, but the melodies and instrumentation to rake on my nerves. If you've heard three songs, you've heard them all, and then it' time to just read the lyrics booklet for the remainder of the album.Rick, help us out! Where'a fan to go to figure you out??"
2,Shriek of the Sasquatch,"This movie was basically good for a laugh. The ""sasquatch"" definitely had no ""real"" quality at all. His appearance was that of a ""man in a suit"". Very fake. I would not recommend buying this movie."
5,An Easy to Understand SNMP Book,"Dr. Sidnie Feit's SNMP: A Guide to Network Management has been my bible in creating a SNMP program from scratch. Feit brings you step by step through what SNMP is, how it works, encoding, packet creation, and common MIBs. This SNMP book did not put me to sleep like some others I have read..."
3,not my favorite book,"I used this book while implementing an SNMP client from scratch. Although the book contained pretty much all the information I needed, I never considered it to be easy to use or particularly helpful. Perhaps if I *already* was familiar with SNMP it might have been an acceptable reference. Don't expect any programming help. This book just talks about the spec. An infuriating amount of background info where you don't need it, and not enough detail where you want it. This book is also long on SNMP jargon and short on orienting material to help you demystify the jargon. Maybe I was just in a bad mood when I was reading it."
3,Not his best,"After the excellent 'Last Train to Lhasa' and 'Maya', Banco da Gaya looses strength and breadth and at times comes across as pastiche Pink Floyd (which they themselves are more than capable of). Get his previous work but don't assume that this album will move you to the same degree."
4,you will be surprised,"the first time I listened to this, I didn't know what to think, but his voice is so beautiful and the effect is very haunting. I guess this is euro pop music, (Jay Jay is from Sweden), but I really like this. ""Neon Lights"" is my favorite."
5,Read it to enter another world,"My teacher Jo Willis read this to us in third grade. I was an Amerasian in a school for children of American Military on an American Army Base in Korea. This was my first introduction to the word Amerasian to describe what I was. It explained many things to me that I had wondered about growing up in Korea. It is also very realistic and true to the Amerasian experience as I saw and experienced it. I loved and continue to love this book and was delighted to be able to find a copy of my own. Some books transcend their title, content and provide something much more to the reader. For her documentation of the Amerasian experience, I will be forever in her debt. To read it is to enter the life of Amerasian children in Korea following the Korean War and also explains why so many children were available for adoption to the United States. This is a treasure of a book that I would recommend to adults as well as children."
3,Ok,"The story is about Matthew, a little boy whose father was an American soldier and whose mother was Korean. One day his mother abandons him and Matthew is left in Pusan to fend for himself. The story shows how interracial children in Korea faced a lot of discrimination. I was unaware of this issue. Kids interested in history and other lands may like this book. I myself am a bit lukewarm to the book-I thought the ending was too saccharine."
3,Kashkashian needs a more interesting accompanist,"As in her recording for ECM of the Bartok Viola Concerto, Kim Kashkashian works wonders here. She plays with exquisite technique and expression. She is extremely well-recorded. Unfortunately she has an albatross around her neck in the form of Robert Levin. He is as dull and colorless as accompanists come, and his uninspired, perfunctory playing mars this entire release. One wonders what a more sensitive pianist might have brough to these works, but as it is, Levin is always in the background, playing each phrase dutifully and blandly. Worth owning if you love good viola playing (and if you're disappointed with the dearth of Viola recordings out there) but not if you love good *chamber music.*"
1,Avoid Like the Plague,"Kashkashian isn't the problem here; the heavy-handed, thoroughly wrong headed and unsubtle Levin is. He pounds away on the piano, the proverbial bull in a china shop.So unless you prefer the sledge hammer approach to late Brahms, Bashmet/Muntian on RCA is far, far superior. Imai/Vignolles on Chandos is a worthy alternative, as well."
5,Lime in good form.,"Their sound is as solid as ever. As seen in ""Brand new day and Closer to you"". ""Sentimentally yours"" was a nice find but ""Please say you will"" an out of the box hit. This collection adds to the ever growing list of great hits from this great energy dance duo."
2,A Premature Claim,"William Hansen tells his heartfelt story, but the conclusion remains unwritten. Since he declares that he's taking Sinemet, which is standard PD therapy, the claim of ""conquering"" Parkinson's seems empty. And, since he hasn't been on Sinemet for more than five years, he hasn't entered the period in which the on-off cycle common to dopamine replacing protocols becomes problematic. Regarding his nutritional sprays, if they would enable him to be symptom free or even symptom reduced without Sinemet, he'd be onto something."
1,Read this book if you enjoy infomercials.,"As someone whose spouse has Parkinson's, I am always heartened and inspired by news of those who can ""beat"" the disease. I wish the author well, but the ""book"" he has written is little more than an ""infomercial"" for the sprays sold by his company. Buyer beware. . . . He offers virtually no scientific evidence to support these claims."
3,Alright,I wanted to try yoga and thought that this would be a good place to start. All and all it was alright
5,Great!,"The YOGA exercises are pretty intense, while the pilates videos are easier. It was a great bought for a really good price."
1,VERY disappointed,"They talk about parts/muscle groups one has never heard from. I've gone through all 4 DVDs.A waste of money! If you have already taken theses classes to know what they are talking about, you are in the dark.If you took a beginner class which teaches what all the terms are, then get this. If you are unable to afford those VERY expensive classes, you will be watching it and feel like you're in a Calculus class.I'm now stuck with this set. Not happy. I went back to the old fashioned gym in the apt building.These are for the ADVANCED persons who've already taken the classes and can understand what they are talking about! Disappointing!"
5,Great historical testament to an incredible pianist,"Josef Hofmann's piano technique is so effortless that it really needs to be heard to be believed. This CD is a historical recording and a great testament to the musician. The sound was much better than I had anticipated. The interview, while not adding much to the value, was still very interesting to hear. The final short selection, which is a snippet from the 1st concerto from a BBC shortwave broadcast, has absolutely terrible sound but Hofmann's brilliant playing is even more evident than in the full concertos.A must buy for all Hofmann fans and lovers of classical piano."
5,Wow. Where are my socks?,"This book knocked my socks off. Chris nails one branding issue after another. Great for business person or any individual looking to improve their personal effectiveness. If you read this book and Covey's Eighth Habit at the same time, though, weird (but cool) things may happen in your life...just to warn you!"
5,Inspiring,This book really inspired me to start a Non Profit for the education of people who have diabetes. The basis of my foundation is to offer nutrition counseling in the home
1,Bad Exsperience,This was a horriable exsperience. The packaging and the label stated that what i had was New Birth Birth Day/It's Been a Long Time. How ever what was on the cd ws some country western music. by Hank watson or someone like that. I have since reordered it from another seller. but have not recieved it as of yet.
2,EH,"the rings r really small and lucky like they were cheaply glues on. THe chain is also really small, my mom couldnt get it on without choking herself. Maybe the product is supposed to be like that, but i dont know, not buying any more of thse"
3,Updated Classic,"This is a new box on an old tube of lube.I guess mom and dad must've been happy to have ANYTHINGto grease things up a bit, but this is still a veryold-fashioned product.If you are more into modern sex like on the dvd NEW SEX NOWthen you will probably want to go with something slickerthan this -- like astroglide or wet lubes.But if you are into the straight missionary or even milddog, then this will work just fine."
5,KY JELLY RIPPED OFF,Just attempted to order and found the price to be double what was promoted after shipping. WHAT A DISREPUTABLE SERVICE YOU RUN. PLEASE REMOVE ALL MY INFORMATION FROM YOUR SERVICE IMMEDIATELY. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
3,Paralysed Age revisited,"I found some of the songs quite shy, for lack of a better word, it was somewhat frustrating hearing a group that has a potential that doesn't show on the final work; I'd like to see them flirting more with electronic and dancefloor beats, going the bloodsucker 2000-next step.Standouts include for me Drawning room, Cold winds, The grave shall be forever. I loved Empire of the vampire, so it's alwasy good hearing PA return."
5,Hits You're gonna love,"I have always loved Les Paul and Mary Ford, from the very first time I heard them together, and particularly Les Paul's stylings on the guitar. This album brings together all that was great about them together and individually as well.David W. McPeak"
2,"another trivial book about ""mysterious"" and ""unfair"" Japan","After having ""the lexus and the olive tree"" at our hands now, we do not have to read this book anymore I think. This is written by the man who knows how he can make American people feel good about themselves by not appreciating cultural differences and by imposing their own rules. Speaking of ""closedness"", there must be much more opportunities in Japan than now, only if any foreign people speak and write Japanese fluently. This must be a certain barrier, but it can be easily overcome if they are humble enough to learn Japanese language, the very essence of Japanese culture."
3,Not what I expected,"This book is very informative if you want to learn about the present day life of Japanese culture. The problem that I found was that there was no definite central character. The book needs improvement on the flow of the story. It had a good mix of fiction and non-fiction. In the story the author used facts from real life which helps the reader relate to it. There was a nice build up of tension throughout the story, but the ending was dissapointing. I expected a more dramatic ending. The interesting part of the book is the ideas of religions in different cultures and how the ideas of christianity are reflected in such an isolated society. The other good point of the story is that there are pieces of information which fit together to complete the puzzle. But again I was dissapointed by the ending. This is my opinion and if you disagree please feel free to email me."
4,the book for the true elfquest fan,This book really helps you understand the characters and plot a lot more. if you are like me then this book is for you.
1,I prefer the original,"This is the book that the church ""edited"" or in other words, ""rewrote"" in 1954; for a more accurate account, pick up the original and read it the way Lucy Mack Smith intended.Her original work was published in 1853. A few years later Brigham Young demanded the books be turned over to him, so they could be destroyed. Several copies remain and have been reprinted for people wanting to know the truth.[...]I mean, if you can't trust Joseph's mother, than who can you trust? The LDS church? I think not! Poor Mrs Smith would turn in her grave if she knew they had rewritten her diary! Shame on them!!!"
5,Through His Mother's Eyes,"You find it hard to discard the love the Prophet's mother had for her son, and the dedication and perserverance she showed through her support for him in the early years of the LDS church."
5,Awesome!,"This is a wonderful book and I would recommend it to everyone! You really learn more about Joseph Smith from Lucy's point of view. I really loved it and it wasn't too long, only 500 pages or so. Loved it!"
4,Satisfied,"Although the book was a tad overpriced, the condition was satisfactory. The jacket cover was well worn, but can be discarded."
5,Astounding and touching tribute to the dead,"If you only buy one photography book in your lifetime, this is it. Nobody has ever said so much with pictures about a dead subject."
4,very cose format to actual exam,"I have read only 4th volume of total 4 volume,very valuable q's format rarely found in other if compared to q's format, explanation is also very useful."
3,Human Skeleton Model,"It will do, but only because it will get covered by robot and humanoid body (chassis)."
4,A spiritual ride through the ethers,"This is a great album by Banco De Gaia. The crowd loved it (I was there!). This is a relatively popular but still unknown, but well loved by those who love this sort of music. If you want a general CD by Banco De Gaia, this is it. It has all their best tunes from their previous albums."
5,Jesus Our Guide,"This book is amazing. Although I've had 16 years of Catholic education and have studied my faith for years, I learned so much reading this book directed to fourth graders. It presents Old Testament history in a concise, easy to understand format. I gave this book to a friend who had never received any education in any faith. She said that she understood may things for the first time after reading the book. I highly recommend it for educating yourself and your children about the faith."
1,eureka season 3.0,felt that it should have been noted that dvd DID NOT contain the entire season. price reduction was not that great! so disappointed.
1,A ripoff!,"This is just 1/2 season, and you pay for a full season. Not a good deal! I don't see any where on the web page that this is just a half season."
1,Wonderful Series - Crappy marketing,"I agree with most of the reviews already here. I love this series and can't wait to see more this summer - but selling half a season at this price is greedy and insulting. I just bought an entire 12 year TV series for $55.00! Now I'm supposed to pay $20.00 for 8 episodes? Do the math -totally not worth it!I can only hope and pray that the powers that be on this come out with the complete season 3, soon after it airs this summer, at a reasonable price to satisfy the loyal fan base. I'll be waiting for it."
1,NOT a Whole Season!,"Sorry, but I won't buy a split season like this. It's ridiculous. There's no reason why a full season can't be sold. I really liked Eureka Seasons 1 and 2. Bought them new. Not now, not for this kind of crap. Whoever thought that this was a good idea should be fired. What, did you think it would make you more money to split the season? How about viewer disgust and loss? How much did you lose with the writer's strike and you lost viewers? And now you think it's a good thing to do the same thing (interrupt viewing of your show) by only producing half a season on DVD? If you can't get a clue, how about hiring people that have one? Sheesh!"
4,Eureka Season 3,"Amazon always delivers the best, the series is imaginative and innovative. I can't wait for the next season."
5,Eureka Season 3.0,"I can't wait for the rest of this unique show. It is extremely funny and I love the subtle jokes relating to science.Colin Ferguson, as Sheriff Carter, always appears to have such a dumb look on his face but he always manages to save the day.This show should appeal to a wide variety of people from various educational backgrounds. You really need to watch all the series as there is a developing back-story that keeps you coming back for more.Eureka: Season 3.0"
3,"Great, but too short.","Eureka is a fine show and its characters are fantastic! Colin Ferguson is particularly suited for his role. I own the first two seasons, and love the long-term plot development surrounding the individual episode subplots. Of course, I was going to buy Season 3. Unfortunately, the writer's strike shortened the season, and left me with the disappointed feeling of not getting complete value for my money."
1,Eureka 3.0.. WHY?????,"WHY.... is a reasonable request that deserves an answer from those who offer this fine series in 2 issues. The information provided on Amazon's site, as offered by consumers, clearly states that Eureka 3.0 will be followed in July, 09 with an additional dvd set that provides the remaining episodes for season 3. It is disturbing to believe that this is marketing developed with the intent to raise monies over an amount that would have been less if purchased as one set. Frankly this is insulting. Does this tactic satisfy instant gratification for those who cannot wait for the complete series? Do the math. Observe how this has been used with BSG and others. Unless there is something so blatant that I cannot see the forest for the trees, this issue is distasteful. I have canceled my original order as the fine people who have taken time to offer this information make it worthwhile to wait and see. I welcome insightful comments. Thank you. P.J. Today"
1,Not Paying Twice as Much!,"I absolutely agree with the comments I've seen that the burgeoning trend in issuing ""versions"" of these shows is insulting. I enjoy the show and have purchased seasons 1 and 2. I was looking forward to purchasing season 3 as well, but will absolutely not purchase in two installments, paying twice as much. If I can get season 3 as one package for a similar price as 1 and 2, I'm in. Until then, I can catch reruns!!! Hopefully enough people will agree and hold off - maybe the distributors will get the message!"
1,"Selling me half, Charge me half","I own seasons one and two, and I want to buy season three. I love the show. But splitting the season and selling me half at a time doesn't work for me. Guess I'll just watch the re-runs on TV as they occur. This was not a wise business decision. Maybe they will eventually package them together and sell it as one set. Right now though...too bad because I was prepared to buy."
1,Why cant they just give us the seasons on 1 dvd?,"Please dont suppose company greed. I am all for supporting a good show, but not to point in buying multiple box sets for the same season. They need to release 1 box set with ALL episodes not half. Dont support the money mongers that do this. Wait till they make 1 dvd. Same reason i havent bought any Mystery Science 3k. BTW when they do make full box sets i do buy ALL of them. I own macgyver, ateam, stargate, Gilligans island, F troop, and many more. But they all sell ALL the episodes in a single box set."
2,Bummer it's only half the season.,Love the show but EXTREMELY disappointed that this onlly contained the first half of the season. And now I have to wait for the second half.
1,1/2 a season is still too much when it was a bad season,"I understand that people are upset that they are selling this in half seasons, but to me, that might be a blessing.You see, the first half of season three was plain horrible.They introduce a new character to run GD and with it she brings the idea to sell advertising rights to companies in which they have their logos supported around town. Ummm, first of all, wasn't this a SECRET government town? Why would outside companies even know about Eureka? Second of all, it was a lame excuse to get product placement in the show. Now, I can understand and even support product placement if done well, but this made a Michael Bay movie product placement look subtle by comparison. They devoted a whole episode to a scenario that could only be resolved by using the special ingredient they had made for Degree Antiperspirant! Wow, and lame. Save your money on this one and when the last half of season 3 comes out, get it and pretend that this never happened."
1,one star for the half of the show - don't like being duped,"Love the series but cheating on loyal fans like that and issuing just half of the show under the title of the whole season is not fair. Money is an issue but not as much as thinking that you got the whole deal and finding out you have to wait for the second half for quite some time.If strike was to blame they should have announced it and do the whole season in one box set, I am sure most of the show fans would have waited without complaining."
1,Disappointed...feel like I have been taken for a ride,I was so excited to get Season 3 only top realize that only half of the season is on the 2 disk. Very disappointed in the way that SyFy has taken advantage of Eureka's loyal fans. Boo to them!!!!!!
5,Eureka 3.0,The DVD's looked brand new and in the wrapper. I paid an excellent price. They came on time. Couldn't ask for anything more!
3,"If you like Eureka, you'll like this set, BUT...","This is a good set, as far as it goes. I say that because it is only HALF of the season. The season was broken into two parts, so the video set was as well. Season 3 and 3.5. To get the entire year we have to buy both sets. :("
3,1/2 Season isn't all that is wrong with Season 3.0,"I agree that to issue half seasons is a method to gather as much profits as possible, and yet this should not be needed since profits are already gathered in another method which should make the production costs less, and reduce the costs to the consumer.I am really irritated that there is blatant advertising throughout the whole first eight episodes of the third season. Each episode is written to take full advantage of the sponsor's logo and product.Outside of those two factors, this would have received a 5 star review."
4,Ridiculous marketing...,"I just purchased Season ""3"" for $25, or so I thought, but there are only eight episodes on the DVDs (4 each), when the ""video on demand"" lists 18 shows. What a scam!!! Both my husband and I love Eureka, it's a totally unique kind of show, with subject matter that interests us, but this half ass DVD for season 3 really sucks. I had hoped we could watch the episodes we missed while Cable was out, but nooooooooo. So now I have to wait for the remaining episodes on another DVD set, at $25 a pop, again...I want what I paid for, all 18 episodes. Very disappointed..."
4,Enjoyable SciFi Series! Recommended!,"Season 3 of Eureka contains 8 solid episodes (cut short by the writer's strike) for this really clever and intelligent show. This season has life getting more complicated for Sheriff Carter, both on the job and in his personal life. There are some big changes that should make the next season (or continuation of this one) very interesting.Most of the deleted scenes on the DVD are interesting and add additional color to the episodes.Recommended, even if it is fewer episodes than the previous two seasons."
3,Good but...,"The show was great, as always, but like many others, I would have liked to know from the packaging that this wasn't all of season 3. Reading some reviews of this I now understand that it was split because of the writers' strike but it still would have been a lot better for the fans AND for PR of SciFi if they'd made it clear what was going on."
4,An interesting season,I have watched all episodes and I liked the show. The only problem I have noticed is that the subtitles suddenly disappeared in the middle of episode 5 and then the DVD stopped. It seems that there is a problem with either this particular DVD or DVDs are defect.
3,Incomplete season,"I love that show.have been following it since the pilot aired, and will hopefully continue to do so for a long time.The problem with this particular dvd pack is that it's only two third of the actual season.I didn't know when I ordered it, I thought that the last episodes of the season would be in it (yeah, I know, looking back at it, It does seem logical considering they can get more money this way)Anyway, 5 star for the show, minus two for the 5 missing episodes on this dvd pack."
1,Only HALF of Season 3,"Buyers Beware. Although this DVD is labelled 'Season 3', apparently this means something quite different than the previous ""Season 1"" and ""Season 2"" DVDs. In the first two DVDs, you actually received the ""Season"". This ""Season"" is only half a season long. I hate being conned. I'd already seen the first few episodes on Hulu but I was OK with that since I thought I was getting the whole season. As it turns out, I had seen 5 of the 8 episodes which is a lot different than 5 of 16."
3,"Was anxious to see this, but was disappointed","I LOVED the first two seasons of Eureka. I was anxious for season 3 to come out on DVD. I was surprised it was so inexpensive. Then I found out why it was so cheap... season 3 has less episodes than seasons 1 and 2. Yuck. :(A running subplot has also been added to season 3. This subplot consists of the restructuring of Global Dynamics and Eureka. This made season 3 unappealing to me.In my opinion, season 3 is anemic compared to the first two seasons. If they are smart, season 4 will consist of more episodes and better subplots."
2,Good show but I'm tried of this crap,"I'm so tried of TV series being broke up, why with a show like Eureka which has so few episodes. I'm done watching this series and buying the seasons."
3,Eureka review,This is a good season but very short for the price.There were only a few episodes in this season.
4,Quick Response,"I received this in less then 12 hours from the time I placed the order and it came as promised, I am very pleased with this order."
4,"Good, but made in China","Amazon suggested I buy this product, and I did. In terms of a fruit snack this is very nice in that it isn't overly sweet and has good fruit flavor.The one downside to this product is that it is made in China, which I didn't know when I ordered it. Given all of the product issues I personlly wouldn't buy food products produced there, but that is a personal choice."
3,"Not Bad, Mixed Bag","I'm a retro games fan and have most of the originals of these games somewhere in the basement, and all the emulators on my N-Gage. For the classics you could just stick with the GBA version or an emulator on any other system, but frankly the DS is some of the best portable hardware and makes the classics more enjoyable. A few of the ""remix"" versions I actually like, including Centipede and Warlords. If you buy it for Tempest be advised that this is by far the weakest game on the title."
3,Fair,I wouldn't say this is the worst game ever. But out of my personal experience I found only 1 game was impossible to control. Also the worst part is that you and a friend need retro atari classics game card to play something like pong.But on the good side many of the games such as asteroids and missle command were much easier to controll than using the control pad to play.I would recommend this game to those who love boosting their high scores and to those who miss the days of the simple games of the 80's. It will have good replay value for those.If your not that type of gamer stay away.Thanks for reading :)
2,Lame,"I gotta agree with the other reviewer, this game is difficult to play. While the stylus works well with certain games, i.e. Zookeeper, it doesn't work out well on this game. Further, the games are not really arcade-like (not as finely detailed at all), and the remix versions are even worse. But there are 10 games, making it less than $3 each, and I guess that gives you some bang for your buck. Just don't expect too much."
1,"Great Idea, Bad Execution","Ordinarily I really enjoy these classic collections. The inclusion of optional graphical modes was really neat, and I wish they'd do something similar in other classic compilations. Unfortunately, the controls made this set of games unplayable. When I'm in the mood for some retro-gaming, I don't want to have to worry about the interface. I just want to sit back, blast some bad guys, and enjoy the nostalgia. Forcing us to use unintuitive controls breaks the vibe and makes the game worthless."
3,Old school fun,Great collection of game for all the old school gamers. It brought back memories of the Atari and Colleco Vision. Also good for the younger generation.
3,get's old after a while,ok this compilation is ok. i'll admit that i'm a sucker for classics and that's why i got this. the first few days with this were really fun just expieriencing the classics. the next couple weeks i didn't play this that much... and now well a couple months after i bought it i barely play it. simply because i don't think that these games are as addicting now as they were then. games like castle and breakout are fun but are you really gonna sit down and play this for ages? in addition the games in super mario ds are more engaging and varied so i play those more often. this is fun but i reccomend buying it onsale because it's simply not worth $30. i'd pay $15 for it but not $30...
2,Old old games.,"Man,I got this game for Christmas and the games are so boring.And the games are so old."
1,Gaming fun,This package was a disappointment. Lots of games but really it was just 1 game put to many themes. Young kids might enjoy this but for casino game players this was disappointing. Would not recommend.
1,Not what I expected,"When I saw this package online I was happy to see it, I didn't realize it wasn't going to be a full screen product or have good graphics. I was expecting it to look like a slot machine. I was extremely disappointed, put it back in the box and haven't used it since it was installed. It was not an expensive purchase so I didn't return it but I certainly would not recommend it."
1,Total Rip-off,"I bought this thinking it would have tons of different games, but its only a handful of lame games with multiple amount/bonus options.Its very uninspired and boring.It should have been a warning sign that there is almost no description of various slots.Save your money - buy one of the other slot games on Amazon."
3,"""7007 Slots: Virtual Vegas"" Review","""7007 Slots: Virtual Vegas"" game and graphics did not impress me. I played this game only once. This game was a waste of my money and over-priced. ""Reel Deal"" and ""Masque"" slot games are the best."
1,Review : Virtual Vegas,Same games....just different pictures. Gives you selection of the same lame bonus on every game. Awful!
1,Las Vegas would go bankrupt if they ran like this!,"This game was given to me by a friend who bought it and didn't want it. I can see why.There isn't 7007 slots, there's TWO; a three-reel one-line slot and a five reel multi-line slot. The other 7005 variations aren't enough to me to be called different games. The variations are coin denominations, themes/reel pictures, bonus games, and real or fantasy payouts. Whoop-dee-doo.After playing for five minutes on each different slot (5 minutes times 2 slots equals 10 minutes) you'll get bored. At the very least they should have included a user-adjustable payout percentage (like entering that you want a 90% payout or other simulation) so you could practice for the casinos.The sound and graphics aren't good enough to keep you interested. In fact, by playabliity standards the simple Cherry Bandit PC slot game is light-years ahead of 7007 Slots.This is the game you buy someone to turn them OFF to slot machine gambling."
1,What a let down,"I must agree with most everyone else this is a total ripoff, looks like a great time but BORING, same few games with lots of cheesy variations, wish I had never bought it, I'll stick with Phantom or Hoyle from now on. Hope no one else gets suckered in on the glitzy box."
5,love slots,i love this game. i would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys slots. it has some of the slot games that i've seen in the casino
1,worth nothing,"This is a cheapest casino game I have had. It has more than 150 games but it is the combination of 30 games plus several bouns games so all the games are looks alike and plays alike. Plus this game does not support many basic Windows feature(like scroll mouse wheel). You can choose ""Three reels"" and ""five reels"" on each game but they are same . Low graphic and lack of selection on personal setting. There is no comparision with ""Bally Slot"" or ""Real Deal Slots"". Beside all of those, the game has very very low pay-off even in ""fantasy"" mode. In my mind, it is lower than actual pay-off in real casino. NO FUN. I wish I did not order it."
1,total disappointment,Should have listened to the other reviews. So far nothing can compare to PhantomX.
1,not very good,"horrible graphics, crappy games, lame bonus rounds. if this sounds like fun, by all means, buy this game!"
1,What a Rip Off!!,"This product was totally misrepresented. All they did was copy the same program repeatedly (100's of games--yeah right) and attach new icons. The bonus games are redundant. The whole game suite is a study in redundancy. Moreover, it's as boring as dirt!! I should have sent it back, but didn't feel like going through the hassle. They purposely made the cover look like Phantom EFX so that I thought it was a Phantom game. Stupid me! Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT BUY this ridiculous game."
1,Worst slot game,"If you plan to get video slots that are fun, try others such as Reel slots and Masque Slots. this game Virtual Slots 7007 is a waste of money. I thought this game would be cool, but it was very disappointing. Don't get this unless you wanted to be disappointed too! This is not a JOKE! The video and games machine were craps."
2,Disappointing!!!!,"After reading about the new book on the life of this musical"" genius"" I was anxious to see if there were any recordings of his work. This was the only one I found and I was very disappointed- the playing seems to have no life to it and it would appear that he has lost much of his musical ability with the years.sounds like an old tired pianist with very little hint of Genius- wish he had made earlier recording when he was supposedly at his peak"
2,If only the translation was close,"I have not yet read these poems in Arabic, but I was hoping the English version would offer some incentive to do so or at least a first glance at the luxurious original text. That did not happen, I have not been able to find the poetic fiber in these texts. I might try one original text to determine whether the fault is in the writing or in the translation."
2,They are SIBLINGS!!!,"one thing that bugged the heck out of me in this book was that while Rissa has agreed to be known as the daughter of the doctor and Jefferson is the adopted son of the doctor, therefore making them brother and sister, Rissa, contiunally throughout the book, refuses to acknowledge this and gets mad everytime Jefferson brings it up. i don't care that she was falling in love with him (which is rather icky when adopted siblings fall in love with in other in any case), he is still her brother if the father ADOPTED HIM and is her BIRTH FATHER. it was very annoying.i preferred the Cheney Duvall Series over this series. and why does it say this book is by Morris, Gilbert & J. Landon Ferguson? the picture clearly shows it's Gilbert and Lynn Morris."
4,ky jelly really hits the spot,what can I say? It did what it was supposed to....if you catch my drift....:)
3,Qiuck Shoulder Survey,"If you are looking for a booklet that gives you an overview about some of the problems that occur at the shoulder, then you need to read this information. This booklet provides an insight into some of the shoulder's weaknesses inherent in its design. It also suggests exercises that are appropriate to keep the shoulder strong and decrease the risk of injury. This booklet is not geared for someone with an advanced knowledge of shoulder anatomy and pathology."
2,Is it really that good?,"I know alot of people will be calling me a moron for writing this review, but I'm going to write it because I don't think the song ""Trigger"" is that good. I couldn't get into it on the Reroute to Remain album and I can't get into it now. It's not terrible, but I just can't get into it. That's all I have to say."
1,Hardcore completionists only...,"Single edit? HA!! More like guillotine work. What happened to the first minute of Trigger??Watch Them Feed is the best song here, but that's not saying much despite that it could find a home on Colony.As cover tracks go, 99% of the time the original artist does it better. Sadly, it couldn't be more obvious that Genesis does a much better song. Bad choice, guys...Last, and certainly least are the two remixes. Cloud Connected...club remix?? Should there be more sound to it? BORING!! I have heard good music made on the Commodore 64, and this version of Moonshield is NOT it.Horrible, horrible, horrible...the only real point to buying this is to maintain a complete In Flames collection. Buy something else.Oh, forgot the videos. I refuse to watch the ""Trigger"" video, since it's the edited song. As for ""Cloud Connected"", Anders looks like he needs to go to the bathroom throughout the shoot, and they should've done more with the Stargate motif."
4,A treat for die hard fans.,"Though it may not be an essential buy, this EP was a real treat for die hard fans. The EP begins with the single edit of Trigger. Its shortened a tad from the album version. Track 2 is where it gets good with Watch Them Feed, which is a rip roaring hard track. The real gem is track 3 which is a cover of Genesis's Land of Confusion. I was curious how the cover would sound and to my surprise it was really good. Some fans will no doubt hate it but I dug it. After that we get some really pointless remixes of Cloud Connected and Moonshield. Basically your gonna buy this EP for two tracks, Watch them Feed and Land of Connfusion. For fans like me, its worth every penny."
5,Stop Knocking In Flames,"There is a simple way of looking at this album- If your of fan of In Flames pre-Whoracle, than don't buy the album. Because its not the same. If you like the newer In Flames than buy it. I think the cover song is excellent and worth the price of the album. Don't ever compare In Flames to Metallica, Until I see In Flames play the VMA's, they are not even in the same planet. Criticize their new music all you want it is still the best metal to come out in a while."
4,A short snack well worth,"Its not a bad purchase if your a strong fan of In Flames. You will be pleased with the cloud connected remix, and moonshield we all know is a great tune!"
1,Lack of starting guidance.,"Purchased this kit with a gift certificate, and although there is a somewhat interesting 68 page little book, the kit was totally lacking any specific guidance and instruction on how to actually plant, water and nurture for a starting sapling tree. The pruning scissors that come with the kit are very cheap as well. We've set the seeds provided on the ""peat pellet"" provided, and used other sources to attempt to properly water and nurture; we'll see if we get a sapling. (?) The first reviewer's comments may well be on the mark."
5,The Boys Are Back!!!,It's been awhile since Little Texas has been on the scene and it's great to see them back together again. Live and Loud definitely does NOT disappoint. A true gem and a must have for all Little Texas Fans.
2,"Quality of the recording was not good in my opinion,",I like Little Texas but when I bought this I didn't realize it was a Live CD. I don't like live CD's and this one is no exception. I didn't think the sound was good. I would prefer a Greatest Hits that is not live. I think they sound a lot better in the studio. I was disappointed.
4,The life of an American Holocaust Survivor:Memories of the German Concentration Camps,The book is written by the subject's daughter. This is an excellent story of one of maybe two American's who were held hostage in Dachau and other concentration camps. I met Mitchell Pawlak one week before I read this book. He told me first hand of his experience for five years in concentration camps. His daughter details these horrible experiences that her father lived through.
4,Bye Bye Blues,"I have always have been a big fan of this duo. Les Paul was one of the giants in the industry, having broken new ground and set standards for those following. A good album and one I would recommend purchasing...."
4,bye bye blues/les paul,"it was great to be able to get this copy of ""bye bye blues"" by les paul.the quality was great and really met my needs to choreograph a line dance."
4,I love it.,"I purchased this from Olu herself at Wordstock 7 this summer in Fort Green Park, Brooklyn, NY. It's definitely tight and will stretch the mind to meet hers."
2,Blah,"I don't know why the other reviewers liked this book so much. I very much looked forward to reading the book. However, it did not live up to expectations. With so many other great fantasy books out there, this one was a waste of time...."
1,A big disappointment,"Never having heard of Anna Vissi, I bought ""Andidhoto"" basically on the strength of the cool Medusa cover art. Surprise: the album was great! So I went looking for more of her music, and chose Fotia on the basis of two rave reviews on Amazon.com. Big mistake! Most of this CD is bouncy dance pop that I wouldn't tolerate for more than 10 seconds if it came on my car radio. I don't know what to compare it to: Paula Abdul maybe?A couple of tracks are a little more interesting, with a Latin or traditional Greek flavor, but this CD will be gathering dust on my shelf, unless I can unload it at a garage sale. Vissi has an beautiful voice and (nowadays, as ""Andidhoto"" shows) extraordinarily emotive phrasing, but the 10+ year old ""Fotia"" shows how far she's come."
1,Not much value,"I am a fan of Charlotte Church's but I was very disappointed with this CD. There are only three songs on it, two of which I have on earlier CD's. Silent Night is lovely but not worth the cost of the CD. The entire CD plays only 10 minutes, not much music for the price."
5,Voice of an Angel,"This voice, at any age, would be wonderful. When you consider her age at the time of recording this album (12 yrs.)her talent is nothing short of a gift from God."
3,Just Wave Hello,The song is very good to listen to. Her voice is sweet and tender.I think Charlotte is not different to any other young girl. Her story might actually be inspirational to a lot of youth. I love her courage and the willingness to further improve. She has a great future ahead.
3,FORD AND SONY OTTA BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES!,"Ford Millenium anthem,""Just Wave Hello,"" What next? It is sick the companies are using this poor adorable child to advertise their product. Sony is not much better. Pushing Charlotte into exceedingly advanced repertoire just to attract curiousity to and make a profit. And the strategy is working! This is a terrible thing to do to a young tender talent, and in a few years she will be the one that will pay the price."
3,run of the mill suspense mystery,"I am a fan of Barbara Eden, who is a truly natural beauty. Unfortunately, this movie is pretty flat and even the surprises are formulaic. There is a suspicious though seductive guy watching her during a moment of marriage tension, she is still traumatized from an auto accident, and no one will listen to her fears. Of course, it isn't what it appears to be, or not completely, etc. The movie is pleasant enough, but kind of a bore."
3,"good postures, bad music",I liked the workout but the pan-flute music was disconcerting and too loud at times to hear the voice of Annie Carpenter. I like some soothing background music for my home practice but this music was so inconsistent in the volume that I wanted a way to turn it off so that I could enjoy the asanas and the voice.
4,Onegai Twins!,"This series was very good in my eyes. It is about a orphaned boy who is faced with the problem of having two girls claiming to be his sister. Anyway, the girls start living with him and that's when things get more interesting. If you watch the Onegai Teacher series, I warn you that this is not really a sequel. Just another cute series by Geneon. And I will also warn you that it shows the girls naked (not sexual) and at some points there are things that people misunderstand. But overall this is a great series that will always have you wondering who the sister is or if there's a sister at all."
2,Onegai Twins,"This is a cute anime, yet, just as Onegai (Please) Teacher is a bit on the *cough* preverted side, this one is too. So...not for all age levels."
4,Splendid!,"I was driving when I heard this song on the radio and when the announcer said it was Sometimes I Feel Like A Motherless Child by Bob Thompson, I knew I had to find this CD. I'd never heard of Bob Thompson, but he surely lets his fingers do the talking with his superb renditions of gospel classics. Sometimes I Feel Like A Motherless Child starts this beautiful journey and Thompson does not disappoint with his jazzy takes of My Lord, What A Morning, Every Time I Feel The Spirit and Joshua Fit The Battle of Jericho. Then Thompson slows things down with his soulful Deep River. The pace picks up again as Thompson gives us Over My Head with it's seemingly island/African influenced sound. Little David Play On Your Harp is another jazzy uptempo tune that'll have you tapping your toes and bobbing your head. As things slow down with Wade In The Water, Thompson rounds out this disc with the rousing Study War No More and Swing Low, Sweet Chariot. This is a great addition to your CD collection."
5,Cute!,I got this for me nephews 8th birthday! He is totally in to Dan Uggla and since I know Dan I got him to autograph it for my nephew. He LOVED it!!!
3,Battery Replacement,You need to keep this in a charger for it to keep a charge. I had it for 2 weeks out of the charger and when I went to use it on a weekend trip it was dead. Made me very mad.
5,groove armada kix,"groove armada's single ""i see you baby"" makes you want to get up and dance (which by the way isnt a very good idea while making pancakes.) Its a great song and i reccomend it to anyone with a groovy side."
4,Great fun! Great exercise! Great music!,"I bought Dance Praise (and eventually the expansion pack) in an attempt to find some sort of exercise that would be remotely enjoyable. I FOUND IT! I have very little (if any) natural rhythm, but I quickly got the hang of the dances in easy mode. By the end of the first weekend, I was trying out some hard ones. It's no longer a chore to get 30 minutes of vigorous exercise, and the music is very good. I don't generally listen to much music, but I've found myself singing these peppy, optimistic songs all the time. A few minor glitches cause me to give it only 4 stars overall. There's always room for improvement."
4,Clean Cute Movie,"I enjoyed this movie. It was a little contrived and unrealistic, but it was fun and enjoyable. I checked it out at the library and plan to buy it.It's a movie you will want to watch every once in a while. Some classic scenes. I'll let you watch it to find out which ones those are.The screenwriter could have done a better job making this well not as stupid. It was still enjoyable regardless."
4,Popstar,I purchased this DVD for my pre-teen granddaughter.It was clean-cut and entertaining-something that's not easy to find today. It was a very cute movie.
3,An Aaron Fan But...,"I Have No Problem With Movies Like This But I Just Dont Get It,Like Aaron IS A Popstar So Of Course He Has To Play One In This Movie. Just Like When Your A Singer And You Star In A Movie You HAve To Sing?? Aaron Would Never Get Sent Back To Public School..But This Is TV For Ya..Anyway Its About The Popstar Who Lets Fame Go To His Head So His Mother Sends Him Back To Public School And He Meets Friends And A Girl Finds Out His Is A Popstar... (Just Like ""The Biggest Fan"" With Chris Trousdale)"
5,Great,"Good movie, really corny and sappy but i love it! I received it before my scheduled time, I will definitely be buying from this buyer again!"
2,Cheesy!,I have not seen this movie in YEARS! I was so young. So this is the first time I have seen this movie in a long time and I remember I used to love it. I believe it was because I had a crush on Aaron Carter when I was younger. But I watched this the other day and the acting is so bad! lol. I was almost embarrassed to watch it! But it is cute! A good preteen movie. But it reminds me so much of my childhood that I have to say that I liked it quite a lot anyway.
4,GAILY INTERESTING,"A very interesting and fascinating book about Hollywood of long ago, especially concerning the homosexual casting couch operated by Henry Willson. We never heard of Willson, but he created or invented many stars, many of whom, like Willson, were gay, the gayest being good ol' Rock. I found the book dull and boring at the beginning---but only the beginning. Then I could not put it down. As another reviewer here said, the date of Rock Hudson's death is inncorect--a glaring and inexusable error. All in all, this book is entertaining reading and I enjoyed it."
3,Interesting Bio,"An interesting biography of the man who launched the career of Rock Hudson and other handsome young men like Guy Madison and Rory Calhoun. The lengths that Wilson would go to protect his own homosexuality as well as that of his clients was an indictment of the age of the Studio system and the morals of the time. Many of the actors choose to get married and live heterosexual lives rather than face denigration and humiliation, including Mr Hudson with a disasterous marriage to Henry Wilson's secretary Phyllis Gates (The verdict is still out on how much she really knew).Ultimately after finishing this book one feels nothing but pity and a bit of disdain for Henry Wilson as well as admiration for his eye for talent and good looks and his determination to make 'stars' out of his male clients."
3,The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson,"Same old! If you know nothing of this former ""Star maker"" it would be a great ""first read!""Really nothing new or earth shaking, but was informative."
2,Tedious,"Tedious and mean-spirited. Turgid and sleep-inducing. Long on promise, way short on delivery. Don't bother, it's a waste of money."
3,"Informative, but laboured style","Lots of juicy information, without tipping over into the salacious, however the author uses a rather laboured, occasionally pretentious style, which detracts from the momentum and pace of the narrative"
3,"As others have said, poorly written","I was really interested in reading this book and, while it's fun to read, as others have said, it's repetitive, poorly edited and full of catty nasty comments. If you are looking to find substantiated facts about the lives/loves of Hollywood stars in tne 1950's, forget it - this book is mainly innuendo and gossip and the chronology is terrible - can't this guy tell a story from beginning to end? NO!! He stops and starts and stops and starts to the point that you can't figure out what the hell he's trying to say. He needed a better editor!!! Don't buy it - the library is good enough!"
5,Best cleanser...........,"I saw the recent reviews so I decided to purchase this cleanser. Prompt delivery, I have used this product and it is great, leaves you feeling fresh and clean. Order this product you won't be disappointed, I have ordered another bottle.M. Hernandez"
5,My dad loved Les Paul and Mary Ford when he was a teenager!!,My dad grew up with Les Paul and Mary Ford and had records of them in High School!! He even had an LP of Les Paul The New Sound!! He may still have it!! I grew up listening to that one too!! What a talent Les Paul had becoming the inventor of the electric guitar!!!
5,Heavy Duty!,"Solid, heavy duty CD tray .... unlike the newer garbage (you can bend in half with 2 fingers) they are hawking at the stores. Oh, for the early 90s - When a tray was a tray!"
4,"IS NOT starring Craig T. Nelson, IS a fascinating documentary","This is included as part of Docurama's first ""Film Festival"" set and is an excellent example of a new documentarian doing an excellent job capturing both sides of an argument about land use. Even better, the real ""fire"" of the events is unanticipated by filmmaker Patrice O'Neill and caught her as off-guard as it will catch viewers."
2,"Too much, and not enough","This book is a real memory dump. I suspect there's nothing that Erickson found out about Henry that doesn't appear within these covers, including the names of Henry's favorite horses. A lot of detail would be excusable if I had come away with a good understanding of the man, but I didn't. The female characters are better drawn, i.e., Henry's wives. (Erickson's portrait of Anne Boleyn, as someone who grabbed for the brass ring and just missed, is more balanced than Hollywood's.) But, still, I think there's an element of passion missing here, given that this is a book about a man whose own daughter dug up his bones and burned them"
1,let down,i was hoping for a kaiju movie but what i got was a lonely boy who wishes his life wasnt the usual mundane horridness that it is. there is a monster in this movie for like five minutes and its just a nightmare... i wouldnt recomend buying it -_-
2,Demeking,Never watch this unless you want to learn about someone coming up with a story and selling it.
1,A fascinating subject but very poorly written,"The first chapter held promise, but then it fizzled away. The characters were drab, undeveloped and just plain boring. The plot, which could have been exciting and mystical, boiled down to...""and we did this, and then this, and then that...and then we went here..."" I am amazed that this book was even published, considering that it lacks suspense, the slightest drop of plot tension, developed characters, believable dialog...it reads like a book that every writing teacher and professional says to avoid."
1,Not what I expected...,"I was looking for Christian fiction. This book is not that. It is pure SciFi. The back of the book cover reads, ""What would it take to make you believe?"" I read it through hoping that it would explain itself in the end, but after taking a long time to get started, it ended quite abruptly. I couldn't figure out what religion this book was dealing as it handed out Jesus & God & reincarnation & existentialism in equal shares. I found the dialogue unnatural and very wordy. It lacked excitement. Sorry."
1,Good concept poorly done,"I found the hardback edition of this book on the sale table at Media Play, its price slashed to almost 1/4 its original cover price. After reading it, I now understand why. I don't know how such an fascinating subject could be written so poorly and still get published. The protagonist, John McGown, is weak and poorly drawn, the dialogue amateurish at best, and the plot drawn out to a sleepy meandering of ""first this happened, then that."" I was so disappointed I could have cried. It wasn't the story that was bad, but how it was written. I didn't know how much longer I could stand reading another character's ""yes"" response. Handled by a more experienced and talented writer, this might have been a wonderful book. The intriguing tale of a millinial crossroads is best left in the hands of a writer who knows how to write compelling fiction."
1,Glad I took it out from the library,"I can only say that I am glad I borrowed the book from the library and didn't waste money on it. A title and subject with promise, but that's where it ends. The characters are interchangeable, the dialog dull and flat. Everything is the story falls into place without a shred of suspense--and you really have to suspend your imagination. How many college professors can just get up and leave their class whenever they want? Their children are conveniently packed up when necessary. And those dream recollections...great for an insomniac to read because they will put you into a deep sleep. The ending gives you no clue as to what the sacred stones are really about...I think the author was probably so bored himself that he just put in a period and said that's the end. I gave this book one star only because Amazon does not permit you to rate in the negatives"
2,Dialogue a disappointment,"The subject of this book caught my eye immediately. By the second chapter, I could tell the author had little experience. The diaglogue was trite and flat. The subject had so much potential that I very disappointed at the end. Why is it that this type of fascinating subject cannot be matched with an author with similar talent? I felt the same way about the Celestine Prophsey."
3,Choose your battles,"This is the author's first work, not the product of a seasoned and polished writer. Indeed the novel does lack for dialogue but it does tie together places and ideas that anyone who watches the news can identify. I think there is a great deal to be said for writing a work that explains ideas to people and makes them wonder if it is true or not. A worse crime that a not so hot story is one that promises to explain something you are interested in and doesn't. Read it for diversion, that's about all."
4,messiah books,"Any book that has the word ""messiah"" in it catches my eye: Dune Messiah; Illusions: the adventures of a Reluctant Messiah, etc. So I picked up The Messiah Stones and was not disappointed. Any book that honestly and with integrity promotes the spiritual journey...the faith journey, is usually a good read for me; especially fiction. Messiah Stones was all of that. Granted that the ""young fatherless child growing up and picking up the father's legacy"" theme is a bit dramatic, it did not, for me, take from the basic ""how God and humankind relate"" ideas set forth. I would strongly recommend this for anyone who enjoys the various ways we human beings interpret our relationship with God...in fiction as well as in real life. Which is which? is perhaps an interesting question, too!"
1,A good short story but a poor novel,"This book has an interesting plot and would have made a good short story. To drag the storyline out to fill a novel the author wrote page after page of personal opinion, philoposy, and other non-plot advancing material. It's a book where you read the first sentence of the paragraph and skip the rest while searching for the storyline to continue. Even the final conclusion is unsatisfying."
5,An excellent novel about religion and faith,"A call from a Washington lawyer to John McGowan about a misterious inheritance left by his father long time ago drive John and his wife Sarah to a search through time and remembrances about his long gone father but at the same time the searching of the stones awake in the couple and their collaborators the desire and necessity of recover their lost faith because of their excepticism, fear to love or suffering and the racionalism very common in our time.This is a spiritual story which message is simple but complicated at the same time, the search of the true through faith is a long journey with peace to ourself and love to one's neighbor at the end of it."
3,too easy,"After reading all the great reviews, I expected this puzzle to be more challenging. We gave one to each of our sons and their families on Christmas Eve after going on a hot air balloon ride a couple of weeks ago. It took one family (son, wife, children ages 8 & 9) less than ten minutes to solve it. Either they were incredibly lucky or this puzzle isn't as difficult as most reviews say."
3,Not drop proof,I bought this watch as a gift for my husband...It was exactly the type of watch he likes to wear but it didn't survive when he dropped it on the sidewalk...
5,Nice thoughts,"This is actually two books, one for women, and flip it over and around, and the other side is for men. I cheated and looked at both sides, even though my husband pouted because I checked out all of the good ideas, but it's pretty good. I liked that it had lots of things that were pretty useful, but I was a little bummed that both sides have a lot of the same ideas, or just the other side of the same idea ('learn to like his old flannel shirt', and 'if she doesn't like your flannel, meybe get rid of it' kind of things). Lots of concessions, but pretty good for the ideas that they give, and maybe you'll get a couple of your own by reading what they have."
3,they have done better but still worth an occasional listening,"luxt has comeout with better cd's in the past but this is still worth getting if ur any kind of fan of the band. some of the highlights are: american beast,suck it down,cease and jitter. The last couple of tracks are interesting but not so much a good thing. there is an acoustic song which should have been left off the cd cuz it throws off the whole structure.if u are new to luxt then go with razen eden or chromosex and maybe pick this up later but not a good one to start with."
3,Every Luxt Album Reinvents Their Style,"Yet they try too hard on this album. Don't get me wrong, I love the band to death, but they've turned their classics Nerve, Life is Pain, American Beast, + Suck it Down into nu-metal songs that don't sound...Luxt-ish, so it takes a little while to get used to. They have live drums as opposed to the (good/better) synthesized percussion they used to have, and their guitars are more ""heavy-metal."" It's an ok album, nothing like how the original songs on this cd were tho."
4,break away in style,"this album is a new direction stylistically for luxt, and quite a break from their previous album. they've seemed to have a found a style that works well for them and it sounds pretty damn good to me. i love the double vocals that anna and erie are known for and the new complexities to their music in american beast. only reason it's not a five star for me i very much preferred the orignal version of the song american beast and don't care for the album version nearly as much."
5,Daisy Cake Pan,"Pan results in a beautiful cake. I had no difficulty removing it from the pan - used the leading cooking spray, then dusted it thoroughly with cake flour and tapped out the excess. I was surprised the pan holds a full box mix - it doesn't look like it would. The cake mix that allows you to add instant pudding to produce a pound cake version works well since it has more ""substance"" than the regular cake mix version. I am looking forward to doing a lemon cake with a glaze to highlight the daisies. This first time I did devils food and then outlined the daisies with the aerosole canned frosting and M&Ms in the middle of each flower. It turned out very cute and whimsical, and my four year old granddaughter loved it."
4,A Good Read!,"Individual investors are constantly frustrated by their inability to beat the market. Most portfolios lag behind benchmarks because investors fall in love with stories and chase stocks with high valuations. Such a strategy (if undisciplined buying and selling can be called a strategy) is exactly the wrong tack to take. James O’Shaughnessy painstakingly tracked stock returns over a 45-year period and found that investing in companies on traditional value measures — PE ratios, price-to-sales ratios, and price-to-book ratios — beat the market. Unfortunately for today’s investors, the data for this study runs only through 1996, and misses much of Internet boom, in which traditional measures like PE ratios were abandoned with abandon. Nevertheless, we recommend this clear and insightful book to all investors, especially those newcomers who have to this point been carried along by the market bandwagon, but one day might need a crash course in some time-tested investment strategies."
4,What works in Canada,"Some of the reviews comment on the difficulty in using O'Shaughnessy's approach to pick individual stocks. In Canada, this problem is solved by the availability of three mutual funds using O'Shaughnessy's method. These funds are managed by James O'Shaughnessy/Bear Stearns and sold in Canada by RBC (Royal Bank of Canada).Each of the three funds have far exceeded the underlying index on which they are based (S&P 500 and S&P/TSX Composite Index). For example, the O'Shaughnessy US Value Fund had a compound annual growth rate of 5.5% for the five year period ending May 31, 2004. The O'Shaughnessy US Growth Fund return for the same period was 11.6%. Lastly, the O'Shaughnessy Canadian Equity Fund return was 13.6%. These returns are hard to argue with. Set your search engine to look for ""rbc o'shaughnessy"" if you are interested in the details."
2,"Review for 2011, fourth edition","I am a big fan of James O'Shaughnessy and I use a number of the strategies he outlined previously with good results.I have returned my copy of the 4th edition. The previous editions had updated data for each strategy discussed, plus new strategies that were examined. Unfortunately, this edition does not. While I am interested in hearing his new findings, I expected, wanted and needed data updates for all the strategies previously reviewed, particularly those I use or am considering using. I was totally surprised and disappointed by this change.I highly recommend his 3rd edition of this book."
1,completely useless,"one of the most basic problem: what level is book for? if for beginner, it doesn't explain so much terms, like ""price-to-ratio"", ""price-to -book"", etc, it neither give a definition or how to compute it in reality; if for professional, it lacks of strick statistic annalysis, the result basicly comes from the author's subjective judgement. Besides, he only mentioned something well-known fact, like: ""investment in big company is a safe way.."", why a reader needs this kind of even-baby-known fact? I am regret that I cannot refund this book, this is probably the only book I think I should refund after I bought so many books from online store."
3,Worth Reading But Not Spectacular.,"O'Shaughnessy really had to fluff up the book by repeating himself over and over again, but hey, you'll be reading this book to LEARN -- who cares about his writing style. A basic summary for this book is ""Don't pay too much for a stock!"" This book is a quick read and you might as well wait for the cheaper paperback version, or get it out of your library. I'm not sure if the hardcover version is worth the price.Frankly, although I thought this book is definately worth reading, I'd recommend Mary Buffett's ""Buffettology"" over this book any day of the week. Her book is definately worth the hardcover price. (Too bad I got it in paperback.) :-)"
2,Old book,"Like most investing books, this one tries to point the reader to relationships between published accounting parameters that could suggest superior returns over long term ( 25+, 50+ years).The issue I have with back testing of any formulas over such long duration relates to accounting changes over that duration. The book is mute on how to account for the accounting changes. For example, stock based compensation reporting today is different from 5 years ago. Yet the book shows no adjustments and lumps the earnings shown today w/ those from ten years ago.Also, it is lacking in clear detail about data sources and formulas used for various steps of algorithms."
3,Review rankings and the Dow are correlated,"It is a funny thing about these reviews. Most reviews for most financial market books seem a little overzealous. Converted actually. All it would take is a real solid bear market and books like this would rank (in reviewer's eyes) along with the mutual funds. Three or four out of ten. Anyway this is an average read. And as one other review noted, the method is flawed. But that is the way it is with many stock picking manuals. Most are not for me. But following recent tradition I give this book six out of ten ... because that is how well my (mostly Antipodean) portfolio is standing up"
3,"Better than ""How to Retire Rich"" but not much better.","This book is for long term investors who want to rotate their portfolios once per year. Basically the author looked at several strategies ranging from low p/e's to high annualized growth rates and everything in between. He back tested the strategies from 12/31/1954-12/31/1996 he then would purchase the bottom 50 and the top 50 for that screening category and ranked the results. The highest strategy was Price to Sales ratio under 1, with high relative strength, this strategy returned a compound interest of 18.62% over the 45 year time span. Thus a $10,000 investment would become $12,999,698!Now if I were you I'd just go to the library and check out the book since only the results are really the important part of the book.Reed Floren"
3,too charty,"This book was fully annotated and thoroughly researched. However Mr. O'Shaunessy could have much more concisely said, ""buy low and sell high."" In other words this book says to buy LOW price/sales, price/book, and price/earnings ratios. Stay away from HIGH price/sales, price/book and price/earnings ratios. This is supported by tons of charts. I bet there are over 200 pages of just charts. I am a neophyte investor. I have found the Motley Fool Investment Guide (Gardner) to be much more helpful to me (and easier to read) at this stage of my investing career."
5,Excellent Book that can be implemented,"This is the most interesting book I read in the last few years. I buy a lot of books on investing. Thought there is lot of data, authors explain how to how to interpret it. Granted this is not a one-stop system. But ideas are easy to implement with a spreadsheet. I have some decent results so far in my returns implementing the ideas. The author has done a lot of research on different combination of factors that produces good returns and hence it is worth taking a look. This book will complement your knowledge on investing."
4,Good review of Wall Street beating methods,"A great example how we should use to past to make predictions for the future. I've alreade red several books on backtesting, but this one is truly an example in this subject. The author shares al his findings into the greatest detail and shows how you could have turned 10.000$ into 22 million dollar over the past decennia.One thing I didn't like in this book is the disregard of stops after the strategy gives an entry signal. In my opinion, this is the most crucial element a strategy should contain. Using any of these strategies in a bear market could tear down your overal performance. A simple % stop or equity stop could give the necessary protection.On the author his website you can also find a link to a website which shows how you can backtest strategies yourself.Edit: Here's a link to an out-of-sample test for the Cornerstone strategies from 1996-2008: [...]"
4,What really works,"I like books that demonstrate what really works using empirical evidence, rather than what should work based on an author's latest theory. So I like this book.The numerous tables will put some people off, but those people will still find some value in the early chapters that tell home truths about investing, dispel some myths, and explore how (human) investors make certain decision despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.I wish I'd found this book before embarking on my own bookStock Fundamentals On Trial: Do Dividend Yield, P/E and PEG Really Work?in which I attempted to take a similar empirical approach. Which leads me to a word or warning...Don't take even empirical evidence on face value. In some cases we came to different conclusions, which just goes to show that there are lies, damn lies, and statistics!"
4,Good starting point for investment systems.,"The information this book contains needs some sifting through and could have been better writen. But, this is a good starting point for investors trying to make an investment system that works."
5,"Strategies, not stocks.","The message of this book can be summed up in one sentence as : ""It's the strategies, stupid!"". It steers clear of anecdotes, stories and ""exciting"" narratives, and zeroes in on what REALLY matters most -- investment success in the face of varied market conditions and over long periods of time.If the book doesn't identify specific companies, or the market conditions at any time, it is for a good reason -- investing is most successful if practised unemotionally.Properly practised, investing should be a reasonably boring activity. If I wanted entertainment or thrills, I will go pick up a John Grisham novel or drive over to the friendly neighborhood theater screening ""Star Wars""!This book is what investors always needed, but didn't know how to ask for! If I give it a ""9"" instead of a ""10"", it is because I expect the next edition to be even better than the current one!Highly recommended."
3,"Seems useful, but is it?","I read this book with great interest, but came away from it without knowing what to do with what I had learned. It has tons of data and analyzes lots of investing strategies. However, the book's most highly recommended investing style would require the individual either to hold 100 different equities or to invest in the author's mutual funds. It is unclear what results might pertain if you invested in only 10 to 20 stocks, which I suspect is a much more typical number for the individual investor. Nonetheless, it is worth reading."
2,A Well Done Rehash Without Attribution,"This book does a good job rehashing a lot of what empirical academic finance has found in the last 15 years. Unfortunately, only the most passing attempts at attribution are performing, making the uninformed reader falsely believe that the author discovered any of the the things he reports. A shame to mar a good book."
2,Statistician?,"This book was definately the result of many hours of crunching data and formulating convictions about it. I believe that the author could have had some help with the statistics behind his endeavor. You really have to question his understanding of statistics. The format of the book was weak. About two pages of text per 20 graphs that restate the text for when your eyes get tired of trying to read the words. There is some value in reading this book, hence the two stars. You will realize somewhat of a strategy, but because of his fishy smelling data and conclusions, I would steer clear."
1,STINKS!,"The book has no unique message or insight; it merely regurgitates standard definitions of stock terminology, then supports each with the same litney of tables and graphs - totally boring. If I purchase a book on a particular subject, I expect to gain a unique insight or to be entertained by personal experiences on the subject. This book does neither. 50% of the book contains tables of statistics without identifying companies or market conditions at the time. A book to dazzle one's mother-in-law."
2,Takes some experimenting to use,"I have two issues with this grill: The flame blows out easily and it takes some experimentation to understand how not to burn your food. Unless it is a fairly still day, the least breeze potentially will blow out the flame. I would recommend putting some kind of wind barrier up to deal with that problem, but make sure it isn't flammable. For cooking, after many overcooked (burned) burgers, I've found that you need to heat the grill first with both burners, then turn one off and place your food items over the non-burning side. In other words, if you don't use indirect heat, your food will either be charred or underdone (because you will pull it off when the outside looks done, but the inside will be nearly raw). Turning the burners down to the lowest setting doesn't help with this problem."
3,Ford Pick-Ups / Expedition Auto Reapair Manual,"Book is OK for the weekend mechanic/owner for minor repairs, but not intended for major repairs help. Book is more general in information."
1,Ford Pickups & Expedition : Lincoln Navigator Automotive Rep,When will you have 1999 models for sale. Thank you. I have to rate a book I have not read.
2,received vs expectations,"I ordered this elegant looking watch for my husband for Christmas. I liked it because of the slim profile, shiny band and not too bling blingy. It arrived looking great. When hubby opened it up, he liked it too but was immediately disappointed to discover it was not even working! I think when I purchase a new watch, it should come in working order. The only thing I expected to have to pay extra for would be to have extra links removed to customize the band fit. Very disappointed."
5,It is a magnificent book.,It is an extremely goood book which is full of beautiful words that help you make important adjustments in your life on the way to an ideal life.
5,Don't be prejudice and just examine it!,It disturbed me when i read one of the reviews here. I wonder if that person read this book or not. I think he didn't. You can accuse everyone and everyone on a good path has been accused since Adam and Eve. Jesus too was a criminal(!) for some. Try to read this book like everybook without prejudice. Don't care what others say and try to find out your own opinion. This book is a pathway to real ethics. Enjoy...
5,"Nice video cuts, fascinating lead voice","Only 6 tracks on it but a good pick. Songs that touch your heart & soul (""Amazed"", ""I'm Already There"") - the lead voice is perfect and unreplaceable like Justin Hayward's of the Moody Blues. The last track is a funny cartoon of the houseman's-nightmare-song ""Mr. Mom""; you can't help to smile. Sound is also o.k. if only Dolby stereo is selected, but could be better. May be great in 5.1 (no chance to check, our cats would kill us to own that stuff...)"
5,Dermalogica Exfoliating Face Brush...,This Dermalogica Exfoliating Face Brush Is Great i love it beacuse its soft on your skin it dosent irritate the skin at all... The bristles of this face brush is very soft so if your looking for a soft face brush This is it. But if your looking for a more Rough bristle face brush than this is not it....Hope that Helps =)
4,Good for 4 or 5 year olds.,"I was very disappointed when I first looked at this book. It is very basic and hardly seems to provide enough information to be worthwhile. But when I read it to my four year old it solicited a string of questions. So it probably has the about the right amount of information for a very basic introduction to soccer, which is all the intended audience is ready for. Overall I would recommend it."
5,Penny Polar Bear snappy books,Our two year old Grand-daughter loves these books. The interaction and story line provides reading interest over and over. Thanks
3,"Fast Service, Book looks like it has had water damage....","Fast Service, However the book looked like it had water damage. Would be hesitant to buy from again.I am still deciding if I can give this as a gift."
5,I luved this book!,"I really liked this book, but something was missing. Why does what happens have to happen? It's unfair. And about Ken and Jessica...if Jessica doesn't care for Ken anymore, why not tell him instead of cheating on him! And Christian. He really loves Jessica. Even when he finds out Jessica has a boyfriend and was going out with Ken while going out with him he still loves her. That not a high-school sweetheart. That's not a little-kids crush. That's love. Real love. And Christian is SO caring. So sweet. But Ken is to. This book is great, but it's weepy when you find out what happened to Christian, something that'll affect Jessica for the rest of her life."
5,Jessica loves a surfer and dates Ken Matthews,"When Palisades and Sweet Valley have a rivalry between basketball games,Elizabeth and Enid meet Marla Daniels and Caitlin Alexander. They write for the Palisades Penegon[sp] While surfing,Jessica meets Christian Gorman,a gorgeous Palisades surfer,and she she's sufing with him and dating him and Ken Matthews at the same time. Palisades and Sweet Valley have a masquerade ball."
1,wrong part,Try to contact seller guy .But get no respond to make sure right part. After that part arrived was wrong part.
5,Back in time...,This took me back to the 80's and Sixteen Cadle days. Good group and it arrived in good condition.
5,Nice...,I picked up this album because I liked Blue Eyes. Good call on my part. This cd is made up of the kind of smooth rhythms and heartfelt lyrics that make it easy to listen to...a lot....Buy it
5,Great album,"This album is a great album for anyone's collection. catchy lines, catchy tunes. why more people don't like it is beyond me. maybe THEY haven't listened to him yet. get the album. you won't be disappointed!"
2,Same old same old,"The two star review has nothing to do with the music, the music is just fine. The two stars is for this being a rehash of the deal of the day. This same download was the deal of the day on May 13th 2009, only it was $1.99 then. I don't know who picks these deals but with millions of downloads to choose from we shouldn't be seeing the same ones less than a year apart."
3,My mistake.,"I misread the title of this CD as ""Who Are You"" by the Who and now I am stuck with a lousy CD. Don't make the same mistake I did, dear Amazon friends!"
1,Bad,Received an unwanted teachers review copy. Please be more efficient with your sales info... Don't buy please!! . . .
5,this book is for you IF...,"1. You enjoyed Catcher in the Rye (please, PLEASE tell me you've read it, it's incredible) I read them pretty much in succession accidentally, but both of the characters are similiar in ways. The author uses the same stream of conscience technique, or whatever it's called.2. You're not looking for a ""light, fluffy"" read. It's not dark and scary, but certainly not light or fluffy.3. You want to read an excellent book.4. Aged 15-21, give or take a couple years."
1,What a crock,"This book was stupid. Beck was annoying and complained constantly. She's a dumb, self obsessed loser. I didn't find anything redeeming about Beck and the sex scenes were stale and didn't ring true as though she was relating experiences she'd fantasized for but never could've had. And even then, they were *not* hot.Finally, who questions their whole life after seeing some dumb jock make a stupid mistake? Whatever."
5,A must-have for college students,"I couldn't put this book down. As a recent college grad, I definately think this book dealt with common but rarely mentioned problems for college students. There are so many things they we think about but never talk about, and this book discusses them all. I really enjoyed this book."
5,"More like this, please","In Number Six Fumbles, Solar-Tuttle has created a smart, brassy, loveable narrator who manages to beboth shrewd and self-deprecating. She spits out the details of her life bluntly and unapologetically.Think Holden Caulfield meets Carrie from Sex and the City, if that's possible. However you defineher, there's something about her, and there's something about this writer, that works. I loved her,and she carries the novel."
3,*Another* Beach Boys collection? Skip this one...,"This 10-track CD does contain classics such as ""Fun, Fun, Fun,"" ""California Girls,"" ""Good Vibrations,"" ""I Get Around,"" ""Help Me, Rhonda,"" ""Wouldn't It Be Nice,"" ""Barbara Ann,"" ""Surfer Girl,"" ""Surfin' USA,"" and ""Be True To Your School."" However, this ground has been trodden before. And you're missing songs like ""409,"" ""Little Deuce Coupe,"" ""Don't Worry Baby,"" and ""Dance, Dance, Dance,"" not to mention deeper material such as ""God Only Knows."" This collection only spans four years of the Beach Boys' career, 1963 to 1966. Even if you're only interested in their early period you can do better than this.If you only buy one Beach Boys album...make sure it isn't this one.5 stars for the music and 1 star for the compilation averages to 3 stars overall."
3,Miss de Bourgh's Adventure,"Short novel but good read, especially if you wish to add to your collection the various novels that have been written on the characters originally penned by Jane Austen as well as new characters always being introduced by the many authors that write the ""What If's"" to Pride & Prejudice. I enjoyed this book. Had an interesting storyline."
5,There's more to Nepal than trekking,"There's more to Nepal than climbing, trekking or the teeming streets of Kathmandu. Through thoughtful writing and lively drawings, Sally Olds and Marge Roche invite us to share their involvement in the life of a remote Rai village. We learn about joyous festivals, meet fascinating people and become part of the struggle to live daily life without the amenities we consider necessary. The freindships they make stir our imagination. And by recording their thoughts and reactions to what they've seen, they raise interesting questions on the effect tourists are having on the village and Nepal itself."
3,Sufficient for the purpose,"This is a good, solid product for temporary child-proofing. However, the area I needed to block had baseboards along the walls, so I couldn't use this (the walls need to be level up and down.) I ended up using it in a different place in the apartment, and it's certainly easy to put up and take down. All in all, a fine product if you don't need it to be permanent."
2,grrr,"The sides are uneven, it is impossible to keep it up. It does not set against the wall evenly and as soon as my 3 lbs dog pushes on it then wooops, falls over. Spend a few more dollars and get a gate that is safe!"
4,good case for the value,"the delivery arrived before scheduled. I was a bit surprised when I saw this guitar case in person. It is definitely more beautiful than I anticipated and more professionally looking with the golden latches around. My beloved seagull fit right in it. I loved the solid ""thud"" sound as I open and close the case, definitely ""music"" to my ears.I am happy with my purchase with a minor quip though. It is certainly heavier than it looks. I know it is meant to be a protective hard shell casing, but if it is lighter then it will be even more perfect."
5,great quality guitar case for the price,"I purchased this guitar case as a gift and was very satisfied. The inside was well cushioned with a sizable storage compartment, 8"" x 3 1/2"" x 4 1/2"" at its narrowest point. The price was half that of the least expensive case in a local music store and the quality was far better."
4,Great case!,"I received my guitar case today - I just ordered it 2 or 3 days ago - so really fast shipping. It's more than what I was expecting for the price. Only one problem. One of the locks actually locks and needs a key. Guess where the keys were? Yep - inside the case. Seriously? Someone else had this problem and left a comment about how to get it open. Open all of the other latches, then kind of line up the top a bottom and push down a little bit (not too hard) above the locked latch and giggle the latch until it opens. If it wasn't for that, I would have given it 5 stars. The interior is plush, black padding. My dreadnought fits inside perfectly. Lots of room in the compartment for strings, strap, and other accessories. Mine doesn't seem to have a problem lining up the top and bottom like others have mentioned. I'm very pleased."
5,guitar case review,"For the price, it is more than I expected. Now I have protection for my guitar, I can easily carry it about, AND THE INSIDE LINER WITH A SPECIAL COMPARTMENT gives it the expensive look! Good product."
5,Satisfied,"My first guitar case to my first acoustic guitar everand im completely satisfied, black leather with gold, the inside is furry sorta like a mink soft material,and has a key so it can be locked"
4,Great Deal!,"I was a little bit concerned about the quality of this case considering the price, but then decided it would be fine since I just needed someplace to keep my guitar in the house. I was pleasantly suprised when I opened the box. It's well made with stitching around the edge with no loose threads. It is a very snug fit for my dreadnaught, the lining is very plush, and the storage compartment is more then large enough to hold all my accessories. The clips open and close with ease, and the case also locks. The only reason I gave this case 4 stars instead of 5 was I felt that the actual padding in the case could be a little thicker, but since I am not traveling with my guitar, its fine for me. For the price, you can't go wrong!"
2,"Solid build, TERRIBLE latches","I bought this to protect my favorite acoustic guitar on its international trip from Japan to the United States and I'm VERY disappointed. The case itself feels solid enough, but, the latches are next to useless. Only the locking latch actually secures tightly. All the other latches barely feel closed and open at the lightest touch. I'm using two luggage straps around the case to keep it closed and I fully expect them to be the only thing keeping the guitar in the case. Additionally, I have so little confidence that the case will stay closed on its own, I'm putting it in the box that the case came in to ship it back ahead of me instead of taking it with me in my luggage as originally planned.I will be replacing this case as soon as I get to the States again. It will work great for a storage case in the house that will not go anywhere, but, completely useless for any sort of travel at all."
5,Awesome Case & Awesome Value,My daughter bought this for her acoustic guitar and it is perfect. It is well constructed with great padding to keep her guitar from moving around. She paid $49.99 + tax. It came with free shipping! It also arrived the very next day from when we ordered it!! We would definitely recommend this case from this seller.
5,Great Fit,I have a Oscar Schmidt OG2NLH Dreadnought Acoustic Guitar Left Handed that I needed a case for. This was a perfect fit.
4,Guitar hardcase -- Good product for the money,I bought this guitar case as a Christmas present for my son. He loved it. This is a good product for the money. Comparable cases at music stores were much more expensive. I would recommend this product.
5,excellent,"Buy Dove Pro acoustic guitar and fits perfectly in this case very well built, sufficient to protect the guitar !!!!!"
5,Excellent,Great hard case and the price was amazingly reasonable. My husband is a musician and was really impressed with this case.
2,"Wrong title, wrong size","This is not a book for growing rich, it only explains some basics of the US economy. The author repeats itself too much, maybe it could have been a better book if it had less than 100 pages and not 300"
3,fairly dull,"eternal youth wasn't as good as FBH's first album, memories of love. the 2 bsides on this EP aren't really memorable, and the mixes of losing your affection tend to be long and monotonous. pick up memories of love instead."
3,Not worth the money.,The table isn't really worth the money. The parts arent made of quality materials and the corners were damaged when I recieved it. It is very easy to strip the screws that come with it.
4,GREAT BOOK,"This book shows you lots of cool things like How to Blow a Double Bubble, Get ready For school in Ten minutes, draw really good cartoon animals, And How to pack for a sleepover. I'ts good book. Especilly when your bored."
4,A Must Have For All Girls,"My 8-year old daughter loves this book! The step-by-step instructions are easy to follow and the full-color photos and illustrations help make even the most complicated manuevers seem easy to master! She's learned how to blow buggle-gum bubbles, eat with chopsticks and build a castle with cards! She's looking forward to mastering many more of the tricks over the summer break!"
2,Ok,"This is not a great book. Some of the instructions are easy to understand, but don't work. Immature and definatly for ages 8 and under."
5,Chicago Blues,"I own many CDs, many types of music,this is by far the best, if you like the blues, you will love this CD. Good old Chicago Blues, worth every penny, Never get tired of playing this one."
3,Meandering Tale,"""The Man in the Tree"" is the first Damon Knight novel I've read. I wish it had been more tightly written. Much time is spent on a pedestrian, obsessed-cop strand of the story. We wait and wait for our protagonist to discover the extent of his supernatural power and then decide what to do with it. Detours through life-as-a-New-York-artist and life-in-a-traveling-circus are interesting for themselves, but don't ramp up well to the mythic ending."
5,Bill Evans RULES!,"This album is a rare one, in my opinion, inthat ALL of the tracks are positively fluid and enjoyable. I've ripped it to both my PC and laptop and play it in the background, frequently, when playing games or online, which is most of the time. It's one of several I now own and has become a huge favorite. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this one."
1,Childlike Simplifaction; Rife with Error,"This book is a disappointment. I've read through half of the first section and been dismayed to find approximately one to two grammer and/or spelling mistakes per page, on average. I've also come across at least one flat-out factual inaccuracy and found my jaw gaping at the oversimpification of the science. Simplification is one thing, simplification to the point of being misleading is another thing. So far I've found this book to be written at a sixth to seventh grade level. This is insulting. That said, I'm sure there is good information in this book; however, if I find myself in unfamiliar territory I don't think I'll be able to trust it based on what I've seen so far. So, bottom line: beware. If you have a poor or nonexistent science background this book might be just the thing. If you've always been a science buff, skip it. If you do buy, just remember that you shouldn't believe everything you read. Good luck."
1,Terrible movie,This movie is terrible. It is about two men who are friends. One teaches at Princeton and heads to Vegas for a conference. His best friend asks him to try to see if he can find his daughter for him while he is there. The teacher finds the daughter who is now a prostitute. He ends up sleeping with her and falling in love with her. This is the worst love story I have ever seen.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"This movie was so, so, awful.Don't waste your time or money. One of the dumbest movies I have ever seen."
1,Outrageously Bad....,There's a line in the movie where Julian Sands says:I think somethings burning.Too bad it wasn't the script. How Julian Sands wound up in this terrible terrible movie is unbelievable. It's cliched. It's shallow. It's unbelievably badly written. There are moments when it was so bad i had to change the channel.Fans of sands are better off watching a re-run of room with a view.
3,As far as modern jazz piano/bass duos - this recording is rather tame.,"I am challenged by Bill Evans' electric keyboard playing on 'Intuition' - five tracks of the recording's eight - too many tracks to avoid for me so my advice - avoid this disc! The CD by Bill Evans and Eddie Gomez which I like and heartily recommend is their collaboration onMontreaux, Vol. 3!"
2,Cruciflicks' Review,"""Think of every negative stereotype you possibly can for Christian filmmaking. No matter what you've got in mind, I guarantee you that ""The Wager"" has got it...and then some."" -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder""But my biggest criticism of ""The Wager"" is how unbelievable it became as it went along. It's not just that it isn't relatable to me, but there's probably about a .5% chance of those circumstances having that result in real life."" -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-FounderFor the rest of our reviews on this and other faith based films, check out cruciflicks.net where ""We don't judge people, just the movies they make."""
4,Good Movie About Conflicting Moral Values.,"This story was obviously based on the book of Job, but it also brings up the old Bible passage, ""What is a man's life if he should gain the whole world and lose his soul."" I'm not a big fan of Randy Travis' music, but thought he did a pretty good job as Michael Steel, the blockbuster movie star with the wholesome image whose world falls apart as the devil and God place a bet on his soul. You really feel sorry for him as the viewer, because you know he didn't do anything wrong, and just when you think all is lost, God turns everything around in the end, although he has been reaching out to Michael all along. It doesn't hit you over the head with too much preachiness like The Encounter, so more secularly based people are likely to warm up to it too, and it still gets a very clear message across about doing the right thing. An enjoyable, clean cut experience."
3,The Wager,"Randy Travis plays Michael Steele, an Oscar nominated movie star with some personal problems. He doesn't get along with the director of the movie he's working on, his wife has just handed him divorce papers, and soon, another scandal hits him, shattering his image.Based on thea book by Bill Myers, ""The Wager"" is a Christian themed film, although this theme is not as overt as in some other Christian movies. Because of this, it may appeal to a wider non-Christian audience but may also disappoint some Christian viewers expecting a clear evangelical message. The story itself is quite ordinary. It's not bad but also not very inspired or interesting.""The Wager"" is a watchable movie and a decent way to kill 80 minutes but it's not great or worth spending a lot of money on."
1,Sorry - this is really bad,I was so looking forward to seeing this. I had watched an interview with Candace Cameron Bure and how it was a faith based movie. I cringed so many times watching it as it is so bad. I wish I could say something positive. It reminded me of the awful cheesy Christian movies they made back in the '70's. I asked a friend to watch it and tell me what she thought. She said she only got through half the movie and just couldn't take it anymore. We desperately need more Christian movies with stars - but they must be of quality. Hope to see more Michael Landon Jr. movies as I have enjoyed them.
2,Not too bad... Pretty good video work,"This is a nice movie. This movie is about how a practical christian can live in all of this world's reality. The story is not superb or exciting, its a medium paced movie. For a christian movie, the quality and the work would be rated excellent. Its a good movie to watch in a cell group or study group."
3,Pretty good...but not your best academy award nominee...,"Good interaction with subjects and great access to a high security prison.... since there is no story you just kind of hop from one cell to the next, to the patios, to the kitchen, etc. The building is beautiful for a prison, designed in a renaissance style it has a high tower similar to those cute European villages, but, not much story for that. Most of the content are small conversations with high freaky minded assassins that make you wonder what kind of species is the human being."
2,Outdated,Not a really enlightening documentary. One can see better documentation on Nat Geo or A&E. By no means a shocking expose.
2,Poor song choices,Was not impressed at all with songs on this cd. Have loved this group but was very disappointed the songs and presentation.
5,Kenny Vance is Awesome,"Love this CD, but I love all their CD's. Kenny's falsetto is the best by far and he can hold a note better than anyone I've heard. The melody of the Planotones can't be beat. I've seen them in concert many times and am just so glad they are still singing doo wop. You can tell they enjoy performing as much as their fans enjoy listening. What I love is that Kenny is so humble but is so talented."
2,a disappoitment,I enjoy their performances but found bothe song selection (subjective) and technical quality a little substandadr. Some songs you can barely hear the group.
4,must own for the collectiblity of the bonus track plus not a bad cd too!,this version is loaded down with bonus tracks the best being we're a happy family from the ramones and 8 other collectible bonus tracks very rare each one and even it this cd is not top 10 matterial it's still very good anthrax. get it if you can rare find 9 bonus tracks/2 cds/limited edition release! hint worth money if nothing else.
2,Poor Quality Print,The movie was fine however the quality of the picture was poor. I was disapointed because I expected better. I paid way too much for a very bad print. Whoever copied this print came right off of TCM. Half way through a TCM logo appears. This is like a bootleg copy.
5,Book very interesting,"Buy it for a course of the University, the content of the book is very interesting, it becomes trained the process that you follow the teams of high acting."
1,Wilbur de Paris At Symphony Hall/Marchin' and Swingin',"These two albums are typical of this wonderful, sadly neglected and overlooked band. Wilbur's arrangements are superb throughout and his brother Sidney's trumpet/cornet solos are second to none; just try 'Martinique' (on ""M & S"") or ""Majorca"" (Symphony Hall) if you don't believe me. As the latter is a recorded concert (""Live"", in modern jargon - so what was he in the recording studio?), the audience's reaction to his first entry says it all."
1,My choice,Who is to say if vitamin therapy will or will not cure illness. I still reserve the right to choose my own medicine thank you! If I decide that eating worms in the garden will make me feel better I don't need condesending pseudo-medical experts running around trying to make eating worms illegal.
4,Cute book to share with your little-one.,"This is a cute short story that is fun to share with your little boy. Mommy or Daddy can read about how father and son are similar. Simple, easy to follow theme that your little boy will love."
4,"The ""Bible"" of Bills' Football","Buffalonians take their Bills' very seriously. Heck, the Bills aren't just a football team, they're part of the community, part of the family, and they make many of us western New Yorkers proud. Truly devout fans often refer to themselves as ""Disciples."" And in my family, we like to call ""Relentless"" the ""Bible."" It is the ultimate in Bills' info and history, overloading you with stats and quotes from the team's very inception. Sal Maiorana -- a life long fan -- and excellent writer I might add, left no Bills' game, touchdown, tackle or happening unturned in this very thorough and entertaining historical documentary of our heros."
5,USA made quality,As any real tool guy knows you can not go wrong with any klein product. USA made. There is a reason electricians have been using these for years.
3,get the osorio,"I bought this mainly for the Handel Variations. It must be one of the most difficult things to play live. She gives it her all and comes up lacking. But her Bach is great as usual.I agree with the reviewer about the Ax and the Cliburn Handel Variations. Worth owning both of them, but if you want THE superior reading get the Osorio on some budget label. The best."
4,Great time saver,"As a volunteer at a Catholic church in Chicago, I need to service up to 20 window units each year. This tight sealing line tap valve makes evaluating a unit quick and easy. Many of the units that are donated have dirty condensor coils, bad fan motors or broken hardware on them. This tap valve takes the guesswork out of recycling vs re-using."
1,Nothing to see here,"There appears to be a growing undergroud network of wanna-be experts, authors, and speakers pulling together to hype themselves up with 5 star reviews. I can't take this bunch of cheeseballs seriously and you shouldn't either.There's just nothing worthwile here that hasn't been seen before.I wish Amazon would do something to crack down on these padded reviews."
1,Slick and vapid ... maybe I read a different book?,"I've just finished Book Yourself Solid, and then checked out the reviews on Amazon. My jaw dropped. I can't believe people gave this book 4-5 stars. I started to wonder if I was reading the same book as these folks. A slick sales job promoting many of his products and websites under the guise of offering information, the only person this book helps is Michael Port.Michael misses at a number of levels in this book by either going too deep into information (""have a firm handshake""; ""have a website"". Wow! Thanks, Mike), or by not going deep enough ""have an affiliate program."")Unless you're intested in lining Michael's pockets with more money, I would recommend avoiding this book. Or, if you use Michael's approach as a template for your own business, that'll work too ... if you can avoid the pitfalls."
5,Cut the [...] Business Coaching,"I've been a colleague, client and vendor for Michael and he is absolutely a superstar consultant. And he has heart - LOTS of heart. Book Yourself Solid can take any professional through a complete process of purposefully building a brand, a business and a future. It is a comprehensive, extensive, exhaustive look at what makes service professionals succeed online. It's the real deal - with real advice - and real tips, tools and techniques to help your business explode. You must buy it."
5,"A refreshing little tonic for someone who needs to increase their sales but absolutely hates to ""sell.""","""Book Yourself Solid"" was a great read! And it's turned into a wonderful resource. I really (really) hate selling -- I'm a copywriter and editor after all, not some outgoing, smooth-talkin' sales person. But, after just one read of the book, I am poised to get more business than I can handle. I've already implemented many of Port's suggestions (I especially like all the groovy and easy-to-make-happen website marketing strategies) and am ready to move on to more, while my phone continues to ring. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to increase their business without feeling like a ""just in it for the money"" marketer."
4,It gets even easier when you listen instead of reading,"Great book, great training course and now a great way to obtain and review the information. Michael's approach to marketing is simple and generous.It is about building trust and Michael's own integrity comes though with his voice.There was one small downside in that I found the interruptions while he sent me to the exercises irritating but I bought the product to revise the content so I may not have been the main target. The packaging is practical and easy to use.This is a well worthwhile addition to my library and Michael's warmth and generosity comes clearly through."
5,Great Book - The one to Buy!!!!,Excellent Book ... packed full of all the right information for the Consultant/Trainer/Coach/Business Person/Marketing. He will show you step by step how to get Booked Solid - It works!Michael's website is also full of free goodies ... I download his teleseminars and listen to them in my car each week (www.thinkbigrevolution.com) - Great stuff - awesome guests!So glad I bought this book!
5,A Step-by-Step Guide to Getting More Clients,"Michael and his support team have done it again. I'm always totally impressed with everything he does but this time he has gathered everything necessary to get your client base kicked into high gear.I wish I had had this book when I started 5 years ago. I believe it has everything you need to know to get started in marketing your fabulous coaching skills. Coaches are often the best kept secret because they are afraid to market themselves --the techniques in Book Yourself Solid give you plenty of techniques to educate your target audience so they want more of you!

3,An easy know how guide to making a succesful buisness.,"Port gives you all the information that you need to know about boosting sales, and maximising profit margins. He gives the low down on whats hot, and whats not, in the world of setting up your very own buisness. This book is an influencial guide on how to make a succesful buiseness, with this practicaly fool proof method of creating you a very tidy sum of money.Overall i really enjoyed this book, even at it's worst, as it can really boost you and give you that extra confidence to set up you own buisness. Even though i do not own a buiseness just yet, i have reccomended this method to loads of my friends,family, you name it, and the've all said it worked or reccomended it to another friend.Sam Worrall rating: 4 stars.P.S, that is supposed to be 4 stars. but i accindently clicked save on 3 stars, but it's actualy meant to be 4."
1,... a disappointment,"Lots of sizzle but no steak. Lost in incomprehensible talk about ""love"" and lots of other new-agey nonsense, this book reads like a transcribed audio ramble. It takes conversational to its ridiculous extremes and tries to make pretty basic marketing tenets sound somehow revolutionary and fresh.Useless exercises, laughable case studies and lots and lots of hype. I'd say it might impress you if you're a newbie, but I think even newbies are better served finding a good, solid book with real information. I say cut to the real deal and go straight to Free Agent Nation (which the author has obviously read) or some of the other fine books offered in this category. Skip this watered-down attempt at a how-to guide."
5,Not the usual snooze-fest business book- A Must Read!,"It comes as no surprise that this one-time actor turned successful business coach and consultant is known as `the guy to call when you are tired of thinking small'. His first book hits a home run! The book is a well-written, easy read, infused with heart and replete with exercises so the reader can readily apply the lessons Port teaches. It is destined to be a reference book that small business owners can pull off the shelf time and again to keep moving their businesses forward.The best part is that it doesn't 'feel' like a business book. It feels like you are chatting with a friend who really cares..."
4,A Refined Way to Do Business,"Michael Port is in the business of helping other business people achieve their true potential. His approach is both a step-by-step tutorial in that process and also an exploration of what actually makes people successful, so the approach is both microcosmically specific and macrocosmically general. Even successful people can benefit from this book, if their current level of success has not reached what they are capable of. Because Michael is successful himself, and those who have followed his advice are as well, his approach has been proven to work. It's already improved my own way of doing business. I recommended it to my business friends, as I recommend it to anyone with a business."
1,Book Yourself Solid,"I found this book to be more on the ""basic"" side for experienced business people. However, I can see how it would be quite beneficial for someone that may not have years of experience and/or who is starting their career or own business endeavor. The chapters on ""referral strategy"" and ""web strategy"" are important since even experienced business people sometimes forget the value of each of these two avenues to business success. While one star is shown, I do believe it merits more than one star, however, I was unable to make that change during the edit stage of this review."
3,"Okay, but not Melora's greatest","The collection has some interesting gems, including This Little Piggy, but otherwise is ""meh, just okay."" I wish Rasputina would have included Heart's Barracuda in the collection."
5,A master piece of the flamenco music and dance.,"This film reveals all the passion and intensity of a culture that express its thoughts and feelings through music and dance. Very well done, and I hope soon I can get a copy of it."
2,"I didn't like this, starting with the rotten title...","OK, so it's a cute title, and in keeping with the rest of the glib titles of Selma Eichler's books. But it telegraphs way too much of the plot! The mystery, at face value, seems to have nothing to do with an affair. The title tells you what to look for.The mystery is too easily solved--there is only one clear solution to it, beginning very early on. So this book is padded with chapter after chapter of Desiree missing the clues, plus a completely annoying chapter in which Desiree looks down her nose at a bridal store employee. Now, this saleswoman is a pain in the posterior, to be sure, but Desiree's barbs are more directed at the size of the saleswoman's own posterior. This from a P.I. who is supposed to be appealing because she is plus-sized? OK, so maybe it's OK to be plus-sized as long as you aren't any bigger than Desiree...whatever size she is...or at least it seemed that Eichler was trying to convey something like that."
5,Outstanding journal,This is def the best running journal ever. I love everything about this book. Will be buying more for presents.
5,Great product!,Arrived on time and in good condition - perfect journal to have when training for races!
5,Runner Journal,Have used this journal religiously for a year. Works great! Bought another one for 2010.
4,"Bought it as a gift for my wife, the runner","My wife likes it, but doesn't love it.What can I say, some gifts are like that."
1,Disappointing.,"This running log was very disappointing in two respects. First, it isn't calendar based so you have to fill in the dates, and even then there's not a space given to record the date for each particular day, only for the week. Secondly, there's simply not nearly enough space for writing comments for each run. I like to really have space to describe the weather, how I felt, how hard I felt I was running, etc. You just don't get it here. I just paid good money for this and find it just isn't very usable for my purposes at least. It's not rocket science to come up with a really nice functional running log- The Compete Runner's Day by Day Log and Calendar had it just right for years until they messed it up this year."
5,Runner's World Training Journal-Great way to track your year and train,"This is the perfect journal for training and running. In 2012 I used the older version to track all of my training up to the Chicago Marathon and it was great for logging total miles/weekly miles and all my races. It is a 52 week journal and you fill in the dates. You open the book, lay it flat and each week spans the two pages. There are nice motivational quotes and tips.I do use an online training tracker with my Garmin, but this allows you to have an accessable tool for planning your weeks and miles . It was particularly useful for me with my desk calendar tracking the 16 week Hal Hogden preparation for a marathon. Recording aches and pains those weeks with over 50 miles is nice to review so you can get a handle on what works best with your body recovery planning after big races.Overall, it is a handy tool and it is pretty cool seeing the miles add up when you get to December."
5,Fantastic Guide,If you are looking for a program to give you that extra edge or just some extra motivation this is a fantastic buy.
1,Too little writing space,I agree with other reviewers about the lack of space to write notes in this edition. The previous edition was a joy to use.
3,Nothing special,"I received this journal for Christmas and can honestly say it's nothing special. Take a look at the ""Search Inside"" function for this book and look at the Excerpt. Basically, it just provides a space for recording information for route, distance, time and a little bit for comments. The tips are nice, but there's really nothing that makes this journal any better than anything else out there."
4,Journal,Training journal bought for my daughter's birthday. Looks llke it has everything she will need to start the new year off.
3,So so,"I wanted to listen to this Various Artist release with an open mind, I thought ""Morrissey, and electronic synths?"" Has to be interesting! Indeed it was interesting to listen to but, just wasnt so great. I felt it lacked transitions, hopefully you will understand what I mean by this. I have already listened to the Blue Skied An' Clear release and i absolutely loved it, I would recommend that compilation to anyone who enjoyed this. Most of the tracks on this compilation didnt really catch my attention, it's alright for backround music i suppose to do homework or just to relax. As the compilation as a whole it is very sluggish and just kinda drags on. Overall I give this compilation a 3. Give it a try if your curious, just don't expect too much."
5,Another good one,"If you've listened to his 'Jazz Around Midnite', you'll definately like this one. It will be a perfect one to share with your love one."
3,May not fit your Singer,"The delivery was prompt, but the listing does not mention that this foot is for an older slant shank singer and will not fit many (if any) newer model singers. The singer store I went to to ask about it said there arent any adapters to make it work. I had to return it."
3,Does the job but I needed to get a shaft attachment.,"I did not realize this wasn't going to fit on the long shaft for my Brother machine, I've been wanting to use it but now I need to find an adapter."
1,Didn't Fit,Didn't fit my singer. I also didn't realize that I could return it and I think I missed the return window.
5,Rolled hem foot for sewing machine,"After watching a video on YouTube, I ordered this attachment for my machine. It was delivered on time and in good condition. I have spent some time practicing how to use it and I'm very pleased with the results. It make a nice even and neat edge on medium to lightweight fabrics."
1,Spellbound,"Spellbound seems to be another weak link in the collection of this series. Although the mystery of the Spellbinder episodes are mildly amusing, the lack of reality is a bit diverting. Though, I have to admit, the action sequences are breathtaking (even though they are animated)."
2,FALLS APART!!!,"I use this product for stained glass, but I am going to replace it. The sleeve CONSTANTLY detaches from the base. Every time I remove the iron from the holder, the sleeve pulls off the base. I have managed to reduce this by bending the metal on the sleeve's joint, but it still works loose. Obviously this is a problem. Not only is it annoying, but I have been burned (luckily, they've only been minor burns). I don't want to glue it as it gets quite hot. On the plus side, since the unit so easily disassembles, it is very easy to transport as it takes up very little room in my bag. (I try to find something positive in everything!:)"
4,Fits like REAL OEM,"I had a rat chew my oem coolant reservoir so i decided to get a new one online. the original factory toyota ones are hard to find or pretty pricy so i decided to go for a generic one at amazon. This reservoir was pretty good but there is only 2 things that i can complain about the tank. The cap does not have a tube that lets air out, and there is no measurements on the side. What i did was hold both tanks from side to side and marked the full line with a sharpie."
5,Awesome,"Thank you US Auto for the part. It is exactly the part that fits my Camry and it arrived in very good condition. Havent installed it yet since Im working on getting other parts for my coolant system so I can have it all done at once, but Im sure that once I get it in it will work perfectly. Also I love how I got this part days before the expected arrival date. If prices are good and need more of those ""rare"" parts I will be looking you up. Thank you! :D"
5,Why Explicit?,JMM is great. His music is inspirational and appropriate for all. Why does his album say explicit on the title?
5,"Amazing CD. It's Christian, why ""Explicit""?","This album has the most amazing song writing I've heard.Also, it's Christian music, why is it listed under ""explicit""?"
1,Anglophone Review,"From an anglophone's point of view this dvd is not worth the purchase. It is basically a gala event honouring Guy Lafleur with musical guests and guest speakers (majority are Francophones). It is not a highlight reel of Guy's greatest moments which is what I expected. In reality, there is about five minutes of some of Guy's goals but mostly people talking about Lafleur and what he meant to them. There were only three english speaking moments ( Wayne Gretzky, Phil Esposito and Frank Mahovolich). So unless you understand french fluently I would not recommend purchasing this dvd."
1,Please!,"I really like HGTV, but this book is not at all what I expected. First, flowers and stripes? No thank you. Second, where's the instructions? I thought this book was going to explain the why's and where's. Third, everything in it reminded me of the '70s. I am very upset that I actually paid full price for this book :("
2,Nothing New,"I enjoy some HGTV shows but unfortunately this book seemed like it was released just to to capitalize on the room makeover bandwagon and not to help the reader. Too bad there was nothing new, practical or original in it.If you are looking for ideas to fix up your home, with useful information, buy another book instead ."
4,Some Very Good Ideas,I am an HGTV addict and thus watch all of the home decorating shows. I found this book to be quite helpful in terms of color coordination and furniture placement. I also got some great ideas and economical solutions for reusing odd and worn furniture pieces.
2,Outdated and Disappointing,"While I did find some valuable tips, most of the rooms were outdated, and overall I was disappointed by this book. Try Trading Spaces' ""Instant Impact"" or Martha Stewart's ""Decorating with Color"" instead."
4,Great Pics Lots of Ideas,This book is filled with so many great pics and ideas that every now and then I pull it out for inspiration to re-do my house. There is so many ideas that over flow from the start. A great book for decorators both novice & professional!
2,Fell apart the first time he wore them,"I purchased these suspenders for my husband as a birthday gift so he would have some fun ones to wear other than his black and beige ones. Unfortunately, the metal clips popped off the first time he put them on, and he said they were hard to adjust as well. I will not be buying this type of suspender for him again."
4,Interesting.,"As a scholar of children's Vietnam War literature, I found this CHILDREN OF THE DRAGON to be extremely interesting. Definitely a different take on the war and the Vietnamese than the normal jingoistic, rah-rah, America-is-always-moral-and-right approach that most books for kids take. This one is definitely worth reading."
3,Good movie,I love this movie. Of course its not even close to be one of Stallone's best movies but it does it for me. Great suspense and great acting by the whole cast. For me this movie is a 3/5.
1,Very Bad Quality Import,This film is not one of Stallone's best. It was made by Universal but they abandoned the product when it came time to distribute it in the US. It was shopped around and released independantly with a changed named from D-Tox to Eye See You. They may have even altered the aspect ratio. The D-Tox import version was said to have the original 2:35 ratio. Unfortunately the item I recieved did not play at all and was returned. It was listed as region A-Blu-ray but I do not believe it was. All I got was the message NO DISC on the LCD screen.
4,Sweet Relief!,"I picked this up while filling my Diflucan prescription in the middle of my first ever yeast infection. I'd been dealing with intense burning and itching for days and was desperate for something to take the edge off while the medication worked. When first applied the area burned moderately for about a minute or two....Then slowly faded away into nothing, taking the original pain with it. After just a few short minutes I no longer felt the awful pain and itching that had been plaguing me for days! I was so relieved I could have cried. Now I can wait comfortably for the medicine to do it's job, instead of writhing on my bed in pain. I would absolutely recommend this."
1,Not Sure Why Is Product is So Popular,"I don't know if this Vagisil product worked for the itch I had or not because something in it set me on fire and I had to immediately wash it off. Frankly, I don't understand why it is so readily available and products like Gyncort(it stops the itch without all the extra crap added to Vagisil) are discontinued. I tend to be A-topic so certain skin products can set off a chain-reaction of itching and burning. And that fragrance--please--it stinks."
3,Judge for yourself,"I give this product a 3 just because I'm not sure rather or not it actually works. I had a very bad allergic reaction to the cream after I applied it, so im unable to judge rather or not it has any soothing affects. I have a lot of skin allergies and if you do too, do an allergy test first!"
5,This Book Really Helped Me Sell,I was making many home made products but getting shy to sell them at Craft Shows and such. This book has experiences of other people like me and how they started making money on doing what they love. Thanks Mabel!
4,2oldfarts,"Both my husband and I like this game in the ""Relaxed"" mode. It calms our senses and you may make other personalized games for yourself or someone else, plus there are plenty of downloads if you want them.If you like this kind of relaxing game-- this is just the ticket.Shirley~"
4,Getting more fish is addictive!,This is a fun mindless but still challenging enough matchup game that allows you to get a new fish for your virtual aquarium at every level. I love seeing and learning about all the different types of fish and a few other fun sea creatures. I hope you too will enjoy adding a ton of fish to your virtual aquarium and kicking back to watch them for awhile. Good for all ages.
4,Very Good,This game will keep you busy for hours. It has 150 different levels that you can play over and over.
3,Dispatches: My review,"The first and last third of the book were the best. The middle section on Khe Sanh became boring after a while. Herr used many military terms that are not known to the common people. He does a wonderful job of making the reader feel like he/she is in Vietnam. His descriptions let you picture the scene, until he goes into military terms."
5,War is hell,"Dispatches is a stirring account of a photo journalist experiences during the Vietnam war. It helps to shed light on the horrible experiences of war, and helps to explain why men sometimes do the most awful things to one another. Having served in the army in the early 1980s I had the opportunity to talk to several men who served in Vietnam. These men deserve so much respect. I feel this book helps to honor our veterans."
1,Jason Blair Herr in Nam,"I'm a Nam vet who read this book carefully just after publication. I made a list of about ten downright silly errors appearing in the book. Although I wasn't a Marine (Herr's on the predominantly jarhead scene), I was with the 1st Cav, the only US outfit that seemed to really impress Herr. In any case, I was looking at an old Phil Caputo interview and Caputo says Herr told him he made up a lot of Dispatches. That's something I can believe. If you smoke less weed and have lots of actual combat experiences, you have a better quality of high punctilio recollections. Lots of wannabees and political-types don't get that. To actually have the background and boldness to question the veracity of a work like this is incomprehensible. Well, I get to do that. There is a bunch of fake malarkey in this book and honest people should not hold it in high esteem."
5,"Of War, and Men.","John LeCarre, said that this was the greatest novel written about war and men. I have to agree; the harrowing grit of each line pulled me from start to finish. This was truly an experience worth the pulling feeling I had from stomach to stern while realizing the subtle ferocity hidden behind each word.I recomend, 'The Short Timers' by Hasford and 'Johnny Got His Gun' by Dalton Trumbo."
2,I just Cant,"Although I have a fascination with history, This book is just impossible to read. I must say i dislike the writing style. He keeps on and on and you dont get much out of it. I can't read pass page 57..."
1,Unreadable gibberish,"I read the great reviews of this book, so I decided to buy it. Bad move!I read the first 50+ pages and could take no more. Herr's writing amounted to incoherent ramblings of free association, presumably induced by one of the more potent illicit drugs - there was no time-line and thus no history as such. To make things worse, his style is pretentious.Perhaps the book gets better further on, but the fist 50+ pages were all I could stand (as I was on vacation).Instead, I read ""A Bright Shing Lie: John Paul Vann"" and Stanley Karnow's ""Vietnam: a History"" -- both great books. There are many other fantastic books out there on Vietnam, such as ""We Were Soldiers Once... and Young"", ""The Killing Zone: My Life in Vietnam"", and ""A Rumor of War"" by Caputo.All of these make Herr's book look like the gibberish it is!"
1,Disgruntled Journalist,"A condesending, snarky, view of the Vietnam war and those who fought it. written in sophomoric prose. Would be popular among those who love Oliver Stone, Peter Arnet, and Dan Rathers."
5,Reads like a movie of Vietnam,"Wow, this book compares favorably with Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried. Michael Herr covered the Vietnam conflict for Esquire Magazine, and this book is like a mamoir covering his frontline impressions of the brutality, the insanity, and the weird excitement and thrill of life-and-death warfare, up close and personal. Herr's shocking honesty when he describes how he actually relishes the `high' of risk and danger is downright scary; I'm glad I'm not married to the guy!There's no preaching in this book; he doesn't have an agenda except to be as authentic in the telling as is possible. Great and engaging dialogue pulls you right into the story and the characters."
5,Herr makes words rain like bullets,"I am not a lover of war books, and would not ordinarily pick up any text primarily about war. But, like others, I was assigned Dispatches in a college class. I love it--it is one of the six or seven books of my life. But it does not seem primarily a book about war as much as it is about language, about the odd languages used by the officers in Vietnam, about the lingos employed by the grunt privates--the entire strange verbiage of a unique time and place. Everyone in love with words should read it."
1,Should Have Read the Reviews Before Buying,"The author displays annoying arrogance, and looses himself in his own convoluted attempt at interesting sentences that actually make no sense. In addition, a heavy one-sided anti-American undertone pervades the book, consistently portraying U.S. soldiers as the shameful bad guys of the story. Too much jargon that does not even appear in Merriam-Webster or other dictionaries. Not worth it. If you want a good Vietnam War book read ""A Rumor of War"" by Philip Caputo."
3,"Insightful, but too disjointed","Perhaps it's just personal taste, but I'm not really a fan of the stream-of-consciousness style of writing. Unfortunately that's what you have here--gobs and gobs of disjointed and hallucinatory images jumbled upon each page. Of course, that may be the entire point of the book--to characterized the Vietnam War itself as one unfocused, muddled mess.The message comes through loud and clear, it's just too bad that Herr's writing style detracts from its impact.If you like this book, try Chicknhawk--a Chopper Pilot's take on Vietnam."
5,Increadible!,"Michael Herr changed the face of journalism forever. The poetic imagery, extremely well done, makes reading about history a completely different thing. When I read the book for the first time, I was completely hooked by the second sentence.People not framiliar with military lingo may come up upon some confusion. There are many abbreviations and terms that Herr expects the reader to understand. Don't let that stop you, you'll learn them soon enough.If I had my say, I'd make every American read this book before graduating high school. After all, people are only people, but history always repeats itself."
5,About as real as it gets,"I was born in 1974, and my impressions of the Vietnam War have generally been shaped by the politcal, emotional baggage left in its wake. People talk about what Vietnam meant, what it was about, why it was right, why it was wrong, but rarely about what it was. This book does just that.With prose that comes at you like it's being fired out of a machine gun, Herr describes the action on the ground as it was: terrifying, brutal, and appalling. But he also writes about the tenderness, brotherhood and compassion that war bred between men who would have otherwise never met.This is a powerful, important book that anyone who wants to understand Vietnam as an experience should read."
4,Tom Wolfe in Vietnam?,"Cool, coolness, and the countenance to do it. If you like Hunter S. Thompson's 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' or any of Tom Wolfe's early work, e.g. 'The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test', this is your book describing the experience that affected an entire American generation. Herr's work on Vietnam is seminal. As the co-writer of screenplays for both Coppola's ' Apocalypse Now' and Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', Herr provides the 'real deal' from the trenches of the Vietnam experience. Not being a participant but rather a correspondent during the Vietnam War, he provides an objective, accurate and colorful account of the US involvment in Vietnam and more importantly a glance at the true psyche of the American warrior in Southeast Asia. Also recommended: A Rumor of War - Philip Caputo"
4,A must read in understanding the Vietnam War,"This novel has been both praised and criticised by reviewers and readers. Some doubt that the writers experience encompass the grunt experience, but as the corresepondents experience it is second to non. Well written and realistically gruesome at times, Herr will stand as one of the most eloquent and discussed authors to come out of the war. Patches Of Fire, By Albert French, is the best novel about vietnam i have read, and will follow Herr's Dispatches in becoming a clasic."
1,A Book (a.k.a a run on sentence),"This book is tortorous to read. I'm reading it for a class i currently have and i have to say i'm probably never going to pick it up agian. the whole book is like one big run on sentence with small breaks now and then. its got no order, i feel like it jumps around. not a good read. I'd discourage anyone from buying it. unless you like run on sentences."
5,Going on 5 years of using this product--not pregnant yet!,"I really have been using this product (or the GYNOL 11 extra) for almost 5 years. I use it with a diaphragm. We have not been pregnant yet, which is my goal, so I am very pleased and highly recommend the product. It has no hormones and no odor."
1,Shipping's more than item!,Don't buy this item from this seller; the shipping's higher than the cost of the item.
3,Do not use for going down on someone,"Clear, very wet, slightly sticky.Tastes absolutely horrible. Bitter and chemical-y. If you want help keeping your mouth from drying out during head, you'll probably prefer a flavored product."
4,Great workout,"I love Christi Taylor's routines. This is one of my favorites. It took several times to get the moves but, with the help of her Move Master section, it was quite doable. I also enjoy most of the add-on work-out routines. The only negative is the cool down. It could be more interesting.I haven't done the floor routine, yet, because I'm more of a step aerobics person, but I would highly recommend this workout."
4,"Useful Information, but repetitive writing","This is a very good and thorough book. Seyhun addresses many different ways in which you can gain information from insider trading. He is incredibly thorough. That brings me to the major problem with the book--Seyhun is quite repetitive. The different chapters deal with different aspects of insider trading (for example, the size of the trades, who is making the trades, how many insiders are trading). Each chapter has the same structure. Much of the prose seems to be re-used across chapters as well. This is best dealt with by skimming over some of the repetitive parts while paying close attention to the graphs and tables. A second thing about the book is that Seyhun uses tests of his hypotheses that non-statisticians can understand. This improves readability but makes the book longer (and more frustrating for statisticians)."
2,Giant Shark? Look quick.,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie and that's what I got. Oh, there are 5 very attractive Japanese models in bikinis frolicking on a beach in Okinawa with dialog and a plot that makes Jackass look like Proust. If you wait long enough there are about 7 total seconds of low-level CGI giant shark scenes (yes, that is plural - scenes). Apparently the backwoods island boys are sacrificing attractive tourists to their shark-god while leaving videotapes lying around showing previous victims displaying an awesome amount of bimbo-age. As a trained zoologist, I can confirm that all the women are certainly mammals, boy are they. Sad, just sad."
1,Worst shark movie ever!!!,"Not even worth my time to talk about. Please, I beg of you, do not waste your time or money. Everyone involved in this piece of crap should be ashamed. Avoid this like you would poison. Not even worth half a star."
1,"Good seller, terrible shoe","I recently purchased this item, and after wearing it for a few days I feel compelled to turn away any other potential buyers. Simply, the material of the shoe (canvas) is extremely uncomfortable. No exaggeration, the both backs of my heels are bleeding from the calyces's, and my pinky-toes both have blisters on the outer skin. The material of the shoe is very rough and irritating."
5,Unbreakable!,"This is the best ball for any high energy, big chewing dog! Our lab finds this ball so enjoyable, we bought another one in a different size. His mouth fits in the hole- large enough to carry it around the yard & entertain himself. Worth the money for a ball that is unbreakable!"
1,This is a dangerous play toy,"I bought the teaser ball for my 100 pound german shepherd. It was to replace a Romp and Roll ball, which my dog LOVES. I figured this ball would be made of rubber. I was wrong. The teaser ball is made of hard plastic. The only way your dog could carry this ball is to grip it at one of the round cut outs on the ball. The edges of the cut outs are sort of sharp. They could easily cut your dog's mouth. DO NOT GET THIS TOY FOR YOUR DOG! IT COULD BREAK ITS TEETH OR CUT ITS MOUTH."
3,Not what I expected,"This toy was not what I expected. It is made of hard plastic, not a material that is ""chewable"" or soft. I thought it was made of the same material that Jolly Balls are made of, but instead it is hard plastic. My dogs don't play with it because they can't ""sink their teeth into it"". It's really loud when it rolls on the floor or my child drops it. It's very durable, but not made of a material that is attrative to dogs."
5,"Finally, something he can't eat!! :)","After reading other reviews I decided I had to try this for my 8 mo. old lab/retriever who eats EVERYTHING. I felt bad that he never had toys to play with because he always devoured them. This is a godsend!!! He played nonstop all afternoon into the evening when I gave it to him. It's only been several days but there are no bites out of it, no cracks, nothing to make me think this will end up in his tummy. Hooray! Highly recommend this to every dog lover!"
5,A guidebook for all lightworkers,"I have kept this book by my bedside for a year. It is my guidebook and inspiration for following my heart and creating my life's work. This book covers every aspect of service, what it is and what it isn't. This is a book for all those who want to make a contribution, who are feeling the pull of their soul, and who want to advance on their spiritual path by serving humanity."
5,Eileen D,This book is very powereful and filled with subject matter to help any true servant come up to and live in their true calling of God. This book will challenge you to be a better child of God and help you understand the bigger picture.
1,correcting the previous misleading reviews,"not one of the other reviews mentioned that this is a religous book. Very dissapointed. ONLY read if you are interested in religion/god. otherwise its a complete waste, as i found out!"
4,"good, dark and good","I actually didn't read the first book, but suprisingly enough I followed along quite well, although sometimes confused, but mostly I got it. I enjoyed this book throughly. With its dark humor and shocking images I reread it time and time again. It dosen't really influence the way you think of god or really pit you against good versus evil. Somehow they blended seemlessly together, while good had a dark side and evil a light. I found it an entrancing book and recommend to anyone...except small childern, weak of stomach, or easily offended people. It's not a book for you if you are one of the three I listed. It's witty and funny, while it does have blood it's more of a shock than a disgust(though there's some of that too). It creates images in your head you never really thought about and shows you the darker, and lighter side to things so diffrent from our normal views."
2,No more please.,"Ugh! After slogging my way through 'City Infernal', why did I think that this book would be any better? Hope springs eternal? Hopes are also dashed. Another sloggest of amateurish writing, contrivances galore, and dialogue from eigth grade creative writing class.To think that trees had to die for this book."
3,I seem to be missing something...,"I just finished reading Infernal Angel, and I'm confused...didn't Lissa, Cassie's sister, turn out to be the character Xeke at the end of City Infernal? What happened to that plot point in this sequel? Did Lee just change his mind about that? Just wondering..."
3,infernal angel,"comical plot that starts slow and then speeds up, i found the description of hell a satire of this planet we live in respect that in hell desires and violence is acted out that we only think in our thoughts on earth. i beleive this book though had weak carry out and the plot got in the way of some of the gore. the writing of edward lee has gotten longer and gore scenes shorter. the book did convey strong visuals but should of left out the political references to 9/11 /the middle east."
4,Great sequel,I enjoyed reading this sequel. Yes it did have some grammer mistakes but finding out what happens to Cassie was well worth it.The action and adventure in the novel was great. Also an other reviewer commented that Lee repeats a small part of City Infernal into this book but thats just to remind the reader about something. Its like experiencing hell all over again. Get this sequel if you have read City Infernal.
1,HELP ME PLEASE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"I just received this book from a book club I am in. I hope this does make me seem stupid, but I can't figure out if this is a series. I just finished Richard Laymon's Beast House series & I made sure to read them in order. I can't figure out if this is the second part to City Infernal and I don't want to read a second part first. The reviews for these books seem the same but nobody has said this is the second part and I also checked his website which also says nothing. I would really appreciate so I can start my book. I am almost finished with the book I am reading now (The Rising) and I would like to be able to start this right after. Thank you"
1,Broken,I have know idea how good it is or even if it works. It arrived with broken mounting brackets. I can't even use it.
2,AWFUL!,"How do you ""re-vamp"" these classics! This grouping of Temps is ok with the inclusion on Eddie Kendricks and the guy who replaced Eddie (Damon) but it ain't working. By now Eddie is a little weary vocally. Overall, this is not worth your money."
2,informations,"please, i want to know the title of the songs. also i want to register myself to you, explain ta me what i have to do. youre faithfully mauro"
4,A patch won't fix everything,"These patches are pretty good and hold up for a good amount of use. I used them to patch the bottom cuff of my jeans, and it is really durable if you wrap the patch around the bottom and adhere to both sides of the patching area. I also used them to patch a knee hole, which works but made that area of the jeans stiff so it looks kind of strange. Overall a good product for squeezing a couple more months/years out of your favorite denims."
5,Very Good,These little wraps are the best. I use them for lemons and limes. My days of picking out seeds are over. They also make a classy presentation at mealtime. Gently rinse out and use over and over again.
5,Little gems!,Our favorite restaurant introduced us to this product. We looked everywhere and finally found it on Amazon. My husband uses the wraps every day and wouldn't be without them. They enable us to squeeze lemons on our fish and salads without dealing with the seeds.
5,Essential Selection For Any Foreigner Video Collection,"This DVD reissue/re-release of the 1991 video comes as a welcome breath of fresh air especially in light of the recent release of the ""Live From Deer Creek"" and ""25th Anniversary All-Access"" DVDs. It's not a concert video but rather a tribute/""get-to-know"" documentary of the original band member line-up that produced ALL the famous Foreigner hits (not the current nostalgia/Vegas lounge act touring as Foreigner in recent years). My only complaint about this video documentary is that there wasn't more of it !"
1,Don't waste your money...,"on this trash!!! This is one of the worst, if not the worst, music DVD's I have ever seen. The sound is horrible (sounds like an AM radio in mono) and most of the footage is grainy and unclear. And they waste movie time by interviewing people like Bud Prager, who is a FORMER manager who was FIRED for stealing money from the band!!!!! Nice, huh? Plus, they are charging $30 for the darn thing!!! I wouldn't pay $3!!!Don't waste your money...If you are into Foreigner and are looking for a good DVD, try Foreigner ""25 All Access Tonight (my favorite) or Foreigner ""Live at Deer Creek"". Both are worth the less than $20 that you will spend on them."
4,Classic footage,The footage in this video comes primarily from 3 shows.There is Dortmund 1981 & California Jam 2 1978.Then there is the show where Lou Gramm is wearing a 'Warehouse New Orleans'shirt. Where & when is that footage from? It looks like it might be from the 'Double Vision' tour in 78.Anybody got any info?
5,Excellent review,"Book arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. Text was a bit wordy in some respects - more like a study, than a documentary - but quite interesting and insightful. Seller is highly recommended."
4,effective like good medicine,"I got this book to help with a term paper. It gives a very detailed description of the SA leadership. However, it is a mountain to climb. You don't read this book as much as you survive it. I think I have read more readable phone books. It got to the point where I thought Campbell was going to separate the SA leaders according to height, weight and favorite colour. Having said all of this, it is a gem for the academic. For the serious student it is a must."
1,CORRIGANVILLE Crashes as a DVD!,"Billed as a total running time of 66 minutes, CORRIGANVILLE The Story of the Ray Corrigan Ranch, only takes up 24 of those sparse minutes. The rest, which the distributor bills as a bonus, is old 1930's and 40's ""B"" western matinee trailers.The footage of Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan taking you on a tour of his theme park/movie ranch, looks like it was produced in the late 1950's and shot on 16mm. However, it has not been restored and for that reason the color is completely washed out and the audio is just as bad. That said, it's great to see the rare historic Corriganville as it used to be, but it's not been presented in the best light for fans who grew up with memories of the days they saw it all first-hand. A more fitting, professional tribute has yet to be done..."
2,before you buy this...,"if you're a Zero Hour fan, chances are you'll buy this even if it gets a bad review. Anyway, Specs is a departure from the perfect harmony Zero Hour style. sure the time signature changes and the chaos of ZH is there, but in disarray. The music is all over the place, it doesn't seem to have any direction. and this gets worse with the addition of Chris Salinas (formerly of Power of Omens) to the mix. Salinas has a strong, powerful voice, but many times sings in a particularily annoying high pitch that doesn't gel with this type of music.also: be prepared to listen to riffs taken straight out of Towers of Avarice and a few snippets from their first and third album too. no keyboards, no atmospheric sound. a big mess.2 stars for having a decent production. (if you haven't listened to any ZH CDs, I recommend any of the first three CDs...3 fantastic masterpieces."
3,Skip this one,"I'm sorry, I don't want to be mean, but this just isn't that good. Why did Duke want to stockpile all of this stuff? I don't feel much of his sensibility through it, and the recording of Sittin' and a Rockin' is downright trivial. The supressed wailing energy is what makes the original such a classic - an amazing Ellingtonian use of understatement, here replaced by ""Funky Jazz"" cliches. And the idea of using organ is potentially a good one, but Wild Bill Davis isn't the man. And Harold Ashby is the wrong choice for All Too Soon - it's OK, but not more. There are things about late Ellington I don't understand, and many of them are included on this disc. For a man who worked so many amazing changes on the blues form, these blues pieces are just simply substandard."
1,What happened to the other reviews?,I notice that the unfavorable reviews by four other people have disappeared and now only one favorable review exists for this book. It is interesting that the favorable review comes from Mr. Nance's sister. What gives Amazon?
3,This is a Honeywell 50100,"The picture is wrong, this is the smallest Enviracaire True HEPA air purifier."
2,Air Purifier,Didn't fully serve the purpose. I'm not sure if it is effective enough. Service of Amazon was good.
3,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this collection. I expected more variety of harp-playing styles (bending acoustic, electric, a couple of harp-solo songs). There's no reason for the chosen Delbert McClinton song to even be on this CD. Paul Butterfield or Magic Dick would have been a much wiser choice. Spend $2 more and get Blues Harp Greats; it's a better collection."
3,Crucial?,"Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty good collection, but crucial? I don't think so. It should be re-named ""A pretty good collection of blues harmonica from a diverse group of cats, ancient and modern"", but of course, the name's too long."
1,???,"THIS SWORD IS NOT ""CARBON STEEL"" AND IS NOT SHARP. ITS A TOY. A CHEAP TOY I MIGHT ADD. It does look pretty though sitting on a stand."
2,Nothing to write about...,"The heroine was hell-bent on revenging the rejection her hometown wrongfully dished out to her as an adolescent because of her mother's behavior. She is an underwear model running from a stalker. She and a friend open an erotica toys and clothing store in her hometown. Her sheriff boyfriend is very tolerant of her scandalous behavior because she is really just a very sexy, nice person. I liked the way she made peace with the members of her hometown, but I didn't like the girls' fixation with the sex toys."
1,"Promised a lot, but scratches off the break","Storyline sounded good when I did a blind order on this DVD, didn't know anyone who had seen it.Not much pool action, all the actors look like they have never held a pool cue before. Pace is slow and the execution is poor. The Hustler is still #1, then I would pick Pool Hall Junkies followed by Color Of Money. Kiss Shot, Stickmen, Shooting Gallery, Baron and the Kid still rank way higher than this movie."
3,its ok but not that good !!,"sorry guys this is not the 5 star masterpeice you are led to beleive, i think its three and a half stars, competent but no more. the whole sounds seems rather too clinical, ok acoustic, but it seems intent on serving up some sterilized koto taking no chances, in short, magic is in short supply, i am far from dismissing it (Zangetsu is a good track with heartfelt vocal) but there is far stronger competition. try 4 lyricchord cds koto consort, koto orchestra and soul of koto vol 1 and 2, and EMI hemispheres cd and you have reached koto heaven"
1,Non-specific Cat Book,"I bought this book from Amazon in good faith that it was specifically about Burmese cats. It is not! It is a book about cats in general, with the only Burmese-specific selling point being all its pretty pictures. And while the pictures are quite nice, I found they alone were not sufficient in replacing actual knowledge about Burmese cats. I wanted to learn about this particular breed, not just read very general cat facts that can easily be found in any sort of cat book. If you're going to buy this book -- don't! You can find alot more good information about Burmese cats (for free) by conducting internet searches."
1,This is just a very basic book about cats,"This is just a generic book about cats, not breed specific, except for the photos. they wrote a cat book template, and just typed in the word ""Burmese"" as opposed to some other breed, whenever applicable. Don't but it if you already know about cats, and are trying to get info on the Burmese."
2,Alarm doesn't work,"We put this on our freezer and even though the temp is well below the temp that should sound the alarm, it keeps going off. We finally turned the alarm off and just use it to monitor the temp."
2,Alarm works but too quietly,The audio portion of this alarm is way too quiet unless you are very close to it. Do not expect it to wake you. The visual part is way to small. The suction cup won't stick top my freezer at all.
2,could be better,no adjustment had to turn alarm off refirerator has to large of swing in temp alarm goes off a lot
2,Didn't work for me,"The thermometer and probe seem to be well made but it didn't work very well with my upright freezer. As others mentioned, the alarm is not loud enough unless you're fairly close to the unit but the biggest problem is the probe wire. It is round, about 2 mm in diameter and my freezer door will not seal tightly around it. Within 2 days, my manual defrost freezer had a block of ice forming where the wire came through the seal due to humid air leakage. I've seen other units that use thinner flat wire which I suspect would work better."
4,Freezer alarm,"Great unit, but the alarm is wimpy. you would never hear it on the second floor of a home if needed. I modified the two CDN units I bought to make them louder. I can now hear them anywere in our home. I may publish this Modification in MAKE magazine if there is any interest."
3,good for temperature reading,works well as a freezer thermometer -but as an alarm it's unsatisfactory as it goes off if the temperature goes below 0* which is a good thing for the freezer and not an alarm problemInstuctions not terribly clear
4,Prevents Meltdown,"I left my freezer's door ajar several days to return to thawed frozen foods. I purchased this and so far so well. Installed easily but the suction cup doesn't adhere well and didn't include the specified Velcro tabs. I also found that my freezer was too cold, turning thermostat down may save me some money"
2,VERY quiet - could barely hear this across the room,This alarm is too quiet to be of any use. The battery door also is extremely flimsy. Spend a bit more and get a good alarm.
3,Good for the price,"The cord on this is pretty short, the suction cup I couldn't get to stick in the freezer, alarm isn't loud. BUT the temperature reading is correct and the alarm does go off when it is suppose to."
4,Works as expected,"A basic and simple freezer alarm. As many people point out, the warning alarm is not particularly loud. Ours is in our garage which we are in and out of every day so we should hear it if there is a problem. The suction cup wouldn't attach until I put it in warm water to wet and soften it. Then it attached without a problem."
4,"The ""alarm"" is a little lame","The thermometer works well. It is easy to install. The alarm sounds like one of those little wrist watch alarms, not even as loud as the ones on most phones. It will get your attention if the room/house is quiet. There are little flashing lights to alarm you as well, but this product is best for someone who observes their freezer every day, as ours is in front of our vehicle in our garage."
2,Not loud enough!,"Great idea and nice package / appearance / price. However, since a lot of freezers are in the garage or basement area, it's just not loud enough!"
5,The range of styles and sounds just blew me away !,"What a collection! It covers about every genre ofharp you could imagine (jazz, Chicago blues,Country blues, Brazilian, straight country, rock,Irish, harmonica group, standards etc.) featuringboth chromatic, diatonic (and some excellentdiatonic being played chromatically).Excellent examples of the many styles, from many ofthe greats of the instrument (some of whom I'dnever heard of). This single CD covers so muchmusical ground it's truly amazing -- and a trueinspiration to any harp player who respects theinstrument.J.J. really outdid himself in finding fabulousexamples of truly great harmonica performancesdemonstrating the range and depth of theinstrument. The fidelity is excellent. Thoroughlyenjoyable and expansive. Highly recommended.Thank you J.J.!! It was obviously a labor of love."
4,Pulsating Sprinkler Review,"This is a very nice sprinkler. This is the first pulsating one I've owned and I like it much better than the oscillating type. The spray pattern seems much better. I'll be ordering more of these in the future if it stands up to my harsh water (very high iron content). It also appears to operate better with lower water pressure than the oscillating type. My only complaint is I would prefer a base type rather than the spike type. Sometimes it's hard to push into the dry ground we've had lately. Still, it's better performance outweighs this slight complaint."
4,Works great,Pros:- Works like a professionally installed sprinkler.- Water flow is smooth and even.Cons:- No instructions manual.- Could not figure out to just stay in the 20 degree range instead of going 360 degrees area.
3,Worked for One Summer,It is so hard to find a pulsating sprinkler that works with low pressure. Read the testimonials on this one which stated that this sprinkler works for my situation but... it did not. Gets stuck in one spot and won't rotate. In the trash they go.
1,RUBBISH!,Don't buy! I got a couple months of occasional use out of this unit and then it quit rotating. I didn't abuse it in any significant fashion. It worked so so prior to that.
4,Get the red title version,"There are basically 2 version of this single, both contain the title track, arco arena (vocal version) and the title track video.The difference is the version with a yellowish tinged cover and 'cake' in red has an extra track in 'meanwhile rick james', which is an excellent bside to compliment the awesome version of arco arena.The basic black and white cover lacks this extra song. So make sure to get the correct version for value for money and a great extra song."

5,"""New York Notes"" the main event here","Of the six Wuorinen CDs I own, this may be my favorite. The title piece is charming, but ""New York Notes"" is a marvel of dense musical textures and surprises. I don't know whether Wuorinen intended this as a paen to the city, but it's easy to see it as the late 20th c. equal of ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" with its own energy and busy, celebratory sound. I can't imagine ever growing tired of it.As a non-musician, I haven't a clue what guides and shapes Wuorinen's music--it's supposedly based on Schoenberg's 12-tone system but is infinitely more enjoyable to my ear, at least. Finally I have to trust my own impressions of its inventiveness, its sense of stucture, its delight in sound and sound combinations. If you're tired of the latter-day sturm und drang that comes so easily to European composers, try the cool delights of Wuorinen. And if you're looking for the best Wuorinen, consider this CD."
3,"Good overview, weak in topographic detail.","I hesitated in purchasing this Atlas since I had looked it over once before and had been unimpressed with its depth. The contours are at too low a resolution to be useful, trails, ridges and many peaks are not named as well as many dirt roads. The urban features are good though and most roads are drawn. What finally convinced me to purchase this Atlas was that it was convenient and nice to have all the islands in one book, instead of juggling multiple topo and sectional maps. The grid and scale systems used, as well as the rulers along the x and y-axes of each page make it easy to estimate distance and find features. The GPS Grids and Recreational Guides are also handy. Overall it is a good purchase but not a complete reference. It is especially weak as a reference for the backcountry traveler since it paints an inaccurate and overly tame picture of the precipitous terrain I, as a resident hiker, have come to love and respect."
1,Hawaii Atlas & Gazetteer,"This particular issue had very old information. A lack of information and Road names and numbers. It is understandable that some roads disappear when there is an eruption.....but.....other roads were drawn incorrectly and out of place. These are roads not affected by the volcano, ocean and etc. These roads are over 150 years old. The layout of this particular Gazetter did not come up as the same quality as my own state gazeter. Some of the roads are in ""Hawaiian"" and were mispelled.This Atlas is/was not worth the cost. You can get local road maps from convenience stores in Hawaii much more accurate."
2,Nearly a lost cause,"This atlas was purchased to ascertain the available dirt 4wd roads on the island of Hawaii. Unfortunately the publishers failed to delineate the difference between a ""Trail"" and a passable dirt road. As such, the atlas was no better than a gas station road map; not really worthless but far short of what was needed.........J.W.M. Schorer, Hansville, WA"
3,Disappointing,"Yes, it has the roads. But I found it very difficult to determine exactly where I was on the map and found myself turning over and over again to the Nelles."
1,Received Money Back,"As I received my money back or in other words reinbursed as I did notreceive this product I can not comment on this product, All I can say isthanks to Amazon in there swift action on getting on to the supplier andtelling them to fix this situation as soon as possible which they did,"
3,"Massive, Myopic","This book has a language all its own, the kind that requires you sit next to a computer with access to all the world's dictionaries just to figure out what Clute is talking about when discussing Flyte AIs vs Jack AIs, or when he describes a starship's bridge displays as ""intagliated."" Once you become used to it, however, the visuals, the textures, the world he's describing become very vivid, very real.However, the ending is straight out of some 1970's ""new wave"" SF, with humans as ""special"" and absurd amounts of sex and anlalochezic profanity replacing a painful creative lacunae as the story draws towards its ending.I suspect this is a book for writers, not readers, of science fiction, a salmagundi of examples, John Clute's notion of ""how some things should be done."" And they're such clinquant examples, it's too bad that there's no real story there to enjoy."
3,My 100-word book review,"Smothered under rich verbal goo is the rather slight story of trader Nathanael Freer, who finds himself on a mission to save the sentient universe (I think.) The author's highly ornamented and baroque descriptions become rather irritating and tend to detract from the storytelling. However, on the plus side there are several very imaginatively depicted aliens, and a space ship inhabited by multitudes of dancing tiles, which house AI personalities that actually seem stronger and more distinct than that of their human associate. If you have the patience (and a good dictionary) Appleseed may just be your kind of book."
1,Squibblest dinsk I non pas beau booko,"John Clute obviously thinks he's James Joyce or at least Anthony Burgess. Well he's not.He's melded, sorry, combined a thin plot and a couple of well worn SF ideas (Look Out ! There's a data plague consuming the galaxy. Wow, there were 'ancients' around before mankind). He's then eaten a thesaurus and run around the kindergarten trying to show off.The result is a boring book which is a chore to read. Half the words in every sentance are arcanely obtuse, the other half are just made up from some dodgy etymological stew pot. And if I can write a sentence like that, I know I don't need Mr Clute to educate me any further."
2,Wanted it to be more than it was,"The book seemed to be going somewhere, and then half way through, I found myself wanting it all to be over. It just did not mesh with its potential.As others have mentioned, the language is definitly not run of the mill. I found I had to skim more than read, and not concentrate on any individual word or phrase, in order to grasp the concepts.I would be intrigued to see other books set in the same universe, but following a more interesting story line. So much potential, but for me, it fell far short."
1,Waste of time,"This was a frustrating novel to read. It was a chore working through the verbose and convoluted language. You certainly get the impression that the characters are living in a completely different time and place, but the author barely gives any real explanations for the reader trying to envision the settings. It constantly left me scratching my head and I didn't find it the least bit witty or entertaining. Most readers will want to stay away from this one."
1,Don't waste your money or time.,"This was a truly amazing waste of energy. Clute really thinks a lot of his writing style, but it makes me nauseous even still just thinking about it. I've never read anything so ""descriptive"" and yet so completely and utterly abstruse. There's a big word for ya, John. It means unnecessarily obscure, as in, sometimes I would read two or three paragraphs not knowing what the hell was going on, or even if anything was. I am an avid reader of science and science fiction, a big fan of people like William Gibson, Peter Hamilton, and Neal Stephenson. Stick with folks like them if you want to read something really thought provoking and adventurous. Poor Clute should go back to writing reviews."
3,PARTLY INTERESTING PARTLY TEDIOUS,"Glendenning's follows an excellent life of Trollope with a soso effort on another writer who spent a lot of time in both Ireland and England- Jonathan Swift. The book is a curious effort... she calls it a portrait but its more an impressionistic portrait then a realistic biography. She dismisses the standard biographical form with an 8 page summary of Swift's life in chapter one. Her style than is more thematatic than chronological and for the newcomer to Swifts life this is confusing... Stella appears and then disapears for many pages...Glendenning is best discusing Swift's literary life in London from 1710-4 when he hung with Pope and Dr. Arbuthnot. These pages are informative as is the discussion of Swift's relationship with William Temple, his benefactor. Overall, Glendenning's effort is tiresome. She does not appear to have much sustained interest in Swift or to really have enjoyed his books."
4,Well written personal view,"This is no day by day chronicle of a life. Rather, a gerneral view and personal description, 'what Swift is to me'. Once this premise is accepted, the book reads easily, the style is great,the few pictures helpful. The author can be seem to be opinionated or not, but she is always in the background. I had a great time reading this,and I knew very little of Swift beforhand. Now I would like to travel to Dublin, so I guess the book achieved at least something..."
5,More Of the Same,"This is pretty much like the first one, only our blue collar boys are in a different order. Very surprisingly, Jeff Foxworty is not at his best, doing jokes about how some medecines have side effects worse than what the medeine cures. I coulda told ya that, Jeff! But I'm comparing Jeff Foxworthy to all of his earlier stuff, which is kind of unfair, because his earlier stuff was so perfect. The rest of the album is spectacular. ""I Believe"" was saved for the end for a very good reason (It's hilarious!) So, if you liked the first one (In other words, if you are alive), you won't be disappointed with the Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again."
1,embarrassing,"This product is miss represented in the picture. The actual product is about 8 or 10 in across and is VERY cheaply made. I would be afraid to take a drum stick to in, even once. It does have all of the rudiments but the print is so small it is difficult to read from a normal drumming prosition. I might pay $5 for this if I found it at a discount store, and didn't have to pay shipping!!! I got it for my son and the only reason I don't return it is because it isn't even worth the effort. I suppose that he can hang it on his wall."
4,Nice album.,"This may well have been her best recording. I can't understand how this one hasn't made it to cd format as of yet. ""Every Little Bit"" was the jam back in the 80's. Somebody might want to press this one someday soon."
5,saki table looks authentic,"The Carolina Saki table has a real antique Japanese look. It was also easy to assemble, unlike other furniture items I have bought online. Its design is attractive and it is sturdy. I find that it is the perfect size and shape for display of my Japanese bronzes and pottery."
1,Not CTA,"WARNING!!! This is not a CTA product. It is ""Fosmon"". They are selling something else. If you want one, better purchase it at lower price in bargaincell or other store."
4,"Very corny, very sweet, very cute, very formulaic (with one twist), very, very Disney, now also available in widescreen","This little charmer is a by-the-numbers romantic comedy, complete with wacky sidekicks. A budding artist girl meets an art-challenged boy in a college art appreciation class. The girl already has another boy, seemingly perfect, but he isn't what he seems (the twist). The leads are attractively played, the supporting cast characterful, if occasionally a bit over-the-top. Better production values than expected for a made-for-TV movie, set mainly in college, a Border's Bookstore, various art venues, and a few living spaces, with nothing stronger than a swear word, a little beer, and a kiss. If you like the genre, and Disney, it's nicely done.This older DVD release is full screen. There's a newer release, under the titleLove Surreal, in widescreen."
3,This movie was different,This movie had a different twist to it than I was thinking. Don't watch the behind the scenes before watching the movie as it ruins the movie. I think you have to watch the movie twice. Once to see the movie and the second time to see how it plays after you know the secret.
4,Wonderful and sweet,"I wasn't sure about this movie until I saw it on Netflix. It somewhat reminded me of the movie called Drop Dead Fred, only this one is way better and sweeter. It has this vulnerablity, fear of real love, and fear of trust (kind of). I would watch it again. Happy viewing!"
1,HORRIBLE! DOESNT EVEN PLAY!,"Ive purchased this dvd for my wife, and we put it in our dvd player, and it skipped all the way through. wouldnt play even a quarter of the movie. i tried in 2 other dvd players. This will be the last time i every purchase a used item such as dvd or any other content on a cd format."
1,Worth the extra money,"I had purchased the Haynes manual at a local auto parts store earlier. But it was not focused enough on the Cabriolet. This book cost twice as much, it's true, but it covers details in the Cabriolet that were just not available in the other book. So if your time is worth more than 5 bucks an hour you will be ahead paying the extra money."
4,Newbie-friendly,"Not much to say about this book; it's more newbie-friendly then I expected, tells it's information in a structural, correct, way and also supports that with clear pictures, where needed.So, I'm positive about it. Do note, that it doesn't cover the somewhat more recent Golf 1 cabriolets, with for example a 2H-engine. Although, of course, most information applies to them as well."
4,What is up with Divinity?,"Overall this is a pretty great CD. One big exception is the singing on this album. The song ""divinity,"" is a perfect example. The opening of this song is gorgeous, but at about the 3 minute mark there comes this nasal repulsive voice over the track, sucking the beauty straight out of the song. A few others had similarly bad singing but none quite as bad as ""divinity."" I hope that in the future FSOL either sticks to what it does best or gets better vocalists.Tracks 1, 6 and 11 on the first disc are my favorite."
4,Very cool but very dark lenses,These are really cool sunglasses. I could not find anything this style in the stores for the price. The lenses are a mirrorred blue with gun-metal frames. Very cool.My only negative is the lenses are a little too dark for me. But I still wear them and enjoy them. They seem to be sturdy quality.
4,Great sunglasses!,These glasses were great!!! They feel durable and are perfect for the summer time. It completely blocks the sun from your eyes. I was surprised!
1,not well made,"well, let's just say I had them for 2 days and the lense fell out of one. I tried to put it back in and the other one fell out. poorly made. I had to discard them. what's that worth..."
4,Good quality for the Price,"Once you include shipping, the product costs about $10 dollars. I was surprised by the quality of the sunglasses given their price. If you are like me and don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on sunglasses you will either lose or break within a couple months, these are a good option.Pros: 1) Shockingly Dark! So dark in fact, if the sun is not completely out, it can be a little hard to see.2) Solid frame - no worries about bending them out of shape. The frame is very sturdy. Comfortable to wear.Con: 1) The nose piece fell out after about a week. This was easy to replace, but a little disappointing."
1,too good to be truel- expensive & dry,"ive been waiting for a company to come up with this color since max factor went under- i was excited to find this product currently available for purchase and shocked to see it for sale at $20. i was going on vacation and thought i'd ""invest"" in my fav mascara for the color and special treatment. I anxiously awaited its delivery when it arrived, i was excited to try it! took out of it origional package and opened the bottle, removed the wand to find it was dry! :( there was product in the in the bottle, but too dry to coat the wand. i got one, comfortable, coat on- but it's too expensive for the product to be that dry. :("
2,Flaky,"I was a little disappointed in this mascara...color-wise its perfect, I love the auburn and it's perfect for people with red hair. But I don't like the formula at all. Its really flaky and I felt like it was drying my eyes out. And it lengthens lashes but on me at least it was sort of clumpy and fake looking, very obvious that I was wearing mascara. Maybe its just me but I like a more natural look. If you want something light and natural looking I'd recommend Ecco Bella brown mascara."
4,Great product color AUBURN !!!!,"I have always liked Max Factor mascara through out the years , age 58 !! Periodically I have had difficulty finding it in any color !!?? I' am a redhead & the color auburn is excellent for me & I believe it would be for any redhead or strawberry blond !! I have read that Max Factor is not making this product anymore , which is unfortunate !! This product works well it was a little dry but does enhance volume without being clumpy although being on the dry side it did not flake !!?? I will purchase & use until I can no longer find this product !! Max Factor's # 1 5-star quality has always been the applicator brush that I appreciate !! Their mascara formula is the best for me !!!!!!!!!!"
2,Too dry,The tube is almost dry. There wasn't enough liquid so I had to add water! They are supposed to last longer than one month.
3,Fast Runner,"I don't think I'm as art appreciative as most that reviewed this movie. Yes it was very interesting to see how they lived, and it sure made me appreciate where and when I live now. But I was pretty disturbed by it. Glad I did not live then and there. I suppose some things don't change though, such as ""coveting thy neighbors wife"" and murders, even within families. It was very hard to follow the characters and the time spans were tricky. I was glad to see it had a happy ending of sorts. We also did not know how long it was but once we were into it we just had to see how it ended, it had to have a happy ending."
2,Disappointing Film,The buzz surrounding this film is overdone. You do feel as though you're there in the arctic but the plot is claustrophobic and lacks perspective. You could get cabin fever watching this movie so have a backup pick handy!
3,Has its merits but...,"It IS amateur. It is too long. Watching a naked man run across ice and rocks though is enough to warrant a viewing. That ranks as one of the most stunning visuals in cinematic history. It is truly a spellbinding sequence. I didn't care much for the story. It's the scenery and the look of the production that deserve the attention. I marvel that it even got made, but if this is the best ""arctic"" cinema has to offer, then baby, it has a LONG way to go before you see even a trickle of these reaching the masses. Special mention must be made of the picture quality. It is stunning, as it was shot with HD cams. It has some of the clearest blue sky I've ever seen on display, crystalline and sharp."
4,Film Shot So Natural and Real.,"Excellent film of an Alaskan tribe survival in their natural territory. They respect their elders. The eldest son must hunt for food and get along with other tribe's they meet. But some tribes are called ""strangers"". They try to steal someone's dog sled, food or kill for what they want. The Fast Runner can keep it all together. An evil tribe tries to kill by stabbing the tent he and another man is sleeping in. Naked, he escapes and runs for his life and even appears to run on water while enemies fall through. This film, shot on video, also deals with evil spirits, love, death and leadership. But mostly, the family stays together no matter what. There are scenes of full frontal male nudity, female nudity, sex and simulated violence."
3,Very long,"And somewhat confusing. I know this sounds terrible, but for the first hour or so, I didn't really know what was going on, because I kept getting the characters all mixed up. This is actually kind of a Shakespearean-type story. It's interesting by virtue of being exposed to a completely different culture and way of life, but it got boring when it entered into it's THIRD HOUR.My advice: read a synopsis of the plot before you start it, and take an intermission halfway through!"
5,Great authentic movie,"This is a magnificent Inuit movie. I'm glad it made its way to the States. The movie is authentic, which means many of us will have to read subtitles, but you get to hear the musical tones of the true Inuit voice. Absolutely loved it!Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"
4,This film draws you in...,"...and keeps you intrigued, hoping that somehow good will conquer evil. The acting is convincing, despite the inexperienced players. And the setting is amazing, evoking the isolation and the frigid temperatures perfectly. One thing to note though, is that you might benefit from reviewing the legend first (this is an option on the bonus features of the DVD). I read it after watching the movie and was able to better understand some of the subtleties of the story."
3,"Good movie, but some of the music is a joke!","This is an interesting film about a nomadic group of Inuit (eskimos) who have a curse on their community after a shaman visited them. Later, Atanarjut, comes into the spotlight and falls in love with a young woman who is betrothed to someone else. The two men fight over the woman as a result.While it is a good movie, some of the music has didgeridoos in it. Although I like that kind of music, it is wholly innappropriate to have Australian Aboriginal music in a movie about Eskimos. What was Chris Crilly thinking?!It is compenstaed with traditional Inuit chanting though.Also if you have a lot more interest in the film, there is a special edition available on DVD in Canada with scenes cut form the US release"
5,An excellent film,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and was not bothered at all by the length (about 3 hours). Not only was it fascinating because of the story, but I learned a great deal about the Inuit culture as well. I recommend it highly, but not for young children. They would probably be bored because it is not totally action-packed, and the parents would go crazy trying to read all the subtitles to them! I hope to purchse the dvd soon!"
5,"Atanarjuat is Inspiring, Aboriginal, and Empowering!","I love this movie because it is a masterpiece. I enjoyed the Arctic scenery and the display of the Inuit culture. This movie portrays tribal people in a realistic and dignified manner. I liked the storyline, music, and cinematagraphy.I am going to see it again on the Big Screen before it is removed from theatres and buy it on DVD when it comes out because it is worth it. I hope those of you that liked this movie will do the same and give your financial support to tribal movies made by tribal peoples who are trying to empower and enlighten us to tribal cultures and issues that affect them."
2,There are better choices,"The frame construction of this guitar is good, but there's almost no ability to evn come close to tuning this guitar. It comes with an extra string, which i good, but the problem is that we've already broken 2 of them in less than 2 weeks."
3,Good for awhile,"I bought this for my three year old niece. She absolutley loves it, however the strings came loose only after playing with it a couple of times. It has the ability to tighten the strings, but they come loose again very quickly. But she loves it, so it was worth it."
3,eh....,"Was disapointed in craftsmanship, but seller offered a prompt refund if I removed my feedback. It worked for me. It's a cute guitar, but you can do better in a retail store I think. (no shipping)Comes in a cheapy red plastic bag case......cute toy, but that's all."
4,Great music--poor quality recording!,"These orchestral suites by Handel are hard to find. I have a cassette tape of them conducted by Yo Yo Mah but I can't find any CD of this recording. I feel a little abashed about liking this music so much because it employs a larger orchestra than Handel ever dreamed of--they're a bit over the top. But I really like them, especially ""Gods Go A'Begging."" This recording, however, is very old and sounds like a 78rpm record. I give it 4 stars simply because this music is hard to find."
5,Michigan Hockey - Blue Ice,"I have become a fan of John Bacon due to the style of his commentary. The ""Blue Ice"" history book about Michigan Hockey is easy to read and enjoyable. Bacon presents a series of stories, page after page. He avoids writing in classic ""hisory book"" style by taking relevant ideas from the beginning to the end rather than trying to tell the whole story chronlogically. He did a huge amount of research and created a wonderful summary of decades of athletic excellence and down times in between. The is a great book for Michigan sports fans and for hockey fans from anywhere."
4,Fun for the Family,"Join Maggie and raccoon puppet, Jackson, as they make characters and props for their stories and then act them out. Super cute. My kids, aged 7 and 5, male and female, absolutely love these videos.The Fairy Tales video is especially cute with three stories of princesses and princes."
4,"Not perfect, but it will do!","My last tub pillow finally got too used to keep, even after repeated launderings. It has been a long road to find a tub pillow to replace it....I stumbled upon this one and it is a good enough replacement, tho not perfect. It is a bit too bouyant, so not as comfortable as the last one I had (can't find an exact replacement for that one..it was the round bolster type). I do like the look of this one and the suction cups work well. It is not quite as soft as I would like, but it does the trick. A HUGE plus that you can remove the cover and launder it. Will continue to look for the old style one I had...."
4,Comfy little pillow,"I've had this pillow for a few months now. It is holding up well, not losing air. I have taken the cover off once, and washed it. My water here in Chicago is hard and the cover is getting orangey from that, but washing it is not making it bright white. I may try bleach next time, and heaven knows what will happen. Overall, like using it, but gave up on the suction cups, which didn't hold it in place. I just tuck it behind my head in the tub and after the bath, hang it to dry. It's the best pillow I've used in ages, not plastic junk, the terry cloth is decent quality."
2,"Bath pillow, hoped for more...","I bought this after having bought another inflatable bath pillow, which promptly acquired a hole after 2 weeks of use and I threw out in disgust (in addition to having an inverted suction cup).As a pillow, it IS very comfortable, however, the suction cups are TERRIBLE. Cannot get them to stick to my tub, and it's a fairly standard make. I don't understand why such an important part of the pillow would be so crappy, but I guess you get what you pay for. Hoping someone will make a quality bath pillow someday."
5,Best collection of his out of print albums,"This is an excellent collection of Michael Stearns' earlier work. All pieces on this album have been out of print for years. Finally, they have been re-released on a remastered, two album set along with unreleased tracks. If you are curious about some of his experimental thematic music this is the definitive collection.If you are a fan of Robert Rich, Steve Roach and other ambient New Age Musicians purchase this album. After one relaxing, listen you can hear one of the pioneers of ambient music at his best."
2,Disappointed,"I know this is a pretty inexpensive CD, but I am still disappointed. There are only 23 minutes of music, and all the songs are in mono with very mediocre sound quality. Are any of the Chiffons CDs in stereo??"
4,"Clean, simple ,reliable","Lightweight easy to use. A must have for any hardwood installer , professional or DIY.Delivery was prompt and on time. Its all good!Chris"
5,Jazz Singer And Then Some,Sheila Jordan has been known as a jazz singer for a very long time. She sings like nobody else and yet she goes back to the days when Charlie Parker encouraged her to continue singing the way that she did. Her phrasing and way with words is a very different experience from most so called jazz singers as she does not sound like anyone else. This is one of her remarkable cds and there are many more but her very early cd called 'SHEIlA' with just Arild Anderson on bass is a masterpiece. She cannot be compared to anyone else and 'Little Song' is an excellent cd. And then purchase 'Sheila' and you will appreciate her all the more.
5,Better than the 3rd season!,"Was eager to get my hands on this season, well worth buying! Video quality is excellent (it's a cartoon so it can't be too bad) and audio is I would say is decent"
5,love this show,Love this show! I really liked Hanks new look but wish they would keep him like that.Overall this wasn't the best season by far but still has lots of potential.
4,"Great show, lousy commentaries","Still a very good show despite the decision to move Brock out of the household. 21 continues to steal the show. However, the commentary tracks on this season are among the worst ever, with rarely five minutes per episode spent discussing the show. Mostly the creators just yell-talk at each other about random things, and rue for a moment or two about how scenes they meant to talk about already went past. It gets old. (Maybe if they revisit the show in a few years, when the caffeine wears off, they can record new commentary tracks and talk about their choices for the characters' arcs this season.)"
2,Dismay over lack of episodes,"Where as the first three DVD sets had their entire seasons packaged together, this one only had half. It would have been nice if I could have gotten the entire fourth season."
5,Boom Yummy,"Venture Bros Season 4 V2 is simply better and more from Jackson and Doc.Each season seems to bring more nuanced plot, in depth characters, and tender sub plots from a show that still manages to be, at the core, a 22 minute comedy show.If you're picking this up you've already watched the previous seasons so you have an idea of what you're in for - but it is so much better than you could have imagined.If you're a Venture-enthusiast let me say this - the comedy for this half of the season is astounding, and no it still is barely about the show, but isn't that why we listen to Venture commentary?Pick it up, marathon the show, and eagerly wait for Seasons 5 and 6."
5,Frickin' Awesome,Both Volumes are absolutely hilarious. I laughed my ass off from start to finish. Just when you thought you knew what was going to happen it all changed on you. I hope they keep it up and look forward to more to come.
3,Interesting content but mediocre video quality,"While this set presents plenty of very interesting NASA produced documentaries, its image quality leaves much to be desired. It is understandable that most videos are more than 30 years old, so one can't expect DV like resolutions. However, the image quality in the first 4 discs is at best comparable to a typical VHS tape.The 5th disc -- which covers the ISS and recent shuttle flights such as John Glenn's and Columbia's disaster -- has better video, but it's still similar to a PAL video broadcast. So while the content is unique to DVD series, be aware that the transfer leaves much to be desired. If you're hoping to find high resolution footage of the space vehicles in all their glory (as I was), this shortcoming may be quite disappointing.As an unrelated note, my set had no region encoding. This is reasonable since NASA material is released to the public domain and shouldn't be published in a restricted format."
1,Typical Madacy product...aweful!,"I've bought other Madacy DVD's in the past. Each time, I hoped that the quality would get better...but it never does! I swore after this latest set that I would never buy another Madacy product.You cannot judge the titles on the DVD's...they were produced by NASA in the best quality.. However, the re-recording process they use is really bad. You would think the company could do better if they are going to produce these DVD's in the future. My advice? Look for the titles from other sources. These NASA documentaries are available in much better quality from anybody else!One positive thing about Madacy Video...they use good quality packaging, and DVD disk labels. Too bad thats' as far as their workmanship goes!"
3,Interesting material but horrible quality,"The documentaries are interesting. However, the quality is horrible. The video is grainy and compressed even on the newer documentaries. The colors are faded. The audio sounds like it was played from a Vinyl LP. This is everything you would expect from a Madacy boxed set."
2,Atlas for the Second World War: Europe and the Mediterranean (West Point Military History Series),I thought that the maps would be more detailed then they were. I was disappointed in the book.
3,seems to work a bit,"doesnt really clean anything like magic,,, does remove some unwanted color slightly, its ok for the extremely low price that u pay."
2,50/50,"Did not work as well as id hoped it would. The few marks it got off my suede jacket, it left behind a white residue that wont come off. So i need a cleaning bar to clean up after the cleaning bar? Got 2 stars because there were a couple stains/marks that came up ok with a minimal level of residue. Ill be sucking it up and bringing it in for a pro cleaning."
4,Good Cleaning for Suede,"My suede shoes were starting to turn black, it's a light colored shoes and due to usage they were getting all dirty that a regular brush just couldn't clean.I used the eraser like cleaning bar and the brush it brought back almost the original color and gave it the whole new clean appearance.Pros:- very intuitive to use not complicated- cleans well and does not damage materialCons:- not very easy to use especially if the shoes fabric is very soft making it hard to press on it- The cleaning bar breaks easily while using it"
4,Works for me,It isn't perfect but it cleaned up my suede shoes. The bar does deteriorate a bit when using but this is expected. It does so at a very slow rate. I don't see myself running out of it at any point.
2,Not compatable with colored suede,"Tried this product on my red suede handbag. Not only didn't it erase the dirt built up on the sides, it faded the color so much that I couldn't use it on the front side of the bag. Guess I'll have to spend the $50.00 and have it professionally cleaned!"
4,Good product,"I bought these for my suede chukkas. The suede material was a little more delicate than most, so the bar and brush were a little rough on it. Otherwise, they would be great for any other suede."
5,Compact & Efficient Suede Bar & Brush,My title says it all. Just what I was looking for...Now my favorite pair of suede shoes will continue looking new.
1,Doesn't work!,"I have some suede boots that needed a bit of freshening up, but it did nothing. The bar itself seems like a cheap knock-off of a magic eraser. It falls apart easily, and didn't actually clean any of the dirty spots on my boots, no matter how softly or vigorously I rubbed."
1,Usage? Useless.,"As a professional writer, I'm fairly knowledgeable about everyday usage issues. I rely on a good reference to help me with more arcane usage topics. I've needed to consult this volume about 15 times since I bought it, and it has not discussed a single one of my questions. No exaggeration -- not one! Sadly, the book I used to work with is now out of print.I'm about to toss the American Heritage because I wouldn't even want to donate it to my local library."
5,This book is destined to be a classic!,"This is a wonderful book on selling, destined to be a classic! Selling From The Heart is full of practical, proven techniques and methods that you can use to dramatically increase your sales. It is also easy and fun to read."
1,not very good,I didn't like the book. Poorly written.Not organized. Didn't have any new ideas.Would give it zero stars if possible.
3,Worked with mods,It worked but had to modify it with a knife not sure why it didn't fit my 05 f-350 perfect but made it work
1,false advertising,This case arrived not like displayed on pictures. Clip is different. It is same cheap plastic one like on most of counterfeit products. Do not buy it.
3,Ok holster.,Good holster and serves the purpose. Some inside adhesive will stick to the phone.Overall a good product.
5,Excellent Leather case pouch for Motorola V3 series phones,"AUTHENTIC CELLET BLACK NOBLE LEATHER CASE POUCH for MOTOROLA RAZR V3 / V3i / V3m / V3xx / V3t / V3r / Samsung T809, T629, A707 SYNC, A900 / SANYO 6600 KATANA / KATANA 2, 6650 / LG VX8700 SHINE - CELLET RETAIL PACKAGINGI bought this item after reading all the reviews given on this item so far on this site. I must admit that it stands for true 5 star ratings. Case looks beautiful from outside with black color and inside with the beige color. Material quality and finish of the of the case is good too. My V3 fit right inside without any effort and same is true when I have to take it out. Case comes with two types of clips which is too good for a price that you buy this item for. I searched for similar types of cases elsewhere and could not find a match that I was getting here on amazon. I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for nice and convenient place for their V3."
5,Excellent product,"This small leather phone case is just the right size for razr-type flip phones. I purchased it for my son who loses everything! This case has a strong clip to attach it to a belt or waistband and also s snap piece to attach it to a belt loop. Extremely well-made. The phone can be charged w/o removing the case. Very, very good product."
3,Cellet Case,"The product is very useful; I use it EVERY DAY. However, this is the second Cellet case I have had in the last <year because the leather that covers the clip becomes ""unsewn"" and tears off, and the belt canot slip in. That part of the leather must be strengthened."
4,Good introduction and basic foundation for Statistics,"I hadn't been in a math class in years and had to take Statistics, so I ordered this and found it tremendously helpful. It refreshed basic math terms and such, so it made it easier for me to follow the Statistics textbook. However, the real 'meat' of a basic Statistics course is probability: T square, Chi square, and so on. Everything in a basic course leads up to that and this book really doesn't offer enough on these most important concepts. So its a great introduction but not enough, in and of itself. It will only get you through the beginning of a basic Statistics class- but is still very much worth it as a jump start for rusty students (or anyone afraid of Math) like I was. I don't think I would have done nearly as well without it!"
2,statistical significance and practical significance,"I would love to give the book an unqualified positive review, but there is an issue that would be neglictful to not mention: The book does not distinguish ""statistical significance"" & ""practical importance"".It may appear this criticism is nitpicking, but it is not uncommon for scholars (in the media) to use the word 'significant' in such a way that leads the viewers or readers to think the findings are 'large' or 'important'. By not making this distinction clear, this book takes a chance that additional readers may be similarly mislead.However, in its favor, this book is low-priced and introductory, and for many readers, the issue I mention will not be a big deal."
4,Esta Bien PERRON!...Its awsome I meant!,"It took me forever to look for this one special song called ""Oye Traicionera"" and finally found it in this CD which also has another song which I love called ""Mentirosa""! Both of these songs are sung by the original artists and I must say that is reason enough to buy this album. The other tracks are good but I only got this CD for those two tracks only. Buy this album and I promise you will not regret it. Compralo...Esta bien PERRON!!"
5,Odyssey Ltbxs X Stand,"This stand is very strong and well built , at first I thought I was getting something that was low quality because of the low price... its a great buy.... i would recommed it to my friends ..."
4,great adjustable stand,it arrived on time the box was damadge by shipping the product was in good condition but missing a bolt toe the stand but it was ok to replace the bolt
2,Big stand,"Bought this stand to go in my mini-studio. Almost wanted to return it. It came missing one bolt, no extras. The stand is easy to set up, hence 2 stars, but HUGE. My Akai MPK49 is on it but does not fill the gap so I have to be careful and not knock it over. The legs extend WAY out from the stand are are hard to fit the keyboard on. If you have a HUGE deep keyboard this stand might work. Easy to set up if you have all the parts sent to you, but I would not buy it again. Some things are best not purchased online. The next stand I get I am going where they have my keyboard so I can check out the fit."
4,Its Great,"Durex Play Longer - Desensitizing Lubricant For Men, 1 oz. Its a Great product. And recieved in just a few days."
2,Not 100% Guarantee to work,"This cream might very well work for SOME men, but as far as it goes for me it surely didn't work (very unfortunate). It is definitely worth trying cause it might very well change your sex life for good.It didn't do the trick for me. I made sure I put it at least 10 min before. I tried a few time and didn't work. Once I tried waiting for 15 min before starting the act - still didn't work. It didn't even work when I was alone with myself."
3,Um . . . I dunno,"I'm not sure if this thing works - it seems I've miraculously overcome whatever demons previously haunted me and I haven't really noticed a great difference with this stuff - things have been great either way. Now Durex Performax codoms - those work - but be warned fellas, if you don't need them then they're just part of a recipe for a sore . . .So go forth and make informed decisions in your proceedings - or just do like I did - try different things and then dicover that you're cured!"
1,it doesn't work,"I bought it at ride-aid store. I used it the first time, and I only got a cold feel there, and I wasn't hard as usual. My normal time 2 to 3 minutes still the same. The second time I used it, and I got the same result. The third time I used it. I got the cold feeling, and not hard rock solid feeling as I used to, and I end up with a urine infection. I have used the China Brush. It does what it say, and I last 30 to 45 minutes. China brush burns like hell, so I was looking for something that doesn't give people a burning feeling that last a day.the Foreigner in NYC"
3,State Standards Deluxe,"The product graphics are pretty good as well as the content. The problem that I have found is that if you're a MAC user, you don't have access to all cd help interface. In other words, if you're child has a problem in an area, they should be able to high-light the area and have it explained to them. Does not work on MAC and there is not a site where that you can go to get tech assistance. I defy you to find it! Very frustrating."
2,not worth the $$,Kmart used to sell a mask like this about 5 yrs ago. It was my FAV. mask!!! it was only $6.99 and it was not has hard as this one. The material is soft to the touch but somehow it feels hard on your face. I wont be buying another one. I'm not sure what I'm going to do as all my masks are falling apart. I wouldnt spend the $$ on it. Just an FYI
2,Greart company--replaced what I was originally sent.,"The description of this mask says that it has earplugs and earplug pocket--I received neither. Also, there was supposed to be velcro strap that opened and closed on the side--the one I got closes in the back, so that if you sleep on your back, you definitely feel it. The mask itself works well, keeps all light out, and is very soft and lightweight, so easy to use for travel.UPdated review--January, 2013: this wonderful company sent me a new mask right after they saw my last review, what I was expecting. Love it and especially appreciate the customer service!"
5,Five stars!,I have a very difficult time sleeping and am very sensitive to light. This sleep mask was definitely very helpful! It is super comfortable and lets no light into my eyes. The straps are adjustable and stays secure on my face very well. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.
5,Four Freshmen: Fantastic in Florida!,"This recently issued 1971 live performance by the Four Freshmen is a real find. It's a good fit with two other live CDs -- ""Road Show"" with JuneChristy and Stan Kenton and the ""Live at Butler University"" concert -- that have been around for several years. Ross Barbour, Bob Flanigan, Ken Albers and Bill Comstock are the Freshmen for this 19-tune CD. It's a mix of old stand-bys like ""In This Whole Wide World,"" ""Angel Eyes,"" ""Route 66,"" ""Poinciana,"" ""It's a Blue World,"" ""We'll Be Together Again"" and ""Graduation Day"" with some lesser-sung (by this group) songs like ""Misty Roses,"" ""Bird Avenue"" and ""Come Back to Me."" I suspect this one won't be available long, so order it now."
1,"too much talking, not enough singing",CD has a recorded concert. . .but way too much talking/bantering with audience and each singer. . .a lot of wasted time. . . don't buy it.
3,Audi TT,"OK book nothing new, I was hoping to get some info on tuning the TT but it's very general. A good book if your shopping for your first TT, it talks about the different models."
3,"Useful, informational","Nicely written book. Contains a wealth of knowledge and history on the Audi TT. US buyers beware however, this is a British book and photographs and details as described are the the british version of the TT. Yes, the US market always gets second thought products specially when dealing with cars (they don't think any of us have the savvy or taste level as Europeans) - - did you know the TT came in a Magicians Purple color!? Beautiful, but UK version. (NOT in the book). Otherwise, this contains solid, helpful information that would benefit any TT owner or those (like me) looking to purchase one. Photographs are not as detail oriented as one would expect, this is no replacement for the car brochure. More like a picture book or album with notes."
2,"Ok, but not ""all that""","A ok book for every audi TT fan. But has no real tips and trix on how to make modifications on the TT, or how to maintenance the care. like change oil or stuff like that."
5,Challenge to Honor,"I just finished CHALLENGE TO HONOR with a sense of coming home--home to a great traditional historic romance. Like a favorite dance to a favorite tune. Ms. Blake has never been in better form with her impressive knowledge and use of the setting--New Orleans in 1840. And I do love a carefully written book with good use of vocabulary.Rio is one of those almost infallible heroes that never lets you--or the heroine--down. Those guys are becoming an endangered species. Celina is all a heroine should be--strong, beautiful, and smart. I am looking forward to the next book in this series, DAWN ENCOUNTER. Can't wait to see what Caid is up to."
4,pretty good,"For a historical romance, it was good. The heroine was ok, not annoying. I loved the hero (kind of a Rhett Butler vibe at times). Something about the tall, dark, and handsome swashbuckler always hooks me into a story. And I love revenge novels. He's what gave it 4 stars for me instead of 3.I found the conflict a little silly though. She agrees to have sex with him so he won't kill her brother in a duel? Weak. He wasn't likely to kill him anyway. And the villain was too forced. Of course he'd be fat, old, and disgusting, nothing spells pure evil better!The history and the setting were great though. What could be anymore romantic than antebellum New Orleans?Worth reading if a fluffy romance is what you're looking for. :)"
4,"So hooked the first time, I read the whole series","I read this entire series and like in all my reviews this far, I didnt want it to end!!! This was an amazing historical romance. The idea of Fencing in and of itself is rather romantic to me. Throw in good looking men and a wonderfully written story and this book is definitely a good read. If you like historical romance novels you should read the entire series. Try to start with the first book though b/c it'll make WAY more sence that way. LOL"
5,Very helpful,"This is the most useful commentary of the biblical book of Ecclesiastes that I have found. It's not super detailed or scholarly, but is an excellent layman's commentary which helps you understand many passages of a very difficult book of the Bible."
3,Olivia the Band,"Olivia the Band's debut CD while offering great lyrics and a great message fails to be anything unique. While I would not describe the CD as a disappointment, I certainly wouldn't describe it as impressive either. An average rating for an average CD."
1,Information regarding Latvian's airlines is not CORRECT!!!,"Dear Sir, in your book you mention that in Latvia exist only one scheduled carrier - Air Baltik. In fact they start flight since OCT95 after Latvian Airlines was stopped. But since May 1993 in Latvia exist another scheduled carrier with own AOC and own policy - International regional rotes. We open and build by ourself first route from Riga to Jonkoping - central part of sweden and Riga Billund - Centtral part of Denmark. This route were our own idea and we still operate this route with our own fleet - 3 turbofun Jet engine aircraft - with 30 Y-seats YAK - 40. This routes are very popular and seems that absence of this information in your book is very pitty. FYI only Transeast Airlines ( IATA code T4, 609) is the oldest carrier which performs scheduled flight according to timetable in LATVIA. Why do you ignore our airline ?!!"
4,maximum earle,"I saw Earle on the Jerusalem tour(I think back in february)in Dallas and this cd pretty much captures the sound of his live shows--turn it up loud! That nite in Dallas there was very little political chatter--just 2 1/2 hours of mostly his rock oriented songs-only two acoustic songs. Anyway, as Steve might say, I don't give a F--k about his political views--just a great songwriter and performer who is at full tilt in his career. He takes a bluegrass song like ""Harlan Man"" and turns it into an almost early ""Little Feat"" type rocker. Good album!"
4,Clarification...,"Regarding a reviewer's assessment of my review of this album, I wish to clarify that in no way am I comparing ""John Walker's Blues"" to any of Toby Keith's music... As a die-hard Steve Earle fan who flew all the way from Puerto Rico to Florida just to catch his concert, I am obviously very respectful of his music. I simply consider ""John Walker's"" a very well-intentioned and interesting attempt at explaining a very complicated issue which, ultimately, falls a little short. On the other hand, Mr. Keith's music is, in my opinion, jingoistic and indeed simplistic. My allusion to Keith stems from the fact that at the concert I attended, several people booed Steve's performance of this song, which can only mean that these people were ill-informed or confused about where to pigeon-hole Steve artistically, which is, of course, impossible to do...Thanks for allowing me the chance to clarify this matter."
5,Great book for my 5-year-old nephew!,"My nephew has been obsessed with football from the moment he could grasp a pigskin in his little hands. This book is the perfect combination of picture book and football primer for a 5-year-old. It may also be instructive for people who've always missed several of the more basic aspects of the game. You will know what each player's role is in the game (beyond your basic wide receiver, quarterback, etc), and the key points will be clear. Ahm. Not that you don't already know those things (nudge nudge)."
3,NOT the best Mouse on Mars album ever!,"For me, Mouse on Mars is a DANCE band...the beat is the strongest part of my favorite Mouse on Mars songs. All the blips and bloops, whizzes and rushes are great, they often form, in their layering, interesting melodies and that is what distinguishes the good MOM songs from the rest. But the fact is, they are all overlaid over dancable, often almost-drum-and-bass beats. This album, beginning as it did as a film score, has no rhythm track. It works well as an ambient album, but that is not what I'm looking for when I buy a Mouse on Mars record. For me, the best Mouse on Mars album is still Iaora Tahiti. Oh, and as for the extra track on the CD not on the album version that came out a few years ago... it turns out to be ""Glim"". Which you can get on the Cashe Coeur Naif CD EP. If you're a completist, by all means, get this CD...it's better than Vulvaland! But not their best."
2,did not like this.,"If it is the original music from the Masters that you are looking for, then this is not it for you. The style is bland and I wished that it had kick, as the original interpretations do. I would not suggest this. I wished that I had read reviews before purchasing this."
2,Hallo-wha?,"Let me start by saying I've never listened to Steamroller before picking this up. I am a big fan of Halloween and have quite a collection of music/sound fx so naturally, this was a must buy when I saw it.Strictly from a Halloween fan's point of view, I can't recommend this except maybe for a kids party. The synth on the tracks really removes any spookiness from the tunes and makes them fall short of Halloween-worthiness. Tocatta and Hall of the Mountain King are some of my absolute favorite classical pieces and here they are given a royal treatment...if they were produced on a Commodore 64, or Casio keyboard for you younger folk.The FX disc isn't horrible, but it's below the average generic sound fx you find in the bargain bin. Again, not much scary except for the fact that I spent money on this.If possible, check it out before you buy."
3,Tries to please everyone,"One of the neat things about the holiday of Halloween is that it is so versatile. Where Christmas has a very straightforward story (Santa or Jesus, take your pick), Halloween can be many things. Some people see it as a sort of Mardi Gras atmosphere, where any kind of costumed theme is suitable. Others see it as a dark holiday, only suited gothic castles, zombies, and monsters. Still others celebrate it in the style of gory slasher movies, complete with deranged serial killers and buckets of blood. And then there is the non-scary childrens Halloween, where the ghosts are cute and jack-o-lanterns all have goofy grins.This CD covers all these aspects of Halloween, which virtually garantees that no one will like every song. However, I would suggest that you pick and choose the tracks you like from the CD, as part of your overall Halloween soundtrack. You will probably find at least several tracks you like. And of you like Mannheim Steamroller, you will like most of them."
2,Could have been great but . . .,"As a big Steamroller fan, perhaps my hopes were set a little too high. I envisioned more original music (perhaps a more scarier vibe than the silly one this CD has to it) and maybe a few covered tunes. Chips originals (from the Fresh Aire series)found on this CD outshine the weak efforts put forth on the covered and rearranged tracks. The sound effects disc sets a great(and creepy)mood, that should had been followed through with some new and equally scary compositions.If you're a die hard Mannheim fan (as in 'I just have to own everything Chip puts out') I say go for it. But otherwise spend your Halloween money elsewhere. Overall this is a forced and lazy effort."
1,Disappointing,"My husband & I are big Mannheim Steamroller fans & I love halloween, so was very excited about this. We were quite disappointed. First we think poor taste to put songs from previously released CD's on. We already paid for those once. Second, some of the music was strongly MIDI sounding & kind of obnoxious. Third, the only really halloween sounding song was Toccata; & the arangement (or derangement as Chip Davis said) wasn't that impressive. The rest of the music didn't have much of a halloween feel. Some of the sound effects on the 2nd CD were decent, but definetly not worth the price. Chip Davis may have Christmas in his soul, but he doesn't have a feel for Halloween."
3,"Jack of all trades, master of none",Pretty much sums up this book. It tries to do too much and ends up skimming over the details. I would give it a higher score but it doesn't really do a good job at what it covers and the examples are vague & cumbersome. It feels like the authors are trying too hard. If you're new to Japanese stay away from this.
2,Disappointing,"This video i bought after i watched the Ugly duckling in Disney's timeless tales series ... i always loved the story, but this video was very disappointing ... the kids hated it, they never watch it ... i am glad i did not pay a lot in this video ..."
5,Wonderful childhood memories!,"I have three children 23, 15, and 9. The 23 yr old received this movie originally when he was 5 and it was watched (no exageration) hundreds of times - some days up to 5 times!! LOL He loved it! It was then passed to the middle child - he watched it continuously as well. By the time kid number 3 arrived the movie was worn out and would not play. Her two older brothers told little sis all about the movie and how awesome it was and actually quoted several entire scenes!! She wanted to see it as well. Imagine my joy when I actually had enough brains to search online for it and found it! Same case cover and everything. I thought about getting the DVD but chose the VHS instead because of nostalgia! The movie is going under the Christmas tree this Christmas Eve as a surprise for all 3 kids!!!"
3,Funny read!,This is my second pregnancy and the first time I have read this book. I loved it! I am excited about this upcoming delivery and it was fun reliving the last pregnancy!
1,Sounds forced.,"I suppose she has her bright moments but to me, this whole CD seems to be a bit forced... some nice, pretty young women can manage to sing about hobos, but frankly it made me cringe when I heard it. And ""Hades and Persephone"" sounds like an attempt at an intellectual allusion, a song to prove: I am sophisticated! Her voice doesn't bother me on its own but it's the attitude behind the voice. It sounds put-on.I may be wrong but it seems like she is imitating Joanna Newsom, a brilliant musician with a (curiously similar) childlike voice. I love Joanna's voice but Anais Mitchell's is petty and whining compared to hers! And her poetry, again, seems forced, not herself, like she's trying to be someone else."
2,just ok,"Shanice is a Gifted vocalist,but here She seems to be trying too hard at making a Album that is Modern,but not fully her.Songwriting is ok same thing with the Production.I didn't care for the re-make of Minnie Riperton's ""Loving You"".Her voice is nice,but the wrong material."
4,I LIKE IT,"THE FIRST 2 TO 3 SONGS ON THE CD I REALLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT, OR SHALL I SAY I WASN'T FEELING IT. BUT THE REST I REALLY LIKE SHE GET TO THE POINT OF LETTING EVERYONE KNOW SHE LOVES HER MAN AND NO ONE CAN TAKE THAT AWAY. I GIVE THIS ON 4 STARS"
3,Very powerful voice!,"I bought this CD on the strength of the single, 'Every Woman Dreams'. This song has that old, old school vibe to it. I feel like I am listen to Betty Wright or Natalie Cole! I love this song. I am so surprised at the maturity of Shanice's voice. Shanice sounds wonderful on the rest of the songs but the lyrics are tiresome. I am not hating on her because she has a good husband, but there has to something else to sing about. The maturity in her voice does not match the lyrics. Overall, though, a pleasant CD."
4,Wonderfully Consistent and Beautiful,"I have always liked Shanice but felt she rarely recorded greatsongs on her past albums. When she did two duets with KennyLoggins on his ""Live At The Redwoods"" album, I was so impressedwith her that I knew there was so much more to the talent shepossessed than her labels were daring her to tap into. On thiscd, her true artistry is allowed to shine. From ""Sexy Ways"" on-every track is just a gem. She has a knack for choosing balladsthat have such compelling melody and lyrics to sing. I highlyrecommend this to anyone who wants to hear a complete project.Shanice obviously put a lot of love and care in the executionof this, her best collection of songs to date."
3,This condom worked well. It did the job! ...,"This condom worked well. It did the job! I don't think that the """"ultra sensitive"""" name is truly warranted. It seemed to me that the sensitivity was about the same as other condoms I've used. However, I'd recommend this product."
4,This product fits comfortably. It hardly feels like ...,This product fits comfortably. It hardly feels like it's on. The women love it as well. They love the feel of it and it's so lubricated that it lasts a long time. You guys are gonna love it and your partners will thank you for using it.
4,"Great fit, instructions are not so hot.","Replaced the stereo in a GMC sierra. Comes with all kinds of plastic bit for use over a very broad range of vehicles. Went in pretty easily despite the rather poor instructions. It's been a few weeks since install. So far so good, looks good and no problems to date."
2,Ugh.,"I bought this for a Pioneer receiver in my Grand Am. There are a lot of extra parts you will not need. My beef with this is that there are tabs on the face part of it that have to be broken out. You will see the marks even after you shave it down. It is so gross looking in my car!My receiver was able to be put in through the front or back, but I had to go through the back. There are some extra brackets that snap on to screw the receiver on it so that it does not fall out. Well, this piece of crap was far too narrow with the brackets in. It left me with no choice.I would not recommend a ""one size fits most GM's"" type of product. It is total crap. I wish I would have taken the time to find what I really needed. Mine does not fit or look good AT ALL.Also, this is black plastic. (Duh!) Keep that in mind if you're trying to match your interior."
1,1992 and up GM??? Wouldn't bet on it.,I pretty much had to jerry rig it to fit. it will work temporally. maybe it will fit your car and maybe it won't. pay the 13 bucks for a gamble if your into that kind of thing.. Does not fit 1996 GMC SONOMA!
2,All I Needed Was 2 Pieces of Plastic and 4 Screws,There was way too much plastic in that package. A s it turn out I only nneded two pieces of pastic and 4 screws. This purchase was not worth it. Poor quality and wasted material.
5,I was wrong! This cd is top notch and deserves 5 stars!,"I should have listened to this recording a second time before reviewing it last week. It's true that I was put off a little by the pace the first time I heard it, but a subsequent hearing convinced me that this is one of the very finest Bach recordings I have ever heard. What it has besides skill and taste is character. I expect to play this frequently in the comming months."
5,FASCINATING,"Very thoughtful and deliberate. Beautiful tone and clear polyphonic structure. This is the crystallization of Turek's distinguished insight into Bach's keyboard music that has been built up from long-time study and a number of concerts. I believe Bach himself will surely be fascinated to listen to this interpretation. However, the variation of tempo is a little bit monotonous."
1,"Great Performance, bad CD...",Unfortunately my CD appears to be defective as there is some very audible distortion/noise present in a few of the variations...
5,Bach: Goldberg Variations,"Tureck was the top most pianist especially the way she played Bach. I have several recordings of many Bach's keyboard music, hers are still my most favorite."
2,Boring rhythm,Tureck's rhythm in Bach is boring. A French radio station plays a lot of Bach by Tureck. I always know when it is Tureck playing.
3,"Impressive mix, but TOO much dirty vinyl.","Tracy Young picks a thumping selection of progressive house for this one, including some vocal tracks, but the quality of the disc is terrible. Aside from many of her record having pops and hisses in them, the volume goes up and down, most often BLASTING in when a new track is mixed in, and then suddenly dropping to a much lower volume. This is just a poor, amaturish release from Centaur Music. Track times are:1. Fade (8:12)2. Safe From Harm (6:44)3. Tub (4:03)4. Come Together (6:23)5. Forward (6:56)6. Hungry (5:52)7. The Issue (2:19)8. Break the Cycle (3:44)9. Sweat (5:07)10. Two Months Off (6:05)11. Point of View (4:23)12. Future (4:05)13. Rock 2 the Beat (5:23)14. Truth (4:21)15. Karmasutra (4:41)"
3,decent book at best,"Apparently a reprinted version of Travels in Dictionary Land (if it was different i didn't notice) it gives a good historical and social look at Yemen but mostly in an overly exotic manner. The book and its many anecdotes, however, are very useful as a basis for further research. The chapter on traveling to Socotra is fascinating as well. At times, the reading seemed difficult to an American who is not accustomed to British humor or idioms, but rarely is the meaning lost. While this book is good for light reading or to get an idea of some of the historical, geographical and social aspects of Yemen, the idealistic vision of traditionalism grows tiring. If you're looking for serious commentary on what it is like to live and work as a foreigner in modern day Yemen, look elsewhere."
3,eh,"I suppose I expected a bit more with this book, I mean, it was okay...the author provided a concise conveyance of the history and culture, but I have a hard time believing that the Yemenis are steeped in such ridiculous superstition (mostly because I'm of Yemenite descent myself.) I further was deeply annoyed by his generalist comments not only concerning the Yemeni people, but particularly the Hadramis; for me it bordered on rascist. I also which he spoke more about the people and customs of Socotra, and what the indigenous Socotri language sounded like as opposed to Arabic. But obviously the author loves his adopted homeland or he would've left it a long time ago."
3,Standard Information,Seller was great! Information inside however was redundant to what you already read in magazines.
1,Crush,"Despite the eerie setting of ""Rats"" and ""Terry's Friend Dates a Robot"" and the slight twists in the story of ""Once Burned,"" this movie is probably not the best in the series. The animation is clean and inspiring, but the only real solace for this movie is it's real-life depiction of the shallowness of high school teenagers."
3,Great book ..disappointing CD,"The Pio Peep book is wonderful, with lots & lots of traditional rhymes! However, the English translations are often inaccurate, I imagine for the sake creating an English interpretation that rhymes! The book is also great quality which is something that I have found lacking in children's Spanish books ie paper thickness & texture, print quality & colour intensity etc.The CD is very disappointing. The Spanish songs last a total of 10 minutes followed by the poorly translated english versions. If only the CD featured more Spanish renditions of the wonderful rimas featured within the book!Would I buy it again? Perhaps just the book!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!,This product is so greasy that it does not distribute evenly and if you use a lot then you're totally greasy. A little is too little and a little more is much too much!!!I have curly dry hair and it does nothing for it... what a waste of money - PO!!!
4,Very good product for damaged scalp,"I have been using this product since february 2009. I could not get rid of the sporisis on my scalp even with the dermatologist prescription. Since I've been using this product, my scalp ist retored, NO MORE itchings. In addition the product smells good. The only set back is that it is not light and it makes hair look yellowish. I have to mix it with coconut oil to make it more liquid-like before using it. Nevertheless, I love it!!!!!LoLoMaryland"
4,African American Hair,"I use this for scalp treatment before wrapping my hair at night. I do not distribute this through my entire hair because it is heavy and can make your hair sticky. I have very dry hair and it is a good moisturizer and also helps my itchy scalp. It has a great smell. Other products in my hair regimen: Argan Oil shampoo & conditioner. Ojon hair detangler and Ojon restorative hair treatment. Chi has a good hair sheen spray.For monthly or biweekly hair treatment: Great leave in conditioner: Silicon Mix Intensive Leave in Hair Shine and Conditioner, and good deep conditioner: ""HALKA BABA de CARACOL Intensive Treatment""(used inDominican Hair shops- deep condition every 2 weeks and it works great)."
1,Not What It Seems...,"Despite the '100% Indian Hemp' advertising in large print on the container, and the product description on Amazon's website (""Kuza Indian Hemp is a feather light blend of Indian Hemp, jojoba, Avocado and other light botanical oils""), this product contains many other ingredients (the first of which is petroleum, followed by paraffin wax), including Propyl Paraben and Isopropyl Palmitate. It also lists under 'may contain' the following: D&C Yellow #11 (CI 47000), D&C Red #17 (CI 26100), and D&C Green #6 (CI61565). Regarding the 'may contain' caveat, are we really supposed to believe that a company doesn't know, with certainty, what they are putting in their products? Even when they are toxic dyes?"
4,Must buy for newbies,"If you want a basic introduction to ASP, ATL, COM, MTS and ADO and how to put them together then this is the book for you.When learning how to create an n-tier web application we must all start somewhere - and I would recommend you start here. Once you have experimented with the examples in this book then move onto the more focused books (ASP 3.0, Mastering COM and COM+, ATL Internals, etc).The accompanying CD is ok, but does contain a mistake or two (which you will have to work out) and doesn't always exactly match the code shown in the book - but this should not cause you any problems if you have understood the written text.As this is a basic introduction there are a number of topics it does not cover - OLEDB, threading for example.For me though, this has been the clearest introduction to web programming for c++."
4,Super!,"This is a great record. I've spent many an hour listening to this LP: I put on side A, love it, flip it over, it goes on and on and I have to flip it again. Back and forth. I bought it when it came out, and I must have listened to it twenty times the first week I had it. I put it on again just today, and I must say, it still rocks. On this record you will find, much to your delight, tightly moving three-piece rock instrument arrangments; great vocals, both solo and harmonized; some mid or late twenties guys and their families playing Beatlesesque songs to the tone of ""Paperback Writer""; wherein the songs are exceptionally well composed in many respects. I say, these are talented fellows with an intelligent and pleasing sense of western harmony well applied to the modern rock sound stage. The album has great karma; it will no doubt improve your life. I don't know what the star ratings mean. I want to give it an ""A"". I recommend it to my friends."
5,A winner,"I am a long-time lacto-ovo-vegetarian, and was pondering going vegan. I stumbled across the YouTube videos of the authors' old public access show Post Punk Kitchen, and adored it - I went out and got this book. Every single recipe I have made has been a winner - the scrambled tofu and the samosas are two of my favorite savory recipes, and I love ALL of the cookie recipes. The only spot I have had any trouble with was the carrot muffins - and this may have been my oven's fault more than anything else.HIGHLY recommended, and not just for vegans. The food is truly tasty, and you don't have to tell anyone its vegan. I promise you, they will be too busy enjoying their meal to notice."
4,Isa is Awesome,"Isa Moskowitz is a fabulous vegan chef and these recipes are a testament to her awesomeness. Every recipe I've cooked has turned out great on the first try and there are lots of recipes I still want to test. There are lots of great recipes on Isa's website as well [...]. I only wish I lived in Brooklyn so I could watch her local access cable show.There are two negatives to this cookbook, though. The first is that the prep time and cook time are not listed at the top of each recipe-- you have to read through the text to find that information. If you're looking for something to throw together in a hurry, this can be a problem.The second negative is the same negative I've found in other vegan/vegetarian cookbooks: some of the recipes have lots of ingredients and spices that your average grad student either doesn't have or can't afford. But that's only a problem if you're strapped for cash like me!"
3,Hit or Miss,"While there are some recipes in this book that I love - the carrot cake and the coconut frosting, many others just don't work or are simply, according to my notes, ""Gross! Don't make this again,"" like the vindaloo. It was so acidic I felt like my stomach was going to rot out.And the other thing...and maybe it's just me...""Sammiches""?? Argh! I hate that. It's so dumb. It's not cute. I wouldn't talk to a child like that never mind an adult.I let a friend borrow this book and I secretly hope I never get it back."
2,not for the health conscious,"I am an experienced vegan cook and was very disappointed by this book. Nearly every recipe contains soy, every recipe is fried, baked, broiled, or boiled, and there is heavy use of refined sugar and grains. Frankly a lot of her ideas seemed ripped off from the Moosewood cookbooks.Her claim that these are inexpensive recipes with easy to find ingredients does not ring true to me. Most recipes require a special trip to the health food store, where items are typically rather costly, at least where I live.She does have some clever ways to make omni foods with vegan products, but since I am a vegan for health reasons, I'm not too interested in fake bacon."
5,It was everthing and more,The book was a pleasure to read and use. The recipes are easy to follow and the ingredients can be found at most grocery stores. The transition to changing to a Vegan diet was definitely helped by this cookbook. I am looking forward to using Isa's other cookbooks.
2,Good but not for me as there are way too many ingredients,"These recipes are good but there are so many ingredients and they take a lot of effort to make - I like recipes with only a few key ingredients that are simple and quick - In fairness, this cookbook did not state the recipes were simple."
5,The first vegan cookbook I tried...,"This was a great start for my new life of vegan cooking. I have liked every recipe I've tried from it, and I appreciate how the recipes don't rely on specific name-brand processed ingredients the way many vegan recipes do. Highly recommended - and worth the cost just for the recipe for Ginger-Raisin Bran Muffins, of which I make a batch every week."
3,helpful in a way,"I like the idea of this book, but alot if the recipes are weird and or hard for those of us who dont live near a healthfood store that sells alot of these ""exotic"" ingrediants. basically if you have a vast pantry of stuff from the health food store than you ll like this book. however ALL of the basic ""normal"" recipes were good. like the chocolate chip cookies. everyone likes them. but the Peanut butter cookies did not work out at all. pancakes are awesome, but where on earth to find chickpea flour for the ""fronch toast""???? i cant even find it at the one health food store nearby!"
1,Disappointed,"The recipes in here SOUND delicious but I've made three things and so far one of them was the WORST recipe I have ever made (I am NOT exaggerating) and the other two were not very good either, especially for the number of ingredients they had. I made a recipe from her website and it was pretty good but the cookbook doesn't seem to be nearly as good. Such a disappointment. :("
2,few pictures,"recipes are fine but there are only a few pictures in the middle of the book. Also, no nutritionals in any recipes."
3,Good advice but too much white stuff,Many good recipes. Best for prep tips for using vegan products. Too many recipes use white flour and sugar.
3,"Vegan, yes....but still not my type of vegan foods","Although I looked closely at the recipes, there was only a couple that I wanted to try. I became vegan for health reasons, not ethical ones. This book was full of recipes with processed flour and fake meats & cheeses. Although technically vegan, these are not really the kind of foods I want to eat. If you want recipes with raw & cooked whole foods as close to their natural state as possible, without the addition of processed grains or mangled soy & wheat products that approximate (badly, may I add) animal products, this cookbook may not be for you. I found the layout and type distracting, nay, annoying. I also have no political ties or sympathy to the punk movement, and this cookbook has plenty of that (my own fault - I knew that when I bought it). All in all, these recipes were too much work and not even the kinds of foods I wanted to eat anyway. I returned it to Amazon."
2,Not Great,"I purchased this book because it was recommended by so many vegan sites. However, I haven't been very happy. Although I like the style of the book, there haven't been many recipes that I haven't had to severely tweak to be able to eat. I think part of the problem is that most of the recipes are over spiced. It seems like the author simply opens the spice cabinet and adds several tsp.s here and a couple of tsp.s there and then a Tblsp of this and a Tblsp of that. In the end, there are so many different spices added that the food tastes terrible.However, I must say that the author adds some really nice tips to help make vegan cooking easier for those just starting out in the diet. And there are a few of the recipes that are really good.Overall, not happy with this book."
5,Tasty Eats!,"I absolutely love Vegan With A Vengeance! Every recipe I have tried has been delicious. Thanks to ""Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Toasted Garlic"", I now love these sprouts as opposed to loathing them. Isa's creative recipes will definitely add some spice to your cooking repertoire (whether you're vegan or not!). There's plenty of helpful tips, and the recipes are easy to follow. When I need some new meal ideas, this cookbook is the first place I look!"
5,Just one suggestion,"This is the best Vegan cookbook you can buy. I love the Tempeh sausage... so many wonderful recipes. I have one suggestion, however. I would like to see this cookbook in a ""spiral"" edition with laminated pages. I like cookbooks that lay flat so I can easily follow the recipes. Thank you so much."
5,Best Cookbook Ever,"This cookbook is a must have for anyone interested in a vegan diet. The recipes are simple, there are no salads, and no fake meat products. It is practical and every recipe I have tried is delicious! No ridiculous weird ingredients, everything can be found in your local grocery store. Buy this cookbook!"
4,Amazing!,"I've tried a good deal of the recipes in this book and my family has loved almost all of them. I especially love the cookies and muffins! Some of the meals are a bit too ""hippie"" for my liking but the concepts are great.My only complaint with this authors books is the use of products that are somewhat hard to find (or overly expensive) in rural areas.Overall its an amazing addition to even the non-vegans cook book collection. I love so many of the recipes and use them all the time! It has a great lay-out, nice pictures, its easy to read, and the recipes are practically ""dummy proof""."
4,vegan cooking,pretty good recipes and it is easy to get the ingredients in Oklahoma. Some things in other cook books are not easy to find here. I love the ideas it also gives me tweak other recipes to make them vegan..they give a great list of ingredient substitutions.
5,Isa is a Vegan Baking Goddess,"Isa is a Vegan Baking Goddess! I had almost given up on being able to cook anything that remotely worked like the non-vegan cakes & biscuits I used to make as a child / young woman. But, I have been saved!! Every receipe I've used has worked first time, every time. The Carrot, coconut, maccadamia & ginger cake is fan-bloody-tastic!! The Ginger sparkle cookies & coconut cupcakes with the coconut frosting barely survive the day in our place. And the Chocolate Rum pudding cake nearly sent me into a choco-holic sensory overload.... Oh my God, it was good.If you may never buy another Vegan cookbook again, except for maybe her cupcake book, & some of her other books. Can't wait for our copy of the Veganomicon to arrive!!"
1,"No cheap and delicious recipes, but plenty of author's personal history and politics","I purchased this book for my dairy and egg allergic son, based on the many positive reviews here on amazon, but he didn't like anything I made from this book, not even the breakfast food and desserts. Some recipes were inedible for me and my husband as well (e.g. the super sour ""punk rock"" chickpea gravy and the miso gravy that tasted mostly of cooking wine). Several dishes were expensive and inconvenient to make because they call for uncommon ethnic or health food ingredients not available in my local supermarket. This cookbook has more witty personal anecdotes and social/political commentary than decent recipes or photos of finished dishes. I recommend borrowing a copy if you can or testing recipes from the author's blog first, in reduced portions, before buying."
3,There Must Be Better Books Out There!,"For the most part, this book is a good walk out to the end of the diving board...a good canvas in order to create BETTER recipes. Isa is lacking in the baking department, uses far too much oil and sugar in her cupcake recipes as well as others that are baking kinds of recipes. This was enough to put me off of this particular book.I have several of her other books and find them all to be hit and miss. I like to use her recipes as a starting point for my own ideas.The Kind Diet by Alicia silverstone is a million times a better book."
5,one of my favorites and i just got it!,"this cookbook is easy to read, easy to follow, entertaining, well written, quirky, and most importantly, has consistently delicious recipes.i feel that it's much less preachy than some of the other stuff out there and isa's seemingly not trying to market *herself* as a lot of the other vegan goddesses seem to be doing these days. this cookbook focuses more on the food and for good reason.i just wish i lived in new york so i could watch the show that spawned this fantastic addition to my collection :)the pumkin muffins are dee-licious...the butternut vindaloo is so fun to make and uber aromatic...the book is basically full of recipes i plan to make standards in my kitchen."
4,Snarky and Delish,This was one of the first plant-based cookbooks that purchased. I like Isa's snarkiness - it's entertaining. I've used her recipes often with only a few modifications. She is truly vegan whereas I'm a plant-strong eater and there's a big difference. I usually omit oil from recipes and her desserts aren't necessarily healthy but they are animal free. Great book. Great chef. Lots of fun.
5,My favorite cookbook so far!,"I am not 100% vegan, but I try my best, only eating meat on special occasions such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, and dairy and eggs once or twice a week at the most. But this cookbook has helped a lot to get me to this point. The Fronch Toast is awesome, the Tempeh bacon is to die for. I love the pancake recipies too. My personal copy of this book is now looking pretty dog-eared and the cover is getting kind of ripped up and folded because I use it so much, and have for several years now. If you are trying to cut out some animal products from your diet, especially for breakfast, then this is the best cookbook."
5,Something for everyone!,"This was the first book I bought when I became vegan... and it was the perfect choice. It's loaded with breakfast ideas (or brunch) and other simple, tasty meals. There is such a variety that anyone who is new (or old) to veganism is likely to find a few new favorites!Some of my favorites include: Pumpkin Waffles, Pancakes, Falafel, Tahini Dressing, and Brooklyn Pad Thai."
1,Not for Me,This book was just an extenstion of junk food and not truly delicious food. I was very disappointed with this vegan book. I am a new vegan and had bought Carol Alts Raw Food book this book just didn't compare nutritionally or recipe wise.
5,I'm not vegan and I love this cookbook!,"I love the recipes and the attitude, and my mom does too! Everything tastes good."
3,Fun but Overhyped,"I don't get what all the hype is about with this book. I bought it pretty much solely for the matzoh ball soup recipe, which I am excited to try, but few of the other recipes are really inspiring me to bust out this cookbook. As a vegan for 13 years and avid cook, I think these recipes are overly complicated. Most of the ideas are recycled from other cookbooks I already have, and those recipes are way simpler and already kitchen tested to be delicious. I much prefer ""Garden of Vegan"" by Sarah Kramer and Tanya Barnard. GOV has just has much personality and variety, but the ingredients are simpler and the results are fantastic. VWAV just seems over-complicated to me, and unnecessarily so. I will make the caveat that I haven't made any of these recipes yet, so maybe I'll be wowed when I finally do. This cookbook just doesn't inspire me the way others do."
4,Great for new and improved vegans,"It's a great book to help get you set up in a new or transitioning vegan kitchen. The recipes are yummy and the best part is, even my cat could manage them. She really shows that being a vegan doesn't ave to mean sacrificing flavor."
5,The Title Says It All,"The title really says it all. This book has a lot of delicious recipes that are cheap and call for no animal products. It shows you that vegan food is anything but boring, nor is the author. Isa is entertaining while offering cooking tips for your vegan kitchen. I enjoyed every recipe I have made, usually being surprised at how good the food actually tastes while offering my taste buds something new. I will give a warning on this book. If you find it difficult to get things such as soy or rice milk, tofu, tempeh, etc. in your area then you may wish to skip on getting this book as a lot of the recipes call for such things. Otherwise this is a great cook book to have."
5,"funny , delicious & fun","I am not a cookbook reader, but this one is worth reading just for laughs. she is a kindred spirit who shines right through the recipes. everything i've made is delicious. she takes cooking seriously, but doesn't take herself seriously. perfect combo."
5,One of my favorite cookbooks that I own!!,"This is a great cookbook and a definite must have! I have been vegetarian for 16 years and vegan for 3. Cookbooks for me are important and I read them like a real book- envisioning the finished dish! This book reads well and made my mouth water the whole way through before I even made anything!! Some of my favorite recipes from this book are: Lemon Corn Wafles with Blueberry sauce, White Bean and Roasted Garlic soup, Olive Tomato and Millet stuffed Zucchini, Chickpea and Spinach Curry and the Chocolate Chip Cookies- which no one would EVER KNOW were vegan! If you don't have this book, you are missing out!"
5,A must if you are Vegan,"A must if you are vegan says it all, in this book you will find great recipes that are easy to make and delicious!. I own all her books, I recommend getting them all!"
5,Refreshing,"This is a great cookbook for intermediate cooks. Most of the recipes call for a lot of ingredients, but if you have a well-stocked vegan pantry (the author provides a handy list of suggestions in the beginning) then it's not a problem. I love that there are no faux meat products included in the recipes, the glossy full color photos are gorgeous, and thank you for including pizza but not salad recipes! All the recipes feature thoughtful introductions and helpful tips. Ms. Moskowitz has a lot of experience as a cook and it shows!"
2,Not that great,"I recently bought this book after adopting a vegan lifestyle and reading so many positive reviews on the internet. I am regretting that now. I've only liked 2 recipes out of the many I've made. The other recipes are usually just yuck. Also I find it a more expensive cookbook to use with a family. I love cookbooks and looking through them for some inspiration for a meal but it just doesn't happen with this cookbook. My favorite vegan cookbook so far is Part Time Vegan, the recipes are delicious."
3,Simply not my idea of vegan food,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that if you are eating vegan to achieve a healthy lifestyle, this is not the book for you.Isa uses sugar, white flour and corn oil (among other not-so-healthy ingredients) too liberally. Also, the ingredient list for most of the recipes is just too long for my liking.I would take a plate of lightly steamed broccoli any day over the convoluted, processed dishes conjured up in this book."
4,good,"I just got it and flipped through it - I've only had time to make one recipe and it was quite good. The recipes look like they'll be very good. And they don't look too complicated, which I appreciate because I work and have little time."
3,Not for the health conscious,"This book is a lot of fun for bringing non-veg family and friends over but I don't use it very frequently because it's just not healthy cooking. The author uses a lot of sugar, white flour, and unhealthy oils in her food. The recipes include a lot of baked goods like muffins and scones and not a lot of vegetable centric ones in comparison. The book does give tips on how to make some of these recipes low-fat and/or low-cholesterol but they're still more adaptations of non-vegan food for people who are vegan more for moral reasons than for health."
3,"Decent cookbook, too many meat substitutions","This is an OK cookbook, but definitely didn't live up to the expectations I had from reading other reviews. Many of the recipes have hard-to-find or expensive ingredients. Far too many of them try to replace meat. I would much rather have an entire vegetable-based meal than one that is trying to make up for the fact that there is no meat. No nutritional facts."
4,My favorite non-meat cookbook,I have tried several receipes from this book and my family loved them! Maple & Mustard Glazed Potatos were a huge hit. The Sesame Asparagus and the Roasted Garlic & White Bean Soup are really flavorful - I can't wait to try the rest!
5,"Not Vegans, But We Love It","My husband and I are not vegans, but we absolutely adore this cookbook. Every recipe we have tried has been a huge success, and it's actually getting us to eat animal-free more and more. Some winners in the past few weeks: the pizza dough, the pizza sauce, the white bean-roasted garlic soup, the falafel, the green thai curry, the horseradish and coriander-crusted tofu, and the wasabi mashed potatoes. Not one recipe has failed us. Everything is so yummy and fresh. I highly recommend this cookbook to anyone who wants great-tasting, fun recipes."
1,It couldve been a lot better.,"This book focused a little too much on Tia and Trent. It is supposed to be the book about the Senior Prom and I think all of the senior characters that the previous books were about should have some sort of storyline. Melissa and Will were barely mentioned, and neither were Ken and Maria. I dont think Evan and Jade were even brought up at all.I'm sorry but this series used to be really good, and now i just think it is getting really lame. Sure there were some good parts, but overall, i am not crazy about it.The only part i really liked occured in the last few pages, but i feel that could've even been better.(I'm sure it will make Liz and Conner fans quite happy though)"
3,Boring Prom,"I have to agree that this book was somewhat better than the rest, but I didn't like it enough to give it 5 stars. First this book was about the senior prom, so why did it focus more on Tia and Trent? I think that the author should have included all the characters, I hate to say it but I think that the author has gotten lazy with this series. There was hardly any excitment in this book, and it was mostly kind of depressing because almost all the couples were fighting. There should have been more fun in this book. I can't believe the ideas that Trent came up with to suprise Tia with, and I can't believe what Tia did at the prom. Liz and Jeff are fighting a lot in this book, and I thought that they were mostly a boring couple anyway. I have to admit the ending was quite a surprise, I didn't see that one coming, I hope that a certain brooding character treats the blonde twin better this time."
2,Mediocre,"On paper, this camera should be ideal, however, it fails to live up to its marketing hype: picture quality for outdoor scenic shots is good, but indoor and softer light situations show its limitations. Photo quality is mediocre. The camera also uses batteries rapidly. I would suggest looking at the Canon A510, Sony Cybershot DSC-series, or Kodak Easyshare C-series instead."
2,Not quite easy,"There are types of music that i find comforting to sleep to, or study with, or just keep on. This one scares me while I sleep in the basement at night. I am more fond of the work he has done with other artists. I was disappointed upon the 3rd listening."
4,Nice watch,Very nice watch and very eye-catching. Its big so beware if you don't like a big face on your watch. I wear it for business and workouts it looks good enough to do both. The clasp is funky. Sometimes if you move your wrist just right it will come un-latched but its not a deal killer.
4,Better than I first thought,"I have a few pretty high-end performance watches, and was wary of buying a watch made by a shoe company..I support Livestrong and that made it easier, and thought that Lance Armstrong wouldn't have his name on something inferior. Well, it is a nice watch - easy to operate, stylish, and so far, durable. The titanium makes it lightweight compared to some of my stainless watches in the same size range. It has kept perfect time for the past 2 months. Seems pretty scratch resistant. I swim with it daily and no problems thus far. I would recommend it to a friend."
2,Beautiful but...,"I bought this watch back in 2007. Great design, people everywhere asking where i get it.. but... without any explanation the titanium bracelet break it!I was in vacations and luckily, when the bracelet breaks, i was not at the ocean, but in my hotel room.It's my last Nike watch.. since then i got 4 other watchs (tissot, seiko, casio) and got no problems."
5,Dr. Sears,Dr. Sears is my favorite author of children's books. Dr. and Martha Sears offer valuable advice and helpful hints for managing the demands and joys of child rearing.
2,Geared only toward breastfeeding stay-at-home moms!,"This Christian-published book is insulting to women who cannot stay at home and who cannot breastfeed. The basic premise of bonding (""attachment parenting"") is a good one but the authors take the idea far beyond what is normal or reasonable. They suggest allowing your child to sleep with you until age two or three and that you should always be available to breastfeed because it is a mother's duty! These ideas are ludicrous in today's society in which most mothers are no longer homebound 24/7. This book is a poor excuse for a childcare source, even for practicing Christian mothers such as myself."
3,"Another good K-Drama, BUT.....","Another good SBS K-Drama. This one is alot more action-oriented and grittier than your typical K-drama, but romance and comedy are still there. Lee Min Ho and especially Lee Joon-Hyuk (as the prosecutor) do a fantastic job as the 2 male leads. The only thing that I found annoying (and comical) about these 2 guys was Lee Min Ho's sometimes outrageous wardrobe selections.....someone who's supposed to be ""stealthy"" shouldn't dress like a bad 1980's ""Miami Vice"" character. The main female lead, Park Min-Young, does a decent job but she doesn't have a whole lot of interaction with Lee Min-Ho other than a few romantic scenes which is disappointing. Also, the ending was not very good.....too abrupt and too many loose ends still hanging.....almost like the writers couldn't figure out how to end it properly."
