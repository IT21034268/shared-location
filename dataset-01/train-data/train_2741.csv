4,Hoppin' On The Ghoul-Bus...,"A 50yo urban legend, a masked killer, and a dark secret held by an entire town combine to form the story for FINGERPRINTS. A recovering teen girl (Leah Pipes) returns to her family after rehab, only to be plunged into the middle of the ghostly mystery. Is the legend for real? Are the restless spirits of long-dead children roaming the steets of Emerald? Could be! Lou Diamond Phillips is the ill-fated school guidance counselor. Geoffrey Lewis is the town drunk (w/ a major piece of the puzzle). Also starring Ã¼ber-hottie Kristin Cavallari as Crystal! My goodness..."
1,Awful!,"I only watched this because I paid for it. It was terrible. An attempted rape goes unreported, and it is of no apparent concern to the victim. People were being murdered in the city, and no one seems to notice until near the very end. The characters are all one-dimensional.For example, the mom is horrible; the dad is a slave to the mom; the daughters are all ""cool."" Nothing redeeming at all."
2,OK as a LAST resort cheap rental ONLY!,"It is very much an 80's style horror/slasher/ghost tale ---not a lot of gore, but some unsettling scenes. Predictable plot that is somewhat disjointed. The best thing about this movie is Kristin Cavallari, with Leah Pipes a close second. Guy teens and their older college brothers will love it. The acting is very ho-hum, and honestly, I fell asleep at one point. It is an interesting take on an old urban legend, but in my opinion they went the wrong way with it and turned it into something far less interesting. I watched it because it was FREE on PRIME and I have all but depleted the other options. Those not exposed to modern horror will jump, and be afraid ---the more jaded horror fans will....well.... fall asleep."
4,Great one for Halloween night,I had just watched this movie last night and it was a good ghost movie some parts were a little creepy.Definately a good one for a turn out the lights and grab some popcorn on halloween night not a good one for the children has a couple of nude scenes in it.
3,Slow to Start Good Little Indie - Creepy not scary,"This film is a good idea executed fair to midlin'. Don't get it if you want blood, guts, or jump-out-of-your-skin scares. It IS creepy in some parts, and the supernatural bits are good. These are its merits.On the flipside: There's lots of bad acting but not so bad it will have you laughing, more like wincing. The lead's mother is especially wooden and should stop her botox injections because its preventing her to emote at all. Stupid subplot of drug rehab slows things down quite a bit.....almost stalls the action on more than one occasion. A token rape attempt scene and suicide fall flat in an attempt to nicely wrap up all the loose ends so we hate the bad guys and shallowly wish for their unexpected demise. Production values are A+. Overall, its not bad, its just not good."
2,had potential....,"""Fingerprints"" title explains it. The initial story is good, bus crash...ghosts...so much could have been done but just didnt deliver. Had to much story about the crash itself and next to no action. Acting wasnt to bad the fxs were ok. Just overall a boring movie."
5,GREAT THRILLER MOVIE OF ALL TIMES,A Master Of Horror Movie. Terrifying On The Edge Of Your Seat. You Must Buy And Watch This Movie. With Every Little Detail. I Enjoy This Movie Alot.
3,better than i expected,"a small town horror story, a la nightmare on elm street. with a genuine mystery & some genuinely creepy moments.definitely worth a viewing."
1,Laughably bad.,"Could have been good in the hands of a more accomplished, more talented crew. The story is very very very familiar, but I'd be willing to overlook that if this film had been done with any understanding of suspense and horror. The makers should be forced to watch a legendary creepy movie such as the original Halloween 1,000 times as punishment for producing this piece of garbage."
3,Don't get same color as your bike rims,"I bought these valve caps on Amazon and they have been in use for me for a few weeks to pimp up one of my beach cruisers. Here's my feedback/comments:~I don't think they include the measurement specs in the product details (although I think they should for all products). The valve caps are about 1.0 inches tall, .75 inches wide, and sit about .5 inches above valve cap when screwed on.~These valve caps appear to be decent quality to me thus far.~Color contrast - if you actually want these valve caps to be visible/noticed then don't get the same valve cap color as your bike rims. In my case my bike rims are silver and these valve caps are silver so they aren't really noticeable. I wish I got gold color instead.Overall, I give 3 stars because they are decent (average) but not amazing. I hope you found my review helpful."
1,The guardian season 1 & 2,"This is an excellent TV show. Completely different from any other lawyer show that I've watched on T. V.However be warned..... there is something terribly wrong with season 1 & 2 more than half of the shows just skip and jump and you simply can't watch them. the volume comes and goes the picture the same... I have tried the Disc on other players and it's all the same. I had he series too long to send it back never dreaming that this kind of problem would arise. Never in all the DVD that Ihave purchased have I encounted a problem like this...I even bought season 2 again on Ebay to see if it would play ... it would not, the same problem. The show is that good."
4,I enjoyed this series - did not like how it ended. :-(,I enjoyed how it progressed from him being self centered and egotistical to becoming a really decent human being and really giving of himself to others. I hated how much he gave up to become who he was in the end only to find himself alone. I thought she should have married him and given him another chance to prove he had changed. I did not like the ending but I think in the end he was a happier man than he was when the series started - I know he was more humane at the end of the series. I liked him better at the end. :-)
5,The Guardian Complete Series,This series was reshown on TV recently. I was pleased to see it offered at a reasonable price and even more pleased when it arrived quickly and in new condition.
4,Different but Just Great,"I ordered this drum-shaped covered sugar bowl to replace one that my Wife broke the lid on. From the pictures on Amazon, I thought it was an identical match to the one that was broken but when we received it, we found that it is slightly (only slightly) smaller than our original. It is exactly what was advertised by Amazon but I jumped to the conclusion that they would be the same and they aren't - it is no big deal, my Wife is very happy with the new one but it was a surprise that they were so close to each other and both from the Portmerion Botanic Garden collection. We are happy!"
4,just what I expected,this Sugar bowl came in wrapped very safely and in perfect condition. I am very happy with the supplier. Lid is solid with no opening to leave a spoon in it so I cannot leave a spoon in it like I used to with my old sugar bowl. But I can get used to that.
1,Arrived broken,I ordered this and it arrived broken and was very poorly packed. A disappointment would be putting it lightly.
3,Zambonis Headline All-Star CD,"While I bought this CD for its three tracks by The Zambonis, there are plenty of other excellent holiday favorites. But, I must admit, my favorite song is ""Christmas Hockey News."" Maybe not a classic holiday album, but certainly one that will provide some much-needed diversity for your collection."
1,Never got my product,I never got the product from the seller but my credit card was charged. It's been over a month so I just went to the store and bought it.
3,Not sure.....,"I have to agree with many other reviews of this album, very radio friendly.....a lot of the songs almost ahve an '80s lyrics style to them, I had to look at the band members again to see if Poison had made a new appearance....it was crazy...""Lips of an Angel"" is still the best song, however there are a couple harder tracks that you can rattle your teeth to....I got'em memorized as tracks 5 and 8 as the 'crank it' tracks. I'll stick with Breaking Benjamin though, still a much more original sound...."
4,Excellent choice,I bought this CD for two of the songs that were out on single and found out that the entire CD was worth it.
1,Hinder is a disgrace to rock music,"This band is so freaking terrible. I can't decide who is worse Nickelback or these guys. Now if you love Nickelback, Creed, Three Doors Down, Matchbox Twenty, Puddle of Mudd, (insert monotonous modern rock band here), etc. you will LOVE this. However if you like interesting rock and roll that doesn't all sound like the same slop, well then you will definitely want to look elsewhere. All the songs on here suck, ""Lips Of An Angel"" and ""Better than Me"" are two of the worst songs I've ever heard. Now if you like formulatic souless boring rock, that's cool I actually USED to listen to stuff like this myself but then I discovered what real rock sounds like and well I will never go back to this."
5,I'M BLOWN AWAY,"I'm the person that really thought that the majority of todays music downwright sucked. And I still stand by that statement except for the real rocken bands like Shindown and now Hinder. Hinder is awesome and I'm so happy to know that great music does exsist somewhere out there. All I listen to is 80's metal and this is as close as your ever gonna get. But I am truly amazed that real rock is still being produced and this is all this cd is. Tracks that really stand out are 'Get Stoned', 'How Long', and 'Bliss (I dont wanna know)' Lips of an angel is also a really good ballad. But just to sum it up this whole cd is awesome and I highly recommend you going and getting this cd."
3,"Ok, nothing that stands out big, and now so overplayed with ""lips of an angel"".","I picked this CD at the end of september the week it was released, it was on sale for 5.99 and I thought it would be something new. Its not bad, but it is no classic either. No real stand out rock songs that seperates them from the rock pack. The first song I heard on the radio was ""get stoned"", which isn't bad, and it peaked my interest to buy the album. But, The rest of the album is just kinda middle of the road rock, nothing special in my book. Now that ""Lips of an Angel"" is so overplayed, I feel the urge to destroy the album, but am holding on to it because in time the fanfare will pass. One reviewer wrote that these guys remind him of nickelback...I don't see the correlation. yeah, they are in a similar genre, but different. It is good to see a band from somewhere other than the coast, Oklahoma based Hinder does a fair job with this album, and I would like to see what the future albums will look like."
4,Good Stuff,"If you like rock that has a meaning other than just trying to make money then you'll enjoy Hinder's freshman album entitled ""Extreme Behavior"". It is good to see bands playing their own songs and not stuff written by an outside song writer. Two good songs off the album are ""Get Stoned"" and ""Lips of an Angel"". ""Get Stoned"" is on of their more aggressive tunes that shows they can rock, while ""Lips of an Angel"" is more mellow and shows that their music can be listened to without getting the urge to stand up and punch someone in the face. I recommend this cd to anyone who wants to relax or has some time where they need to wind down. It drew me in due to the fact that it wasn't constant screaming and loud aggression over the microphone. This is one of the bands you can actually understand compared to the screaming lyrics of other bands. Indeed if you like the sounds of Crossfade and Nickelback then you will enjoy Hinder's ""Extreme Behavior""."
3,CLEAN WAL-MART VERSION,This is a Walmart Exclusive. Which means a CLEAN VERSION. Too Bad. The live tracks are edited. Making the disc sound like it's skipping. The bonus are the Bon Jovi & Eddie Money covers. The band does an EXCELLENT job on those two tracks. This is more for the hardcore fans. I thought it was worth it.
1,First reviewer was right,"If you're 14, you'll love these guys. This band is little more than a Nickleback clone. 'Get Stoned' and 'Better than Me' are the only two songs on this mess worth listening to...and those just barely. Generic radio rock/nu-metal is all this is. Save your money."
1,Duuuuuuuude!,"There is nothing new here. If you're a fan of lyrics and song structures that are about as complex as shampooing your hair then you'll dig this. Seems bands that make references to drug-use and being chauvinistic do very well these days (especially among women...are they that self-loathing or do they just not listen to the lyrics?)I honestly don't believe it is only a 1-star album, but it seems the majority of people posting reviews here are just defending this band against people comparing them to Nickelback. So I'm giving it a one in the hopes to bring the average rating down to where I believe it should be, which is 2 1/2. A completely average album."
1,This Blows,"If All Music have the guts to give this album 1 and a half stars, then I most certainly have enough to give it one star.Pick up the new Pearl Jam album for some good rock and roll, avoid this at all costs."
5,Awesome new band,These guys are awesome. Their sound is new but still has a good touch of the 80's rock era.
4,Give it a rest,"Granted, this is not the greatest album ever, though it is very good. I particularly enjoy ""Better than Me"", ""Homecoming Queen"" and ""Lips of an Angel""I see some irony in that the people that keep saying it's unoriginal, lousy, just like Nickelback, etc, etc. are most likely just following the crowd.They fault Hinder, make fun of Nickelback (who I'm not a fan of), and say they're like other bands. Then they're turning around and saying what one another is saying. I guess it's cool to follow the crowd after all?I listen to a VAST array of music. If is sounds good, I listen to it, I don't fall for the whole ""It's cool to make fun of other bands"" crowd."
1,RIPPED OFF!!!,"These people took my money and sent me no CD. I have sent numerous emails to them and they are ignored. Bad business, don't take a chance that you will be ripped off too. Go to someone else to buy your CD."
4,the album is insane...,"i loved the album, but i haven't listen to it once since i saw them live. i'm not sure what did it to me, but i lost interest."
4,Gift,"This was a gift, so I have no idea if it was any good. It did arrive in plenty of time in the condition that was stated."
5,Great New Band,I heard this band open at a Nickelback concert & liked them so much I bought the CD. I love the entire CD! I keep listening to it over & over!
3,A good listen...,"Unoriginal does not mean ""unlistenable"". I have heard many original bands that sound absolutely horrid. Yes, nothing new or profound about Hinder, but it is a good listen. So if you do not own much in the way of, for example, Nickelback, no reason to not go for this instead."
4,Sounds like NickelBack,"When I first heard them, I thought they were Nickelback. Good sounding CD. Their first hit ""Get Stoned"" didn't receive a lot of airplay, at least not around here. Saw the video which made me get the cd. They will be an up and coming group. If you are a NickelBack fan, you'll enjoy this CD."
2,Extreme Radio Friendly Tunes!,"The only thing that's ""Extreme"" is how ""Radio Friendly"" this CD is. I'm a fan of Nickelback, so when I heard a couple Hinder tunes I decided to get this CD. I wish I listened to the other reviews. Many bands ride the wave of success that others have made. They many sound similar or have a similar style. I don't have a problem with that. Many great bands have come out since Nickelback's initial success. Default, Theory of a Deadman, the list goes on. Even thou they had a similar style they found a way to standout. Whether it was great guitars, vocals or song writing. To me Hinder fails to standout. If you like Nickelback, Default, Theory, Alterbridge, Tantric, Shinedown, etc..... Hinder won't crack your CD rotation. It has a couple good tunes here or their but for me the music has no edge. Just a bunch of radio friendly tunes. It's ""Nickelback Light"". If that sounds good to you, you can have mine."
3,Buy Zeromancer or Finger Eleven instead...,"These guys put out a great first effort. Everything is great about this ablum except the lyrics.....totally junior high. (Ive said highschool before, but have since downgraded to junior high).....anyway. Invest in Zeromancer's Doctor online, or a Finger Eleven for some music that is above average & lyrics that dont get old after 2 weeks. But.... keep Hinder in mind, there is nothing boring about this guy's live performance..... he's got rockstar written all over him (Ive seen him live and was impressed even at 37) , unfortunatly sometimes I need more than a hottie in leather pants to amuse me. darn it! I would have added another star to this album if it wasnt for all those ""I sound like a 6th grade boy singing about how I finally got some...lyrics!"" Cause we all know real men dont sing and tell......."
4,"Not necessarily what you would expect, but still likeable","With the way most people talk about this CD, the buyer probably expects to get something just like Nickelback. Hinder is actually pretty different. They basically try to bring back 80s rock (like Def Leppard-type stuff). Most of the CD is ballads; the one everybody knows is ""Lips of an Angel"" and it's actually not one of the better songs on the CD. One of my favorites is ""By the Way"" which has a slick guitar over a nice chorus. Not all of the tracks are power ballads, though: ""Shoulda"" sounds a lot like something by Breaking Benjamin or Chevelle. If you buy this CD, know that it's good, but it doesn't rock that hard (you just cant headbang to it). It's a good CD for listening to in the background while doing something else."
1,Below Craptastic,"Third-rate glam rock with the most illiterate, trailertrashian lyrics since the onslaught of the 1970s Top 40 schlockmeisters. Makes Bon Jovi and REO Speedwagon sound like musical geniuses, and that ain't easy. A true stinking pile."
3,its alright,"Everyone is saying they are a nickelback ripoff. I dont think that, but i love nickelback and i just like hinder. My favorite song on the cd is get stoned. Awesome track. I can listen to about 6 of the songs on this cd before switching cds, whereas Nickelback i can put any one of their cds in and listen for hours.Now nickelback was a little rocky in the start of thier music career. just listen to curb, and then listen to for all the right reasons. Each band has to find out what their style is and what their good at. Hinder will be a music force sooner or later i have no doubt but this cd is ok. I found that it does grow on you though."
5,HINDER - kicks a _ _ boogiewolf69,"If you like Nickelback or Three Doors Down you got a new band to listen to. An its called Hinder. just recently I converted a hard core country gal to rock an roll, her favorite rock bands Kid Rock, Nickelback, AC/DC, and Three Doors Down. Now she loves Hinder. An like me the more she listens to them the more she likes them. As some songs get more depth as you listen to them. So if you like Nickelback or Three Doors Down buy this CD if you don't like them well I warned you.this is my first review thats how much I like this band, and playing in a band I'm gonna learn some of these songs."
1,"After listening to this, you will forget it immediately","The beauty of a band as bad as this, is that they will be out of everyones collective consciousness in a very short time, as they move from arenas, back to the local dive they were playing before. Enjoy the ride down guys!"
2,i don't really even care about Hinder...,"i'm just pointing out how little Amazon's music critic who wrote this review knows about music. to compare these guys to GN'R, L.A. Guns and Faster Pussycat is laughable and just plain lazy. refined tastes? get over yourself..."
4,quit hating,I don't think this band can be compared to nickelback because i actually think they are better than them. At least these guys throw in guitar solos in some songs and show some amount of talent.
5,Hinder,This band is obviously new. when i heard it on the radio for the first time i immediatly liked it. note i hate numetal with a passion because it all sounds the same to me. any way i heard get stoned and had to buy it and am glad i did to all you saying that they are nickelback the lead singers voice is way better than chads. get stoned is a very catchy tune which makes i worth buying the album.If i lost the album i would buy it again when i could.Just lettin you know.
4,Documentary spoils a good DVD concert.,"I mainly bought this CD/DVD for the DVD, since I already had the CD in digital format.Hinder's music has grown on me. I wanted to get a concert DVD of them, because I have been enjoying Three Days Grace's DVD.I'm pleased with the quality of the concert footage, but unfortunately you have to put up with the band's documetary in order to watch through it. Unlike Three Days Grace's band members, I find Hinder's to be self-indulgent and immature. It really spoils a good performance. I wish they would separate the band's documentary to a separate title on the DVD.In general, I am satisfied with the value of the purchase. However the DVD could have been done better, so I deduct one star."
3,An ok band,I agree that they follow the same formula as Nickelback and Theory of a Deadman. When I heard get stond i thought that it was one of the bands mentioned above. However they do have a good sound and it is entertaining. Lips of an angel is an awsome song and some of the others brng back som memoris. It all depends on the listener. In the end I give them an ok rating and worth having your friend make you a tape.
3,Better than I was expecting,"Saw these guys at the Theory of a Deadman show last week. Was a bit surprised they were the headliner, seeing how they only really have 1 hit song.I will say this band is alot different if you see them live.I stuck around to watch their set and immidiately thought I was watching BuckCherry. I think the lead singer of Hinder has some Josh Todd influences. The rest of the band also put on a pretty good display.I then downloaded a couple songs I liked from the show. To my disappointment, they sounded totally different. It was like I bought a CD from a different band. They looked and sounded like BuckCherry live, but they sound like a totally different band on the CD.I will say there are a couple good songs on the CDI like Get Stoned of course, and really like the sound of Homecoming Queen. Lips of an Angel also has some staying power"
1,Wanna be a rock band? learn fron this,"Ok , remember the 1980's rock area and how most bands looked and sounded alike.Well now its happening again.Everyone wants to sound like Nickleback.Thats a bad thing.Hinder comes off as a well studied group.They studied the right lyrics and guitar sounds to sound cool.Wow so they admit to getting stoned and drunk.How cool.If you ever seen their video for ""lips of an angel"" you'd understand were i'm coming from.The singer tries to look and act like Steven Tyler and actually looks like he ate some bad food instead.This cd is a pure rip off and this is another 'were are they now' group.Save your money people."
1,If you like Nickleback you will love this.,"I however can't stand Nickleback and only ended up with this CD because my wife wanted it. Neither of us like it. The songs are nothing more than watered down ""nu metal"" whatever the heck that is.If you want to listen to some good rock and roll stick to Black Sabbath, Led Zep, Cream, etc....If you don't mind assaulting your ears with musical garbage then by all means buy this album."
5,Great Band--Great CD!!!,"This is the best band I've heard in a long time! The entire cd is excellent!! They will be huge soon!! If you don't have this CD, Get it!!"
4,"Not bad, good sound","I suppose if all you ever listen to is Nickelback, you might start to think that every band who uses a guitar must sound like Nickelback. Don't be fooled by the condescending comparisons; anyone with an ear can hear the difference in the bands.Hinder has a good sound; Austin Winkler has a very distinctive voice, and the band knows how to rock. They tend to sing about being drunk and/or high a lot, and a lot of their stuff is about dysfunctional relationships, but it's easy to listen to.All in all, this is one of the better bands to come out this year. Give it a try."
4,Brash,"I bought this album because I broke the first one (it was literally smashed during a move and in 3 pieces). I didn't hesitate to replace this album because it's so great. I hope I don't break this one but if I do, I'll replace it again."
2,middle of the road,"This album has one really great song, and a bunch or others ones that attempt to achieve the same momentum. I really dont like the album. I bought this under the premises that the rest of the album was going to sound as good as ""get stoned"", but like I said the rest of the album does not even sound like the same band....strange. Take the same $10 and buy ""Digital Ash In The Digital Urn"" by Bright Eyes. A much better sound for the $$$."
1,decently mundane music - horrible musicians!,"Ever catch a tune in your head that won't let go? Doesn't make it great music, just a bit interesting.Ever watch a concert where every last member is off? Off key, off tempo, just horribly off?This band is far too new and unestablised to have a worn out lead singer so bad that half the venue LEAVES three songs into the act.I have half-way enjoyed the music on the radio, but after seeing them live. This is a one album-wonder. You are not rock gods. you are rock disappointments."
4,Get Over It,"That's what I say to the first 2 reviewers with all the Nickleback comparisons. ""Lips of an Angel"" is so far from anything Nickleback-ish that's it's not even in the same decade. This is a power ballad through and through reaching back to the great years of the format and ranking up with best of them right next to Tesla and the lot. I had almost thought that true power ballads in rock were dead till hearing this song. It's nice to see I was wrong.Technically the work is done exceptionally well for a debut and following a ""radio ready"" format is hardly anything to ashamed of to break in to the industry. I'm interested to see what this band can do in the future to find a true indentity of their own aside from simply being a VERY good power rock band up front (like that's all bad?)."
1,Don't Buy This Album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This music sucks. You will be dumber for having listened to this or linkin park or staind or breaking benjamin, etcIf you need some new music, try one of these:RevolverAbbey RoadAutomatic For The PeopleLayla And Other Assorted Love SongsWho's NextBorn To RunWhat's Going OnZenyatta MondattaLondon CallingExile On Main Street"
1,"I think that the song lips of an angel should be renamed ""I'm just not that into you or my girlfriend either""",Extreme behaviour? I think not. Perhaps extremely bad lyrics. Was this dude stoned when he wrote the lyrics or really that shallow? I just love that romantic song that they play on the radio all the time about the dude that's cheating on his girl friend w/ another woman and they dare to call it lips of an angel? Could it get any sicker? I think the song should be retitled Welcome to Hell.
1,Rock has hit an all-time low folks,When a band like Hinder goes platinum what else can you say? This is complete rubbish. When I first heard Lips of an Angel I threw up in my mouth a little.
1,a joke?,"Are these songs really different? They all sound the same, screaming, heavy breathing and loud drums. This is not music, this is just noise with a beat!"
1,"Yeah, one Nickelback was more than enough...","They do sound exactly like Nickelback. I won't harp on it because that's all been done, but just face it - they're an imitation...to Nickelback what Hoobastank is to Incubus, except that Incubus is good...But just forgetting all of that for a moment...they're not any good. The singer's voice sounds over-enunciated and forced and the songs are, well, in a word, lame. Topping the lame charts is ""Lips of an Angel."" If you're looking for a whiny, self-important tune about a guy who just can't *sniffle* pick between two girls and has to have secret goo-goo-whispery conversations with the ex while the current g/f sits ""blissfully"" unaware in the next room, then this is your band. ""Oh, everyone, feel my pain because I couldn't POSSIBLY break up with the girl I supposedly don't like and go back to the one I supposedly do, 'cause then I wouldn't be a playa, yo."" Gag me. Go away."
1,Nope...x2...and second the motion for Fozzy!,"Hinder sounds so forced and contrived.......I just don't get these guys, at all....reference the other review on Fozzy...that's a great CD that deserves a million times more attention. All that Remains Reloaded...CD of the year...you heard it here first!All That Remains Reloaded (W/Dvd)"
4,good cd,"This is a good CD, there are some songs that I don't particularly care for, but all in all it is a good addition to a CD collection."
5,Worth the money,"A very interesting book that gives insight as to what happened after the battle. Very informative, makes you think about the Civil War in a different light."
1,The challenge is enduring this book....,"The challenge in reading this book is to actually reach theend without throwing one's hands up in dismay. The poorwriting, the factual errors, and the repetition all combine tomake reading this book not merely a challenge, but anordeal. Check the bibliography for some worthwhile bookson the topic."
5,Smart Shopper,The Plantronics PC Mic is a great mic at any price. I use with TV Ears in front of the center channel speaker. It pick ups the dialog of the movie with out picking up other sounds>
1,Please don't buy this,"just bought it, plugged it in, my computer recognized that I plugged a mic in. I went straight to audacity to see what kind of quality I would get from it. I spoke into it. Not a blip. I moved it all the way to my mouth and spoke stern and loud. I got the smallest of peaks. I went to play it back, nothing. I cranked my speakers up, had them played a loud irritating tone. While it was playing I moved my mic really back and forth from about a foot away to right next to my speaker. played it back. nothing. It wasn't until I cranked up the playback by 40 (yes, 40) decibels that I heard the faintest of tones coming from my microphone. Please. dont buy this microphone. The microphone your webcam came with is better than this."
2,A Review,"This microphone, along with a voice-capable analog Multitech modem (Multimodem ZPX) and Venta Fax & Voice call management software, is used for making toll free phone calls occasionally from a PC. The microphone will not pick up a voice adequately unless the speaker is within two or three inches of it. One must either lean into the microphone closely, or hold it up to the mouth while talking, neither of which is convenient."
3,"A fun read, but not for the novice knitter","A knitter of only afghans, I read this book after being inspired to try a pair of socks by some of the humorous blogs. The chatty and easy writing mistakenly convinced me to try her basic sock pattern as my first. Turning the heel, and an important omission in the directions earlier were the death of my attempt with these directions. This book is not for the sock virgin."
5,Fun sock book,"This book is about knitting socks! The first part deals with dying the yarn and then moving on to the knitting. Even if you are not interested in the dying of yarn, the knitting information they give you is very helpful. Maybe you might even try some dying,,,,the Kool Aid dying is easy!"
3,"Is the word ""glottochronology?""","The book was 45 years old and pages yellowed with age. My main concern, though, was that languages evolve and in doing so change. However I am learning a lot from this tiny tome."
4,Mr. Hamburger has done it again.,"If you like what Greg Turkington does, they you'll love this CD. I do, so I do! :)"
5,Why so much?,"I would love to have this book, but it's a bit too expensive.These books were always handed out for freeand there should be somewhere around 100,000 of them.I'm surprised anyone of Jehovah's Witnesses would have denied Russels's book.Sometimes we're new Bible student's and are immature in our knowledge.I personally have not read it and I know there were initially a lot of hard feelingswhen the book was released. Russel strived to find the truth and succeeded in so many ways.The Bible is so much deeper than most people can understand. It takes many years if not a life timeor even never to know all of the information and I, like millions of other people believe withevery fiber of our being that Jehovah God (Psalms 83:18) sheds light when the time is necessary.There have been many changes in this brotherhood for strict truth.I'm curious to read this book to see what the previous comment is referring to."
3,Unsung Cat Review,"This book is a decent read for Warne Marsh fans and has some interesting insights into Lennie Tristano and his school; awfully dry at times though.While I really like Warne Marsh's playing, the book seems to idolize him and hold him in a much, much higher realm than I think he belongs.Again, a good read with some very interesting information."
5,Going strong after 11yrs,"Even after 11yrs, this game is still fun to play. From the old teams (hartford and quebec) to the one-timers, NHL 94 is a great game to play. There is something to be said about the older, simpler games with just 3 control buttons. Playing as the visiting team, and hearing that classic ""Booing"" from the home crowd when you score is just excellent stuff!! The newer games are incredible, but you almost have to take a class to learn how to play them. With this SEGA game, you can just start up and play. Maybe thats the way it should be..."
5,10 years later -- and it's still the best,"I got this game when it came out in late '93. I was addicted immediately. Ten years later I'm still playing it with my little brother and all. I can't explain why it is still one of the best games I own -- most of the players have either been traded or have retired, some of the teams don't even exist anymore (Quebec Nordiques anyone?) but for some reason the tempo, the camera view, the speedy goal tricks, the smashing of pixelated characters into penalty boxes and benches -- all of it comes together in this game to make a perfect blend of gameplay, ease, and replay value that still haven't gotten old.Quick tips for any players -- Roenick is damn near unstoppable on the break, Selanne is the fastest in the game, and the breakaway triple-deke is nearly unblockable. This game can't be put down!"
3,Not the classic of '95.,"NHL '95 is still the best hockey game ever released. This is behind it in so many ways, including graphics, and momentum. It takes a while for the action and tension to build, so beware of really boring games. There is also slowdown and clipping, so you should probably buy something else instead."
3,meh.,"This is one case where I was attracted to a title because of its creators--primarily the writer, Brian Michael Bendis--but became less enthused after experiencing the actual work. Alias is decent, but this volume in particular seemed rather self-indulgent and more about Big Important Issues than actual story. I don't deny that the Issues addressed are Big and Important, but the presentation here just didn't work for me. YMMV."
3,"Rosie is unique, entertaining, and presents ""earthy"" product",I enjoy Zydeco style...Rosie is a genuine original...no pretentiousness...great tongue-in-cheek humor...a diva from the bayous...
5,ZESTY ZYDECKO,If you like Rosie Ledet you'll want this one in your collection. In my opinion she is the top female vocalist and a real talent with the accordian.
3,Should Never Have Been,"Had difficulty with the dialect, but once acclimated to it found the details of her life fascinating. Hope she is happy today."
4,Una historia fabulosa,"En la vanguardia del Rock progresivo italiano, este es un album obligatorio para los amantes de este genero.Destacan sin duda alguna ""Una storia fiabesca"" e ""Rittuale notturno"". El manejo de los teclados y la sensacion de orquestacion aunado a las vocales (desconozco a los integrantes de este grupo) de tipico sabor italiano lo convierten en una rica experiencia auditiva que no debe pasarse por alto."
4,My thoughts exactly,"I, too, read this book in college and have read it a number of times again with great pleasure. A friend once described it as "" a roleplaying game adventure"", but it is much more. The characters are haunting, the mood powerfully bittersweet. No success comes without a price and, while each character's dreams are realized, that realization is not what they expected. The background is quite vague and makes the book harder to follow than it might be - but it means the imagination can really get to work and that each re-reading brings new pleasures."
3,Digimon Rumble Arena,"this is a very fun game, but it does have a few problems. the voice acting is of low quality and the rest of the game cannot make up that fact. oh and the instructions could be a bit more helpful. though, those are like the only things wrong with this game so it is still worth buying, in my opinion. yet, not everyone can truly enjoy this game so i recommend it to digimon fans. lastly, when you go to options there is an option called ""input password"" where you can type passwords to get characters and i happen to know a few passwords: KIMJOY, LINMON, ROYBOY, MINNYN, SERIUS, KENSAN & QRIOUS."
4,Let's Get Ready to Rumble!,"This game has the qualities that Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros presents. This video game is based on the serries that has even surpassed Pokemon at some times. Has charcaters from all three seasons such as Tai + Agumon and Matt + Gabumon from 01, Davis + Veemon, TK + Patamon, Kari + Gatomon, and Ken + Wormmon from season 02, and the traditional 3 from Digimon Tamers, Takatomon + Guilmon, Henry + Terriermon, and Rika + Renamon. There all also hidden cahracters to find.I particulary like to Play as Sakuyamon and Beelzamon, but digimon like Metal-Garurumon and War-Greymon, have a pretty nice charm.Pretty easy game to conquer (perhaps to easy for some) but this game will grab the secret desires of digimon fans everywhere."
5,Very Cool!!,"Digimon finally comes to life in ""Digimon Rumble Arena"" in this game you can choose your favorite digimon and battle it out with a friend or the computer. The graphics are the best that can be for the playstation, and the inclusion of the original voices from the tv show were a nice touch! The only thing missing is being able to Digivolve to your champion or ultimate forms, but it is still an awesome game and the perfect addition to any Digi-collection!!"
3,super fun .....then boring,It was really fun at first but when you beat it a couple times it is dead boring. If you want a game that will last long and you are over 6 than look somwhere else. A 5 year old toddler would probably play until their parents told them to play outside. HAPPY HUNTING!
5,THIS GAME IS SO COOL!!!!!!!!,"MY COUSIN HAS THIS GAME. ONCE I PLAYED THIS GAME ICOULDNT STOP. ALSO ITS REALLY EASY TO LEARN.U GET 2 PLAY WITH AGUMON, GABUMON, VEEMON, WORMMON,GUILMON,RENAMON,ANDTERRIERMON.U CAN ALSO DIGIVOLVE. BUT ONLY TO MEGA.ITS STILL COOL. U CAN ALSO GET OTHER DIGIMON LIKE BLACKWARGREYMON, AND REAPERMON.MY FAVORITE DIGIMON TO USE ARE RENAMON, AND BLACKWARGREYMON."
4,My Review,"GAMELAY 4/5This game is quite fun and it's hard to put it down. But there's two mistakes take make me give 1 less star. Here is it: When Digimon digivolves, there will be a pause. Then its partner will shout something. Then a voice ""DIGIVOLUTION!"" and finally digivolving. Why should they take such long time? And second, when attacking, you have to shout the attack's name in order to attack. When you and your opponent have only one life left and one more attack should K.O. either one, the attack with the shortest name come out first and the another one that's shouting the name get K.O. first, right?MUSIC 3/5In my opinion, it is quite annoying and brake your concentration.GRAPHICS 4/5Good enough, except for the last stage, where you battle Reapermon, the background get so colorful that weak people may get a headache or vomit, etc.CONTROLS 5/5Easy to control, escpecially when you can use L3 and R3."
4,An interesting combo,"Digimon Rumble Arena is a game in which you can be a Digimon from seasons 1-3, and you get to harness their special abilities, such as digivolving and special attacks. The pros about this game are that the controls are user friendly and easy to pick up, the voices are pretty close to the TV show, except for a few people, and there are secret characters. Unfortunetly, there's only one secret level, very few secret characters(Although as you beat the game with certain digimon, you get their digivolved form in 2-player mode) and the secrets are VERY easy to get. All in all, this is a good game to keep from being bored for a while, but unless you play 2-player all the time, it gets old pretty quick."
5,SD Hiryu-No-Ken Meets DIGIMON!!!,"Yes, if you know ""Flying Dragon"" and have the ""SD Hiryu-No-Ken"" Game Boy cartridge, then you should know DIGIMON Rumble Arena is just that, Big heads, small bodies, SD Anime! If you know SD GUNDAM, IT'S THAT, WITH Street Fighter II fighting, and a slew of DIGIMON! I actually think they called it SD DIGIMON Fighting in Japan!! Guilmon is the actual SD form he should be! And he's one tough fighter! If you like Anime, DIGIMON, and SD FORM anime, With video game fighting, then DIGIMON Rumble Arena is a great game on PSX/PS1...."
1,THIS GAME IS THE WORST!,"this game (even for me, a Digimon fan) is a VERY bad game. there is only ONE secret stage, in which there is NO TERRAIN! ITS JUST A BLACK SCREEN W/PATTERNED BACKGROUND THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE A SCREENSAVER! also, most secret characters are just Digivolved forms of the rookies! graphics are horrible, music doesnt even grasp your attention, and mini games are no good. there virtually all the same thing and the AI in the mini games is like a headless chicken! also, the game is VERY SHORT. i beat it in less than 2 hours the day i got it, and an hour and 30 min. when i restarted the game.but perhaps the worst thing of all is tht each character has only 2 SPECIAL MOVES! AN O BUTTON AND A TRIANGLE BUTTON! THERE ARENT EVEN VARIATIONS OF THE MOVES EXCEPT FOR MELEE ATTACKS!so if u REALLY want to get a Digimon game, i would suggest Digimon World 1 or Digimon World 3 but NOT this game."
2,Just plain pathetic,"Personally, I found the game to be utter garbage. I have seen better graphics in many PSX games, such as Final Fantasy 7 8 and 9, Mega Man Legends 2, Tekken 3, Marval Vs Capcom, and Fatal Fury Wild Ambition. The game is similar to Lugi's Mansion, where it has a little entertainment value, but ABSOLUTELY NO replay value. The television voices aren't a plus, as the show is awful. The American dub is way off, and the voices make me cringe. Trust me, and stay clear away from this excuse for a bad playstation game."
5,Another inspiring book from Haupt!,"I greatly enjoyed Haupt's first book ""Rare Encounters with Ordinary Birds"" and ordered this one not knowing much about it. It was wonderful too! Haupt's warm, lyrical prose is well matched to her topic, which is to mine Darwin's little-known pocket notebooks for new insights. She paints a compelling story of him circumnavigating South America as a humble and patient observer, though as she puts it, ""This book is not in any way meant to pose as a biography; it is a gleaning of those instances in Darwin's life and work that inspire a renewed vision of the relationship between the human and natural worlds."" So... what meaning does Darwin's vision hold for us today? Haupt reminds us that there are lessons in Darwin's story, and especially in his approach, to inspire all of us - even those of us who had never read anything about him before!"
5,Sucrets Original Mint Lozenges are the Best!,Stores carry cherry flavor only. Cant find the original mint in any drug store. So glad to find them online.
5,Strange But True: Mysterious People Rocked Me,"I have over a hundred books on Forteana, the Occult, and Bermuda-Triangle type of mysteries, but I have never read anything like Thomas Slemen's book, Strange But True: Mysterious People. I don't know how he does it but Slemen draws you into the sinister and bizarre tales of his book, and it leaves you with an appetite for more of his tales. I have all of his English books as I live in London, and a friend in New York is so into Slemen, she has asked me to mail the books I have to her. Slemen's website is worth checking out: tomslemen.mainpage.netI would wholeheartedly recommend the book to all lovers of mysteries and the unknown."
4,The tests are a good copy of the real thing.,"The tests were a good challenge; however, the verbal section is not designed quite like that of the actual mcat but both test the same skills. There are few mistakes in the physical and biological sections, and some explanations for the verbal sections are confusing. Overall, these tests are a good imitation of the actual mcat."
4,Great contribution to a genre that can always use one,"This is a beautiful collection of original material for the euphonium that will interest both fans of contemporary music looking for something unusual, and fans of low brass instruments. If you're partial to Scandinavian composers you'll find that this is a worthy Finnish contribution to their already sizeable recorded literature.The disc features the very first commercial recording of a concerto for euphonium and symphony orchestra - worth purchasing for the historical value alone."
1,Music for A Doctor's Waiting Room,"Imagine orchestrating a score to reflect the nervousness and agitation felt in a doctor's waiting room.The Finnish Euphonium fits just such a bill.The tuneless fiddling and toodling,and the hiccuping oboe would make anyone restless.Rx: Take this CD with two aspirin, then toss it... in the morning."
1,"Oh, no!","First of all- what were they thinking when they replaced Kanoe's picture with Kotori's? I know, Kanoe's image was sort of wrong, but X is not meant for little kids anyway! Also, I think it was stupid to change the name. X3 is called ""the Seven Stars"", not ""Sonata""..."
4,Good proctective,"This is a good low priced protectant product.Gentle, and easy to apply.Would highly recommend this product.I have very sensitive skin, and this works well for me."
2,So Disappointed,"I was shocked when received Henry's Awful Mistake. It's awonderful fun book, but, I had no idea I was getting themini edition which is too small to really enjoy. Next timeI'd better read the fine print, you too..."
3,Henry's awful mistake,Book was smaller than I had anticipated. I was looking for hardcover 8*10 size. Expensive for such a small paperback.
3,10 Year Old Daughter Finished in One Day,"I got this game for my 10 year old daughter who loved the movie. She played it through all levels in just one day. Said she loved it, but I feel its too easy if she can complete all levels in the first day."
2,Ice Age,This game is okay for young children. It is very simple to pass since there are only 10 levels and they are very short. Don't waste your money unless the game is intended for someone under the age of 6.
5,Amazing,I had the frye harness 8r wore em for about 3 years now I got the black oil leather ones all I can say that they are amazing got them in the mail today fit true I suggest to everyone.
3,VERY PLEASED,"I was very pleased with the boots. At first they are really tight and hard to get on, but after you wear them a couple of times they loosen up. Also you will probably want to purchase some after market insoles for extra padding."
1,Don't waste your money,"This CD was a total waste of time and money. I learned nothing. It also was not very profesionally done. It sounded like it was recorded in a back room somewhere. You could here the author flipping pages, pausing and and stumbling when she lost her place. DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
5,good supplement,"This was a helpful review of the subject. If you skip around for sections you need, you will find this useful."
2,Worst S&S I've listened to,"I wish someone else had reviewed this before me. I'm sure I wouldn't have wasted so much money on it. The speaker reads in almost a monotone, and the content didn't relate to anything we covered in my Professional Responsibility class. I can't recommend these CDs at all, but still gave two stars because it's possible that they could relate to someone else's class content."
4,Oh my god he's on FIRE!,BOOM SHOCKLOKA! This game is a tru!e blast from the past. Was a lot of fun 2 play on the Genesis and on the Arcade. Def classic game where you could slam dunk while bursting into flames! LOL this game was kinda wacky like a lot of old school games
5,Very elegant CD,"Francis Rimbert's Double Face contains an eclectic selection of pieces, ranging from melodic up tempo of Woodoo to the classical inspired Adagio or the romantic Dorian Gray. IMHO, this CD by the French skilled keyboardist and Jean-Michel Jarre's collaborator, is one of the most elegant and beautiful synthesizer works ever."
3,CLASH OF EMPIRES,"I LIKE THIS KIND OF MOVIE BUT I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO WATCH IT YET AND THIS IS WHY I HAVE ONLY GIVEN IT 3 STARS,HOWEVER IT MAY BE AN EXCENLLENT MOVIE."
1,worst film ever!,"I just have a few things to say. Don't be like me, i was fooled by its evil marketing ploy. I have wasted time watching this garbage.This is a Z-Grade movie. Don't waste your time. Go watch other flicks. Believe me, it's not worth the money."
3,Unable to deal with the radio static and rumble.,"This wartime recording of Brahms 4th is generally considered his greatest, although the 1949 Wiesbaden recording (also with the Berlin Philharmonic, but on tour) is a finer recording on Tahra. The main problem with this FONO re-mastering is the inability to deal with the radio static and rumble in the 3rd and 4th movements. If that is not a problem for some ears, the recording is OK; but the best Furtwangler recording of the Brahms 4th is the one from Wiesbaden in 1949 on the Tahra label --which, incidentally, is the one the International Furtwangler Society recommends."
4,Very good video,"This is the second season of Melrose, the 90's icon show...it is full of surprises and fast and furious action, and introduces show favorites such as Sidney, Kimberly, and Amanda...all of the famous fights and drama are here, and for those of us who grew up watching it...it feels good to be home again...."
3,horrendous video quality ruins season 2,"Season 2, though enticing in its twists and turns, is painful to watch owing to its wretched picture quality. Even on a Sony Bravia 32"" by way of a blue-ray player(blue ray improves the picture of even regular DVD's by 2.5 times) there is visible fuzz on the screen. I cannot imaging watching this on a regualar TV and a standard DVD player. It's laughable how bad the characters look thanks to an abysmal video transfer. CBS needs to publish Melrose Place on blue-ray to make the show watchable, lest fans cringe like Michael when he learned Kimberly was ""dead.""I realize all older shows leave something to be desired in terms of picture quality, but this is a mess! Here's hoping the DVD sets of Season 3 or 4 are better."
4,Lots of Drama/Poor Quality,"Watching these many years after the show first came out is a lot of fun; the first season was somewhat of a snoozer, but with Kimberly and Sydney on hand, season 2 becomes much more entertaining and campy. If you want great acting and credible storylines, Melrose Place is not for you. If you're looking for cotton candy entertainment and great zingers, well, it doesn't get better than Amanda (Heather Locklear) and crew. Have to comment on the DVD's themselves; Paramount didn't go to too much trouble in giving a high quality picture; the source looks like a VHS tape, and it was somewhat disappointing to read on the liner notes that episodes had been edited and the music changed. Looks like Paramount went on the cheap for this one."
4,Melrose Place 2,It came quickly but the packaging was a little smashed. I liked that this item came quickly as I am addicted to the show. There has been a couple skips in the dvd's but overall good.
3,"I got what I paid for, but ...","I did get exactly what I paid for, and I remember being addicted to this show when I was in high school and it was on TV for the first time, but I didn't like it this time around. The storylines aren't that exciting and the characters aren't all that interesting. However, the DVDs did arrive exactly as ordered in good condition and within the time expected, so I'm not unhappy overall. If you're thinking of getting this, maybe wait til it's really cheap!"
5,"Beautiful people, ugly problems.","Melrose Place - The Complete Second Season is my favorite of this prime-time soap opera. Heather Locklear, Laura Leighton, Doug Savant, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Andrew Shue, Daphene Zuniga, and hunky Grant Show continue to deliver the goods. I think Marcia Cross returns this season and boy she is some nut! I loved this show and now I can watch these yummy episodes anytime I want. I highly recommend purchasing this sinfully addicting show, enjoy!"
5,Melrose Place - Season 2,"I wish the seasons would come out sooner. We have already watched the whole Season 2. Thanks, Bonnye"
3,Great DVD - Need Subtitles and Setup Options,"i recently got both seasons available (1 & 2) and they should have put a little more work on the menu. They almost didn't have any menus, no setup options. I bought it and didn't realize that most of the chapters didn't even have english subtitles. I would have like to have it subtitled in spanish, but at least in english on all chapters! great dvd though. should have been better."
4,Best on the Market!,"When I purchased mine, there was no Diaper Dekor+ which is the larger size. However, I feel that we have no need for a larger one. My child just turned two and it holds a weeks worth of diapers...no problem! I bought the Diaper Genie because I was told so many things about it and I hate it, it goes through bags quickly and the bags have a weird odor to them. I am currently pregnant and am sensitive to odors and the Diaper Dekor holds them all in until garbage day comes."
4,Keep diaper odors to a minimum,"These bags are quite easy to use, and with the Diaper Dekor, really keep odors to a minimum.One refill box contains 3 bags and usually lasts for several months."
2,It Works So Hard Keeping in Odors...It Breaks!,"Looks are deceiving. Instead of Diaper Genie, I bought the small Diaper Decor 18 months ago because of its appearance, and after a year, the pedal broke. Now we have to manually lift the lid, and it's smelly even though we clean it with bleach. The bags are very expensive! And hard to find. My small bags are no longer available in San Diego because the small pail is discontinued."
5,Excellent value,"We originally purchased the Diaper Dekor as a cheaper alternative to a Diaper Genie based off of a cousin's recommendation, and have been very happy with it. These refills are durable, trap the smell of used diapers very well, and are easy to replace.I had trouble replacing the liner the first time I attempted it, but only because I tried to do it myself without following the instructions. The instructions are simple, and make it an easy, quick process."
3,Size not listed clearly listed,"I ordered these refills and did not realize that there are 2 different sizes of refills. I only noticed this one when I was looking. They had no picture of the box shown so couldn't compare it to the ones I already had. I ended up with the wrong size after very slow shipping. Granted it was free, but it took 13 days for me to receive them. The return was easy, and they paid for the return shipping too. I did reorder the Diaper Dekor PLUS refills hoping those are the right ones. You can also get a $5 first time order discount through diapers.com."
3,Scented bags,"The bags are strongly scented with a baby powder scent. I put the liner outside as soon as I opened it, hoping it will air out. Others may like this scent - but I just can't stand it. I am hoping to find something unscented to use with the Diaper Dekor."
1,Refills don't work.,"I can't begin to convey the frustration I felt when trying to use the refill. I struggled for 20 minutes trying to slip the too-tight bag over the cartridge. The Diaper Dekor works wonderfully as a single-use item, but at about $30-40 a pop, it is the most expensive garbage can outside of Ted Kozolowski's apartment. The printed instructions were clear-- it's just that they product does not do what it supposed to do."
1,Diaper Dekor Refills-- What a challenge!,We cannot get the refill bags into our Diaper Dekor Plus. Are there different size bags depending on whether you got the regular or plus unit? The lady in the store said NO so we bought 3 boxes of extra refills. Now we cant use any of them. What should we do?
2,The Music of Puerto Rico/Tribute to Rafael Hernandez,I was disappointed that this was an instrumental arrangement. I was looking for words especially for Mi Viejo San Juan. If I had been given an opportunity to listen to it (via internet) I would not have purchased this CD.
4,Needed More Control,"As a diehard Rangers' fan, I got this game to play, trade, and have fun. It was not much of an improvement over NHL 95, but it was good. I would have liked better free agency and more GM power. As for game play, the controls are easy and basic, but the graphics could have been worked on. I love the Stanley Cup Celebration. The skill levels are pretty accurate, and you should be a pro after 2 or 3 games. For a beginner, this is a good start to a good hockey game collection."
2,Not near as good.,"This is basically just yoor typical cash-in sequel. The few flaws from '95 have not been fixed and are just a lot worse. it looks terrible when compared with the 32X stuff, so do not buy. Even if you think it is a good deal, it is not fun."
3,Cute shoes,"Per typical shoes, these hurt the first few times I wore them I was surprised considering they are made by dr. scholls, but now they are perfectly comfortable and cute and I wear them all the time."
1,too expensive for what little you get,I don't like adhesives b/c the pads always flip and the sticky stuff on a sore nipple is like salt on a wound. These don't lay flat and they don't stick. They move around too much. I prefer evenflo b/c they don't hurt since there is no adhesive and they lay flat for me.
3,absorbs well but slips around,They are soft and comfortable with good absorption but the adhesive is very small and doesn't stick well. tends to slip around/ scrunch up easily in the bra.
1,These pads are so thick!,"They are soft, but pretty thick, I will never buy them again. They are also not in a shape of a nipple area, so it is visible for people through your outfit. And..they are small in diameter too. I want to try some more brands, but for right now I prefer Lansinoh.P.S. I tried Medela too and not satisfied by it - they loose their shape when absorb milk and I find it uncomfortable."
3,A good sequel.,"This is a good sequel, but it is not as fun as the games that follow it. The graphics have qutie a bit of work, and the gameplay needs to play a little catch-up. It is fun, but there are better games to come."
3,Good Story - Sloppy Writing / Editing,"Congrats to Frank M. Robinson for a good idea and page-turning plot. But the writing is often clumsy, and typos are littered throughout the published work. It makes you wonder what -- if any -- was the editing process involved. How can a finished work have THAT many errors in it? And how many times and ways can coffee be used as a ""literary device"" in one novel? One can only conclude that Mr. Robinson is either (a) obsessed with coffee or (b) the victim of no outside editing. At any rate, it's a very imperfect, but still pretty enjoyable read. It can also easily be pictured as the basis for a movie screenplay."
5,Excellent Thriller - 5 Stars for The Donor,"This is the first book I have read by Frank Robinson, but it will not be the last. I was very impressed with his storytelling. The characters are very strong, and you really get to know them. The plot is constantly changing, and it just an exciting read. I would reccomend this book to anyone wanting a great Thriller. Great Job Frank!"
2,OK,"I recieved my product quickly within 2 days! There was nothing wrong with the product except it doesn't come with a long enough wick. The actual holder is awesome and what I was looking for but I would have paid more if I could have gotten enough wick in the same order....Good holder, not enough wick!"
2,High shipping,"Shipping was very prompt, it took 2 days to receive the items. I use these to make oil lamps out of wine bottles and these wicks are very short for this. Also the shipping rate was very high, I bought a gallon of lamp oil elsewhere for about the same shipping rate."
2,Wick Holder,"These are just what i was looking for to make some candles out of whiskey bottles. the problem with them is that the hole through which the wick is placed is not uniform from holder to holder and some of them are much too large to hold the wick. some of them are so large that even with the top of the wick flared out, gravity alone will pull the wick easily out of the holder."
1,Had Major Problem!,The wicks do not stay in place in the glass tube.The tube is too wide and the wick falls out easily.I am returning them.
5,Glass Wick holders look great,"These glass wicks arrived promptly and were in good shape, none were broken. They look great in my glass bottles, I like the conical top which gives the over all shape a nice look."
2,Fractures when burning wick,The first time I ordered this I did not test the product before putting in my craft projects. This time I burned the wick and it fractured/melted the insert. I believe I will go back to the button type if I can find them.
3,A little small,The head is a little small for the wine bottles i bought it for. It should come with a suggesstion to get wax or molding to accomendate for the space so it doesn't wiggle for obvious safety reasons. Of course it can't be multiple sizes and you get quite a few for the money. They come threaded and I appreciated this . It appears to be good wick and the clear plastic ensures it matches any bottle you use.
1,Not Useful,These would be great to use in the wine bottles but the wick is WAY too SHORT and I cant find any longer any where to replace it so I wont be able to use these in the bottles.
2,wick holdoer,"For the price I guess they were OK. They are small and fragile. of the 12 in the box, 5 were broken. We did not contact the seller so I have nothing to report about them. The wicks were not long enough to reach the bottom of a wine bottle. We purchased them to use in wine bottles. They do not fit well in wine bottles. They just kind of sit in the mouth. The neck of the holder is too small."
3,PUZZLE,"WARNING! This DVD features the orignal Spanish language version as well as the English dubbed version. That is all fine and great, except, with the orignal Spanish version there are no english subtitles?!? What is the point?Good quality otherwise. Too bad."
4,"Comforting, Relaxing Tape","This is a wonderful tape consisting of two thirty minute guided visualations and autohypnosis. It is outstanding and I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially someone in emotional pain. Dr. Siegel's voice is wonderful in and of itself. His voice is comforting, loving, and gentle. I also really love the music that accompanies each meditation. I have never listened to this tape and not felt better afterwards. I sometimes fall asleep during the tape just because the music is so relaxing and his voice is so gentle. Consider this tape if you have past hurts in your life that are causing you pain now."
5,an excellent piece of work be Dr. Siegel,I use this audio cassette almost every day. It is a real inspiration. Well done be Dr. Siegel.
5,Really a spiritual guide,"This book is by far and away my favorite all-time book. I have read and re-read it so many times...it is truly wonderful. It is really more of a spiritual guide to building in the woods, although the simple plans are chock full of great ideas. There isn't anyone who loves the ""great out-of-doors"" that won't love this book."
5,"Perfect in the 1940s, ideal in the 2010s","This is one of those perfect, wonderful books. Not only does it cover the practical (for 1940s) aspects of building a cabin in the woods, but it also focuses on the real benefits of having a place to escape to.I love the full features of the book, from the plans for cabins to the practical application of how to build a fire pit, to the most important part, the attitude. The book has a great section discussing the attitude and demeanor you need to have in the outdoors. All of this is presented in a well written and folksy way, almost like the wise old outdoors man sharing his love and wisdom with a student"
5,A design for living,"I picked up an original copy of Your Cabin In The Woods many years ago and read it thoroughly over the course of about six months. In the following years of marriage (and divorce)(twice)raising a family and moving accross the country I lost track of this book and have no idea where it went. After surviving a serious illness I moved back to the Maine woods where I decided I would make the most of my time on the planet. After a futile search for the lost copy I found the book on Amazon and ordered one for myself.After reading it again I decided it would be an appropriate gift for my two grown daughters as a guide to survival in a world gone mad. ""Meinecke offers practical, affordable and sane advice on how to make our own little heaven, our own Cabin in The Woods. Everyone I have shown my copy has ordered one , or more, for themselves or their loved ones. I may have to buy more as gifts for my friends who share my spiritual journey."
2,Predictable and Marginal,"This recording represents another release of Maslanka's music by the University of Arizona Wind Ensemble, and it comes up rather short in places. The ensemble lacks fine precision at times, and the intonation is very suspect. Joe Lulloff's playing in the saxophone concerto is riddled with pitch problems (most notably in the 3rd Mvt) and it is a wonder why this was ever released. Maslanka appears to regularly quote himself and essentially re-compose much of his output from previous material, leaving the saxophone concerto, in particular, to sound predictable and tired. Further, it bears such resemblance to other works that one loses what makes it unique. A valiant effort with some sporadic good playing, but the music is average and the soloists are less than spectacular."
5,geuss what,"A little known fact about the premiere of the sax concerto, Lulloff had 2 weeks to prepare the peice for the premiere performance, Kelland Thomas had untimely nerve damage, causing someone else to come in to perform the work. I wanna see how well you play a 42 minute peice on 2 weeks notice."
4,it's different for claudio. don't expect coheed x 2.,"Complete with a stylish collection of tarot cards which serve as the album booklet, this album easily has our pick for featured album cover of the month. But although the album artwork is beautiful, it gives the impression that The Prize Fighter Inferno is a hardcore or cheesy metal band. What the band really is is the side project of Coheed and Cambria vocalist, Claudio Sanchez. The Prize Fighter Inferno plays heavily with electronica, and although Thom Yorke and The Postal Service heavily use electronica, Claudio's version is different. It seems to draw upon less conventional rock n' roll influences, including old school funk, pop, and ambient electronica, to create a diverse and unique album."
1,Not Very Good,"I love Coheed and Cambria. Love `em. Definitely in my top 5 favorite bands. But this... I don't know, it sounds like Claudio got locked in a room with a synthesizer and the only way he could torture his captors into hopefully releasing him was by playing terrible music. This is not an acoustic solo album like some other people have hinted at. The few guitar songs that are there remind me of Simon and Garfunkel, but with Michael Jackson singing over it.Pass on this abysmal album, and go get Coheed and Cambria. All of it is much, much better."
3,Postal Service Claudio Style,"I'll have to agree that this album is most easily explained as The Postal Service: Claudio Sanchez Version 2.0. It's not bad at all. It's no Coheed but it's just as easy a listen as The Postal Service and worth checking out for sure. Some of the slow ones do lose your interest, but the catchier songs are placed well enough on the track list than you won't take the album out before it ends. 3 1/2 stars out of 5."
2,um....Postal service?,Apparently this is more of the story from Jesse's point of view. He is a boxer and his name is inferno....hence prize fighter inferno. How clever. Sorry but the dancey stuff sounds to postal service like to me and the acoustic tracks are kinda boring. Very uninspiring album. Anticipated alot more. Maybe this will grow on me but as of right now I would assume to just stick with Coheed and read the lyrics to this just to get more perspective on the story.
5,"Awesome CD, not for the closed minded.","Honestly, not for close minded people. If you're not open minded you probably won't like this. Many different genres mixed in here, awesome CD."
2,not enough info,"otogo zoshi is in 2 distinct different time periods. the first ""season"" is a decent flick. not great. takes place in teh 1800's. 2nd season is taking place now and is just wrong. hard to follow. just a crappy purchase."
2,Needs reinforcement,"I have used this trap for about two years and have trapped about 30 raccoons. In two cases the raccoon was able to pry the mesh away from the frame on the door and escape. I reinforced with wire after both cases. Otherwise, ease to use and stable."
1,I was not impressed,I was not impressed with this book. I put it out for anyone who wanted to take it. Several students glanced through it and moved on. Two took it home and brought it back.
2,bookReview,This book has a lot good for crafters and youth group leaders but it was a disappointment because I wanted it to have more about painting. The title says painting but most of it can be done with markers.
1,Worst book I have ever bought on Amazon.,The graphic on the front of this book have little to do with tge demonstarations inside. I would not have purchased the book if I would have seen this I have never been so disappointed. Don't buy this book if you think the front cover is what you are going to get a lot of those examples. North Light should be ashamed!!!!
2,"Meh, its okay for a handheld version","The game plays like the computer version with some changes due to the size of the screen and whatnot.My main issue is that the computer is too dumb. Even on level ""5"" they vacillate between incredible shots and self damage.I only paid 8.80 for the game total so not a big loss, but still not even worth that. For true worms aficionados this isn't for you. Just keep playing it on the computer."
4,"OK, not as good as it could be but not bad.","I'll keep this short, the game isn't bad. There are only a couple of problems with it. The first problem is lousey AI. I saw a worm sit for maybe 5 turns in a row while sitting right next to one of my worms. Anything short of a stick of dynamite wouldn't have hurt it a bit; it could have used a Dragon punch even, but it just sat there doing nothing. I also did see one glitch, the computer's turn didn't end after it attacked; the attack ended when the timer ran down.The second problem is the ninja ropes. That's one of the biggest things in the PC version and it's almost worthless in the GBA version. They've let the worms jump higher now to compensate, but it's a big loss to have those handled so poorly.All in all, this is a game I'd recomend for the price. If they'd done it right it would be the best GBA I have, but as it stands it's still in the top three. The game is worth it."
5,This game rocks,this is wanna of my fovorite games on the dreamcast. and if its as good as it was on dreamcast this we'll be one of the best strategy games you can buy on game boy advance my guess is that you can play multiplayer and if you get a friend to buy it to It'll be even better in other words buy this game I hope this review is helpful to you.
3,Game,"the game is quite nice but there a plobelm, the game is not flexible and it can't save. Also the terain generater is not good at all."
5,Bulter Creek Eyepiece Flip Open Scope Cover Excellent Product,This is one fantastic scope cover and just one flick of my finger opens it.You can't go wrong with this scope cover. It's durable and sure protectsyour eye piece.
5,"The Journal of Jesse Smoke : A Cherokee Boy, Trail of Tears, 1838 (My Name Is America)",The book was a book of triumph and struggle. It tells the sad story of native americans and how they were frced of of there land because of the white man( power to the people . it is a great book and i highly recomend it..
4,The Journal of Jesse Smoke: A Cherokee Boy,"I read The Journal of Jesse Smoke. The author of Jesse Smoke, the owner of the journal. The book is historical fiction. It is about about a boy named jesse Smoke. He is apart of a Cherokee tribe. Jesse Smoke is Cherokee and has 2 sisters and a mother. His father had died and he does the work around the house. He owns this journal and wrights in it, it mainly takes place in camp Cherokee when he is captured and brought there. Many die there, he makes friends with a soldier named Will who gives information in camp. They get to leave when they pay for a pass to leave Camp Cherokee. I liked this book alot. I recommend it to people who like history. It is also recommend for people who like Indians or Cherokees. It is also for ages 12-adult. This book is good for people who like to read peoples journals."
1,Keep looking,I just received this mattress an hour ago and it is now being boxed up to go back. The plastic buckles that hold the mattress in a closed position break when you look at them. What good is a camping mattress that won't stay compact when not in use?
2,One night stand,mat worked good for the one night it held air also the retaining straps for when you roll it up the buckles broke o n both.
5,Excellent Purchase,I purchased this mattress for my boyfriend. I have had and used this product for many years (the shorter version). He is just starting to get into the excitement of backpacking. When he saw how much I liked my mattress he was interested in one...and he loves it!Your sleep is one of the most important things whether at home or in the back country. This mattress keeps you off the cold ground and allows a restful nights sleep. Just open the valve...let it do its own things and you are ready to go with a self-inflated matress.
1,Not reliable,"Its difficult to roll the mattress small enough to secure it with the straps. The second time I used it I was following Texsport instructions to get the excess air out by rolling it up with the valve open and then again with the valve closed until you got close to the valve. While doing that one of the tuffed spots popped causing a leak. I patched it but havn't tried using it again and I'm conerned about reliability now. Since I was following Texsport instuctions I consider the problem a manufacturing flaw, but since I don't have the box any more and there was no warranty info provided, returning it for a replacemnet doesn't look like an option. I would look else where for a better product."
4,Decent Mattress,"I'm a fairly tall guy - 6'2"" (1.88 m) and one thing that always bothered me about the small pads/mattresses was that my legs never got any support. This mattress was big enough for me to sleep comfortably. This mattress is heavier than the foam pads one would find at a local mega-mart (WalMart, Meijer, Kmart, etc.) but I think it's worth it! My only concern with this product is that it doesn't compact well. After I roll it up, it has a diameter of 10-12 inches (25-30 cm); making it bulky and sometimes hard to control."
2,Inflated?,"Bought this for a week long backpacking trip. Cleaned a spot, shook out a ground tarp, and pitched a brand new tent on the tarp. Inflated the mattress and hit the sack, then I hit the ground. The mattress leaked right out of the box. I manually blew the mattress up repeatedly through the night, but to no avail. Went back to pine boughs and did fine. Won't buy from this vendor again (price point was the motivator, but even then it shouldn't leak). This is the second mattress from the same company to perform the same. Shame on me twice!"
1,Would be good if it didn't leak,"I bought two of these. They were nice, except that they developed leaks within a couple of nights of use. I was not able to get the leaks sealed using the patches they provided, so I am throwing these in the trash after just a couple of uses."
3,"Me, Dead Dad, & Alcatraz","Me, Dead dad, and Alcatraz is a book about a boy who has lost his father. He now is raised by his single mother. He later finds out that his uncle (dad brother) that his mother said to be dead was sitting in his living room very much alive. The uncle spends time trying to get the boy to like him and make up for the time that he wasn't there for.I would recommend this book to others because anyone can relate to it. It's filled with humor and humanity. The book is very detailed and has a creative mind behind the story. This is a novel about finding yourself and redemption. The only dislike I had about Me, Dead dad and Alcatraz was that the suspense of the story wasn't really there everything just came out knowing it was bound to happen."
2,Not worth it.,"This book was big on general thoughts and contains very little detail and I do mean very little detail. It is more of an over reaching strategy survival book that could probably have been condensed to half as many pages or less. Furthermore, most authors or authorities on subjects are opinionated, but Mel took the cake and could not entertain the idea that he might be wrong about something, which for me is a little annoying. Especially since he was completely wrong about the imminent collapse of the US (12-18 months he wrote in 1980)."
2,Outdated and light on useful survival information,"While the content of this book is OK, it is very outdated. For example, a good portion of the book is devoted to guns and choosing a survival gun but there is no mention of the popular Glock handguns or the .40 S&W caliber. Obviously this is because neither of these were around in the 70's when Tappan was writing these articles. So for a similar up-to-date discussion of survival guns, I recommend Boston T. Party's Gun Bible. The other chapters are not as out of date, but are pretty light on actual information and recommendations about what and how to prepare. I recommend reading the articles online instead of buying this book."
4,A classic of the genre.....,"A true classic of its period, this survival manual suffers from the advancement of survival technology.It's old and much of the information offered is now outdated, but it's still worth reading, if only for its view of what the survival movement was all about in its infancy."
4,Old but still relevant,"Tappan's book may have been originally published in the early 80's, but his concepts are still pertinent. This book is a compilation of his articles written in a gun magazine in the 70's, so some of the information is dated. However, this book is still en excellent introduction to preparedness, and some of his ideas still echo down into today's preparedness books. An excellent beginner's first book for their preparedness library."
2,Deceptive advertising,"This tape is advertised as wetpruf as the same tape my physical therapist uses to tape up my Achilles. However, unlike the Kendall wetpruf this tape is a 2nd rate item that DOES NOT resist water or sweating. This is the second time this vendor has sent me an inferior product. DO NOT buy athletic tape from this vendor. Sorry I am just speaking the truth. I wish it were different."
4,the Fugitive,"I bought the 4th and Final season, Vol;2 becausewhen it was on TV in Melbourne, for some reason itwas not shown so I had not seen the ending.It was great to catch up and see how the series ended.IAN DRINKWATER"
5,Request,This may seem like a strange request. From previous comments it seems that many reviewers have watched all the episodes from the previously released Fugitive seasons. Does anyone remember an episode where Act 1 opens with Dr. Kimble walking down a city street or alley at night in a driving rain before entering a building? for some reason I distinctly remember the opening scene but do not know the name of the episode or the season it is from. Any help is appreciated.
5,Great job of reproduction,The reproduction of this series from the old films to DVD is excellent. It's hard to find quality classics done so well.
3,"Fun game play, but season doesn't save","Games is cool, brings me back to the old days. But you cannot save your season. Must be a glitch with this copy or something."
4,Great book for sports fans,"This was a Christmas gift for our adult son. He loved the book, but the CDs that were to be a part of it were not included!"
5,Godly Italian Prizznog...Yadadamean?!?!?!,"Alphataurus is music for ill cat-heads..this obscure group from the early 70's Italian Prog Rock scene provide the kind of music that lifts you from the depths of sorrow to the highest point of ecstacy one could wish to experience..and vice versa..the epic ""La Mente Vola"" is the one gem here, if one were forced to just pick ONE..it is a song for children and wilderbeasts..however, the entire album is something to behold, and must be peeped by all ages and lifeforms..typical PROGRAM 11 music, if you follow my meaning. Do yourself a favor and acquire this immacculate album as soon as is humanly possible, your inner god will thank you for it.-Dr. Gonzo, PHDizzle"
5,To Think for Yourself or Not to Think for Yourself,"In a post-atomic war Inhabited Island of a planet, in a totalitarian dictatorship where black is known to be white and good is known to be evil, an average Joe youth from anarchic-meritocratic Earth of 22nd century must find his way among many lies, to decide what's true and what's truly important. An enthralling journey."
1,"Awful, awful, awful","This game is just horrible. Levels are boring and uninspired. Player control is weak (jumping, using magic). Enemies are not difficult to beat, just annoying (they instantly come back). Gameplay is repetitive. Destroy a flower, then another, and another, and another... And the character ""dialogue"" started repeating within seconds. Even cheap as this game is, it's not worth it. I had read it was like Spyro (which I think is a great game, clever with very smooth control), which is why I got it, but it's nothing like Spyro, it's just lousy and boring."
2,Too much trouble for the reward,"This game could have been so much better if it weren't so dang impossible. The controls don't help; they're hard to get ahold of. The enemies' constant regeneration wears on your nerves after a while. Also, some of the scenery is so dark, you can't actually see what's going on.The only way I could get past the second stage is by cheating.(For those who are interested, save game as SUPREMEMAGIC and you become invincible and with limitless magic. Once you're invincible with unlimited magic, the game becomes the tiniest bit less impossible.)The movie sequences are about ten seconds long, and there's a lot of frustrating game play in between.If you can get it cheap, go ahead and try it."
1,Idea was good but poorly done,I traded this game in because the action and such just wasn't enough and the controls where hand to deal with it is not worth the cost
2,How monotonous!,"Wow. The controlls are really hard! One side of the controller contols the unicorn and the other side controls the mage. If that wasn't difficult enough, dying is quite easy as if you don't destory the enemies in a certain amount of time, they come right back. Although you do have an unlimited number of lives, it gets annoying after a while.On that note, you run around saving flowers! Okay, that was fine for the first four levels, but after that, I quit. The whining ever-repeating diolouge of the charecters got old quick.How can anybody play it through to the end? The storyline was okay, a little weak but okay. The little book that came with it was more interesting!"
1,Very disappointed with the readability of this book,"While I haven't read the book yet and am not at all commenting on the value of the content, I was shocked when it arrived and I opened it up to thumb through it to notice that it doesn't appear to even have been typeset, but photocopied. It is VERY difficult to read. Many of the illustrations are so highly contrasted that they are difficult to view in any detail. I'm guessing that the publisher simply digitally copied the hardcover version of this book, though I'm not certain about that. Whatever the method of creating it, I would suggest either purchasing a hardcover copy if you can find one or wait for this one to come out on the Kindle (if you have one), as the other two volumes of this trilogy are already available on the kindle. I'm hoping that I don't have the same problem with the typeface on the kindle, though given the poor quality of this book it may take me years to get through it and on to 2nd volume."
4,"Amazing novel, doesn't spare the reader a thing.","The loneliness and reality portrayed in this book is unforgettable. It has been a year since I've read this book and I can't forget Chuck, his story, and alienation. Not a word is wasted; even the chapter titles add to the flesh, blood, veins, and human emotion depicted in this book. Through the character of Chuck, Allen makes his point about romance, New York, meat, and people with poignancy and without apology."
5,remarkable prose,"Ed Allen writes as beautifully and as haunting as Nabokov. Read this book as well as his other novel, Mustang Sally, and you'll know what I'm talking about. Great stuff."
3,A Heartwrenching Tale . . .,"This book cut right to my heart. The book overall is a downer, but the progression of the main character is significant. It made me wonder how far that I could be from his long series of disappointments and experiences in my own life experience. It is realistic and heart-wrenching. One wonders how many people suffer his fate in our society today."
2,A tale of a loser and despair...,"Edward Allen's attempt at literary fiction both disappointed and angered me. In this tale, a loser(and that's the only name for a guy who gave up college for a stupid reason) named Chuck Deckle tries to eke out an existance doing butcher work. He was insprired by some cartoon(a hallmark of a loser). But alas, he is taken advantage of and marginalized. I would feel bad for Deckle's predicaments more if I didn't feel he was such a loser that needs to grow up. Allen sure knows more about kosher butchering than the average joe. The nasty Jewish owner of a kosher slaughterhouse is quite stereotypical of our worst fears."
5,"""For Women of all backgrounds""","This is an excellent book for women of all backgrounds. It is written in plain language, is easily understandable, and covers both the usual and the unusual questions that women have about their pregnancies."" ---Dr. Anthony Caggiano, Jr., NJ Section Chair, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist and former president, Medical Society of New Jersey."
4,Intense emo with serious potential,"This CD simply rocks. Strike Force is a band of college age kiddies who are doing things with the conventional dual guitar/bass/drums/voice package that I consider simply revolutionary. As Dina's lovely voice croons softly, the band slowly and quietly builds up disarming tension only to explode in the listener's face with such frightening intensity that it's hard to sit still. It's the kind of music that makes you want to punch your best friend in the face. I like it. Give me more."
1,Worst TECMO Super Bowl game ever!!,They took a great game and totally ruined it. Every thing about Tecmo Super Bowl II is superior by leaps and bounds to this game. There is nothing good about this game. I paid $20 to check it out. Wouldn't pay more than $5 after playing the game.
2,get what u paid for,do not buy this item. i bought it cause it was cheap.but there is air leaking from the side of gun plus every 10 shots it shoots double.so i end up spending all my time pulling out the extra nail.gun jams every 50 shots.
1,never buy this car,This was the worst model I have ever seen. The first time that I have bought something off of this web site and it is the last! when I opend the package an orange gooo dripped out. enough said!Just kidding its an awasome model with awasome detail!!!
1,Lacks direction,"I purchased this book as it was required for an operations management class (undergrad). Therefore, because of this, I had no choice in the purchase. Having said that, the book itself is terribly written. It bolds words that it doesn't ever properly define--as if it expects you to know the meaning to begin with or wants you to try to muddle out the meaning from the poor context. It also refers back to those undefined words and says, 'As defined in the previous paragraphs.' It does not define those words in the back of the book either, leaving you with a vague feeling that the book should have been edited better or at least not cost quite so much. The greatest assumption in this book seems to be that you already knew the information, which is, of course, impossible if you have never taken any classes about operations management. In short, unless you are forced to purchase it, it is not worth reading."
1,OM review,"Dull, dry, and too technical. I would not recommend this book and hope professors find other books when teaching grad courses pertaining to management."
4,Yet another good game from Sega.,"This game is another quality title from Sega. It is not as good as NHL '95, but it is still an incrdbible amount of fun for the player. The gameplay is solid and fast, and it is a lot of fun. A great game."
2,Disappointing,"I was eagerly anticipating being able to play some of my favorite arcade games from the early 1980s. Unfortunately, the reality of playing them on a Gameboy is sorely disappointing.The trackball-based games, Centipede and Missile Command, are the biggest letdowns. Using the Gameboy's directional control to emulate a trackball just doesn't work. Centipede works adequately at first, but the inability to make swift moves quickly becomes a handicap. Missile Command is just unplayable. In the arcade version I would typically get a five-figure score; on the Gameboy I'm lucky to make it past the first level.Battlezone is okay, but the small screen makes targeting much too difficult. I never played Super Breakout in the arcades, but as with Missile Command, the awkward controls make it nearly impossible. Asteroids and Tempest are probably the most successful of the bunch, but that isn't saying much.The Atari trivia game is just bizarre. Do people really know the names of Atari's designers?"
4,The Classics never die!,"OK, classic gamers, if you've been holding off on getting that Gameboy Advance, you're running out of excuses! Atari Arcade Advance is a near-perfect gaming experience for those of us that used pump quarters into arcade machines back in the early 80's. All the translations are faithful, and the trivia game is pretty fun. I especially love being able to take TEMPEST with me anywhere! The only minor complaint I have is with the controls. The Gameboy's directional keypad makes trackball games like MISSILE COMMAND and CENTIPEDE a bit problematic. But you'll get used to it, and there's really no reason not to add this to your collection."
5,great classic games,"I'm old fashioned and grew up with Atari games, so this was great. Bought it several years ago and have now gotten an ipod touch so I don't really play with it much anymore though."
3,Great Presenation,"I felt the presentation of this book was great and there are a lot of unique recipies. I did try to make the blueberry shortbread and had a problem with it. The consistancy was just not there. After reading someone's else's review here on Amazon, I see I was not the only one who had a problem and perhaps there was something left out of the recipie?I also tried the cake on the front cover which everyone did love, but I have to say that it made way more cake batter than the pan size and even though I didn't use it all it overflowed all over the oven. I would say that this cookbook may be for someone with a little more experience than a beginner who is not used to anticipating or judging when things don't look quite right! The choc. cake and topping was a big hit though regardless of the big mess in my stove!!"
3,Needed more photo's.............,"This is a good book but in my oponion, photos make the difference between a good cookbook and a great cookbook. Yes, Ms. Gand is a grand pastry chef but when I look for a cookbook, I want to see pictures, lots and lots of accompanying pictures. There is a mid-section with a selection of photo's of certain desserts but it doesn't mean much if out of many recipes, only a few are selected for a visual tour. I want to see what I am preparing to create; the recipe titles sound good but how is it supposed to turn out? I own over 500 books and I truly feel that photo's make the sale; if I was a professional baker, then I suppose I wouldn't be needing them. But I am a home baker, and that's basically who these type of books are for."
4,Great Party/Shower Resource!,"Regardless of your occasion, theme, party size, budget and diet restrictions you're almost certain to find some great menu ideas in Just a Bite! Passing up complicated and fancy in favor of cute and bite-size, the author (a pastry chef) shares some of her favorite and most popular options. Most recipes don't require special pans, strange ingredients or anything else your average home baker can't do.The small size of each piece means you get a lot more bang for your buck, and many of the small cakes and cookies can be made ahead and frozen to stash as back-up for last minute entertaining or to give you a head start during busy weeks. I highly recommend this one!"
2,returned,"After looking through this book, I found these weren't the types of recipes I woul make. It was a nice book, just not what I was looking for."
2,Disappointment,I bought this book because I wanted technical detail on log home building. It does not do a good job of this. It seems to be a mix of advertisements and testimonials. No meat!It's only value is in the photography. Some beautiful homes shown.
4,"Useful read, but one-sided and not scientifically compelling","This is a good book to read, just to get a different perspective on dreams and dreaming (as previous reviewer mentioned). It is a religion- based (namely, Christian religion) point of view... and you can guess for yourselves, which one it would be. I liked this book, nonetheless, because being interested in the subject, I opened up my mind to every kind of perspective. But I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, because, at times, it simply gets boring."
5,Excellent. New insights found nowhere else.,"Kallmyer discusses dreams from a perspective not found in any of the other published books about dreams. He warns readers that the dreamscape is sought after by malevolent forces. To wit, not all dreams are good. In fact, heeding counterfeit dreams is something we desperately need to safeguard ourselves against. A MUST read for anybody interested in dreams and dreaming."
4,My first Portmeirion pieces,"This creamer, along with the ""romantic"" sugar bowl are my first Portmeirion pieces. They look well made and are beautifully finished. I have to say, they are off-white, maybe cream (?)- not bright white. Just thought you should know that in case you're mixing & matching.I look forward to adding to my collection."
1,Batting Tee Review,I purchased 5 of these for our school's PE department. I am very disappointed with the design. Franklin has added some new technology at the end of the tee....some squiggly rubber strands which are supposed to support the ball. My tees arrived and all of the strands were compressed to the point where they won't support a ball at all. My only option is to insert the tubing upside down and set the ball on the other end which is just a straight cut rubber tube. Very difficult for young children to stabilize the ball on this surface. Wish I had purchased ANY other style.
1,Not a good product,Franklin Sports 2774 MLB Heavy Duty Professional Batting Tee is not a good product. After 2 days of use the home plate (base of the tee) began to brake apart. I would like Amazon to stand by the product that they sell and replace it with a new one. If you need a picture please let me know.Thank youMelvin Betancourt
3,Handy But Noisy,"I've been using my Soyabella for over four months, and, overall, I'm glad to have it. It's easy and convenient to use, and it takes only about 15 minutes. However, it's (briefly) very loud, and cleaning it isn't as easy as using it. Although the recommendation is to clean it promptly after use, it's too hot to handle at first. All parts must be washed by hand, and it's tricky to keep the plug-in place for the cord dry. As for the finished product, it has a beanier flavor and is not as creamy as Silk Soymilk (which contains carrageenan), and it contains a grainy sludge that sinks to the bottom of cup or pitcher. I was filtering out this residue at first, with cheese cloth and a fine sieve, but that procedure was slow and bothersome. Now I'm used to this sediment (but I wouldn't serve it to company)."
1,Better pads are available,"I love the Avent system and have just about everything they make. Their bottles are the only thing that my son will drink out of. Their breast pads, however, are not up to par with the rest of their merchandise. They are extremely bulky so everyone knows you are a nursing mother and don't cover enough area of the breast to make them invisible under a shirt. Not only that, but they have a tendency to shift, especially at night, which can cause leaks. All in all, when this box is done, I'll be going back to the Lansinoh pads which are much thinner, more absorbant, and offer much better coverage."
2,Big Breast = Leaky Mess,"If you are a large breasted woman like myself, not only will these ridiculously tiny breast pads make you look like you have 4"" diameter swollen areola underneath your bras and shirts, but you will need to change them almost as frequently as you nurse your child or else suffer from wet spots on your shirts. I have been woken several times in the middle of the night by the discomfort of laying in a wet spot of breast milk on my bed since these pads didn't get the job done. I'll give them props on the comfort aspect, but they just aren't practical for women on the go..."
3,itchy,"I had used these pads with my first son 3 years ago. I had no problem with them with him, so bought it again with my second child.They have changed the design from a few years ago. The one thing I do not like is the excess trim around the pad. If I don't bend it outwards, the pads tend to be itchy and uncomfortable.Thus far, they haven't leaked."
1,Didn't Like,"I did not like these nursing pads. They were thick, small and not discreet at all under clothing. I also agree about the Lansionh breast pads, which you can get at ex: Wal-Mart. The Lansionh pads are thin, large, comfortable, discreet and very absorbent."
1,Do Not Use!,"I love Avent bottles and pumps, but I hate these breast pads. I ran out of my Lanisoh pads one day and found an Avent pad included with my Isis pump. I used one and not even an hour later I had leaked completely down my shirt. Very embarrassing. I highly recommend Lanisoh. They are comfortable and I don't even know I am wearing them."
1,Felt like wrong choice and despite of price it is eventually expensive.,"The description says it has countered shape. Sorry its not. It has a small falls in the center where your nipple should be placed and this does not help at all to fit properly. I got this in subscribe and save . 100 pads for 10 $. I thought I am getting a good value out of money , but these pads are not as absorbent as Medela (This is what I used in first month) and are way too thick to use under a shirt. I ended up using more than 4 daily. I finished the pack by using at nights and decided never to buy anything other than Medela that is for sure."
1,Horrible!,"I started out with washable pads, they didn't seem to work for me at all id just leak all over. I bought these disposable... and they just dont work for me, they dont absorb too well and the sticky parts dont work for a dang thing."
3,"Not the best, but they worked.","These are definitely not the best nursing pads out there, but they are probably the cheapest. They aren't as big as others I used and are a little more noticable. I probably wouldn't buy them again, I'd pay a little more and go with lansinoh or medela or johnson&johnson."
2,not so comfortable,The pads are bulky and small and they are not concealed very well. I personally did not like them and felt that they did not stay in place very well. You could see the outline of the pads under my shirt. I would not purchase these again.
4,Not as good as Lashinoh,"I think this is not as good as Lashinoh, cus Lashinoh is thinner. This one is not so sticky to my bra."
2,"Too thick, too small, not a fan","Many others have already pointed out the flaws. These pads are too thick, and too small. They are absorbent, but because of their size, you just don't get any peace of mind and are constantly worrying about whether they will shift around. I also find that despite their thickness and absorbency, I end up changing them more frequently then other pads. The outer lining of the pad disintegrates after one feeding, so you'll need the 100 pad box just to get through a few weeks."
2,"Too thick, visible under clothing","I did not like these pads at all. They are too thick, and unflattering under clothing. Also, some were saying that thick is good because it absorbs better, but there are thinner ones that absorb just as well! The medela are the thinnest and my personal favorite. Next best are the lansinoh, a little thicker but still doable...these are my least favorite."
3,Thought these were great until Lansinoh,"When I started nursing my second child, I thought these were great. I loved that thay had a tape strip to hold them in place, something the ones I used with child #1 did not have. I also thought they were better than the other brands that you find in the supermarket. The others stick to you and are uncomfortable to ""peel"" off. However, after reading other reviews, I tried the Lansinoh product. And, I must admit the Lansinoh pads are far better than any other."
2,Not big enough,"I had been using the Lansinosh pads(given to me by another breastfeeding friend). When I ran out, I decided to try these. They are way too small-and I don't have large breasts, so that's not saying much. They are absorbent-but that's the only good thing. They are bulky so forget about wearing anything formfitting-you'll see the pad. I'll be going back to Lansinosh."
2,I prefer the Lansinoh pads.,"I used to use the Avent pads until I discovered the Lansinoh pads. The Avent pads are thick and smaller and they show through your shirt. It's hard to disguise that you are wearing breast pads, which is kind of awkward. I also found that it tends to move (slightly) even when attached. It's okay to use at night because it is thick and it prevents leaks especially around morning time. But I prefer Lansinoh and that is what I use now even at nights. They are much better than the Avent pads."
2,They are ok...,"I found these pads are great in color and price. Since I am an active mom though, the adhesive - which makes this product stick to the inside of the nursing bras would make it bunch up inside and would not only be uncomfortable but would cause leaks. When I tried this product without using the adhesive it would move from its intended place and would again be uncomfortable or cause leaks. I am a big fan to Avent and I like most of their products, but I felt this just wasn't up to their normal standard."
2,my issue,i dint have a leaking issue with these but they didn't stay in place well. the one little strip of adhesive was not enough to keep them in place. Maybe it is b/c I am big breasted but these did not work (loved the Avent ones though)
1,Bulky and don't absorb enough to protect against leaks!,"Got these pads as a shower gift. They were ok to use in the first two weeks while I was at home during the day. When my baby started sleeping the whole night at 4 weeks, I was waking up soaked with these pads. I went out shopping once and also wound up wet. I changed to Lansinoh pads and they are great. Thin, large and absorbent. Now I'm happy."
4,They do the job,"I was trying out different breastpads, this among them. It came with a trial pair of the nighttime pads, they're thicker and worked great. The daytime version works very well, they're soft and cushy with a nice contour. They'd be perfect if there was a second sticky pad. As they are, they travel all over my bra or nursing tank and get flipped down when I go to nurse. It's a trial to get it back in place when I'm trying to 'zip up' after nursing, with a curious 4 month old looking and squirming around I'm fumbling with a bunched up nursing pad. In a pinch I'd definitely pick up a package but my primary will be lansinoh's disposables."
2,Used to be much better,I loved the Avent nursing pads when they used to be made in Switzerland. They were soft and comfortable. With my current baby I purchased the Avent pads again but found them to be rough and itchy. I looked on the box and they are now made in China. I prefer the Johnson's and Johnson's brand. They are soft and made in France. Not much more expensive than any other brands.
4,Best I have tried,"I have tried a few different brands of nursing pads as I am now breastfeeding my second child. These are by far my favorite. They are just softer and more absorbant than other brands I have used. These factors are really important especially in those first few weeks when nipples may be a little bit sore and there is a lot of leaking. I would give a 5 stars, but with a thin shirt on these are somewhat visible. To me this is a completely worthwhile trade-off to have soft, comfortable pads. Quite frankly, I am not wearing tight shirts in the post-partum period.Madela pads were less visible, but much less comfortable and less absorbant. They were too thin and plastic-like. They absorbed very poorly."
1,AWFUL,"THESE PADS ARE THE WORST....I LIKE THE GERBER DISPOSABLE PADS....THESE PADS DO NOT HOLD MUCH LEAKAGE, NOR DO THEY COVER ENOUGH OF YOUR BREAST...THEY ARE DEFINATELY A NUISANCE WHEN YOU GO TO FEED YOUR BABY...."
3,I Like Medela's Pads Better,"These pads are okay, but I hate how they look under fitted shirts due to their bulkiness. Also, I find the edges a bit rough on my skin, which is pretty sensitive right now. On the flip side, they are very absorbant and I have not experienced any leaks with them. Personally, I like Medela's pads better because they have a more flattering (but not perfect) silhouette under clothes and are thinner."
3,not so good,"I don't recommend these pads. Lansinoh's are much better:Lansinoh are larger, thinner, stay better in place and cheaper."
4,Good Pads,"These pads work well but the sticker on the back are a bit annoying b/c they won't stay in place. I bought some Evenflo pads after I finished up this box and found they were much more comfortable. Also, recently bought some reusable pads (washable) and they are even better! The Avent pads are good for starters but I prefer the reusable pads (then the Evenflo)."
2,good but visible protection,"These breast pads serve their purpose but are quite thick and can be easily seen through your clothes even if you are wearing a thick bra. I use them only when I don't have to leave the house, but for outtings I rely on Medela breast pads, very thin, perfectly absorbent and discrete."
1,terrible,As other reviewers said these are very small and the sticker doesn't work to hold them in place. The Lansinoh pads are much better.
2,itchy,"I hate to say it, but I found these to be very uncomfortable. I have not had any leakage issues, but I found the edges of these pads to be very itchy against my skin. They are a little thick also- good for leaking, bad for showing through your clothes. I have a large box of them- trying to think of another use."
2,Do the job but HUGE!,"I picked these up when my store was out of the Lansinoh pads and I was so disappointed when I opened the package. These suckers are huge and are incredibly visible through clothing. They keep me from leaking, but it's not worth it when I would never been seen in public with these in my bra. Lansinoh are much better!"
2,A Real Waste Of Money!,"I felt completely cheated when I purchased these nursing pads. Prior to using the Avent brand, my only experience had been with the Lansinoh brand. I tried Avent because I read that it was best not to use a pad with a plastic liner. I was completely disappointed with the Avent pads because not only are they very thick, I experienced a leak through almost every time I wore them. I prefer the Lansinoh brandLansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads, 60-packand will never purchase these again!"
1,"Too Thick, Too small, No Good!","There are so many problems with these pads, but I will keep it short.Pros: They're better than nothing.Cons: They are too small, too thick, visible through clothing, the sticky part is not adhesive enough. Leaves lint/fibers on the nipple. When you go to nurse your baby, the pad will either fall out, or just bunch up, then when you are done nursing you have to physically open up the pad and readjust, and they leak. I will most certainly stick with Lansinoh; bigger pad which means it is more evenly distributed under your clothing, the sticky part on the back actually is sticky, and I have NEVER had a leak with Lansinoh."
2,use lansinoh,a friend of mine purchased the avent and lansinoh pads. I used the lansinoh with no problems. I love how wide they are. But the avent is too small and too thick. With my nursing tanks these can be seen.
2,Small & thick,"I didn't like them.... They are too small and very thick, they show thru your clothes. I use instead the evenflow, they are very thin and larger than this."
1,Too thick and too small...,These pads are too thick and too small... I usedEvenflo 60 Count Simplyabsorbent Nursing Padbefore and liked them better. Will not buy Avent's anymore...
1,Sad fat and useless,"I wanted to like these pads. I really did. Maybe if I was an A cup (are there many A cup nursing moms out there???), or maybe even a B cup these just might work. No, sadly, I'm an E cup and these little cotton dots do nothing for my ginormous gals who have a mind of their own. They're very awkward looking through shirts and I've leaked big time with them. I've even tried the ole' add-2-or-more-per-cup-just-for-extra-protection-while-at-home trick and it still doesn't work well. My home-made up-cycled soakers do a better job 'cos at least those have a bigger 'target' area and can stay put without a useless little tab of sticky tape. I would go with the Lansinoh pads. Compared to these they're AMAZING!"
2,Too small,I love avent products but they weren't thinking when they made these. They are way too small and way too thick. Feels like a maxi pad.
5,LOVE these pads!,"GREAT pads! Soft, comfortable and thick enough for my strong flow! I have chosen these over all others for each of my three children, who I nursed for 16 months each."
4,Works fine!,"I never tried other brands, but I liked these Avent nursing pads very much. They fit my breasts, which are not big, very well and so far (I've been using them for 2 weeks now) they did protect me from leaks."
1,No good,These pads are too small and too thick. They fall right out of your bra when you go to nurse your baby. They also look very unflattering under clothing. I like the Lansinoh pads much better as they are thin and large which means they can be folded over when you open the bra flap to nurse. Don't waste your money on Avent pads!
4,I like these,"I prefer Avent breast pads to Gerber and Lansinoh as they are more absorbent, stay in place with adhesive and are really comfortable to wear. I found that Gerber pads leaked straight through and Lansinoh pads were too thin and I hated that wet and burning sensation when wearing them [I leaked a lot and the pads got soaked in minutes and were rubbing my nipples badly :(] Avent pads are realy cushy and soft, and they conform to the natural shape of the breast. They are also perfectly sized: had they been a little bigger, they would hardly fit in the bra. I think they are inexpensive enough for you to try (there're trial 2-packs and packs of 40 pads for less than $5 at Target and Babies'R'Us/Toys'R'us stores). I really like Avent pads better than any other disposable pads I tried. :)"
3,A little larger please!,"I honestly have to wonder what the manufacturer was thinking when they made these things so small. I am not a very large breasted woman (a 38 C to be exact) and I found these things to be too little. As long as I was relatively inactive all was fine but the minute I started doing something and they shifted even the slightest bit I would be leaking all over the place because they really don't offer too much coverage. And sleeping in these little things? Forget it! Your bed is bound to be a wet mess by the time you wake up.Add to this, the fact that the adhesive strip is placed at the top of the pad and you can see that their design needs a little work. Why didn't they put it in the middle? That seems most logical to me.So, all in all, if you can get them centered and keep them from moving then they will be pretty absorbant. BUT with a little nursling I think you've got enough worries without having to worry about embarassing wet spots on your shirt."
2,You Get What You Pay For..,"I thought, what a great deal - 100 pads for only $10 and the description on the box made them sound good but they are not. The pads are too small and the adhesive strip is even smaller and doesn't keep the pads in place. I've tried several brands over the past two months and quite frankly, the Gerber or Johnson brand pads are much better and worth the money - mainly because they are contoured and have a larger adhesive strip to the keep them in place. I now only use these Avent pads as backups at home in case of leaks."
1,Make nipples hurt,"I used these pads when I first started nursing. They did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes. However, my nipples were incredibly sore. When I took my baby to her first appt., the pediatrician suggested cloth pads. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! Yes, they did cause me to leak through a little, but that was needed. WHen ALL the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms. Don't use these. Buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath (I use the Imse Vimse)."
2,Not perfect,"While these pads are some of the softest (and most economical) I've seen, there is a lot of room for improvement. They are quite thick and look obviously strange under even baggy shirts. Also, when they get really saturated (like at night) they tend to leak all over the place. I have woken up many nights with my nightshirts and sheets wet. Try the Lanisoh pads instead. While they still show a bit under your bras, they are much larger (covers your whole breast instead of just your aerola) and thinner and I have yet to have one leak, even when its soaked."
3,Better than some but not the best,"Pros:- These pads retain their shape and don't ball up or shred after a few hours like the Medela pads do- They stay more or less in place even without using the adhesive strip- Absorbent - I've never leaked through the pad- Value for money - at $10 for 100 pads they're a decent buy- They don't show through under clothingCons:- They're a bit too small in diameter - even a little slippage (especially common at night) can cause the pad to be off the nipple- For those who like to use adhesive (I don't), the adhesive tab is so small that it's effectively uselessThe bottom line: While this pad is effective under most circumstances, it's not as good as my favorite pad, by ""The First Years."" Buy it if it's the easiest one for you to locate."
2,Barely do the job,"I tried these pads first after being so happy with other Avent products. Unlike other Avent products these pads are barely passable for the job. They are very thick, you can see them through clothing, the diameter is far too small so even a small shift and they will leak. After many leaks with these I switched to Lansinoh pads."
1,"small, thick, and leaky","I have tried several types of pads and these are the worst! They are very small, thick, and do not hold much, causing them to overflow and leak. I'd recommend the Gerber pads."
4,Pretty Good,"These are the first nursing pads that I've ever used, but so far so good. I have found them to be quite comfortable and they can hold a lot of liquid. I do change them often, but that is for my own peace of mind and comfort. It's not because of the pads. I would say that if you're having trouble with leakage, you might want to change them more often. I've also not had any problems folding them down to nurse. My only complaint might be that they can shift at night while I'm sleeping. I will definately continue to use these."
5,The only pad for a heavy leaker,"Yes, they are thick- that also means that they are super absorbant and for a heavy leaker like me, that is essential. All of my clothing that is tight enough to show the pad through is still in my closet so that's not a worry for me. The adhesive is pretty useless but again it doesn't matter for me as they seem to fit me just right (38C) adn don't move around. the Gerber pads (aside from being the only dry thing on my top half, were way too big and bunched up). At first they stuck to my nipple a lot, but that was when I was having serious cracking issues and I didn't know to dry them first before putting them away (the nipples not the pads)."
4,Super Comfortable,"I tried several types of nursing pads and found these to be by far the most comfortable. I never have a problem with leakage or ""fuzzies"" left behind by the pads. I actually had to throw away the box of johnson and johnson pads i had bought because they were so itchy and fuzzy, and i found the thinner types of pads to be too flimsy for me. While the avent pads are bulky, because i am not back into my normal slim-fitting clothes yet, i haven't had a problem with the pads showing through."
3,WAY too thick,"Unless you're wearing a baggy, bulky sweater, you can see the outline and the bumpiness of the pad underneath. Plus, the little dimple for the nipple--most people don't have nipples that are 2 mm in height!!"
5,"A CLASSIC,BUT WITH A FEW FLAWS","PRIMETIME BLUES is an excellent history of African-Americanson primetime television,from the days of ""Beluah"" to ""The Parkers"".Smart,honest,and very,very,very insightful,PRIMETIMEBLUES makes you want to read even more.But if I had to put insome complaints,it'd be Donald Bogle's political bias.Suggestingthat all Blacks live rough and that any Black show that wants toshow a normal,calm Black family is phony.And at times,PRIMETIMEBLUES comes off a textbook as well.But anyway,buy this bookfor excellent coverage of Blacks on your TV screen!"
5,FRESH PRINT,"What an excellent, thoughtful study of a worthwhile topic. Bogle is to first writer to acknowledge the shows that are the most influential in the history of African American television. Special credit should go to him for identifying ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" as the one truly groundbreaking show of the last thirty years. Much like that show, this book is thoroughly intelligent and well done from start to finish."
2,Encyclopedia of African American Television,"Donald Bogle outlines the roles of African Americans in television from the 1950s through the 1990s. I enjoyed reading about the shows of my childhood and reflecting on the social implications (that I was oblivious to at the time) these shows had and continue to have today. However, other than an instrument of reminiscence, the book offers few new insights into the industry and tribulations of the African American players in television. The book analyzes each show featuring African Americans on the small screen and production, seldom relating them. Primetime Blues serves more as an encyclopedia of African Americans in television than a thorough history."
4,Primetime Blues,"A highly comprehensive and detailed history of Blacks on television. Bogle is quite critical in his analysis of Black television - from the roles actors and actresses played to the actual sitcoms, dramas, and movies that were aired. As usual with Bogle's works, he always provides this reader with a name that I've never heard before, which compels me to do further research. While I may not always agree with his conclusions, he does present a worthy different point of view."
4,Oil lamp self contained,Cute little self contained oil lamp. Great if you want to push them into a cake for a party.
4,"There is better, but this is very solid.","This is not the best hockey game, but it sure is a solid buy. There are some stronger offerings from Sega and EA, but this game is a lot of fun. Graphics are strong, and help the game be very playable. There are plenty of teams and the gameplay is strong. The only dissapointment is that multiplayer is not at all strong."
5,One of the most interesting book in Veterinary Medicine,"A mine of information, very technical and thorough for all vets interested in alternative medicine and those who wish to learn more about it. I bought it 5 years ago and still have a lot of pleasure to read it again.Chapters after chapters, you fully understand that the holistic approach of a sick animal is the only worthwhile and that the complete cure is a reachable goal,not simply alleviate or mask symptoms like in the allopathic way. A book for what the future approach of patients and care will be in the 21st century.A veterinarian from Europe"
1,"Information, Please.","This is not a review of the product, but of its advertisement.There is no way a customer could make a decision to buy this product without some information about it besides its name and price. For instance, what is the size of the imprint area? Can it be fitted with different disks for different purposes? How are different disks ordered?"
5,When the Father Holds You Close,"This book helped me experience God in a whole new way. I had never really thought of myself as His delight, or considered that He would take joy in spending time with me. The book is very interactive as Cynthia Heald elaborates on the text and then provides space for the reader to record their prayers and what they hear God saying to them. I was very sorry to come to the end of the book."
2,DM's critics are now silenced . . . they fell asleep,"I'm amazed that something I find so visceral and intense can be rendered so bland.But I must be fair: Purcell at least has an intimate connection with the death metal scene. And she lets the musicians and fans speak, forging her critique from their experiences.The problem has little to do with her passion for the scene; she infuses the final chapter with an almost palpable desire. Her primary drawback appears to be her training in the number-crunching social sciences. I would love to see her approach to the topic if she were trained in an interdisciplinary field such as American Studies.Perhaps the book will be of some value, however, in explaining to my concerned wife why I dig this music as much as I do, since I've failed to do so convincingly so far."
2,not very good..,i could only read an hour here. its sad because i was hoping to use this in a personal ministry.
5,What can you say about squirrels?,"I gave this book to my daughter's college boyfriend for Christmas, not knowing what reaction I'd get. Well, he LOVED it! He thought the little vignettes were very cute and he didn't look at me like I was crazy. You might love this little book, too.Author of:Bad Girls Club"
3,"Cute, but it's no Bigfoot: I Not Dead.","I chose this book because I had so enjoyed Mr. Roumieu's Bigfoot books (especially ""I Not Dead"", one of the funniest books ever penned). This book does touch on the quirkiness of squirrels but does not really have the zing I have come to expect from Mr. Roumieu's work, and touches only lightly on the pathos of the squirrel-home owner relationship (whereby the cute little fluffy creature becomes the enemy of the lawn and the flinger of pinecones at unsuspecting passersby, though he does mention the whole chewing-into-the-attic phenomenon). Or perhaps the squirrels in my neighborhood are just a special breed of nasty."
4,A Really Super Book About Squirrels,I love Graham Roumieu! This book was cute but not nearly as funny as Roumieu's bigfoot books (probably because he only illustrated this one).
1,not what I hoped for,"This wasn't at all suitable for a regular sized Kindle. It was much too small to see and the cartoons were fuzzy. I got the Kindle for PC and had it sent there where I could see it, but it just seemed like there wasn't much to it."
3,"An enjoyable, but not a great, read","Abess Helewise discovers a dead body by nearly stepping on it. The man had been killed by a spear with a highly decorative point. Although the Sheriff is willing to blame the murder on the ""Forest People,"" a group who live and wander through the forest practicing pagan ceremonies, Helewise doesn't accept this. Enlisting the help of her friend Josse d'Acquin, they find poachers who've uncovered ancient treasure, pagan rituals, a link to two of the Abby's residents, a couple with ties to Queen Eleanor and death.While I like the characters of Helewise and Josse, the story left something to be desired. The anachronistic language was a bit disconcerting and there was one, I thought interesting, plot element that was dropped. The scene of the pagan ritual was perhaps more graphic than I needed, but did serve its purpose to the story. I did like that the author included both the new Christian and old Pagan beliefs without condemning either."
3,Mystery with a tingle of otherworldliness,"Great settings are just part of the charm of this good read. It gives you a pretty clear picture of the life of an abbey and the great forest that overshadows it. While not as descriptive of the inner beliefs of a medieval nun (compared to Sharan Newman's Catherine series!), the main characters of the Abbess and Sir Josse are attractive and there is just a hint of tension to spice it up. The eventual solution to the story is pretty standard-- but the Forest isn't completely without mysteries of its own. A good story even if you haven't read the first one!"
5,Second outing even better,"The second book in this wonderfully refreshing historical series is even better than the first.There is a cracking plot (concerning the ""forest people""), which moves along at a fair pace. It's interesting and very different. There is also, as another reader mentioned, a very definite sense of ""otherworldliness"" to the plot. Through the intense beliefs of the tree people, you start to somewhat acknowledge the possibility that maybe there is something in it after all...And this adds yet another layer of mystery and intrigue to the plot, above that of the actual crimes committed.the two lead cahracters are great and interesting. they are well developed, and their talents and deductive skills compliment each other well. They are a brilliant team. And, as well, Alys Clare REALLY knows her stuff about accurate historical detail. All of it seems very authentic.This is an exciting, intriguing book, with a great plot and some nice likeable characters. Definitely reccomended."
2,"The content is fine, the editor needs to do some research.","This collection of tales covers the globe and contains some delightful stories that explain the origins of things, but I would have appreciated tighter editing and better research on the part of the ""author"". I found two glaring mistakes: In one tale, Aphrodite, a member of the Greek pantheon, and Jupiter, a member of the Roman pantheon, both play parts. As one who studied the Greek Classics extensively, this mistake stands out as a whopper. In the introduction to the very next story, he mentions Uncle Remus as a source for African tales told by slaves, but since Uncle Remus is a fictional character, I question whether this editor's other works have any credibility whatsoever. The tales are fine, the compiler needs to go back to school."
3,Football mania,"NFL Football '95 is a good and fun. If you are a football fan you can pick your team, opposing team, field, and weather. So buy this game if you want to have fun!!!!"
3,"Not very instructional, mainly pictures of dolls","If you are looking for good instructions, it's not in this book. Mainly pictures of her dolls and a basic guide to modeling the Cernit."
5,A beautiful and informative book!,"Whether you are a beginner or a skilled artist, this book is a must. Not only is Rotraut Schrott an amazing artist, her step-by-step instructional photos are very clear and concise. Even if you are not an artist, the photos of her ""children"" will amaze you. Ms. Schrott creates the most life-like figures I have ever seen. She does not use molds of any kind. Each portrait figure is done entirely by hand, right down to the last detail of the clothing. She captures the soul of the child and conveys it in the expressions on their faces. It is hard to belive that the children in the beautiful, full color photos are not real. I can't say enough about this artist or this book."
4,SSG work gloves,Good quality but a little pricy comparing with the other prices over the internet. I will check the other prices before I buy next time
2,Unbelievably Poor Shipping Packaging,"My order of 3 cutters and six foil assemblies for a Braun razor was received today in unacceptable packaging, a soft 10x13 envelope with totally loose items enclosed with no rigid or boxed protection. The foil assemblies were loose, unprotected and mixed with loose cutters, all jumbled together..Two foils were slightly bent. If a box were to land on top of this envelope during shipping, all the contents would have been crushed. The cutters were loose with no wrapping whatsoever and the cutter blades were in constant contact with the loose foils allowing some damage to the unprotected cutting edges..This ""cross-your-fingers"" type of shipping reveals an unacceptably sloppy, off-handed and uncaring delivery of merchandise. Service like this is not acceptable for an Amazon merchant and lowers the bar significantly.A message, complaining to the merchant, remains unanswered.Amazon customers should be wary about this kind of service..--Joypebble"
3,Damaged,"This product was slightly damaged because the box was damaged. Not sure if it was weak packing or rough handling... It was still usable, but barely."
1,Numero Deux,This film was recommended by a friend. 3 minutes into the movie I threw it in the trash.
4,Great resource,We have already used this item for our current study. Great information on almost everything you can think of in the bible
1,Kindle Edition Unusable,"I returned the Kindle edition of the Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary. It is completely unusable as a Kindle reference since the individual articles are not indexed. If you wanted to read the article about sin, you either have to scroll through all the preceding articles beginning with ""S"" or scroll through 282 pages of search results. Either option is not acceptable. This was an extreme disappointment since the hard copy version is an excellent reference. I was hoping to add it to my Kindle pastoral library. Hopefully there is another Bible Dictionary that is Kindle friendly..."
5,Bible Dictionary Review,This text is an excellent reference source especially when used in relation to an OT or NT survey course. This book has a tremendous amount of material that further explain various aspects of the bible and give you a good historical contexts of the eras involved; and had many articles that add to the richness of the reader's understanding when studying th bible.I would highly recommend this work as an essential reference book in any student's library.
5,Great,Another great addition to my library. Use it all the time. I have another bibke dictionary but i use this one slightly more..
3,Handy Dolly Carti,"I have owned this cart for 5 years and have used it periodically around my horse barn. It is great for most things from moving hay, gardening or just moving the tools from the shop to the work site. The drawback is that you must disassemble the handle if you want to switch from cart to dolly. If it has a committed function as either a dolly or a cart no problem. If you need to go back and forth it is a pain. The handle brackets just broke because the little screws are the weakest link and have sheared off under an average work load."
4,Provides excellent viewpoints on the economics of baseball.,"This book eliminates the emotionality of the high priced players, and gets down to the basic economics of the game. It discussess all the issues that are relavant in today's game, such as revenue sharing, salary caps & collective bargaining."
5,An alternative title: Life's Little Instruction Book,"Some people say you have to be a woman to appreciate this book. Wrong. Some say it another ""Bridges"". Wrong. It's a book that explains family, marriage and relationships in a novel, amusing, heartfelt way that you've never seen before. Well...in a way that hasn't been explained before. We know the book is destined for greatness. But, the question we have to ask is, Ms. Wagman...what do we have to look forward to in the future"
2,Not a good value.,"The item was ""lost in the warehouse"" even though status report indicated that it had shipped, so it took three weeks to arrive. It's very cheaply made, I thought that $80 would buy a better product. I would put its value at about $25-30."
4,Perfect Healthy Meal on the Go!!!,I've been eating these Bear Valley Pemmican bars for years. They make a wonderful meal replacement! Great food on the go. Not too sweet like some of the energy bars out there. And all the ingredients are quite healthy. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a nice easy meal on the go. Good for almost any occasion. My personal favorite is the fruit and nut.
5,Made for Movie,"I was a huge Three Dog Night fan from the time they started to the end. This book is one of the best describing how rock stars live. I think it should be made into a movie it has it all, from comedy to horror. He told his story with humor at times. I couldn't put the book down, I finished it the day after I bought it. I applaud him for taking blame for his son being a junkie, if his wife had stopped taking drugs while pregnant the baby wouldn't of been a junkie, no matter how many times he shot up. Regardless of what a few here say, the man had a career within a career, his solos were the best of the three singers, and his harmonies with the other two were always on time, he had the right to brag, but I didn't see that he did. As for the egos he mentioned in the book, no band can have 3 front men and egos not flare. All in all it is a great book and it has a place on my bookshelf right along with my collection of Stephen King."
5,awesome!!!,"one of the very best books that I've read in many, many, many years!! Couldn't put it down, great read!"
5,FROM THE HEART,I have been involved in law enforcement for over 25 years. I even worked in undercover narcotics. No one has ever shared their life story in this fashion. This was the first time I have been able to hear the true story from someone who has been there with no strings attached. Mr. Negron doesn't pull any punches. If anyone ever wanted to know what heroin does to a person this is the book to read. I find myself using stories from this book in the Substance Abuse class I teach at a local college. Many thanks to Mr Blatchford and Mr Negron. All the best
5,Inspirational - A Must Read!,"I just finished the book at the end of June. I had a very difficult time putting this book down. I actually finished it in three days. I have always been a fan of Three Dog Night.It amazes me that Chuck is still with us after all that he has been through. It seems as if he was always dodging death (Wonderland, etc.), and somehow managed to get through. Amazing!The story is a first hand account of how destructive drugs can be. This book does not hold anything back. It is reflective, remorseful and even humorous at points.I think that anyone who is battling any type of addiction would find this book uplifting. I will definitely be sharing this book with two drug abusers who are in my life.I had the recent benefit of seeing Chuck in concert twice. He looks and sounds great. When you see him in person it is hard to believe that this man was a heavy drug user for so many years. What a triumphant comeback!"
4,Guilty pleasure...,"Chuck Negron's memoir ""Three Dog Nightmare"" has the feel of an AA guest speaker recounting his downward spiral. As many speakers in AA tend to do, Negron dwells quite a bit on the most sordid aspects of his life as well as bragging quite a bit about his accomplishments & the depth of his addiction.However, aided by co-author Chris Blatchford, Negron offers many valuable reminisences about the music biz of the 1960's/70's as well as being quite brutally honest about himself. This book would be a good read not only for fans of Three Dog Night, but also for people who are close to an addict, to better understand the mind set and the power of addiction."
4,"Drugs, sex, and rock 'n' roll, but still a good read","The book takes us from Chuck's beginnings as an insecure kid who played hookie from school to spend the day at home alone rather than face class, through his basketball years, to his life as the guy we all knew (or thought we knew). Everything from an exploding penis from too much groupie poking, to the nightmarish world of total heroin addiction (which lasted a full 20 years), I found his story quite readable, and rarely boring. I don't think I skipped over a word in the book. As has been said before, it is an absolute wonder that the man still breathes."
2,It's only a book,"Having been through the nightmare of addiction and working a 12-step program myself, I'm almost offended by Mr. Negron's story. It's not the story, it's the blaming, the finger-pointing, the refusal to do what ""the program"" teaches us to -- take responsibility for our actions. I'm so disgusted that now, I skip over Chuck's songs.Good for you, Chuck, for staying clean all these years. Shame on you, too, for taking others' inventories so publicly and putting personalities way before principles."
1,I'm afraid it put me to sleep....twice!,"I've read it, but it was a struggle. Everything that has happened to this man was somebody else's fault....his mother, his father, women, Three Dog Night! My father always told me that the road to hell is paved with excuses and Chuck Negron is the ""king"" of excuses. If everything was as great and wonderful as we're being told, there wouldn't be any need to trash former bandmates and friends."

G R E A T.This book is very very expensive on AMAZON--I checked it out of thelibrary.I LOVED THEM!bbp okc ok 63retired.
5,Pulls no Punches,"""Three Dog Nightmare"" is one of the most compelling rock biographies ever written.Chuck Negron unflinchingly gives the details of his 20 year addiction to heroin.The book is almost brutally honest.He definately doesn't spare himself as we see how he went from rock and roll millionaire to penniless junkie.I'll never be able to hear Three Dog Night songs in the same way again.A real page turner!"
4,"Works Good, BUT!","Works very well. You need a big case and on ASUS boards, it crowds the memory module slots. It still fits, but it could be a problem on some boards."
2,Fan is problematic,"I got one of these in 2007. It worked fine for a couple years but then the fan started to get noisy and slow. Eventually I got CPU fan failure alerts from the mobo. Thermaltake nicely rma'd and replaced the fan for me, but after only one year, the replacement fan started to get noisy too.I should add that the noise from this unit will be the loudest thing in your case if you are used to 120mm case fans.I've since replaced my cpu cooler with a zalman that has a 120mm fan and it is MUCH quieter even than a new mini-typhoon."
2,Below par,"This may have been a good PC game, but it's a shoddy port.The controller setup gives you a choice of 4 predefined configs with no option to change button assignments, I find this unforgivable. To add insult there's no support for southpaws making the game a waste of hard earned cash from the start for me.The gfx are quake style - chunky and with no lighting effects. The locations are varied but in some places quite messy. These gfx would have been quite something 3 or 4 years ago but now they look dated, Goldeneye looked better.Gameplay is not so bad - given a good controller layout it would be much better. Frequent 30sec loading interludes do not do much for the pace though.On the good side the dialogue is laugh out loud funny in places and the plot quite original - it's a pity to see some basic mistakes ruin the work of the original PC programming team.Aviod - get Red Faction if you want a PS2 FPS... but if you really want the best then get Halo ;)"
4,Forever Man,"NLfE is a great game.You play as a bad### chick and it is so cool because there are different bullets such as dum-dums thatif you shoot a car it will explode. The tutorial is great,acceptthat the doors in the corridor a alike,so its sometime hard tofind the right door.Buy it!!!!!!"
1,Threw down controller before completing the first level,"This is not a game that should have been released for a next generation console. Goldeneye on the N64 looked as good as this, and was about a billion times more playable. My girlfriend was shocked to hear such explosive foul language erupt from my mouth when the first level loaded. Switching weapons is tedious, and the analog controls aren't really analog (to sneak you must crouch and push up, up, up, up --- you can't just push lightly on the analog stick). Perhaps later in the game there would have been some interesting gameplay and strategy, but there's no way would I have had the patience to find out."
2,This game is crap,This game is not all that great. Graphics are choppy and load times are long. I say no one lives forever is crap.
2,Substandard gaming...,"This Bond-wannabe game goes through the motions of a standard action game, but leaves nothing out of the ordinary. The graphics are dated, the story is used and the gameplay just isn't all that interesting. This is a dud in the action gaming world. Don't spend your money on this one."
1,Pure Garbage,"Like everyone else is saying, this is absolute garbage and the company is trying to scam you by posting bogus 5-star reviews on Amazon. All products by Transparent Language are basically a 10-page piece of text spoken aloud by a native speaker. To lay the foundations of your language learning they use short, useless help files (a one-page list of the letters of the alphabet and a very sparse introduction to the different parts of speech) and nothing else. What they're selling individually for $90 was originally all bundled together for $10 on the ""101 Languages of the World"" CD, but as you can imagine they're making quite the killing doing things this way. There are a few reviewers who seem to actually -believe- the product deserves 5 stars but I seriously doubt they've ever used any other language software in their life. I'm convinced you'd learn more Spanish from Dora the Explorer's Happytime Funland."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"What a waste of 90 dollars! No set order, everything is completely jumbled around. There's some software and a book, and the book makes absolutely no sense with the software. Do yourself a favor- go to Best Buy and get a computer Spanish course for 20 bucks, and it'll be better."
2,Not much new information,"This is a good book for someone who has little or no understanding of basic nutrition. I don't think it provides any new information for someone who already knows the basics of sports nutrition, and I would have liked more detail."
3,Food Guide For Marathoners,"I found this book to be fine as just a food guide, but I got more out of John Hanc's Marathon book, which had a chapter or two on fueling for running. Much of what is in this book is either common knowledge or self-evident. In my opinion, you will get more out of a book on running marathons or any running magazine."
4,Fun album from Nuevo Mexico bros....,"I didn't have ""Nuevo Latino,"" only their second album. It's fun to hear their earlier music."
3,this was expensive i think,but it worked...just how much do you have to spend to dry your car...my husband ordered this he was sa
3,Monster Jam Maximum Destruction,Pretty Fun game overall. Not as good as Urban Assault. I thought you would be able to have weapons on command. You have to gain them and they only are temporary
1,What were they thinking?,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played. The control is pathetic. There is no point to the game. Loading time is good, but I would rather not play the game at all."
1,Poorly engineered - keep looking for another case,"I bought this case for an m505 twice. I bought it from a national electronics retailer, and that case kept the Palm on and drained the battery, wiping out all the data on the Palm. I called the Palm Support 1-800 line, and the rep I spoke with claimed that this was the first time she'd heard of the problem. She recommended I return it and try again. I also read on the Palm support forum that Palm had redesigned the case, and the newer cases didn't drain the battery. WRONG. After purchasing it again from Amazon.com, we had the same problem. Back it went. I'm currently looking for a different brand case. Recommendation: stay away from this case."
1,Nice looks but does not work at all!,"This beautiful case is certainly very elegant. However, it simply is not functional! When I try to close the cover (with the Palm turned off, of course), the case simply turns the palm on. And when I need to use the Palm, it is ALWAYS out of battery.Do not buy it."
2,Design Flaw?,"I purchased this case because I thought it would provide better screen protection than a soft case. Unfortunately, it drained my battery because everytime I closed it, it would press against the power button and keep the unit on. This problem is with the m515 model. If it werent for this, the case would get much higher ratings."
1,Don't buy this case,"I also am experiencing the battery drain problem with my m515 and am now in the market for another case. There's no way to close the case without turning it on. Some people seem to not have this problem, but why risk it."
2,several problems,"I first bought the case for my m505. Stylus fell out at approx 3 months, breaking. I've now gone thru 3 styli. Case stopped latching closed at about 4 months. I also had the problem with the case activating the palm, but shaved the inside with a scalpel solving the problem. Poorly designed. You'd think they'd try it out before they sold it."
2,Good for about 4-5 months,"I had no problem with this case up until now (4-5 monts after the purchase date). The plastic wore out and now I cant keep this case closed. It does close but opens at the slightest disturbance. Given the price of this unit, the closing mechanism could have been designed a bit better."
2,Fine ... For 5 months,The hard case is nice (but heavy) and I had no problems for 6 months. Then for seemingly no reason the latch on the case now will not closed.I never had a problem with the case turning the palm on and draining the battery. The stylus never falls out. I just can close it now. Pretty annoying given the cost. Of course I don't have the packaging (who would keep it for 6 months?) so I can't return it anywhere. Bummer.
1,Nice style-but the powering on is a big problem!,"The case is nice, but the powering on the Palm is a major problem! I loved the way the case looked and did not find opening it very difficult. However, no matter how careful I was on closing the case shut, it would power the Palm on! A major flaw. Just taking the closed case out of my briefcase with the slight squeeze to pull it out-- turned it on. I think using the supplied stylus probably helped from closing it incorrectly so as not to squeeze too hard, but only if you carefully closed the case and not squeeze near the power button. For the 2 days I had tried to use it, I spent so much time trying to make sure it closed correctly without turning my Palm on. I took it back and got my money back. If they only fix this problem then I might consider it again. I ended up getting the Franklin Covey leather covered metal hardcase. It may not snap/lock shut, but it provides sturdy protection you would expect from a hardcase."
2,Tough but flawed,"I bought this case to protect my 515. The 515 is fine after a few falls, but the case is not. The clasp broke after one month of use. There is also no place to store extra chips, which is annoying."
1,also diappointed,"while it is a nice case, the power on problem is a major flaw with this case. No matter how careful I was, it turned on my Palm M505. I did not have a problem with the opening it and the fact it folds back is very nice. I think the supplied stylus helps one close the case correctly, but I still had to be extra careful not to close or squeeze near the power button. If you do that you are sure to turn it on. However, just closing it shut without much pressure also turned it on as well as when I took it out of my briefcase. Too much trouble so I took it back and got my money back. If they fix this flaw then I would consider it again."
5,Baby Alive must have,This is a great addition to Baby Alive mainly because of the pacifier. The pacifier is what makes her go to sleep. So I guess for some parents this is a must have for their childs Baby Alive .
5,Very Happy with Amazon,I did purchase my daughter's baby alive from amazon. com. It was not expensive and I even got a deal with the accesory pack. It arrived on time and in great condition. I am very impressed with Amazon's promptness and efficency.
3,I didn't need this book.,I like to keep the design of my candles in the candle. gluing anything to the outside or loose chunks of gel are not highly desired in our living rooms.
5,Sega Football NFL '98 review,"This is a really fun game. Most Sega Football games are good but this is the newest version and the last one they released for the Sega Genesis system. I like it so much I have to order another one through Amazon becuase the one I bought originally is glitched and it is hard to find this game used or new. I highly recommend this game for football lovers. It has excellent graphics you can create up to 26 additional players and the view you get on screen while playing is very user friendly. There are more plays and each team has it's own playbook, or you can choose all plays option and it lets you choose all plays from all teams during game play. You can play up to four players with an adaptor and it has the newest NFL teams. I believe it is even better than some of the new high tech football games that are coming out now."
1,Straps came out!,"I bought this for my daughter for Pre-K, mostly because I could get it in her favorite color: Purple. She loved it, and we started using it every day as a diaper bag as well. After a few months the straps were unraveling from the main bag where it connects up top, by the neck. Bad quality. Waste of money."
3,small and cute,"I ordered the red backpack, my favorite color. It is more like a big purse but it does fit a standard, school-sized folder inside if using for kids."
3,Not very impressive to me........,This product although is cheaper and looking very fancy but in reality the color and the quality of the material is not so impressive.I bought this item for my preschool going daughter but the shape is not suitable for her. It may be useful for other purposes.
2,Too Small,I thought I was getting a full sized backpack for my kid to use at school. When I got it in the mail it was too small.
5,Nice intermediate size,Bought these for our girl scout troop (2nd grade) so each girl could have a bag for her GS outings. We got one for the adults too. It is a nice size bag for a day outing - water bottle holder and a couple of pockets. Fits adults or kids comfortably.
1,The Great Perpetration!,"Though all of these musicians are incredible in their own light, I find their renditions of some of the most incredible and well-known works of ""The Duke,"" a disaster. Some things are better left alone. The originality of each of these pieces are no where to be found on this project. Many of the players sound if someone gave them a project that they knew nothing about, and they simply threw something together - with no real effort whatsoever. If we are to give hommage to our forefathers in this great genre of music, we should do them justice. It reminds me of Janet Jackson trying to do Ella Fitzgerald or worse, Mary J. Blige trying to do Chaka Khan. NOT! This should be a crime! Let's keep the new smooth Jazz funkateers in this epoch and leave ther masters back in days of old!"
3,Good but Limited,"The guide only covers two states in center of mexico. I was dissapointed that it didn't cover Nayarit or Sinaloa state as I was planning to surf San Blas area. However, the guide is very good for the area it does cover."
2,sometimes yummy macadamia nuts,"These macadamia nuts were wonderful. The best I have ever tasted. Firm, sweet and salty, I was surprised that they were WHOLE. Almost every nut was perfect.ALERT...The second order from this company was as bad as the first was wonderful. They were small, many were not whole and sll were overcooked, some not good at all. Shame on your quality control...I have another order on the way and I do hope they are not as bad as my latest"
3,it's ok,I would rate this a 2 1/2. It looks good but the fur and the tweed is very itchy and not soft. A little stiff even. I'm hoping it wont fall apart when washed because the material is also very thin. Maybe a little fabric softener will help.
3,"Hat as described, but kind of cheap looking","I bought this hat based on the other reviews, but I don't think how thin the materials are comes through in the pictures or the other reviews. I guess it's not that expensive, so you get what you pay for... but somehow I was expecting a more luxurious feeling hat. The tweed looks cool- just not much to it."
4,jojo rules,Listening to Jonathan Richman on CD is best served after seeing him live. That way when you close your eyes and listen to the music you can visualize him on stage with his unique persona shining through every song.
4,22nd album,"Jonathan Richman is a legend. He has released a million albums and songs. Well, maybe not that many. This is actually his 22nd album in about thirty years. It's eleven more songs. Another chapter in the book. He was pretty obscure during most of his life. Members of the Modern Lovers went on to be in The Cars and the Talking Heads. Some notice came his way when the Sex Pistols covered his songs. Years later a whole new generation would watch him on Sesame Street and in the film ""There's Something About Mary."" Richman has a few songs about love, but also songs about Vincent Van Gogh and Salvador Dali. It's funny stuff."
3,"Dekor and Dekor Plus, not the same...","There are two identical looking Diaper Dekor products. Unless you know in advance, for certain, which one you have buy your first refills at a store where you can check. The Dekor plus is a larger size decor, and is identical right down to only saying ""Dekor"" on the front. The height of these is just a bit different, but the width of the Decor is about ten inches while the Dekor Plus is about fourteen. Also, the Diaper Dekor has a round diaper opening, while the Dekor Plus has a square diaper opening.If only they would say ""Dekor Plus"" on the Dekor Plus."
4,Diaper Dekor can has drawbacks but refill is grand,"The Dekor can WILL smell unless you put arm and hammer in there after poo poos. Also, the way you open the lid is NOT at all convenient for throwing away poo laden tissue/ diapers AS YOU WIPE, unless you want smears on the double doors. I usually just lift up the entire lid and balance it open with one finger while dropping in the soiled cloths. Not very easy to do but it works. The refill bag itself though is quite easy to install and very convenient. One plus is the the can doubles as a regular waste can even after baby is older. I just wish the lid had a way to open with your foot that INCLUDED swinging open the inner double doors."
4,Diaper Dekor rocks!,"This system has worked really well for us. Minimal odor, and it can be used after we are done with diapers. The refill is easy to replace (there are 3 refills per box). The downside of this system is at the end (when the liner is running out), there is nothing holding the liner up, so if you don't realize you are almost out, the bag falls down (thus it gets a 4 star rating). Other than that, everything works great!"
4,Great system but refills hard to find!,"I love my diaper dekor. This is SOOO much better than the genie. This is easily our favorite diaper pail and after seeing 8 nieces and nephews go through the diaper stage, this is the Cadillac of diaper pails. I'm disappointed that our local Target no longer sells them or the refills. I have to buy the refills on line now, so keep that in mind if you order this system. You may be in the same boat."
1,STINKY SYSTEM!,"I purchased this diaper system on referral from all of the excellent comments I saw here on this website. It was ok for the first 4 months or so, but after that, the as they say ""stench was maddening"". I purchased scent discs, they didn't work, I spray Lysol each time I empty the bag (every 3 days or so) and I have tried to air it outside opened up - nothing works. Luckily my Diaper Dekor is contained in a door in my changing table, so it only smells when I put a diaper in, or when I'm changing it."
5,Much better than Diaper Genie,"This is the easiest system to use. I could never understand the genie system, and had three children in diapers. This is easy and modestly priced, although finding the refills in local stores is not that easy."
2,Great for 6 months- then comes the smell,"We registered for this item based on reviews/suggestions. It was great for about 6 months- then it started to smell horrible. I have twin 14 mo olds, and change the bag often. I even contacted the company, they sent me another, and it too smelled after a month or so. Once you put a soiled diaper in it- it reaks!! Also, my kids have figured out how to put toys in it- needs to be somehwhat kid proof."
1,These don't fit! Something's wrong,"The packaging looks different, even though the words all say the right things. The logo looks right, but when you get them out and try to install, the diameter of the bags is smaller than the diameter of the insert sleeve they go on.FRUSTRATING! I of course didn't know this until I had to use the new box! Now stuck, bags don't fit, no other option on Amazon, and an open package I can't return. Very disappointed."
1,STINKY SITUATION!!!,"We went with the Diaper Dekor Plus because of good reviews and because it looked like a decent product when we were checking all of the diaper disposal systems out.And I'm sure it is a fine product...BUT...there is one slight problem. YOU CAN'T BUY THE REFILLS ANYWHERE!!! We are now three weeks out from our due date and still no refills!I'd take it back, but I tossed the box out right after our Baby Shower. You wouldn't think a diaper garbage would be one of the possible returns. THINK AGAIN! I'm going to force Babies-R-Us into taking this back and at least giving us store credit, because this is ridiculous."
3,Best MLB game for the 16 bit platform,"Yes, The rosters are outdated by nearly 10 yeras nowYes, The expansion Diamondbacks and Devil Rays are absent from season playYes, it looks and plays no different from earlier versionsBut if you want to relive the old days of 16 bit baseball supremicy this is the title to own. I recently dusted off my old Sega Nomad and found myself addicted to this game just like I was almost a decade ago.If you're into camera angles ( Which I am ) and true player animations ( Which I am ) but want to experience a baseball game that was the king of all MLB games while video games were still in their 2-D innocence, then look no further."
4,Great buy for my daughter!!,"I purchased this video for my 1 year old daughter who loves the Bratz Moves. She watches them all the time and it keeps her interest. I would say buy these videos if your daughters like the Bratz, you would be sorry at all."
5,A beautiful book...,"I love Lois Ehlert's books, and this is hands-down my favorite. It's a charming story of the inspirations that surround us every day, the kind that can be lost if we don't pay attention to them. I've given away several copies to parents and childless friends who cooed over my copy."
3,Ok but may be better choices,"After reading the reviews, I bought this one instead of a George Forman. I cooked 4 hamburgers on it with the lid down and they quickly overcooked. Also, it was more to cleanup than I anticipated."
5,I love this grill!!,"If you have ever had to try to clean a George Foreman grill in your sink, this is the grill for you. I love this grill. It is so easy to use. I can place 3 frozen hamburgers on it and voila! in 6 minutes I have 3 fully cooked, juicy hamburgers. Then, for clean up I just remove the plates and clean up is a breeze. I have used this grill also with chicken strips, paninni sandwiches, french toast and my husband's favorite Monte Cristo Sandwiches. I am so glad I invested in this grill."
4,Easy to use and clean,"I am really happy with this grill. I have used it for all kinds of meals. We've made grilled sandwiches, hot dogs, chicken breasts, and burgers on it. I like the fact that the grease tray sets into the grill, so it won't spill easily. I also like the fact that it cooks so quickly. If I'm cooking for a larger group, I can move a batch of food to a plate and cook the next batch before the first batch gets cold. I have been using a dish brush to remove any larger pieces that may be stuck to the plates (there usually isn't much), and then loading the plates into the dishwasher. It washes up great!"
1,Girls are equal too was totally outdated...,"I read the book ""Girls are Equal Too"" and although I found it very informational as to the history of women being treated unfairly, the information relating to now was totally, completely, absolutely outdated- at least where I live. I attribute this fact to the original copywright- 1973, was it? In 27 years women have come a long way. One thing that bugged me especially: The author says that boys ask for dates, pay for dates. I say that girls now ask for dates, and go dutch and pay their own share, usually.If you would care to debate, email me."
5,A Great Informative Book,"This is an awesome book. The author provides a detailed overview of controversial issues. I was engrossed in the book for hours. My husband felt totally neglected. I would recommed this book to anyone who has concerns about historical issues. Mr. Gardner provides the reader with the most ancient names of God, history about Moses, the power of gold, and the holy grail."
1,Oh Dear,"There seem to be only 2 possible views of this book, one is that the author is having a joke at the expense of his readership, the second is that he is deliberately junking his own reputation and so that of all his books and their contents.References are mostly either to ""Jesus the Man"" or his own books, which in turn reference ""Jesus the Man"" or his own books.The central theme is based on a well-known Internet ""scam"" (monatomic gold) and the conclusion is, well, jolly interesting....But why did he write it? I would recommend this book for people who are heavily sedated."
5,This book opens the past for us...,...and brings it right to our time. I am working with Monatomic Elements to make the DNA a superconductor for higher consciousness coming to us in the next years and this book reveales the history behind. Great! Thank you Laurence for this contribution to our history.
3,It was okay.,The back was cracked but I didn't pay much for it. Still I suppose I can still read it. TY
3,"Some good parts, but too many parts","I'm not a fan of the author. He smells too much like a guy who rushes to publish fringe ideas with the hopes of making some money and to claim the ideas as his own as soon as possible. Much of this book ranges from interesting to downright silly. The only thing I find interesting is the strange gold powder that--like other reviewers pointed out--deserves some genuine investigation by more people. Although the author has brought more attention to the powder, it was not his discovery. My problem is that he splatters his name on it too much, giving the impression he is trying too hard to make it his very own discovery.This monoatomic gold is a fascinating subject. We need more people with genuine credentials and integrity to really study this stuff. Do a web search on this stuff and you find quacks with snake oil. It's unfortunate that something with some legitimate potential has been fouled by false prophets and greedy peddlers."
3,entertaining,"It seems Gardner tries to hold up a scientific pretense which he decidedly does not fulfill. Other than that its well written - in the fiction category I would give it 4 stars. The issue discussed, white powder gold or Ormus, deserves a real scientific reflection. But not from this author."
4,Good Toy but weak poles!,My son loves this tent however I was a bit disappointed that the pole bent just by moving it a little and the shape of it has been lost; Otherwise good toy!
4,Doggie dome.,"Bought the tent for our boys, 2 and 10 months. Our greyhounds use it as their spot and won't let the kids in. We should have bought 2."
1,Shoddy-broke in 1st half hour,"Nothing worse than a toy that breaks on Christmas morning. This year for us, this product wins the prize for the toy that breaks first--and in record setting time. The zipper is so flimsy that it will inevitably break. After two zips, it broke. The metal clasp on the zipper is wafer-thin.I can't tell if the rest of it is this shoddy, and won't wait to find out. It's going back to Amazon for a full refund."
5,As Tents Go...,"My kids got this tent as a gift. First time you see the package you think something is wrong, it's not what you ordered. But the surprise comes when you opened it and do the assembly. It is a big tent for INSIDE camping. The top is a mesh material (not good for outside in case it rains), easy to assemble, durable well thought. My kids are 5 and 6, been using it for a month and a half and so far no breakage or tears."
3,"Big tent, poor quality.","My daughter thoroughly enjoys this inside, play tent; however, I was extremely disappointed by the poor quality. The tent is easy to assemble and quite roomy but the zipper broke within the first hour of play. The zipper was extremely cheap! I would not recommend this product. Spend a little more and invest in an actual tent that's more durable."
4,Great purchase,"I bought this for my grandson because he always wants to have a ""fort"" to play in and thought this would be easier than making one from bedsheets draped over furniture. I am so pleased with the decision to buy this tent, as is my grandson. It is a great size, room for 2-3 persons plus room to spare for toys, etc. The tent assembles very quickly and easily and it comes down just as easily. Takes up little space when stored. The see through netting on the upper section of the tent is such a nice feature - it allows for air circulation that prevents over heating as with other tents."
4,Plenty of play room,This tent has plenty of room for my 2 and 4 year old to play and bring lots of toys in with them. Great value.
2,Disappointed with Quality,"The seller shipped promptly but the merchandise disappointed ... materials/workmanship not so hot; my husband stuck his hand all the way through a side panel while setting it up. Since there was no taking it back from our 2-year-old after he saw it, he now has a tent with an extra window in it. Child is delighted with the toy, parent is not delighted with durability."
5,Great item!,"I bought this generous sized, well-made tent for my grandchildren, along with a tunnel, to play in, in their yard. They just love it and, have spent countless hours playing in it ... I highly recommend this item to all!"
4,"great tent,","Grandbabys had a great time with this tent. Played with it all day long, then they slept in it that night and both had plenty of room"
2,Material,I would like to have known that I was buying plastic. I don't expect it to stand up to my five year old grandson.
5,Solid,"If you have a child that is rough and tumble, this is perfect. Corners are flexible and assembly is easy. I'm not sure how much of an outdoor tent this is as we primarily use it indoors."
5,Such a fun gift,My grandson received this as a Christmas gift and it was easy to set up . Arrived quickly and as described. His favorite toy! Would buy from this seller again.
5,This is a great tent for children.,This product is sturdier than I expected and fits my three grandsons without crowding. We love that it has more than one opening.
3,Big for a kid,"this was larger than i had expected.my 2yr old grand daughter loves it.but she likes to run into the sides.i would like it better if it has some sort of floor panel, to lend it some more stability"
5,"Huge, durable & fun","I would highly suggest having the room for this tent as it is huge! I didn't realize it would be so big but I wanted something that would fit my 3 kids and their friends or family that came over to play. My kids have had fun with this tent nonstop since we've put it up, its went from being a fort to becoming a place to sleep at night. I love the idea of having the extra windows on the side to add the tunnels later on if we wish (we need a bigger house for that though)."
5,Awesome tent!,I purchased this as a gift for kids who have EVERYTHING and are so hard to shop for (nanny kids)....and they loved it! It appears to be very well made. It's a good sized tent and they have already spent many hours playing in it. We can't wait to purchase a tunnel to go with the tent as well as a second tent for their birthdays.
3,A gift,"Bought this for my grandson. It's quite roomy inside and he loves it, but the corners are letting go at the bottom after only a couple of months of play. It isn't up all the time, so that's disappointing cause I wonder if it would be any good at all now. For something that little ones are gonna run in and out of (and that's really the purpose for them) it could be made a little sturdier at the bottom where the tent poles rest."
2,Not that durable,"If you kids are like mine and like to jump around and sometimes roll the tent, then this is not much of a value. Ours lasted few hours before i have to tape it."
5,Great value! My kids love it!,"This IS a large tent....bigger than I expected. I was looking for something my kids could use as a fort or play house. Like the other reviewer stated, you do need to have a large area indoors for this tent. It was easy to put together and I like that I can add on to it in the future.The $30-$35 price tag for this tent is a great bargain. I also think more than 4 children could fit inside (toddler/preschool age for sure)."
2,it's ok,there just wasn't much of a story line... it was all over before it go started and you're like that's it?... it was funny and good quick read but definitely not her best
1,Horrible,"Dont bother, this series (Hello Gorgeous & Drop Dead Gorgeous) SUCKS! Not anywhere near the quality of the ""Betsy the Vampire Queen"" series."
1,"silly, silly, silly","I usually like her books but I really hated this one. It was so silly and the story and characters were not believable. come on! a 23 year old hair salon receptionist that is an expert marksman, blackbelt in karate and has her masters in psychology. For real??? spies that have robots in their blood! give me a break. couldn't finish this one."
2,freaking awful,"It's becoming painfully obvious that the author is just cranking out new books, probably to fulfill contract obligations so she can buy the designer shoes her characters often love. CHECK IT OUT FROM THE LIBRARY BEFORE PURCHASING! The main characters have little or no depth and they just really aren't likeable. The storyline doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's a huge departure from her writing style in the Undead series (when it was still good, ie. the first 2 books). She's either getting complacent and or writer's block."
3,"Prefer Betsy, but pretty funny","Another humorous novel from Davidson, this is the follow-up to HELLO, GORGEOUS! where Stacy and The Boss are getting married. When there is an assassination attempt, things almost fall apart, but the ceremony is finished and Jenny Branch, bridesmaid and receptionist at the hair salon where Stacy works, captures the gunman, to everyone's surprise. The Boss begins to realize that there is much more to Jenny than anyone imagines, and sends her undercover with the gunman, Kevin Stone, to infiltrate the Snakepit, where Kevin had been working undercover for years. Things don't go as planned, but Jenny and Kevin manage their escape to solve the mystery of the assassination attempt. Definitely need to read the first in the series to understand this novel, and while this is a fun read, the superficiality is overwhelming at times."
3,Disappointed....,"I was very disappointed with ""Drop Dead, Gorgeous."" I gave ""Hello, Gorgeous"" 5 stars because I thought it was a fun, entertaining read. In spite of the low rating others gave it, I thought it was quite innovative and very entertaining.This sequel didn't even come close to the original ""gorgeous"" story. It wasn't fun or exciting. In fact, I couldn't even tell you the plot after reading it. It was very unmemorable and didn't even come close to innovative.Read ""Hello"" and stop there. ""Drop Dead"" isn't worth your time or money."
2,Last one for me,"I was an instant fan of MJD, however this series is not among her best. Not even mediocre. I read Hello Georgeous, and wasn't thrilled with it. I read this one hoping for a better story, I hoped in vain. I will not read another in this series. The charaters are undeveloped and the stories are just lame. I am truley disappointed. It seems the author is just too busy churning out the books that no real thought or effort is put into telling the story well. I hope this is not a continuing trend in her writing. That would be tragic."
5,Scary!!,"This game scared even me (a horror movie enthusiast). The changing camera angle that affects your view of what is in front of you, to the whispering voices in the background, to the even scarier appearances of spirits out of the corner of your eye, make this game a top choice for anyone looking for something a little out of the ordinary. GREAT GAME!!"
4,frame it,"Fatal Frame is absolutely great- it's probably just as good, maybe even better, than the Silent Hill series. It's about TOTAL fear, just like the Silent Hill series. The amount of fear and the atmosphere you constantly feel will really amaze you. I dare you to play this game in the dark. You won't be able to do it. The gameplay is really fun too. This is one atmospheric adventure that will absorb into your memories forever. It's not as good as the original Playstation One Silent Hill game however, but good enough for me to recommend a purchase."
3,"Fatal Frame 1,2, and 3 on PS2","Hi everyone;Please excuse my improper typing,typo errors,sentences running long,etc....I just bought:Fatal Frame 1,2 and 3 on PS 2 game discs.I have played similiar games such as:Haunting Ground and Rule of Rose...I just started the 1st game in this series:Fatal frame,so far evrything is going great.No freezing,no glitches,as of yet.I will be back with a fuller,better review when I am finished this game.From what I seen written,pretty much matches,on describing this game! Another spooky,adventure game.see ya's soon!"
5,Don't turn off the lights,"This is by far the scariest game I'd ever played...and I've played many games of this genre. Once I played it late at night and believe me I had to stop...too much for me. Highly recommend, It really worth the bucks"
2,no horror here,for some reason i just didn't feel the suspense this game was trying to convey - the sound and graphics are great - the story line is pretty interesting also - it just couldn't hook me - maybe it's the fact that a camera is your weapon - so you have to go to a static first person perspective to fight - and switch back and forth to evade and attack -- i would definitely rent this one first -
2,"Overall, an awful game","I am a huge fan of survival horror games and this game is just bad. The graphics are quite good and the level designs are very atmospheric but the positive elements stop right there. The gameplay is awful. The character is very slow and your only weapon is a camera, which is not a ""unique twist"", it is an idiotic idea. It is beyond me how so many people are calling this the scariest game ever. I did not find this game to be even remotely scary. The ghosts are nothing more than annoying. Also, there are way too many of them. I could not finish the game because I ran out of film from being attacked by the same ghost, spouting the same cliched B Movie dialogue every five minutes, which is fine because I was seriously considering just not playing anymore anyway."
2,"It's Frightening!! How Bad This Game Is, that is...","Ok, let me start by saying that this game looks good. The ghosts and the mansion look very creepy. Reminding me of Silent Hill 2 (which I liked). They definetly achieve making you a little jumpy and just pretty much designing a scary atmosphere. So kudos to them for that. (Hence my 2 stars)The gameplay however is terrible. The character's movement is slow and annoying. And her weapon...an antique camera!! Who is the genius that came up with this one. Not only is it a bad idea but they don't even pull it off. Making it very hard to fight ghosts and needlessly tedious.Overall, I give this game 2 stars for the graphics and for the spooky environment. But the gameplay and overall game get zip. If you're really that interested in the idea of this game, then rent it. Don't buy it or you will regret it."
4,Might actually be better than Resident Evil,"I've got so many survival horror games that I don't know what to do with them, but this game stands head and shoulders above the rest.The atmosphere of the game is really something, and the graphics are truly excellent to boot.The puzzles are the best since the resident evil series and the difficulty level is absolutely perfect.Great stuff!"
5,Fatal Frame,This is a very good game. Its exciting and very well done for what it is.Keeps one on their toes and anxious.Good game
4,Fatal frame review,"If you like scary games, then you are going to love the fatal frame series. With erie sounds and vengful ghosts hiding in every cooridor, this game is sure to keep you on your feet, and screaming for more. In the game you are looking for your recently disappeared brother, and when you find only an antique camera left behind by your late mother, many questions lay waiting to be answered. The fear in the game is amplified due to the battle system FORCING you to get face to face with chilling specters and horrifying tourtured souls. And with the ability to upgrade your camera, this game adds an extra insentive to take the best shots possibly of your ghostly rivals. Overall i give this game a 4/5"
2,hard to learn,"i already learn french in school. And if i dind't already know a little bit then i would have a huge problem with learning from this from scratch. It's difficult to use. It doesn't teach you vocabulary. And i've found errors in the some of the translations. Overall I dont find this product useful, and it's totally not worth the money"
1,complete disappointment,"This product is a complete waist of money. It doesn't teach you step by step, all the material is translated into english."
5,very worth reading for programer!,"If you are going to program with registry, this one is your must have. There are in-depth explanations of backing up, restoring and accessing to the registry, plenty of examples in the book. The author also address the registry(key)difference between WindowsNT and Windows95, though not very thorough. Except some functions are ""obsolete"" (i.e. getwinflags()) and all of them are used ""old fashioned"" c, the codes in those examples are well tested. More over, there are two charpters are dedicated to ""VB"" programers and whenever possible, the author tries to show the example in both ""C"" and ""VB"". I would like to see the second version of this book explaining more about WindowsNT registry and using MFC."
4,Definitely worth the purchase price,"This was the first ""registry"" book that I bought and I measure all of the others by it. If you are a programmer, this is *the bible* of registry programming as far as I am concerned. My only disappointment was the lack of a ""reference"" to most common registry entries. There are a number to be found, but they are scattered through-out the book and there aren't enough."
2,Not Quite a reference...,This book is terribly outdated... Anyone wanting to buy this now is out of their mind...! *s*
4,"Delicious, but not any different taste-wise than Trader Joe's","We always get peanut butter that is nothing but peanut butter (no hydrogenated oils, sugars, and other junk). We ordered this peanut butter after hearing about all of the peanut butter contamination recalls, but also because we read about fungus that tends to grow on peanuts. Since we eat it almost daily, we had read a review that this one tends to not have the fungus, but we really don't know if that's true. We spent more on this and it tasted exactly the same as the more economical Trader Joe's Peanut butter, so we'll just go back to Trader Joe's. This Maranatha peanut butter is WAY too expensive to order by mail, especally after you add shipping costs."
4,Very good for the price,I've had these speakers for about a year now. I personally like the mid and low range they have but the highs n are not as crispt as I would like it to be. They look great though. I had to purchase a sub to make the real low notes rumble through. I paid about half of their retail price and I'm very happy about that. Therefore I would recommend these VR3 for anyone that can still find a set.
5,This Is A Great CD!,I'VE SEEN THESE GUYS PERFORM AT CBGB'S IN NEW YORK. THESE GUYS REALLY KNOW HOW TO PLAY. GO FREELOADER!
4,Finally,"I was searching Amazon, looking for that album that might remind me of Country Honk by Mick and the boys, music that no longer exists in the days of the Backstreet Boys. I did not find it, but I am thrilled with what I did find. I am not a critic, I buy a CD and either am into them or discard them quickly. This album fits into the former.....honest music that makes you hit repeat again and again... a bit rough, not from the Juliard school, but something pure that hits you. Look out for these guys, they are on their way to big big things. I just hope they stay true when the labels come calling. Few do."
3,Rayman,It's a little tough to get a hang of the controls and even then it's kinda hard to move around on some of the screens.
3,Not My Favorite Game,"This game has good graphics, but compared with other games such as Pikmin easily falls short."
1,THIS GAME STINKS,This game has not been released yet but I played a demo of it. If you want a good game get SSX tricky. Here is my rating of this game.Sound 5/5Replay Value 1/5Graphics 5/5Fun 1/5This game really stinks...
4,good genesis football,"Basically, this is good Genesis football. I wish they would improve the graphics, but then again, this is Genesis. PRIME TIME NFL is not quite up to the standards set by the competition, but is good quality. It is not the best (see MADDEN NFL 2002 on X-BOX), but is not the worst (see NFL QUARTERBACK CLUB on the APPLE 2 HOME COMPUETER). I would recommend this title for anone who wants a break from MADDEN '94, but also wants a good game."
5,Red Rose,This book is a very enjoyable read. Excellent dialog and the plot lines are complex eonough without becoming convoluted. Great summer entertainment.
1,Jmbhouse,"I would not recommend this pan. It's too light weight and flimsy. Even if it was a dollar, I would not buy it. Replaced the pan with a Wearever Pan."
3,Marginally better than 3.0,"The other books should be burned this one could stay. Skip Williams is not always on the ball but he's done a fairly good job with this one. It rides primarily on the merits of the 3.0 MM but it has enough original content to make it a fairly good upgrade. I don't blame Skip for the moronic square horses and dragons. I blame the other ""designers"" who should all be fired."
4,Monster Manual review for dog-eared used books,"The product came in the specified condition. A little beat up, etc. but all the pages are there, it works."
3,A must have for any DM,"For anyone interested in running a Dungeons and Dragons game, this is a must have. From very easy monsters to extremely challenging ones, this book has enough creatures to challenge your players with some great adventures. Plus, it has alternate races and even mixed races such as the Half-Dragon or Half-Fiend. It has Lycanthropes such as the werewolf or werebear, and has rules for creating one to play. From animals to Dragons to Mummies to orcs, this book is a great D&D supplement."
2,Faust in English with English singers. Cor blimey!,"Well, sometimes even the greatest conductors boot one.This is an old, old recording of Gounod's ""Faust."" It has been said that all that is required to make ""Faust"" a great opera is a quartet of the four finest singers in the world. Evidently, they were out of town when this recording was made.Probably the best known among the performers is the tenor, Heddle Nash. As tenors go, he was VERY English. In lighter material, even in Mozart, he wasn't bad, but he is painfully hopeless as Faust.As for the other singers, sadly, they are all cursed by English vocal training.The English singing translation used in this performance provides one of the strongest arguments ever made against translating any opera.Since the set offers a few wry laughs, I give it two stars. Put it on the shelf next to your Florence Foster Jenkins collection."
5,The Perfect Stocking & Ear Stuffer!,"I was one of the first to receive The Annoying Music Show Holiday CD, and it is incredible, annoying, funny, and frightening all at the same time. Not only some of the funniest Christmas and Hanukkah songs ever mis-recorded, but Holiday songs that only the misguided Mr. Jim Nayder from NPR would find. I haven't laughed so hard since Pia Zadora announced her world tour. Get this before they are sold out, or banned by those in power with good taste."
4,"God in his infinite wisdom, put Jim Nayder on this Earth","Wow, this CD has almost left me speechless. Who knew there was so much annoying music in the world? Well, Jim Nayder did, God bless him. This is funny stuff. The ""highlights"" have to be the Christmas songs by someone called John 'Bowtie' Barstow. The guy can't sing on key or follow the melody. Did he actually record an entire Christmas album? The mind boggles at the thought. Anyway, if you like annoying music, you should get this CD."
4,Great book...,"Really enjoyed reading this book...even more interesting from a woman's point of view. I wish more women had the ""cajones"" to ride."
4,A little jewel!,"Found reference to the title in another book I was reading. Am glad I did - a good read, from the perspective of a woman motorcyclist. Thought a bit dated with references to some current US brands, as it is written in the late '90s, nevertheless, enjoyable and informative."
5,A womans search for self and self expression by riding bikes,"A delightful story of how a woman comes to terms with her life by coming to terms with her beloved Moto Guzzi's. She broadens her outlook to include all rides and holds up to examination some old wives tales, some cliches, and more than a few real dangers.While it is more than a story and less than an autobiography the author uses her riding experinces to attempt to bring logic to explain why we indulge in knowingly dangerous activities. In the end of course, she fails, but in that failure she conveys something of the basic lonelyness of being human, and how the spirit can be set free.This is not another "" How I Rode My Bike To xxxx "" story. It is much deeper, and at times chilling if like Melissa, one rides."
4,I'll Tell You What It Is About Motorcycles.,"The author hits so many nails right on the head; I wish I could meet her. Her insecurity and uncertainty about men notwithstanding, she has written one of, if not THE, best books about the Motorcycles Mystique ever. Shame on the men, or women, that think women should not write, read, or ride anything to do with motorbikes. I've given this book to my girlfriend and my mother. That is possibly the highest review I can give it. Sure some parts of the book are lacking but so is having two wheels instead of four.This is not War and Peace, just a good winter weekend read. Perfect."
3,Another disappointment...,"It seems motorcycles are a prime target topic for authors, a hungry market. Ms. Pierson at least has plenty of riding experience, but the book is pretty thin as far as riveting tales from riding. Lots of filler on the history of motorcycles, the history of women who ride motorcycles, and of Moto Guzzi. Yawn... All her experience is limited to east of the Mississippi, largely on crowded city streets, but few insights."
1,Worst Motorcyle Book I have Read So Far,"I read the whole thing thinking there would be a point or conclusion somewhere. There isn't. The author rambles around like she can't make up her mind whether she wants to write about motorcycle history, psychological problems. love life, or travel. At no point is their any insight into why riders ride. If your looking for this go somewhere else. There is nothing useful here.When reading about areas I am very familiar with I noted several gross errors. This makes me wonder what other things are in the book that are not factual.Spend you money for another book."
1,"Good title, bad book","This thing must have gone straight from the author's word processor to the printing press without editing. Her autobiographical story reads like a sad search for companionship and an identity crisis rolled into one, disguising itself as being about motorcycling. She gets her first bike to spend more time with a boyfriend, not because she wants to ride. Even so, it can't just be any bike. The Moto Guzzi represents exclusivity bought, the ability to condescend, which she does with boring frequency throughout the book. The bike sits idle alot when there is no one to ride with her, it's lonelier than she is. She doesn't care to turn a wrench herself, or simply ride some anonymous road alone that isn't taking her to some special destination or must be there event. The used jap bike she passed over, the hogs and sportbikes she looks down her nose at, the dirt bikes she never considers, all are probably enjoyed by their owners far more than she could ever appreciate."
4,what it is about Ms. Pierson,"Melissa Holbrook Pierson's mastery of word and image makes the beginning of her book a pleasure to read. She has that precious ability to recreate reality such that, for example, I truly felt that spark of comaraderie engendered by waving at a passing motorcyclist as if I were out carving a canyon road and waving myself rather than snuggling deeper into the blankets with her tome. However, as a woman and a rider (with 29 years and over 45,000 miles of experience, respectively), I quickly became disenchanted as her writing devolved into self-pitying terror and clawing insecurity; her book became more a quest for a husband and an identity (mutually dependent, I gathered) than the essense of motorcycling. While I began the book unable to put it down, I walked away with a disturbing impulse to find the author and throttle her soundly about the head and shoulders for being such a silly twit."
1,does not work with os 5,"I purchased this product thinking, hey it's a dollar, what do I have to lose? Well, turns out the program doesn't work at all with palm OS 5, and the companies website has no support what-so-ever. Don't make the mistake of buying this, it doesn't work."
4,A frog with a bow tie?,"My 5 yo son enjoyed a read aloud from this book when I checked it out from the library a few days ago. Read it twice so far, because there is so much to see in the illustrations. Can flip back and forth between pages to see how Danielle changes the realistic world to make it less ""boring."" Also, nice message in the story about trying to help out and, as one other commenter mentioned, being true to one's own artistic vision."
1,IT STINKS!!!!,"This Game Is Not Fun In The Loosest Sense Of The Word. The Controls are Shoddy at Best And The Graphics Are UnDesireable. The Story Is Incredibly Weak. Overall, A Horrible Game"
1,Save your money-There are better Star Wars Games,"This game is not worth the shipping you have to pay on it! You never leave your StarFighter and just blast people out of the sky with no other modes whatsoever. 2 player mode stinks beyond all reason. Camera angle stinks, game stinks. I love Star Wars, but this is one of their worst. Now, if you like jerky flying, space ship blasting, no ground support games, this game is for you. But, if you are in search of a better, smoother game with more fun flying than this one, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
2,Gets Boring,"Mostly all the Star Wars video games are interesting, but this is one of the few that is boring. You keep on shifting your carachters and starfighters too,so once you find out how to shoot a proton blast or false lightning,you are moved to another ship.The setting takes place before the events of Episode 2 and it fetures transportation combat. It`s very confusing though. Sometimes like on level 2,this guy is asking if you could destroy these missles, and another guy wants you to take out a submarine or a battleship.It gets boring affter 3 hours or so,and the controls get confusing,like when you want to move your starfighter down,you`ll have to move the analog stick up,want to move up,move it down.In conclusion,it`s pretty cool,but you`ll get really bored. The only time you acctully get to have fun is when you`re using your ship and blasting all the battle droids on the ground and watching them wither into space dust."
2,X-Wing it is not,"What a disappointment. Doesn't even compare to 1992 X-Wing for PC. The graphics and sound are awesome for this game, but the gameplay is downright boring. It doesn't even feel like the space ship is moving, so all you do is hold down the fire button and move the sight around till you find a bad guy. The game isn't awful, it just feels so bring to sit there and shoot, and shott, and shoot and not have to control anything else.Play the X-wing games on pc. More ships, better plots, better missions."
4,"not bad, not bad at all.","this game wasn't exactly what i thought it would be. i didn't really like the disadvantage of not being able to change your view because i really dislike a ""cockpit"" view and in the game you can't switch. some other things were being forced to use the analog sticks to move and not being able to be more well known characters such as anakin or obi-wan. but i really like the new ""force"" powers they are so COOL!! overall it was a great game with only a few minor flaws. ... ***May the Force Be With You***"
4,oooooooohhhhhhhyyeaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this game is the best!!! Ive had it for almost a year and I still play it. this is one of my favorite games that I have. most games uselly have one player missions that are cool and you have objectives but this is the same thing only you can do it with two players I definatelly say this game is worth it!
4,good fighting game,"This game is more of a one-on-one fighter (a' la Mortal Kombat) than a wrestler, but both styles are incorporated into a good fighting game. Get this game instead of the SNES version (the Genesis version has 8 characters, but the SNES has only SIX!)."
5,Ã©tonnant,"intÃ©ressant, engageant, et vraiment trÃ¨s surprenant. A voir et pour s'informer. Du Godard mais plus encore ... De quoi s'Ã©tonner"
5,Bluebonnet,The book arrived in good condition despite the fact that it was published 20 years ago or more. Was happy to have in my possession.
1,Amazon doesn't support military,"Time and time again, I find a product online and return to Amazon to see if they have the same product. Unfortunately this product like MANY others at Amazon.com cannot be shipped to my APO address. So, I will buy it elsewhere from a store that will ship to APO. Why can't Amazon ship all products to our troops abroad?"
3,"Loving performances of Strauss chestnuts, but awfully slack","I was in a Barbirolli mood when I bought this CD, meaning that I considered his slow tempi and slack rhythms a sign of affection for these familiar Strauss waltzes. Now I wonder. The Halle plays reasonably well, though nowhere up to the standards of the great orchestras that have recorded this music ten times over. The bewt thing here is Lehar's Gold and Silver Waltz, which Barbirolli conducts as if he's making love. The rest, well, it's a nice night of easy listening with a provincial orchestra thirty years ago."
5,"Next Exit: Highway, hills, thrills, and super chills!!!","There has never been a type of movie with more allure than the thriller series. Many have scared the socks off of their poor audience, with a particular tip of the hat to ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but this movie is different. The movie tells you with its story, its tone, and its color that something will happen, but you can not put your finger on it until the end. The movie supports no ""cheap scares"" present in movies like Scream in which a scene is not scary, just sudden and startling. This movie, ""horror house on highway 5"" Will make you afraid. Afraid of the dark, and afraid of being alone. The genuine surprise ending added closure to a genuine 21st century scary movie. And, with added footage, you will not want to miss ""horror house on highway 5"" Note: This movie is only for those who are not afraid to be truly afraid."
3,Horror House on Highway 5,"I really have no idea why I picked up this film. The first dvd I got was broken but Amazon sent me a new copy ASAP. The second dvd was fine and I popped it in the player. There is a great feature on the dvd that is as long as this film but it's over horror movies in Hollywood since the 30's up till Pyscho. The quality is pretty bad but it was very good with lots of great clips. The movie itself was very, very poor qualtiy and looked like it was ripped off an old VHS. It was a decent movie but nothing out of the ordinary."
3,"witty, erudite, provacative, bodacious","Crafted by a master of hyperbole, this author has mastered the art of bringing coffee table reading on genetics to the masses"
1,horrible item,"Terrible, useless, cheaply designed and produced product. It is NOT sturdy and it sure isn't LARGE as the product description states. It is NOT even worth the $1.98 it cost to buy. I bought two of them and threw them immediately into the trash. This product should never have been even offered. I blame the manufacturer AND the seller, both."
1,lousy scooper,"Look at the edge of the scoop, that is a serrated edge. What do serrated edges do? Why, they cut into things. As in everything you try to scoop. Guaranteed to break up or get stuck in everything. Until I could get a new one the best I could do was to set the scooper upright with the serrated edge stuck into the litter down to the bottom and then tip and smack the box hoping the ""stuff"" would roll intact into the scooper. Sometimes works, otherwise you are fishing little bits out forever and your litter has to be changed sooner because of the mess."
1,Don't buy this litter scoop!,"I'm guessing the serrated edge was intended to make it easier to scrape the poop off of the bottom of the litter boxes. Instead, it make it more difficult! The serrated edge is not as strong as a straight edge, so it bends when you try to scrape the litter box. Booda usually makes good stuff, but stay away from this litter scoop!"
1,Not worth it!,This product is flimsy and hard to use. It bends when you're trying to scoop and the way the 'scoop' is designed it's hard to get the litter that is clumped to the side.
5,fun multiplayer,"this game is awesome, especially when you're playing with other people (4 players split screen). a lot of fun, must buy."
1,Worst Game Ever,This game is the worst game I've played for Xbox. This game just ruined the feel of adventure games. This is why I give this game 1 star.
5,Sold,"Heard a few cuts on WFOV. Sold. Dark theatrics of Nick Cave. Waits gutter woe. Townes Van Zandt mournful balladry. My kind of stuff. Too arch & over the top for Will Oldham followers but tread same ground. Like more than 3 tracks which is the norm for most albums far as I'm concerned. So 5 ""stars"". Fave trks: Red House, Rain & Bright Eyes"
1,Marvin Gaye - Sexual Healing,"This was a true disappointment. I did not realize that it was taken from a live show. Mr. Gaye is a brillant singer, but not on this CD. He was often off key, the music itself was often brassy, the audience was loud, it just has been a huge disappointment. If I could return it and get my money back, I would! This is the first time I have ever bought anything from Amazon.com that has left me feeling so disappointed."
5,OUTSTANDING BOOK - WELL-RESEARCHED!!!,"Marvelous book tracing the evolution and uniqueness of the ancient Mound Builders who once flourished across America. This book is perhaps the finest, most readable treatment I have encountered! Beautifully illustrated and carefully crafted, THE MOUND BUILDERS OF ANCIENT NORTH AMERICA radiates a new wisdom about these early cultures, whose amazing earthworks and technologies continue to inspire us today. 4000 years of prehistory is touched upon within these pages. Outstanding!"
3,Rock and Roll fun,"This was purchased for a fund raising event for the American Cancer Society. We were doing some real nostalgic games, and the ideas to bring in some fun music was brought up. This certanly did the trick. Such fun to go back in time."
5,this is a superb original but canterbury influenced band,Great music that has not aged one day. This will be as great 50 years from now as it is today. Prog rock with balls and excellent musicianship.
2,Bloody awful.,"If you want to hear brilliant Italian progressive rock turn to PFM, Banco Del Mutuo Soccorso, Le Orme, Locande Del Fatte, or Museo Rosenbach. This band is not in the same class. It is hard to believe that this recording was made in the late seventies. It sounds more like the late sixties. Production and compositions are dated and wooden. Vocals are weak and sometimes bring to mind an Italian cousin of Spike Jones (no not the director) on acid. Not amusing, not particularly interesting either. Musicianship is relatively competent but uninspired. Give this one a pass...Simon"
3,NFL Football 94 starring Joe Montana,"Great game for the 90's. I purchase this game out of nostalgia but in 2009 it is not the same. I purchase from Amazon and as usual, quick delivery and great customer service. I received everything as advertised. I enjoyed the game but graphics, sound and gameplay is outdated."
4,Roomy & convenient,"Great practical & roomy pack for hiking--I could carry snack, cell, keys, pepper spray and a camera. Looks more rugged than a lot of other 'dorky' fanny packs. I thought the water bottle addition would come in handy, but on my way driving to the hiking spot, all water leaked out onto the car floor. Will try to sub in a different water bottle next time. Overall, though, happy with the purchase."
2,A disappointment,"Timothy Greenfield-Sanders is a skilled portrait photographer, and we've seen his work in magazines as well as museums everywhere. A monograph of his work has been long overdue.Unfortunately, we are still waiting for a GOOD book of his work.This book denies us the opportunity to see the pictures presented to their best advantage. ""Art World"" is jam-packed with hundreds of good portraits, but they are printed very small, six to a page, forcing the viewer fantasize about the precise detail and deliciously long tonal range that surely exists in the originals. The publisher is either clueless or cruel -- I'm not sure which.Greenfield-Sanders' first book should have been a monumental publishing event -- instead it's just an unimaginative catalog sure to frustrate those of us who admire his work."
3,This work is fairly thorough but rather outdated.,"This dictionary is the most commonly-used English-Romanian dictionary in the US and in Romania, and it is definitely adequate for a tourist or for someone spending a short-term (several months) stay in Romania. The more serious language student will find, however, that many everyday Romanian words are excluded at the expense of many seldom-used words. In addition, the dictionary fails to reflect the numerous spelling changes that have occurred in the Romanian language since 1989, and ""British English"" is the standard English used in the dictionary."
1,Type is not clear,"This is a very frustrating work for a beginner to try to use. It is very difficult to distinguish between a lower case ""C"" and an ""E"" as well as an ""L"" and an ""I""."
4,Like OEM - easy install,"Trying to decide which lift struts would work on my 98 Grand Cherokee Latredo would work was more difficult than I thought - Lots of brands to choose from. The picture online helped me decide that these the right ones to try. They were right side and left side specific. They also came with the bracket and fit perfectly. I do not know how the lifts that will work with either side and do not come with the top bracket would work. Glad I chose the strong arm supports. Had to pick up a 1/2"" star socket to remove the screws on the jeep that hold into place. Only took me about 10 minutes to install both. Now the tailgate does not fall on my head - especially when it is cold out."
4,Hard to replace without star drive.,Product replace easily if you have a star drive socket or drive. Alot easier with two people - one to hold up the hatch and the other to replace.
2,This book deserves a rewrite,"Dear Mr. Schelly, I certainly respect your efforts. I wish they were better. Erich Von Stroheim said that authors should never talk about their own work, because they make excuses. Instead of excuses, why not update it? With the wealth of Langdon material available these days, and the availability of many more films, you could do yourself and the subject proud. Scarecrow has issued revised books; why not polish yours up? This is meant as constructive criticism. Harry Langdon does deserve something fitting."
5,Six stars!,"Nobody, nobody, nobody writes like Pamela Dean. Some writers have written as well, but no writer of prose has ever had a voice that somehow manages to feel like Tom O'Bedlam's song._The Hidden Land_ continues the story begun in _The Secret Country_ and finishing in _The Whim of the Dragon._ The protagonists are a group of kids of various ages, and the story is entirely suitable for either children or adults. I can't recommend it too highly; the writing sings. It's replete with literary allusions interwoven in a fashion entirely suitable to the setting and the subject."
5,right to the heart,"I love this story. The world is so full of terrible things, this will make a person feel good inside. It is good for the soul and if you love animals and nature, I highly recommend reading about Arnie. I fell in love with him right away. Whenever I hear a starling or see one, I think of Arnie and fall in love all over again. One of the best books I have read."
4,Arnie the Darling Starling,"I really enjoyed reading about Arnies story and life. It was a hard to put down book for me, having had a starling myself for 7 years. I liked the way she made you a part of her life and Arnies. I feel like I made a new friend."
4,Heartwarming,"I read this story originally in a Reader's Digest Condensed version, and hungered for more detail. This book provides it. It's a wonderful story, even though animal rescue societies are more plentiful now and more readily available to provide help to the novice bird-parent. Highly recommended if you like wild birds or animals."
4,Better Than A Mario Game? Nope!,"This game is very amazing and its the first Crash game available on a Nintendo console. But its not as good as Mario. Buy this game only if you like plataform games and love crash bandicoot.(Its not that hard, i beat it in about 4 hours, but its still a great game)"
4,EXCELENT GAME,"This game look terrific, cool music and awesome gameplay mode if you love crash you will love this game. One of the best game for gameboy advance ever made."
5,CRASH IS BACK BABY!!!!,"I have three words to say to you to describe this game: IT KICKS (...) I thought it would be pretty good since I'm a Crash-aholic. My mom let me buy it 'cause we were going on vacation, and I was afriad I would beat it before we even left! I was instantly adictied. It reminded me alot of the PS1 classic Crash Warped. I recomend this game to any Crash fan."
4,Crash hits GBA,"This game was fun from the beginning to end, but theres some problems.First of all its easy to beat. I beat it in 2 days.The power ups you get you never use unless you need to get over a huge gap.Next. The bosses were to easy to beat. especially Cortex.Last. To get to the completely final boss you have to get all the relics which i didn't bother to.The good parts of it were that it was fun like the flying areas and the bosses were fun too. The challenging one was Tiny. You'll find the pattern in his attak though don't worry. If your a Crash fan like me then get this game."
2,Definetely his weakest adventure yet!,"Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure is an OK game, and did convince me that the others are better, And they were.The pros about this game are that it's almost exactly like the consule versions. Cons? Gosh, where to start? The Graphics are dark (hard to see), There's not enough levels (20 levels. most crash games have 25.), and lastly, there's not enough stuff to do. I mean, all you do is ride a polar bear and use your jetpack.And the level design does'nt really give you something to do before the fun parts. All in All, I think this game is good, but could do better."
4,great game,We just got the game boy for my son's brithday and his aunt got this game for him. I had some time where I could'nt do nothing but wait . So I played it. Great game hard to put down. I know that if I go back I can do better and get more crystals. I love the game. My son loves it too. He really enjoys playing it. A bonse it can hold his atteniton.
5,It can't get better.,"I've read the book before. It's simply one of the most interesting and fascinating books publicated by VCH. I really look forward to read it for the second time, and I appreciate that the science library decided to buy it a couple of years ago."
3,How to motivate your students!,This is a captivating account of some of the exciting uses of chemistry. Secondary teachers will find some of this material very useful in illustrating the importance of this field. Perhaps it will even inspire some students to pursue their study of chemistry!
2,Only if you have some time to kill.,"I drink ice tea and the way it sounded like in the description that these tablets dissolve in any liquids. Well this sounded like a great idea and ordered a couple of boxes of them. I received them dropped them into my ice tea stirred and nothing happened I stirred around 5 minutes later the tablets were still full size. I had to pour hot water in a small container and stir to get them to melt, even then it took around 3 minutes of constant stirring to fully dissolve. I think the only way these will melt quickly is hot coffee. That's a huge hassle and wished I would of known that before I bought them. Get the liquid or granular instead if you don't have time to waste."
2,Stevia Dissolve,This product is far too sweet. It could do with having half the sweetness in one tablet.I wouldn't buy it again.
4,are the colors mixed up?,I LIKE THE STYLE. IT IS AWESOME BUT ARE THE COLORS MIXED UP? WHEN IT SAYS BLACK IT SHOWS A BROWN PHOTO AND VICE VERSA.
5,Would be worth twice the price!,"I didn't expect much from this device, but I've had anxiety and depression for years and after trying what seems like everything I was willing to try this one last thing. I'm so glad I did! The instruction booklet said that it could take up to four weeks of daily use to see results, but I felt a dramatic difference in my anxiety within the first fifteen minutes! I've used it nearly every day since it arrived and insisted everyone in my family try it too. If the Bio Tuner had cost twice as much it would've still been well worth the price--and that's the highest compliment I've ever given a product!"
1,Not all there,Just received this and it just came with the base and a battery! Where is the rest? No directions or ear clips?
5,diamond piont set,"These are from dremmel, and the best tip to use when working on jewelry. They will not break and are very fine for putting openings in your stones without shattering them."
5,Excellent,"I am glad that I use Dremel, Dremel bits are the best!I'm a newbie and this diamond points helped me a lot, saved the time and effort.It's a must have bit if you were a newbie just like me :)"
2,Below Par for Max Barry,"Having recently read Company, I was excited to dig into Jennifer Gov't. After all, I've always enjoyed Max Barry. I was disappointed. The premise of this satire is brilliant and creative. However, the characters were boring and one-dimensionally flat; their interactions never quick clicked. The plot was choppy, vague, and, at best, confusing. I believe that Barry himself got lost and had to come up with little tricks to make things fit. In the end, they never did fit.If you're looking to get into Max Barry, try instead Syrup."
3,Not what I was expecting,"This book was recommended by a friend and while the premis is thrilling and relevant to today's times, the delivery is a little more Monty Python than the hardboiled cyberpunk story I was expecting. I prefer my dark futures a little less glib, but fans of Python or other amusing series like M.Y.T.H. Inc. will be delighted. Very smart, very clever, but too funny for me."
3,JENNIFER GOVERNMENT MOVES LIKE GOVERNMENT,"Reading Max Barry again is fun. He is fairly brilliant. But this effort, JENNIFER GOVERNMENT fails to hit the mark. Yes, it is easy to see flashes of brilliant writing but more often this story of excesses in the corporate future gets lost in the ambition. The story gets distractersd in its own words and the intricasies of the weave. Fair, but nothing more."
3,3 stars,I agree this book is a lot like a failed screen play but the parts that are good are really good. The parts that are bad are just boring.
4,Humerous and entertaining,"This was laugh out loud funny from the first cd all the way through. (I listened to the audiobook). You can't go wrong with this book and it almost seems prophetic since we seem to be going into the theme of everything is about the almighty dollar anymore. We should all read or listen to this at some point in our lives, there is a lot to think about with this even though it is not meant to be taken seriously. I don't think you could go wrong with this story."
3,Entertaining plot but sometimes far-fetched,"Maybe it is the idealist in me, but I never could accept the idea of corporations ruling the world to the point that people would take their company's name as their own. I also found it difficult to identify with Hack, especially during his abrupt transition from total [...] to anti-corporate zealot.In spite of those problems, the book was very entertaining. I found myself engrossed in the action and eager to see what happens on the next page."
2,"Clever idea, no character development","For the first half of the book, I was excited and amused by Jennifer Government, but Barry's idea of character development is having the characters have sex. For the second half of the book, I just didn't care about the characters. There were only shallow, cliche reasons for the characters to do what they do. Also, he left loose ends at the end of the book. Three characters just disappeared. Barry's idea that corporations take over the world is an interesting extreme, but he relies too much on guns and explosions than having characters' actions make sense."
2,I paid for this?,"Maybe this would be good if you're in ninth grade. It's easy to follow, short chapters, and when it comes straight down to it, it isn't that detail oriented. I got this book because the front and back covers intrigued me. I thought it would be something along the lines of Robocop, i.e.: an attack on corporate culture. Instead... Instead I get a book that belongs in a high school library. Don't get me wrong; if I were a decade younger, I'd be thrilled with the `novel' concepts of this book. As it stands, though, I find there's too much wrong with it. It's like... It's like bad!fic, only with original characters.No, I didn't finish this book. I couldn't bring myself to kill that much time."
2,Nice try...,"With all the positive reviews this book received I was reminded of the current state of literature after reading it as it's really not that great. A catchy idea, and Max Berry can really write interesting, poppy prose, but the execution of this is as blunt as can be. This book is neither an incisive attack on corporate culture nor is it a cautionary tale with any merit. It's mostly a crass, shoot-em-up - a one-line joke that isn't all that compelling or well researched. Yet I finished it, so go figure. Max should be screenwriter, not a novelist!"
3,Not rough enough,"How do you create satire in a world where George W. leads a nation and ""The Swan"" rules the airwaves? That's a question that kept coming up as I read ""Jennifer Government."" This book takes globalization and pushes just a little into the future, where the U.S. has literally bought out big chunks of the world and people's last names are their same as the company they work for. I had high hopes as I started this book, and Max Barry's smooth and vivid writing style kept me optimistic. What's missing, however, is what drives the best satire-righteous anger. Barry can't seem to summon much rage either within or directed toward his brave new world, just a sort of world-weary cynicism. His lack of commitment failed to keep this reader engaged, and I found myself skipping through big chunks of the novel. Tons of characters with similar names and thin characterizations didn't help. So although ""Jennifer Government"" is entertaining, I'm still waiting for the great anti-globalization novel."
2,mostly for entertainment,"I found this book a little boring. I mean, the writing is written at a basic level, with simple sentences taking the forefront. The guy is hilarious on his web site, I just wish some of that humour would of went over to the book. In books, you are supposed to ""show, don't tell"", but all he does usually is just tell. At one point, he says that a character ""felt emotional"". It's bad enough if it was just ""he felt sad"" or ""he felt happy"", but not even a specific emotion here! It's not totally anti-corporate either, more like a comedy piece. Not completely serious, and not much reflection or redeeming value. It doesn't make you think much, it's meant more for entertainment. Other than that, it's a ok book."
3,"Good premise, shoddy author","I give it 3 stars just for being a fun idea. However, it seems like the book was written solely so that the author could rant about his opinions concerning the right and wrong way to run a country. I don't really disagree with him too much, but that doesn't make it a good book. I get the impression the author just slapped his impression of U.S. capitalism on top of Melbourne out of convenience.The result was that the plot is weak, the characters are unrealistic, and the whole thing is just a chore to read. A book taking place in a radically capitalistic dystopian future should be fun and enlightening, not dull and eye-rolling."
3,"Overplayed, but interesting","I read this book for the first time about 6 years ago, and decided to reread it on my kindle on a whim. I found it overplayed, but it certainly kept my interest. The world Barry paints is a very interesting (and terrifying) one, but at some points he goes so far over the line that I have a hard time buying into it. There is political satire, and there is fiction, and there are adventure novels - this tries to be all three at once and ends up using one too many cliches in the process.All in all, a fun book, but I'd recommend you pick this up at a used bookstore rather than pay the kindle price."
5,Incredibly Relevant,This is a great easy sci-fi read. It shows what happens when pure capitalism is allowed to run rampant. The government has lost almost all power and everything is ran by large mega-corporations.There was recently a shooting involving a pair of Nike shoes at a midnight launch and it made me think that this book was written a little too close to home.
3,jennifer govt review,"the premise is quite good, however the author doesn't follow through on the implications of corporations controlling the market place and acting like the government (and effectively displacing the role of the government in an alleged democracy as we know it). nor does he really explore the implications of paying the government to investigate and prosecute cases (the idea that all services are for sale, although the services to buy protection aren't as effective as those which can take a life). aside from those shortcomings which leave you feeling unsatisfied after finishing the book (in addition to the inconsistent character development), it's still a quick and entertaining read. when barry does make an attempt at character development he does do a good job."
2,"satire of something, just not capitialism.","Having heard of this book, I thought it would be a good dystopian read. However it seemed to be a critique of free market capitilism something of which the author doesn't know a thing about. Characters loose their identity by having last names as the place they work. Two world conglomarate systems. The use of people as a means to and end. A business reduced to mere profit. Rights limmited to how much you can buy them. A government only to the extent that it has no purpose other than to serve the highest bidder as well. Weak characters, one dimensional. Though an easy read and not totally unenjoyable."
3,Good But Not Great,"I read Jennifer Government in two quick days; one a coast-to-coast airline flight and the other day waiting around a courthouse. It is good entertainment; fast paced, easy-reading. You won't want to put it down as a bad book.However, Max Barry could have pushed it so much further. The first 80 pages you marvel at how brilliant his ideas are, but then he gets bogged down in the transcontinental plot and all the characters. He runs out of steam a bit, and you wish that this could only be a draft. Acts II and III are not as hot as the opening. It's no Brave New World, but it is a good effort.Examples of what I mean: explaining Jennifer Government's tattoo, for one thing. It would have been so much cooler if EVERYONE were bar-coded--then Max Barry could have explored the strange connection between letting capitalism run free and yet eliminating personal freedom (i.e. tracking everything about everybody all the time for their buying habits etc.) Anyway, a good early novel."
5,"great story, quick read","I started reading Jennifer Government after a friend introduced me to Max Barry's online game, NationStates.com. After reading the description of the book, I thought...yeah! This is right up my alley. And I was so right. What a great novel. I loved it so much I bought Barry's other book, Syrup and I'm anxiously awaiting it's arrival. If it's anything like Jennifer Government I know I'll love it."
3,The Future Yawns Before Us,"Jennifer Government had a wonderful concept but it was just a little too much action for me; I prefer more building of characters through dialogue and what they're thinking. Still, it was a well-fleshed out plot with a satisfying good vs. evil moral ending, along the way sprinkled with humor and a darkly satirical view about the place of marketing and big business in our society today."
2,"Good premise, terrible storyline...","The premise of an dystopia uber-commercialist society sounda like an easy sell, but the author has managed to stuff it up. I got the sense he was trying to emulate the Orwell classic 1984 with the uber commercialism idea, but the story is so mudddled and confusing. It chops and changes from character to character so quickly...I got almost none of the storyline itself. Yes, I realize that sort of storytelling people like (books like Cormier's I Am the Cheese prove that)...but not with me. Good idea for a story, but in my opinion badly executed."
3,Entertaining for 100 pages...but...,For the first 100 page of the book I found it hilarious and entertaining with a keen wit. But after that point the whole premise seemed to dry-up and become overdone and terribly boring. A joke is only funny so long...
3,"Heavy concept, light execution","Although the concept of the book is excellent and very timely in light of current business and terror news, the execution of the plot leaves something to be desired. Characters are rendered with a light hand, leaving much of their motivations a mystery and resulting in a disconnect relative to the serious issues being raised. Some key turns of the plot are similarly brushed over, leaving the reader to wonder why a scene or scenes were included in the final edit.Still, it's an entertaining read and a fun way to spend a couple hours. I recommend it to readers who are not looking for a serious indictment of capitalism but rather a fun take on the issues."
4,"Great Concept, Good Book","Some of the other reviews for this book say that the executuin of this book was weak, but I disagree. For the ""capitalizm"", consumerist, corporate world it is lampooning it is exactly whqt it needs to be. Short Attention Span Theater in book form. The chapters are short and brisk without any fluff and get right to the point. It is also excellent satire on our consumer culture and where things seem to be going in this country. The only negative I would have to add is that in the end nothing really changes. Max Barry illustrates the problem weel, but has no solution."
4,"Dark, Satirical, Funny.","I guess these words describe the writer, Max Barry (or Maxx, as he ironically called himself before, only to be shot down for it!) as well.The premise of this book is a world controlled by corporations. Everything is privatized, including the Government. People often take monikers describing who they work for (As per the books title). The book stars a cast of characters, each with different perspectives. From the corporate shill hired to kill a few people to hype a new pair of shoes, to a man who is mistaken for another person in the NRA, to the brilliant computer programmer who finds herself betrayed, to our books heroine, Jennifer.A dark, yet delightful look at what might happen if corporations ran the world."
4,Great Look Into Corporate America's Future,This is a provacative book that catches your attention immediately. What happens when the government's power shifts to corporate america? Read this book to find out.
3,Much better than Gibson's Pattern Recognition ...,"... but that's not saying much. The plot is somewhat chaotic and meandering. The characters are somewhat thinly drawn. But the dialogue is crisp, and the story is interesting. The story isn't that tight, but it does come to a decent conclusion with most loose threads taken care of, which is a lot more than I can say about Gibson's Pattern Recognition. Worth a read, but not spectacular."
4,Worth a look,"Imagine a world where government is reduced to begging for money, police are privatized, all roads are toll roads, schools are funded by Mattel and McDonalds, no one cares about your politics or religion but being in the wrong customer rewards program can get you beaten up or killed and dead consumers are just a marketing expense. This is the world of Jennifer Government.After five years on my ""to-read"" list, I finally picked it up and it was worth the read. It is an idea book and I think, not as funny as ""company"". Maybe the satire stops working as we get closer and closer to Barry's vision.The game it inspired is a lot of fun: [...]"
3,The Weakest of Barry's Three Satires,"Having read and highly enjoying both Syrup and Company by the same author, I was highly disappointed with this satirical and sometimes funny look at a future where companies rule the country and all individuals take on the last name of their company (ex. Hack Nike). The mysterious title of Jennifer Government refers to a government lady named Jennifer Government who is a relentless type of police officer.What really disappointed me about this book is that after you get the idea of what the world is like in this tale after about 50 pages, the rest of the story just loses steam. Both Syrup and Company seemed to grow the plot as the story went along."
4,jennifer government,"The seller was good, but the book is quite dry. It was required reading for a summer reading list, and thus, a necessary evil."
2,Coulda been cyberpunk if only,"With some of the same themes as classic cyberpunk (in particular, corporations taking over everything), you'd think this book would fit in naturally with that genre. But I don't think it does, mostly because the book is too satirical..too obvious. I like my cyberpunk more subtle, not where the author is saying ""see how clever I am?"" Too me cyberpunk is also a little more dark (perhaps post-apocalyptic), and a little more future, not near-future. Cyberpunk often involves technology too, and this book does not use anything science fiction or high tech. So while the social commentary themes are similar, its just not really a good match. I mostly enjoyed Barry's ""Syrup"" but this book was too over-the-top for my tastes. I also did not care for the short scenes in this book...I think they were intended to help keep the action moving, but to me they were like forcing me to be ADHD."
4,Embraces the ridiculous along with the scarily plausible,"Set in a world ruled by corporations more than the increasingly powerless government, everybody takes on the name of the organisation they serve. Jennifer Goverment, the eponymous heroine, valiantly struggles to do The Right Thing while working to exact a spot of revenge on her ex, John Nike.The National Rifle Association and the Police provide the firepower for a no-holds-barred competition between the only two Customer Loyalty Programmes left in existence after cross-industry mergers and things get ugly. Corporate politics, a real killer marketing campaign for the latest pair of trainers and some hapless idiots add light relief to the plot which bravely embraces the ridiculous along with the scarily plausible."
4,Good...,"Jennifer Government is a very fun read, and is very entertaining. The concept is good, if obvious, but the satyr is adequate. A lot of people criticize this book for not being in depth enough, but i think it accomplishes exactly what Barry set out to do. Just to illustrate how entertaining the book is, I finished it in less than 2 days! I just couldn't put it down. I think that Max Barry is an excellent story teller but needs to work on his satyr. Excellent read for anyone looking for a good, entertaining novel by a developing write. Also check out his first book, Syrup."
2,Clever Concept but Weak Execution,"This is a clever idea but I found the execution quite weak and unsatisfying. Unfortunately, the author simply wrote a comic book in a very flat text format utterly devoid of style. The characters are paper thin and entirely plot driven, where ridiculous coincidences keep thrusting characters into each other's reach. The dialogue is usually flat and uninspired. The whole thing collapses into a very silly cartoon very early in the book.I also find it troubling how cavalier the brutal murder of children was treated in the book. Yes, it's a satire. But in an age where Columbines are real, some sense of epiphany and responsibility would have made the death of children other than entirely gratuitous."
2,Unfocused,"While reading this book, I expected to have to have a little suspension of disbelief. Too much was required here. One of the main ""funny"" points is people take their sir name from the company they work for. How'd this come about???Other things: How did most of the world come under the US's direct control??? And why does the author have a beef against Nike??The biggest thing I had with this book is that the government can only prevent crimes. The prosecution of guilty parties must be paid for by victims, i.e. no money, no jail time. Societies could not function if under those conditions. Revolutions have begun on less. This is a socialist's over simplification of what would happen if free markets were to take over some of government's functions."
2,laughable,"While I do enjoy a good dystopic novel, this one is laughable. The very idea of corporations taking over Government is hilarious. We must always remember one thing: the Government is all, it can never be defeated. Sure, they allow the big corporations to think that they control the Government, but once the Government is through with one corporation, they will destroy them and move on to the next. The Government doesnt even need corporations to survive. All this crap that you hear, ""The rich rule the world,"", ""the corporations rule the world"", no no no. The Government rules the world, always has and always will. They could destroy any corporation, whether it is Microsoft, Shell Oil Company, or Bank of America, with swiftness and efficiency. So to any corporate exec reading this, remember, you and your measly corporation are no match for the mighty Government."
4,Great for toddlers who love animals,"My 18 month old really enjoys this DVD. She loves all the animals in it, and it maintains her focus. The discovery cards were a nice bonus as well, but the print on them is upside down, so it is hard to show your toddler the card and read the discussion points. Hence the 4 stars. Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for babies under 1 since the pace of the program won't keep their attention, but it is nice for older ones. Otherwise, a very cute and well designed program."
5,Helps develop language skills,"I started my daughter who is now 18 months on the Your Baby Can Read dvds and she started speaking a little earlier. Once I tossed these discovery kits in the mix, her vocabulary has flourished. The videos are simplistic and appealing to the eye. The music that goes with the video helps to lull my little one to sleep as well at naptime."
5,Animals Around Me Discovery Kit,They were just what i expected. We used these DVDs for younger grandchildren and wanted to use for new baby. Baby Einstein: Animals Around Me Discovery Kit.
5,Great for toddlers,"I have an 18 month old son who loves this dvd. I watch it with him and observe him when he watches it - he's learning the sounds of the animals, also the names. If your child loves animals this is great. I would recommend to all parents."
3,Print quality mrginal,"Print quality is not consistent, needs too frequent cleaning. Maybe it will get better with use or a couple more cleanings."
2,doesn't work good in my printer.pictures are faded and streaked,"worked fair for a short time, but color photos are streaked and not sharp. wouldn't buy it again . going back to dell."
1,my experience with eforcity.,"I ordered a set of dell ink cartridges from eforcity in january and when i received them, the color cartridge only printed in red and the black cartridge lasted for 2 pages of printing. i was very dissapointed, as i have ordered these same cartridges from amazon several times and they were great. it took me 4 months before eforcity returned my money to me. this is not good customer service.i told amazon that i would never use their company again but my daughter changed my mind. i can't blame amazon for one bad experience with a company, so i am trying again through another amazon company to get my cartridges.as long as the cartridges do not come from eforcity, i will try one more time."
1,Old Lexmark cartridges w/ new stickers - they didn't work.,Not a drop from either the color or black and white - Huge waste of money and time.
3,Yes to color,"The color ink cartridge was excellent, but the black ink cartridge only worked for a while in the highest printing quality, and then it just went dead. Now it does not print anything!My recommendation is to only buy the color ink cartridge."
2,Print quality questionable,"This product is certainly priced right for the remanufactured cartridge market, but the quality of the ink transfer is a problem. The best description of the issue is that, for example, with a laser printer if the toner is not fused to the paper it smears badly and in some cases can be wiped completely off the page with as much as a puff of breath. This product is an inkjet item that does not require fusing since it is actually ink, but even after a couple hundred pages having been printed, the ink still smudges and is uneven. BTW, all tests have been performed on the Dell printer for which the cartridges are intended without any failures. The alignment and nozzles are AOK as well."
1,Didn't work,They were either clogged or dried out or something. They didn't work. Nothing I did would fix them. I installed them very carefully and followed the instructions. Would have been better off buying new ones.
2,Dell T0529 &T0530-2 Pack-Back & Color Ink Cartridges,"Very pleased with the color cartridge however the black cartridge has streaks in the printing. I cleaned it according to the printers instructions several times but this made no difference. Anything I try to print in black is streaked and unreadable. So, I am displeased with this product because of this flaw."
2,Dissapointment,"This DVD is extremely cheap looking. You can tell Simon Cox just wanted to cash in on the Da Vinci craze at the moment. There are several scenes where the sound drops out, or someones voice is out of sync with their mouth! The shots are all amature and from bad angles. At one point someone moves in their chair, and then all we can see is their shoulder! Aside from all this, the actual doco is just plain boring! It doesnt shed any new light on anything from the book, and the people they interview are dull and ramble on for too long. Also the supposed ""interview"" with author Dan Brown, is just a clip of him talking at a writers convention, for all of 30 seconds! Avoid!"
1,OMG! -Appalling=(!!,"Well I'm certainly a fan of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" but this is certainly not for those who have seen the recent ""The Real Da Vinci Code"" hosted by Tony Robbinson. For starters, it is nothing more than a badly put together, POOR quality production. Just Read the 1-2 star reviews here - I totally agree with them. And to see just how many different versions of ""The Da Vinci Code"" documentaries there are out there (quite a few - about 8 out there!)- this is perhaps the worst. Do not waste your money here!Pitty I had to give this at least one star=P"
1,What a Letdown.,"Some of the reviews hit the nail on the head. There should be some nails banged into a coffin into which this dvd should go.It was bad,bad,bad.Do not even bother watching it."
3,INTERESTING PART- DOCUMENTARY / INFOMERCIAL,"First there is absolutely ""NO"" relationship with the book by the same name. Second while the DOCUMENTARY does a ok job of examining the key points of Dan Brown's Novel it depends far to much on the ""speculations"" of Picknett and Prince. Thats where it becomes an INFOMERCIAL for Picknett and Prince and their book ""The Templar Revelation"" which in all fairness is mentioned in The DaVinci Code.While clearly enlighting the viewer on Dan Brown's sources it falls short on proof and facts."
2,readable could have been better,"2.5 stars if given the option. I felt that this book would have been a better read if it didn't focus so much on the heroine's prior relationship issues. The heroine was extremely negative, sometimes rude to the hero even though he was pleasant to her. Sophie was so hung-up on her previous marriage and how her ex-husband used her as eye-candy that she wasn't able to move on. The relationship didn't seem as it had enough time to truly grow and become bonded."
1,Lack of teaching overall,"Hi All,I got nothing at all from this DVD. To mee Troy Dexter is just showing off in about 45 mins , thats it. There is no usefull breakdown of licks he plays etc. So I guess this isn't really for the beginner into rockabilly. I later bought the DVD with Steve Trovato and he's a much better teacher, and is really breaking down the styles and lick so you understand them. I would definetely recomend that on instead and save $15 for this one."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is absolute garbage, Troy begins by talking about getting the Rockabilly sound and although he uses the right equipment still manages to miss by a mile.The title claims to recreate the techniques of some great Rockabilly players,one of which being the Reverend Horton Heat which i was very interested in. But again Troy fails miserably (oh how i wish the Reverend would publish a book or DVD).For anybody wanting to buy a good quality DVD of this style, my recommendations would be after grabbing almost everything i can find on the subject of Rockabilly guitar. Titles by Paul Pigat and Jim Weider, next take a look at Arlen Roth. I know Brian Setzer would seem an obvious place to start, but his technique is rather unusual and hard to pick up."
2,"""COBBS' "" ....SOMEWHAT ""CORN""Y","I AM A BLUESHARP MUSICIAN AND HAVE A LARGE COLLECTION BLUES HARMONICA ARTISTS. THIS CD IS NOT THE WORST BLUESHARP CD I OWN....BUT IT'S CLOSE. THE BAND HAS THAT, ""WHEN DO WE GO HOME?"" ATTITUDE. AND COBBS' VOCALS AND HARP PLAYING FOLLOW CLOSE BEHIND. NOTHING REAL SPECIAL ON BOTH COUNTS. I'LL TAKE TRACKS 5, ""AMNESIA"", 7, ""IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS"", AND, MAYBE THE HARP PLAYING ON 11, ""CARNATION MILK"". BUT 2 AND 1/2 OUT OF 13 IS BAD ODDS. THIS CD? MOSTLY ""CORN"" ON THE ""COBB""S. JERSEY SLIM"
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,Play this game for about 20 minutes if you can't sleep. You'll be out in no time.
3,how is the game,THIS GAME IS EALLY GOOD. NOT THE BEST BUT VERY GOOD. YOU SHOULD BUY IT PLAY IT & IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT RETURN IT
3,Not the best game for true trekkies.,I give this game a 3 out of 5. This single player campaigns are severely weak. The only fun there really is are on the skirmish missions. You get to pick your race ship and up to 2 other ships for your fleet. You can also download missions for the skirmish campaigns that can almost make up for the single player campaigns. There are a bunch at http://www.strategyplanet.com/sfc/ along with patches and anything to do with Starfleet Command. It has good graphics but still is in 2-D. If you just want a trek game that isn't hard get this game.
1,Bugs and More Bugs,"Doesnt work out of the box. I have emailed interplay and have received no response. This game has more bugs then any other i have seen. Each patch promises to fix them, to no avail. The first one was great Empires at war is the worst second i have ever seen in any game. I bought this game for the name. Taldren who actually wrote it is probably the worst company I have ever had to deal with. After getting no response i posted on the forum asking about the bugs and my posts were deleted. All you will see on the forum are filtered messages genereating positve press. The game looks great but after playing it for a while you will lose ships, Lose cash or it will freeze up right when you tink you are doing good. Buy at your own risk."
1,One of the most disappointing games this year.,"As a die-hard SFC fan I eagerly awaited the release of what I hoped would be one of the best games of the year. Sadly however I was woefully disappointed in the ""finished product"" or should that be unfinished product. To completely list all of the bugs would take more space than I have here. The most annoying is the near total lack of single player missions (you get one with the game) and tutorials. Also the sound effects and music do not work; nor do some of the hot key commands. Also the game crashes regularly and often requires a complete re-boot of the system. In short save your money and get something else or wait until a fixed version is released."
1,Complete waste of time...,"After seeing the first one, I thought that this would be a distinct improvement, and the bugs in the first one would be ironed out in the second. Of course, I was completely wrong. The ""campaign""-level interface is completely useless: if you think that you are getting some kind of strategic deployment of forces, think again. In fact, the new ""Dynaverse"" engine seems to do practically nothing except to hand you random and pointless missions that are either way too easy or way too hard.Due to these inadequacies, coupled with the myriad bugs present in the game (which have not really been fixed with the patches), I would not recommend this game. Stick to the first one."
1,hunk a junk,There was a star trek game in the series of star trek games that I had tried and was great -this is not it. Unfortunately I paid a premium in purchasing this outdated hunk of junk in the hopes I would reclaim the game I had tried. To list top problems would be 1) very buggy -ie crashes which are nothing to do with my system 2) poor game interface 3) boring repetitive missions. On top of this I will not buy used again as the condition of this item was terrible (and when does a seller state that?). This was stated good condition -an outright lie.
1,Blue Sea Battery Switch,"I'm sure this product will work for some people but I returned it. The package was open, there were no installation instructions included. I did not have a lot more luck with the internet, including the Blue Sea page. They do not tell you that you need to cut and splice wiring, purchase mounting screws, cables, buss or fuse blocks, etc. This is more trouble than it's worth. Before you buy this, you need to know if your alternator has a separate (or, a built-in) voltage regulator and then hope you can figure out the right wiring to not blow out the diodes."
5,sweet and amusing,"I just read this book to my 3 year old son and he loves it. I don't think he can grasp the moral of the story yet, but he loves the story itself and the pictures. It is sweet, loving and responsible. I think it is because it teaches following through and taking responsiblity. Each individual who has hurt Pinduli's feelings realized how he had done so, explained why he did such a thing, went back and confronted the source of his irritation, who then went back and confronted the source of his irritation and it was brought back to the first individual, who owned up to his action and changed. All this was done in an amusing and loving way. Read it to your child because the book is much better than the convoluted way I tried to explain here."
2,not a good message,"This book was cute, but ends horribly. I thought that it was going to come full circle and we'd follow the chain of teasing back to when Pinduli herself teased another animal. The opportunity was there for a very good moral... instead the reader learns that teasing is bad, but getting even is ok.I bought this book to read at Girl Scout camp in a series of reading sessions meant to help Brownies identify things that they can do better in their lives to make the world a beter place. If I do decide to use this book, it will be to teach that not everything you read teaches a good lesson.I was very disappointed with this book, expecially since the author has so many other wonderful books. I expected better."
2,deception......,"When I bought this cd I was thinking about something between Frank Frost, Lightnin Slim and Big Jack Johnson. It is but much under each of them"
4,"Fine resource on politics, military of medieval Tibet.","Beckwith covers the early history of Tibet forthose of us who do not read Chinese, KhotaneseSaka, and other fun languages. Places theTibetans in the constellation of nationalempire-builders. Well-written and exhaustivelyfootnoted, this is not a coffee-table book, yetis accessible to the non-specialist. Should beof interest to political and military historiansof the milieu, as well as to Arabists, CentralAsianists, and Sinologists.However, suitably rewritten and with many colorphotos this would make a fine coffee-table bookindeed."
4,A thoroughly entertaining read for the hifi nut!,"Like spending a Sunday with your gearhead friends, there is a lot of useful information for the enthusiast here. Plenty to agree with, plenty to disagree with, but most of all good, old fashion hifi fun.Ken Kantor Vergence Technology, Inc."
1,Not for lovers of quality music,"This book should deliver much more than it does, in my opinion. Why would anyone seek out and wish to buy a collection of discontinued music titles, no matter how ""good"" they sounded when they were avialable in shops ten years ago? And ""good"", incidentally, in Mr. Ferstler's opinion, means a load of bass and a treble control set to maximum. I was further irritated when Mr Ferstler goes out of his way to discourage people from listening to classical music, implying that CD's limited frequency response somehow impairs the performance. An utter shambles, in my opinion."
4,Effective for Those Who Desire to be Effected,"Things you should know:1)This is not some new age technique; there are NO feel-good meditations to be found here. This book is intended to drag you, kicking and screaming, to your own destruction. You will not enjoy many of the techniques; change is painful.2)It helps to be familiar with a system of magick (namely Golden Dawn or Thelema). It HELPS, it is not necessary. The book will not encourage you in any way to be a part of any order or group.3)You don't have to believe everything in this book. In fact, if you do you've probably missed the point entirely.4)You are wasting your time reading these reviews. It is irrelevant to you whether myself or others felt liberated or disgusted (or both) by this book. If you think it sounds interesting: buy it. Find out for yourself."
4,I haven't read Gurdjieff,"I think this book communicates some of the same message as GIG though. I really liked this book because it changed the way I think, and parts of it are going to be stuck in my head for some time. I almost gave it 5 stars, but the meditations part of it really made me feel [...]. I've tried them and tried them, and I have no idea what is supposed to happen - but I'm not getting anywhere. I find the meditations to be quite a chore for what I've gotten from them. He also throws in some of his style of tantra meditations after you finish the introductory ones (where you flex and hold and release every little part of your body until you start to really hate doing the meditations). I even got the Regardie tapes (recommended in the book), so he can scream the mantras from my stereo while I lay there and try to avoid thinking of the time. I bought the book for the meditations, I'll remember it for everything but."
3,Pretty Good...I guess,"I like the overall makeup of this book, as it's very unconventional and it gives the reader a kind of jolt out of the what to normally expect. As for the exercises, I have heard of similar ones before, so I did not try these specifically. All in all I think this may be helpful for some, but not everyone will find what they want here."
5,"Powerful, driving and intense.","Diverse and powerful, ""a matter of physics"" defines today's sound movement. Some tracks harken back to a 60s-esque overdrive while others have an almost soulful aura. Definitely worth a buy if you like original compositions and musicians not afraid to express themselves."
5,Best tote ever!!!!!,I love this!!! I bought two of them for myself and my husband. We just returned from France and we loved these. There are so many compartments with so much room. And best of all they weigh next to nothing.
3,"Useful, But Small","The Rick Steves Travelin' 9-Inch Toiletries Kit is mostly useful, including a pull-out pocket with hanging hook for three small items such as shampoo or liquid soap containers (not included) which can go directly into the shower. The largest item I was able to pack in one of the kit's side pockets was a 7 fl.oz. can of shaving creme, and that was a tight fit. Larger items simply will not go into the kit and must be packed separately, defeating the purpose of having a single kit that can go from suitcase to hotel bathroom. However, the kit is well constructed and easily accommodated all smaller toiletry items."
3,"Did the trick, I guess","I wanted to keep my Blackberry away from my pockets were I usually have items that can scratch my phone. The holster did the trick, I guess, but felt very flimsy."
3,Viastat worked more effectively than the prescription I had,"I am more satisfied with the results I obtained using Viastat over the ""sex aid"" I was perscribed. This seems to help me not only in the bedroom but I feel a bit more energetic during the day. It's like someone breathed life back into me, it's like I'm ten years younger my wife has noticed a difference in me also. I will continue to take vialstat"
5,Awesome results with Viastat,"Before taking viastat, i was lacking in the bedroom, down on myself, upset with my performance, and not satisfying my girlfriend. Viastat has helped me tramendously, my girlfriend has been satisfied with my performance latley, and it has boosted my confidence in myself."
4,Brilliant Product!,"I am very happy with taking this supplement. I never thought I would see the day that I have to take a ""male sexual aid"" but since being openly gay I got really shy and unresponsive to my lover(s). I am only 32 years old and since comming out I lost the ability to maintain an erection. Viastat undeniably helped me get my groove back!"
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!,"I have been trying another product which has not worked for me in the past, finally just started to take viastat. WOW! I was knocked off my feet when i started using it. It improved everything that needed to be ( would not like to get into detais )but you should know. ;)"
4,Just placed my 1st order,I have heard alot of great things about this product from people I know personally. I can't wait to use it.
1,Fake reviews all over,I tried to use this product but it gave me brutal diarrhea. I wish I had realized these are all fake reviews.
1,It may cause severe allergic reacton.,I don't know what is in it but it made me sick at midnight. I think it was a severe allergic reaction. It was so bad that I will not take any more of it. I tried Zencore before and it worked for me but I was looking for something less expensive but I wasted my money.
1,Disappointment - None of these things work including ViaStat,I lost my commonsense and actually thought something like this would be fun to try and I would impress my wife with an [....] that would last for hours. Of course no such luck. In fact nothing happed except for a bad aftertaste and a little buzz in my head. Unfortunately it wasn't even the head I was hopping to effect. I continued to take the pills twice a day for a week and still nothing. If you are looking for some fun this is not it. If you have a serious medical problem see a doctor and forget about the crap you read online.Hope this helps.
1,NAUSEA NAUSEA NAUSEA,"I'm writing my 1st review so I can warn people just how horrible this product really is. I took this product twice all I got was DIZZYNESS AND NAUSEA, abolutely zero sexual arrousal. Under product reviews do a <ctrl F> (find) and look for the word ""neaseu"" or do a google search for ""Viastat blog"", you'll find that the word ""Viastat"" and ""Neusea"" go hand and hand everywhere you look. What is this POISON?THIS PRODUCT NEEDS TO BE RECALLED ***BUYER BEWARE***"
1,SEX KILLER...TAKE VIASTAT AND YOU'LL BE SO SICK YOU WON'T CARE ABOUT SEX!!,"I ordered Viastat to hopefully help with andropause symptoms and problems.I received my order promptly but the product is a nightmare. I took the dose of two capsules indicated and I woke up with burning in my stomach, terrible nausea (which caused me to throw up)and headache/dizzy feeling.Because of the upper & lower GI distress I thought maybe it was something I'd eaten the night before for dinner...perhaps a touch of food poisoning. NOT! Later today I decided to take one capsule instead of two. I had the same reaction. Viastat is a really nasty product. I learned a few years ago that I cannot handle Yohimbe (which makes me terribly sick). Viastat does not list Yohimbe as an ingredient but the reaction was so similiar for me. I intend to return the product to the vendor for a refund. The manufacturer is lying if they claim no side effects with Viastat. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SUPPLEMENT!"
2,work knee pads,"The gel in these pads are fine, but like all knee pads the problem is the constant adjustments needed to keep them in place. They also came bent on one side. The straps are not held in place well partly because the clips don't grab onto them and hold."
3,Light Duty Back Stop,"Bought this net to use during softball batting pratice for the outfielders to throw into like they would the cutoff man. The veritcal uprights have bowed inward with minimal use. Good net for the price, but not the heaviest duty on the market."
1,Rio Carbon,"I purchased the Rio Carbon back in January,2005. Not wanting to be locked in to Itunes, I felt the Rio interface with my computer, and easy transfer of my wav. files on my hard drive to the Rio Carbon would be no problemo. Was I ever wrong!...here's the scenario: I am now on my fourth player. Problems from buggy software,firmware,broken scroll wheel (twice)non-functioning menus, etc., hours spent with their tech people.....a friggin' nightmare.Don't buy this piece of junk and save yourself much grief."
1,Absolutely HORRIBLE!!,I bought this after many online reviews and I was quite disappointed with it. My main reason is due to the fact that the machine DIED only after two weeks of use. It was in no way mishandled either!!Buy with EXTREME caution.I KNEW I should have bought an iPod.
1,Broke and issues with USB port,"It took me a few days to get it running because plugging it into the USB ports on the front of my system didn't work; it had to go in the back. And this was not obvious. We figured that out, and got the music on it. The next morning I went to turn it and it was dead.I've bought an IPOD and I love it. Worth every extra penny."
3,unsure about the sound quality,"i wasn't sure between the rio carbon 5gb or the ipod mini...they were the same price, but rio was 1gb more, so i got that. when i used it...1. i had trouble transferring the songs into rio....the 2 arrows kept spinning and then it said done...but my songs weren't in there...and then it froZe. 2. i'm not sure..but the sound quality wasn't very good....i don't know if it was just how the songs should sound or it was the earphones or just its quality. the songs i tried to listen to were the few songs already in the machine. I wasn't familiar with them so i am not sure how they should sound, but what I heard was unclear static music. I looked up the songs online, and they did sound more enjoyable online, so i think maybe it is the machine itself. Did this happen with anyone else? Were the songs supposed to sound like that or was it the machine?"
1,Big Disappointment,My computer had a problem locating the drivers for the Rio so I called their customer service line. After waiting on line for about 45 minutes a customer service rep. spent 1 1/2 hours trying to help me with no results. I was able to make the device work after some trial and error on my own only to find out that the on/off button was getting stuck probably due to poor design. I am returning the Rio and getting an Ipod.
2,Could have been a true ipod killer,"I have had this player for only a week and already it has died out on me. For those who are wondering, rio fixed he static problem and my sony headphones work just fine. At first it was great. A few navigation gripes here and there but other than that it was perfect. Then I get a black screen and irresponsive buttons 3 days later. I reset the carbon. It works for 4 more days then it dies. Perhaps a change in the manufacturing might help fix this. As for me, I'm returning it for an ipod mini. From what I've heard it's MUCH more reliable."
1,Worked great for two months.,"Got this as a Christmas present for my daughter. After two months, it won't do anything, won't emergency rest, nothing."
1,"DON""T BUY THIS>>>>>>>>>>>>!","I bought a Rio Pearl with a 90 day warranty. It died about 85 days later. Neither the authorized Rio dealer (internet) nor the amazon merchant PCMONDE would honor the warranty. In fact the authorized repair/dealer said that the Pearl has not been made since 2003. If you buy this item, you will be a victim as I was. Rondie the sadRio Carbon 5 GB MP3 Player"
1,don't waste your money,"I purchased this MP3 player less than a year ago and it is already broken. I researched all MP3 players and this Rio Carbon received great reviews and seemed to have everything that I wanted. It was great for about 8 months, although it would occasionally turn off randomly when listening to music. Then one day I turned it on and it had ""UPGRADER"" mode written on the screen. I went to the Rio website and tried to install all versions of firmware which is suppose to rewrite the hard drive (and erase all music files on the player). This did not work, and either did the countless phone call to Rio's support team. All they could offer me was a refurbished player for $99. Do not waste your money on this MP3 player, I am not the only one with these problems either, there are lots of reviewers that have the same problem, and tapping it on the back doesn't do anything. If you do decide to get this MP3 player, I STRONGLY suggest getting the warranty."
2,owned 4 of them,"I've owned four (yes four) Rio Carbons. I have purchased two and both of them failed within 6 months. The front panel controls are easy to use and in general it is a nice player. This is an excellent sounding player, unfortunately it has the following defects- 1. it is subject to failure from shock and a portable player WILL be dropped at sometime or another. 2. It has a combination volume control and selection wheel which is both over sensitive and too fragile if used during exercise or physical activity. 3. It is SLICK and (see above) has no attachment point for a lanyard or other device to prevent dropping it.I had to upgrade the firmware upon receipt of all four players and cannot figure out why Rio couldn't get that done at the factory especially since two of these were refurbished warranty replacement units that came out LONG after the firmware upgrade.Rios customer service is very good and I wish the player had been nearly that good"
4,decent-- but really want an i-pod,"i saw this other review on this, and it said if your a kid wanting to fit in with an ipod, don't get it. I tottally agree. So far i've had no problems, it's just been a bit laggy when i scan through my music on it pretty fast.. then theres that thing when u select a track from the menu, you can't just bush the buttons left or right, you have to go BACK to the menu, and push ""play all"" which is tottally a waste of time.. unlike the ipod. Plus, the case really stinks.. i don't use it at all. one thing was that there was already a scratch on the mp3 when i got it. If you have a child, do not get this for them... they would much appreciate an ipod! Oh yea, don't even think about an ipod mini (not sold anymore) and it turns out that apple has to fix the ipod nano- it was faulty! i've had no problems so far.. it's working smoothly.. adults, buy it!"
2,Would Be A Great Product If....,"...if the volume wheel didn't break so easily. I first got my first Rio Carbon for Christmas. Exactly one week later, I've got it in my pocket during school, I pull it out sixth period to find that the volume wheel has been pushed inside the Carbon, making it impossible for me to change the volume. So I take it back. This time it only takes me 5 days, and viola! Volume wheel breaks again. It fell out of my hands 5 inches above my desk, and the same thing happens. I don't feel like returning my MP3 player every week, so....I'm just gonna get a refund and buy myself an iPod."
2,Go with the Ipod,"So I thought I'd be different and go with this Rio Carbon. I debated between this and a mini Ipod but, it appealed to me because it was smaller and held one more gig. However it stopped working on me, within the 90 days, but because I was out of the country I could not ship it or have acess to my warranty so now I am out of luck and they are saying it costs $99 plus shipping to fix/replace. My advice, don't get it."
3,Good Mp3!,"I had the Rio carbon for more than a month and i have never ran into any problems with it, it runs flawlessly and smoothly, Although the case is a lil bothersome but besides that its a very good Mp3! using windows media player is soo much more easier than using i tunes when transfering songs from computer. This lil device has a lot to offer that the ipod doesnt the battery life on the Rio lasts soo much longer than the ipod mini, less expensive and small enough to fit anywhere! i wouldnt want anything else!!"
3,"Nice small size, no good case, no folder navigation","Pros: The size is very very compact, easily fits even in jeans pockets. The sound quality is excellent. The headphones are great. The response time for navigation keys is excellent. No software required to only transfer files. So serves well as storage device.Cons: 1. The supplied leather case hides the main navigation controls, and you have to pull it out of the leather case if you want to navigate. Currently, there is NO OTHER CASE available in the market !!2. It is not possible to navigate by folders. You will have to tag all your music collection, and make playlists. Of course, playlists can only be made on the rio software !"
4,Great Product as long as its not a limited edition,"After Months of waiting Rio finally released the Rio Carbon LE. I quickly snatched it up from Rio's wed site with a special deal. I loved this player for about 2 months when it stopped working!!! Rio's Customer Service is the worst I've ever had to deal with. When i finally got a hold of someone she told me that there was an error with the design of the LE and to send it back. I did so and still havent recieved a new one. They sent me an email saying it was shipped then the next day sent me another one saying that there on backorder. I told them to give me a refund, still havent gotten it. This all started about 4 months ago and I'm still without an MP3 player. I still want a Carbon but I'm nervous about buying one of the Carbons from Best Buy or Circut city to get the same problem. The Rio Carbon is the best player for its size(5gb players) but they really need to work on their service and support."
3,rio mp3,there are some technical difficulties with this product.when it's working properly it's wonderful.i think maybe we just got a bad one.
1,$99 to repair after initial warrenty.,Im yet another sufferer of the volume control wheel poping off.And since it did such with the volume low....which in my opinion this player could use to be abit louder...this player is now completely useless as anything but a small audio storage device.Another complaint I have is with the audio jack...using headphones that dont ahve a plastic stoper when connected to the device causes a great deal of static with movement.And since Rio is going out of buisness...the product is no longer worth anyones time or money.Never had any other issues with it....it was decent before this incident.
4,"Very good player, but alas Rio is no more","The best features of this player are, in my opinion, the self-indexing ability (drag & drop music without software), the great battery life, the small size and good looks, and the high sound quality. Also, some will find the Janus-DRM compatibility (for Napster & other subscription services) very handy.I wish it had the ability to create playlists on the fly, and that the scroll wheel wasn't so crucial (if it breaks you cannot adjust the volume). The first Carbon I had died (the hard drive stopped working and the player would error out to upgrader mode), but luckily the replacement plan I purchased came in handy.Bottom line: A great player for its time, but now with Rio out of business, there are probably better-supported alternatives."
5,Rio Carbon is well worth the money!,"I've had my Rio Carbon for about a month and I love it! It is small, has long battery, and you can store so much more than the ipod mini. My friends have the mini and would defend the Rio Carbon up against it any day. It is less expensive and supports WMA. I have almost 1,000 songs and it is only half full! I definitely recommend it."
4,Great Sound... Short Charge,"I agree with most other folks that this device posseses great sound, and that the design is fantastic. However, I do think that the manufacturers mis-stated the life of a single charge. There's no friggin' way my Carbon could last 12 hours of continuous play!"
1,"Awful, how do people get off calling this junk/iPod killer?","Where do I begin? Firstly, the sound quality is inferior to that of the iPod. I used the same exact MP3s ripped from my CD collection for my iPod at 160kbs. The sound was radically inferior. I found part of the problem was the Rio earbuds, the iPod earbuds are far superior. I have a sneaking suspicion that RIO is aware of the inferiority of their product, for while Apple's iTunes defaults MP3's at 160 kbs, Rio's defaults its MP3 ripping and encoding at 200 kbs VBS! This means that the 1GB more you get over the original iPod Mini is meaningless. The kicker: today my Rio broke after less than a months light use. Rio Support is a horrible. Res Ipsa. Or as my uncle used to say: ""buy cheap, pay twice."""
2,Looks cool and sounds great but...,This little player looks cool and has great sound but. About 20 percent of the tracks skip like an old record player.(I thought we were way past that!) Rio support's response was upgrade the firmware which had already been done. When I informed them of this they disappeared off of the face of the earth. I don't know about you but that is totally unacceptable. Whatever happened to SERVICE in this country.Buy an Ipod and avoid this crappy company. It will work properly at least until until the battery dies.
1,Avoid like the plague!,"Rio's products are horrible, and the Carbon is no exception. Looks nice, but will break within weeks. The controller pad failed on me, making it half useless. Not to mention that the battery is not replaceable and so when it dies in 1-2 years, so will your Carbon."
1,Dont waste your time..,"I have owned 2 different rio products, both of which have failed me within 4-5 months of purchase. The life expectancy of their mp3 players is poor, as is their waranty, as I was told that for 100 dollars and the unit they would give me a new one. The hard drive went out on both mp3 players, and I was told that your not supposed to move the player when its in use.Never mind the fact that its a portable mp3 player. Other than the fact that its hard drive died, my rio nitrous was an outstanding value....until it died. Dont take my word for it. Check out what everyone else thinks on epinions.com"
1,"RIO SUCKS !! DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM RIO, YOU WILL BE SORRY",as I am after buying a Rio Nitrus. I will save myself a lot of work: Just read the reviews for the Nitrus.
1,Take your chances.....,"Well, the carbon is good in ease to use as well as pretty good battery life. Be warned though, the little volume wheel is very cheaply inserted in the player and if you drop it, or even press hard on it, it will cave in into the play itself, and then you can ajust volume or navigate the menus fast. When i had mine, it did this exact thing 2 times, and after spending 100 bucks to get it repaired, it breaks again, and i decided to buy an ipod and have never been happier. My advice, skip this and buy a 4 or 8 gig nano, or a Creative zen."
2,Think Twice,I had high hopes for this product after reading reviews in the PC/computer mags. This is not a user friendly device. Copying audio and transferring it to the RIO is a gamble... Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Tech support is poor. No 800 # and long waits on a long distance call. Check out all MP3s before deciding.Beware of this one.
1,Do NOT buy a Rio Carbon!!!,"I will never ever buy from Rio again! I had the Rio Carbon for exactly 4 months and it broke! I suspect it's the battery and you can't replace the battery. I called Rio Support, long distance, of course. Rio Support wanted $99 to fix it. Forget it! I will not pay $99 for something that will mostly likely break in 4 months again. I may be a fool once, but not twice. I am going to buy a Creative Zen instead. My niece had a Creative Zen for a little over 1 year. She dropped her Zen and it broke. However, the big difference is that she called Creative and Creative sent her a brand new replacement for FREE! Yes, that right! Creative sent my niece a brand new replacement, a new model too, for FREE. That's what I called great Customer Support. Rio Carbon should take a lesson from Creative. Rio Carbon SUCKS!!!"
5,Better Then The Ipod Mini,"During Christmas break I was very upset when I opened my gift to see a Rio Carbon MP3 player. I wanted a damn Ipod but, my parents being the good consumers they are said that the Rio Carbon was much better. At first I thought they were lying to make me feel better but as I used it more and compared it with the Ipod, The Rio is the better deal. It has 25% more storage space than the Ipod mini. It is also much smaler than the Ipod. Also had a great battery life. I love the Rio and I am glad my parents got a great MP3 player!!"
1,Negative Experience,"Only one person's experience, but I purchased this and had to send it back for three replacements to try to get one that would last over two weeks without suddenly going blank and dying. I eventually gave up as it is too expensive to keep shipping it back to the RMA center. As other reviewers mention, returning a Rio Carbon likely will result in receiving a refurbished model.I ultimately went with a Dell DJ, which works well."
2,"The sound is OK, but quality and customer service are poor",The volume wheel of my Rio Carbon broke few days after the warranty period (90 days) and the Rio customer service does not care about it. I do not recommend this player especially due to the poor customer service. I bought my Rio Carbon for $249.99 four months ago. Its price dropped down to less than $179.99 !!!. It is pretty easy to guess why?
2,Fantastic while it lasted,"Like one of the previous reviewers, my player conked out. It was a great little easy-to-use player but just upped and died on me. I've had it for only seven months."
3,Beware. . .no repair,"Bought the Rio Carbon and loved it at first. I carry it about everywhere. The other day I bumped it right on the power button. The button got pushed down and in to the player. You couldn't turn it on if off (had to plug in the charger and it would turn on) or off if on.Anyway, I emailed Rio support and they told me there was no way to repair it. I needed to buy a new player./sigh"
3,be delicate,"trust me on this one people, BE VERY CAUTIOUS WITH IT! the roller wheel on it can brake easilly with just one fall or flaw, I found mine broken I picked it up off my charger. If you are considering buying this it is a great MP3 player. My friend has the same one and his isnt broken, but just be VERY careful with it."
2,RIO knows something,"My sons purchased a Rio Nitrus for me in April 2004. It lasted until August 2004. When I contacted customer service to fix the problem, they informed me I needed to purchase another player since the ""telling"" 90 day warranty had expired. I gave RIO another chance and upgraded to a RIO Carbon for $249. After about 5 months, the display screen burned up. I contacted RIO again. They offered the solution of buying another Carbon at $149 since the 90 day warranty expired. The current sales price with a rebate for a Carbon was $179 at that time. I declined their offer, since it appears they know the lack of reliability of their product which is why there's only a 90 day warranty. If you aren't going to use their product on a daily basis, it may be a good product. It's functionality is very good. If you plan on using it daily, let the buyer beware. You may be spending $500 a year for a $200 player"
1,Stay away from Rio Carbons -- They're Highly Problematic.,"I am extremely disappointed with the Rio Carbon-- I would not recommend it.In the first month, I had many problems with the player not starting, the player completely freezing, and the player constantly shutting down in the middle of play.The final straw was when the jogger dial caved in. The player had not been dropped or jolted in anyway.When I sent the player in, they sent me back a ""refurbished,"" i.e. USED player. This used player was heavily scratched up on the back. I did not pay full money for a new Rio Carbon only to receive a used one.And now, I am having the exact same problems with this ""new"" player. The jogger dial has once again caved in without provocation. The player continuously shuts down in the middle of play.And to top everything, the customer service is highly adversarial and certainly not helpful or sympathetic.My advice? Stay clear of Rio players."
2,Forget this one,"Purchased Rio Carbon last January. After numerous calls to Rio due to faulty software, firmware, etc., I then had to have unit replaced three times! The scroll wheel broke twice! Rio has gone out of business, having sold out to another company.The price has dropped 30% for a reason. Stay away!"
4,Nice player,"This my second Carbon in 7 months. I bought a second one because the one I got for Christmas only plays for about 30 minutes on a full charge.Rio wants $99 to swap it out for a new and i will do that but i didn't want to wait. So i guess this is a bad news good new review. Bad news battery is dead after 7 months, good news i like it so much i bought a new one."
4,Great tool for the job,"The Turbo Shear attaches quickly and easily and does a very good job at cutting fiber cement siding. I've seen some other reviews stating that they cut 1/2"", I do not think this tool is intended to cut that thick of board.The main draw back as stated by others is that you cannot cut a very sharp arch. Also this tool does create SOME dust, but it is very slight and falls to the ground - not into a dust storm as with a saw. The other slight con is that it can tear the corner on the exit of a cut. But this also has to do with the way the board is held while cutting. If you are cutting solo expect to have something to firmly secure the end you are cutting off. Fiber Cement planks are heavy and quite flimsy when laying flat. Another tip is cut with the back of the board facing up, comes out cleaner."
3,You get what you pay for!,This product does what it is supposed to do - but -! The main housing broke on mine after relatively little use!!!. After taking it apart I realized that the pot metal main housing where the axle for the bottom jaw resides is paper thin. If it has very much stress at all it is bound to break. In my opinion this product may be good for small do-it-yourself projects but not for commercial work. If you have to depend on a tool like this go ahead and spend the money for something like the Pacific Shear # SS424 which is what I replaced this with.
2,Not good for Nichiha siding,"I couldn't get a clean cut in 1/2"" Nichiha siding - the back side was mashed to a pulp. Returning the tool."
4,I use it for soldering jewelry,"I am just starting out as a metalsmith, and I use this torch for jewelry. I've soldered copper, fine silver, and sterling silver with this torch and haven't had any issues with it. It's great for copper in particular."
3,Nice little multi-station while it worked,"I didn't really use it for scanning or printing purposes, but the copying function worked quite well until recently (lifetime of about 3 yrs). During copying function now, there seems to be gear grinding noises .. but copying is still functional. Toner is expensive, at approximately 1 hundred dollars.Pros: Cheap, small footprint, not-heavy, copies at moderate speed.Cons: Starting to malfunction at 3 yrs time (can be expected, cheap product), toner is expensive"
1,"Bad product, crappy software, worst tech support","First, Xerox claimed that they support Windows 2000 Professional, which was totally bogus. The ""new"" driver for Windows 2000 on their website is the one for Windows NT4. Tech support was the most imcompetent bunch I've ever seen. I was told conflicting stories by 3 different reps. Then the last person I talked to stated that USB connection only works on Windows 98, and does not work on WinME or 2000. It was funny the person I talked to before that said Windows 2000 only works with USB connection. Oh, they DO NOT ship a USB cable with it. If you buy the damn thing, you have to run out buy your own USB cable, only to find out it does not work. This WorkCentre only functions as a walk up copier right now. I would advise any who are lured by Xerox's cheap price and sales promotions to reconsider. If you look at the drivers on Xerox's web site, it have not been updated since 8/1999. I guess that is why Xerox is having finacial problem."

3,"Cheap, but not that cheap","Small, easy to use. Supplies are a bit expensive given the fact that they have to be replaced every couple of days."
3,Good Phone,"Great phone. everything was well thought out. It is big and heavy though so you can call it a ""Man's"" phone. It's not for these men or women walking around tryin to be all cute - it looks like a brick. But thats exactly why I love it (its my style i guess). As of now it has gone to the scrap yard though because the flex cable linking the phone body to the flip screen gets damaged easily. (I've owned 2 MPX220's and both had the same damaged flexcable issue in 6-8 months after a brand new purchase). So I would say if youre a technician and you can buy 3 or 4 extra flex cables, go with this phone."
4,"Excellent sequal to ""Under the Influance""","This work expands ideas of the disease nature of alcoholism introduced by the early 80's book ""Under the Influance"", of which Ms. Ketcham was co-author. It gives very good insight to the medical/genetic/physiological contributors to this desease, along with meaningful options for those wishing to recover and to those whose lives are impacted by other's alcoholism. Insightful, fairly straightforward (some of the medical sections are technical), and informitive. Worth reading by addicted persons and those involved with or impacted by their recovery."
2,Not good enough,"Beyond the Influence is a rehash of the Ketcham's 1983 classic ""Under the Influence"", which earns five stars. True, there a smidgen of new information, but the presentation is tedious. The introduction of fairly technical biochemical and genetic information in the beginning of the book was enough to drive me to ... buy Ketcham's first book.I bought the book in hopes of giving it to someone who needs this information immediately, but the book was unsuitable because of the stultifying format. I feel that this book should be on the bookshelf of an addictions treatment specialist, but if you need to give this vital information to an alcoholic, you're better off with ""Under"".The reason that it earns only two stars is because the authors are experienced enough writers to know better. The new information could have been presented in appendices to a new editon of ""Under"" with better effect. This being said, the information is timely, accurate and useful to some."
4,Beyond the Influence,This is a required text for an Addictions class I am taking. It is an easy read and holds a lot of pertinent information. I would recommend.
4,very interesting,Really helped me understand the physiological happenings around alcoholism. Highly recommend for anyone with an alcohol problem or who knows someone that does.
1,AA Bait,"If you are seeking alternatives to Alcoholics Anonymous, this book is useless to you & a waste of your money. It is nothing but 12-step promotion under pseudoscientific guise. The research is sloppy (the average American consumes 156 pounds of sugar per year [p. 222] is only off by 100 pounds or so, the story on p. 259 about the United flight forgets the fact that the guy had a digestive virus, & p. 288 misspells the name of the Northrop Corporation [now Northrop Grumman]).Save your money & buy something else. This is just expensive propaganda that is no new information to a Twelve-Stepper & no alternative to those looking outside AA."
3,Ehh.,"Gorgeous animation like most Funimation productions are but the story is rather convoluted and there's not much in the character development. I found it kind of annoying how every time they merge their Aquarion, the characters seem to have and orgasm. Mobile Gundam is still my favorite giant piloted robot series."
4,Great Mecha and Romance: The ending could use some work,"I enjoyed this anime, both the mecha and the romances that took place. The ending could have been a little bit better though. All-in-all, this was a great anime."
2,Pretty darn lame,"Aquarion is a pretty lame anime. The story has a lot of potential, the battle scenes are fairly decent, and there is an okay love story involved. The problems with this anime are pretty major though. The characters are kind of boring, the voice acting is bad, and the story drags sometimes. This anime had a lot of potential, but in the end it failed to impress. I have a lot of mediocre anime series that I keep just in case I get a wild hair to watch some of it later on down the road. Aquarion, however, is not one of those shows. As soon as I watched it, I took it to FYE and sold it to them for like 5 bucks. That is something I don't do unless an anime is really bad. It's in the same category of bad as 009-1, Beyblade, and Legend of Crystania."
4,Cool,it has very good plot line and I liked some of the characters that I saw. it was very good just didn't like the ending
4,It's worth picking up,"I remember watching this series for the first time when i was 15 or so, I would say that this series was made for 13-17 year olds since the plot is so simple and easy to follow. After having watched it a second time now years later, I would have to say that it's not as good as I had rememberedLet me start off by saying that this show has some of the BEST music I've heard in any anime series periodThe characters are well drawn and are likable. I would say that this series succeeds in it's first 10 episodes and then meanders til the last arc. As a complete box set it's pretty bare-bones, but for the price it's definitely worth checking out"
2,Blech,"Didn't much like them, I have to say. Their voices were weak...too stringy and too uninspired. John McDermott and Finbar Wright fare much better if you're into this type of music. Try ""Ellis Island"" or ""Live From Belfast"" by the Irish Tenors if you want good Irish music...listen to this CD if you like listless showboat [stuff]."
1,Not quite the Irish Tenors,I also bought this thinking it was the Irish Tenors and feel [like I was taken]. They are the same songs only the voices are thin and lacking in quality and style. The only thing that I liked about this CD was that the arrangements were simple and in keeping with the music. Otherwise poor quality.
5,SOMETHING SPECIAL,This is it! Atlantic Shore by the Three Irish Tenors is just out of this world - brilliant. Without question one of the best CD'sin my collection. She moved through the fair is stunning. I really can't recommend this one enough. Buy it find our for yourselves.
1,Not what you might think...,"I bought this CD thinking it was the Irish Tenors (Ronan Tynan, Anthony Kearns and Finbar Wright). I was disappointed when I opened my package and saw three other gentlemen on the front cover."
3,Good and Bad,I picked this seller because they listed the pattern number. So I know it was the one I was looking for. However the condition was not what I expected compared to the other sellers descriptions. There is some price sticker damage and handling damage on the edge and a bent corner on the cover. These damages must be common on this pattern book because the other sellers listed similar things. It was shipped very quickly and packaged carefully.
5,Great teaching video,"I have been studying about Kibera for about 2 years, and was able to go there in July, 2008. This video beautifully captures not only the visual Kibera, but also the need for compassionate action to help meet the hopes of its children. I have shared this video with people young and old as a tool to help them understand what it means to have little but hope."
4,Not Bad,Seriously not a bad movie. Acting surprisingly good and effects pretty nice as well. Kinda wanted there to be more movie but I suppose it left itself open for a sequel.
5,B masterpiece,"This film is everything a B movie should be. gratuitous nudity (all female, what's the deal, Apatow broke the full frontal male!), lesbians, fishermen, murderers, preachers and great gore. The lead guy is hysterical and he delivers his lines with a classic comedic timing. His last words in the movie will just keep you rolling."
2,Meh,"Part of what makes Evil Dead so fantastic is that it was made to be scary -- that it fits into the B-movie mold so well was an accident. Brain Dead feels like it was made to imitate that style, but in trying to create that 80's feel it crammed puns in to every line delivered, stuck a naked breast in wherever they could go, went overboard on cheap gore/music effects, and forced the rubber-suited monster down the audiences throat. It tries so hard to be in the ""Cheesy 80's Horror"" category (no pun intended), it goes overboard. It almost looks like massive amounts of money were spent on what, in the 80's, was created with corn syrup and food coloring.If you don't mind the 80's thing being forced into every crevice of a movie and love, love, love that style no matter what, this is for you. If you prefer the made-to-be-scary, accidentally funny, 80's Horror (They Live [free with Amazon Prime], C.H.U.D. [$2.99 to rent, 9.99 to buy on Amazon]), I suggest you skip this one."
4,"Slow start, Good Movie","Brain Dead starts out painfully campy but quickly hits its stride and becomes entertaining (if still campy). The performances seem a little stiff, at first, but as the film continues they grow more natural and the characters grow on you. It doesn't break any new ground in horror, zombies, or B-films, but it is an entertaining way to kill an hour and a half."
1,Don't bother.,"Not worth the click. I regret the decision to give it a try. Do not make my mistake. But if this does not stop you, remember, you were warned."
2,"Run far, run fast...","None of these actors could act their way out of a wet paper bag to save their lives, and the writer(s), director and producer(s) should be bitch-slapped into the next county for letting this thing go past initial discussions."
2,That's what I am after watching this movie.,If it wasn't for the hot naked chicks there would not be much of a reason to watch this flick. Just wish the church lady would have got drilled at some point.
2,There are better zombie movies out there.,It's not worth spending a lot of time critiquing this movie. (min of 20 words) The acting was mediocre and the script was less than that.
4,Awesome B movie!!!,"This is a really fantastic little flick. First let me say that I am an aficionado of B-movie horrors. There are several necessities for these to appease fans of this genre, including interesting amusing characters, gore, and a good amount of nudity! Spectacular special effects or established stars are not requirements.This movie succeeds on many levels. The story is simple, solid, and good! There are several funny characters with hilarious dialogues! The women are varying degrees of attractive and the nudity is there! The main actress who plays Sherry is absolutely gorgeous. Hope to see more of her in more movies. As an aside the recent 'night of demons' remake FAILS miserably because of the limited nudity; only one of the actresses gets her top off. Its amazing that old b-movies get remade now with the nudity gone. Those filmmakers simply dont get it.Anyway this movie is great. Great likable characters. Very funny dialogue. Cheap, but gory and cool effects."
1,Not what I thought,"When I first discovered this title, Brain Dead, I thought it was the long awaited exposÃ© of liberal intellectuals in America. It was not. Bummer. Just another run-of-the-mill fantasy romp."
2,This book ain't the one,"I've been working hard on a Ph.D. so it was with great relish that I turned to this book after getting some time for myself. However, I was sorely disappointed with what I read. Octavia Butler's story started off quite decently but the ending was not up to the rest of the story. And it was downhill from there. I've never read two science fiction stories in a row I haven't liked but this book represented a series of them. Some of the stories had good potential but the writers didn't develop them well and some were just not good. It is my opinion that many of the stories would have been much better if the writers had a publisher/mentor like the early sci fi authors who critiqued their stories and helped make them better. Perhaps critiquing or mentoring is what sci fi needs more of. I have started another sci fi anthology and already it is better than this one."
1,What a disappointment!,"Even though it is advertized as a sport player. It is not durable enough. The worst part the player stopped to power on after 90-day-warranty expired. The rio customer support squeesed out ""sorry"" as a final word in my case. Well, actully before the final verdict, they offered me to repair it for $49 which I found insulting (bought the player for $80).My final words - ""Never Rio again."""
1,Do Not buy This!,"This device has many problems it turn off, problems reading SD Cards and bad sound quality, i do not recommend this item,I am a computer certified expert, and i do not like it at all, bad usb sync and has too many problems"
1,typical Rio dependabiliy,"After reading these reviews, I had to offer my own experience. I previously bought a Nike PSA Play and had nothing but problems. This product was made by Rio to be sold under the Nike label. After dealing with Rio's so-called tech support, who couldnt do anything for me (it was an electronic defect), I decided not to buy another Rio product. Nike eventually switched to having Philips manufacture their MP3 products for them - judging from all of the negative feedback I've seen posted, I would guess it was because of the number of problems. I would have given Rio the benefit of the doubt by saying they were just in a hurry to get a new product on the market, but repeatedly seeing bad reviews about their current product line makes that excuse seem unlikely."
1,Junk - Please don't buy,"At first thought that people were not giving the product a fair shake in their reviews. Because of the price and the features, I thought I would give the Forge a shot. BAD DECISION. I worked great for two weeks (even the radio worked.) But today the thing just died on me. I tried five different batteries but it just won't power up.If you want something that works great for two weeks, this is your player. If you want it to last, look elsewhere.ZERO STARS"
4,"this is a good, cool and good looking mp3 player","I was afraid, very afraid of how the mp3. after reading many reviews, saying that is stop working at the week, it didn't work, or it simply suck. but after trying the mp3 myself, I proved that all that people was wrong! the mp3 worked fine and everything worked as it was suppost to do. even the radio is not that bad. when the mp3 arrived to my house the first thing to do was update its firmware, then follow all the orders and I charged my song. I was able to put 30 songs on it. the next day, I went out and it worked very fine, in fact, this is a cheap and a very good mp3 player."
1,What a bummer,I received this player for Christmas-my first one-and it was nothing but trouble. The sound was alful-like it was comming from inside a tin can. Then I realized it had filtered out all the main vocals and I was hearing only backup vocals and music! I tried repeatedly but nothing worked. The only bright spot was Best Buy who took it back no problem. I bought a MPIO for about the same price and LOVE it.
1,JUNK,"I bought this for my wife for a birthday gift to workout with. It never worked from day one. It shut off all the time on its own. I recently downloaded music to it, and it would turn on and off non-stop (like trying to re-boot). I used fresh batteries, with no improvement. It quit working all together. It is now in the TRASH, it may (and I emphasice MAY) have been used for a total of four (4) hours. What junk....."
2,the volume button fails,I received my mp3 player 9 months ago and volume button stopped working. I use the mp3 player and I had someone at Circuity City look at; There representative said that button is missing. Contacted Rio audio but i getting the run around. Everything else has great until know. Rio audio representatives are aware of this problem. I don't waste the dollars on this mp3 player. I will be purchasing ipod after this week.
1,Ack,"For Christmas I roderered this for my Mom, at first I loved it. She used her S35s (very nice for its time) until it had a meeting with pavement, skidding it 30 feet into oblivion. However, I open the unit it works, the FM tuner could use some work but its probably OK for running. The headphones are good, but they do fall out lots.However, I thought I was sold on this unit until is suddenly stopped working on the same night I purchased the unit. Rio has not respinded to any of my support claims yet."
2,not worth it,"The rio forge has some nice features like the FM tuner and SD card reader, but it has serious reliablity issues, especially with buttons that stop working. I got this unit for ~$35 refurbished last year, so it was a pretty good deal at the time, especially with an added SD card. The buttons on my player eventually stopped working after half a year, but I was lucky and as able to resolder them without any problems.The battery life also sucks (a dozen hours or so)Anyway, by now your better off getting a refurb 2nd gen 1GB shuffle for $50, or a tiny 4g player for a little more than $100."
2,disappointing,"I bought this book about a year ago when my son was a high school senior, and was briefly considering not going directly to college. The edition I have is copyright 2000, so perhaps the content is not the same as the item listed here. But when I looked into a number of the programs listed, I found that many actually required some college, or a specific field of study, or required participants be a certain age, or turned out to be unpaid volunteer programs rather than jobs or paid internships. I'd prefer to think that the 2000 edition is simply out of date (the research was probably done five years ago, or more). But I'm reluctant to recommend this book, at least for the purpose I sought it out -- finding opportunities for high school grads who don't want to go directly to college."
5,"A Worthy Successor to ""Teenage Liberation Handbook""","The UnCollege Alternative is a thoughtful, creative guide to exploring possibilities with, or without a traditional college education. It is truly a natural next step to Grace Llewellyn's classic ""Teenage Liberation Handbook"". Unschoolers, homeschoolers, freethinkers and those unsure about college ought to give this book a read."
1,False Advertising,"Amazon's review says 2500mg (2.5grams) of creatine phosphate per serving, but when you get the bottle it says 250mg per serving! Dont bother getting this, it's sugar water. 250mg wouldn't affect most anyone."
2,Earlier types were better,"I don't know if its a different formula, but I do remember taking the old school ATP three years ago and noticing a difference. I don't quite see the same results as last time. I used to be able to rock the gym for 2 hours without feeling tired. Sure my muscles wouldn't work, but I was still ready to tear them up some more. Not sure what happened, but I want the old stuff back!!!"
1,caution !!! total junk & not backed up,"It sounded great in the ad, it was JUNK! The DVD recorder I received took extremely long to upload the videos that it would. Many of,, if not most of my DVDs would not play what so ever! Of the ones which would play, after very long, very noisy load-up , movies often skipped a few seconds at random. Stay away.After this I did some research & found MANY other such reviews(too late) At one point, discount jungle even admitted they found the same when they researched it! (something they later denied when I wanted my shipping reimbursed.)To add insult to injury, Both amazon & the seller discount jungle, decided that despite the fact that I never received a working product, I WAS HELD LIABLE FOR SHIPPING BOTH WAYSMy days of buying through amazon are over"
2,It has a problem that makes it worthless for 1080p TVs.,"Bought 2 of these for the 1080p Flatscreen TVs I have because it is still too early to buy a Bluray player(too expensive and technology still evolving). After connecting these to TVs using version 1.3 HDMI cable (that is the latest for true HD sound and 1080p processing), I played a movie to test the picture and sound. The picture had snow and spec in it and the sound kept cutting off with a fixed frequency like a broken record on both. Downgraded the HDMI cable to version 1.0 and it was working fine. So I returned both and bought two Sony 1080p upconverting players instead, they were cheaper and worked fine with the latest version 1.3 HDMI cable.It looks like the firmware is not upward compatible with newer technology and it is not upgradeable either."
4,This is the all around no brainer DVD burner/player,"I love this thing. I have U-verse with a DVR. I can source the DVR and burn DVD's and finalize them so easily. I have a FLIP Ultra HD video cam. I make my movies on the Flip software then copy the finished movie back onto the flip cam and hook it up to the D-R400 with the mini HDMI cable and poof, all done. I can convert my HI 8 movies to DVD's too. I have had the D-R400 for a few years now and it is still very reliable. When it breaks I will look at any new technology that is out there. I just got Apple TV and as far as I can tell, I should be able to record from there as well. As I say, it is a no brainer."
5,WOW WHAT A VALUE,I PURCHASED THIS ITEM BASED ON THE OTHER REVIEWS......I RECIEVED IT LAST NIGHT......I HOOKED IT UP TO MY SHARP AQUOS HI DEF TV......AND TO MY HI DEF TIMEWARNER DVR CABLEBOX......THIS ITEM IS JUST WONDERFUL........YOU CAN FIGURE THING OUT PRETTY MUCH ON YOUR OWN BY PLAYNG WITH THE REMOTE.....AND IF NOT THERE IS THE MANUAL.......I'M WAITING FOR AMAZON TO DELIVER MY HDMI CABLE TODAY AS I AM AT PRESENT USING COMPONENT CABLES(RED GREEN BLUE)......EVEN WITH THE COMPONENT CABLES THE PICTURE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT......I MUST SAY IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A UPCONVERT DVD PLAYER 1080P WITH A BONUS OF BEING ABLE TO RECORD YOUR FAVORITE PROGRAMS...THIS IS YOUR BABY..........YOU WILL THANK ME
5,Delivered on-time and very good price for what I need,Delivered on-time and very good price for what I need: copy VHS to DVD and occasional TV recording.
4,So Far So Good,"I received this recorder for Christmas and really haven't tried too many recordings. But what I have done I am satisfied. It is definitely more complicated than a VCR. I probably won't use the multitude of features that this has, as all I want to do is put some old VHS tapes on a DVD. The price was right and since this is my first dvd recorder it appears I have picked a winner."
2,Very Disapointed,"If you're buying this unit to record movies or lenthy shows off the (HD) TV, forget it and go with a high end video recorder for much less. If you record a show in excess of one hour in time length, the playback picture is downright lousy (grainy & blury). The picture on regular store bought movies was just average. 1080P? I usually like Toshiba electronics, but I just can't recommend this item."
2,No cable/ satellite box... don't buy!,"So, I got this upconverter/recorder to give as a christmas gift. It doesn't record if you do not have a cable/satellite box. Otherwise, the upconverting works good... If you do have a cable/satellite box I suggest you purchase and HDMI cable for the best picture."
4,Solid unit that delivers good picture to HDTV,"Delivers very good quality picture on my 52"" HDTV. Remote a bit busy but buttons are clearly labled."
5,Great DVD recorder,It didn't take long to be on my way to making dvds off of my dvr and vcr. This was a valuble assest to our electronic arsenal! It showed up in a very timely manner. Way to go. Looking forward to coping our mini DV tapes to dvd. A small investment for keeping family memories and more!
5,Toshiba DVD recorder D-R400,"I received this DVD recorder and was amazed how easy it is to use. I recorder from my camcorder and the DVD came out great, however you can not record from a pre recorded tape. I was hoping I could record all my Disney tapes but you can't. Overall I really like the quality of this unit. I could not get the recorder to switch to the front jacks, I called the hot line and in no time I had it working. I'm happy with this purchase."
3,DVD recorder OK,"I replaced an aging Panasonic DVD recorder and chose the Toshiba from the reviews. After living with it for a while I can say that the Toshiba is a much less refined unit that the Panasonic. First of all it's clunky and noisy. When you insert a DVD it clunks and when it's running there is whining and gear noise. Also my biggest complaint is that you can't get around the DVD as easily or as quickly as with the Panasonic. The Panasonic had a 200X speed advance, the Toshiba is probably about 40X's max. Also, when you reinserted the DVD in the Panasonic it would automatically go to the last place you viewed. Not so with the Toshiba. On the Toshiba you have to manually mark the last place and even then it only finds it some of the time."
4,Great DVD recorder for price.,"This Toshiba is a slick and fast way to record a DVD. Very easy to use. The only thing is that you must use DVD-R and not the DVD+R, for whatever reason a disk with the + does not finalize. It plays + just fine,just does not like to record on one.For the price its a super machine."
3,Toshiba D-R400 Tunerless 1080p Upconverting DivX Certified DVD Recorder,"I'm sure this is a decent product. Was not able to adequately test/use it as I needed one with a built-in tuner (which this model does not have). Toshiba apprently makes a similar product with a tuner, but reviews here weren't entirely positive. Decided to buy a Samsung instead."
4,A Great recorder that won't hurt your wallet!,The Recorder is still working after almost 6 months of use.The LP speed produces a decent picture and better than other DVD players but not as good as a Panasonic though Panasonic DVD recorders usually die after 6 months and you have to get them repaired or buy another one.The only problem is I wish it would produce more detailed menus with thumbnails and pictures after you finalize a DVD.
1,No good,"This product has copy protection built in that prevents recording many broadcast and premium channels, which for me defeats the purpose of buying a DVD recorder."
4,Very good for the price,This is a very good DVD player/recorder for the price. It is very easy to set up and use. It is slim and looks good in any home system. The upconversion feature is of questionable value. A major consumer magazine said that a HD TV will upconvert anyway so don't believe the hype of getting stunning near HD from your current DVD's. They all looked exactly the same on my old DVD player and on the upconverting one. I still recommend the player/recorder though because of the price.
5,Great for the Price,"I've recorded over 20 DVDs so far, with no problems. I can use the DVDs in other players, including my iMac. As an upconverting DVD player, it performs well. Load times are quicker than most. The quality is good. Nothing compared to true HD, but they look pretty damn good."
5,Recorder works even better than expected,"Arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Plays .AVIs recorded from internet that many players won't play. Does not record on RAM media, but will play RAM recorded elsewhere. Limited inputs and no tuner did not cause any trouble for me. Also, I use it to record programs from TV without mistakes. Best $60 spent lately."
3,"Great Recorder, so-so player","I got this because I needed a recorder and wanted an upconverting dvd player. I thought that this would be the perfect solution. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the player. I didn't really notice a better picture. Also fastfowarding is rather choppy looking and slow. It's also super slow when loading the dvd. My final complaint is the hdmi hookup, it doesn't give you an option to switch the aspect, meaning if I play/record something that is standard 4:3, it automatically widens the picture to fit the screen, warping the picture. So, anything that is in 4:3 looks off. I had to switch to component hookup. On the bright side the recorder is great, it's fast and the quality is excellent.I plan on returning this to find something that works for my needs."
4,serves basic needs,"I bought this model to replace my several year old Panasonic that took a lightning hit. So far the Toshiba records OK, but only for 2Hrs or less. It can not touch my old Panasonic for clarity! The Panasonic produced outstanding video regardless of the length of a movie. Panasonics ""flexible recording mode"" made use of the entire DVD disk recording at the highest bit rate to fit the exact length of the movie - thereby offering the best picture possible. A movie 2Hr and 12Min would be timed perfectly at the highest bit rate so as to use the full disk capacity. Unfortunately, the Toshiba produces poor picture quality to record a 2Hr and 12Min movie because you are forced to record in LP 4Hr mode wasting half the disk. I could not choose Panasonic at this time due to the poor ratings of their new models and wonder is they even offer the flex time recording feature on the new models."
2,Needs Improvement,"This item could be a lot better. It chaffs my ankles and even leaves marks, every time I wear these. I wish the inside lining was somehow softer so it could be much more comfortable to use. Also, when I use these with my Aqua Aerobic shoes, these weights keep pushing my shoes off my feet, pressing at the heels -- I wish there was a way I could keep my shoes on while wearing these weights. Othersie it is a good product, only if it was a little more comfortable to wear."
4,Love them!,I have had my ankle weights for aboutna month and work out almost every day with them. I think they are easy to put on and are comfortable.
5,great product,Product is very well made. I really like the idea of removable/adjustable weights. Easy to get on and off. Great product!! Would definitely recommend it
5,5 Lb Swim Ankle Weights,Very good product very easy too use especially with arthritic hands. Material is very easy too keep clean and dries very fast.
3,ankle weights,"adds some drag and will slow you down and make you work harder doing laps. However the fit is not too hot. They seem to rub the top of the foot no matter how they are worn, and if you are doing a freestyle kick, they need to be kinda tight to avoid moving around too much."
5,Terrific addition to water workout,"These ankle weights for water exercise are comfortable and definitely add to the workout. An excellent feature is that the amount of weight you can carry is modular: there are four slots on each side of each ankle-band, and you can utilize either no weights, or 1, 2,3, or 4 in each side. Manufacturer recommends starting with none, then adding 1 at a time... Good insructions, simple to use, and I liked the construction."
2,"Good product, bad quality control","I decided to buy these ankle water weights based on the other good reviews. However, the weights I received are of a totally different size. It looks like one is for the wrists and another for the ankles. The material also varies slightly. At least the weight is the same on both (I checked it on a weight). However they feel weird on my ankles, one bigger than the other. The only reason for which I do not return them is because I am abroad; it would cost a lot to send them back (given the weight) and I would have to wait a long time to receive a replacement. For the price they charge ($35 plus almost $10 s/h), I cannot believe that the seller (Fogdog) would be as careless as to not check what is being packed in the boxes and sent to clients. Very disappointed. Other than this, I guess the weights work fine."
4,Better than the rest..,"As a AEA Certified Aquatic Specialist, I was given the task to research and recommend ankle weights and web gloves. It didn't take long for me see why Aqua Power weights were the best for my clients. Features we liked: (1) no metal parts (2)clients able to adjust weights from 2.5 to .5 (3) inside material is soft and no chafing (4) forms to the ankle, heel and top of foot (5) Easy on and off (6)weight logs rest securely in pockets with additional covering. THANKS Amazon for the BEST price and Aqua Pro for taking my Shallow & Deep Water classes to a whole new level. :-)"
5,G Gundam,"First of, I would like to say that Gundam still remains the top Mecha Anime around, and will stay so for a LONG time. Well, I've seen every episode of G Gundam up to now, and I have to say that it is a great Gundam series. A lot like Gundam Wing, it is set in an alternate universe, where a tournament is held every year to see which Gundam is strongest. First off, the storyline is good, the action is good and frequent, and the animation, like Gundam Wing. A lot. Well, I will get this DVD when it comes out, and I know I will enjoy it. 5 out of 5."
5,"isn`t the best,but its on.","...Well this kinda isn`t like all of the rest of gundam series.Every four years or so,the colonieshave a gundam of gundams tournament.The last nation`s gundam that`s standing in the end will win.The series is based on NeoJapan`s fighter, Domon Kasshu.Domon pilots the Shining Gundam,Along with his crewmember,Rein Mikamora.The reason Domon has ent-ered the tournament is to get revenge on his brother Kioji.Kiojipilots the Dark Gundam,A powerful gundam,but I don`t want to spoil it.One other thing that I forgot to mention is that YOU arethe gundam.So basically that means if one your gundam arms getcut off(your arm doesn`t get cut off)you feel the pain.Same withyour leg,etc.And it`s all because of this suit you have to put onBut if your head gets cut off,you don`t feel the pain(thank good-ness),but you lose the match.The dubbing from Japanese to American isn`t all that great,but the fighting is right on.Rated 7 and up:cartoon violence.READY?!....GGGOOO!!!"
2,Thin glass,I bought this product and was unhappy with how thin the glass was. One came broken and two others broke trying to remove the tape. I am a glass artist and have maid thousands of oil candles and thought that i would give these a try. I regret it. do yourself a favor and try to find some other product.
3,Not Too Pleased,This product was not as good as I expected. The wick does not burn bright like the other wicks. Just not as pleased as I thought I would be.
2,Tiny flame,"I bought these to go into a small port bottle which is only about 8"" high (less than the average wine bottle). I half filled the bottle with lamp oil and lit the wick. Within 10 seconds the flame was barely visible. The wick cannot pull lamp oil up fast enough to maintain a flame even 1/2"" high. On a regular wine bottle I doubt it could maintain any flame at all.All in all this was a complete waste of money."
3,Too gag gift,"This is a little hard for me to rate as I'm not a golfer and it was a gift for a coworker, however, the gift was appreciated.The ball, if placed beside a real golf ball, does not look the same, but it's still a nice gag gift.It definitely does not roll straight!! :-)"
3,"Shallow, but satisfying","Rupert vs. Ted! Ted vs. Rupert! Great, easy to read narrative of the most modern media battle. If you want to know about the ideology and shenanigans behind Mr. Fair & BalancedTM, this is the book."
2,i don't like,it's very big!!!! is totally diferent to the picture! i don't like it. looks very current
3,"MEDIOCRE WRITING, GREAT ART","As most fans know, this team produced a (justly) critically acclaimed ""Master of Kung Fu"" comic in the 70's. Too bad their legacy regarding Shang-Chi is tarnished by this tale.While Gulacy's art is dependably excellent, Moench's plot and scripting are hackneyed. The fights seem forced and endless. Do these stories need action and conflict? Sure. Was this the way to do it? No. You'll want to take a pass on this one unless you're a real disciple of Gulacy."
1,Solo Ops,This book was more negative than I expected. I only read a few chapters before I had to sit it down. It was not very helpful at all.
1,Just Plain AWFUL!,"Luckily for me I did'nt Buy this with my Own Money, My Friend did and she was so disappointed with it and after hearing what she had to say about it I skimmed through. This Book is just plain Awful! Military Life is Nothing like how she explains it.Hilary you must be one sad Miserable Girl, who just plain don't like herself or her life!This Book deserve a Negative 10 Stars!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A must for any new military wife,"I admit to having only read excerpts of this book, but it is great. The author takes a no-nonsense, tough love, practical and often humorous approach to military life. Unlike many other books designed to help military wives learn about thier new lives this one is written in a more personal stile explaining the things one wife learned and wanted to pass onto others. It is entertaining reading which is more than you can usually say for a manual."
2,NOT such a great book.,"I didn't find this book to be very good or funny or helpful at all. I'm going to have to re-read it. maybe then I will catch the humor. for now, I wouldn't suggest it to any new wives, or you will be depressed throughout your husband's full term. Keep in mind many of the GREAT reviews she has were written by members of her website.I will write my full opinion once I finish it AGAIN."
3,Not all is like she said it is,After 13 years of being a military wife I thought her statements are pretty funny but also a bit cynical. You can't just laugh about problems and shake them off like the Author is suggesting. But she is right - keeping a good attitude helps a lot. I am not quite sure if she really enjoyed her husband being in the military - she is very critical about everything that has to do with being a soldiers wife. But on the other hand I like her being so frank. I really enjoyed reading it but only because I know what she is talking about...a brand new military wife might be on the other hand scared to death after reading this book.
1,Pessimism Abounds Here!!!,"If you want a sarcastic, (read: mean spirited) look behind the scenes of a jaded military wife that seems to dislike the military, then look no further, for you have found the motherlode.The pessimistic tone of this book is very demoralizing, and I can only hope it isn't being sold in your PX, for surely it would send even the toughest of military wives running for the nearest divorce lawyer.Hilary Martin does the impossible with this book, with her sad attempts at humor dragging the tone of the book even further down into the depths of cranky regret.I am ashamed of this book, and only hope that the outlooks of other mil. wives are more upbeat.Don't buy it. I promise you will regret it.Refunds should be offered on this to every unsuspecting customer that had the utter misfortune to actually pay for it.(note: I only gave it one star because the Amazon system demands a rating and doesn't have a ""negative star rating"")"
1,Please don't waste your money,"There is not much I can say that the other reviewers did'nt already say. Please don't waste your money, The Military Life is NOT nearly as bad as the Writer lets on. Yes, you run into some problems along the way but that comes with anything not just Military Life. It's all about How you deal with what you are given."
5,Brutally Honest with a Sharp Wit.,"I loved this book. I am not a Military Spouse, but a Soldier in the US Army. I picked this book up at the post library to show my wife, and I couldn't put it down. After eight years of being in the Service, everything she wrote rang so true.She does come off a little pessimistic and bitter sometimes, which I didn't mind at all. Dealing with the Military Establishment will make you pessimistic and bitter.I found the writing very humorous and easy to read.While I wouldn't say that this is the end-all, be-all book for Military Spouses, It will definitely give the prospective, or current spouse an eye-opening glimpse of some of the frustrations, and huge responsibilities that a Military Spouse will have to take on, without any of the optimistic naivete found in many other ""Military Wife Guides""."
1,SORRY I BOUGHT IT,"I bought this book thinking it would offer advice for military wives, because it calls itself a ""survival guide"". In fact, it has little to no information that would help me get through a tough time. If you are looking for a good, supportive book, this is NOT it. I was very disappointed, and will order another wives book in hopes that it will be better written."
4,reviewing not ranting,"What happened to taking things with a grain of salt?I am an Army wife. My husband is an officer, a pilot, and I am not a friend of the author. Of course I have not experienced every single thing the author has. we are all different. I did, however, find her honesty and humor refreshing. Perhaps those who do not understand sarcasm should stay away. for me, it was funny and even helpful, in that I was reminded to laugh more often. the military life can be frustrating. tricare and being treated like a number can be baffling. if you claim to be a military wife who has never experienced such frustrations, then perhaps you are walking with blindfolds on. take them off, look around, it is both frightening and enlightening."
2,Not the best book for new military wives.,"I have read a number of books for military wives and families. While this book was entertaining, it was also very cynical and gave a pessimistic view to military life. Some of the information was fairly accurate, however this book would scare me away from a military lifestyle if I was a new military wife. Some of the more experienced wives may be able to appreciate the humor. Additionally, the author seems fairly young, and there were a number of derogatory remarks made about her husband and men in general (it may be offensive to some readers). It's also one of the most expensive books for military wives available (not sure why). I'd recommend Today's Military Wife by Lydia Sloan Cline over this book anyday."
1,Don't waste your money or time reading this,"I hope she wasn't paid much for this book. I have read several books on the military way of life, and I have to say this was the most rude and typical polyester-patty military wife opinion and outlook. Although she ""claims"" to be a ""professional"" and employed as a pharmacy technician, her entire book paints her as a military wife that EVERYONE has heard about. Yes, those that give the good ones a bad name. This entire book is filled with negativity, and quite a large portion of it I have found to be untrue. Perhaps with her negative attitude these were in fact her experiences, but a polite person could never have so many bad encounters. I wish I had never wasted my money on this book, or the time to read it. I could have been doing something much more enlightening like watching the grass grow!!! Honestly, there are very few true instances in this book. To get a better perspective from an OPEN MIND and a military spouse, buy Married to the Military."
1,I've read more informative nutritional lables,"This book was nothing but a vehicle for Ms. Martin to vent her frustration with the military. Having been both in the military and a military spouse for some time now, I can say with confidence that it certainly takes more than one year of this lifestyle to make a person fit to dole out advice. Ms. Martin would have been better to keep her whining to herself, and produce an objective piece with real advice instead of cynicism."
1,Gripe Session,"My fiancee has always considered the military, but before he committed I wanted to do research about the realities we would face in the military. I have read close to ten books now, and while I am far from an expert on the matter, I can tell you that this is the worst book I have read yet. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it! I have never written a review before, but I was sooooo unimpressed with this book that I felt compelled to warn potential buyers.It wasn't the negativity that turned me off, but how the author used the book as a platform to vent while calling it a ""Survival Guide"". This is not a ""How To"" book nor is it insightful in its advice. Her advice is nothing but sarcasm and while some of the content coincides with other books I have read, it seems to paint a skewed picture that leaves the reader with the wrong impression."
1,"Should be called ""One Woman's Cynical POV on the Military""","This book offers no practical information. In fact in one section she refers to military support groups but then leaves you to find the phone numbers and addresses on your own. I was confused, because the book is very bitter and cynical and yet she keeps saying to keep a sense of humor. Is her sense of humor just mean-spirited? I refuse to believe that the military isn't an experience to keep positive about, but she certainly has a very negative outlook. If I had read this as a new army wife, it would scared me into divorce."
1,A good example of a bad attitude,"I will keep this book on my shelf and gladly recommend it to a very specific group. It's a good example of what a bad attitude can do for you. If you start to think and sound like the author it's time for you to take a good look at what you're doing and why. If indeed your first response to yourself and others is ""suck it up and drive on,"" do us all a favor and ETS. When the only way you can manage your association with the military is to be negative and divisive; you become a liability to the rest of us who clean up the ugly you leave around. When I encounter a spouse with that large of a chip on the shoulder I'll give them a copy of Solo-Ops as an example of what to guard against. Then I'll invite them to be part of the solution, not the problem."
2,Jury is in; my wife hated it,"This was to be one of a few Valentines presents. It's truly a tight choker and I doubt my wife will like it. It also has a smudge on the front observable surface that may come off with a cleaner. I'll wait and see if she likes it. I'll amend this if it works out. It's certainly easy to put on, but it seems too wide and not ""long"" enough to fit well around high neck sweater. The product description didn't say how long it is, and ""choker"" more adequately describes this than ""necklace"" as it is advertised. Roughly measuring it, it is about 15-16"" with a 2"" gap at the top.UPDATE: returned it b/c it was such an awkward fit and b/c she didn't like it enough to put up with something that fits poorly on her....and she has a thin neck."
1,doesn'e lay flat and hurts my neck,"I actually bought it form my mother in law, who has a bit of a thicker neck. It looked awful on her, so I decided to keep it and was not happy with it at all."
5,elegant and solid,"It's very simple and elegant, just something I have been looking for. There are some smears on the surface, but I guess those can be easily cleaned. It looks great by itself or with a pendant, very easy to put on or take off."
4,Solid reading.,"The Great Cloud of Witnesses will make more sense as you read Bullinger's book. He advocates the two kingdoms theory which you may or may not buy into, but either way it is a great primer on the meaning of this area of Hebrews which ties together the whole Bible around Faith."
5,Review,"I bought ALL the lost episodes, and all the 39 classics, and in my humble opinion, the lost episodes are even funnier than the original 39. More spontaneous, raw, boisterous. Really a whole bunch of gems in here and only a few stinkers. I did not grow up watching the originals, discovered the 39 and the Lost episodes about the same time, maybe that has something to do with it, I have not been indoctrinated into the 39 as being automatically the best. But anyway the two are both sides of one gold coin so get them ALL!"
3,OK,"The quality is right there. I am sorry to say that I watched quite a bit of the episodes and they don't hold up like most of the ealry TV shows I have watched. But they are entertaing in that it's fun to see the clothes, styles, offices, cars, etc of that era. All in all I would say buy this if you want to be midly entertained."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I had never seen or heard of this show before purchasing it. Just bought it to see an old show. The direction by Allen H. Minor in these shows is excellent, more of movie quality. Definitely a surprise for 1959 television. James Gregory is good here in the main role. I like the sepia and white, myself, but that is a matter of taste. It is pretty cool to see current, well-known (old) guest actors in their youth, (Harry)Dean Stanton, Burt Reynolds, etc. There are some actresses who I have never heard of giving some very good performances here as well, as various hard-boiled dames, molls, and so on. Particularly at the reduced price, this was a very good purchase. No complaints whatsoever."
3,poor quality,the stories were entertaining.the problem was the quality of the tape. it got stuck at times and I could not finish a few episodes
3,shipping too high,The product is fine but with the price of shipping if I had thought more about it I would have just gone to the store and bought a whole new set of bottles. I wouldn't buy these again.
2,"THIS IS QUITE A DIFFERENT MOVIE, BUT A TREAT TO BE SURE!!!","THIS IS QUITE A DIFFERENT MOVIE, BUT A TREAT TO BE SURE!!! It contains everything that makes movies enjoyable...almost. That is why I'd consider giving it 4 stars. The characters are entertaining enough. But the island locale which promised to be a delight, turned out to be a BUST. Sure, I can overlook the bad special effects... Rent this, if you are looking for an old-fashioned horror show, with a wildly modern twist, look no further. If you don't understand its ""R"" rating, just watch (or rather listen) to the scene at the beginning, and then you'll understand why. Oh, Kathryn Witt's character of the scientist was just annoying and proved to appear in the most boring scenes. Oh, and the ending, what a disaster! Maybe if WB went back and retook a new ending and then re-released this, they would have better luck. In the meantime, you'll just have to make do with a VHS or maybe DVD if one comes out..."
5,Fabulous book for my 3 year old,"I was originally turned on to this book because The Children's Theatre in Minneapolis had a short play based on ""Where is the Green Sheep?"" It is a fabulous book -- very catchy phrasing and cute pictures. My daughter loves to ""read"" it now that she has it memorized."
5,Love this book!,"I can't count how many times we've read this book. My older daugther (5) has it memorized and ""reads"" it to her little sister (2). The drawings are sweet and whimsical. The repetition of ""But where is the green sheep"" makes them both giggle. One of our all time favorites!"
3,"Easy Read, Possible Boredom","This book is certainly an easy enough read for an advanced 3 yr old, but could also be easily boring. Not much excitement or surprise from page to page to keep an active child with a creative imagination occupied for very long."
3,I don't care `sheep'...,"I don't really get this book. The whimsical illustrations aside, I found myself not really caring about that elusive green sheep; like at all. Sure, this is not a book for me, but for my daughter, but still...I failed to see the point. The types of sheep presented range from colorful sheep to `bed sheep' (why not `sleepy sheep') and `scared sheep', and everything in between `sheep', but when we finally find that green sheep it isn't anything wonderful or exciting. I kind of expected the sheep to be hidden throughout the book, or to have his reveal be something fun but in the end he's just...sleeping behind a bush. Oh well, like I mentioned, the illustrations are pretty darn cute and the comparisons between opposites made (but never enforced) could help children to learn and put things together for themselves, but the overall impression I get of this book is rather apathetic. There are plenty of better written children's books to choose from."
3,small book,"I love the book Ten Little Fingers and Ten Little Toes by Mem Fox, so I bought this book. It is very small and the illustrations aren't very good. So far it has not captured my son's attention like her other book."
5,Music Music,"Her playing is really nice, I do not fault her performances but, the video work was lousy but not lousy enough to spoil the enjoyment of having this in my collection... I do encourage anyone to buy this DVD..."
3,Hat is just OK,"The hat seems to be well made, but I don't use it too much to test that. Mostly because it looks awkward on me. The way it is shaped/its size make it look funny when worn. It covers my ears and doesn't look too ridiculous, so it will get some use when it's cold. But, I don't really like to wear it."
3,Try Your Luck,"What I liked about this pair of earrings is the light-weight. Due to the nature of corals, the individual pieces vary in color, texture, and size. The jeweler made a good attempt to piece together corals to ensure homogeneity for each pair of earrings. I ordered my first pair and realized that there was a very noticeable dark spot on one of the coral pieces. So I ordered another set. This set did not have any dark spots, but the coloring was not as deep as the first set. Therefore, I ended up returning both pairs because I felt like I did not receive the great value for the price like I usually do from Amazon."
3,Earings,"Well, these weren't as ""gorgeous"" as portrayed. I don't feel they were worth the price at all. I would say they are pretty at best."
2,I'm not sure the color is natural,"Please pay attention to description that gem. It is stated that ""Gemstones may have been treated to improve their appearance or durability ""..And this statement is a warning sign that coral may be not in its natural color. I have bad experiences buying in Dillard's big coral bracelet for 60 dollars and that bracelet started coloring my skin in red and over weeks losing red color. All that happened because it is a common practice to color coral ""to improve their appearance"". The real red coral may cost well above one thousand dollars and just for very small piece."
5,Interesting angle,"As said here before: good angle to take, to attempt to explain the greatest mystery of the Nazi era: how society allowed this to happen. Evans shows clearly how it was not the Nazis, but the nationalist mindset that allowed the events.I am probably not the only reader to see potential danger today: the red threads of disdain for democracy, flag-waving nationalism, love of authoritarian government and easy acceptance of loss of civil liberties runs right through Germany up to 1945, and the parallels with today's trends are somewhat worrying - even the rhetoric is the same (homeland security, anyone?).Michael"
5,The Third Reich by Evans,The book is the first in a series of 3 about the rise and fall of the Third Reich. The book was well written and well researched. It is one of many books on this topic but i found it to be better than most of the books covering this topic. It provides interesting information and represents the results of very good and thorough research.
3,Not exactly gripping,"It is possible to write history, even about a complex subject, in a way that truly involves the reader. Margaret Macmillan's ""Paris 1919"" is an excellent example. That is not the case with ""The Coming of the Third Reich"". In fact, it's a bit of a struggle to read at some points. The author seems to prefer lists to analysis, and uses a strange narrative approach. I would spend my money on Kershaw's ""Hitler"" over this."
1,Nothing New Here,"There's really nothing new here to grab the senses. As an historian of the Third Reich I expected alot more of the first of a three volume set. Boring, tedious and certainly nothing new!And what's with the cover? The book is about the Third Reich but German Communist Party members are featured on the cover!! ????"
2,A different point of view....,"I can't and won't question the other (overwhelmingly positive) reviews here. The book is without doubt well researched, readable, and very detailed. Having said that, I found it a dry read, and had to force myself to get through it. Unlike other reviewers, I have not read extensively on World War II. Evans constantly assumes a certain knowledge of German history that I lacked, and I found myself frequently looking on Wikipedia to fill gaps in my knowledge. Even still, I found the book bogged down in details and struggled to find the main themes. Perhaps if I were already well read on this topic I would have felt some of the enthusiasm others have expressed. Not for beginners."
2,"Sensible, average, but not innovative.","I'm not sure I got value for money when I bought this book. It provides a sensible and fairly exhaustive overview of the rise of the Nazis. But I'm also disappointed. The book contains nothing unique or original. In terms of fact and interpretation it is safe and conforming, and devoid of originality.Perhaps my standards are unrealistic, or maybe my expectation of a book by Professor Evans, a distinguished academic at Cambridge University, was too high. Either way I don't rate this book as a lofty contribution. It lacks the penetrating analytical touch of Michael Burleigh's similar but better work, and as the first work of a trilogy does not inspire me to think about buying the next two volumes."
5,Very good book,"I have read many books on WW2, and this one is very concise and does a good job of explaining the pre-history of the Third Reich. I would definitly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in Nazi history."
2,"Sensible, average, but not innovative.","I'm pleased I bought this book. It provides a sensible and fairly exhaustive overview of the rise of the Nazis. But I'm also disappointed.

It lacks the penetrating analytical touch of Michael Burleigh's similar but better work, and as the first work of a trilogy does not inspire me to think about buying the next two volumes."
2,Not as good as I expected.,"This book seems to be polarizing readers, with some seeing it as an excellent overview and others seeing it as merely another safe and conventional narrative. I'm sorry to say that, despite respect for Professor Evans and his abilities, I'm one of the latter. This is not a very good book. It says nothing unique, takes no risks, and seems agenda-driven. It?s generally readable, although sometimes clogged by detail and extraneous information, and is probably accurate so far as I can tell. But it is such a conventional and non-original work that I can?t see how it can find a niche. Burleigh and others have simply done the job better."
1,WAITING FOR YEARS,"I am truly disappointed with this author. I talked to the author on several occasions about the upcoming new edition in 2006. Now this edition is being offered for $100. Mrs. Mitchell, I do believe you are an expert in helping African American students get into law school, but this is a complete disappointed. With e-books being a convenient & easy way to publish a book, I would think you could update and publish quickly. i hope you update this book soon. i would love to get the opportunity to use it to apply to law school."
4,"Insightful, candid. A Work of Art for the African American","This has to be apart of your library!!! This is a must read for the African-American Pre-Law Student. This book provides insightful information that most books on the market lack from the African-American perspective. It provided just what is needed for the successful matriculation into law school. What was of particular interest to me where her comments for those students that are products of a historically black university or college. This book was easy to understand and follow and gave a very candid view of the entire admissions process. What I would have like to see were profiles of students that also went throught the admissions process and have been admitted into law schools, to get their insights as well, in addition, to seeing actual sucessful submitted copies of students personal essays, and a couple of comments from persons that sit on the admissions committee panel. Overall, Evangeline hit it on the mark!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,So you want to go to law school?,"Are you an African American with dreams of law school? If so, it is highly recommended that you read The African American Pre-Law School Advice Guide by Evangeline M. Mitchell, J.D. Ms. Mitchell poses important questions and situations that will help contribute to your decision as to whether law school is the place for you.Each chapter of this book breaks down the pre-law and the law school experience. It breaks myths and gives you a laundry list of things that the prospective law student will need to consider. Such as the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT), financial aid and beyond. Overall, this is a very helpful book, and I believe that the author developed it so that she can help people to make an informed decision whether or not to attend law school. Also, the questions that are posed to the reader can actually be used in making decisions about college or graduate school.Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks"
4,works,"Works as advertised. I'm sure this is the type of product that is included when you buy the sprinkler heads, but I didn't have one and could not locate locally."
5,Hunter sprinkler tool,This product is everything it needs to be. It is study enough to do the job and looks like it will last for a long time with little or no care
5,Excellent tool,I purchased this tool and it has done exactly as promised! I was able to adjust my sprinkler heads quickly and easily.
4,Worth it,I needed the adjustment tool for the in ground watering system I have. The previous owners didn't leave one around. These worked great in making the minor adjustments that were needed.Just what I was looking for and a price that was right.
1,not real helpful,Book is old. not that helpful. I will have to find other sources for jobs when i am ready to move to europe.
3,Unknown outcome,"I received my Service Plan without a hitch, but I can't really review how well it will work until my camera has a problem...so I am hoping not to ever be able to give a definative review."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PLAN!!!!,"This company misrepresents themselves on their amazon page claiming ""if it breaks we fix it"" well my camera is broken, and they are not going to fix it.They make false claims that say certain things are covered when they are not.Rude ""customer service"" representatives who are not interested in helping you or solving your problems.WHAT YOU SEE IS NOT WHAT YOU GET!!!!BEWARE!!!"
2,Should have listen to the reviews,"I wanted to protect myself with buying such an expensive camera. I read all the reviews about this service plan, the good and the bad, and bought this anyway. Come to find out I haven't received the piece of paper they promised to send like 2 weeks after purchase....I'm still waiting!!"
1,Think about your credit card protection before buying!,"Most credit cards (Amex, Visa) offer loss and damage protection, and extended warranty protection. Amex, for example, doubles the manufacturer's warranty up to and for at least 1 year.Research your credit card benefits before investing 20-25% of the product cost in extended warranty protection. I think it's worthless."
1,Wishful thinking,4-Year Service Plan for Digital and Film Cameras $200 to $599.99I would really hope Amazon.com will consider upgrading their choice of company in regards to choosing a more improved Service Plan. I was definitely considering purchasing this 4 year service plan until I realized it does not cover the most important thing for me which is accidental damage. I understand accidents do happen and for me purchasing a service plan that would cover this kind of issue is a plus for my investment.
4,have no chance to use it yet.,"I don't like the warranty policy, because it does not cover physical damage."
1,strange warranty withine one year I have conduct manufacture,I did not satisfied their warranty because within one year My camera lens cover does not work so I call them they said their warranty as the same as manufacture warranty so I have to call manufacture canon. their warranty start after manufacture end and I have paid for shipping to Cannon repair center.do not recommended
1,False advertising,"This plan ONLY covers mecanical and electrical failures. It DOES NOT cover ""normal wear and tear"" as stated in the table. I called the company and they say it does not cover normal wear and tear. Now I get to wait 8-10 weeks for a check instead of an instant refund.... Bad deal!"
1,Big rip off,"The Web page says it covers everything but when you read the ""Terms and Conditions"" it only covers Manufacurer defects I called the NEW Customer service and asked why and they hung up on me. Tried to report it to amazon but they did not seem too interested. I would not touch these warrentys with a ten foot pole !!!"
1,extended warrentee,After reading the tearms of the contract and comparing them to the factory warrentee I found the service plan contract was vertully usless and canceled it
1,"bad idea to ""deliver"" product warranty 3 months earlier than product","I bought a camera but cancelled the order after ten days, when I saw that it was still 3 months out on being delivered. However, I am having difficulty getting the warranty canceled through another vendor.Why must a warranty start before the product is delivered?Why can this warranty not be easily canceled?"
3,"Outdoor Torch Kit-20,000 BTU","Torch works fairly well for removing dead weeds and grass in small areas. Found it somewhat difficult to keep it lit. Has a sparker in the gas tube which helps, but for some reason, it stops burning frequentlyOutdoor Torch Kit - 20,000 BTU"
2,Outdoor torch,"I purchased this outdoor torch to help with my blackberry problem in some land I had cleared this summer without resorting to chemicals. The ""cane"" handle and igniter work well and make it very easy to use, but it did not remove any of the young blackberry plants. Steamed or burned the leaves and stocks but they grew back shortly."
4,Good Product,Does the job -- easy to use -- simpler than i thought -- no complaints -- just screw on a bottle of propane from the grocery store and get the job done. Automatic clicker works great.
3,MAPP Gas Only,The torch works fine as advertized. They do not tell you that this model is for MAPP gas. I like to use the converter hose and run mine from a 20lb propane tank. That is not possible with this model. The Mapp gas is hotter than propane and cost a lot more. If you do any volume with this torch you will spend a lot of money on gas.
3,"Good, but I prefer the ones that fit the larger 20 lb (gas grill) tanks","I wish they had a hookup for 20lb grill tanks like the larger Red Dragon vt-2-23 C. It would save me a TON of money not having to reuse the small ones each time. If you spend the extra 12$ on one that hooks up to a larger tank, it will pay for itself in no time."
3,Works... but not really sufficient for my needs.,"Bought this to weed some hard landscaping I just put in... it works, is good quality, and would be entirely sufficient for applications smaller than mine... Like getting the weeds out of the cracks of your driveway instead of dousing them in Round Up. Also completely satisfactory for things like starting fires, etc. It just doesn't have the ompf I need to keep up with the 3000 square feet of new landscaping I have to keep up with."
1,Flame out,"I was very happy with the burner when I got it. It's done a fine job, until today. I've used the igniter about 50 times, and today it stopped working. All the other reviews seemed to be good when I bought it, so I'm hoping this is an anomaly and the company will make things right. I've contacted them via email, and I'll update this review when I have news to share.Well, no response from Bernzomatic, and the 30 day warranty period from Amazon is over, so I have no recourse. To be fair, it worked for 3 months. I don't think that's long enough for something like this. The unit is durable overall, but the igniter is flimsy and cheap.I finally got a response from customer support. They said they would send me a replacement. Several months later, and no replacement. Don't buy from this company. They don't stand behind their product."
4,Love It!,I use this tool to get rid of weeds between the pavers in my walkway and steps. It works really well. It does a great job and is easy to use (I find it kind of fun).I would have given this product a 5 star rating except that I found the description misleading and thought the fuel tank was included ... it is not.
4,Weed Torch,"Nice tool for the price. Kills out all weeds with little fuel. The tanks last for quit a long time. I suppose a more expensive unit would be a bit more efficiant. However for the price, ya can't beat it. Next year I'll get started a little sooner before the weeds get too far outa hand."
2,Poor product support,"I liked the concept, but when the apparatus failed to ignite after short use Benzomatic Customer Service was of little help in resolving the problem. The individual contacted kept saying it could not be the igniter, and offered no other assistance. It still doesn't work because it won't ignite."
1,"igniter wears our; not replaceable, junk the whole thing -- dang!","(...) lists their Frequently Answered Questions about this product:* Can I replace the igniter on my torch?No. We do not recommend that users replace igniters.* Do you sell replacement igniters?No. We do not recommend that users replace igniters.Well duh. I guess everybody asks this after a year or maybe two if you don't use it very much.The little sparker thing is bound to wear out a lot faster than the big metal valve and burner.But it all goes into the landfill.Sheesh. Ronson could do a better job of this, at least you can replace their dang flints.These piezoelectric sparkers ought to cost about (...). Off to search the Chinese websites (sigh)"
5,"Bernzomatic 19425 JT850 Self-Igniting 20,000 BTU Outdoor Torch","Excellent product. Eliminates weeds if used as directed. Use care in preventing fires.Suggestions: Wilt, do not burn, the weeds. Large weeds require multiple (2x or 3x), weekly, wilting. Beats poisons on so many levels.Works well for spot weeding. Larger burners might be needed for very large areas."
3,"Well Balanced, Good Heat","Understand and Enjoy how this device is supposed to work. Been easy, if a little slow to weed using the torch. Usually takes two passes, one to wilt the plant then next day or so one to actually burn it. Negative feature is the PIZO igniter, after 4 bottles of gas and about 50+ uses of the ignitor it has become unreliable, so will have to get a standard striker and layout of the unit will make this a pain."
5,Easy to use mini weed burner,"Great for burning small weeds, in between patio stones, along the edge of walkways.It is light and the self igniting button is very easy to reach and use. Outstandinglittle tool and safe for the environment."
4,Works as Described,"We bought this torch for burning weeds around our residence and for lighting campfires. It works as described, and we are satisfied with it. The torch can use either propane or Mapp gas - which was not clear from the Amazon web site description. Also, the torch would be more convenient if the ignition button was at the top of the handle along the lines of other self-igniting Bernzomatic torches. Overall a good purchase."
2,small flame...for small jobs only,"This is for the homeowner who has more of a small nuisance weed problem, IE: weeds/grass between walkways, some in driveways....etc. If you have large weeds & weedy areas, definitely step it up w/ the Weed Dragon.Although easy to use & handle, and ignitor is convenient, it didn't quite do the job I expected."
5,Lightening quick speedy delivery!,"Great product,we use it to light our smoker and it works perfectly. We have since seen it at the store for a lot more money. Excellent service, it arrived in 2 days."
4,Bernzomatic Outdoor Torch - for weeds,"Works as advertised. Very happy with results. Hint, spray with a weed killer first to dry out the weeds, then use the torch to avoid the back breaking weeding."
3,Outdoor torch kit,"Item works great, easy to use, lightweight. Only problem is that it takes a long time to actually kill and burn up the weeds."
5,"Outdoor Torch Kit - 20,000 BTU",This is the best hand held torch on the market. I bit pricey but in the long run worth it
4,Flame Weeding Rocks!,"I purchased this item to kill weeds in an overgrown stone-covered bed in my front yard without damaging the trees & shrubs in the area. The igniter worked fine and it was easy to target what I was burning. The small propane tank (purchased separately) was more than enough to cover an area roughly 20 x 10 feet. It did take a bit longer than I expected to burn some of the plants. It was a bit windy the day I used it and I had to relight often, usually I could do this just by pointing it at a place where weeds were still smoldering rather than use the igniter. Spring will tell as to whether the burnt plants will make a comeback!"
2,broke in just 2 months,"Initially this was a wonderful tool to burn out weeds.However after using it briefly, maybe 20 minutes, on a weekly basis for 2 months, the self ignition broke and it will no longer light without an outside source of flame.So given that knowledge, plus the fact that it is no longer covered by Amazon after 30 days, I would not recommend this item."
3,Bernzomatic Self Inginting outdoor Torch,The idea is a good one but the self ingiting does not work. The product is OK but it takes a long time just to burn one weed in the driveway. Will probably go back to Roundup.
3,Overall not a bad weeding machine,"I'm not quite sure what I was expecting this torch to do for me in the way of weeding our yard, which is the primary reason I bought one. I suppose I envisioned it instantly torching away weeds of all sizes.Overall it gets the job done but it does take some concentrated effort to burn up your average sized weeds. The trigger start works quickly and effortlessly. The torch is very easy to use and is the right length for tackling the job w/o having to bend over at all. Which is good because you do have to hold the flame on weeds for several seconds to burn them up. For touch-up jobs around the yard it's fine, but if you have significant weed problems I recommend going with a spray solution if possible. It will burn nearly any weed given enough time, just doesn't turn them to ash quite as quickly as I expected or hoped it would."
2,Outdoor Torch,"This item is only effective on certain types of weeds. The ignition on this model did not work, and lighting the torch is difficult."
3,Bernzomatic User,"I will kill weeds and is okay for spot weeding but to small for serious work. I think something in the order of 100,000 BTU would be better. If conditions are dry you could get in real trouble. Use with caution and have a water hose near by. A fire watch person is recommended."
4,Pleased with the product!,"The price was right, the product arrived quickly and it does exactly what it is advertised to do. What more could you ask for.Bernzomatic 19425 JT850 Self-Igniting 20,000 BTU Outdoor Torch"
4,Worth the money,"I am happy with this torch, it's easy to light and destroys weeds quickly. I would purchase this again and recomend it for people with small jobs."
3,Benzomatic 20k BTU outdoor torch,"Shipping and packaging was good. The torch works fine, but the ignitor does not work... I noticed other people had the same complaint. Keep a lighter or matches handy when using this torch."
3,Enjoyable except for the horrible editing,"The book itself was pretty good. The characters were well thought-out, and there was a lot of action...but the bad editing was very distracting, and the ending seemed forced, like the author was tired of writing."
1,The Bone Orchard,I got bored with this book from the very beginning. I guess it just wasn't my type of book. Sorry.
1,NOT READ,I HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK. I'M HOPING TO READ #1 PRIOR TO READING THIS ONE. I'LL BE HAPPY TO REVIEW IT AT THAT TIME.THANKS FOR ASKING
3,Picks up Towards the End,"Although the setting was intriguing and characters believeable, I felt the story was cumbersome and didn't really start to flow until the later chapters. Mac is a very likeable dectective and well drawn out but the story does not move forward easily and did get frustrating because it wasn't moving forward fast enougth. The author did live in the area which made me want to finish the book because the setting and economic climate was on point. I do think the second book will have a better flow, but this book is not an easy read, particularly if you like to read crime books like Patterson and Cornwall."
2,Gripping story; loser protagonist,"Good first book (in places), but the writer made the protagonist such a loser that I found my self disappointed at the end. That's it? Mac has lots of life skills, but settles for a dismal end, waiting to die?Also, I suggest more research for the next novel. No one who has several broken ribs could do the things that Mac did in the last 100 pages."
1,Forget About It,"This game isn't coming out. Its been delayed and delayed and delayed again. It was supposed to come out last chrismas, then got postponed to about the end of Febuary, then to the beginning of June, and now practicly the end of July. I wouldn't be surprized if they just cancel the game entirely."
2,nooo way,"this game is not bad.. but it is nowhere near the worth of its price, and why would you buy this game when you can buy other, better games?"
2,"Great game, bad testing.","Any time a strategy game comes out with as many complexities as Settlers IV, you have to applaud the imagination and thought that inspired the creation of such a game. However, when you can't play this game because of incessant crashing, needs for multiple patches, and a latent fear to play because you're not sure if the save function is working today, you put that game back on the shelf, and wait for the game producers to come out with a working game. Did I mention one of their patches needed a patch? That's a first for me, a patch to get the patch to work, think about that for a moment, and contemplate the frustration you'll feel, and the time you'll waste. Save your money."
3,Fun but crashes often,"The crashes always seem to happen at the worst moment. I haven't downloaded any fixes so maybe this is already fixed. Rather simple game but amazingly fun. Battle is too simple and trying to get your soldiers to do what you ask is impossible. They will not retreat when you try to get them too. The thieves are even worse. They'll walk up to foreign soldiers to commit suicide. And, there's no such thing as repeat. I sent them to steal an opponents gold and it's not like they went back until the supply was gone. No, they walked across the border and waited for the foreign soldiers to get rid of them. Yuck!"
5,"Great game, if u like realtime Strategy",Fantastic game. A must if like realtime Strategy games. More based on economy than settlers 3. Well worth it tho. Online gaming can be a bit laggy at times but still cool. One player mode is great quite a challenge. Plenty of updates once you've acomplished first goalsgood buy :)
4,Good Game,"Settlers IV is a bit slow to get into and no where near as fast paced as more popular RTS's, but I do like how detailed it is in setting up and building your settlements. Once you finally get your economy well established (which can take the better part of an hour at times) then you do go out for conquest and battle. Nothing epic but I enjoy it especially considering I work with young people and finding quality e-rated RTS games they can play at my center is a bit challenging. Basically if your looking for an intense RTS where you don't really have time to stop and think then avoid this game, but if you like taking the time to develop a settlement and establish a strong economy before heading out to conquer the map then you'll love this game."
2,Suffers terribly from poor production quality.,"Robert ""Bilbo"" Walker has real raw talent but it is hidden by the rotten sound quality of this CD. It is actually painful to my ears to listen to his music at moderate volume level and more than once I've wanted to sling this CD out the window in disgust while driving but I hate to part with the almost $20.00 I paid for it. Unless you are desperate, save your money."
2,"good, if you like battery acid!","This works great! I was able to record. I put the battery in and it worked. Then, I tried to plug it in to transfer music. I go into the folder, and then I hear a squelching noise coming from the player. I open up the batter compartment for a suprise. The battery was leaking battery acid! I cleaned the compartment out, and tried again. Same thing! Then I plugged it in with no battery. No suprises! It actually worked! But then, It made me format. I liked it. I just didn't like the fact of having a pH 1 acid in my MP3 player with no warning!"
2,You get what you pay for,This item is not bad for the price. I should have realized that mp3 players are still expensive for the technology. I wish that I would have just spent another $25.00 and recieved some thing nicer. The player is difficult to import music to and goes through batteries very quickly. I would not purchase this item again if I had it to do all over.
3,FM tuner SUCKs,"I bought this in January, as soon as i opened the package my expectations were dashed to the floor, the thing looked useless, with ony 3 buttons, and a joystick. non said on. It took me days to figure out how to turn it on. then some time to figure out how to acess all the modes with one joy sick. i have to say, the features were more than i expected. the earphone cord is reallllly sort. The volume down is not working properly, I have yet to pick up a station on the fm tuner. I guess i got waht i paid for. aint wort it to try to return it."
3,Capacitor was molded and leaking,"GREAT, true zero gauge wires. However, the kit I received contained and old capacitor THAT WAS LEAKING ACID. Good thing my JL 1000/1 has a built in capacitor, or I would have been pissed. This product would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't for the leaking capacitor. You can tell it'd been sitting in their warehouse for a good 12+ years. I'm sure this doesn't happen all the time though, so I do recommend it!"
1,Wrong Title still........ not a MBTX but a MATX !!! beware..,"I got 4 of these cases. Turned out to be the wrong type. They are MATX not MBTX. Got them picked up back to the supplier, received a message that the title was wrong. As of now seems all was changed was the right image but not the title !!!"
1,If only there were a zero star rating,"Is evident from reading this book that woprking in Mr. Weber's firm must be like working in one of the rings of Hell. This ""book"" is marked by self-indulgence, triviality, and a decadent smugness that speaks volumes. When he isn't rehashing Peteresque ""turn leadership on it's head"" foolishness, he's condescending to all of the ""younger generation"" folks. Save your money for the next Patty Seybold book. At least she has a novel idea once every 20 years."
4,Pretty good,"I've had the game for about half an hour, and I can already tell this is going to be one of my favourites. How to describe it... imagine crossing Dungeon Keeper and Starcraft, then giving it a 3d interface that shames most other games. The graphics are wonderful, and they even look good on my now outdated Voodoo 2. I can't wait until I get my christmas bonus and can see what they look like with a Geforce Ultra. The storyline is quite imaginitive, the characters are funny (though I didn't know Stratos was Tim Curry at first), the sound is great. The gameplay takes a little work to get into the flow of, but the tutorials really help. My only problem so far is that the user interface leaves a bit to be desired. Spellcasting is ok, but not very speedy (I'm sure I haven't found the quick keys yet), and it's often hard to select your minions, but other than that, this game gets my full recommendation."
2,"All glitter, no gold","At first this game is jawdropping. Beautiful graphics, a fast engine, original ideas and a unique premise. After playing through a few games, however, one quickly comes to realize that every session is essentially the same. There is little variation from mission to mission in the actual gameplay and it rapidly becomes a very repetitive experience."
5,Begin your adventure of Myth and Magic,"This game, Sacrifice, has the most realistic graphics seen on games today. Designed by the leading graphic coordenaters of interplay productions this game is worth its price."
4,"Great, but not perfect","This game is great. It breaks the mold of normal RTS games - you are on the battlefield rather than just watching. Also, it's not a two-hour buildup and a five minute fight - since you can only get souls from other people after the initial grabs are taken, you have to skirmish a lot.The graphics are wonderful - lots of explosions and other nice effects, like with lightning sparks.On the other hand, it has a couple problems. A game tends to turn into a landslide easily with the first skirmish - since your opponent takes your souls, you have less to fight his army that just got bigger. All in all, though, this game is quite good, and 4/5 is a pretty good estimate of it.Buy this game if you're a fan of Starcraft or C&C but don't like the ""build lots of structures and train troops for a while, then one big fight and it's all over"" cliche."
2,BUGS! They kill this game!,"This title has a ton of potential, but the fact that it's loaded with bugs and took me over a week just to figure out how to get the dang thing to run (hit ESC while the story is being told) without it locking up. I like the interface and the graphics are great, but it's about time software companies start putting out a quality product. If you like downloading patches and reading tech support bulliten boards, buy this game. Otherwise, wait for the next Blizzard title."
3,Great graphics - too many bugs,"My experience with this game albeit short has been fraught with first one little problem and then another. First the DirectX problems have to be worked out and then either myself or another player gets knocked off the site within 5 min. of starting a game. Work out the problems and then sell the game. Graphics are great but the computer generated players can create 3 or 4 X faster than you can, especially when learning to play the game."
5,all good things,"this is the best game i've seen in a long time, a long time. until warcraft III comes out this will be the best rps out there. if you think war3 will be good but don't want to wait for it to come out get this game."
5,Game of the Year!,"This has to be the very best, hands down game I have ever played! The sound, gameplay, and grphics will knock you out of your seat! Buy it now, be one of the first people to enjoy this in single play and multi player! GET IT NOW! What a Awesome game! TFS_Coffee Need some more info on the game or help with it contact me via neotenic@pacbell.net and I shall do my best. TFS_Coffee"
1,Poorly Manufactured and Supported,"This game was shipped without an apparently necessary CD-Code on the front of the CD jewel case. I emailed the support line and heard nothing for 2 weeks. I exchanged it for another one and found the same problem. My local store is returning the whole shipment. In the meantime, Shiny entertainment still hasn't gotten back to me. God forbid I need their help with a bug once I actually get to play the game!"
5,Extremely entertaining RTS game,"This is the best 3D RTS game I have ever played. Spectacular graphics and sound effects even two years after it was released. As a wizard you control your creatures across vast landscapes of magical 3D worlds to battle with other wizards. You earn access to spells and creatures along the way depending on which god you serve in a particular world. Each creature possesses special traits and powers.Trying different offensive and defensive strategies is what makes the game so much fun. I recommend fast hardware if you are like me and want ALL the detail settings at ""insane"", like a P4 Northwood and a DirectX 8.1, 64/128MB video card.Ever thought you could be pulled up in a tornado and still live to win the fight? In Sacrifice you can.If anyone at Shiny is reading....Sacrifice 2!"
4,Pretty good game,"What I especially liked about this game is the fact that it's not very linear, you have a certain freedom of chosing your missions. I also liked the design of each level, the terraing is simply amazing with vast fields and great plains. Very fun to explore, very fun to play.The game is a real-time strategy type of game, much like Starcraft or Warcraft. You basically create troops consisting of various creatures and also ""buildings"" which are actually mana fountains that replenish your mana. Then you go to battle."
4,A accurate reveiw,"I have played many games for the PC and this is a very good one. The graphics are stuning and the environment and storyline are superb. There are some problems though. This game is among the hardest I've ever played. In it I'm just able to get past the first two misions until I used cheats though. There are many different ways to begin this game and end it but also you need a very good graphics card or everything will be in blue and gray. But if you have a good graphics card and are up for hour of fun and challenging play, this is a must buy"
3,"Great Fun to Learn, very low replayability","While Sacrifice is an absolutely beautiful game with great sound and a fresh (at the time) approach to RTS, there isn't much that makes me want to play it over again. The Single Player campaign is a set of branching mission choices, each of which affects the rest of the campaign. Potentially you may want to explore the entire thing. I get the feeling, however, that while there are subtle variations in the plot, it boils down to the same conclusion no matter what choices you make along the way. It is probably much cheaper now than at the time of release-- if you want to drop $... to experience a rich and beautiful world for a few days to a week of intense gaming, it's a good choice. Beyond that, you might be disappointed.And I'm absolutely miserable at MP RTS, so I won't even bother mentioning it."
5,I want this game.,I use to play this game & I want to buy this game but I have a Windows 7. Would the game still work? I'm asking coz I don't wanna buy the game & the game ends up not working.
2,No Game Disc?,"So I got my NWN package today, and i opened it up to find two installation discs. Only two installations discs. I did not receive a copy of the game with my order. Thanks a lot."
1,Nightmare with Neverwinter Nights,"What an intriging little dialogue box in the ""uninstall"" portion of this game. ""We have found associated files in the NWN file folder...do you want them deleted?"" Click yes only if you want to delete 3/4 of your desktop and half of your crucial files!!! In eight years of computer gaming I have never seen anything like this on a pc game...ever. This game functioned so poorly and so erratically on my pc (2ghtz, 128meg ram, vodoo 3d video card) that I could not believe it was from the makers of Baulder's Gate. Don't risk your computer or test your frustration tollerance on this. At any cut rate price it isn't worth it! I regret there wasn't a rating less than one star."
1,Neverwinter Ripp off,"This game is a ripp off! in order to play it online folks your going to have to buy all the exspaion disks too. Be warned! You'll not be able to play this game online without them and a whole lots of hassels!!!!!!! it stinks badly, plus you cannot return this stuff after you've opened the game for a re-fund either!"
2,Very buggy,I like many other people was very dissapointed withNeverwinter Nights the game is so buggy you cant passchapter two. the game runs at very bad frame rate evenfor my new computer a pentium 4 with a geforce 2 mxand building a module is nearly impossible (believe me I've tried)the only good thing about the game is playing online.
2,Avoid this like the wailing death!,"IF you're lucky, this game will actually run on your computer. Then just hope your CD doesn't crack. Or that the patches won't lock your computer or ruin your saved games. Or that the hours spent on making a mod are down the drain because a patch messed them up. Or that... And these are not isolated incidents. MANY people are having these problems and MORE!This game was thrown together to appease a software company with a deadline. The greatest RPG that never was..."
2,A Disaponting Game,"This game was extremly disaponting. I am a hard core baulder's gate and icewind dale fan. I was looking forward to neverwinter nights as the next leval of play. It is the most thorough game yet with more spelles and classes than ever before it is lacking somthing however. It feels like an action game. The plot is boring and uncomplex, it failed to hold me for even an hour compared to icewind dale witch I was able to play all day. Also the way it is set up, it just does not feel like an RPG it feels like a shooter. All the plot points involve killing somthing. All in all this was a disapointing game for a hard core RPG fan."
2,Terrible game,"After I heard about NWN coming out I was looking forward to it, well I bought the game and the help guide. I read through the help guide for about an hour before I was able to get home and play it, well I get home and install it (which takes an hour or so) after that happened I went to go play well now I needed a patch so I went and downloaded that, I get the patch and begin to play, I played for about 50 minutes and then it dawned on me that this game has terrible graphics and the gameplay overall [stinks]. I'd rather play WarCraft 3, JK2, or Counter-Strike."
1,This game stinks,"In short, this game is a stinker.Bioware marketed this game as a way to create your own D&D; adventures, yet they don't support the toolset used to create your advenures. Also, individually made adventures crash within 15 minutes of playing them.The game was marketed as using the rules of D&D; 3rd edition. This is not true. It uses a terrible mutation of these rules.Also, you are more limited in the toolset than in other games that marketed their toolsets as add-ons, not as the focus of their product (like Morrowind, which is MUCH better).Finally, Wizards wear jumpsuits, not robes, in Neverwinter Nights. So unless you envision Gandalf in a jumpsuit and think that's cool, be prepared for your character looking like a total idiot the entire time you play.I could go on, but I won't. The games not worth anymore of my time."
5,Awesome Game :),"i read other peoples posts on the offcial forums and i saw that many people complained about the game so i decided to download the warez version to check it out and it was awesome except for the fact that after 10-15 mins of gameplay it froze up, so i thought maybe it does that because its the warez versoin so i went on ebay and bout the game and sure enough it did the same thing, but i didnt give up so i posted on the forums for a few days with my problem and i found many similar posts with the same problem as mine, then 1 guy told my that you cant use the newest ATI drivers and to install the older drivers so i did that and now its runner soo smooth and i just love this game, as for the toolset.. thatsone of the best parts, im currently working on and adventure set in a village called crimmor and the options are just awesome. well all i have to say is this game is great i give it 5 stars"
2,Not my cup of ale,"The game is a FPRPG with a rather difficult-to-get-used-to interface. I admit to liking the 3rd person RPG format better(Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale) which translates to the lower ranking here. If you like FPRPGs, this may work for you, though you're limited in where you can go and what you can do. After a few hours of play, and a lot of saving, the game interface gets frustrating, making the game less than playable (or enjoyable) for me."
3,*sigh*,"Man oh man! i just didnt like this game at all. the camera, useful but annoying was just made poorly.And when i decide to vs. some other NWN players (PvP) the servers were so full of hackers that you couldnt do any good clean fighting, or trading for that matter. Though, the storyline was pretty good. Graphics, and monsters/NPC's were also very good. If you are looking for a REALLY DAMN GOOD RPG, buy Morrowind, maybe even Tribunal expansion (caveat emptor i havent got it yet, so i dont know if it is any good, but Bethesda made it, and it IS Morrowind material). my conclusion, buy this if, and only if, you are a HARDCORE D&D fan. if you dant kno what D&D is, you are a total lamo. bye."
3,a distraction,"This game is fun, but really it is just a distraction for me that doesn't leave me feeling any accomplishment when I finish."
2,Neverwinter Nights,"As a long time CRPG player,I would have to say that it was a great disapointment.(considering the LONG wait and all the Hoopla)Unless your SCRIPT litterate (which MANY people are not) the Builder is almost useless,and the reference/source book that comes with the game gives NO real help about basic scripting within the NWN Builder.Multiplayer issues....suffice it to say it's Gamespy supported ; anyone that plays multi a lot will know what I'm talking about.Singleplayer play is MODERATELY amusing/entertaining with some new and interesting aspects.All in all,I figure it wasnt worth what I payed for it.(but it would HAVE been if Bioware had released some basic NWN scripting help (in the package) AND if they had coughed up a SMALL portion of my 50 bucks to support a decent server interfaced specifically for NWN.)"
2,Boring for the single player campaign,"Many of the reviewers have mentioned that the Campaign Editor is a powerful and fun tool, but I have to get into a game before I can use it's advanced tools. I couldn't get into NWN. I just get bored dungeon crawling and finding tons of cool items that neither I or any henchman can use.NWN is a little more than Dungeon Siege, but that's not saying much. At least games like Diablo knew what they where and perfected it. NWN lacks direction.I really enjoyed Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. This game is not nearly as enjoyable."
5,"One Game, Infinite Possibilities","I have never been as pleased with a game as I have been with Neverwinter Nights. The actual 'game' that you play when you buy it seems a bit weak and didn't keep me entertained. Honestly, though, that isn't why I bought this game. NWN is about Dungeons and Dragons on the computer. A Dungeon Master can create an adventure and through the online play, have friends from across the world play through it.The scripting is easy but for those who don't want to take the time to learn it, the community is vibrant and enthusiastic more than willing to churn out whatever you want. Most likely, whatever you want, someone else has thought of and already posted it to one of the massive archives.This is one game that much like the table-top D&D;, you will be playing for years to come."
2,Neverwinter nights,This game was not as good as everyone made it out to be. After playing this one I did not get any others of the series.
1,Buyer be Aware,"Ok First of all this is the first real review. I am i the first person to review this product after it's release.Ok As to product Was so excited to the release couldn't wait. even preorder this item a year before it was due to release. When it was released amazon took so long we went and got a copy at a real store. When we got home we loaded it up. After installing the normal pre menu movies came up they played perfectly. Then menu came up well here where everything feel apart. Game crashes locks up, delays on talking. I am ten minutes into the game to to it problem. I also want to meantion I have xp and all the game requierement even the sound and grafic card they recommend. The have already had a patch but it really did nothing to inprove the parts of the game that we are having problems with. I'm sure some day this game will play right. But right now I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this game. We even discussed selling this copy so we don't have to deal with this lovely product."
2,Oh my god what a disgrace to my beloved paper game,"This game is an insult to the world of Dungeon and dragonsCome on even Pool of Radiance is better than this.What the heck is this going back to the old format of dnd games Hello there, gamer want perspective like diablo2 Baldur's gatewhere you can see your charcter see in slash, cast a spell not a permenant camera following you has if you were in a maze.Extremely complicated for nothing thank good i have a geoforce2 asus 7700 powered by nvidia or else is it back to store for a refund or an exchange.I got nothing else to say that wasn't said from the other reviewers... Get Warcraft3 and Diablo2 or even Pool of Radiance, Icewindale...GhostRider666 the spirit of vengeance"
4,This is is Neverwinter with the Battle on.....,"I Saw this game on gamespot and got a rating od 9.2 awesome!!!! When i play the game it Sucks!!! First of all my computer is verry fast and takes about 5 minutes to kill one person U die in 2 or 3 hits and is very Frusrating The town guards in the game are useless!!! I get chased by zombies,Goblins and Crazy psychos and they dont help me at all!!! This game is verry long and boring If you want a game like this get Diablo and Diongeon Siege."
4,"Solid game, but the Official Campaign sucks","This is a really fun game, but don't worry about playing the Official Campaign. It's not very good. However the user content is amazing. Some of the best modules are Shadowlords and Dreamcatcher (http://adamandjamie.com/nwn/)."
5,a good rpg,"thanks amazon readers for bringing life back to this game. i had finished the first chapter and uninstalled it a few months back. i hated the limited camera angle where you could not see beyond few feet. then, i came across a review which said that you could hack the camera angle. thank you thank you, for now i have renewed interest in the game - the 3d camera works well.the graphics are not that good (and bloatware) compared to knights of the republic which uses less memory and has much better graphics (why can't they develop nwn with kotor graphics engine beats me..)anyway, the story is good if not great, and character development is fun (i am using a paladin/theif along with linu the cleric). gameplay is good and lasts hours and hours.a great game for rpg fans!"
2,Mindless and Dull,"Despite the susposedly titanic failure of Morrowind... I have to give Neverfun Nights a horrible review. Simply put, this game is mindless and dull. I find myself talking to NPCs and wishing that I could just get on with it and do some fighting. Then I do some fighting and I wish that I could talk to some NPCs. Furthuremore, if I'm buying equipment, I find that I wish I was doing either of the above unpleasant actions. The problem is that the game is TOTALLY linear with uninventive environments and scenarios. The only reason I gave this game more than one star is that on occasion when I am feeling particularly tired, the game can be a little addictive. Sort of like Diablo 2..."
1,A weak effort,"If you like eye candy without substance and being told a lame story rather than writing your own, which is the true mark of an RPG, then you might like this game. I COULD suffer along with the ridiculous 3rd person view, and I could perhaps ignore the lack of ability to interact with the environment making the game a simple hack'n'slash circa 1993. However, I have an intense dislike for linear 'RPGs' that force you down a storyline with little or no flexibility or freedom to explore and have fun. In short (mainly because talking any longer about this dog is a waste of time) I thought it was a terrible gaming experience and was severely disappointed. Game ran fine, looked nice, and I disliked almost every other aspect of the effort."
3,Warning for multiplayers!,"My husband bought this game with the hopes we could play with our friends (who live in places from Seattle, Washington to the United Kingdom).If even ONE player has a 56K modem, you can only play with two people! Luckily a friend told us this before we opened the package and we got a full refund. And of course the Mac version won't be out for a while."
1,simply doesn't work,This game simply doesn't work out of the box - it crashes back to the desktop on my Windows XP computer before it even starts. As others have noted here - the Bioware forums are -full- of people who cannot run this game. Ultima IX redux.Don't waste your money.
2,Seems a little dated to me...,"Although the game itself has many features that would make a great RPG, the problem is it would have made a great RPG a yr or two ago... The graphics look dated, the monsters and sidekicks can be complete dolts when it comes to basic pathfinding, and if you do get the game running you might be left slightly dismayed by the entire plot...with great RPGs like Morrowind, and Dingeon Siege, and the excellent RTS Warcraft III on shelves... I reccomend passing this one up, the hype was definately over-rated."
1,Want to install this game? Want sound to work?,"Tough. This game is loaded with problems. It will not install (to install you have to take the sound card out and copy the cd image to disk). After it finally does the sound kills the game. This is not a consumer quality game.The idea is great, but the timing is bad. It looks like BioWare didn't even test Win2000. Why do they claim it's supported on the box?IMHO buy it used if you must have it or wait for them to release software worth paying full price."
2,Single player fans forget it,"If you want to play online, it is worth getting, but the single player game is not worth the price. You will spend half your time bashing open chests and the other half in mindless hack n slash.If you buy it expecting another Baldur's Gate level of single player game, you will be very disappointed, it is a clone of Diablo2."
3,Was just ok for me,"The game is put together very well, I just could not stay interested in it since it had no 1st person view on it."
3,ARRRGGGG!,"Buyer beware.If you have a high-end machine, NWN will crash it repeatedly in multiplayer mode. Go to their site and check out all of the problems - currently, 38% of people are having problems with this software.That being said, when the bugs are fixed this will be a fantastic game and a great tool for playing D&D; with all your buddies that moved away or had children and are no longer willing to chill and play in your basement. I am addicted already - I just have to restart every 20 minutes!The DM tool is grand...but there are a few bugs there and not (yet) enough variety of monsters - no centaurs, for example, or common housecats.All in all, if I had it all to do again, I would have waited a couple months for all the bugs to blow over and then bought a copy and downloaded all the patches. Still, it is fun and I still recommend it with reservations."
3,Do not buy it for the single player game,"If you are buying it for the on-line play, or toolset, you will like it (although the toolset requires scripting if you want to go beyond very simple constructs).The single player game Bioware made for the game is disappointing. It plays exactly like diablo2. It was so tedious I couldn't finish it, no real story, and nothing but combat and breaking into barrels and chests. More than half the game is simply searching through all the barrels and chests in the streets amd dungeons, the other half is hack and slash combat."
3,Boring,"I was really looking forwards to NWN. I ran out and bought it as soon as it was released. And it was...okay. I used it in single-player mode. It was dull. The plot is fairly straightforwards and written for you ahead of time. There is no real variability. You go on Quest A. To accheive it you must go into Cave 1, and walk through Forest 1, where stupid things happen that cause you to go on to Cave 2 and Forest 2. And so on, only sometimes you are in a city or town so substitute houses and districts there for forests and caves. The camera angles only annoyed me, but I have never been a big special effects fan. The ending is totally annoying, in that you get zero reward after the uber-battle, and never even find out what happens in the big plotline."
2,Read This Before Wasting Time and Money,Do not buy this game if you have a Windows 2000 system especially if you have a AMD Athalon Processor and AGP card. No matter how many Megs of RAM you have or how good your graphics card you will still have problems. People with high end systems (Windows 98 OS) that exceed the recommended system requirements have also reported problems. This game smells of beta. Wait another 2 months before a purchase and save yourself the frustration ...If you think you are going to come home and DM your own LAN game with one CD you will quickly find out that the CD-Key authentication and BioWare's EULA extends into your own home. Each person that comes over to your house for a LAN party must have their own CD and the CD-Key must be different.
4,Wow!,"I loved this game! It was SO fun. I woke up practically every morning last summer to play it! So, it was a little short and I had a fair share of games glitches, but hey, I thought it was MAJORLY fun! The graphics were really amazing and the battles weren't impossible, or too easy! It was really awesome to become powerful and burn 100's of thousands of gold pieces! I really loved it!"
3,nice game but a bit too tame,"played the single player part of the game, nice but none too original storyline, would have been more interesting if the developers went all out make it really gutsy, i find it too tame and perhaps ok with pre-teens, would have prefered if the developers added a language filter, some random events and generaly make it less homey. would like to see a bit more gore, the dialog is lame, and some of the henchmen's battlecry is too annoying example is Linu. this is stableto run, never had any problems with crashes, would be realy cool if this game is just as naughty as Fallout 2"
4,ALMOST Perfect,"First off let me say I like this game alot. I have played I believe all of the bioware D&D; games, Baldurs Gate, I,II,Throne,Planescape and Icewind Dale. So far my favorites have been Baldurs Gate 2 and Planescape. If you played any of those games and liked them you will love this game. In case you are wondering why this game only got 4 stars, I thought it was a step down from Baldurs Gate 2. There were no different quests for different classes. I really enjoyed the diferent replay value and the way so much of BG2 was designed around your individual classes. I realize one of the great things about NN is that you can make your own modules and build them how you would like too, but I really missed this built into the single player game. God knows they had plenty of time to do it. I think I have been hearing about this project for at least 3 years.If you ever liked D&D; this is a must buy."
1,Want premature white hair? Then definately BUY THIS GAME!,"I have never been so angry with a game publisher in my life. I have a relatively new (6 months old) Pentium III 1 GHZ system with 384 MB RAM which runs EVERYTHING I have ever tried without a problem: Diablo II, DungeonSiege, you name it.Then I installed NWN. I spent over 8 hours trying to get it to work. I updated drivers. I browsed their support forum. And in the end, I paid $150 to have my computer rebuilt and spent another 8 hours re-installing all of my software.What do the developers say in response? ""Hey, it works on our computers -- we've been playing it 8 hours a day!"" (paraphrase, not exact quote). Well, I'm very glad they've spent their time writing a game that they can play -- I hope they have fun with it. I just think it is incredibly stupid and unprofessional to release software of such poor quality. Maybe the game is great, but the deployment package is absurd."
1,BUG RIDDEN DOWNGRADE FROM BALDURS GATE II,"The game might deserve a 3 star rating if it worked, but it is filled with problems.First, the game doesn't run for more than about 15 minutes.Second, when it does run it is sluggish, even on my fairly fast machine with an Athlon 1400Mhz an ATI Radeon 8500 (with latest drivers) and 768 megs of ram.Third, the graphics are less appealing than the beautiful 2D produced by Baldur's gate. I the benefits of 3D aren't worth the poorer image quality.Fourth, the henchmen don't really have any personality and don't add to the game.Fifth, sometimes when it crashes it destroys the ""quick save"" saved games.Definately don't buy if you are interested in the Single player experience! It might be alright for DM and creating modules, but wait till the MANY BUGS are fixed. I can't imagine playing multiplayer and having party members dropping out every few minutes to reboot their machine because the software forced them to do a hard reboot."
2,Similar to Baldur's gate minus most of the fun.........,"This game looks really impressive, but gameplay is inferior. I am a dedicated fan of the Baldur's gate series and have completed BG1 and 2 and the expansions. This game has the same feel and adds some abilities, but completely lacks the party system that makes the D&D games fun. The biggest drawback is that you can only have 1 henchman and cannot directly control him. This means that you can only experience the abilities of your own character. It seems that the only playable class is the fighter since your character always has to enter the room first and a wizard will get ripped to shreds. You have to decide if you want to actually win a fight and go with a fighter or if you want to avoid traps and open chests with a rogue. You can really only have one. There are a lot of other problems that take the fun out of the game. This game seems to be set up only for multiplayer, and the problem with that is finding people you want to play with."
4,An Experience,"Ah, where to begin. Neverwinter Nights is not the best game in the world, nor will it replace table-top adventures with your friends or even the incredibly famous Baldur's Gate series. That out of the way, it is a very strong game by itself; it is fun to play and pushes you closer to what Dungeons and Dragons is really like. Of course that means that you will need friends to play with (and a good DM, while not completely neccecary, can make things that much more interesting).This is a multiplayer game geared to give you control over only one character at once which does leave the single player a bit lacking. That is neglectable, however, because of the ability of users to create their own levels with a toolset that is both simple and flexible, quite a feat in itself.This game is worth the money if you decide to dip into the vast pool of humans out there in the community. Yet, keep in mind that, being humans, they are not all great to play with."
5,Why not?,"This is a great game. It takes fantasy, role playing and strategy and mixes it all up in one. This game is overall lots of fun and is very easy to learn how to play."
1,What a waste.,"I can only echo the thoughts of what others have said so far, if you do not have the correct hardware you will probably have big time problems getting this game to work. The requirements on the box don't help any since a lot of people who meet or exceed the stated requirements are having problems with this game (Bioware should have included a large bottle of extra-strength aspirin with this game). The only advice that I can offer is, when buying ANY game always check out the games support page to see what kinds of problems people are having before you buy. I learned this lesson the hard way, if I had checked out NWN's website I would have passed on this game, too many people having too many problems. What a waste."
3,Installation problems,"Lot of installation problems... works with NIVDIA and ATI Radeon Video cards only... It does n't support other video cards.. Game simply freezes/goes balank...If you can successfully run NWN, you can have lot of FUN..."
4,What this book is and isn't,"This is a wonderful book which can help designers be more aware of those who may be looking at their work, who have differences in culture and how they see the world. At least those who live in the U.S.This book focuses mostly on those who live in ""America"" who are of different cultures. And that is a good thing.What would be even more helpful for some of us, is to know how to design for international audiences outside of the US, but then I suppose that would be more than 1 book - more like a whole library of them.And a further challenge is to be able to design ""across cultures"" internationally (which seems mostly impossible!)But there are good, general guidelines which are valuable to those who need to make sure their concepts and designs, don't offend those to whom they wish to express ideas."
4,Nice decorative touch,These push pins are a nice change from the standard types normally used and are especially handy for mounting art work or photos on cork boards.Alan Safani
5,ONE OF THE BEST MELODIC METAL TO DATE!!!,"I wish there were 100 stars 'casue this album is not only the best DT album out there it falls under as one of the best melodic death metal albums of all time!!! I recommend u get the new deluxe edition which includes the EP ""Enter Suicial Angels"" which is their best EP! The song Aazofever is just amazing from this EP!!! I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!DT 4ever"
4,Handy-dandy Grass Deflector,"I bought this item on sale for $8.53 with free shipping and handling. When I saw the price had dropped from the normal $19.99 I jumped on it. I had been eying this thing ever since I started weed-eating the yard with the standard shield on my gas-powered weed-eater.Every time I would weed-eat, I would wind up with grass all over me, no matter how I held the device or to which ever side I had it positioned. I received the The Shield Debris Deflector and attached it immediately. I started weed-eating to see how it handled. For the most part it deflected the grass. However, some of the grass still flicked up on me. So, for the most part it did the job. I wish it did it better, but it is worth the extra $11 just to not be totally grass-ridden. And if you can get free-S/H that is even nicer."
1,Secularsciencism idolatrous fabrication,"This has gone too far. This is not science. This is not theology.This is secularsciencism brainwashing forcing Scripture as reinterpreted to agree with its worldly-darwinistic conclusions and theories from godless theory-spinners like Carl Sagan, Edwin Hubble,Stephen Hawking, and earthly-wisdom educated astrophysicists.It is a travesty when astrophysics presumes to tell the Bible what it means. Rather, the Word of God tells astrophysics to submit itself to 6 normal calendar earth-rotation days as the Genesis Workweek of the Lord as Moses understood. If Moses didn't have a PhD in astrophysics when writing Genesis and believed in a Sunday-Friday literal creation yoms of 24 hrs, then of course that's what the Bible's original intent and meaning today is.reviewed by Juliet W. Larsen, apologist"
1,Dr. Ross fails to convey Moses' original contextual intent,ONLY MOSES' ORIGINAL INTENTSETTLES HOW LONG THE FIRST OF WEEKDAYS WENT.
1,bad exegesis,"[http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/Genesis.asp] [www.answersingenesis.org] has numerous refutations of 'progressive creationism' and specifically of Ross' assertation of the meaning of the Hebrew word for day (yom). They clearly demonstrate the grammatical errors of his claim. Also see the book ""Refuting Compromise"" by Jonathan Sarfati, Ph.D."
1,shredding scripture,"when science tells the bible what to say,it shreds the christian faith to ground filet."
1,Big Bang is Biblical Bust,"Science's 'big bang' is a biblical bust, a whimsical whimper best left undiscussed. Genesis clearly says it was a WORD, not cosmic self-exploding that first stirred the universe from nothingness to be a recent history's creativity. Take reason's billioned years and lay them bare against the WORD of God's Son Who was there. He proves that It Is Written in 6 Days of am/pm houring - one week's phase - He made the earth from water, then the sky, and on Wednesday the sun, moon, stars shined high, taking the light that already set clocks arranging earth's solstice and equinox, and put it into astronomic spheres before light-instants down-switched to light-years."
4,A Thoughtful Contribution to the Creation Debate,"In this book, Dr. Hugh Ross, does a very good job of making the case for an old Earth creation.Although many Christians of the young Earth creation persuasion will likely disagree strongly with him, the author makes a strong case for his point of view. He makes a very solid case for his position on scientific, Biblical, and linguistic grounds.The main controversy on the creationist side of the fence is whether the six days of creation described in Genesis are 24 hour days or longer epochs. Dr. Ross clearly holds the position that these days are much longer than 24 hour periods.Regardless of one's perspective on this issue, this is an important contribution to the debate and should be read by everyone who is interested in the topic."
1,MIS interprets Genesis,"This book spends an amazing amount of paper and ink to redefine the normal Bible understanding of the simple word ""DAY"".Using modern science understanding, of course the author arrives at what he believes DAY to mean - anything BUT the natural definition used throughout the Bible.As for a majority of Genesis readers and Bible students, I will go with the original definition: 24-hr earth rotation.Thus, the Bible was originally intended and is still to be interpreted as giving us a Young Earth understanding.This book fails to take into account how the Bible has been understood from Moses' time, Rabbinic interpretation and the Early church as well as Reformation up until the time of Darwinism.Try John MacArthur's BATTLE FOR THE BEGINNING for an antidote to this book's mis-interpretations."
1,allows science to define bible's own terms?,"The main troubling aspect of this book is it grants secular science free licence to define biblical terms on its behalf.No doubt the Bible can define its own terminology quite well, thanks anyway.Mr. Ross' book doesn't resolve anything except in the author's own mind. Genesis days still stand as verse 14 of Chapter 1 distinguish them from seasons and years. Much of what science postulates is unsettled, changing, subject to revision and quite elastic depending on the theory prevalent in the spotlight. Genesis is settled once for all, unchanging. Why subject it to the same revision astrophysics is subject to?"
1,God inspired Moses PRECISELY what to document,"This book fails to do justice to the inerrancy of Scripture. If the Holy Spirit needed editorial help, interpretive assistance or grammar & spell-checker to describe PRECISELY how God created on each workday, He didn't ask Dr. Ross or other revisionists of Biblical history. Yes, the Lord made the sun, moon & stars on the 4th calendar day. As the Lord of time, He knew very well from setting the earth rotating on its axis on the first day that it was now 72 hours later. Why is it so hard for people to accept God's Word AS WRITTEN, without semantic gymnastics or redefining God's terms to favor speculative evolutionary categories and compromisingly accomodate to secularsciencism? ""Let God be true and every man a ______(you know the rest)."""
1,"With the Lord, 1,000 years is like one of our days","Some readers feel Moses was waxing poetic in writing the Creation account. The days he used are really ""like 1,000 years"", much LONGER than a literal reading, for a total creation 'week' of 6,000 years. That still puts earth's age @12,000 years, relatively young.Actually, the days were much SHORTER than a literal reading.Both Moses (Ps. 90) and 2Peter3 mention that with the Lord, ""1,000 years is like a day"". Therefore, Day 1 of Genesis is as follows: 365,000 Lord's days(Genesis) = 1 human day. Thus 1 Genesis/Lord's day = 1/365,000 human day =.25seconds. The entire creation 'week', in 'Genesis' timing, took (with 86,400 seconds per day) 6/365,000 human days = 1.5 seconds.This author did not do justice to Genesis math, so the book rates one lone star. Psalm 90 and 2Peter are conclusive, decisively settling the 'matter of days' beyond equivocation."
5,Lots of body,"Excellent, increasingly hard-to-find product; makes baby-fine hair thick and able to hold a style. Highly recommended!"
2,Time Has Passed Them By,"I used to be in an acoustic group in college (I'm 52 now) and cannot sing close to the way I used to. America has the same problem. No one liked these guys better than I did and I had everyone of their songs on this DVD memorized. However, I just turned it off after the third song. I don't want my memory of their harmonies to be ruined. If you just want to hear their music and remember the old times, this DVD may work for you. If you expect the vocals to even be close to what they were in years gone by, skip this one."
5,Excellent Concert!,Live Concerts are not perfect that's what makes 'em Great! All of America's classics here and then some....outstanding A&V.
5,America in Concert Live at the Sydney Opera House,Loved It!!!! I watch it all the time. It brings back so many memories hearing those songs. The sound was great!
1,what a disappointment,"I had an America concert from SoundStage on PBS saved on my DVR box, but when it broke down, I had to turn it in, concert included. When I saw this DVD, I immediately bought it, as I've always loved this band. The sound is absolutely horrible. You can't even listen to it @ 5.1. I'm not sure who mixed this thing, but I think they were actually deaf. The concert itself is good, but I was really hoping for something better than I had recorded off of regular TV. Save your money."
1,Living off their fame,"I've been a fan of America since the 70's, but this video was painful to listen to. They are terrible in this video. It's pretty clear to me that the band is living off their prior fame. They can't reach the high notes anymore and butcher alot of their former hits."
1,disappointing,"Being an America fan for so long, I expected a lot from this Sydney concert. But...First of all, the sound has very poor quality, especially the volume, which goes up and down spontaneously many times. Second, the voices of our beloved musicians seem to have gone for ever. They seem to have a lot of trouble finding their tone, truly sad.I am still considering if I should send this DVD back, or keep it as a sad memory of what used to be."
2,America in Concert - Live at Sydney Opera House,The guy is right. They've been milking their hits too much. The voices are not the same. The instruments sound good.
2,SHOULD HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED,"I am a big fan of America. I saw them live recently and they definitely still have ""it"". They are as great as ever. This DVD - I am surprised they would allow it to be released. Whoever did the video work on this one should be banned from ever working in the business again. None of the shots show any enthusiasm or energy from the guys, and they do not come across well at all. Sound quality is so-so. I would not waste my money on this one again. I give it two stars only because it is America in concert."
3,Fun for a minute,"I enjoyed this cute little game. It really helped me practice my hand-eye coordination for the parts where you have to take snapshots of the ""celebrity"" as they zoomed passed the screen. I'm a big fan of seek and find, so the game was fun. My only problem is that I felt it was too short and maybe it should have had a save feature. Other than that, it was ok."
2,Has a lot going for it...then goes nowhere,"Prowl, like Husk (the other After Dark Original to be released thus far), attempts to take an old horror industry standard (in this case, vampires) and do something different with it, but instead, it goes nowhere. Prowl revolves around teen Amber (Courtney Hope) who is desperate to leave her small town life behind and head into the big city. She, along with her dopey friends, get a lift from a trucker (Bruce Payne), but it isn;t long before they realize that something is very, very wrong. Without giving too much away, Prowl takes some tried but true vampire notions and tries to do some original things with them for a little bit, but the end result winds up being tedious and boring. The vampires themselves feel like rip-offs of the vamps from 30 Days of Night, and the big twist can be seen coming a mile away. All in all, you can do worse than Prowl, but you can do far better as well."
4,Good enough,"Released in 2010, ""Prowl"" is about a young woman, Amber, who desperately wants to leave her small town. She talks a group of friends into helping her get to Chicago, but they have serious set-backs on the road and worse when they make it to the big city. Horror ensues.The plot's thin and the second half marks time a bit, but I felt ""Prowl"" was just good enough to rate 4 Stars for a TV movie. Each of the three female protagonists are good-looking in their own unique way, especially Ruta Gedmintas as Suzy. There's some decent suspense and frights and the ending features a twist that I didn't see coming, even though the clues were there from the beginning.The film was shot in Bulgaria and runs 81 minutes.GRADE: B-"
1,Run from this movie!!,"Okay first of all I am an avid horror movie buff and I have seen almost every horror movie made. And as in all horror movies you have to suspend your belief and just go with the story wherever it goes. This movie is so poorly written and so obvious and on top of that completely preposterous. I should just tell you what happens and save you the time and money of seeing this train wreck, but that might bore you to the verge of suicide. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!! This is the problem with the After Dark movie line. Some are brilliantly written and are quite entertaining, but not this one. You have been warned!!"
2,"Good start, but disappointing then throughout","The start of the movie is setup well, and it really gave me the feel like I could be in for a great horror movie. Unfortunately, you lose a lot of the suspense when 4 of your 6 characters are killed off in 5 minutes. Even after that, they give you another sense that there could be more story developing with the two head vampires paying off the driver and discussing strategies....but nothing really comes of it. They do a horrible job of following up with any of this. One minor twist at the end and then the movie ends, so there's a feeling left that you need more. It's entertaining and somewhat thrilling at times, but overall the movie is just not pieced together as good as it could have been. 2 stars is the best I can give this movie."
3,Pretty cool worth a look,Not a classic but worth a rental. The ending was pretty good. it was a little slow at first but once they got out of the truck and the killing started it got better.
5,Great eye pillow!,"I am very happy with the Barefoot Yoga Silk Eye Pillow. It smells great, feels extremely soft and it just the right weight. I highly recommend it."
2,Don't fit in the Franklin Sports MLB Power Pitching Machine,Franklin Sports 1998 Dimple Training BallsThis product does not fit in the Franklin Sports MLB Power Pitcher Pitching Machine -- they are shown on the same page when you purchase the pitching machine for extra balls - but they do not fit in the tube that supplies the machine! They are too large!
2,Wrong size balls,These balls are labled as being for the machine I bought but they don't fit the pitching machine.The balls are bigger in diameter than the balls that came with the machine.
2,Lenox Cup Replacement,"The cup looks like the original, however the quality is not the same.The cup is much heavier, and not as translucent as the original.It is easy to pick out the replacement!"
5,good stuff,"This is some pretty strong garlic pills. It feels high quality, just the way it smells and tastes if you bite the gel pill. don't do it :-)I will surely buy more, when I run out."
2,Its ok,"The music on the DVD is wonderful! but I really could have done without the interviews in between the song. Once you really start getting into the music, your interupted with a boring interview or story. This would have been a great special feature, but they had to mix it in during the concert footage."
3,"Good, Basic Read","I have not read any other 'Donald Strachey Mysteries', so I am basing this book on its own. This is the kind of story that never really grabs you. It moves along well enough, and things unfold on schedule, but there never came a moment when I didn't want to put the book down. I appreciate the fact that it is a basic mystery novel that happens to have gay characters and for the most part steers clear of gay cliches and stereotypes. I'm sure this is worth a read if you're a fan of Strachey Mysteries, but it does not stand too tall on its own."
3,More whimsy than wit,"Don Strachey takes a backseat in this one to his partner Timmy, and a cast of characters that has a lot to say about almost nothing. Ominously, the book starts with a nonsensical phrase uttered repeatedly by the least developed character, Skeeter McCaslin. The rest of the story revolves around the highly dysfunctional newspaper publishing family of his late partner, Eric.There are moments of pure genius in the writing of 'Chain of Fools'. Unimaginable plot twists, and twists upon twists that you might think the author could never reliably resolve. But in the end, he does manage to tie together all the loose ends. Unfortunately, he does so in a most tedious manner. And the last chapter or two are torture to read. But if you love the Strachey stories, you have to have this one. So be tough, and buy the book."
4,Family Feud,"Don and Timmy are back, as Don investigates a family feud that has turned into murder. A brother and sister are both attacked, and Don believes the attacks are linked to their desire to sell the family newspaper.I liked this, especially for the small insights into Don and Timmy's life together. ""'That guy was actually trying to kill us!' Timmy blurted out. Under his sunburn, he looked pale and feverish and as vulnerable as I'd ever seen him. A wave rolled through me, and it occurred to me that one day Timmy would die.""Neil Plakcy, author ofMahu Surfer: A Hawaiian Mystery (An Alyson Mystery)"
2,Vice Academy 2,"Vice Academy 2 is a corny ripoff of the Police Academy series & similiar P.A. clones. The best thing about VA 2 is it's stars Linnea Quigley(Return of the Living Dead, Graduation Day, Savage Streets) and Ginger Lynn (various adult films, American Pie Presents Band Camp). The plot revolves around Quigley & Lynn going undercover to stop Spanish Fly from dumping chemicals in the water supply. Pretty stupid stuff, especially Bimbo Cop."
2,Pretty Cheaply Made,I bought several of these molds at Christmas time ..and honestly they're thinner plastic and more cheaply made (as far as how they fit together in the case of this one which has two sides) than I expected. I would not buy this brand again.
3,Not what I expected,"I foolishly didn't ""look inside"" before buying. It was published in 1947, so is probably a little out of date, and has no illustrations. As the title states, it's a LIST of birds. Period."
1,New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law,"Many of the opinions expressed in this ""new commentary"" are NOT CATHOLIC CHURCH teaching, but merely personal opinions.This causes confusion and error.For accurate information see: ""Code of Canon Law Annotated""."
5,A good practical resource for understanding Church law,"The fundamental purpose of canon law is the salvation of souls. It is therefore inherently pastoral in nature. It is a means of ordering the Catholic community and seeing that justice is done in that community.The new Commentary does an admirable job of presenting the most accurate English translation of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, as well as providing commentary on that Code that reflects accurately the pastoral nature of Church law. Beyond this, the commentary is very practical in its approach.The articles in the Commentary are written by the leading canonists in America. These commentators are exemplars of real faithfulness to the Church, as well as writing from extensive knowledge of their topics. As a practical resource for ministry in the Catholic Church, you will find nothing better at present."
5,Canon Law Explained,"This text is a clear and concise explanation of Canon Law as found in the Code of Canon Law 1983. This text can be used by both the professional Canon Lawyer as well as the pastoral minister in a parish in order to understand what the law means. This text provides the best explanation of the law, which is meant to be used in real situations in the Catholic Church."
5,Torch,Arrived on time in good condition.and a good price. The torch was very easy to use Will recommend to others
1,torch,"this torch is not advertised correctly. it says that it is high output, but it is not. it will not get hot enough to solder 2 inch copper tubing... i bought a lenox lt92 to replace it with.. this torch is more expensive, but it wii do the job excellent... the other torch is good enough fof the homeowner.. thats about it..."
4,Awesome book. Must have,These books are very handy. I totally reccomend it. It lead us to some very awesome things to do that we normally would not have found on our own.
3,Over rated,This is a great game but i think it is a little over rated.Pros...The graphics are totlay great and the rest isnt so great
4,fun and realistic,this games grafics arent so hot but that doesnt really matter the waves are cool and it is fun. you must play this game.the waves get huge and it gets alot funner.
5,Very Awesome--this from a Sponger,"Yes,I believe!!! I thought this game would be all hype, but the water graphics and surfing moves are dead on.....Its a beautigul and fun game to play...My thumbs are hurting!! after playing this game for about a weeks....Take note though, its not an easy game to master..It'll take time to adjust to the moving wave as well as some practice before you can starting busting out some crazy tricks.I'm about halfway thoough the levels with one character and some the tasks are hard to complete...Sure, you can say that the realism of the aerial moves are too-physiccts defying, but there has been no other surfing game that even ccomes close!!!!! I say buy this game, you wont regret it....BTW, this review is coming from a bodyboarder, and this game is truly impressive and worth ever dollar spent....."
5,Even the Sun Will Die,"The mixed reviews do not surprise me. They are an indication that this material is right for someone who has reached a certain point in their development where they are perhaps just at the verge of readiness to surrendering to what IS, rather than trying to control events.I listened to the audio CDs in my car and experienced a sudden shift, a deep understanding, accompanied by lightness and a feeling of expansion, although I had already read the book ""The Power of Now"". Make no mistake: this is a highly evolved being speaking to you. I understand that it is difficult for a fast-paced culture (like the American) to listen to the silence and laughter and hear the messages in it. This is the point. As to the 9/11 events: how appropriately he addressed this drama. Yes, drama. As it is merely drama that unfolds, but this IS NOT us. We are eternal being caught up in material reality in this incredible drama. Tolle knows how to bring people back to who they REALLY are."
5,Outstanding in every way,"I've listened dozens of times and each time learn something in a deeper way. The fundamental teaching is of course the same as The Power of Now, yet without as much intellectual explanation, but potentially with more depth if the listener is open. At the risk of being judgmental, I'm afraid those who have berated these CD's with one star ratings just have not yet ""got it"" and I urge them not to give up!"
5,Still a Classic Western After 40 Years,"I first watched""Culpepper Cattle Co. in 1977.The movie was five years old then but it was something very new to me. I was a senior in High School. Kids didn't get to see movies when they first came out.I just wanted to say Thank You, Amazon. I had searched for this movie forever and always came up with nothing."
3,Earthy and gritty western,Seems most like the real thing than most westerns I have viewed in the past.
2,Superb action/scenery-weak story tone,"Maginficent cattle action and scenery. Disappointing story line, at times very unbelievable. Overall tone does not inspire a good feeling. I found the ending section ridiculous---the kid has earlier killed the bartender, but now he 'bravely' refuses to use his gun on the villein, who is killed by one of the riders who suddenly comes to life. Also, I'm not into cult religion, but I find film's ridiculing depiction of the leader of the cult a blatant attack on religion in general."
5,They don't get better this!,"I saw this film when I was 12 back in 1981 on tv and was captivated and emotionally saddened as with few other films, especially western films. This film begins with a teenagers dream of becoming a cowboy and tears it down as the youth realizes what being a cowboy is really about. In many ways the film UNFORGIVEN by Clint Eastwood does the same thing only with gunfighters instead of cowboys. THE CULPEPPER CATTLE CO. is a much better film. It moves faster and has better characters.For years I have tried to rent or buy this movie. Almost no stores have it or have even heard of It. I finally found it at a video store that was liquidating its previously viewed films. I am so glad Amazon is now offering it. I hope that it ends up on DVD soon"
5,Perhaps the most realistic Western of all,"For realism, this movie is hard to beat!'Culpepper Cattle Co.' is the story of a young boy who has his heart set on becoming a cowboy. He is successful in getting hired as cook's helper on a drive.The movie chronicles the cattle drive, which encounters outlaws, a conspiracy of townspeople, and the normal arguments, drinking and fights between the drovers. It is gritty, and it 'feels real.' The boy, Ben, is surrounded by the rigors and realities of life on the trail.The characters are well and believably acted, although by relatively unknown actors (at least to me.) Which perhaps is best, because one is not distracted by the expectations of some movie star's predictable reactions to each situation.This is a fine movie, and one which provides some humor, suspense, and a good plot. It may be the best of its genre you will ever see, despite the lack of expensive, top talent to act the parts.Joe Pierreauthor, Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance"
5,Fascinating conversational intro to relativity and such,"I first read this book when I was thirteen and recently rediscovered it. Written in a conversational tone with many anecdotal illustrations, it is a fun introduction to math concepts, spatial math, relativity and similar matters. Not simple, but not hard either - it would be enjoyed by mathematically inclined teens or adults who have forgotten a lot of what we learned in high school and college."
5,Don't Think Too Hard,"This book takes very complex theories and theorems and puts them into simple, everyday words that most of us ""regular"" people can understand. By finally understanding them, you yourself will start to boggle your own mind thinking about other theories and maybe, if fortunate enough, will even form your own."
2,"Well written, but outdated","I bought this book to give to a younger relative, but upon reading it, I decided not to. Gamow is a good author. The book has many fun math and physics concepts, which are for the most part well-explained. The problem is that this book hasn't been updated in 50 years.Among the outdated statements in the book, you will find:- Refers to Fermat's last theorem as ""unsolved""- Talks about the undiscovered negative proton (aka antiproton)- Lacks any mention of DNA in the biology section- Incorrectly identifies N-C-O cycle of nuclear fusion as the primary energy source in the SunTaken alone, that doesn't seem so bad, but hose are just the ones that stand out in my head after reading this. I recall cringing somewhat often as I read this book and encountered another superseded theory."
2,Not exactly a how-to,"First of all, this was written in pre-internet 1992.So don't expect to find a listing of web-pages that will buy something from you.Not sure why I bought, curious in a morbid way I guess and this book satisfied my curiousity. However from the standpoint that you might want to actually use it to make money, forget it. A few searches on Google returns far more info."
1,"Yeah, but was it interesting?","I don't really care whether the book was true or not, though I do think it's interesting to hear both sides, you always want to know that about a book. But what I think really matters in terms of good literature is whether the book is interesting, instructive, exciting. This one wasn't, to me. It was kind of boring. I wanted to care about the main character, but she kept doing so many stupid things it just became impossible."
3,Hmmmm????,"Maybe Spike should have made better decisions and not blame everything on her lack of skill in finding a man. I respect her for what she has accomplished with her writing and the love she has for her son, but men are not the problem. I am a man so I tend to show bias on this subject."
3,"A Sad Story, but readable","It's all true. She does not learn from her mistakes, so the reader may find themselves wanting to hurl the book at the wall when she once again falls into her own traps. There were many times while reading that I found myself saying out loud, ""Oh Spike! Why?"" Especially when the topic of Dad came up - poor Dad, who buys her cars, who provides her with a summer house; poor Dad who doesn't understand rebellion. If you like contemporary memoirs, and I do, I still found this a compelling read. I ignored the one star reviews, because while I agree that her constant missteps are tiresome, she is a good writer. She shares a lot about herself - could you be so open about your own mistakes?"
2,glad she has a son,"I wonder how different this book would be, if it would even exist, if she didn't have Henry. The parts I liked most about the book - and I did find them touching, especially at the beginning and the end - were her letters to Henry. The rest is the same old same old. I vote with the other guy or gal here who would like to see Spike try her hand at fiction. Her passion could drive some good stuff. But everything I've seen about her is so self-absorbed, I don't know if she'd ever be able to let go of her true love, herself and her hurt. The one thing in the book that seems to have helped her do that a little is Henry. He sounds like a great kid."
1,A Tantrum Rant,"It's not the risks Spike takes that bother me about the storytelling in this book. It's that there are no interesting characters. The book is painted in a childish black-and-white version of the world: The evil guys, wonderful me, my horrible father, my wonderful son, the horrible woman in Knoxville, the three perfect men friends. I asked myself at the end of this book, ""Who would find this kind of person interesting, much less amusing or wise?"" Most of the book's humor came out as cheap shots at others, and as such made me cringe, not laugh. The book's style and anger and pace remind me of a loud drunk carrying on late at night, increasingly alone, desperate to be heard, and embarrassing those left in the bar around her. No empathy, no communication, no reflection: this book is a tantrum rant."
4,Honest Writing by a Cyber-Friend,"I have been reading Spike's column for over 2 year's and most of the ""blanks"" are now filled in. Spike makes you feel like you are a friend in whom she is confiding her life. Her book makes it easy to see yourself doing the same things, making the same mistakes and has you challenging yourself to admit it. A tremendously honest account."
2,I Found Her Accounts Unconvincing,"I guess my biggest problem with this book is that I didn't really believe Spike. This book, this writing, didn't seem to be the ""truth"" it claims to be, about either her, her lovers, her dad. I wondered not only if her view of things was twisted, but if certain events in her book ever actually happened. I got the idea that she destroyed relationships purposely so she'd have something to write about, because that's who she wants to be. She wants to be who's lived through horror. Began to wonder if there is any kind of man she wouldn't hate, or if there was any sort of intimacy she's capable of, without swinging from initial mania and happiness to the recurring ""revulsion"" at having sex."
1,Spike has finally worn me out.,"I've been reading Spike online for a few years now, and I used to love her columns and look forward to them. She exhausted me, though, and the book is just more of the same. I couldn't even finish it. I like people who learn from their mistakes. Instead, Spike seems to be finding grand truths from her experiences, but ultimately she runs up against the same stumbling blocks.Her writing is good, but that's not enough to carry the book."
1,I Must HaVE miSSED Something,"But I don't think so. I found the book tedious, self-indulgent. It made me feel like, I hope the protagonist can someday grow up, become adult, and gain maturity. Maybe that's what it was supposed to do, and maybe that's its stroke of brilliance. Could it be? We hate this character this time, but will be amazed at her growth in the future. Some reviewers seem to have jumped to volume three, but I'm still here judging only on the text we've been given. And it's pretty sad, pretty poorly written, pretty vicious, pretty juvenile. Postmodern lit is supposed to not have to explain stuff like this. You see it and you go, ""Oh, I get it, to be in on the joke, I admit I was almost taken in, but now I understand. The protagonist isn't self-absorbed and vain and selfish. It's a satire on modern life."" But I couldn't quite make that leap. I think it's bad lit."
2,"I disagree that this is a ""powerful"" book","I started this because a friend told me about it, but I couldn't finish reading it. The writing is sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, but the overall tone is relentless anger and blame of others. I simply didn't care enough about the protagonist to stick with it. For a memoir that shows some self-awareness, try Russell Baker's ""Growing Up,"" or Rick Bragg's ""All Over But the Shoutin',"" or Frank McCourt's ""Angela's Ashes."""
4,Very good insight into the stock market,provides very good insight into the stock market and breaks investing down into basics which are necessary to understand market jibberish
5,Cramer said to write a review about the book on the show,"Great book from a great man. Im a college student and I love the book. Jim, come to Fairleigh Dickinson University.steve"
5,jim cramer has his way,Jim Cramer has his way of teaching about stocks - It's different - but it's good - get past his silly on TV and learn through his experience.
1,What a sham!!,"As a fan of Cramer's and a relative newbie to investing of this sort, I was hoping that the ""champion of the middle class investor"" would provide us with something other than soundbites and repeats of his shows and other books - in this, I was sorely disappointed. Cramer is one of those guys who takes all the credit when things go right and none of the blame when they don't and this is evident from both his shows and his books. That said, he has been around the markets for a while and he has some valuable insights on stock picking but unfortunately his gigantic ego tends to spoil the rational side of his game. This book is yet another example of this ego and contains nothng but rehashed Cramerisms - what a one trick pony!!"
2,Buy the previous book,"Basically just a repeat of ""Real Money"" with only a couple of extra ideas thrown in. Really enjoyed and got a lot of useful investing advice out of ""Real Money"" and ""Confessions of a Steet Addict"", so this one was a big disappointment. Also a lot of typos in this one. Hope there was more effort put into the upcoming ""Stay Mad for Life""."
4,For the curious begginer trader,"This book delivers. Granted you might find some of this info online, but if you like sitting down with a book, or reading something on the train while going to work, pick this one up. It has a lot of good pointers and constant references to watch the show but hey I already do. I liked it, an easy read, a book that is both entertaining and educational, and kept me interested."
4,Buy it it will save you money,I have listened to both this books and yes I am a follower of his show. I've been an active investor for 25+ years and in college I majored in corporate finance/fundamental corporate analysis. I find this book extremely useful in driving home the type of analysis and research we should all do in picking which stocks to invest in.At times he goes a little too quickly in his explanations but the joy of having it on CD is that you can listen to in over and over during your mindnumbing commute.I do not agree with his recommendation that you should invest in only 5-10 stocks whic his far too few but htat being disregarded this book is a must for all investors. I guarentee that you will reduce the chances of losing money if you follow his suggestions.Oh............if you find him too iritating on TV don't worry he has toned it down on the CD.
4,Great,Jim Cramer is the best - his stock tips and philosophy of investing is truly outstanding.Thanks Jim for all of your insight!
3,"Read ""Sane Investing"" instead","This book is ok, and I have been a huge Cramer fan since 1998, but his book from a few years ago titled ""Sane Investing in an Insane World"" is much, much better than this one. This one basically rehashes the same stuff and isn't as well-written."
3,"OK, but all the same stuff he says already","This book has good info in it, and I love his TV & radio show, but he basically tells you to NOT invest for many more reasons than TO invest.This book, or any book by Kramer is NOT for anyone that can risk losing anything unless you're very young. Older people can NEVER recover from a huge market dip or a disaster and he tells you this.If you can only own ONE of Kramers books, this might not be it unless you want to jump right in and throw money around (this book will save you from being a moron that way). Better books for some people might be financial lifestyle-change books like from Dave Ramsey (Spend less, use cash always & dont use credit, dont buy things you know nothing about like computers and HDTVs and gadgets, negotiate lower prices, buy used cars, get in a Roth instead of 401k, etc). Great 2nd or 3rd book for your Jim Kramer collection"
3,Just so so in the series by Cramer,This book piggybacks on the other books by Cramer and in my opinion the least informational and educational. He simply re-iterates what he writes about in his other books. It leaves me wondering when the other books are so well written and actually pass along useful investing information how this one was approved. As it was written with a second author I wonder how much Cramer was actually involved with the writing of this particular book. The one thing that the book does re-enforce is that you must always do your homework on your investments but then again this is not a new concept from Cramer.
3,Just as entertaining as the show,"This is a good read. It's the only Cramer book I have and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The book is not that long, around 200 pages, but does provide some good information. I did notice that Cramer spends a lot of time repeating himself and spending time telling you what he is going to do instead of just doing it. A fair amount of fluff, but nonetheless a very entertaining book. I always enjoy watching Mad Money for the info and entertainment value and this book held my interest and was fun and easy to read."
1,ugghhh...,so the most annoying human in history had someone else ghost-write a book for him? sounds great...
5,Worth Every Penny,i bought this book expecting the same old tired investment advice but man was i wrong. cramer is the man! do yourself a huge favor and get this book trust me you will thank me. BOOYAH!
1,Outright anihilation starts with this point of view.,TV is a distraction and an addiction - just as is the polarity of this reality fed by crap like this. Let's put the author on a polygraph and let me ask him questions.
2,Just be careful,"There is an old saying that ""a rising tide floats all boats""... which applies to JC. Many of JC's picks have been good lately, but the whole market has been good, and like a boat, the tide is carrying his picks up with the whole market. But to be sure, he has had many bad picks also.The new book (which I actually have) is which is about 60 pages less then the prior book and is mainly a repeat of the other book.If you are a fan of JC then ...""BUY BUY BUY""If you're not a fan of JC then .... ""DON'T BUY DON'T BUY"""
1,Same old stuff,I looked the book over at Borders. It's virtually the same as his previous book. I have followed him in the past but I find I do better on my own. Has anyone noticed that his own portfolio (Action Alerts) is trailing the S&P500? His trust gained 6.50% while the S&P gained 12.19%. I paid almost 400 bucks for very subpar results. He's in the biz for himself- not for you.
5,Great Financial Book,"I got this book for Christmas and I am thrilled that my kids thought of me when they saw this book. This is my first Cramer book and I am considering picking up at least another one.This book is an easy read with plenty of great information. Some of the information he covers are topics that he does not have time to cover on television. Cramer also gives us an inside peak at some of the inner workings of the show.Cramer is a terrific entertainer on a topic that most don't find as entertaining.What makes his book and insights different from other finaincial writers is that Cramer has a backgrond of being in the game. He has a successful track record of running a hedge fund for many years and prior to that working at Goldman Sachs, the highest profile firm on the street."
3,A nice companion to the TV show,"The book helps to decipher some of the terminology used on the show and gives the reader a ready reference guide for ""homework."
1,Save your money,"Totally useless. I bought it to find out what the hype was about. What I found was hot air. I couldn't even find the hype.Don't buy. Sell, sell, sell. If you base your investment decision based on his books, then you are really mad."
2,"Cramer is Out, Schiff 's Crash Proof is In!","Although helpful, Watch TV is an average follow up to his previous excellent efforts. It is not insightful enough to help readers make money during down periods - like the market is in now. I would recommend Peter Schiff's book ""Crash Proof"" as the new direction for serious investors and traders...Schiff's work the new mantra, Jim Cramer's is fading..."
4,It's a book,Not much can be said for a book. I like cramer his info is helpful. The book arrived in good shape and quick. I would recommend it.
1,"Lots of hype, little content","I listened to the audio version of this book. Or at least I tried to. The first 30 minutes were completely hype. No content whatsoever. I got so tired of his voice, the way he talks, and all the hype that I couldn't continue the book. Sorry. I hear his earlier books were better."
3,It's okay,Please read Rule 1 investor by Phil Town instead of this book!!!It makes so much more sense and made me a lot of money!
5,"Jim Cramer's Mad Money: Watch TV, Get Rich",I actually purchased this book for my boyfriend. He is in the middle of reading it and loves it!
2,Buyer Beware,"Jim is entertaining...as is this book. While this book includes some good information, you need to be careful with this guy. He is a self promoting entertainer who knows something about the market and stock trading. His hit rate is not as good as his screened callers (loyal followers) would have you believe. He's been tracked to be no better than other self proclaimed gurus. He has made some awful calls he would sooner forget about - SIRI, Dick's, Whole Foods, the list goes on. All that said, if you are careful, and don't rely on Cramer for your specific finance investment decisions, you just may make a few bucks in the market. Jim's positive attitude is great, but utilization of his own advice has yielded him less than great results...in my humble opinion."
2,Sales pitch for his show,"Not impressed, seemed to be nothing more than a sales pitch for himself and his show.Read like a rap song, how great he is. If you have to sell yourself that hard, you have self-esteem issue.Can get the same tips by just watching his show. But then, what would you expect from someone on CNN."
5,"Jim Cramer's Mad Money: Watch TV, Get Rich",The product delivery was good. The product was what was advertised. The price for the product was good. No problems or issues.
3,Only focuses on MAJOR hikes,I thought this book could be more comprehensive. It certainly covers a lot but focuses mostly on the major trails that are often crowded during the 'official climbing season'. The new Lonely Planet Hiking in Japan is a far better bang for your buck.
3,A little cheap,"No pictures, and the maps are very basic. Was hoping for a little more comparison of the hikes...you really won't know what you're hiking until you're out there."
5,All the reasons you love Queen bundled right into this dvd!,"Covers the greats of their early career and even has extras like ""Good Old fashioned Lover Boy"" which is one of my favorite Queen songs! I would highly recommend this DVD, I am now getting them in order :)"
1,"Queen never sounded so good, but never looked so BAD!!","The 5.1 audio remasters are wonderful. However, for some insane reason the videos have been matted to create a false widescreen presentation for 16:9 TVs. (In other words, they took the original videos created for normal TVs and covered up the tops and bottoms with black bars to make them look widescreen.) By doing this, they have cut off the tops of heads and feet throughout the videos!The videos in this collection were all created for normal TV broadcasts before widescreen TV even existed. Butchering these classic videos so badly just so they can fill the screen of a new TV format is unforgivable.If you wanted this collection because you loved these videos when they originally aired years ago, I recommend renting it first to see if you can tolerate the matting. Buyer beware!"
2,The early videos dont really help the music,"Queen's music is much stronger than their early videos. Most were poorly produced, or they used technology that severely dated the material. Most of the videos here have not been cleaned up and, quite frankly, look awful on modern televisions. And, since the videos are not groundbreaking or relevant to their music, they don't really matter much.With that said, it is still an interesting look into how the band changed over the years, and its a chance to hear some great songs that never get airplay (such as Spread Your Wings). The commentary is good at times, but at others it is simply boring. In addition, it appears Roger and Brian did the commentary, while old interview clips from John are just dropped in... as if he were sitting there commenting too.Perhaps the most distracting thing about this DVD is the main menu and the painful way you have to scroll through each song before you get to the one you want."
3,Queen - Greatest Video Hits 1,"Back in October 2002, I first bought this dvd. I was in awe when I watched it. To me it was pretty rare. At that time I had been a Queen fan for about a almost 2 years. I thought this was really excellent. But then I went on the internet and there are so much more rare videos. Like the early videos from the actually good albums.I've only seen a few pictures of the videos, but they are pretty good. What the creators of this dvd should do is make a dvd with all the complete videos. That's a 5 disc collection, that would rock. They should also officaly release the Queen concerts. Instead of all these bootlegs and everything. Well all in all I'll give this 4/5 stars. They have the main videos, but not a lot of the early ones. Long live Queen."
5,"1 out of 10? 21, ha ha","This is a awsom DVD. If you buy it you will not regret it. I bought it the day it came out and have not stopped watching it. I love it. You get to watch the masters of music, and music videos. THe greastest video hits is the best you buy this and you will not regret it, no you will not. I bought it and it was way better than i thought it would be, and i thought it would be AWSOM!!!"
1,WORST SOUND SINCE EDISON TURNTABLE,"I really don't recommend this Queen DVD, is like to hear music in an old AM radio. I have a state of the art system and for a group characterized for the power and quality of their recordings, this is no what you are looking for."
5,Extraordinary,"I bought this DVD as a birthday gift for my cousin in the first place, played it once and bought another for myself the next day.It`s totally awesome, a wonderful archive for anyone who is interested in Queen music."
3,There Is A Lot More Early Music Videos!,"C'mon, this is a okay collection of their main videos, butthere is a lot more videos. Some are early BBC tv apperanceslike LIAR, KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE, there is different versionsof Boheminan Rhapsody, their is Stone Cold Crazy, there isSeven Seas Of Rhye, their is live shows too.But I don't think they will ever release Queen's earlyconcerts on dvd. Like THE RAINBOW, THE HAMMERSMITH, HYDEPARK, SOME JAZZ CONCERTS, SOME NOTW CONCERTS & HAMMERSMITH#2. This really upsets me.But other than then that, this is a 3/5 video collection.They cleared up the picture & made the sound more clear.This could have been better."
3,Watch out - the image has been butchered,"For some reason, they decided to reframe all videos to widescreen - thus cutting away top and bottom of the image - not realising that widescreen TVs and discs were created to maintain the ORIGINAL frame ratio of movies.I thought it would not matter in a music release, but it is quite noticeable, and damages what would otherwise be a perfect DVD.I will NOT buy the second disc if they do the same."
