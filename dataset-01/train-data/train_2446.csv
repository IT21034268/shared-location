1,I think we all should boycott this!,"You know I was all for a little spit and polish on these movies back in 1997, but this has gotten crazy. I don't mind adding a few CG elements here and there: cloud city, Mos Eisley, Dewbacks, but when the original movie is significantly altered with the special editions, the 2004 DVD's, and now this, it's gotten out of hand.No one should ever take classic movies and delete original footage, significantly alter footage ""Han/Greedo, fake CG Jabba, CG dancers, deletion of original Anakin, or add new dialogue, NOOOOOOOOOOOO!. Plus whatever minor changes are made, always include for the fans the original unaltered versions.I don't really know what can be done to stop this butchering of these movies. Please release originals and have a version that has CG elements that doesn't alter the original concept.GEEZ!"
1,"At long last, the Ewoks FINALLY have eyelids of their own!","Bless you, George Lucas, in all your benevolent glory, for finally granting the deserving Ewoks the gift of blinking. Their unwavering devotion to the great and all-powerful deity that is yourself has paid off at last. Again, I say ""bless you, kind sir!"""
1,dammit george,"take a note from Blade Runner and E.T.......give us the ORIGINALS along with your ""i'm totally making them better by adding useless stuff with each release"" versions.I'm not going to harp on the ""NOOOOOO"" because others have mentioned how awful awful awful it is.Ewoks blinking? You really thought that was necessary? the CGI looks weird and pulls you out of the movie. stop it george."
1,just say NOOO!,I'm just lending my voice to the cause. Please boycott this product to show that Lucas' changes are unacceptable. I've already cancelled my pre-order.
5,The complete collection.,Loved every moment of the movies. Although I do recommend you watch them in the original order. Never owned the originals so having them on bluray will make a great addition to my collection.
4,STAR WARS BLU-RAY FOR EVERYONE BUT STILL NEED FIXs,"All six movies were great especially in HD. Episodes 1-6 was awesomes in HD. All the films looked better and I was impress with new affects made to it. I didn't mind the changes in episode IV and VI. But they shoulda have fixed all the lightsaber in episode 4-6. In episode IV, they should have fixed luke's saber better when he was on the falcon and fix the obi-won saber when he was facing darth vader. Same thing for Episode V. Other than that, the films would have looked great."
1,Fail,"Nice try Lucas. I will not put a PENNY in your wallet for the bastardized versions of episodes IV, V, VI. See what they did with Blade Runner? Now THAT was a great Blu-Ray release. I will not be buying anything Star Wars until the true originals are available. Late 70's - early 80's special effects mixed with CGI? FAIL!"
2,How Long Before The Next Boxed Versions?,"Guess what I saw at the movies yesterday? Give up? Previews for the upcoming rereleases of the ""Star Wars"" films in 3D. How long do you think it will be before the films are once again repackaged and offered to the viewing public in brilliant Blu-ray 3D? Having purchased the videotapes, laserdiscs, and DVDs over the years, I would really like to see George Lucas stop milking his franchise for every last possible penny and possibly direct something (anything) to show us that he has what it takes to be considered a great director."
3,Should have just got original Trilogy,"The added Vader ""Noooo"" at the end of Jedi was just horrible. But then there are many things about the last third of Jedi that bother me. I bought this edition for the deleted scenes and documentaries, but honestly the scenes are on youtube and the fan documentaries Star Wars Begins, Building Empire, and Returning to Jedi, all available for free are the best docs I've seen on the movies.The new movies have some parts I like- all the Obi bits are good in my opinion, but I found myself fast forwarding through the ""Annie"" and Padme parts because I still find them horrible.It may be my imgaination, but certain background elements in the old trilogy seem enhanced or added to. Things have more color, or style, or come fancy holo terminal will be there when there wasn't one before, etc.I would have been happy just getting the original trilogy on blu-ray. The extras aren't worth it in my opinion."
1,Big disapointment,"Who didn't love the original Star Wars movies? Lucas has steadily ruined them against his own fans/customer's wishes and the latest Blu-ray release with it's 'improvements' only added insult to injury after promised corrections that never came.It's bad enough were stuck with Jar Jar, yet various other key scenes remain edited and ruined, or only fixed partially with a single frame fixed out of several giving a sloppy impression of the editing that was done.Given their track record, there will probably be yet another 1-2 more Blu-ray box set releases yet none will ever truly be fixed or give the series back to the fans."
5,STAR WARS BLURAY BOXSET,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS-BUY IT!!!I HAVE OWNED THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY ON EVERY FORMAT SINCE THE 80'S.THIS BLU-RAY SET TAKES IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.A+ ALL THE WAY!!!! PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY LIKE NEVER BEFORE.
1,I never fully understood the disappointment...until now.,"Let me just sum up what other disappointed fans are saying here by quoting the immortal words of another George:""And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed-if all records told the same tale-then the lie passed into history and became truth. 'Who controls the past' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past"" (Orwell, 1984, Chapter 3).Pretty much a perfect summary of what Lucas is doing, isn't it? My plan at this point is to track down the originals on DVD or VHS and forget about buying any new versions unless Lucas finally sees fit to do what he should have done in the first place and release the theatricals on high definition.Darth Vader's not-so-great new scene in ROTJ is what did it for me. That scene was one of my favorites. It was so powerful before. Now it's just corny.Enough is enough!"
1,This could have been awesome...,"Too bad George Lucas can't leave well enough alone. I was very excited for this Blu Ray set, but I have been forced to cancel my pre-order (which I placed on the day that the set was announced) because of the proposed changes that Lucas is making to the films. As the reviews are showing, I am not the only person disappointed with Lucas/Lucasfilms' decision to alter the films for the Blu Ray release. Let Lucasfilm take note. However, it will be too little too late. I won't be buying any future Star Wars box sets or special releases or whatever."
1,Just Stop it George...,"George Lucas took one of the most hated lines from the prequels and added it to the original trilogy... Its almost as if hes doing this to spite the fans. Do not buy this. Instead, just find some nice fan edits somewhere & watch those."
1,Disappointed,"I really was looking forward to this release until I started reading all of the negative comments. I wanted to watch the original trilogy with my kids in HD. I cancelled my order upon the recommendations of other reviewers. With this much controversy, hopefully something better will be released in the future. I am not the biggest fan of Star Wars although I did enjoy the films. If I am going to spend this much on a set of movies, I would prefer to avoid disappointment."
1,I've seen the changes myself. Don't get ripped off!,"More changes have been made to our once beloved trilogy.Lucas is out of control. It's obvious he doesn't have a gift when it comes to subtlety and he has a profound lack of respect for the work he and others have done. He is not a professional and he is not a filmmaker. He is a salesmen.Here is what you get for $90:- The PT. Three of the worst films to have come out during the last decade.- The Phantom Menace, complete with horrid picture quality, making Maul and Qui-Gon out to be wax statues!- The hackjobs that are the Special EditionsSave your money. Don't buy this product."
1,I will not purchase this because there is no unaltered version.,"Huge star wars fan here and I will not be purchasing this watered down, cgi infested abomination. These are no longer the movies I grew up loving. I would rather watch my old unremastered versions on dvd then this special edition garbage on blue-ray."
1,Why can't we just have the ORIGINAL movies?,All I want is the original movies remastersed so they look good enough on Blu-Ray. Is that asking so much?
2,"Unlike most people, I actually bought it and am disappointed.","Let me start by saying that the prequels, look really good. And that's what this is a 2 star.BUT the originals...are terribly doneFirst off, it's not true HD. In fact most of it looks standard. Secondly in A New Hope, during the escape from the death star, where Luke and Han are shooting the TIE fighters. The fighters have a little brown box around them on several frames, AND during one frame it actually goes back to FULL screen, from widescreen. Then while Luke is about to destroy the death star, one of the tie fighters there, actually is transparent somehow lol. Luke's lightsaber still changes color twice. AND Obi-Wan's does as well during the fight with Vader it turns purple several times.I'm actually really considering returning this. In fact I probably will."
5,Love this movie,This product is great. I love all of the state of the art additions that Lucas made to make the movies even better than the originals!
1,I would give it Zero Starz if I Could,This set DOES NOT contain the Theatrical Releases.. So why the world would I spend my money on a set thats not really complete as they claim it to be???
1,Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!,Pre-order cancelled.Why? Lucas has ruined one of the seminal moments in the original trilogy with a ridiculous cry. I'd rather have a straight across transfer of the special edition dvds than these new blu-rays.Pity.
1,No OT = No Sale,This is terrible. I want the original unaltered movies on Blu-Ray. I'm not buying Star Wars on Blu-Ray until they are made available.
1,lucas has ZERO understanding of what made the movies great,"The first star wars was great. I remember seeing it at the drive-in theater numerous times. Star wars in general had a huge impact on my childhood. Then empire...darker, more mature, growing with me as I hit my early teens. Then Jedi, when I gave up the toys but appreciated Leia in her slave outfit. I hated the ewoks, but loved everything star wars none-the-less. Then the new movies, which were a major let down. Somehow, I managed to forgive him. But now, with this Blu-ray release, and the years of destroying, one perfect moment at a time, everything that made star wars for me, I am calling it quits, and the man behind the legacy a moron."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! The Star Wars Legacy has come to an end on this Blu-Ray Edition,"A foolish friend of mine bought the Blu-Ray set this morning. I just watched Jedi with him, and I must say all of the negative reviews are valid. The movie is ruined with all the changes, and additions. Return of the Jedi has completely lost its impact, and atmosphere from the 1983 original. BUYER BEWARE!! I'm just making this opinion from watching it, and now I wish I hadn't. It can never be unseen. This is a horrible act of artistic vandalism. I wish George Lucas would have just done this at home for his own entertainment, and left the fans with what they truly wanted. What a shame."
1,I agree with the rest...,"Without the unaltered versions I will not be buying this set. I have a copy of the THX VHS tapes and a set of the bonus discs from the DVD release and this is just going to have to hold me over until they release a proper version of the original three. Star Wars came on tv the other day but it was the 'special edition' and I just couldn't watch it. All the extra crap running around just ruins it. Don't get me started on Jabba, ugh he just looks bad in episode 4."
4,Star Wars the complete saga,I do like the 6.1 dts on all the blu ray discs. It gave me a whole new sound on my sound system and besides the Star Wars episode are all classics.
2,GEORGES BUTCHER SHOP,"Dear mister Lucas. I am wondering if you would come to our home this Thanksgiving and butcher our turkey, like you butchered this. What a disappointment, after waiting so long for the Blue Ray version. Just one question. Why ? Mr Lucas, please remember the old saying for future projects like this. If it aint broken, don't fix it."
1,The films have been altered,"The films have been altered from their original theatrical versions. In addition to changes such as Darth Vader's ""No Nooo"", the pale lightsaber effects introduced in an earlier altered release have not been corrected to their original state."
1,Just Terrible,"An abortion of a classic.Please stop now Lucas. You've done enough bad, and yet you keep doing more and more.All we want is DVD's or Blu Ray of the original, unedited version of the film."
1,Shame on George Lucas,"I am a huge Star Wars fan of the Old movies 4 - 6 and I will not be buying these DVD's. George Lucas changed to many key scenes.When he wants to do it right, then I might get them.Again, SHAME ON GEORGE LUCAS!!!!"
1,No classic Versions = No Purchase,"George, read all the negative reviews. You are missing out on lots of $$'s. Put out the classic versions. I'll never buy the hacked up versions you have here."
1,Casting my vote for a lower rating.,"Sadly I don't think George Lucas will care what we think, if he did, he might have used some restraint. There are still serious mistakes INTRODUCED in the CGI additions to the series that he hasn't fixed. (just look at R2 in Luke's x-wing before entering the atmosphere of Dagobah, and you'll see this horrible CGI error in R2's 'eye', and how the death star could have fired and destroyed all the fighters and the fourth moon because someone decided that the CGI moon should be added to the new shot of the fighters coming towards us, then panning 180 degrees to see the Death Star... 1, 2, 3.... FIRE! End of series.George should just remake Star Wars, and leave the originals alone if he wants so many changes.D"
1,Han shot first!,"It's not just a little quibble - it's a key element of the character's personality - when someone is waving a gun in your face, saying they're going to kill you now, finger on the trigger - you don't wait! It makes Han Solo the character he is - not the idealized hero that always lets the bad guy get the first shot in.I don't care about all the updates to the graphics, I can even deal with Jabba allowing Han to walk on his tail without ordering him killed - but to change Han's character like that - it's a substantial and major part of the film. Without that - no sale. Not ever."
1,Serious Plastic Surgery,"I am pretty sure that this is the Joan Rivers of Star Wars releases. There has been so much tweaking and pasting that you are left wondering if the films were ever any good. Why do they keep trying to ""fix"" them? How much more nip/tucking can they do until the films are unrecognizable. If you can resist the extra features, do not buy this set. Lucas needs to release the original movies like we all want. That I would pay for. Not this. Lame! I feel so sorry for the generation who will only have this to watch and never saw the groundbreaking original releases. If this version was the one I had seen originally, I would not be a Star Wars fan."
1,Nooooooooooooooooooo,All I can say is NOooooooooooooooooooooooo...not another tinker of a classic. Get rid of the cheesy revised versions and stick with the original.
2,"Disappointing, wait for the real release","Pros+ Films look and sound great (better than previous releases of course)+ Simple, but nice box set+ Price on Amazon is a great deal compared to other retailers, so if you buy it you should get it hereCons- As others mentioned, the original versions of the original trilogy are not included- 'Bonus feature' discs are terrible, it takes about 30 seconds to get from the main menu to a single deleted scene, takes almost the same time to go from one deleted scene to another... I could not find a way to ""Play All""- All of the deleted scenes I watched were garbage, Youtube quality video, most are shorter than the time it takes to switch from one deleted scene to the next so most of your time is spent in the superfluous menusI would not buy it again, and I was planning on buying it as a gift for a couple of diehard fans this Christmas - not anymore."
1,No Digital Copy? For all that money?,"Don't buy the movie until they have the digital codes for download. We are moving into the new era of tablets without DVD's. Come on George, give us a break!!!"
2,Originals please,"At 5 years old I was fortunate to see episode 4 in the theater in 1977. Although not perfect, I thought it was. The story and characters captivated me. My friends and I would act out scene after scene, day after day. We traded Star Wars cards, we played with the Star Wars toys, the characters became friends to us. We held our breath for 3 long years for the next movie. And when that day finally came it was better than Christmas. We could finally see for ourselves what did happen to Luke, Leia, Han, Threepio, R2, and Chewbacca. This release has been the biggest letdown. I don't own it and I never will. The original cuts, in restored video and audio, without the new special effects from any era, is that too much to ask for? I would have spent 80 bucks on just those. Lucas just needs to let this series go and move on."
1,That's it,"I'm sitting here stunned that two days before I'd be getting my ultimate dream- the SW movies on Blu-Ray- I've canceled my order. I have been the world's biggest SW fan since my mother took me to the original in its 1978 re-release as a baby. I love the prequels and everything about them, I love the special editions. I'll never understand why the purists can't appreciate that there's more to SW than ""what I remember as a kid"" and ""cool scary bad***es like Darth Maul"".Now having said that, I watched the new Darth Vader ""Nooooo!"" on YouTube and am appalled. It is heinous and egregious. I'm very angry. But I'm proud to be joining this boycott.-The World's Biggest Star Wars Fan"
1,more changes...,"more changes... same old bad changes... this is how you turn a good thing bad... The worst part is the musical at the beginning of return of the jedi.... followed by the added ""noooo"" when vadar saves luke. its bad. worse then the digitally inserted Mannequin Skywalker..."
4,The thrill is back!!,"We waited a long time, but the wait was well worth it. Great picture quality and terrific sound make the Star Wars saga a must-own. Lucas takes us on a trip across the universe that excites the senses. If the dialog gets a little hokey, marvel at the background images. See a whole new world while watching Star Wars on Blu-Ray. You'll be glad you did!!"
3,Movies were what i expected,"My 3 star review is not for the movies them self, but the quality of the package when i received it. The shipping box was in perfect condition, but the bluray box was damaged, pretty bad, which means that it was damaged before it was packaged and shipped."
5,Christmas,Bought this for my fiancé for Christmas and it was a huge hit for the whole family! There are 3 more discs with extras on them that he almost cried about!
4,Love the movie. Hate all the encryptions that make it almost impossible to play,"Love Star Wars. The only thing that I'm sad about and hoping maybe someone has some advice for me. I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas. He loved it!!! That's not the problem. The problem is with all this encrypting they are doing with Blu-ray discs, there are some we have not been able to play on our Blu-ray player without paying an arm and a leg every time to upgrade the software we've already paid for, to be able to watch them. Our Blu-ray player is in our computer. It makes me upset that if when we buy a movie and it's encrypted we cannot watch it. I don't understand why every time we want to play a new Blu-ray we also have to pay to upgrade the software to watch something we've already paid for?"
2,Same as it ever was,"This is typical tyrannical behaviour from director's. Another egregious example of tampering with a classic is Amadeus. Where is there an original theatrical release to be found (laser disc, VHS). Lucas and Milos Forman must've attended the same ""lets' mess up the original"" Oscar winning classics we, the PAYING audience cherished."
1,Darth Lucas must be destroyed,"I grew up being a huge fan of Star Wars and George Lucas, but his constant marketing and merchandising games are despicable. How many times do these movies need to be released and re-released before he finally listens to the fans?"
1,Just say NNOOOOooooooo.....,"The new Darth Vader says NOOoooo has ruined one of the most powerfull scenes in all of the Star Wars movies.George has often said that movies aren't finished, they're just abandoned, well George it's time to let go, you should have left these movies abandoned years ago.I would love to vote with my wallet and not buy this BD set but that's a message that's not going to get through and besides there's so much good stuff on this that I want to see.I guess I'll buy this and just cringe in discust at the new 'NO' scene along with all the other changes we've had over the years."
1,Whats the best thing to do!!!!,"1. I love Star Wars and am fine with George changing HIS movies but I also want the Original Theatrical versions, all other movies that have changes in them are released with originals and remakes so why cant George do the same, its real simple, change all you want just release the originals with it. SIMPLE!!!!2. These reviews that people are posting here are for this product even though its not released yet because we know from Georges own site what they are being released with and that is NO ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSIONS. Once again its simple, release originals with your changed versions.3. I give this one star because George should release the Original Theatrical versions in the best quality available on this Blu Ray set, its simple, JUST RELEASE IT THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSIONS!!!!!"
3,Great set but!,"First off let me just preface this by saying I'm glad to have these on Blu-ray. The picture looks fantastic and the sound is the best I've heard in a long time.Now the one and only complaint and it's a big one-those bonus discs! the first two have technical coding problems which make them freeze up or in the best case appear choppy.I did the firmware upgrade thinking it would resolve the issue but it did not. I returned the set 4 times to Best Buy hoping that would take care of it, but it did not. out of the 4 I returned 1 did not even have the booklet in it! There are some serious quality control issues with this set. I'll be contacting the 800 number tomorrow to find out more. be warned if you buy this set these problems may be there."
1,They did it with the Godfather,"Lucas could take a hint from his friend Coppala. The Godfather trilogy on blu-ray with its original theatrical release was not cleaned up, but restored. Lucas, do a restoration to the original trilogy for us. A good film to watch in the dark in its original glory. Part of being in this business is giving your fans and the people what they want. Cameron did it as well with the Alien release. Your other friend Steven did it with Encounters of the third kind. ITS NOT HARD. Include ALL versions, for everyone. YOu will make a HUGE amount more money."
3,waiting for this with DVD and digital copy included,Waiting for this with DVD and digital copy included. When that happens it will be added to my wishlist. Mos def.
5,Awesome!!!,"I'm excited, so what if Vader says one word .... it may be cheesy but it shouldn't impact everyone's love for the franchise. People that say they hate it are doing so only for attention as if they are this effected by a few minor changes in some movies, they have issues deeper then Darth Vader yeling ""No!"".It'll be pretty cool. I'm sure all the complainers will be enjoying the hi-def remake as much as everyone else."
1,"Please stop, George Lucas...","George isn't done stomping all over your childhood fantasies just yet, ladies and gentlement. While the picture and sound may be the best yet for the series, Lucas once again makes ridiculous changes to the original trilogy (who cares what he does with the prequels... They're awful) that need not be made. George, for the sake of Star Wars fans everywhere, please just stop. You've done enough."
1,Boycott,"One of the definitions of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome than before. DON'T buy this crap in the hope that Lucas will finally get some sense and put out the product people want. So long as people keep shelling out money for new versions of Star Wars minus the original cuts, just so we can get the few new extras he cynically adds each time, he will continue to pull this moneygrabbing crap and withhold what everyone really wants. Lucas: ""Come back to me baby. I won't hurt you again!"" Right answer: ""No"". Wrong answer: ""OK, baby. I'm sure you'll be different this time because you WANT to change."""
2,Wanting the original versions,"Do I want the movies to go to blu-ray? Yes. Do I want the new ""better"" versions? No. I liked the movies the way they were before Lucas ""enhanced"" them, thereby eliminating the appeal for me.Will I buy these on blu-ray? No. Not without the original versions. I have the originals on DVD--and even threw out the ""enhanced"" versions, in favor of the ones I saw when I was a kid.So, until Lucas changes his mind (what little there is of it--he's a nut, if you ask me), I will not migrate to blu-ray for these inferior versions--even if they are on blu-ray. I'll stick to the old tried-and-true versions--where Han shot first--and YES, I care about that, because having Greedo shoot first totally alters Han's image--for the worse.So you go ahead & go for the blu-ray. Even if the quality isn't at the top of the heap for the old ones, I'll stick with them instead."
1,A slap in the face for fans,"Wow, so I can only get the complete OT extra features if I give you money for the prequels? No thanks, Mr. Lucas.Let me know when you release the original forms of the classic movies I love. Until then, I have my laserdisc copies."
3,Worth The Wait,"I love the star wars series don't get me wrong, however, if you want me to buy this on Blu-Ray, lower that price a bit, and add some digital copies to the film. I wish to have spent this amount of money and still be able to enjoy it on my iPod you know. And since they are re-releasing Star Wars I in 3D, don't be surprised if they make a complete 3D saga set."
1,Disgusting!!!,This is abhorrent. Lucas should buy the Mona Lisa and add some more paint to it every couple of weeks. I hear in the 3D version that the unmasked Darth Vader will now be a black guy. There are many more changes than people think. There are so many ridiculous additions in the scenes leading up to the bar scene that its unwatchable. I couldn't get through the Episode IV. This will stay in a drawer somewhere and go down as a waste of money. I won't even bother to watch V & VI (Noooooooooo). I-III are made for TV junk anyway. Hayden Christenson was horrible to start but gets worse every time you see it again. Those 3 are were ruined beyond repair the moment Lucas decided to direct them.Anyway that is getting off topic. This is ridiculous. Worse than Woodstock on Bluray in which they re-mixed the songs adding new music from the kids of the musicians 40years after the fact.
1,Sacrilegious,"This is the last straw. Lucas has found another way of just trying to cash in, all the while destroying our childhood memories. If he had the decency of including and restoring the original film without any alteration, it would be worth a buy. As it stands, he only wants your money."
3,Original Theatrical Version,if your gonna do all these changes at least put the Original Theatrical Versions on blue ray short selling everyone on this
1,"100%cpu usage, stutters, playback probs with latest CPU","I would not purchase this unless you have the PS3. If you are planning on trying this with any older hardware its going to drag down your system and impossible playback problems, good luck if you want to try the kitchen sink. Pretty poor release to junk buyers with older blu ray players."
1,Another piece of my childhood dies,"G.L. has no moral compass, and I am convinced he is doing this just to troll his fans. Part of me respects what a blatant jerk he is, but most of me resents him for making Star Wars embarrassing."
1,Star Wars on Blu-ray: It's a trap!,I bet you're rethinking the logic behind putting a bottomless hole in your throne room NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW! Always loved Vader's wordless self sacrifice. Another clueless revision like Greedo and young Anakin's ghost.
1,Super-mega-ultra-dumb,"I haven't slept for 10 days after finding out about the most recent changes to the original Star Trek Trilogy. In my marathon of sleeplessness I managed to eke out a modest haiku.I will not buy these.CGI is super lame.Lucas has no neck.It took 6 out of the last 10 days to write that, but I think it sums up the situation rather perfectly, wouldn't you say? The only other thing that I'm kind of mad about besides this whole Vader screams ""Noooo"" thing, is the fact that 3 out of the 4 local stores by my house won't sell me gold spray paint, Sudafed, or Crazy Glue anymore. Whatevs."
1,Sorry but no!!,"I will not be buying these so called Star Wars Films. Even though I would love to have them on Blu-ray, The changes that were made and the new changes are completely laughable.Not matter the limitations of the 70's and 80's, the films were great as they were. I am sad for Lucas thinking he has to change his films.I do not recommend anyone buy these on Blu-ray."
1,The Definitive Collection Laserdisc is still superior,"For the sole reason that it still is the ""definitive"" version. It has the best picture of an unaltered release which is sad to the say the least.I was ready to buy the Blu Ray collection even with Han shooting first until I heard of Darth Vader yelling ""NOOOOOO"" at the end of RTOJ.I'm definitely not a fanboy, but I refuse to buy these as long as Lucas has slung even more abuse upon ""his"" films.Instead of bowdlerization of books as in the 19th century, we have ""lucasization"" of landmark films."
3,Don't know what Lucas was thinking,"I loved the first three films (IV-VI), but the prequels absolutely atrocious. And blu-ray does them no favors. Absolute garbage film(green-screen)making. I should have just bought the original pack and not this Complete Saga version."
3,Offer The ORIGINAL Versions TOO,"Mr. Lucas could offer the original versions along with his (evolving) revisions if he had a scintilla of regard for those who bought the tickets, watched the film, and loved it for what it was/is. YES, Mr. Lucas (as Mr. Spielberg said) is perfectly within his whims to alter, revise, ""improve"" these films, but Spielberg happens to feel that he can listen to feedback after all, and respects the integrity of the ORIGINAL film. So we WILL get the original versions of the Indiana Jones, E.T. and Jurassic Park film on Blu-ray. So I imagine I could very well still enjoy in competently rendered high definition this Blu-ray release. But I share Spielberg's view on the matter. I will not lose sleep over it, but Mr. Lucas, why not offer the original cuts and your insecure and impractical revisions together in this set?"
1,STOP CHANGES!,"Cancelled my pre-order today. As a fan of the original movies, it kills me when Lucas adds in extras to a movie just because he feels it makes it ""better"". Yes, it's his property and he can do with it what he wants, but it still doesn't mean he SHOULD. Adding in Christensen at the end of ROTJ was bad enough in the DVD release, now adding in another ""Noooooo!"", CGI eyelids and a terrible redo of the Krayt Dragon call seals, or rather unseals, the deal on buying the blu-ray edition. As a fan of the Original trilogy, please George, release the original, unaltered versions of the movies on Blu-Ray. I won't fall for this bait and switch(adding deleted scenes while altering established ones). AND HAN SHOT FIRST!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A Disgrace To The Originals,Will not purchase this due to the changes that were made...this is like going back and touching up a classic book or painting..simply unbelievable. Will stick to the up-converted DVD version until the original versions are released.
1,No. Nooooo.,"I'd appreciate simply taking the original movie, cleaning them up visually to HD crispness, AND THAT'S IT! This time they've added to the CG adulteration and the addition of Vader yelping ""nooooo"" as he tosses the Emperor. All this does, other than to turn classic into corny, is to remind us that whatever Lucas was in the 70s and 80s, some kind of mental degeneration has turned him into something else entirely. With every corny, cheap, unimaginative, and tasteless project he's taken up since that original trilogy, he's only worked to sour the legacy of those amazing 3 movies. And now this Blu Ray serves to inflict that onto those movies themselves."
1,You ruined them,"So unlike many other Star Wars fans, I wasn't greatly bothered by the changes made in the 2004 DVD release. Disappointing as they were, they were too minor to ruin such otherwise great movies for me (although the CGI sarlacc was really dumb). However, this release is an entirely different matter. One of the best scenes in Film history where Darth Vader is finally redeemed is completely ruined by the insertion of Darth Vader yelling ""NOOOO"" several times. It messes up the entire suspense of the scene and turns it into nothing but a joke. I don't want the next generation to grow up watching this version which why I urge everyone to rate this set 1 star. Casual fans of the series or parents looking to buy this for their kids need to know that this is not the version to go with. Why can't Lucas just release the remastered originals? I've been a lifelong Star Wars fan and and it looks like I have finally joined the Lucas haters."
1,"WTH, I am with the rest.",I don't think I have even watched all 6 movies. Don't care about Star Wars that much at all but I will rate this product 1 star just to protest with others against releases that don't include originals in them when they need to be there.
1,Pre-order cancelled.,"Even the deleted scenes and the inclusion of the vintage documentaries are not enough to overcome the absurdity of Lucas' insistence with continuing to tinker with the original trilogy.I will remain happy watching my non-anamorphic DVDs on a 4:3 CRT.I wouldn't be surprised if he added Ventress to the cockpit of Dooku's solar sailer and Ahsoka to the padawan scenes. Don't laugh, it will happen.I'm done. I will never spend another cent on any Star Wars related item ever again, unless it's a nice 1080p transfer of the original theatrically released trilogy...hell, I would spend $100 each for those."
1,Another disappointed fan....... :(,"I never review products. This is the exception so I can vent my shared opinion about the mangling of a classic film trilogy.NOT happy with Lucas... he's messed with these movies too many times over the years. The movies I remember as a child are no more. I CANCELLED MY PRE-ORDER!!!!!! I hope others do the same, and opefully George gets the message. I would rate ZERO stars if I could. It's sad to think I will not own these on Blu Ray, I may not even rent them..."
4,It IS worth your money,"To begin with, the complete saga remastered in full HD is a great adquisition. For even hardcore fans like, me it is a lil' disappointing to see no original trilogy without any changes, any way, the changes made to the films make it really good. For example, the animated Yoda for episode 1 is just fantastic. So if you don't mind watching a modern anakin skywalker at the end of episode VI, this might be for you. Finally, if you like watching documentaries and behind-the-secnes stuff, this saga collection is right for you."
2,"Two Episode V disks, but no episode VI","This is the one nicely made set: very cool book, bonus disks, and everything...The only problem it has no Episode VI disk in it, there are two Episode V disks though, maybe someone can count it as some interesting collectors edition, but otherwise pretty useless... :("
1,NOOOoo more changes,"The changes made to the film destroy some of the series brilliant moments. Picture might look slightly better but id rather watch one of the better versions of the film. Bonus material is weak as well. They could of included much more and yet it seems theyre holding back. Probably to include it in a new and ""improved"" version of the blurays theyll want you to buy next year. With a digitally remastered yoda in empire strikes back! Ugh"
1,"Get some help, George.","Therapy and medication might help. Decades later you still obsess over these films and endlessly tweak them, adding cartoon graphics and changing dialogue? You, sir, are hollow. Let go and create something new. I dare you."
1,NO MORE!,"I will not be buying this after the confirmed changes (Vader now says NOOOOO as he destroys the Emperor).I am a true fan of the original series and even though I disagreed with some of the changes George Lucas made for his ""Special Editions"" of the films I came to accept them as his true vision for the films (not my vision, but his vision).Now he has changed his mind and is altering the films yet again. Why? Because he CAN. Artistic integrity has nothing to do with it, the director's vision has nothing to do with it, he's doing it because he has the power to do it.I'm sorry, but this is the end of the line for me guys. Enough is enough. I am drawing a line in the sand on this. I WILL NOT GIVE THIS MAN ANY MORE MONEY FOR THESE BASTARDISED VERSIONS OF THESE CLASSIC FILMS.NO MORE."
1,Gutted,"After 30 of believing in the characters, the vision, and the mythology I can no longer claim to be a Star Wars fan. I am so disappointed in the direction these movies have gone in the last few releases, with the ever misguided tinkering from Lucas.The only thing that can redeem this set, the saga as a whole, and my faith in these once great movies is a re-release of the original trilogy, with cleaned up visuals (no added scenes or effects, just a clean print) and 5.1 audio. Lucas has to be sitting on this because the mid 90's widescreen VHS release was close to this very thing.Such a shame. Lucas should be taking a cue from the awesome Blade Runner blu-ray release from a few years ago. That's how you pay homage to a piece of cinematic history. Not with this heavily modified piece of garbage."
1,Lucas Fails again,Like the other 900+ reviews I am canceling my pre-order JUST because of that added crap. Its horrible. I rather watch the imperfections of the movies I remember when I was a kid and not this NEW CGI or audio that ruins the originals. I hope this blu-ray doesn't sell. If you buy this crap just think of it as a bigger retirement fund for Lucas
1,Was going to buy it but...,"I was excited when I first heard about the release of the movies in HD. Oh how the disappointment set in. I'm holding on to my DVD copy that has a disc with the original on it (although it is from a laser disc master). Please George, for the sake of your fans, give us the originals as seen in the theaters."
3,Three Great & Three Not Great,"This is easy. Episode IV was awesome. Episode V is the best, and Episode VI was also some awesome job of a film, but not as awesome as Episode V. Episode I was terrible except for the Jedi vs. Sith lightsaber battle, but still the rest of the movie sucks. Episode II was quite terrible as well, but the Jedi vs. Sith lightsaber battle was pretty cool. Episode III was easily better than I & II, if only that Jar-Jar Binks doesn't talk at all in the film. Episode III did have some bad acting and some terrible writing, but was a decent film overall.This is a mixed package. Honestly, I'd advise getting Episodes IV - VI on Blu-ray Disc and Episodes I - III on DVD."
5,Great gift for Star Wars fan,This was a gift I got for my husband. I love how compact it is and we were pleasantly surprised that inside was a book with all the disks. Each page had a disk and a scene from the movie that looked like a watercolor painting. My husband also noticed the movie was enhanced and the picture quality has greatly improved. The packaging and the disks are of great quality. We are very happy to add it to our collection of Blue Ray dvds.
1,Don't buy this,"Lucas should clean up the originals and sell them to us. That's what we want. How hard is that? Apparently, very."
5,cool movies,gotta have this dvd set. its the most important movies ever made. i love them for various reasons. all good one.
4,its really cool,"Ok, Darth Vader saying NOOOOO SUCKS, other than that i like the changes, and the sound/video is really nice, definitely a really cool blu-ray set"
1,"Just stop George Lucas, please!","All the changes are unnecessary, sloppy and wrong. Hey Mr. Lucas, how about making something new and original and quit ripping off your fans. Quit tampering with the original 3 movies( the second trilogy is crap so please feel free to do what ever you want, till you're blue in the face). Ill take the original 3 movies on vhs with mono sound rather than watch this crap. I will not be buying anything star wars related. People just you wait, the original theatrical release on blu ray, the 1997 versions on blu ray, the 2004 release on blue ray, all of them will just put more money in George Lucas's pocket. All he will do is release something else star wars related in a few years. NO THANKS!!!!!!"
2,No.,"Nice package and content, and I could care less if he wanted to add his f'd up new versions, but the originals should have been an option and included in the set. It's just ridiculous and offensive to fans. I am not a fan of Lucas, and the best films in this series are the ones he did not direct. We praise the groundbreaking work of the special effects and cinematography. If the original theatrical releases of the original early films were included, this would have been a stellar complete boxed set. Sad and pathetic."
1,What I find most surprising....,"Is that everyone is angry that Lucas messed with yet more scenes from the original trilogy...but that you'd of bought this crap had he not have inserted the 'NOOOOOOO"" in ROTJ?!?!?!?! I love the original SW movies as much as the next guy, but Episodes 1-3 were absolutely freakin' HORRIBLE! All of them. Why would you give that moron another cent of your hard earned money if he's going to force (ha...pun) you to buy those absolutely worthless pieces of garbage??? I mean...I guess you could open up the box and just go ahead and throw them away, but you're still supporting that meglomaniac who refuses to acknowledge how terrible those movies were. YOu're still paying money for them...money that you could use to say...light on fire and then drop in your toilet....I mean...it would be a better, more entertaining use of it... Boycott the whole thing and maybe he'll hire someone to make a 7-9 that can salvage some semblance of this truly fallen franchise."
1,NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,Why must you do this to us George Lucas why? All I wanted was decent versions of the OT. It's not like it's not within your power to produce this for us. I shall never show these versions to my children. I shall dust off my laserdisc player and show them these films as close to how they should have been seen as possible. Damn you George Lucas. Damn you straight to hell.
2,What next? 3-D!,He have wake up and smell the coffee!George Lucas. We know you own these movies. Why make them worst? Keep them when they first came out.
4,A Great Set!,"I understand people are upset because the originals are not included but that should not merit a one-star score for this blu-ray set. These copies look and sound fantastic! I've seen the original cuts and prefer the updated versions much more. Sure, consider my opinion bias for being born in '91 and spoiled on CG my whole life but technology has changed the past 30+ years. The original trilogy is still timeless, Jar-Jar is still annoying and shrill, AotC is still terrible, the rock R2 is hiding behind DOES disappear, the Ewoks do have eyelids, Vader's lightsaber is NOT pink, Darth Vader does say ""NOOOOO"" at the end of RotJ, and, yes, Greedo still shots first. But who really cares? The integrity of the movies are still there as well as the magic that keeps me coming back for more! All the bonus material is really cool as well. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the missing documentaries from the DVD's. Other than that, buy this set!"
5,Star wars Complete sage delivers,"I had no idea how much I would enjoy watching all six in the correct order and it was amazing. The first 3, non original, were actually quite good. I think I liked Revenge of the Sith the most of all six and I am a star wars freak. Also, my 3.5 and 5.5 year old are addicted now as well. Only down side, is some of the deaths in the newer versions are a little too often and realistic unlike the original three. Caught me off guard a bit with the little guys watching."
1,Going to wait,"Way too many changes from the original cut. I don't mind sprucing up the color, sound and little extras in the background, but these ""special special special edition"" version are like actors who have had 47 plastic surgeries and you cant tell its them anymore. When they include the original cuts, THEN I will give Lucasfilm my money. VHS FTW!"
1,Terrible,"Seriously. The first three originals were great. Every new product seems to get further and further away from that. If you really like Star Wars, just enjoy the memories you have of what they used to be instead of the cruel torture of watching these ""fixed"" versions."
1,Surprise!,"Surprise! It sucks. I should have stopped caring about Star Wars after seeing Episode 1. Instead, I wasted my money on Episodes 2 and 3, all garbage. It's not like I have the money to spare for this trash nowadays anyhow."
1,I give up.,"Star Wars, I bid you adeiu.Until Lucas dies, and someone with a shred of integrity and perspective takes charge of the property, I'm not spending another cent."
1,He's ripping us off - again,Why couldn't he leave things alone? Are we going to get a SUPER-set in the future that has every version of every movie???? Can't I just have the same cuts the I saw in the theater (since '77)?
1,Not buying for simple reasons.,"To leave out the original theatrical releases is an insult to all of us who knew and loved the first movies! I do not want changes! George Lucas is a fool for conducting himself this way. Saddens me, it does."
1,I won't buy this again...,"I paid to see the originals in the theater, I paid for the VHS tapes, I paid to see the theatrical re-issues in 1997, I paid for the DVDs, and I've just had it. I don't need these anymore, no matter how much extra stuff Lucas had hidden away in vaults that he suddenly just ""discovered"" for this reissue.I'm not giving in again."
1,George Lucas ruined his own creation,"The saddest part of the saga of Star Wars is that future generations will never know what the original imagined story looked like. The Yoda we grew up with is now gone thanks to this edition; having been replaced with the fake computer graphic that infected the 3 prequels. It's bad enough that Darth was replaced with Hayden Christensen (a change that didn't even make sense considering neither Yoda or Ben appeared as their young selves)but this new remake replaces a lot of what made the original Star Wars so cool. Had Lucas allowed the original version to be an option alongside his remake, this wouldn't be an issue."
1,Product is great but receiving it?,I love the Star Wars series but i pre-ordered this in june and still havent received it and today is 9/21 and the movie came out 9/16. usually with preordered movies i get it the day it comes out or maybe the next day but not a Week.
1,Han shoots....um....LAST????!!!,"Yeah, this version is completely not worth the money. It DOES NOT contain the original theatrical releases. Considering Blu-/ray holds 100 gig. They.....couldn't fit them in....really...really guys???! Yeah, don't bother."
5,Best versions of Star Wars avaiable,"Best version of Star Wars on the market! Watched them all in a row in a super marathon! Loved the bonus features and new scenes are great! Ps in episode 4 A New Hope, during trash compacter scene when stormtropper hits his head there is a huge thud noise! Great movies, great fun, full HD! a must have for a true Star Wars fan!"
3,Original Trilogy should be available remastered on Blu Ray,"When the previous reviewer complains that we should all be content to view the original Star Wars Trilogy on the poor quality DVD's Lucas threw out a few years back he misses the mark. What the original reviewer may not realize is that Lucs just dumped the original trilogy on DVD without it being anamorphically ""enhanced"" as most modern DVD's are -which maximizes their video quality. He used the same transfers used for Laserdisc, simply to try to quell the many who were upset -and to stop the *bootlegs* on sale for years. The films at least should be allowed to be seen on BLU Ray in the original format as many have clamored for online in campaigns (thank you thedigitlabits.com ) for years. Lucas can still rake in many millions more by doing this."
1,Wow... Just wow... (Not in a good way...),"Where to begin;New DRM makes it not play on most equipment out there... I have a dozen different players from HTPCs to set top boxes... Only one played them properly, even after updating and waiting a few weeks for even more possible updates... Fox's fault...It was bad enough they changed the original three in the 'special edition'... But they just made them SOOO much worse... I actually cried while watching the original three... RELEASE an 'unedited' version of the originals you film hackers... Stop trying to 'fix' them. They were never broken until you got your grubby hands on them..."
3,Short review,"So, everything has been said so I just wanted to say that mr Lucas indeed knows how to keep bleeding money out of the franchise. Star Wars movies are a piece of art that just keep getting upgrades since its original release. Now, you had to put the infamous ""NOOOOOO"" that everyone complained and taged as being just ""the single most ridiculous scene in the Star Wars history"", dont you???."
5,Extremely pleased!!,I received the Star Wars Complete Saga brand new just what I ordered and it arrived in time for Christmas.
2,Sad but true,I haven't been disappointed in a Bluray release since the HD-DVD/BR battles. This is the set that broke that streak.If you have the DVD's keep them and don't bother. We never bought waiting for the BR's and so we'll keep these. Epic Fail Lucas.
1,You guys saved me.,"I was almost going to buy it, but then found out these are not the same movies I watched when I was a kid. Thanks one-star Amazon reviewers!"
1,Lucas is killing my childhood!,"All I can say is why? Why George Lucas, WHY?!? The original trilogy turned me into a star wars fanatic, I still remember watching them over and over again on vhs. They were in my opinion perfect, then the special edition versions were released in 1997 and my dad took me and my sister too see them it was cool seeing them in theaters since I wasn't born when they were originally released. What I didn't understand then is what I still don't understand to this day, why is Lucas messing with perfection? He furthers the destruction now with even more pointless and distracting changes with the blu-ray release. All I want is my original trilogy back, what I grew up with, what we all grew up with. We all fell in love with the originals for a reason, these changes make no sense! For how much I love Star Wars I will never buy this set. BOYCOTT STAR WARS BLU-RAY!"
1,Really George? Really,"All I can say is that with all of the changes George Lucas has made to these films over the years, these are no longer the movies I fell in love with as a kid. I don't understand why it is so hard to give the fans what they want. Just give us the theatrical cuts of the original trilogy and also offer the altered editions for those who are interested. I guess I could rant and rave as some others have, but the truth is I am just too heartbroken over this to put too much time and energy into it."
1,COMPLETE CRAP!!!!,"The latest alterations to the OT are to much to stomach. The greatest moment of redemption in film history Takes place in The Return Of The Jedi when Darth Vader throws the Emperor off the scaffolding to his death. Everything about this scene was perfect, but not to Geor- He who shall not be named. He who shall not be named has completely destroyed this scene buy dubbing Darth Vader saying ""no, NOOOOO!!"" which damages and ruins the movie. Somebody must stop He who shall not be named Before he decides to reanimate the corpse of Alec Guinness and start re-filming the movies from scratch."
5,Star Wars The complete Saga on blue-ray,"This is the first blue-ray boxed set i bought with my new entertainment system. It does not disappoint. You get it all; the colors of Coruscant at night pop out at you, everything is vivid and alive, the sound is spectacular. You can almost feel the lightsabers coming your way. The space battle scenes left my jaw hanging. Blue-ray does Star Wars justice! I highly recommend this boxed set!"
4,5 Stars if Lucas Doesn't Mess With the #@! Movies Again!,The transfer to blu-ray looks great and lucasfilm did a nice job at adding some special features. Unfortunately Lucas can not stop messing with the original trilogy so yet again he's messed around with the original films. All of this would be fine if there was another disc with the original films shown in theaters. Until then I will have to keep my laserdisc player around to watch the THX versions of the original theatrical release.
3,Great BluRay Set Just one Problem,Love the Blu-Ray treatment the StarWars Saga has just received. Just one problem. It is a repeat of Avatar. The discs have issues playing on a HTPC using both PowerDVD 11 and ArcSoft TrueMedia Theater 5. Both companies are stating a update is in the works. My rating is only on 20th Century Fox's Decision to hurt the customer by updating Anti-Copy. Sad thing is I was able to copy the discs and convert them to H.264 1080P files that Played flawlessly.
1,"Say ""Nooooooooo"" to Star Wars blu-ray....",...next year will be the 35th Anniversary. I can only hope that this so-called director will release the theatrical versions on blu-ray.
4,Fantastic! But...,"My Star Wars Blu-ray box set arrived this morning from Amazon (much to my surprise) and right away my son and I were ready to go! Wonderful packaging, albeit identical to the packaged style of the recent Aliens Anthology on BR.One minor miff though; box set arrived with TWO ROTJ disks sans disk 2 of the bonus features. This kinda ticks me a bit, but in a silly way, it makes mine a minor collectable. I hope GL and gang get this fixed soon.As for the haters out there piping on about GL destroying your childhood, get over it. Make a movie and do what you want with it. Personally, I enjoy all of the versions still because they ARE different. Why do I buy a remix album? Because it is different. Hey, I saw Ep IV in theaters on the opening night in '77 and every opening night since and you know what...my childhood is full of happy memories and one way or another and GL, Ben Burtt & the gang had something to do with that.Let's go HiDef!!!"
5,The highly anticipated Star Wars Saga on Blu-ray Disc!,"I can't wait for the release of the entire Saga on BD. It's going to be amazing! I've been a die-hard Star Wars fan since the release of the original trilogy in theatres, and have had the original trilogy on every consumer video format it's been released on (Beta, VHS, Laserdisc & DVD).Regarding the original trilogy, when they restored all three films for the 1997 re-release in theatres, after the prints where cleaned, they scanned all three films at 4k resolution and then did the digital clean-up and additions. The BD releases are starting with the 4k remastered digital negatives. I am fully confident that they will all look absolutely incredible and can't wait for the new lossless audio soundtracks, commentary and 40+ hours of extra material as well."
1,Original Theatrical Release Version Blu Ray? Alas no.,"What is the point of this uber version if a blu ray version of the original theatrical release is not included? Star Wars was the first movie I saw in the theater as a child and it set a precedent. Those are the versions I want, and I will not pay for this desecrated odium. Still waiting."
4,It's still Star Wars!,"No, this doesn't have the original theatrical releases you remember as a kid. Yes, Lucas has added some more ""tweaks"" and fixes. The fact remains, it's still STAR WARS! The picture looks the best it ever has, and the sound is outstanding. This is a great set, and it's a great price. It's packaged well, doesn't take up too much space. If you are a Star Wars fan, you owe it to yourself to see the movies in stunning hi-def. It's a beautiful feast for the eyes, and the ears. John Williams score hasn't sounded this clean since the original movies came out the first time, or if you were lucky enough to see Star Wars in concert and hear it live, this is as close as you can get. You will still enjoy it, and so will your kids. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
1,stop changing the movies you moron!,"If you enjoy the original trilogy, then don't bother buying this garbage, due to the ridiculous changes such as darth vader yelling NOOO!!! as he throws the emperor down to his death."
1,nooooooooo!!!!!!,"i havent seen the new releases yet but reading from reviews here and seeing for myself on you-tube that GHASTLY NOOOOOOOOOO scene and HORRENDOUS KRAYT DRAGON CALL, iv decided to save my 90 dollars and spend it another day. stick to the originals, they're still the best."
1,"If you enjoyed Star Wars as it originally was, show it and don't buy this!","You can vote with your dollars by NOT buying this, and then maybe... MAYBE... Lucas will give in to releasing the ORIGINAL cut of the first trilogy of movies. You want to go back and edit your movies George? Fine... you do that. But at least give your fans the OPTION to watch the movies that they grew up with as they were. It's NOT hard. At least it's not as hard as adding things that weren't there before."
1,Detracting Edits,"The original three Star Wars movies are easily some of the best movies ever made. George Lucas has changed that with his incessant, pointless editing. Instead of Han starting out as a cut-throat, which he was, Lucas tries to paint a prettier picture by having him shoot second. Then the ridiculous scene with the CGI Jabba, which stands out worse than anything, continues the downhill slide. The original trilogy is now full of edited scenes, CGI bits that look awful, and changes that make no sense. George Lucas should know that while people love Star Wars, they love the original Star Wars. There's a reason that he made the prequels, because the originals (which you can only buy on DVD in one release (2008) which is twice the price of the whole 6 Blu-Ray movies) were awesome.Just like Darth Vader now says ""NOOOO"" to the Emperor, everyone needs to say no to George Lucas and not buy this ""Star Wars"" release."
1,"Great resolution, terrible vision.",A painter doesn't go back to a masterpiece after thirty years and paint over it. A fisherman cannot recatch a trophy size fish and get twice the credit for it. Changing art after so long of a period of time is an attempt by George Lucas to appear to regain some of his brilliance--that is disgraceful.
1,JEDI ROCK ANYONE?,"Dear Mr. Lucas,Just give us a beautiful, booming HD version of the ORIGINALS. Improved sound and video? YES. Removed matte lines and beautiful backgrounds? YES. New scenes, actor-swaps and ROTJ MUSICAL NUMBERS. NO, PLEASE NO!I'm going to avoid buying this collection. But will G. Lucas ever give us what we want? One thing we can be sure of, we won't know that until long after we have had a chance to buy this set."
1,Double dip,This is a total double dip. Avoid at all costs. Vadar's NOOOOO is what I am saying to this collection: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
1,Re-watch the ones you have,"I did not and will not buy this. You shouldn't either. My mom picked it up but, I still have yet to watch it.I will not own this in my house until a version is put out with the option of watching it with and without added content.Give Lucas the finger like he has given his fans. Refuse to buy his table scraps."
1,"Leave it be, Lucas","I'll never know why Lucas thinks his perfect original trilogy needs so much improving. Obviously there are legions of fans that think otherwise. If he really wants to mess with his ""vision"" he should focus his time on fixing the prequels...they suck and are in dire need of improvements."
1,Horrible changes,"Sorry, but I've watched the new added scenes and voices, and it just completely destroys the movies. I don't know Lucas feels the need to go back and change things that never needed changing. Why he ignores his fans at all costs.."
1,NOOOOOOOO!,"The ""enhanced"" Vader said it best when asked if he would be buying Star Wars Blu Ray: NOOOOOOOOOOOO! I wonder if George Lucas will ever replace himself with CGI. He should do it. He's a muppet."
1,I'm done,"The movies I stood in line hours to see with my father are gone. This kind of greed shouldn't spoil my love for these films, but it does.There is a lot of great SiFi on disc now so do yourself a favor and try something new and different. Or instead, buy another altered version of these films. Trust me. You won't be missing out on anything because I'm sure another ""improved"" redo is in the works at this very moment."
1,"""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!""","The official death of star wars. George Lucas has continued to ignore fans, and put out copies of these films with the pure intent of making money. It's clear he is no longer the man he was when he made the glorious original trilogy, and that Star Wars has been destroyed by its own creator. George Lucas was once a pioneer in film making, and spoke out against altering films, but he has now become the very thing he swore to destroy."
1,"GEORGE: You got rich from THE 1977+ VERSIONS, JACKASS!","It's really simple, George. You first released Star Wars: A New Hope in 1977. That film made you a bajillion dollars then and in the years after. Ditto for the original releases of ESB and ROTJ. Maybe you hate them now. Maybe you wake up late at night, screaming incoherently, drenched in sweat, tortured over the hell you created in 1977+. Well, too bad. Suck it up. You became a billionaire thanks to fans who watched your films in 1977+, not '97, 2004, whatever. I'm going to be that guy and say it, you OWE US the originals. Period. End of discussion. Why? Because those are the films that made you rich, that we loved growing up. The films we paid for in 1977+. So, yes, George you friggin' douchebag, you OWE US those films. Anything else is a slap in the face and an insult to every fan who made you a billionaire."
5,Further changes...,"I just finished watching the prequels and noticed further changes not reported elsewhere... in Episode 1, as Padme walks past a sleeping Jar Jar on their way to Coruscant, I noticed that Jar Jar now moves his toe! What an innovation! In Episode 2, Dex's Diner now features a Keurig coffee machine. No joke! In Episode 3, the Smurfs now have their own box in the senate. Ridiculous!!! George Lucas can do whatever he wants to HIS movies, love the changes or hate the changes (he still didn't fix the Death Star schematic in episode 4, LOL) ... I still enjoy that galaxy far, far away... finally on crystal clear blu-ray."
1,Pfffftttttt...,"I'm gonna pretend to be really angry over all the changes.Nah, too much effort. The bizarre things done to the movies over the years just leaves extra money in my pocket. Please release the original theatrical versions of 4-6 on Bluray, Lucas. TIA"
1,Wish I still had a VHS machine,"Like so many others, I pre-ordered this edition back in January of 2011 with great anticipation. Given the large data capacity of the blu ray disc, it never occurred to me that Mr. Lucas would NOT include the original theatrical versions of Episodes IV-VI alongside the ""improved"" editions. While I respect Mr. Lucas's right to manipulate his property, I will not give him my hard earned money for this version of these beloved movies from my childhood. Call me a nerd, call me a geek, call me an old timer. All I want are the original versions we saw in the theaters. Mr. Lucas, maybe if enough of us return or cancel our orders, you will reconsider this ill-conceived release. I'd gladly pay more for the original versions alongside your updated ones in one giant set. Amazon... you'll be receiving my return shortly."
1,George ruining everything,"There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. The changes George made with the special editions was bad enough, but he's not completely neutered Darth Vader.The biggest travesty is that Lucas is making all these changes and the only movie in the original trilogy that he wrote or directed was A New Hope. I'm sure Jedi's director wouldn't agree with that Vader ""Nooooooooo""I was going to buy the Blu Rays, but not anymore"
5,Coming soon...3D!,"I understand a 3D version will be released in February. Imagine the possibilities: 3D original theatrical, 3D revised theatrical, 3D updated revised theatrical, 3D where Greedo and Han shoot at the same time. I can see the comments now: ""I want a set with Episode IV in 2D, and Episode III in 3D, but only with pre-THX 1.1 sound. And wouldn't it be great if Harrison Ford could be inserted into Episode II as some sort of time-warped Indiana Jones."" Sigh."
5,"All you fans, Come to your senses! From A true believer","From now on, we have the chance that this popular culture motion picture phenomenom to enyoy it with the best image and sound of High Definition posible. The original and special edition versions of the star wars saga it will be available to all of us. NO MORE OVER THE TOP CRITICISM. IT'S TIME TO HAVE FUN! PERIOD. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU."
1,Yo! that's family dog!,"I was part of a test audience for several screenings of the new versions for feedback on the new tweaks, its funny so many people hate the ""noooo"" line because the first line Lucas considered for Darth, was... ""That ain't right""and a later version had Darth say ""I didn't sign on for this"" before sending the emperor to his doom."
1,"This is the Death of Star Wars, and the End of a Legendary Legacy","Star Wars was a classic. Empire Strikes Back was a great sequel. Return of the Jedi was a letdown. The Prequels were an embarrassment to filmmaking. And then... Lucas started CHANGING THE ORIGINALS FOR NO REASON AT ALL. This was an abomination, and this is where I, and many others drew the line. Do not buy this. Do noy line Lucas' pockets. Take a stand and show the world that revisionism of classic movies should not be tolerated!"
1,Not buying this.,"I see now that I have to hold on to my THX laserdisc original versions a whole lot longer.I will absolutely, unequivocably, NOT buy this. It really irks me that George Lucas shows such flagrant disrespect not only to fans of the films, but to the films themselves. In the interest of brevity, let me put it simply: RELEASE THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS! William Peter Blatty and William Friedkin did it right with The Exorcist Blu-Ray: they treated the original 1973 version and the 2000 expanded edition as seperate entities, and gave each a lavish and respectful co-release in one, awesome package. That way, Mr Lucas, you present your updated version, while still honoring and respecting the hallowed place the original films hold in the hearts and imagination of a generation. Until then...NO SALE."
1,Stop Bankrolling Lucas the Hutt,"9 Blu-Ray discs and no original versions? I'm saddened but not surprised. The original movies that we all fell in love with no longer fit within George Lucas' ever-narrowing worldview, and thus are now deleted.Solving this is simple: don't buy them. We can all sit here and review until we're as blue as Papanoida, but as consumers our true voice is in our currency.You like the new super hi-def edition despite the missing originals? Great! Go buy it.If not? Stop feeding the Hutt."
1,"the movies keep stopping in the middle of the movie,,,,,,,another waste of money and it was a gift for my son. What is going on","The movie skips and then stops in the middle, again another gift and a waste of money. very upset with this purchase."
1,Blu-Ray? More like Boo-Nay!,"I've never purchased the original trilogy on DVD, as I wanted to spend my money only once on a pristine edition of the three films I remember from my childhood. I'm saddened by George Lucas opting to not include the versions we purists prefer. And really, it's not so much a case of hating on his digitally 'updated' renditions; it has more to do with omitting pieces of theatrical history. It's as though Lucas has gone to work in George Orwell's world of 1984, rewriting history so many times that nobody can remember what the truth was anymore. Boo. Nay."
4,Great Picture and Sound,"I was too young when the originals were made, I just love a good story with great special effects. These Blu-rays are beautiful, all 6 of them look amazing, and sound amazing. The look and sound of these movies are so great that I fell in love with these movies all over again. It was like watching them for the first time. You know when something is right in front of you, but until the right times you never really see it. That was my experience with these movies. I didn't think I could like them anymore than I already do, but these Blu-rays have proven me splendidly wrong."
3,No jewel cases....fail,"I'm reviewing the packaging for this product. This is supposed to be the shining crown of someone's collection and you get the discs in a booklet, slid into sleeves on each page. The LOTR Blu-ray set is packaged 100 times better than this junk. Epic Fail."
1,Idiotic Computer Animated Version,"Don't buy this unless you like computer animated cartoons inserted randomly throughout the movie you grew up with. Also, don't expect the same music on Jabba's barge in Return of the Jedi -- it has been replaced by computer cartoons dancing to music written for divas. Just say ""No Originals, No Sale""."
1,Star Wars Trilogy has been heavily edited,"This release contains versions of the Star Wars trilogy that have been heavily edited. The colors have been digitally changed, the audio is not the same, and there are parts added and parts missing (2 songs from ""Return of the Jedi"" are missing and ""Star Wars"" is censored so that when imperial officers get hit, there used to be flaming holes in their bodies- this is gone now). Also, there are obvious changes like Greedo shooting first, Darth Vader screaming ""Nooooo"" like he did in Revenge of the Sith, the actor who played old Anakin is gone in the ghost scene- also there is Jar-Jar at the end of Return of the Jedi.Please give us the real movies!"
1,Obviously everyone at Lucasfilm just kisses George's behind?,"My son is turning 4 and I've been excited to get the blu-ray set for his first Star Wars experience. After reading about now even MORE tinkering with the originals I'm very tempted to wait.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what people want. Keep the original films the same OR AT LEAST include them as the original presentation with the package. Any changes done should get positive approval from the SW community.You would THINK of all the people working at Lucasfilm that they would have at least 10 hard core fans view all of these changes and give their honest opinions about them. I'm starting to think George Lucas comes up with an idea and no matter how bad it is (like these ridiculous sounding new audio clips) the cronies at the ranch just say ""Yes, master"" and do the work without any honest input!A ""no-brainer"" purchase just got turned into a ""we'll see"". :-("
1,Lack of Original Versions,"These films are Lucas' babies. But these films are a part of our childhood and each provide great memories for each of us. If Lucas wants to make changes, thats fine. But give us the option to watch the originals."
1,Disappointed this will not have original theatrical versions,"I had originally ordered this set in April, 2011 only to cancel the order after thinking about it. I love Star Wars, but they are highly marketed. They will release this version and multiple others. They sucker you into buying new version after new version to get the options that you would have liked with the first release. This blu-ray boxed set should include both the new and original versions of the movies. We all know that will be released at a later date, also (probably after many releases of ""special editions""). I choose to wait until they release the version I want and know will eventually come."
2,Too advanced,"My two year old VISIO player does not recognize these discs. Blue Ray by the way. The company sent me their latest upgrade and it still would not work. Nice idea advancing electronics, but make sure that they willplay on your machine. I hope to see them someday."
1,Cheap Paper Storage Case is Going to SCRATCH Your Blu-ray Discs,"Do any of you realize that sliding your discs in and out of this cheap paper storage is going to scratch all your discs?I can't believe people are ignoring the fact that the storage case securing all the discs is CHEAPLY made and going to damage your discs. Hmmm....maybe that's their strategy.Wow, people are getting hosed on this deal. ""F"" on your cheap storage case George. GREED! People deserve a better storage case than this -- one that's not going to scractch my discs!!!"
2,Collector's Beware: Shoddy Packaging in the U.S.,"This review is in specific reference to the packaging Fox is using for the U.S. Blu-Ray release of the Star Wars Saga. Like the Alien Anthology, Fox has opted to use a sleeve-book case. Not a multi-disc BD case, not slim BD cases, not even a digipak. Just the lackluster protection of cardboard sleeves to guard the Blu-Ray discs.However, from the pictures I've seen, the UK release uses a more commonsense case design (either a multi-disc BD case or slim BD cases in a box).Using a case like this for a catalog title of this magnitude is utterly disgusting. I've already cancelled my Amazon pre-order and intend to import the UK edition...assuming they don't adopt a similar, eco-friendly, junk-design cover."
1,Eh,"I agree with everyone else. If George would have included the original theatrical releases I would have recommended it. As for now, I can't."
1,"""Improvements""","I grew up loving these movies but am a far cry from a ""fanboy"" or ""purist"". However, you don't need to be Star Wars-obsessed to see that most of the changes that GL has made have created awkward, disjointed and distracting scenes that disrupt the viewing experience. I would have no problem with changes if they were improvements but many are detrimental and disappointing."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could.,"This is not the Star Wars movies I will be showing to my son in a few years. I was hoping for an unchanged version of the films- the films I cherished when I was a child, (the originals, don't really care about the prequels because they were crap) just with better definition and sound.This is like taking a naturally beautiful woman and dressing her up like a whore.No thanks."
1,Just say NOOOO! Boycott this garbage!,"This is really quite sad to see Lucas continues to only listen to his own ego and think fixing things that aren't broken to be just so very important. Anyone who buys this is only reinforcing his delluded notions that what he is doing is right andc good for the franchise. From what I've seen, from what many fans have felt and stated quite vocally, this is not the case. Lucas isn't listening to our words however. There is only one thing that will get his attention, and that is money. Vote with your dollars - BOYCOTT IT!"
1,I wanted to buy this,"I really wanted to purchase this set, and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Unfortunately both directors saw fit to mess with their movies post-release and neither is getting my money.The DVD versions of the original trilogy are going for over $100 here on Amazon. The Blu Ray versions of the modified movies are going for $80, and that is all six movies! Seems the people have spoken quite clearly, produce a Blu Ray version of the originals!!!!"
4,Please! Stop crying!,"Star Wars fans, please stop crying! First, no one has seen the new complete Blue Ray version. It comes out in September 2011. Lets wait until then to make our judgments. It may look great! As far as Lucas adding to the originals (IV, V, and VI), remember, as much as we loved them, in their theatrical release, Lucas said that ""he never really finish the first 3 films and he did so. You may noy like it but remember one important fact. While many Star Wars fans feel the movies are theirs, it's not. There are George Lucas' and if he felt they weren't finish and he had to add to them, like it or not it's his and only his decision. Finally, all fans, enjoy any Star Wars versions you love best whether on VHS, disc, DVD, HD, or Blue Ray. They are all true cassics."
2,I swear their lips are digitaly altered,"Watched Episode IV and I'm pretty sure that the lips or the actors were digitally altered. It looks like the actors are over pronouncing.Everything is nice and detailed. Its just the faces look, too dynamic."
2,No thanks George.,No way I could sit through episodes I and II again. Or the first half of III. Just plain bad.
1,What's the point?,Why pay for the blu-ray set when it doesn't even include the original theatrical releases? It's amazing that George Lucas and Fox studios won't include the original releases of the movies that are worth money.
1,Pre order is a waste of time,"I preordered 8 months ago. As of today this set can be purchased at any and every retailer and yet I still do not have my copy. What BS! To add further insult I paid $10 more to have the privilege of waiting 10 extra days to receive my copy.Sorry amazon. At is my last preorder with you. Go to best buy, cheaper and you walk out with it.Mark"
2,disappointed =(,"Bummed out its missing the ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" while campy and low production quality it still was a fantastic show at its time."
5,Star War The Complete Saga (Blu-ray),Great product and had great service getting it. With it in stock it only took a couple of day to receive and had in time for a christmas present
1,just terrible,It's like George Lucas is giving all his fans the finger; while adding millions more to his already overstuffed pockets.
1,unforgivable disgrace,"george lucas is taking a poo on our favorite childhood movies: the original star wars trilogy. he has no disregard for untouched classics and he is being outright insulting to his fans by releasing this steaming pile of awful computer graphics that infests a once ingenious masterpiece. the costumes, the scenery, the puppets, the sound effects; they're all made from real things and pieces of artwork that should not have ever been degraded by unnecessary computer graphics. release a dvd version of the originals! something thats actually worthy of our money."
1,"No original theatrical editions, no sale","Sorry, Lucas, not this time. Never again. You had a chance to redeem yourself in the eyes of fans by including the original versions, remastered and in HD on this set, and once again you shun the people that made you rich in the first place. Well, not this time. Until the original versions are released, in remastered HD quality, you're not getting another penny of my money."
1,This release has gone too far,"Be Warned, this is release is full of more than simple revisions of the like of Greedo's shot. Adding the abominable ""NOOOO!"" to the most climactic moment in the saga is beyond poor taste, its sickening. Obi won's new howl as well, is really shockingly poor.If these revisions weren't disturbing enough, the colors are still atrocious, Vader's lightsaber is still pink in certain shots, the black levels are still crushed, and most of the other errors from the 2004 masters are still here. Even the audio mix has errors from the 2004 dvd.I highly recommend avoiding this."
3,the crux of the matter of SE vs originals (I believe),"I much prefer the extended special editions of the original trilogy --- the only part I don't like is the infamous who-shot-first change, since it altered thecharacter of Han. (The fact that the effect wasn't particularly well done reallydidn't help either.)Lucas' argument that the effect changes in the SE matches his original plan seemsperfectly reasonable -- the technology just wasn't available at the time. That's Fine. But that bar room scene was something he could have changed at the time, so the 'technology' gap doesn't apply.I wonder how many nay-sayers wouldn't demand the originals, if it wasn't for that one change..."
1,"another ""enchanced"" version","I will probably buy this crap because of the love I have for the original. However this is crap. All of the bonus nonsense is pure crap. Voice overs, added CGI, songs... George Lucas must be stopped!"
1,IN-complete is more like it!,"The Complete Collector's Edition of Blade Runner was done the right way. It includes all 4 official versions of the film plus Ridley Scott's 2007 Final Cut, giving fans the choice to watch any version they want.When it comes to Star Wars, we can only get the latest re-imagining from George Lucas. The original movie is what made all the other movies/toys/etc. possible. Even when looking at it as film history, why is he so against releasing the originals?I would be the first one in line to buy the Complete Star Wars Saga on Blu-ray if they included the Original Theatrical Versions in HD. As it stands, I'll just have to hold on to my Star Wars Trilogy laserdisc set that is still The Definitive Collection."
1,"Someday, someone is going to have to say: ""ENOUGH""","Really? MORE changes? I'm done with this nonsense, I am HAPPY with the REGULAR special edition. THIS IS RIDICULOUS, BOYCOTT BOYCOTT BOYCOTT!!!!"
5,I was wrong !!,"I was one of the 1000 - one star reviews based on missleading information. I wanted to have these movies in bluray despite my frustration. I am glad I purchased this package. It is wonderfull. Movie quality and sound could not be better. The package presentation is awesome. Get it, you will not regret it"
1,No,This is a product that would make even Jar Jar Binks disappointed.Buying it sends the wrong message. Ship it back to Lucas.
4,If only George had let Darth remain silent...,"Not too bad...a decent consolidation and retelling of a classic tale of downfall and redemption, Jedi style. Other than, of course...<SPOILER ALERT>In that final moment of conflict for Darth Vader, having to choose between his teacher and his son, his silent suffering and the internal battle he wages while making that choice was far more gut-wrenching and harrowing when he was silent. Hearing him now cry out and make his choice so early in that critical moment robs an enormous amount of energy from that scene, and really was a poor choice of re-editing. I turn the sound down at that point now.Still worth the purchase price, though, and a 4-star rating."
1,"To quote Caesar...""NO!""","OK, George. I put up with your CGI Jabba, Greedo shooting first and the ghost of Hayden Christensen even though I didn't like them. I honestly didn't mind the cosmetic changes like adding bits and pieces to certain scenes and cleaned up special effects like light sabers and whatnot. But adding DIALOGUE?! Puuuuuhhhhleeeaaaasse. I was going to for sure buy this set but decided against it after today's fiasco."
1,Vote with your wallet!!!,I grew up watching the original versions and cringe at all the silly changes that have been made in the past 15 years. Now they are adding MORE?? I may rent or borrow to see how they look in 1080p but won't be buying until they remaster the originals.Join me people. Let's see how fast we can send this release to the bargain bin.I do think it was a good idea to put CGI Yoda in TPM but who watches the prequels anyway?
1,boycott this release,I for one am boycotting this release. I encourage others to do the same. Sorry Amazon but this is pure garbage and George Lucas is an idiot.
1,sucker....NOT!,"George...tired of making excuses for your obvious disregard for the fans that have created your fortune. You've lost all credibility, sad."
1,bastardized product,"if you liked the originals, you should probably consider not purchasing these revised versions. if this set included the unaltered originals, it would be worth the money, as is, it's not worth anything"
4,Great Blu Ray quality,Wish he had re edited it so much. I had memorized the original. Even the primitive special effects in episode 4 were changed. Sometime the original is best. Video quality was exceptional and it was technically great. Even the sound was stunning with the walkers in episode 5 and 6. Technically a great blu ray but the re-editing leave a lot to desire. Extra were better then expected. Wish George Lucas would have left it alone. My kids never saw the original episode 4 since Lucas messed with the early 90s release.
3,"Good item, missing pieces","I received this item near Christmas, and, while I am impressed at the quality, I am disappointed to find that I have two Episode V discs and am missing Episode VI. I noticed this far too late so I cannot return it."
3,"A lot of good stuff, but...","I have a number of the Dummies books, and they are all pretty useful, as is this one. But I would recommend ""Just the tips, man for Microsoft Word 2000"" if you really want something that gets to the point. That book has just the stuff you need to learn and get better on the software. It's not like your typical manual."
5,good for quick review of a topic,"I originally used Nita Rutkosky's book on Office 2000. It's also written lucidly, and it has projects or problems scattered throughout the chapters, as well as at the ends. of the chapters.I found Word 2000 for Dummies very useful when I wanted to quickly tackle a task I rarely do. The index is helpful, and the text is clear and easy to follow. For example, its discussion of mail merge is one of the clearest and most logical I've seen. It enabled me to do a mail merge when I suddenly had to do this one day. Following the instructions in Word 2000 for Dummies, I did this successfully on the first attempt."
3,untitled,"Once you get past the first chapter, and the author's very opinionated defenitions of what a witch is, this book is actually enjoyable. Wicca is a belief based on the idea of being able to believe whatever you want and know there is no right or wrong. Lora O'Brien seems to disagree with that and makes it very clear, in an almost bitter way. Where you live does not make you anymore of a witch than someone else who claims the same title. Being Irish is not simply defined by where you live or how you live. This book should really be titled, Irish folk stories from a Cranky Irish Woman."
3,It's ok...,"It's heavily influenced by Wicca (but in this day and age, what hasn't been?), and in the opening paragraph she states her studies have been of such. Her blunt style of writing is refreshing, and she doesn't advocate the ""make it up as you go"" witchcraft, because it'd be an insult to the given culture (and she's right too)."
4,A good read,"A little more wiccan than witchcraft, but still a good read. I liked that the author's writing style is very personal; she writes as if she is talking to you which is nice. She also includes a lot of nice little folk traditions like the story about the woman walking counter-clockwise around her heighbors house to hex it, or her own experiences with the Morrigan. I think that this book probably does present a good picture of actual practice of some people in Ireland today and so its worth the read to get a feel for modern witchcraft."
2,Nothing new here,"I really didn't find anything new in this book that I hadn't already read somewhere else and in those books, I didn't have to deal with O'Brien's Irish elite philosophy. Sharynne NicMhacha""s Queen of the Night has much more to offer. O'Brien has a real problem with anyone claiming Celtic origins due to the blood in their veins. To me this denies cellular memory and the natural inclination to work with tribal and ancestor deities that one may be drawn to. I'm proud that she can call herself a ""Irish Witch"", but equally proud to call myself a ""natural witch"" with an Irish, Scottish, Welsh and Texan ancestry. I would love to visit the country and I would love to learn the language and I'm sure it would enrich any spiritual path, but it isn't a prerequisite to being an authentic witch."
3,Good Cool weather costumed,"Definitely fairs to the large size, easy to dress warm under which you will need/want to doif you live in a cold climate area."
3,Travelling Cooler,This product is great for road trips and it keeps items cool all day long. It's easy to clean and packs well.
4,Sephora Mascara,"It's a really good mascara but, the shipping cost was way too high. I wouldn't buy it again through amazon...."
1,Disappointed.,"These baskets are bright orange...not close to anything ""natural"" except a pumpkin. The interior of both of the small baskets have broken pieces sticking up...not suitable for the delicate items I intended to store in there. Plus I tried to put in something with a little bit of weight, and it sounded like they were going to fall apart. Back to amazon they go..."
2,yellow,"The baskets are yellow! Not the brown color as they are depicted on the sceren, to small. I returned them...."
3,Great if you are already a fan,If you already like Ian Dury and the Blockheads then this album is a must as there are some tracks on here that don't seem to be available anywhere else. On the other hand it is some years since Ian's death and the best stuff has already been released some time ago. There are also some tracks on this album that are on a number of others.By all means complete your collection with this set of songs but if you are new to the wonderful Mr Dury it's not the best choice.
1,"iimportant work item was not recevied, they sent the wrong item.","Not happy at this moment we ordered a blade for an important job and when the package finally came it was the wrong item. it is costing us extra in time and money. we are very unhappy so we are waiting for this company ""treeline"" to make good on their service. We live in a remote area and this blade was for a high priority job. We will see if and when they send us the proper item. or reimburse our money!"
4,We love it,"One of the best things, it is fun when they are sitting and when they get older it is a great pillow for them to lay on to watch TV, nice and large.. My problem is my dogs also love it!!"
1,NOT SAFE -- DO NOT BUY!,"Do not buy this product -- it is NOT safe. The ""spoke"" of one of the arms has poked through the flimsy fabric...and this even though we hardly ever use it (our 5 1/2 month old cannot reach the toys, placed at least 10 inches above babies tiny hands, and it's overstuffed edges roll him into the center, and ON TO HIS FACE!) We have a flat mat (Gymini, I think,) that our son just loves, and has loved since he was 2 weeks old. I am throwing Lotty Ladybug out, I don't want to risk another child's parent picking it up at a resale shop."
1,Stale - Past Due Date,"I ordered these on January 14, 2006. They shipped the next day. I tried them and found them dry and hard. I thought I just didn't like them. I didn't eat them frequently. Recently, I looked at the box and realized why they seemed so dry and hard: the box says ""Best When Used By 07 Oct 2005"". That's right: 2005- Over three months before I placed my order. I had purchased three different flavors on January 14, 2006, one box of each. I liked one of them, but the other two tasted dry. Now I know why. The one I liked, was not past it's due date. The other two were. This included a box of Balance Gold Crunch Cookies N' Creme that says ""Best When Used By 10 Jul 2005"", over six months before I placed my order. Amazon: I want my money back."
3,Rude Review,Solid live album. Production is not bad with the exception of Al Pitrelli's channel. It is nowhere as clear and as loud as Mustaine's guitar. Even Ellefson's bass is sonically bold and upfront on the recording which is what I love. I wish they had mixed in the lead guitarist's instrument a little louder. Good selection of ten punchy tracks with an accompanying DVD of the actual show. Very solid package.
1,"I Agree, the stickers don't stick","The idea is great, the stickers are horrible. You have to tape them to get them to stick"
4,The Ultimate Disco Song That Does nt Go Away...,"""Maybe This Time"" was the song that said it all. It meant so much to so many people. Always a class song, now the disco crowds (at least back in the 1980 s) were finding a new meaning to something that would evidently become a kind of anthem, of what might happen, could happen and with any luck ,should happen. Norma Lewis takes this great song and makes it greater. The backing, the beat, the whole thing comes together to make what I consider a disco classic. The saying ""they dont make um like they use to"" could well be true about this version of the song and I have yet to hear a better floor filler than this. The rest of the songs on this CD are all good especally ""Tonight (Dancing With The Desperate"" and ""For All We Know"""
4,"Very easy to use and fast DVD creator, but the output could be better...","Last week I downloaded a complete concert from the internet, and decided to make a DVD with it. I used this software to make it, and it was really easy and fast. I added menus with background music and video and still images, and the whole project, from the beginning of the ""production"" until the end of the recording into the disc took about two hours, considerably less than other softwares like Ulead...But the output wasn't the best. The audio kind of distorsioned a little, and in five or six parts it just didn't play anymore and it took about one minute to get back in the playback.However, this is veyr easy, and the other applications, like CD's softwares, camcorder to mpg and other stuff work perfectly."
1,I did not purchase this product.,I did not purchase this product.I did not purchase this product.I did not purchase this product.I did not purchase this product.I did not purchase this product.
1,Not what it said.,"This says: Original MOtion Picture Soundtrack.It wasn't.It was someone making a mushy piano translation of the original soundtrack.The original had works by many writers, and done on different instruments.I would like to get my money back.J. Levy"
4,OZZY!,"Think the original Oz books are plenty strange...but looking for something even stranger? This may just fit the bill. Oz is real, and Skipp and Levinthal crank up the weird for this decidedly modern take on Baum's classic world, filled with many of the original characters (who may or may not be as you remember them), plus conspiracy, sex, war, goomer meat, and a haunted computer. Judy Garland is rolling in her grave. Check this one out."
5,Apocalypse Oz,"What do you get when you mix the magical land of Oz, CIA hijinks, a possessed laptop, occasional dismemberment, fabulous Mexican food, and a hottie named Aurora Quixote Jones? THE EMERALD BURRITO OF OZ, of course! This ain't your daddy's Oz, no question. Instead, it's more like APOCALYPSE NOW meets THE WIZARD OF OZ as directed by Terry Gilliam. Authors John Skipp (of Skipp & Spector splatterpunk fame) and Marc Levinthal (who co-wrote the score for the film VALLEY GIRL) reinvent Oz for the new Millennium, managing to make the fabled land over the rainbow wonderful and surreal and comic and terrifying. GET THIS BOOK!!!!"
2,Buyer beware....,"I don't know if this RAM is any good because it doesn't actually fit in our PowerMac G5. I was a little wary because we've had trouble with upgrades fitting in the slots before, but this description does not indicate that it will not work in our version of the G5. We have one of the early releases (PowerMac 7.2, 2GHz dual core) which is what I'm assuming causes the problem."
3,Too high,"CVS pharmacy has the 14 patch Step 1 system cheaper than this 7 patch, and no it's NOT a sale item!"
4,Good for sensitive skin.,"The Quattro blades, in my opinion, are far superior to the Mach 3 in all respects, except one. The blades remain sharper for probably and extra week over the Mach. They get a closer and less irritating shave. The problem is that they can be more expensive. If you have sensitive skin, it might be worth the extra money to use the Quattro"
5,great job as a razor,I have been using Gillete for long time and then one day I tried this Schick Quattro. I found it really good and effective. Its very smooth and comfortable esp for someone like me who somehow enjoy a good dense beard :(. I wish Schick will defintiely reduce its price though.
4,Schick has great products,The replacement cartridges are essential for the quattro. I really like the product but wish there was a way to clean the blades better. You can always get a better shave if you have clean blades.
5,lot cheaper than the stores!,"cant beat the price,will be buying more in the future,for me and the wife! glad i found it on the internet!"
2,Not so good,"This 4-blade doesn't provide such a god shave, especially if my beard is long. I've only used one of the three Blades so maybe the next one will be better."
4,Uniden Radios,"These are nice little units. My only complaint is that the range is not quite what it says. I doubt you could get these to go 10 miles. They could have positioned the volume button in a different place too, as it is hard to hit the transmit button without accidentally hitting the volume button at the same time. Other than this, these are good units for the price."
2,Less range than old FRS radio!,"These are nice looking, but aren't very good at range. The stated 10 mile range must be in outer space as it's certainly not on earth. Range is less than 1 mile with the full boost on. My old Audiovox FRS radios went at least a half mile farther than these!They seem to receive well and the weather alert functions well and seems fairly sensitive.If you don't need a long range they are ok. Quite a disappointment for power/range though.Were I to be able to do it over I think I'd look to another brand. This is currently their top-end model."
1,not pleased..........,"Despite many tries, I could never get these 2 ways to work. Even one mile from my home they were not functioning. I tried different channels, volumes etc. My friend has the same one that work fine.. maybe these were just defective."
1,Yikes!!!,"Perhaps Nicholas Gunn is not a Native American? I know Douglass Spotted Eagle is. Either way their music is much better than Mr. Mirabals. Being a fan of Southwestern New Age I bought this CD going by the previous reviews. I was very dissapointed. What is this anyway? Why? Whatever. The performance is uninspiring, the lyrics are silly at times, the singing is...unusual and the musicians are bored. Is this guy really a Native American? The passion does not come out in this performance. My opinion only! Don't get excited."
2,I was pretty disappointed,"After reading all these rave reviews I was expecting something pretty amazing. I don't think the guy has that great a voice, arrangements are so-so, instrumentation is mediocre. Maybe he's an acquired taste.Would suggest you download a couple of tracks and listen before you buy."
5,BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL!,"Music from a Painted Cave is one of the most beautiful productions that I've had the good fortune to see. I saw the performance live, and I wasn't sure that I breathed for the entire length of the show. I didn't believe that it could get any better, but oh how wrong I was. Leave it to Robert Mirabal to best his own performances! Music from a Painted Cave masterfully demonstrates ancient cultures and brings it all into the present as the show goes on. The music and the dancers are stunning, the writing is second to none, and the whole Mirabal family is brilliant in the performance. The dance with Father and Daughter actually brought tears to my eyes. There just aren't enough words to describe the beauty of this music and this performance!!"
5,A musical masterpiece,"I have had this album for about 4 years and I still play it all the time. It never grows old. It is absolutely one of the top few albums I've ever heard. There's not a bad song on it. Robert Mirabal has outdone himself with these versions of all his songs. If you ever get the chance, see him live. You won't believe how great it is to see him perform this show in person."
5,If You Love Native Music!,If you love Native Music then you just have to own this..... I just recieve my copy and I just can't get enough of it. I can't wait to buy more of this wonderful artist's music.
4,A long time fan.,"Robert is a true entertainer with many wonderful and great talents, which is well proven in ""Music from a Painted Cave"". It is obvious he has worked hard to get where he's at and is surely proud, as he should be. Unfortunately he is sometimes criticized by those who can't see outside the ""box"". However, if you visit his web page, take a moment to read his bio, find out what makes him who he is and more importantly read the messages from his fans, including over 900 new entries from people who watched this PBS special, hearing him for the very first time and instantly fell in love with his style. Robert is truly a unique performer, his individuality and powerful messages make this CD and video outstanding. What a wonderful mixture of traditional music and dance blended with modern new age and rock; it's beautiful, touching, fun, and most of all SINCERE."
5,Classics faithfully recorded by favorite voices,"I listen to this album in my car all the time. I bought it for track #4, ""How's the World Treating You"" with James Taylor and Allison Krauss. But listening to these wonderful old songs reminds me how clever, harmonious and REAL country music used to be. There are plenty of famous people singing the Louvin Brothers' songs - Emmylou Harris, Vince Gill, Merl Haggard, Linda Ronstadt, Del McCoury, Dolly Parton - but the quality of the songs transcends the years gone by or the singers performing them. There are just no songs better than ""New Partner's Waltz"" or ""Are you teasing me?""...and the harmony will have you singing along too."
5,Great Music,This CD is a wonderful collection of the Louvin Bros music. The artists have performed these songs with great feeling and I hear a certain pride in their renditions. I'd buy this one any day!!
5,Bluegrass meets the blues,"Hows the world Treating You, James Taylor and Allison Krauss are awesome, the song is the epotime of a broken heart, and a tear in your beer"
5,Frickin' AWESOME!!!,"I was at first extremely skeptical about this whole Playboy cd, 'cause well... it's PLAYBOY, I mean, c'mon. I was kind of expecting some tasteless ..., but my assumptions were WAY off. I am an extremely avid jazz fan, and I was so impressed with what this cd had to offer! Definitely sets you in the mood! Go get it and try it yourself!"
4,Something For Enjoyment,"This is a great complimation, but that is exactly what it is. If you are a real jazz katt, go out and find these original recordings on there record release. Never ever say jazz junkie again, that's irregular. Best Listening!"
5,one of the BEST extensions beyond OSHO,"amoda is certainly on her game. what a flowing, balanced book.cannot recommend it high enough. she modifies osho and other experts in her own lived-thru, expert way.it would have been even more perfect had there been a CD with this!it deserves to stay in print! at this low price (see the amazon sellers!), you can get one for yourself and others. a great gift.no fluff here. straightforward wisdom from all chakras.i love how amoda is speaking from her own deep experience, from or AS her own embedded, embodied chakras..................namaste! jai jai amoda!"
5,Gentle misuc,"My second purchase of this CD as a present. Prompt service again from this vendor. Gentle listening, great while driving. Very relaxing."
4,More info than I thought,"If you want to learn about digital cameras, and how to use it with a PC, this one is for you. Kinda slow at first, but then he jumps right in and you learn alot. It is worth the money"
4,excellent video on all aspects of photography,"sometimes instead of reading a bunch of books i like to watch videos on how things are done...this was a very good video on all aspects of photography, including lenses and composition and the rule of thirds...very good video...worth the price.."
5,Buy this!,"One after another these songs by original artists are outstanding and deliver a positive message as well. Our 2 year old's favorite cd, and we love it too!"
2,It's the wrong filter,"OK, part of this is my own stupidity. I looked at the picture that goes with this product, and it clearly says HF-9. However, the product description says HF-1. Anyway, I looked at the picture and thought I was getting that, and now I have the wrong filter. Oh, and it's a knock-off filter, not a real Eureka. Again, this is not what you see in the picture. It was shipped quickly, arrived on time, but now I have to go through the hassle of returning it."
1,Most important content missing,"This entire book is based on figuring out what ""color(s)"" you are and the portion of the book with the colors and attributes is missing. It would have been extremely pertinent to mention this because really the book is not worth anything without those cards. It's like a dictionary with no entries, only definitions."
2,Too technical for me!,"I was looking for a book to try to help me with my future mother in law who is a narcissist. However, this book was a little too technical for what I was looking for. I can't give it a bad review, because I really got through very little of it - it just didn't hold my interest at all. If you're looking for something that in depth than it might be for you - but if you're just looking for an easy read and a little help dealing with someone very difficult I'd look elsewhere!"
2,Not worth what I paid for it,"I thought this would be a perfect container for my son's diaper bag. Boy was I wrong! Yes, it has a sliding close lid but it doesn't stay shut. It doesn't click into place or have a latch or anything. So, if the bag was bustled the lid would slide open and dump everything out."
3,"Very cute, but . . . .","It isn't incredibly sturdy. There is no way to ensure that the sliding lid on top stays closed,though it works fine for things like grapes and carrot sticks. Even though I hand wash and we don't use it every day, the decoration has not help up nearly as well as the other Pecoware items we have."
5,super nice,"very nice Cup for breakfast at school, excellent product, exactly as seen in the photo to the baby charm you, thanks for selling as beautiful products.muy lindo la taza para los desayunos en el colegio, excelente producto, exactamente igual como se ve en la foto al bebe le encanto, gracias por vender productos tan bellos"
4,"Kinda small, but durable","I was kind of surprised at how small it was, but it works just fine for my intentions.. My 3.5 & 2 yr olds didn't like the top so we never really used it. I think the opening is too small for their hands"
1,Sound Quality [was not good!],"I love Oh Romeo, and love everything that Bobby Orlando does and produce. But Hot Productions, did a terrible job on transfering the master tapes on to CD. It's sound more like a used vinyl to CD, Collector, ""O"" Records collector and Hi-NRG collector BEWARE of awful sound."
3,slightly better than average album.....,"this album contains one of the best songs i've heard in a while and that is ""I'll Show You"". though with this song in the album, i wasn't quite pleased with the whole cd..mostly are average songs and others sound just like the other. it's not bad though, it's an average album and this band have what it takes to be successful... but they are yet to prove that on their sophomore album. other songs worth mentioning are Inside Out, Strange and Fame. if you are looking for quality alternative albums..try these: July For Kings, Greenwheel & Pay The Girl."
4,hidden treasure,"It's shame this never got big although this sounds big. There's hint of lifehouse n other bands that came later out. Sounds of Matchbox 20, but lacks it's variety.i hope the guy who makes the music continues, cos this is really hidden gem.."
2,From the Heart... To the Dumpster.,"Okay, so Eva O. had this enormous epiphany and found Jesus. Big deal. The lyrics on this CD are tragic, akin to perusing the Religious section at a Hallmark store. The far too few songs in which Rozz is the helmsman (""Hall of Mirrors"" and ""Forever Came Today"" are glorious) are the only things that save this klunker from going straight to the used CD store. I felt as if I were being forced to sit through a Young Life meeting while listening to this syrupy garbage.Eva - Satan was better for you, believe me. This CD is crap."
3,pucker up,"Merchant shipped promptly. Satisfied with merchant. Syrup itself was very, very, VERY sour. Like it makes you pucker up the inside of your mouth it's so sour! Tried it a couple of times then it went in the trash. Very disappointed."
3,Windshield mount does not work . Don't know about the GPS,"The windshield mount does not stick to the windshield.This is poor construction and design by Magellan.Having a lot of trouble with a brand new piece that I purchased.Looking at the dashboard mount now. But that dosen't seem to have much favourable reviews either.I may just return the GPS.Too much trouble to get started.Cannot really comment about the accuracy of the roadmaps since I cannot attach the GPS. But tried entering a new road that was constructed about a year ago and the maps on the GPS could not find it, so they are at least a year old.Giving it 3 stars because my friend has an older version that attaches with a clip and it does a decent job. So maybe it works well when you can attach it securely."
5,Magellan RoadMate 700 GPS Auto Navigation System Review,"I bought one about 4 months ago. I first made the stupid mistakes like ""this think doesn't work because I am in California instead of Virginia"", but you need to make some initial setting adjustments to ensure that the thing works as intended, e.g. sound intensity and current location. I called the manufacturer and they answered right away and gave me the info that I needed.Sometimes you need to wait a few minutes to let the unit receive the satellite signal but overall it has been terrific. One time I was in New Jersey at Midnight and I had to get to a town on the coast. It directed me right to it once I put the correct address in. It is very rare when it cannot connect to the satellite, but you should have a backup map just for an alternative. I love it around metro areas because it can direct you through very difficult traffic patterns. I am so pleased with it I bought my wife one for her birthday."
1,Amagingly Slow,"It takes minutes to find its position. I once drove from Sacramento, CA to San Francisco, CA. With the open sky in the central California Valley, the Magellan found its position when I passed Stockton, CA (50 minutes after the trip started). After I stopped for gas there and the Magellan took minutes again to find its position.I promptly returned the Magellan and got the Navman PiN 100 for half the price. It has its problem too but at least it found its position in less than a minute. The GPS status menu shows that it gets signals from 9 to 10 satellites under the same condition."
2,Another Magellan Goes Wrong...,"I bought this just under two years ago for $1,000 and was quite happy with it until a couple of months ago. It now regularly ""freezes up"" and often can't get a GPS signal for 2 or 3 miles when I start out on a journey. Yesterday, the sound stopped functioning. 6 months after I purchased it, a screen appearted which stated that the maps in its system were ""more than 12 months old"" and invited me to purchase new ones.The price of this product is much more reasonable than when I originally purchased it, so as long as you'll be happy to buy a new one after a couple of years, it will probably work for you."
4,Almost perfect,"I bought this after using a Hertz Neverlost system. I have to say, it is an improvement on that system. The interface is better, more managable, quicker to boot. My only gripe (and its a small one) is the lack of real-time traffic info and navigation workarounds. Otherwise, a good product at a good price (at least on Amazon, i wouldnt pay the ""retail"" on it)"
2,Upgrade and Tech Support are horrible.,"I bought a European model with level 4 software and it works ok in Europe. Forget about upgrading. Forget about expanding to be able to use it in North America. You will spend as much as you would for a new one.Tech support is terrible. The rep did not understand the product, did not speak english very well, and did not even understand my question.Next time, no Magellan."
2,NOT RELIABLE,"I bought my Magellan for $1,000 about 2 years ago. In the last two years, it has frozen up on me twice! The first time I sent it in for repair, it was free, as I had not yet had the unit for a year. I had to call customer service again today (yes, in India), and found out it would be $150 to repair! My boyfriend has the same Magellan, and his sound recently stopped working (also had it for about 2 years). Rather than having to pay repair fees for what seems like every 8 months, I just bought a Garmin today for $250 more! The Magellan 700 was a COMPLETE WAIST of $1,000."
3,Great product bad support,This is a great GPS. In a year you will be prompted every time you turn on the machine to update it. So after a month you will get so sick of seeing this screen you will do it. Well if your like me and the update messes up your unit don't bother contacting support. They just send you a generic response a week later. If your considering this product send them a test email to support to see what I mean. magellantech@thalesnavigation.comI will try another company in hopes it has better support next gps.
4,Updates - ouch!,"I have owned my Magellan RoadMate 700 for about a year. The unit is great! Overall, I have a very positive view of the unit. The two negatives are:1) There are many POIs that are not in the unit.2) Update to Version 5 is $100. However, this may help with problem #1. Garmin updates are free."
1,Don't buy - you can't afford the upgrades!,"I bought this unit 2 years ago. Since then it has been back for repair ro fix a broken antenna lead, and to fix a freezing problem after a (free) software upgrade. Last year I purchased, for $300 additional, the European map database. Exactly 12 months on I was offered the version 5 software update. This brings the unit into line with newer models - ""Saywhere"", Smart detour etc etc, for a reasonable $99. EXCEPT, if you have the European maps as well, the upgrade is $299. AND, if you don't pay the $200 additional, you lose the European maps altogether. I wrote to Magellan complaining about this, and never got an answer. I propose to wait until this unit dies, and then go to another maker."
4,A little dated...,"This product is great, easy to read direction, even tells you when you should make turns. It pretty accurate, but it's a little dated. The 700 doesn't give u a zip code option which is very handing. I say get the 760, or the 800 for an extra 100-200, it's worth it, because it newer cooler and more options. But if you're saving up or not willing to spend that much, the 700 is a great option for you."
2,Customer Service is Abysmal,"The Magellan 700 itself works just fine and is a good product. However, the Magellan customer service is awful. Our brand new product came without the mounting plate. It took many calls to Magellan and unfortunatley they lied numerous times on when the plate would be here. I told them we were leaving on a trip and needed it right away and they said it would be there no problem. I even called back to make sure. The day we were leaving -- NO mounting plate. I called that day and they promised they would overnight it to where I was going. The next day, NO plate. I called again and really complained about their customer service and how they had lied to me twice. The next day I finally received the piece. I will not buy a Magellan product again."
3,Magellan Roadmate 700,"I have had this unit for over 2 years now. I works pretty well once it acquires the satellite signal. It takes about 1-4 minutes to lock on satellites.I have had trouble with the power cradle as DC in pin somehow got bend and is now broken. It costs $70 for a new cradle, so I decided to get a DC jack and solder it. It seems I am not the only one with this problem, search google.Would I buy this specific model again? No. Simply because their are newer, better and cheaper gps sets available now."
2,Magellan RoadMate 700 Horror story!,"I got a e-mail today from Amazon to write a review on this produt I just bought. So here goes. I bought the Magellan RoadMate 700 NEW. It was shipped from Car Toys. When I plugged it in it was not ready to go as advertised. A error message came up stating it did not have the software installed. I called Magellan customer service told them the story & they shipped me a new Magellan RoadMate 700 in exchange for the broken one. I plugged it in & it was ready to go. I used it for a day. Next day when I fired it up, it never got past the user prompt. It frooze. I called customer service again told them the story & they exchanged yet another Magellan RoadMate 700. It has been a month since the last exchange, the Roadmate operates as advertised. This is a good product, you need to be lucky to get one that works on the first shot."
4,Good system with 1 drawback,"The system is flawless, fast recalculations and easy to understand.Drawback to system: To update your maps they want an additional $100, this is insane, I can see $50 at most because most other companies do this map update as a courtesy.I would buy this product again for this price $300, but not more because I have to purchase upgrades"
2,froze and faded,"This is the second magellen I have had the first was smashed and this was my fault.I took the first to europe and it was great. the second I bought I just returned to amazon. I had this a month.it brought me to two wrong locations then one day the screen just froze and faded away ,could not get it back.not great"
1,Good GPS but has a weak spot. Do not buy,"I have owned this unit for 2 1/2 years. Thought it was great. The unit receives its power from a cradle that it snaps into. It seems that these cradles have a tendency to fail and then the unit is useless until you buy a new cradle for $50.00. The failure rate is so high that Magellan was out of cradles for three months. This is a definate defect in the cradle and Magellan should replace all of the Roadmate 700 and 760's with a free unit of comperable features. I paid over $700 for my unit in May, 2005 and another $100 to upgrade it with new maps and firmware one year later. This is my biggest regret to date."
1,Never again,"The gps system I recieved was nothing more than a stripped down, unusuable piece of crap. It was like getting a car without the engine or wheels. I thought no accessories would mean additional frills or chargers, a case, etc. I did not think if would mean useless. Matt Stoelk said I could buy the working parts from Amazon for $15 or less. No cradle, no antenna, no plug. Very poor experience. This was for my grandson, and it was very dissappointing. Amazon has always been terrific, and I do not fault them."
3,Be advised,"Be advised that a software update (version 5) is due out at the end of December 2005 or in January 2006 (according to Magellan customer service). I was told that the software will convert the 700 essentially to a 760, but you will have to pay for the update even if you recently purchased the 700 unit. They could not tell me how much the update would cost."
1,"No price, no need to buy","If Amazon is unwilling to put the price on the informtion page, one must wonder why!"
4,Magellan 700 GPS,"Good unit to upgrade cars that don't have this feature - amazingly accurate. Screen has good contrast and is easy to read. Like the way it recalculates the route automatically if you don't follow its direction, and ability to choose route by shortest, fastest, etc. Found the instruction manual frustrating and difficult to use - tells you to do something, but not how to get to the screen necessary to do it. Learning unit by trial and error. Overall happy with it."
2,Sound died after 14 months will cost a lot to fix,"THe unit was running fine for a year, excellent with directions and voice prompts. It was running fine and all of a sudden the sound died in the middle of a voice prompt. It came back for a few seconds at another prompt and that was it. Seems to be some hardware soldering problem. DOn't know how much will it cost but about 100 bucks or more. I wish I had the extended warranty. Do not buy the Magellan Product without extended warranty. I have researched on quality of cusomter service of magellan and found a lot of ppl complaining about this product. I would go out and buy a sony with 4 year warranty for $499.99 + $59.99 from sonystyle.If anyone had it fixed for the same problem please advice me."
3,Not Too Sure,"Well, I'm not too sure whether mine works properly or not? I bought the system a week ago and so far it has never worked properly, once I turn it on, the system could not detect where I am and takes 5 minutes to finally knows where I am...and if it detects where I am..after awhile, it would suddenly try to reposition us and would end up at the wrong location, also when I'm about to pass the state line of VA/DC/MD it would be lost again and detects us at the wrong place...I'm going to return it and get a new system and hopefully it would work correctly."
4,Never leave home without it.,I purchased my first Roadmate in August 2004. Since then I have taken it to various places in North America. It's gotten me out of some tight spaces. I've never gotten lost while using it.I purchased the second one when the voice interface on the first failed. I sent it in for repair. (The extended warranty had just run out about 2 weeks earlier) The new RoadMate arrived in two days and has worked fine ever since. The old Roadmate was returned to me repaired in about a week.I gave the first one to my wife and she has used it with success ever since.Pros: Easy to use. Amazing detail.Cons: Sometimes takes a long time to acquire satellitesOriginal mount is useless after about a month. I got aftermarkettripod for each unit and they seem to work fine. Software updatesare expensive.
1,Outdated maps,"This product has a problem: You pay over 1000 dollars, and the maps are a decade old. There is rarely a trip where the GPS doesn't chase me off a highway, through a small town, just because it has no clue where the highway is. If you purchase this, be sure you purchase a street atlas to verify the directions you get from this GPS. I happen to own an outdated Garmin Street Pilot V and thought this would be a superior unit, but the Garmin at least has accurate maps. 1200 bucks wasted."
2,Problems with signal acquisition,"I purchased the Magellan 700 and took it on a trip to the Dallas area the first week. After a few days of owning this unit, it finally found where I was and performed quite well the first day or two in Dallas. We drove up to Richardson and lost the signal completely for about 4 hours. We only re-acquired it as we were returning to our hotel! The unit for some reason thought we were in Georgia! I am unable to fathom why I paid 1200 dollars for a machine for which I probably need an external antenna at extra cost. It should work well as is for that price! I am regrettably returning the unit for a refund. I am wondering if the Garmin has better signal retention?"
1,Great for the first year,"It worked for the first 15 months. It stopped acquiring the satellites after 3 months past the warrenty. I called the tech support, which is India, and was told to try a few things. They did not work. I paid 155 dollars plus shipping to have it repaired. It came back, without an explanation of what was wrong. It worked for 3 weeks and the same problem happened again. One thing that I should mention is that there was no problems until I upgraded the software (another 100 dollars). Could it be that they have a bug in the upgrade????I would never buy anything from that company again."
1,Antenna Sucks,"Very slow start-up (sometimes 5-10 minutes to acquire a signal.) This is incredibly annoying when you need to get somewhere and must pull over and wait several minutes for directions. Five minutes seems like an eternity when you're running late. I'm no GPS engineer, but I believe the unit is slow because the antenna/hardware sucks, and no amount of software upgrades will fix this - especially in newer cars with heat reflective coatings in the windshield. (For existence my '05 Honda.) The upgrade from version 3 to version 4 costs $99, so make sure ver 4 is included. Ver 5 will release Dec '05, so wait and see if they really can fix the problem. Bottom line - I'll just buy a Garmin next time. I have not heard of similar problems with their equipment."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"Bought this due to its price. I immediately encountered outdated maps. No problem - just download the update from the website right? Right - for $99!! They sell me an outdated semi useless device and want me to pay $99 to update to what it should have been when I bought it? I don't think so. Called the useless customer service people. ""Nothing we can do, sorry."" Wrote email. No response. Called customer service again. ""Sorry, nothing we can do."" The routes this thing picked were also ridiculous. Returned the unit. End of story. Good luck if you choose to ignore this."
1,Not as good a value as I thought,"The Magellan is adequate, but just is too clunky. The interfaces are not as intuitive as Garmin's new Quest or C330. I wasn't happy with my Magellan. The antenna didn't seem to keep signal very well and I couldn't get the position very well adjusted to stay out further on my dash, because of its design. If I put the unit way out there, it was so far out it became harder to read the text. Returned it for a Garmin C330. Much better."
5,"RoadMate 700 -- Expensive, but worth it!","I've been using the ""built in"" GPS in my Lexus for more than a year, and I've found it so useful I wanted one for my wife's car. Having used the RoadMate 700 for a couple of months now, I can say that I'm very happy with it. It lacks a couple of features that my ""built in"" system has, but otherwise it works very well. The only downside I've noticed that it takes a little long to recalculate a route if you've strayed off the original route; my ""built in"" system responds within a couple of seconds, while the RoadMate can take up to a minute. All in all, it's a good system and I'm happy I bought it."
3,garmin 2620 vs Magellan 700,"I bought two GPS devices at the same time: Magellan 700 and Garmin 2620. After the 3 days of testing, I decided to keep Garmin and return Magellan.Magellan 700:pros: 20GB hard drive which contains North America and Europe maps (have to buy the access code to use Europe map, more than 15GB is useless), bigger LCD, internal speaker, simple interface that is easy to use.cons: Take more time to pick up signal from satellites. The interface is so simple, non-professional that lacks alot of features.garmin 2620:pros: control by touch screen and a remote control. fast picking up signal, the interface is the best which includes many professional features such as: routing multiple addresses, traffic avoidance....cons: 2.2GB hard drive which contains only North America map, small LCD.Since its interface is prof, it takes more time to learn for beginners."
2,Not enough points of interest,"I was trying to search Barnes and Noble bookstore from this GPS unit but it started giving me bookstores in NY when I was located in VA. There is no way to sort the search result by proximity. I tried many other place I generally go, but the GPS could not find them. This works best when you want to locate Restaurants, gas stations and ATMs. But it will not work if you want to find a specific type of restaurant like Thai/Indian etc. For getting directions, I find Google maps much better and accurate than this GPS. Google Local's (local.google.com) ""find business"" fuction is far superior and extensive. There are some good things in this GPS but definitely not worth this price. (Like you can locate where you are in any unknown places )I am going to return this and try Garmin GPS instead."
2,If they only iron out the problems,"My Roadmate 700 arrived about 2 weeks ago. I loved the features, ease of use, and accuracy. About a week later the unit kept shutting itself off. There seemed to be a problem with the power connector that plugs into the cradle. I called Magellan Technical Support, which is very responsive, and they had me return the unit for a new. My new unit arrived today and inside of an hour it died. Magellan is now sending me another unit. If it worked I would rate it 5 stars but I am skeptical about the quality of the product. The mounting bracket is terrible but Magellan will replace it free of charge with a suction cup mount. I really like the unit and hope I get one that really works."
5,It works so well it's scarry!,"The Magellan RoadMate 700 is all that it is made out to be, plus. Accurate within feet and holds satellite signals very well. I have not yet used all of the options but I believe it's presence on my dash board has already helped sell this product to many of my friends. The address capacity is more than anyone would need but it could use additional points of interest and, ironically in these days of secularism, perhaps church locations."
3,It is good when it works,"I have Magellan almost one year. It picks a satelite signal not always right away when starting. Sometimes it can be up to 5 min. Like tree month ago it started a power problem. Do not turn on,and when it finally turns on it can by itself turns off in tree min after work. I send email to magellan.com asking how can I repire this issue. For price $800 what I paid for it it is not worth for the money. I prefered if it can work at least for 3 years without a problem. They have a new product RoadMate 360 and it cost on Amazon.com $430. I woul better buy that one, if you need a GPS. I hope that should be better and has everything that has 700 and more like Puerto Rica map pre-loaded."
2,Not happy,"I bought Magellan RoadMate 700 Vehicle GPS 2 months back and its not working as expected. its very poor in locating the the place and sometimes don't even work. Many times this sytem got hung and power off and on again is the solution to get it work again.Might this product is very good in market, but I got the bad piece."
1,Great (when it is working),"I had the garmin 2610 and the magellan 700, The 700 is very easy to use and much easier to veiw. With the 2610 it will sometimes lead you the wrong way. The 700 gives you the right directions 99.8% of the time. I liked it very much, but after going through two of them, I returned it and got 2610, Which I have had no problems. Both of the magellan unit failed, one about a day after I got it. The other one lasted about two weeks, I gave up and got a 2610. The more I use it, the more I like it."
3,AC Power Adapter for 700,Someone mentioned Radio Shack sells generic AC Power Adapter can be used for Roadmate 700. ($20) Can I have the exact specs for the AC Power Adapter? Thanks.
1,Dud,I spent days trying to get the system to find the satellite signal and it would not work. Contacting technical support was difficult but I spoke with 2 different people-the second one finally told me it was non-functional and send it back. It was a great disappointment as it was the X-Mas gift for my wife and now she dowsn't want anything to do with one of these duds.John
1,If you want this buy from someone else,"We purchased the Magellan 700 GPS but because of one attempted, and failed, delivery by UPS Amazon canceled our order. Amazon suggested we place another order but in the meantime Amazon jacked the price up $50. Go elsewhere on the web to purchase, don't use Amazon."
3,POOR INSTRUCTIONS,I WROTE IT ONCE AND YOU LOST IT - NEED FOR OUTSIDE ANTENNA. A RADION SHACK THAT HAD ON ON THWE SHELF WAS NOT AWARE OF GHE NEED. WE TALKED TYHE THE DIDTRIBUTOR IN CA AND THAT SAIS IT WAS BACK ORDERED.
5,Lost Berlin a Great Find,"Wonderful photographs and narrative; this book captures the life and spirit of Berlin during its heyday. The final few pages address the emergence of the Nazi influence; other books thus are left to relate the ensuing horror that befell Berlin. One of my favourite Berlin books. Also worth a read are ""Before the Deluge"" and ""Faust's Metropolis"", two excellent books which cover Berlin in the 20's and 30's."
1,"The vendor was awesome to deal with. The product however, was terrible.","The quality of the unit was poor, wouldn't read discs properly.Accessories missing from a sealed box, very bad reviews.I should of researched further before buying."
2,Too many repairs,"Fun rig when it works. I've owned it almost 2 years and am on the 3rd repair for Laser Assembly, which won't read. It tends to go out approximately every 6 months. I have to haul it to Dallas for repairs by Vocopro approved tech's. Getting tired of that, the expense and time out having to go back in several weeks to pick it up & $$$; it is a two hour drive one way.I would not recommend this Gig Master to anyone...bad quality from Vocopro. I will buy components next time from Numark or a another company. No more Vocopro products for me."
5,GigMaster well worth the price!,"I've been a VocoPro equipment user for many years -- most recently the Bravo ""self-contained"" unit (since discontinued) and have been impressed with the GigMaster's performance. I use it for home and for parties and it delivers excellent sound -- even more so when hooked up for external 200W VocoPro vocal speakers. The S-Video hookup allows for high quality display and makes me wonder how I put up with coaxial connections for all these years. Unlike the Bravo, I have had no problems playing ""non-standard"" CD+G discs (including ""home-made"" versions) and the DVD feature is great for entertainment between Karaoke sets (think classic MTV videos on a special disc set). Love the delay/reverb feature for echo on songs that need it for effect. This unit is actually better and more versatile than many of the ""pro sets"" I see at local Karaoke pubs.All in all, a great purchase at a very good price. Really don't think you can find better quality and value for around $500."
4,Simple operation,"The machine is very easy to operate and I use the key-changing feature frequently. I've used a Bravo and a Twister and this machine is comparable. I was a little disappointed in the audio output, and it is also difficult to ""steer"" with the attached handle. I prefer to transport it on a dolly. Overall, I am satisfied with the GigMaster."
2,Nice while it worked,"Very nice, heavy, and portable for three months. Then it went dead. Is it worth repairing? There are no local dealers, and it will cost over $200.00 to ship one way. The power went dead, and I tried the fuse and power cord. I have no idea what to do with this thing now."
4,Best Portable Karaoke Machine,"GigMaster Pro is a solid machine that allows hall-filling sound with many manual adjustments. Able to play MP3 CDs and also CD-G discs is first for VocoPro. Cabinet is solid and Music Equalizer allows flexibility of one touch ""off"" convenience. Speakers are powerful and overall sound is pleasantly smooth up to at least 50% volume adjustments.Fidelity could have been better, although out of all portable ""all in one"", this may be the best sounding. Vocal effects adjustments are ""digital"", but there are only 3 (echo, reverb and delay) , thus not many options like other non-karaoke amplifier-mixer or separate effects processor.Overall, worth every penny and will fill up a large hall with beautiful sound and options to plug in Guitar, Key Board or more speakers."
5,Loved it!,"I actually had the pleasure of taking a course with Inchausti before I read his book. So many of the ideas and stories in Spitwad Sutras were those that he used in our class, so I was able to compare how effective they'd been. The only problem some people might have with it are the religious overtones; however, I feel they only add to the charm of the book. I wasn't able to put it down once--read it straight through! Inchausti offers much wisdom to those new to teaching. Give this book a read; it'll help you when you start teaching, or it might be able to revive the spark you had when you first started. Well worth the money!"
5,The best dessert book ever!,I LOVE this dessert book! I have made several recipes from it and all of them are wonderful. I always have people asking me for the recipes!
2,Not quite what I wanted,"Nicely filmed, but be warned--this short video doesn't really doesn't tell you much about the Kern River at all, just how to use four different techniques on it. A first time visitor to the Kern would probably have to hire this guy as a guide to figure out the spots he was fishing.It would have been better if they would have shown some maps of the area relative to other features nearby; they could have discussed what times of the year are best--things like that. If they'd have spent at least an hour and discussed some of those things, it would have been way more useful.I am glad I bought a used copy from an Amazon vendor--otherwise I would have felt pretty ripped off."
5,Smoke Herb,"This guy speaks the truth. Before reading forget all prior knowledge to hemp and marijuana. You are in for an enlighting experience. So sit back, take a toke, and be prepared to learn. :)"
4,Conspiracy,I could only find this book used. It was as expected though. The pages were not too yellow. Now I just have to find the time to read it.
4,Para Hispano Parlantes,"Recibí este dvd el Lunes 7 de Noviembre. Venía suelto en su caja pero después de limpiarlo me dí cuenta de que no estaba rayado. Aunque la mayor parte no me interesaba, porque mi único interés era Ray Vecchio, me dí el trabajo de verlo completo para dar una opinión con base (aunque sea parcializada).No le doy una puntuación excelente porque:- David Marciano aparece menos de lo que yo quisiera. Aunque eso ya lo sabía.- Aunque su calidad es menor que la de otros dvds que tengo (hay una continua, pero delicada pixelación), es bastante buena en relación con mis VHS.- No trae extras.- No trae la traducción original en Castellano.- No tiene subtítulos en ningún idioma, y ni siquiera tiene close-caption.En conclusión, lo único bueno de este dvd, pero que hace que valga la pena comprarlo, es poder deleitarse con el regreso del verdadero Ray Vecchio a Chicago.Claudia"
4,"Basic, but sufficient","The last episodes (and easily among the best) of Due South are presented here with no frills or extras, but with good quality sound and picture. (A bit like Fraser himself, if you think about it.) The two parter is presented exactly as it aired, complete with two sets of opening and closing credits and a ""previously on Due South,"" at the beginning of the second episode (which covers the episode you have most likely just finished watching).Still, this episode represents all that is best about Due South, the humor (and slight absurdity, especially with the para-Mounties, parachuting in to save the day in their dress uniforms), the touching (the story of Fraser's mother's death is dealt with), and the wonderful wit of the writers. Add in the appearance of both Ray Vecchios, an especially good soundtrack (above even Due South's average high standards), and the glimpse into the future for the main characters, and you've got an episode that is well worth owning."
2,Unnecessary buy,"Without warning this item was already included in Due South: Season Three(4DVD pack), so I bought a double, when I ordered Season 3 and this.Otherwise OK as Due South go."
1,Don't Buy If You Already Own Due South DVD's!,If you own the season 3 American Release or the season 4 Canadian Release of Due South then you already own this 2 episode wrap up of the show. There is nothing new on this dvd.
4,Good DVD but get the book first....,"So I made the mistake of getting the DVD before I bought the book. Get the book first so that you can actually see what you are playing.The show the notes on the screen but they are quite blurry. This is a great book and DVD for beginners. You do not need to be able to read music to enjoy learning to play the dulcimer. She goes through ton of standard tunes and takes you though a few modes. I would suggest actually learning the notes and not relying on the tablature forever, but what can I say, I am a musician and I like people to expand their musical boundaries. This book and DVD is a good start."
5,Great beginner's guide to dulcimer playing!,"This is a great beginner's video for teaching yourself how to play the Appalachian (also known as mountain, lap, or fretted) dulcimer.Madeline MacNeil has a soothing voice, and takes it slow. She shows how to start with very simple tunes, demonstrating techniques patiently.If you want to begin to play the dulcimer, and don't want to pay for expensive lessons, this is the way to start."
3,Don't buy without the book!!!,The tab on the dvd is so blurry you need the book to follow along with the songs. I briefly watched the video once but I won't watch it again until I get the book that goes with it. I would not recommend buying just the dvd.
3,Comprehensive teaching tool!,The dulcimer is indeed a beautiful sounding instrument! This DVD covers everything one needs to know to get started! Madeline MacNeil is a wonderful teacher!
4,Great music that won't annoy adults,"I'm a big Los Lobos fan, and was thrilled to find some music that my 2-year-old and I can both enjoy. The songs aren't annoying or childish. There is a bit too much narration for my tastes, but my toddler seems to enjoy it. There is Spanish spoken, but the story is completely understandable to non-spanish speakers. My sister and her two Mexican-American children also enjoy it."
5,Outstanding,"Los Lobos teams up with Lalo Guerrero to take children on an extraordinary adventure and musical tour. I don't know who has enjoyed this CD more -- my children or their parents! We've been trying to learn Spanish as a family, and this has been a wonderful, fun supplement to our language lessons. Some of the songs are in English, but many are in Spanish, and all the lyrics are helpfully printed in the liner notes."
5,very pleased,The book that I bought was in excellent condition. I don't think it has ever been used. I'm extremely happy with my purchase.
4,Really Suprised,"I bought this album after hearing ""What's Good for Me"" on the What A Girl Wants soundtrack. I figured if it had one or two good songs, it would be worth it. I was really shocked when I listened to the album! It's a great album full of insightful lyrics and rocking music! Lucy should not be written off as a Michelle Branch wannabe, this girl can truly stand on her own. From sassy numbers like, ""The Breakdown"" and ""Trust Me (You Don't Wanna See This)"" to thoughtful reflections like, ""Standing"" and ""Something"", Lucy expresses her ideas and experiences through her amazing lyrics. I highly recommend this album if you like Michelle Branch/Sheryl Crow-sytle music. Lucy's debut album is fun to listen to all the way through and will have you singing along in no time!"
3,Generic pop/rock,"I got this album as a free promo, so it was at least worth every penny I paid. I checked reviews here before I snagged the promo, and was fairly excited to see other reviews compare Ms. Woodward favorably to artists like Avril Lavigne and Pink. I'm not a die-hard fan of either, but I like their music well enough. However, I was sorely disappointed by Ms. Woodward's music. I'd equate her more with Britney Spears or Christina Aguilara, neither of whom I appreciate at all. She had some angst in her music, some bitterness and all, but it seemed very prefabricated and artificial. Add onto that some very weak lyrical work (rhyming 'way' with 'away' does not earn my undying respect for her writing skills), and you get a fairly uninteresting album. I didn't hate it, it didn't hurt to listen to this music, but I'm just glad I didn't pay good money for it."
2,"A few good songs, none worth remembering","I an dissapointed with Maxim in featuring this artist. While Lucy has a reasonable voice and fluffy pop music that is certainly going to be popular with those who like bubble gum music, this album comes out like many pop albums. That is, there is one pseudo hit (always the first track) and then track after track of filler. I feel this artist could do more but she gets an underachiever's grade for this release.I like female artists in general, however she barely reaches beyond the total generic bubble gum experience that plagues our airwaves. We don't need more of this musical spam. Buy this album if you need to placate a bunch of pre-teens and attempt to sound current, however if you like music worth listening to, it would be better to find another artist that is willing to risk a little effort to create something that expresses something, anything. The lack of creativity and boilerplate sound simply leaves me cold on this artist.This album is pablum."
4,Better then I expected,"When I first heard of this girl I thought UGH another wannabe britney. But this girl can actually sing. Good beats and great lyrics. For someone who wrote her herself, I give it 4 stars."
1,What is this book about?,"This book was given to me by a friend (Probably because he didn't want to read it). I read the first chapter and it actually sounded exciting at first. By the time I had finished the 3rd chapter I was asking myself ""What the h*** was this book about?"". It seemed to have absolutely no relevance to programming whatsoever and very little relevance to anything at all! This book is just as incoherent as his collaboration with William Robert Stanek on ""Java 2 Certification Exam Guide for Programmers and Developers"" but at least that book seemed to be about something and stayed on topic (For at least 60% of the book). After reading 2 of this guy's books I am left wondering ""Did this guy ever actually learn English? Or did he tranlate these books from some bizzare alien langauge?"" This book should have seriously been called ""Magic C*ap Programmer's Cookbook""!"
4,Nice product,"I purchased this to fertalize and seed about 6 acres around the horse farm. Its not easy to calibrate (but then again neither is my 1000# frontier 3pt spreader). I could not mount it on the front of my ATV due to the winch, but it mounted fine on the rear rack. Its very easy to disconnect and my 25 gallon sprayer will still fit on the back of the ATV even with the mounting bracket in place. I will be taking it to the other farm to fertilize the smaller food plots so I dont have to waste time hooking up three point implements on the tractor."
1,Do not buy for salt!!,I bought this unit to add to my quad for salting after I plow. Big mistake. It does not flow salt at all. I called the mfg before I purchased it to specifically ask about salt. They said it did. The box says salt on it but it simply doesn't work. Returning it tomorrow.
2,Needs more thought in the design.,"The brackets for mounting this work as a nice hinge. This unit tilts when not tied to the rack. Buyers needs to include some sort of support bracket or strap to keep this from tilting backwards. I used a tie-down strap so I can adjust the tension based on the load. I do like how well it disperses. It makes my life much easier. Just a little more thought into the mounting/restraint design, and you have a good product."
3,Not 5mm!,"These are listed as 5mm cables, but they are not. They are very thin 2.2mm cables. Seem to work OK, but I'm a little disheartened to see mislabeled merchandise on Amazon."
3,Works but very thin cord,"I needed a 15 foot cable to go from my AVR to my HTPC and ordered this. The cable works fine and does what it should. However, I would be very scared to get a kink or anything in the line because it is pretty much paper thin."
3,its ok for common use,"I saw a lot of comments about it not staying in place. However, it does stay in place if you gently push the ends in till you hear it snap. It will fit loosely unless you push it in correctly. It is not as good as the one pictured. It is thinner and more brittle. It works well for simple use though."
5,Good Little Cable at a Great Price,"Very decent cable, and it does the job its supposed to. Why spend tons of cash on Monster cables, when you can pick up several of these at a much lower cost, and have spares. Cable works fine. It is a bit thin, but it is just going to sit there and be undisturbed."
2,Flimsy Toslink On The Cheap,"It looks exactly like it's pictured but when it arrived, I was disappointed. It may look thick in the pictures but the casing for the wire is very flimsy. If you bend this wrong, It feels like you could damage something inside the insulation. Other than the the durability in question, it works when plugged in and fits. Just wish it didn't feel like like one of those coffee stirrer straws they pass out at starbucks."
1,Cable Fitting Problem,"I should have been more cautious on these after reading some reviews, but I experienced the same issue many others have. The cable falls out of my devices instead of making a firm fit. I have tried this on 4 different devices (Samsung LED TV, Apple TV box, Directv Box, Surround Sound Receiver). None of the fittings were good, and the cable simply fell out of every one. To top if off, I could never even confirmed if this cable worked or not as a result. I tried to contact the seller, but we'll see what that results in. If they follow-up with me and replace their product with a good working version, I'll update my review accordingly."
2,Loose connection,"While one end of this fit quite well into the receiver, the other end will not click/snap into the TV. Ended up having to attach it with a tape."
4,It works,"What more can you ask for, it works well. I use it to get my hometheater pc to play sound through my surround sound speakers. Sound is great."
5,Works great,What else can I say. Ran this from my Windows 7 Media Center to Sony sound receiver. Sound is perfect and the quality is good.
4,Cable looks beefer in the picture,"The cable looks much thicker in the picture than what I received. Bought it based on that. But, I guess for the price, it's about right. Connected easily and works. So, I guess it's all good."
5,FO Cable,The cable came quickly as promised and fulfills the job as intended. Sound quality is superb and would order again if needed. Thanks to EEK for the quick order:)
3,"good, but .......","Well when I opened the package I thought it was a joke something so thin might serve. Previous mind had bought a cable but the thickness was normal but this seems to lie. Well my husband put it, believe it works. ??"
2,What are Silica Fiber Optic cables?,"It seriously looks like that stupid terminator scene with the liquid metal? I think it actually eats blood literally or something?Haven't seen a mosquito or anything in a while this year....... ???? Just saying, I'm from China anyways and this communism thing doesn't really work on me, why don't you people just tell the truth?"
1,Not the greatest cord I have ever seen,plugs at the end are hard to tell in the dark which way they need to be inserted into my amplifier.
5,Works like a champ.,Item is great. Worked as advertised. Needed it to connect my PS3 to my surround sound.Not much more I can say.
1,TOSlink Cable,Cheap and cable's outside protective coating is non-existent. Bends too easily anddoesn't look anything like the picture displayed on the Amazon web page.
5,"Cheap to buy, but works great!","For a 12' optical audio cable, you may spend more than $20 anywhere else. However, this $5 cable just works fine without any problems. I do not see any reasons to buy a more expensive product."
5,works!,Works like a charm. No problems with it at all. It does what its suppose to do. You won't have any problems as I didn't.
3,The cable keeps falling out!,"Overall the sound quality is good, no different than a more expensive digital cable..... Problem is for some reason it keeps coming out, some reason it doesn't completely fit tight enough!.... Not sure why, but also heard another reviewer say the same thing....."
5,"Falls out, doesn't work (wrong: it doesn't fall out and it works!!!)","Read Update after originalOriginal Review:Agree with most of the 1 star reviews. No firm fit, the cable falls out easily. Initially I tried to use it for a new connection in my setup and it didn't work. I tried to use it instead of another optical cable that I use in my setup and it still didn't work. Bad product. Don't buy.Update:It's hard to acknowledge that I'm an idiot :) Anyway, I am. And the reason is - I didn't remove plastic covers from the tips of the plugs. Once I realized that and actually removed them everything went in place and started working properly. So forget about my original 1 star and now I'm giving it 5."
1,Both cats threw up for a long time,"Both of my cats (age 11) threw up for an extended period after eating just 3 of these. Into the trash they go (not the cats, the treats). Not sure what they were reacting to but thought it would be good to let other cat parents know the risk."
1,Temptations Vomiting,I have two cats. My big boy has eaten these and never had a problem...as a matter of fact he has never vomited or had a hair ball since I adopted him at 2 months. My girl cat throws up every time she eats this particular flavor. Since I treat them equally these are no longer purchased. I hate to see my girl sick so I just recommend you watch your cats after you give them these treats. If not a problem...carry on.
1,Causes Vomitting!,"I've tried it with both my cats, several times. Every time they eat this, and other Whiskas Temptations products, they vomit within minutes.They LOVE it, they WANT it, it's CHEAP but it makes them puke, so, I'd consider this a bad purchase."
1,Not safe for kittens!,"I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package."
1,Makes Some Cats Vomit,"You know, I was searching the Internet for the words ""temptations"" and ""vomit"" when I came across these reviews. I was surprised to hear that I'm not the only one who has had problems with this product. Within an hour of eating these treats my cat vomits for about 40 minutes. I didn't realize it was the cause until the second time I fed them to her. It's really bad because it doesn't cause the cat to throw up all at once. It's like she can just vomit a little at a time and you're forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit ((or locking her in the bathroom (which is horrible))."
1,Sick Cats,"I have fed my 2 cats these treats the last 2 days. Within 5 minutes of eating them, they are both throwing up. I will be going back to the Three Dog Bakery Treats. Expensive but have never made my cats sick. Why is the company not responding to so many bad reviews?"
5,These are Fabulous!,"I was reminded of my mother's cat when I read the comments about vomiting. Mom's cat gulps the Whiskas Temptations WHOLE and resembles a Kirby vaccuum! If you inhaled your food, you would vomit too! With my kitties, it is an entirely different story - they love them, they chew them, they purr. These are not a dietary supplement, they are a TREAT. I even managed to train my eldest kitty to ""shake hands"" using Temptations. I will definately buy them, again and again."
1,Vomit alert,Two out of three of my cats vomited within 10 minutes of eating just a single one of these treats. I'm talking empty-their-stomach-completely vomit. Poor kitties. I threw away the bag of treats immediately.
2,toooooo much narration!,"I have enjoyed several Cities of the World travel DVDs distributed by Travel Video Store prior to this one and Tuscany. While the photography remains quite good and the sites presented well balanced, in both these the narrator seems to think more is better. In both the narration is a rapid-fire sing-song delivery which to me and my wife quickly detracts from the enjoyment of the video. Reducing the narrative to one half or preferably one third of what is given would allow a more measured pleasant delivery and avoid the relentless drone with which the viewer is barraged!"
2,Fine until you wash,"I thought these towels were so cute, but when you wash them they fall apart. The material started to unravel and continued the more they were washed. I also thought they were small. I would recommend buying some really nice soft adult towels if you want the towels to grow with your kids!"
4,The Murphy treatment,"It took me some time searching for this album on CD. I have a record but fungus have got to it. His adventurous arrangement of"" A Fifth of Beethoven "" was simply "" unheard of "" when it was included along with the Bee Gees in John Travolta disco movie hit - Saturday Night Fever. All the tracks have the Murphy treatment. Strictly for those who like creativity in their music and enjoy new musical directions. Its a pity that one can't get hold of his second album on CD ( again fungus have got to mine )."
4,"1,000 capacity?","I ordered these casters advertised as 1,000 lb. casters. They say 300 lbs. on the box and a sticker is pasted that says 1,000 lbs. I am hoping they are actually the greater value and not what the box says. They seem to be fine so far but I have not loaded them up yet."
3,they are ok,"So far they are doing the job. What I don't like is they are imported from China, I try to buy American whenever I could"
5,great product awesome price quick shipping,"Great product, awesome price, quick shipping! The cable even came with dust caps at this low price I purchased same type cable from local Radio Shack a while ago. It was 3x the price with no dust caps. Great Company to order from rcvd cable in less than 5 days!"
1,This cable is junk...........,YUK....Don't waste money on this connector. The male connectors are so cheaply formed that they don't properly fit either my VIZIO TV or VIZIO sound-bar. Had to go out and replace immediately. Buy a known brand and pay a few more bucks!
5,Bit carrier works just fine!,"When it comes to transferring digital information from one component to another, as long as the bits are all carried then there is no difference in quality of the signal. This optical cable works just fine and carries all the digital information provided. There is no reason to spend more on optical cable as you will NOT improve the signal. At this low a price, I don't see how they make a profit. This is all the optical cable I needed and my system sounds great. There is no reason to spend more when this does the job. And does it just fine."
5,its a quarter people!,"For 25 cents, I cannot be happier. Used this with a optical to copper (coaxial) converter...works seamlessly, no perceptible audio quality difference."
4,Works,Cable seems like it's sturdy enough and it works on both my fiber TV set-top box and my DVD player. I even am running into a fiber optic switch box that takes two inputs and switches them between one output to the receiver and they all work just fine. I have not experienced any problems with them other than they don't fit as snugly as other cables I've used in the past... but they still work.
1,Hate it.,The unit did not function as specified. I was not able to accomplish the task that it was purchased for.
4,"its a handy product, i Have what I paid for it","I recomend this product because its cost efectiveYou will obtain what you paid for it, works like any other fiber optic cable, but very inexpensive"
2,Will get you listining to sorround sound and thats all.,These optical cables are the weakest I've seen but I haven't seen but a few brands. I would have never bought these as a gift to help others get there hdtv's going if I knew how they were going to look in person. I said geez these are flimzy and peuny but accepted them as good gesture anyways. I am just writing this to let others know that don't expect much cause I thought they'ld be like the amazon basics I've got myself yrs back...I was wrong.
2,VERY CHEAP PRODUCT. BETTER OUT THERE,"Very inexpensive but for the price, there are MUCH BETTER cables for the money. Shop around before picking this cable."
4,good service but these cables are work,Arrived on time in good shape works fine. But these cables are hard to connect and difficult to keep well connected! Hope someone comes up with a better method than this.
4,Good value,Bought this cable to connect my TV to sony home theater . Working perfectly well . Using this for the last 2 weeks .
5,GREAT,Why in the world are these cables so expensivein other places? This is the perfect length for myneeds...and works perfectly. THANKS
3,thin thin thin,"This optical cable works. I would hate to move it around much. When you hear people saying thin - believe them. This ""3 FT Digital Audio Optical TOSLink Cable"" looks like a small breeze would chop it in half. Of course, it is cheap,.. and it does work."
2,cheap,"product is super cheap, but i payed a cheap price for it. Don't know if it really makes a difference anyways."
3,Thin short cable,Cable seems rather fragile. It is very thin.Good for small spaces. It does perform to expectations providing good optical signal.
3,Good for the price,Perfect for the price. Sound quality seems to be pretty good. Especially since I'm running it through a splitter switch.
4,Great for money,"Sound is as good as higher name brands like monster, but that can't change very much for these cables. I hooked it up from my PS3 to surround sound and it works like a charm the only worry I have is the very inexpensive build quality. This one may be much less than others but it certainly will not last as long if it is moved around a lot. But if it is staying in one place for a long time then it's a great deal."
2,Flimsy cable,"TOSLink Cable is so thin I can't believe it conducts anything. I have some fishing line that is thicker than this. Optical extension coupler works, but I will have to use electrical tape to keep coupler and cable together. Fit is rather loose. If this stuff was half the price I would stilll feel I paid to much for it. You should probably pay a few extra bucks and get good stuff. CMPL delivered on time as stated on invoice."
1,Poor cheaply made Cables,"You might as well take you $3 and throw it away. These cables are basically just the fiber optic cable coated with the thinnest piece of rubber that they could find. They're thin and flimsy and any kind of kink in the cable will reduce the signal. Good quality cables do not do this. I'm not saying Monster, just something that costs about $7 or $8. If you connect these, they seem to work ok, if you flex it, you will actually hear the signal degrade. I've learn that in using optical cables, they do need to be quality made and these are not them. Spend a bit more and live happily ever after."
4,S/PDIF 3' Audio Cable,"After waiting 8 days, this audio cable finally arrived.It works fine, except when I initially inserted the connection into my hdtv, the plug felt loose because of its tendency to turn in awkward directions, but after a couple of twists on the cable, the connection fit great.The audio cable in my opinion is durable and functional, just remember to take the transparent plugs off before inserting it into your tv/audio source.I give it a three stars on audio quality because I have a 2-channel sound bar without a subwoofer. (not the cable's fault)"
2,Beware! Plastic tip breaks off,"This product works great if you plan on plugging a unit in and leaving it.For me I take my headset systems every where, so I'm constantly unplugging and replugging it.Eventually the plastic covering the optical signal broke off and got stuck in my optical switch and in my Xbox.The quality is not good so I would stay away from this product."
4,Optical Digital Audio Cables-3 foot,"These cables were so much cheaper than the ones that you would purchase at Best Buy, Radio Shack, etc., that I was a little suspicious about their quality, and whether or not they would actually work. When I received them and hooked them up, though, I was very pleased. Delivery time was also good."
1,Spend a little more money and save your devices,"I broadly figured all optical cables were born equal. Not so. On unwrapping and inserting the cable to my system the protective covering broke off inside my device. Not only is the cable worthless (zero sound), the device I plugged it into is also useless, as it has the ring of cover of the fiber optic suck in it, such that no other cables can be plugged in. Learn from my mistake, spend a little more and get a better cable."
1,Misleading Pictures,"The picture posted by another reviewer is what this cable actually looks like. And truthfully, in my opinion, that picture has a higher quality look about it than the actual cable. The other pictures show a much thicker cable that gives the appearance of good quality. I recognize that you get what you pay for and one shouldn't expect high quality at the price quoted. Nevertheless, the highly misleading pictures should be completely unacceptable. The cable that I received was of such poor quality that I just trashed it. I wouldn't consider using it in my home theater setup."
5,Optical cable,I used this to transfer the optic signal from a PS3 to a switch. It works fine and the quality is good.
5,It works,I have a crazy mixture of legacy and modern technology that makes up my entertainment center. I used this for my sony google tv box.
3,"Functional, but not for Yamaha",I purchased two of these. The cable worked fine and plugged into my 360 and Dish network boxes perfectly. Oddly they would not lock into my Yamaha sound bar. They functioned just fine as long as I didn't pull on the cables. The Yamaha cable plugged into everything fine.
5,No problems here,"While these connectors do not have the thick insulation or sturdy feel of a Monster or NXG cable, they are certainly worth the price. Both cables I bought fasten as securely as the more expensive toslink cables I own, function just as well, and arrived just as shown in the photo, with dust caps."
3,Worth every penny,"No protectors like shown in the picture for the connectors.Certainly not as thick. (My headphone's have thicker cables).Connections aren't as high quality as shown in picture either.Haven't tried the quality, yet. I don't have high expectations. But it was only $.02"
1,Waste of money!,I bought 2 optical cables and neither worked. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. It would have cost me more to return it than what the cables sold for. Maybe the company knows this!
2,They suck.,"I bought these cables because they were cheap, and now I see why. They, quite simply, suck. I tried paring them with an optical splitter, to allow me to plug in my optical headphones into both my Xbox 360 and PS3 at the same time, but they completely bug out. It seems to me that the heads barley even touch the inside components, but with much poking and prodding, they work for the Xbox 360 ONLY if it is in a perfect spot on the output, and any movement sends my headphones into a static filled frenzy. It doesn't work at all for the PS3. I've tried every possible combination of the three cables I bought to try and get it to work, and they simply do not. My recommendation? Buy something more expensive."
1,Poor customer service.,"I'm still waiting for this cable. After some unsuccesful attempts at contact, was told it on on backorder. No anticipated ship date given."
3,Not needed after all,"Never got a chance to evaluate, found I did't need after all. But was received in a timley manner and just as advertised. Very satisfied with everything pertaining to order shipment and response from Amazon."
1,Ordered wrong cable,No opinion. I could not tell from the product description that it was not what I needed. The item was very cheap so I discarded it.
1,Digital Audio Optical TOSLink Cable Optic 3ft,"These cables are very thin. Two of the tips broke off in side my units optical receptacle. They broke when I removed them. Very flimsy construction. I do not recommend using these in quality units. I threw them away.3 FT Digital Audio Optical TOSLink Cable Optic 3ftSold by: Cmple.com, Inc"
4,TOSLink Optical Audio Cable,"Arrived on time and as advertised. Pesumably better audio for digital media than RCA plugs, although I couldn't hear any difference."
5,Worked as Expected,"Good product, great price. Bought it over a year ago and it's still in service. Having the fiber optic cable greatly improves the capabilities and flexibility of my home theater. Very satisfied with this purchase."
2,Doesn't Match Photo?,"Just got this cable this morning and I must say I'm a little disappointed. I was expecting a thicker jacket on the cable based on the photo, which it doesn't match at all.This cable measures 1/32in diameter and I was expecting at least an 1/8in or 1/4in cable. The packaging states 2.2mm, SKU 378, RoHS Compliant. Maybe I missed this in the description?Oh well. It was cheap, and it probably works, and it's not like I'll get interference on an optical cable, but don't buy based on the photo."
3,Sleek and practical with some flaws,"I have tried on countless pairs of Mary Janes. These are great in appearance - quite sleek. As for flaws I think they run small and are especially narrow. I had to exchange for a larger size, and they are still kind of tight. I think it's the width that is the problem. I have to wear really thin socks with them or tights. I also scuffed one shoe the first time I wore it. A little piece of black material tore off and underneath it is almost white. I tried to cover it up as best I could, but this is a quality problem."
5,Couldn't be more pleased!,"The Three R's was an insightful read. It broke down primary ed into bite size pieces. After reading this book, I had full confidence in my ability to write up my own homeschool program. Although we use Oak Meadow curriclum, I use many ideas from Ruth Beechick. My daughter also loves counting with the number chart included in this book!"
1,Not enough here - disappointing.,"These booklets are short and somewhat rambling atttempts at beginning a cirriculum. No way they provide enough for the homeschooler. Look to more complete books like E.D. Hirsch, and the Writer's Express series. Even ""workbooks"" are better than these."
5,Great Resource...and Filled With Wisdom,"The great thing about these little (28-30 pages) guides is that they truly give you all you need to start successfully homeschooling your K-3rd Grader in 3 core areas: reading, Language (Grammar) and Math. They are jammed packed with details and wonderful ""how-tos"", not rhetoric. I imagine that you can design a whole year's curriculum with just this packet, and a collection of very good books. Do yourself a favor, ditch the urge to buy those expensive curriculums with bells and whistles. Buy this first. I just wish I found this series BEFORE I spent hundreds of dollars on buying and selling things I didn't want or need. When you have finished this, I suggest you read Beechick's You Can Teach Your Child Successfully for more wisdom on schooling 4th-8th Grade.Enjoy."
5,Superb Starters,"These are the best little books for starting to homeschool. They cover the basics and they do it well. With just these three books, a few math manipulatives, and a selection of books for reading you too can homeschool. These books cover everything you need for the basics. They provide me the confidence I need and a reminder to keep it simple. I wish I had found these books first before reading any of the other 'how to homeschool' type books or wasting my time trying to find a prepackaged curriculum.Enjoy."
5,"Reading, Writing and Arithmetic","This could easily be my whole curriculum for reading, writing and arithmetic. Great and easy to follow and understand. Ruth Beechick is thorough in her knowledge and as a homeschool mom I appreciate the help."
5,Fundamental Homeschooling Book,This is one of the fundamental homeschooling books -- useful for parents of children up to about age 8.
3,Admirable But Hard To Follow,"This was the first time I sat through a lengthy silent film drama. This may be a salvaged silent film, but it seemed that parts were missing which is ironic because it is very lengthy! Printed dialogue seemed to skip silent actors implied script which made the storyline seem disjointed. Interesting and enjoyable if one focuses on the actors and their silent craft. But the seemingly lack of storyline continuity and overall film length make this very tedious to sit through to the end. However, being as I am certainly not very knowledgeable concerning silent film stories, perhaps this is typical."
4,"Captivating, Inventive, and Just a Bit Evil","If the first five minutes of this film don't grab you then you probably don't like cinema. From the opening frames of Pete's newspaper delivery truck to ""Evil Donald"" and the local Keystone Cops, you cannot help but laugh out loud.The DVD is labeled full screen, but it is letterboxed on screen. HOWEVER it appears it was not mastered from the film but from the laserdisc master, like the upcoming ""original"" Star Wars DVD people are complaining about. It just does not seem to have full DVD resolution. The colors are vibrant however, and the film deserves to be seen, even if ""on laserdisc."" At least you don't have to flip the disc over!"
2,blah,"Student, I do not like this book. I feel like I am reading a dictionary, which is long and boring. Would prefer if author cut out the definition to term, histories, fact and stick it at the end of the book instead."
2,Not an easy read,"This books is a tough read, Mr. Tanenbaums explanations of concepts is very loopy and confusing at best. I have a fairly strong foundation in Operating Systems but still this book leaves me dazed. In addition to this book I have Operating Systems by Deitel and Stallings and I find that they manage to convey the concepts of OS much more clearly than Mr. Tanenbaum. I would strongly recommend against this book, even keeping it as a reference is a no-go especially considering the cost."
4,Comprehensive Text,"This is a real comprehensive text, although not appropriate for beginners, is the most comfortable book for those who have some background. The exercises do deserve a mention here as they are real brain teasers."
2,An ok book but sloppy in places,"Tanenbaum's book has several errors that really give the impression he is not a clear thinker. For example, in the edition I read (1993), the monitors implementation in C was completely wrong, and he thinks that you can deadlock if a printer manager errantly loses a lock (indeed no, under precise definitions, there is no circular wait). In my brief encounter with this book I ran across two conceptual errors. I wonder how many total errors are in this book?"
3,"Fine for it's time. Simplistic, subjective.","There's plenty of humor and opinion mixed in with the text, which is fine if you're into that.While reading this text I've ran into a few topics like scheduling and context switching that were explained much more clearly in comparable texts by Silberschatz, et al."
2,Poorly structured and written,"I am a computer science student and I LOVE operating systems material, but unfortunately I had to learn it from this horrible text book.Pros:1. Touches a lot of topics2. Nice humorCons:1. Long and unclear paragraphs with no easy to read structure. Many times those paragraphs doesn't make sense and the ""bottom line"" from all these is a mystery.2. Many core concepts do not have clear explanations. Instead there are just long and unclear paragraphs of texts with no clear explanation once so ever.3. Crude and Meaning less drawings, the book looks like one big chunk of text, it seems that the author was just to lazy to add some more descriptive illustrations where he needed to. For example: he explains about hard drive structure and cylinders and tracks, and there isn't a single illustration that shows what a cylinder is.Conclusion:Covers a lot of topics, but as a text book or a technical book it fails to clearly convey core concepts. Wouldn't recommend."
2,Riddled with mistakes,"I taught an operating systems course at a top-30 north american university using ""Operating Systems Concepts"", 5th edition. At the same time, i looked at Tanenbaum's book ""Modern Operating Systems"" to get ideas for problems. Instead of just copying his homework assignments, i actually read the book and created homeworks from scratch using the figures and examples in this book.I got burned twice. IMHO, the book is loaded with logic errors. Not only were the programming examples wrong, but the logical concepts (e.g. examples of what constitutes deadlock) were also wrong. If i found this many errors by looking at just two chapters, you know there are hundreds more buried elsewhere in the book.Don't screw up your students' minds with this book. Hardly worth the paper its printed upon."
1,YIKES!,"This is just scary! Disco combined with Eartha growls? Not a great idea, if you ask me. While I do love Miss Kitt, this one only got one turn in the CD player...."
1,The best of eartha kitt: where is my man?,"I'm sure the Eartha Kitt cd would have been fabulous but what I got instead in the Eartha Kitt cd case was Dreamgirls originial cast soundtrack ... The old switcheroo! They did refund my money and I was told to keep the Dreamgirls cd for my trouble. What irritates me is that they advertised the Eartha Kitt cd so shouldn't they have had checks and balances to make sure that they actually HAVE it in stock. And yes, I could try again with another seller but who's to say that a rare item like the Eartha Kitt cd would actually be available or would it be the same bait and switch. They did what they could to correct the problem, but I still feel jipped."
2,Slingo pc game,I purchased this game on the recommendation of the previous reviews. I feel it's more of a childrens game & don't recommend it for serious adult game players.
4,Just wish they had the lyrics printed in the jacket,"Love this cd -- it's lots of fun to listen to, the music is enjoyable for both children and adults. It touches on a variety of cultures and styles, and the rhythms and lyrics are fun. My only complaint is that the words can be hard to understand, and the lyrics aren't in the cd book/jacket thing. I'd like to sing along with it, and teach my son, but I can't understand the words sometime!"
4,Great old tunes!,"Makes me pleased that I sang to my daughter so often as now she can relate to these old folk songs and sing along with my grandson. I think this is the one that has ""She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes..."" and little Zak gets such a kick out of ""Whoa back,"" ""Toot Toot"" etc. Wonderful exposure for a little one!"
4,A Child's Celebration of Folk Music/Various Artists,"Loved it except for the ""Ain't no bugs on me"" song. It uses the phrase ""how in the (hell) can the old folks tell"" In my opinion, that is not appropriate for young children."
2,Concerned mother actually listened to lyrics,"Most of the songs are enjoyable and of the caliber I expected after reading the reviews posted. However, on Garcia's version of ""Ain't No Flies On Me"", there is a mild obscenity, which is fine for an adult compilation, but unacceptable for a compilation directed to children. As the rules for this forum prohibit obscenities, I cannot be more explicit about the exact lyrics. I am extremely disappointed in the editors and will be returning my CD."
1,Heretic in to House!,It is always heartwarming to see good being traded for evil.This blasphemer is miles away fom makeing a tenous arguement.These are the final days folks!
3,Moderate,"I bought the entire Dr. Ci Labo: Basic Black skincare line and am moderately pleased with it. As for the moisture gel, I find it to be adequate at best. I feel I could spend a lot less money and be just as adequately pleased with a drug store moisturizer. The texture and scent are nice, but as someone with oily skin I still find it to be too moisturizing. I use a very tiny amount each day and still feel as though I have to towel off the excess. Maybe I will be happier with it during the winter months when my skin dries out a bit. Overall I would say that for the money, it's not necessarily worth it. Try cheaper products first; you might be pleasantly surprised."
5,A Rosetta Stone for this piece of history,"This book is one of the most comprehensive, balanced, objective pieces of literature I have ever read on any piece of history in my entire life. It is a shame that this book has not been more on the forefront for must reads on this piece of history. As a history buff on this topic and Middle Eastern history, it can often become frustrating to read any book on the subject due to the obvious partiality. Despite its lengty nature, 600 packed pgs, I feel reinvigorated. I highly recommend this and consider this a first stop must-read on this segment of history."
3,This could have been a REAL Greatest Hits CD,"I never could understand why Travolta didn't become a huge singing star.I loved his voice,and he had HUGE hits from ""Grease""and his first single,""Let Her In.""This CD has all of his main hits,and some songs I never heard before."
1,One Star For Sheer Belly-Splitting Laughter,"To hear Travolta ""sing"" the timeless classic, ""It Had to Be You"" is to toil in pain.It's THAT awful."
2,IS THIS REALLY DISCO?,"I own several Best Of from Disco Classics but I'm not sure this is really disco. Let Her In is OK, but I don't think of it as disco. It sounds like generic pop to me."
3,Title a bit misleading,"I use this book sometimes and I like it, but I have just a few problems with it. I got this book because it was titled ""Everyday Life in..."" and that's what I expected to find. A 'snapshot' of everyday life. Despite its title, at least 1/3 of the book is more about the westward expansion and American Indian culture in general, which is available in greater detail from numerous other books and web sites. For an overview of western history and culture, this book is fine. But for ""everyday life,"" a far superior book on the same topic is ""Seeking Pleasure in the Old West"" by David Dary."
1,Not much help,"I recently purchased this book and was sorely disapointed. A better title might be ""A GUIDE TO EVERYDAY LIFE IN THE WILD WEST FOR PEOPLE WHO NEVER HEARD OF THE WILD WEST"". Anyone who feels even remotely qualified to write anything about the west already has more information on hand than this book has to offer."
4,Accurate and entertaining,"Vedela Vida's book is funny at times, and always rings true.I have only participated in one of the rituals that she desribes, but she is totally accurate in her portrayal.In addition, she does not pass judgement on any of her subjects.She tells a story, good and bad, of why young women enter into the communities they do. I only give it 4 stars because the epilogue, though interesting, seems to be misplaced."
3,Vendela Vida is your tour guide through the foreign land of feminine rituals and traditions,"Less about social science and more about the author herself, this book was nonetheless an interesting read. It was somewhat akin to reading a tourist's travel-journal in which the writer is a newcomer in a foreign location, sharing with fresh (but often culturally biased) eyes the strange new world around her. Still, Vendela Vida is not a bad tour guide at all, she's very thorough in her observations, and gives the reader a glimpse into cultural rituals and traditions one may never otherwise have access to."
4,funny *and* educational,"I love a good read about womanhood in America, and I got this one off the discount rack at (a local store). I read it to my friend on a road trip, and we both found it incredibly interesting. Unlike some feminist-oriented books, there was little that a man could take offense at - and in fact, my male driving partner enjoyed it. We both still make reference to lines from this book.The most amusing chapter was on sororities. The author was actually able to infiltrate the greek system and experience rush the way a first-year would. As my college had no greeks, I was both amused and horrified at the rush system. The chapters on debutantes and quinceaneros were more academic in nature, because she couldn't participate undercover. Another great chapter covered girl gangs. As I've always seen a similarity between girl gangs and sororities, I loved contrasting the two chapters.This book spawned many interesting discussions with my co-reader, and I recommend it to reading groups."
5,"Insighful, witty, and actually fun to read...",I found the book to strike a nice balance into analytic insight and narrative. It had great moments of humor but this was never forced but a nice natural outgrowth of the talented writer. I strongly recommend it...
4,"A cute, quick, witty read","I really enjoyed this book, especially the part about weddings in Las Vegas. The author didn't attempt to make deep comments on the acts of these young women; she just provided the stories and let you think what you want.This is a book to read again when you need a pick-me-up (especially the sorority section!)."
4,"Insightful, playful and smart.","In the same playful and engaging manner that Joan Didion in ""Slouching Towards Bethlehem"" gathered essays about California in the late Sixties, Vendela Vida serves as a wonderful guide into the theme of transition. Her voice is personable. By the end of the book, she was like a friend who I enjoyed hearing stories from, and to whom I would look for new perspectives and insights on some of life's biggest challenges. I look forward to hearing more from this young writer soon."
1,Review of Draping for FD LATEST EDITION by Jaffe and Relis,"I was excited for the release of this book as I was hoping that it would clarify the parts of the earlier edition, released SEVEN years ago. Unfortunately the only things the authors have done is add in a chapter on children's apparel and clarify about three pictures. Besides that they use the same pics, the same words, the same descriptions. What a disappointment. They may as well have just released a separate book on children's apparel instead of pretending that they updated their earlier edition. Seven years and no improvements on the bulk of the text. Why bother? Super disappointed."
3,Book review,"The book came before the actual day that it was delivered, but I was disappointed in the book itself not the seller. That is why I rated it three stars and not five."
4,Draping for Fashion Design,Very Helpful! Helped me take my designing to another level...I moved from drafting to draping.
4,Simple and straightforward,Simple and straightforward approach to draping. Good supplemental tool and handy resource book for students of pattern making and design.
2,Didn't find much use for it,The information doesn't go beyond the basics. The illustrations were just so-so. I had for a few years and rarely referenced it. Ended up trading it back in.
2,Internet Worm History,"This book is compiled as a reaction on the Internet Worm beginning of the 90ties). It leaves you untouched, unless you have a historical interest in what happened and how the worm was found, traced, dissected, etc.It is not worthless, but I wouldn't buy it today."
5,Great CD,"I received this CD as a gift when my son was born. He is now almost 4 yrs. old. He and my daughter (8 mos.) love this CD. It is very relaxing ,has wonderful music, and we will continue to listen to this CD for years to come."
5,Who Needs a Baby to Enjoy This Music?,"I've enjoyed this cd for several years now. If the day has been particularly stressful, I find it easy to unwind by listening to this beautiful and restful music. The selected lullabies reflect ethnic diversity beginning with the haunting ""Swedish Lullaby"" by Libiana, to the Spanish ""A La Nanita Nana"" by Tish Hinojosa, to the African ""Be Still My Child"" by Ladysmith Black Mambazo. It's comforting to realize that in every culture in our too aggressive, troubled world, caring parents soothe their children to sleep with beautiful music. All of these songs are found on individual albums but are seamlessly brought together in this thoughtful compilation. There are a lot of lullaby cds to choose from, but this one will entertain adults as well as babies. I recently ordered it again to include in a baby shower gift. Exhausted new parents need rest too!"
4,Good,My favorites are the spanish lullaby and the african lullaby. You would have to appreciate listening to the lullabies of different countries to like this.
2,misleading purchase,"after listening to the samples from the cd, i thought it would be a great purchase for some variety during sleepy-time. however, it is only 4 songs for the mp3. need to clarify better. mp3's should always be cheaper than the cd, but there needs to be a better description about the digital product."
5,I can never tire of these lullabies!,"Someone gifted us with this CD when my first son was born 13 years ago. We listened to it each night, with each song sounding better than the next. Though my children are growing, and we no longer to ""need"" lullabies, we still play this wonderful music on a regular basis. So soothing! I have gifted many families of newborns with this amazing CD and will continue to do so without regret. Everyone I know that has it, loves it. You will too!"
5,This CD is great,I bought this CD for my newborn. He is now 3 months old and he listens to this in the morning while he's in his swing. It puts him right to sleep (and then I can take a shower!) The songs are so beautiful. This is a great CD for anyone's collection.
5,Taught me some new lullabys to sing to my baby,"I bought this CD after listening to the excerpts on Amazon and it quickly became our favorite.One of the first tracks is a swedish song with no words (just ""dye dye la looo"" that sort of thing) that I like singing to my baby. There is another Oriental song of the same sort in the middle that I really like also.The last track is a Bobby McFerrin that is just gorgeous. I discovered recently that when my husband puts our baby to bed he plays it the last thing before he lays her down, and he'd be embarassed to know I was telling the world that sitting in the dark with his baby cuddling up to his chest, rocking her in the chair with that song playing nearly always makes him tear up a little. It is such a sweet song.I'm buying this for my niece for Christmas."
5,Perfect for babe and parents too,"I first heard this beautiful CD years ago when I stayed with a friend's child over the weekend as they travelled. He was a toddler and he could not go to sleep without it. I don't have kids, but as soon as I got home, I ordered a copy for myself! I continue to listen to it regularly and have given it as a new baby gift to many new parents ever since. Enjoy!"
4,"Love the first half, like the second","We all have different taste in music, but for me the first half of this CD is the loveliest. The music is a bit faster and louder toward the end, which doesn't make sense to me since this is when your baby will be (hopefully!) sleeping. The Golden Cradle song has become our favorite (song 2)."
3,Wakes her up!,"This cd does have some pretty songs on it, but the transition between the songs is sort of jolting. As soon as the first song ends and my daughter is just about to drift off, the second song comes on and wakes her up again! The same goes for the fourth song. She does sleep through the rest of it eventually, but I'm looking for a new cd."
2,Not as soothing as I had hoped.,"This collection is kind of a hit-and-miss. Some of these songs are beautiful. I find myself gazing in the crib at my sleeping baby, and a peacefulness comes over me. These are the songs that capture the beauty of this time in my baby's life.However, some of the songs are not soothing. I also agree that one song is a bit louder than the others. It customarily causes him to stir and/or wake up.For the most part, we listen to this for a little variety. But, I would suggest, ""I Can Only Imagine."" It is a fantastic collection of soothing songs just perfect for bedtime and relaxation.Enjoy sharing music with your babies!"
4,Soothing,"I love this CD. I am surprised that there are no reviews for this album. It has lullabies from all around the world, including ones from Spain, Africa, Canada, Ireland, the South Pacific, Japan, and Sweden. I always use it to help me get to sleep at night."
2,Lullaby: A Collection-Various Artists,I was disappointed in this one because of the different styles and the ethnic music. I was expecting something more traditonal for babies. It just was not what I was hoping for
1,A new age CD NOT a lullaby collection,"This CD maybe good for new age lovers but not for my baby. I would rather recommend ""Rock-A-Bye collection""."
2,A bit of a let down,Not as good as the previous two in the series. The reader gets the distinct feeling that the author merely wished to finish the series and therefore huried towards the end.
2,"""Professional Smithing""",I found the book covered some useful tools & techniques but also many largely obsolete hardware items which perhaps would be of little value today. For example projects on two sets of pipe tongs and a significant part of the book is devoted to latch & lock work. Some of the designs for a professional book are very simplistic for example the fire place crane.
3,Not my favorite,"I ordered this with high hopes based on the other review. In fact I ordered a second one as a Christmas gift. Well, after looking through mine, I sent the other one back and got a different book. This one is just OK, but you can do a lot better with your money on books of this subject."
1,Does not feed material! Jams on everything.,"This is a gravity feed spreader. Since the drum is flat on the bottom, there is just a 4"" hole. While this seems large, due to the lack of a ""funnel"" into the hole, the side pressure of the material at the bottom causes the hole feed to bind. If the material isn't ""PERFECT"" then it cloggs and does not FEED AT ALL. If it does feed it comes out so fast that you go through 300 lbs of material in about 5 minutes, and you can't drive fast enough to make it work. Plus the motor is so weak that you have to get out of your truck and spin it to get it started. I paid $500 with Northern on this and because I got it in the fall, prepped for winter, when the snow came and I found all about this terrible equipment, Northern would not exhange, refund or make it right. A complete RIP OFF!"
5,"The Best Dance,Music Artist Never Heard!!","I heard,this Record,for the first time,when i was only,about 3 yrs old!!,and i really liked it!!,it's a must!! Info on cd:Free style,house,dance music Artist from the 70's,Excellent stuff,it's a must!!"
4,DANCIN' FOOL,"Amii's back for more! 'though her selection seems beneath her obvious talents as a vocalist, she gives it all she's got in these pleasant dance renditions of familiar tunes. Yes, at times she sounds like she is singing from inside an aquarium - in fact, she may be!"
5,Theatre World Volume 60 2003-2004,"Love the book. I'm very happy that Amazon had the book for sale. I usedto be able to purchase the book at the in NYC but the book store closed.I'm looking forward to Volume 61. The book lists all shows that opened in NYC for the season, with all casts, directors, awards. Also lists off broadway, off off broadway, regional productions. So if theatre is your love this series is for you. Thanks."
2,Where are labels to put on the tabs?,"These are exactly the type of dividers with tabs that I needed. I realize that these dividers are supposed to go through an off-set printer for the tab portion. However, we want to print up our own labels for the tabs. I can't believe Avery has no self-adhesive laser printable label that will fit these tabs. But I called Avery and they said NO. Going to look for them elsewhere."
3,Very good. But way too dragging,"This is a very good movie. They have good plot and romance. There's just one major drawback. It kept dragging way too much. They could have definitely cut some scenes. If you like KDrama OST, the OST is awesome."
1,Bad Review - No Drafting PICTURES!,This book lacks one important thing that is vitally important to drafting - namely PICTURES! There are no pictures in this book. The reason I know this is that I found the book online FREE (Download PDF) (HINT...HINT) with PICTURES!
1,Illustrations Deleted!!!,"I ran across a chapter of this book on the internet. The text was well written and the illustrations were very well drawn. To be honest, I decided to purchase this book mainly for the illustrations. When it arrived, there was not a single illustration. I mean, I am not the type of person who requires illustrations in my novels, but this is a book on mechanical DRAWING. The book even indiactes where an illustration should be located. In all there were some 330 illustrations removed, I guess to save paper. The savings were not passed on to me though - I payed $30 for this paperback (120 pages total). If you wish to purchase this book, be very sure that the illustrations have not been removed."
5,Like No Other!,"This CD is like no other. He is the best. The production, the vocals, the songs, I love this album. Forgive/Forget is my favorite. This album takes you through a love story from start to finish. This is the best R&B, most consistent with hits, album I have heard in a long time. No one can touch Marcus Vance. I can't wait for the videos. I must have!!!!!"
5,Will you marry me?,"This album is da bomb! My favorite song is ""Forgive & Forget""; it reminds me of when my boyfriend cheated on me and I found out. ""Freakin It"" is hot, and ""Good Man"" is too. Plus, he is sooooo fine! R Kelly look out; I am in love with Markus!"
5,Magickal music,"This album is really cool....i cannot think of any way to concretely categorise it. I would especially reccomend it to people who like ""world music"", Middle Eastern or Native American stuff.....it is like mixing Dead can Dance with the Vocals of Tori Amos and Siouxie and The Banshees....like i said i am unable to categorise here, i am inept! They are awesome though! I have seen them four years in a row (except this year) at the Eugene W.O.W. Halls witches ball, this year i missed them because my ride was late! Let me just put it this way, my night was definately not as good as it could have been after that! They are so creative, great dancing/trancing music.......by missing them my whole night was ruined.If you like this, you should try Tchkung too which has some of the same Tribal flair, but is more on the political chaotic side of this....i still think they should have played together!"
2,Not too deep,"This book was an easy read, and to me, the author does not focus enough on her emotional struggles leaving her children behind in Iran. She goes into so much detail about so many other things in her life, that I never really got a feel for how her heart felt leaving her children with her abusive husband in Iran. She focused too much detail on all the characters that she met when she left Iran and was living in Israel.I never felt any sympathy/empathy for her as a mother, she just drifted around so much, and seemd like she never tried hard enough to get her life in order and get her kid back.She does not go into great detail about her life in Iran, or the abuse she suffered. This book is more like a tale of her adventures as a single woman in Israel. I would not recommend this book, there are many other books that are much more facinating, such as the Pianist."
3,Things This Colorado Native Never Knew,"This book has some interesting facts, but could have had more depth to it - there is so much about Colorado that I know that is not common knowledge."
2,NASA is in trouble,"If Mr. Bizon's work is truly an example of what is the best that NASA can offer, than the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is in big trouble. I am rather surprised that Mr. O'Keefe debases himself with such a overexuberant review of Mr. Bizon's work. The report itself is a standard technical report written by a mostly competent digital design engineer. It is dry and unexciting, albeit somewhat informative. One can tell that it was written by an engineer rather than a professional writer."
5,Amazing!,"32 absolutely top-notch electro-industrial songs, including brand new artists and rare/exclusive songs by established artists, for only TEN BUCKS?!?!?! ANY fan of electronic music or anyone looking for something new would be crazy not to get this great compilation!"
1,Wrong item,"They sent us the wrong dvd and I emailed them, but haven't gotten the envelope they promised to return the wrong dvd and, hopefully get reimbursed or sent the correct one."
4,excellent band,"these guys really rock the guitars and vocals are very unique this collection here includes most thier good stuff. have you ever wondered why most of the best metal bands come from british background? like def leppard, ozzy osbourne, manowar, triumph, iron maiden ect. just something to think about, but if you like the other bands listed here you should definately like triumph."
4,"Not bad, but could've been better.","This greatest hits album is not bad. I just wish they wouldn't have included ""Rocky Mountain Way"" or ""Love Hurts."" These are both cover tunes. Though they are not bad, they don't belong on a greatest hits album. To me, a greatest hits collection should be original songs by the artist themselves, not songs by other bands, such as Joe Walsh and Nazareth. I'm glad this collection includes ""Blinding Light Show."" I wouldn't have bought it if it didn't. In my opinion, the collection would've have been complete if it included ""Rock & Roll Machine."" Oh well, I guess you can't have everything. This album should've been released by another company, either from Canada or the United States."
1,Don't buy this book !,"This is a horrible book! It basically lists every bad behavior a child can exhibit and says it's okay because the child is just trying to be himself. ""Let me try it my way and we'll get along fine!""""but I've got to show that I'm me, me, ME!"" I hope this book is no longer in print and that it stays that way."
1,Oh my...,"I don't own this, but if the cover is any indication, the Chinese characters will be completely mangled and wrong. I don't recommend attempting to show off to your Chinese friends using anything you make from the book, if you really intend to get it. Also, it'd probably be a bad idea to get an ""exotic"" Chinese character tattoo using one of the designs as basis."
2,not worth the listed price,"I was dispointed with this product because I expecting more for what I paid for. When it was all and said and done. I paid like 8-9 dollars for seven cheaply made - chinese stencils. They served their purpose , but should have been a lot cheaper because of lack of quality."
2,Fun with Chinese Symbols Stencils,Dissatisfied only because I waited weeks. I needed it was weddings display. It came after the date expected. So it was too late.
2,What's up with the freaky eyes?!,"I love Bratz and have collected a lot of them and I wanted Wild Wild West Dana when I first saw pictures of her. However, I recently saw her in a store and was shocked by her eyes! They're absolutely dreadful! The lines in her irises (the colored parts of her eyes) are way too dark and make it look like she's been hypnotized or that she's in a trance. The person at MGA who approved this doll's face should be fired because I doubt anyone will find her eyes attractive! I saw Wild Wild West Fianna and Yasmin and they both have regular Bratz eyes so I wonder why they gave Dana such weird eyes? This is the first time I've given a Bratz doll a bad review but Dana's eyes just ruin her whole look. The rest of the doll looks fine and I love the clothes, but now I doubt I will be buying Dana because I just can't get past her eyes."
3,bratz don't remain a mystery n'more!,"Okay guys [...] The new Bratz comming out are:Felica - AA girlKiana - Native American girlTwiinz 2 - Tess and NonaKatia - russian girl - brunnetteTwiinz 3 - blonde - Orianna and ValentinaThe last girl DOES remain a mystery, tho![...]They're so great!Meggie"
2,fullem or whatev your name is .......................,"why do you spell everything with a 'Z' it isn't cool, it isn't ""cute"" (although you think it may be that) its stupid. get with it. dolls are for girls, females, FEMALES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and females alone. not guys.................. c"
1,Yuck! Don't waste every bit of your money!,"This doll is so yucky. Have you seen any other Bratz Wild Wild West stripping naked in the West! I wouldn't waste my money on a bratz girl who takes nearly all her kit off when she's going out in the West! The Yasmin and the Fianna are 15,000000000 times better than this doll. This doll is wearing soooooooooo little."
4,DON'T DISC BRATZ,"THAT IS FINE IF YOU DON'T LIKE BRATZ. BUT DON'T CALL THEM DUMB, CAUSE PEOPLE STILL LIKE THEM .STUPID*****"
4,"She's my favorite Bratz doll,She has a Barbie painted face","I am not a Bratz doll fan, I have always played with Barbie since I was 6 I am now 31,But I love these wild west dolls their hair is Beautiful,and fun to style and wash,I am going to get all these dolls,just because I like their clothes and LONG hair.I have over 500 Barbie dolls and they want some NEW friends called Wild Wiilld West Bratz.Lets play girls Barbie and Bratz are the best.."
1,umhm,"children, children, children, what's ya mama gonna say when you come back with this doll. she' a 2 dolla gesabele, look at da threads, there barely there! Get kiana, way better."
1,Oh no.The evil Bratz doll is here.TAKE COVER!!,"Sure.My sister(I am a boy...Shut up)Told me about one of the people calling this particular doll a-don't mind me-a hoe,i believe,having no idea what that meant,i looked.and screamed.my mother fainted and my tough cousin wet his pants.(his name is Marcus Neely JR.!!)so i don't recomend this doll.She is so ugly i thought the computer would blow.I would've recomended this doll a big 'ol ZERO but it won't let me.You have been warned by the boy of your dreams(joking lol)"
1,What?,"OK, that is NOT what a person wears going out west! Where's the rest of the outfit?!?! If someone is going to wear THAT, they may as well wear a piece of paper that says ""Rape Me"" on it!!!! WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMING TO!?!? It used to be important that a girl covers herself as much as she could, and now it's like the less she wears the better! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!? Mothers, I beg of you, if you TRULY love your children, DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!"
5,Very Special,"This is a very special book. Our new puppy chewed it up, but I was fortunate to find a replacement on Amazon. It is short, but filled with wonderful stuff. I'm keeping this copy far away from the puppy!"
3,Buyer Beware!!,"If your looking to replace some of your vintage 12"" singles with this collection as I was---BEWARE!! This disc was recorded from vinyl and possibly even a cassette source on a couple! The 12"" singles they did create this with weren't in very good shape, there are plenty of pops and clicks to prove it. If that wasn't enough, they didn't cut the bass down enough. That's a problem because 12"" singles from this time period were always pretty bass heavy to begin with. The best song on the whole CD is ""Keep In Touch (Body to Body)"". Which is the biggest audio mess of them all. Some of the recordings are decent, but it really jumps around in quality."
1,Will not work with Windows 7,I purchased the CD and when it arrived I tried to install it. I kept getting error messages when I ran setup on my Windows 7 computer so I tried it on my wife's laptop which has Windows XP and it loaded. At this point I noticed that there was sticker on the outside of the CD Case stating that you could call a toll free number to get the free Vista upgrade. I called the number and spoke with the customer rep. of manufacturer of the CD ROM. She seemed surprised that I did not have the latest version which works with Windows 7. Apparently Amazon sells the outdated version which does not work with Windows 7. So I had to send the CD back to the manufacturer at my own expense in order to get the newest version. Just a heads up if you are buying from Amazon so you do not go through the same thing I did.
3,Hammy is just OK,"Didnt love it as anticipated after reading the high reviews. It is slow and I can't sit through it, but Hammy is cute and my daughter watched the videos once or twice before giving them away."
1,Very disappointing,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie but saw that it won a lot of rewards. I'm not sure why. It was well filmed but totally confusing. How could 40 of the brightest minds not come up with a better idea than to boycott China? I didn't enjoy watching the participants argue. The best part of the movie was watching the Dalai Lama transform the group, but the group didn't seem to have much to offer the Dalai Lama. It really left me wondering what they intended."
5,Training the Ego,Volume one; The Dalai Lama Renaissance. This is the finest film that I have seen so far that reveals the unbounded ego in all of us. The evolution of the participants is stunning when they come forward with recognition of their own ego selves and their need to correct this if any one of us is to solve the problems of the world or at best our own. Volume 2 in this series gives a beautiful account of the individual participants and their goals for this conference. My continuous stream of consciousness was very positively affected by watching these 2 films. Beautifully and sensitively filmed and edited. These films are a triumph.
5,Subtle and moving,"This was an excellent doc on a ""glimpse"" into the world of the Dalai Lama, but more importantly, a glimpse into us all. With philosophers and scientists, and others exchanging viewpoints, the end result is much more simple, and much more impactful.I have to admit, 20 minutes or so into the film, I wasn't quite sure what the point was (was it just a bunch of intellectual-types arguing whose smarter, and who has the ""right"" view or solution?).But later in the film, and especially the conclusion, really made the point, and was well worth the journey. Through it all the ""middle way"" is the answer, with compassion, and with opening our hearts and minds. Thank you for this beautiful glimpse. I encourage all to view or buy this film!"
1,All in this together,"I can't really add much to the other one-star critiques but since I bought this DVD I'm going to vote. How embarrassing and half-baked for those great minds who travelled so far to accomplish so little other than excessive fawning over ""His Holiness."" I could just hear the Dalai after the fact muttering to his cadre, ""What the hell was that?"""
5,Excellent!,"This is a light, flavorsome tea. The tea leaves are top quality and the packaging innovative. If only everything I buy made me feel this good!"
2,It's tea...,"It's tea, but doesn't really rank that high on my list. The tea bags are nice and of high quality but the flavor is lacking and less than desirable. I have to add a lot of honey to this brand to get any kind of satisfaction. For the price it's not worth it either. There are better, tastier brands that cost less. I say if your a tea connoisseur try it you might like it more than I, but if your looking for a high quality, tasty brand without the trial and error I recommend Bentley's."
5,This is not science fiction! An extraordinary thinker...,"This is an incredible book that deserves much wider exposure. I have no idea why it is lost in the science fiction category.Denton is a delightful writer, engaging and personable as he conducts a ""conversation"" with his reader. He offers cogent explanations, piercing philosophy, and elegantly simple, carefully reasoned solutions to the most pressing problems of our times, as well as a shining template for living with clarity.While reading this book I was excited, humbled, challenged, exalted, and above all profoundly grateful to be holding the gift of David Denton's thoughts and ideas in my hands. He is undoubtedly one of the most extraordinary and overlooked thinkers of our day!"
2,First Time In My Life I Got Breakouts! Does not Help to Brighten Either.,"totally not worth the money i spent, not only did it not done too much brightening, it's greasiness gave my face breakouts which had never happened even with cheap drug store brands. i have very normal skin which can easily adjust to light or heavy lotions, but this one makes me scared. stay away if you are not a regular user!"
1,Eton ESP2000 AM/FM Atomic Clock Radio (Silver),I was expecting more. The radio tuning dial was faulty (right out of the box). The nature sounds are not of high quality. Shop around. I returned this item for refund.
5,Liners,If you have the Pelican then you need these also. Fit tight and clean up nice if you want to get some extra life out of them. Makes your Pelican bucket last a lot longer.
5,The Best Insights To Brain Architecture--A 'Must-Own' For Brain Researchers,"Recently, I have been reading several books on the brain--not just its cold, on-the-slab anatomy but its functional anatomy at the neuron column level. I read:""On Intelligence"" [Jeff Hawkins] which was excellent""The Creative Brain"" [Nancy Andreason]""Origins of Genius"" [Keith Simonton]among others.This one tiny volume, almost like a comic book at first glance because of the profusion of illustrations [one of these authors must be left handed], was the absolute most important resource on the structure and function of the brain. Other books I read and set aside. This one I keep around as a guide book to the brain. I would suggest this ""Introducing Mind and Brain"" book and ""On Intelligence"" as the only must buy."
4,It sets the mood,"I wasn't expecting too much form this CD actually, another compliation disc with some songs i knew and some i didn't...but i was wrong. I found that the selection and order of tunes transported me to a mood that was oh so yummy.I will be looking for the others in this series."
4,Great option for older computers,"The EIDEmax II is a little quirky in setting up depending on the motherboard and existing IDE controller, but once set up it works fantastic. Installed in 486 DX4/100 with Windows 95 very reliably and also installed one in a Pentium 3/550 with Windows 98, also very reliable. Wouldn't recommend for later boards since it is restricted to 16 bit addressing, it is an ISA card after all. If you have a PCI board, use the later 32 bit Promise Ultra cards."
4,Gitane goes on a spiritual quest with this album,"Track by track, this album feels very different from Demonix. Gitane has dedicated this album to soul seeking and memories of a fallen comrade. Ball of Love may bring back memories of her ritual fascination of S&M and B&D, but elsewhere the album finds Gitane looking for a messiah figure to follow and hold close.Good lyrics; Laid back listening; Not particularly dark or somber; A little too religious; Solid production quality;"
2,norelco arcitec 1090 shaver,This razor is probably my 20th Norelco. It is the poorest of them all outside of being a handsome thing. Itwill not give a close shave no matter how hard I press or what direction I move it. I don't like cleaning it after every use. The side burn trimmer is nearly useless (too short and poorly located). I used my old Norelco for my last shave and it still shaves much closer. The side burn trimmer on the old one is great. I clean it only when it is full of whiskers and it has worked well for three years. I am glad I didn't throw it away. I do like the charging system and the display on the 1090 but the cord should be coiled and stretchy. The cord is difficult to store.
2,Worst Norelco I've owned,"I've been a satisfied user of Norelco razors for years. But the arcitec is a major dissapointment in so many ways. It takes much longer to get a clean shave than its traditional models and cleaning it is a chore unless you have nothing better to do with your time. Furthermore, after using it for three months it continues to irritate my skin and burn for a minute or two after shaving. As far as I'm concerned, its an expensive gimmick. Back to my reliable 8000 series"
5,Trash! Basura! Lixo!,"This has been the second time I purchased a Philips Norelco shaving System. I didn't learn my lesson the first time that philips Norelco simply thinks that they can sell TRASH for over $100.00 The first shaving system I bought I had to returned it because simply it did not do what they try to make us believe it would do. The razor will not cut your stubble even after going over the same are for more that 10 times. It feels so uncomfortable and it leaves patches all over my face. Waste of time and money. Shame of Philips for putting overpriced trash in the market. Consumers, DO NOT throw your money away."
2,good looking arcitec,"I purchased a Norelco Arcitec recently. l already own a cheaper Norelco several years old. The arcitec is nice looking and appears very functional. It looked great, came in a neat container that protects it when travelling and shaved quieter than my other Norelco. What it did not do was give me a close shave!At first I thought I was mistaken but after four more shaves I returned to my older model to get a closer shave. I was very disappointed. It was definitely not worth the money."
2,Not sharp enough blades,I found the blades too dull and didn't cut close to the skin. I don't look well-groomed at all.
3,Not THAT Good,"This product is WAY too noisy compared to every other Norelco shaver that I have had. Also, even two months after starting to use this item, I still am getting the occasional ""pinching"" effect EVERY time I shave. Something else that I'm not used to with a Norelco. Seriously considering going back to my older model and using this as my travel version. Wonderfully light, and beautiful to look at, but........"
1,Stay away,"The worst Philips shaver I had in over 25 years. Cool, yes, but innefective.The trimmer is a joke.My old 9850XL was much better, I used to take 4-5 minutes to shave, now it takes me up to 9 minutes, plus I have to wash it after every shave. Battery life is too short, and if I want to charge it on the go, I have to take the stand or the case with me as you cannot power it directly.Design above usefullness, not for me!"
3,New vs Old,"I've been using a Norelco Model #l5810XL ""old"" for quite a while. I decided to find a newer product for a closer shave and easier cleaning. The 1090 ""new"" seemed to fit the application, so I purchased it. After using it I have found that it doesn't shave any closer than the old Norelco and believe it or not it is harder to handle. The plus side of the 1090 is that it is so easy to clean, just run the cutter heads under the faucet. I hope this review will help someone get a more accurate picture of this item and think hard before you you assume ""new"" is always better then ""old"". it just isn't always the case."
1,Norelco Arctic razor,"This has got to be the worst and highest priced razor Norelco ever made. After about two months, I gave up on it and purchased a new set of heads for my old Norelco which is faster, shaves closer,and conforms to my face better.Its cute but cute don't cut my beard and I hate to think of what a set of replacement heads will cost. Unfortunately I am outside of the 45 day return period but I think people have been ghaving trouble with that too...Save your money or buy one of the more conventional Norelco's"
2,Not the Ultimate,"I have used the Arcitec 1090 for about a year now and am fortunate in that I never threw out my old Norelco 5801XL. The first problem is the pop up trimmer, on the Arcitec it is useless. When I need one I always go to the 5801XL. The second problem is that sometimes I don't shave on weekends so Monday mornings with the Arcitec the job gets only half done and I have to finish up with the older model. I was going to buy new blades for the Arcitec but decided to spring for a Speed XL instead. Sorry Philips Norelco but for me your flagship model has hit an iceberg."
3,Whisker King,"I am somewhat disappointed in this product.I have had to replace this shaver two times. There front has a clear sticker that can chip, wear, and peel within a few months use, (it's best to remove the head when rinsing to help remedy this problem).I have also had a difficult time finding replacement blades.It sometimes leaves a stray hair or 2 on my neck and the edge of my mouth. No electric shaver compares to a traditional blade.It's best to remove the head of the shaver when using the trimmer.I use the charging stand instead of the cofin when traveling as the pod is too bulky for practical use. The shaver requires either the stand or the pod to charge.Looks cool, feels cool, not really cool! Definitely not worth the high cost of a sports car look with hybrid performance."
1,VERY EXPENSIVE AND SLOW,"I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND, AFTER READING ABOUT THIS NEW RAZOR. 1ST VERY EXPENSIVE 2ND TAKES FOREVER TO SHAVE AND 3RD NOT A VERY CLOSE SHAVE. NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE."
4,"Nice, but...","Product was nice, but had to return it (unopened) as I bought it for my boyfriend for christmas, but he can't use electric shavers :( so had to return it. Seller was understanding and gave me a quick refund. Though I did use a $25 amazon coupon that has not been credited back to me orre-instated and I'm not sure if the Seller is suppose to do that or Amazon. I'd like to have it back to use at a later date - so at this point I don't know who kept the $25, but I'm still waiting for someone to do the right thing & so I can use the coupon. Thanks."
2,Very pretty but not impressive.,"I bought it, tried it, returned it. Not because it is a bad shaver, but because it performs just like many other shavers that I've owned over the years, just ""eh"". I've tried about 5 different electric razors and always went back to blades and cream for a truly close shave that didn't leave a burn. I fell for the hype around this one and being a gadget fanatic I had to try it. It shaved just ok, but definetely not worth the hefty pricetag."
3,It's the perks you are paying for !,"This Norelco shaving system is just that, a system! That's what one pays for because the closeness of the razor is not near what the hand held manual razor can do. We have used this, face for hubby, legs for me, and bottom line is the shave is not as close.There are great perks here! The multi-purpose display is excellent, indicates how much time you have left before recharging and the time is plenty! The storage case and charging stand are neat features. But for the quick shave, you need to use it too long, going over and over! It sure looks good though! ...Rizzo"
4,"Great quality and performance, but pricey","The Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 is a quality product. Being able to just rinse the heads to clean it is a big advantage, and it gives a close, comfortable shave. Some reviewers have said it does not suit the crumpled features, the facial nooks and crannies, that some of us have. I really think they are not using it correctly. If you hold it perpendicular to the surface, press very lightly and allow the heads to do the work, they will search out the nookiest and cranniest folds in the most convoluted of faces.The Power Pod supplied with it is a great idea, allowing you to take it on trips without having to worry about recharging it, but it is a little too bulky for my taste. I prefer to travel very light, and I think I'll continue to pack a couple of disposable razors rather than this pod.For quality and performance, I give it 5 stars, but I deduct 1 because I am not convinced that it is significantly better that other, cheaper models."
2,"Good technology, poor results","I have a skin very sensible and bought that norelco believing that it would resolve my problems and give me good shaving. I was disapointed, the product has very good quality, but the results aren't what i expected. I waste about 5 minutes for shaving but my skin was very bad after that with large irritated areas. The necessity of pass the shaver many times was terrible for my skin. I tried sometimes like recomended by the manual, but notice no change nor improvement. I think that it would be a great shaver for those that don't have sensible skin, not my case. Besides that i don't think that the flexible heads helps a lot, in fact i get the impression that fixed head it would be better for closer shaving. The display indicating time remaining is great.It can be a great product for those who already use eletric shavers succesfully, but i don't think that should be your first norelco if you're thinking trying eletric shaver."
3,Not so hot!!,"I've owned Norelco razors for 40 years and this razor was a complete disapointment...It's noisey, has no trimmer that can be used, has to be charged in its holder which means you can't use the cord directly and the performance of the shaver is questionable....all this for $200. What happened?"
4,Nice Shaver if found at nice price,Amazon has weired policy of not matching their own lower price in 30 days or so. So I had bought one few months ago which I returned because amazon would not give me refund when they dropped price within 2 days of my order.This time I bought on amazon because it showed up in lightening deals. Would not have bought otherwiseI have been using Norelco for few years now and this replaces my other Norelco whose batteries have died in about 7 years of usage (and replacement cost is more than product residual value.)I have this shaver for 3 weeks now.Pros: Nice shaver. Works great (better than my previous 8870XL or something). Shave is very clean and close.Cons: Carry / charge case is bulkier than previous models. Smaller hair chamber than previous models. Cost. 200+ $$ is ridiculous for item like shaver.
2,Very disappointing,I too was lured by the innovative look of this razor and have been a Norelco shaver fan for 20+ years. My problem with this razor is that it gives a lousy shave. Misses lots of areas and will not pick them up even when I went over them time and time again. I even went so far as to replace the head in hopes it was just a dud. Not so... Glad it works for some of you. A wasted $200 for me. I went back to my old one...
2,"agree with: looks great,bad shave","looks really cool but unfortunately very poor shape. keeps minimal amount of hair before it asks oyu to wash, which means that you will need to empty 2-3 times for one good shave! do not recommend unless you have very little facial hair and shave 1-2 times a day"
2,disapointed,i purchased this razor thinking it would shave better than my old norelco but i was disappointed. i got a better shave with my old norelco. i don't like this razor.
1,A disappointment,"I have used Norelco shavers for over 30 years. It is now a Philips Norelco and I have found it to be a great disappointment. Out of the box the shaves were impressive but using it over a six month period, my satisfaction with it evaporated. I recently ordered replacement blades for my previous Norelco model and have retired the Arcitec. The Arcitec blades seem to dull materially quicker then previous models. It does not work on cord and in my view does not travel well. The blades individually lift for cleaning and the stubble pit is too shallow. I have always owned top of the line Norelcos. Not sure they still exist,but if your choice is this or a more traditional Norelco...choose that."
3,Not worth the money,"For a razor costing over $200, this thing doesn't come close to what it should be able to do.My razor doesn't shave hairs past 2mm, and even the small hairs sometimes do not get shaved completely. I gave this razor to my friend and he had the same experience - it might shave 80% of tiny hairs on the first try if you dont sit there and rotate the thing for 5 minutes and use the back trimmer (which works better than the razor)NOTHING beats the $5 Gillette razor so far.IMO, not worth what I paid. Might be worth $80."
2,Loud and not that special,"I happened to have a pretty thick beard and they grow all different directions. I had an older version of Norelco and used it for quite some times and only changed the blades possibly once every two years and it still does a pretty good job. This shaver really is not worth the difference so in another words, you are not getting what you are paying for. It has a slik design and a very nice stand and that's about it. I would recomment sticking to a less pricey ones as that all seem to be the same and even a little less noisey :-)"
2,New product not as good as the old one,"Norelco Arcitec Razor - 1090XI have been using a Norelco Spectra 8894XL for many years and decided to ""upgrade"" to the new Arcitec with the modern design. Mistake!! It is not as good as the old one!"
5,philips norelco arcitec charger/ battery problems,"i have philips norelco arcitec for about 2-3yrs I recenty face problem which I can not it is with the battery or with the charger(typ8500x,input100-240vac,50/60hz,9w,output 15vdc,360 ma)battery sign was turned red even with input connected to acpower supply.with the help of local dealer using same typ of charger the battery turned to blue colour for some time. put it on battery sign turned to red colour with speed slowing down. pleas advice."
1,disappointed,"i was so looking forward to using this machine but when i got it ,it broke me out and the shave was not clean .i had to use it a few times to get it clean............"
3,"It's okay - maybe it's my face, maybe it's the razor","I've never had much luck with electric razors. They work, but it takes a lot of passes over my face and I keep on wondering if I am actually saving any time over using a razor.In this case - no.I have a beard and I don't have a lot of shaving needs - but I do need to trim my neck around the edges, especially on my neck. This shaver does on okay job, but this is a top of the line electric shaver and I expected more.On the positive side, it comes with a trimmer that is pretty nifty, it is extraordinarily easy to clean and is comfortable - both to the hand and to the face. The charger is easy to use and the unit tells you how many minutes and charge are left - a super-cool feature."
3,So so,"I've had this razor for a little over a year. I have medium beard growth at age 35. I shave almost every day. This razor is light, holds a good charge and adjust well to the shape of my face. On the other hand, it does not provide an exceptionally close shave; it will not pick up wiskers after three days of growth (I end up using the trimmer on the problem hairs, then shaving over them.); and it is a little bit of a pain to clean/maintain. Overall, I am not overly impressed with the razor, but I can't say that I have ever used one better either."
2,norelco shaver,"The shaver doesn't satisfy as far as shaving around the sideaburns, ears, and nose areas. Yes, it may be fine in the neck area, however that is a small part of a normal shave for me. I prefer the other style."
1,Very poor shaver,"I've used Norelco shavers all my life so I was hoping that this supposedly top of the line model would be better than previous models. I was SO VERY disappointed. The charge time on my previous model was well over 100 minutes. This one is 65 minutes fully charged. And the shave quality is very poor. I only have fine hair but even on my face, this shaver just doesn't do a good job. I am so frustrated with this shaver - it cost a lot of money and the shave is bad. I couldn't recommend it to anyone! And the travel case is junk. Nothing like the leather pouch I got with my previous shaver 6 years ago.Don't waste your money on this garbage!"
1,Can do everything but shave closely,"I bought this razor because I was sick and tired of those pesky hairs on the neck. Yes, it's a good looking razor and the concept seems brilliant; however, I fell victim to the bogus claims made in the commercials. Come to find out that my old $60 electric razor shaved much closer than this over-priced, gimmic of a shaver. It is extremely delicate, and in my opinion, the super-flexible head actually prevents a closer shave. Don't waste your money on this product!!"
2,Newer is not always Better.,"I've been using Norelco rotary shavers for the last 20+ years. I've always found them to work well and be fairly comfortable. After a few years use, instead of replacing the heads and/or battery again, I pick up the latest top of the line Norelco that's available. The Arcitec 1090 looked awesome, and I was looking forward to using it when I received it. What a disappointing product. Bottom line, it does not work nearly as well as my Quadra Action or SmartTouch XL models. I gave it some time thinking maybe my skin needed to adjust to it, but it has not improved. It just gives a mediocre, uncomfortable shave. I've since returned it, and ordered new heads for my older Norelco. I would seriously think twice before spending $200 on this product."
2,Never again a Arcitec.,"Been using Norelco's for about 25 years and have been using this one for about 2 years now. First this is the most expensive Norelco I've purchased. Second, it doesnot shave as close as my older model or previous models I've had. Third, cannot plug it in if I forget to charge it (luckily I still have my six year old model (8140xl) that does plugin) and Fourth, If I don't rinse this shaver after every shave (which would be everyday) I would get shavings all over my robe,etc. on the next shave. Note: I am buying another Norelco but not the Arcitec or SensoTouch line."
3,Rather disappointed,I have had this for 2 years now and am rather disappointed. I've replaced the cutting heads once.Pros:Elegant designWater cleaning is niceBattery lasts forever. 84 minutes on a recharge. Lasts more than a month.Very nice being able to see how many minutes of charge you have left.Charging is very quick. Less than one hour.Cons:Feels underpowered. Probably isn't but it feels that way.Shave is average at best!If I wait one or 2 days between shaves it will not cut the lighter hairs and I must use a trimer on an old shaver to cut them.The trimmer is useless for anything more than trimming a single hair or an eyebrow hair.The front plastic surface is deteriorating - looks like a layer of air or water creeping under a thin layer of plastic.The price is excessive!
2,you have to clean it everytime you use it!!,"it shaves so so I guess, not great, not bad. It is comfortable though and doesn't irritate your neck."
3,Not worth the high price,"It's a good razor, but it's not worth such a premium price. The much less expensive Norelco shavers with rotating heads do just about the same job."
2,Shoddy Construction,"Basic shave is OK. However, this seems very tinny and over designed, especially given the premium price. The trimmer simply doesn't work well; the grip is awkward, and the trimmer very narrow.Worse is the fact that the shiny metal cover on the front edge of the razor simply falls out if you put the razor in its travel case.This is a case of marketing demanding shiny, but no one remembering to make it work and durable."
2,"New Technology Doesn't ""Cut"" It","I purchased this razor for my son for Christmas thinking that since it is the newest technology in Norelco razor systems, it would provide a pretty thorough shave. And...at $200+, I don't think I was being unfair to have high expectations. However, after one week, my son called and apologetically told me that not only was this razor not giving him a close shave,he was having to go back to his old razor (the one he was trying to replace) to finish the job, especially around the neck area. I did not personally use this razor, so I don't know how fair this review will seem to the reader, but Amazon is graciously accepting our return and my son (after additional research) will purchase a different razor with the credit."
4,"Expensive, but worth it","This is a very good electric shaver. I have extremely sensitive facial hair, especially on my neck; it gets irritated at the slightest provocation. This shaver has been very good to me. It is an expensive shaver, but a worthwhile investment if you shave a lot. Even if you don't shave a lot, you will be hard pressed to find a better electric shaver anyway. I have enjoyed this product immensely. It still takes me a little while to shave when I don't do it every day, but this shaver has been better by far than any other shaver I've used, and I've used several over the years. I found mine on eBay about two years ago for $170 - see if you can get it cheaper than what it's listed for here."
2,"Quiet, good looking but uncomfortable shave","Pros: This shaver is quiet and extremely light. Also well very well designed aesthetically.Cons: Very rough shave, irritates the face. While the shaver is very light, if you are traveling you still need to bring the bulky and heavy protection case which acts as the charging station."
1,dead after 6mos,This product died on me after 6 months. What else can you say? My last razor lasted 3 years and I wanted an updated one. Poor choice.
2,Norelco Arcitec,"Shaves very close BUT I have had to replace the head each three months at about $30.00 a pop. They offered a refund but it works so well when it works, I hate to give it up. They need to work on a new head improvement."
2,fell apart,"After 2 months of light use (by my adolescent son) the shaving head spontaneously fell apart. The registration/warranty links on the Philips/Norelco were broken. I was able to get ahold of support thru their chat. Apparently, the heads are 'not under warranty'; however, they are going to send me a one-time replacement. I hope to have better luck with the second."
3,Uncomfortable if you have wide feet...,I don't recommend his shoes for people who have wide feet...But I love the design!
3,instructional briefings is what it is!,"I bought this book when i was instructing people how to fly ultralights. At the time, there was virtually no information on instructing in ultralights and this book filled this void. There are plently of flight instructor books for general aviation but this book helped in focusing on the nuances of ultralight flying.I beleive that it is not quite comprehensive enough for a student to use as a textbook. there are probably better books available for that.If you are a new instructor, this book may be of use."
3,"A little dry, but I liked it.","A pretty nice read, generally informative. I found it entertaining and a worthwhile read, even if a bit dated.I would recommend it to others also looking for general information on the subject."
4,needed addition,I purchase this phone as an addition to an exsisting system. It's easy to set up and the audio quality / reception is great. Only some minor annoyance's with the interface keep me from giving this phone a 5 star rating.
2,Not without problems,"Most cordless phones theses days are a dissappointment. The Uniden TRU8866 and TCX860 are an improvement in usability, but still have some serious shortcomings.1. Their microphone reception are very faint (to point of inaudability) on Hello direct and Plantronics headsets that work fine on other phones. Uniden's answer is ""buy a Uniden headset."" Right. Box doesn't say Only works with Uniden Headset.2. Their touch tones don't work on many voice response systems I've encountered. My other phones do.3. While handset voice quality is good, range is less than any other cordless phone I have. Barely the length of my small house.I won't buy anymore handsets for this system and can't recommend it for the above reasons. I give two stars because they do have some novel features and if they fixed the above would be great."
3,works well but lacks...,The sound quality is good and works well. But usability just isn't up to other cordless phones I have used.
3,Annoying but baby loves it,"My baby has had this since he was 5 months old and continues to go back to it at 9 months. He loves chewing on the soft orange end and playing with the little ball on the ring. It's easy to hold onto and makes some cute noises. It does get annoying sometimes because it's very sensitive to movement. I hate taking it in the diaper bag or car because the sounds go off constantly. We took a trip with it and had to bury it in a suitcase in the back of the car so we didn't have to keep hearing it. Regardless, my little guy loves it...so we endure."
1,paint comes off - don't buy,"as soon as my baby started chewing on this toy, the paint started chipping. its cute and entertaining, but its a health hazard.."
4,HARDCORE,"Let me start off this review by saying that if you are a huge Hatebreed fan then you should get this right away. Anyways, Sworn Enemy is a hardcore/metal band from NYC. There is some really great songs on this CD mainly the track ""Sworn Enemy"" which prompted me to buy this CD in the first place. Other good songs are ""As Real as it Gets"", and ""These Tears"". The reason this album didn't get the full five stars is that sometimes they can get too repetitive, and the singer's high pitched voice can get a little bit annoying. Also, they should have put some more breakdowns into their songs. I still would recommend this CD if you like this style of hardcore metal."
2,Not as good as I expected..,"Just to let everybody know Im very old school when it comes to hardcore (Cro-Mags, MadBall, and 25 ta Life) So when I heard about this band I jumped to pick it up. The band itself is terrific and the lyrics are exactly what I would expect from a NYC/or NJ hardcore band. But the vocals are simply awful. Its almost annoying to hear this guy sing. There is nothing hardcore about somebody who cries like a baby.."
3,pretty good,"If i could go in increments of half stars, this CD would be getting about 3.5. It really isn't that bad. these guys are awesome and practically define hardcore. Their sound resembles hatebreed with a little less kick. Unfortunately they suffer from the same problem hatebreed has in that I have a very hard time telling the difference between mot of the songs on the cd. Don't get me wrong, though, this is a great CD. ""Labeled"" and ""these tears"" are the best songs on here. On another note, i saw these guys live about a month ago and they're much better in person, so if you have the oppurtunity, i'd reccomend going because they put on an awesome show."
4,Good Metal,"This cd is a good example of catchy, simple songs. They arent technical or groundbreaking, but the riffs and vocals draw you in. Straight up tough guy, makes you want to go beat the snot out of people. For fans of hatebreed, madball, etc., check this out."
2,This is a little much...,"I purchased this album about a year ago in the midst of a hardcore phase I was in, but looking back, it becomes painfully obvious that this record is a shallow, simple and self-indulgent musical exposition. Is it terrible? No, but it's nowhere close to good, the vocals are typical, so there's not a whole lot of criticism for them. The musicianship appears held back, as the actual music is simple, but precise. The tracks themselves are very forgettable save the first and last track (Sworn Enemy and These Tears, I believe), but are decent for a simple, mindless headbang. Lyrically unimpressive, with random profanity and pseduo-emotion. The underlying subject matter of Sept.11 is respectable, but the delivery could be much better. Overall, ""As Real as it Gets"" is a good choice for a workout or angst record, but if one is looking for skilled musicianship, diversity and depth, steer clear."
1,Blecch!,"THIS is what passes for hardcore these days? Puh-leese. These guys couldn't hold the jocks of classic bands like Agnostic Front, Sick Of It All and Murphy's Law. In fact, pass up this stinker and look up anything by the three bands I just mentioned. The only thing the SE CD is good for is using it as a coaster."
5,Awesome Band Even Better Live,"I bought this CD after seeing them perform at Ozzfest 2003. Sworn Enemy came out with so much energy and rocking guitar riffs and vocals. They had the crowd going crazy and the pits were insane. I would recommend this CD to any metal head out there. If there is one draw back about the CD is that there is 10 songs and it's under 30 min total, but they give you bonus stuff on the CD. All and all it's a rockin CD and a great band to see live."
4,Awesome stuff...,"Once again, Akira Toriyama's ""Dragon Ball"" sparkles with these two other episodes. The storyline is great, and Goku's naive actions are unpredictable. This video is great, creating plenty of humour that could make just anybody crack up."
2,Disappointed,"I'd recommend shopping for better Superman stickers in general and then just sticking them on eggs. I wasn't impressed with this set at all. You do get the tiny stickers as pictured, so I wasn't mislead exactly. Too bad there isn't more super-hero-type, Easter-related things out there, or at least items for those children (like my nephews) less interested in the flowery decorations, pastels and frou frou decorations."
4,"a good band, but capable of more","This band is a good band. they play a fast aggressive dead kennedies influenced punk rock. with weird saterical lyrics(i can only guess because they barely make any sense, to me at least)and snotty voices this band pumped out 3 or 4 great songs on this album and 11 or 12 ok to good songs. the first two and the sixth tracks are the best easily, the rest are merely adequate or fall just short of greatness. pick this cd up if you are willing to take a minor risk."
3,Chair Caning and Seat Weaving : Storey Country Wisdom Bulletin A-16,Good beginner instructions but not all the weaves are present. Would have like more illustrations
4,decent starter book,"its ok i guess for a beginner. i have no knowlage of doing this,but this book will get me through the seats on my canoe.for learning the basics,,it fine.roy"
1,Not Helpful,"I bought this book in hopes of finding a real world guide on having more than one child since my hubby and I are trying again. Wow, besides some funny stories here and there she is bitter and angry. I am not a ""mom"" person and was probably the last person any would expect to have a child but I enjoy being a mom. The entire time reading this I kept waiting for some good advice or helpful pointers but basically it is her ranting about how things did not work when she had her kids. Nothing in the book is useful, entertaining at times, but not useful. I eventually had to put it away when she basically stated you and your marriage will fail if you have children close together in age. I don't mind a reality check on motherhood but I would not recommend this book to any mother who needs advice; it will leave you disappointed."
1,Do NOT buy this book,"Please do not recommend or buy this for anyone. Why? This author has a house cleaner, a loser husband, yells at her kids, overuses time-outs, feeds them poorly (and admits herself first), and compains about it all. This book made me feel BAD for the author...why did she even chose to BE a mother?This would be a great guide for parents of what NOT to do!This being said, I must admit that I only read 2/3 of the book, because I couldn't choke through any more (the second third was out of sheer curiosity), so perhaps by the end something good or interesting or helpful comes out of it, but I really doubt it."
3,Amazon's Stainless Steel (Cleaner-Polish),I purchased this product 10 years ago and was very pleased with it. I reordered this product with the same label that was on the product ten years ago. I was very descriptive when ordering because I wanted to be sure and get what I already had. The label was the same but the bottle and contents were not. I told them the liquid was blue....what I received was a white creme. The new cleaner is no better than anything I could pick up off of the shelf at any store.I was very disappointed in this product but I do understand that it has been ten years and they probably changed their product.......but not to the good. I should have been told that the product was no longer blue in color and that would have told me not to order it. This is the first time I have not been pleased with an order.........very pleased with past orders. Thank You
4,Favorite new music,"Heard the Venusians at the Oregon Country Fair 7/01 and they are the most refreshing, innovative group in quite some time. Each track is different. Can't sit still to this great, spacey music!"
4,Great Brush for Enamel Paint,"I have been a customer of Purdy paint brushes for many years. I finally learned the secret to better painting results. It's all in the brush. Prior to doing some research I bought a brush for all projects. Once I learned the difference in brushes matched with types of paint, my results have greatly improved. Amazon is the place for a great selection of Purdy brushes."
2,Does not come with a proper brush case,The brush is of great quality as is typical for Purdy brushes. My issue is with the lack of a proper storage case that usually comes with any brush. This one comes wrapped in a pretty lame piece of cardboard without any velcro and it'll slide up and down if you don't tape it to the ferrule. I've uploaded a picture. A decent case is very important for safely storing your brush in top condition in the long run.
5,My car's unofficial soundtrack,A night drive in the BMW with this cranked up and my riders say it's like being in a European movie. A fine and recommended experience.
1,Not for anyone to truly enjoys any type of Dance Music,"I bought this CD because I thought it was a new album released under the Euphoria name (there are about six i think so far including Ibiza, and others). I realized my mistake but listened with an open mind. The CD has good steady beats but that is about it. The vocals are lacking, as is the rest of the true electronic music. All in all, not a good buy."
5,Anoter great progressive,When I first heard this cd I knew right away that finally someone was able to put heart and soul into an incredible cd. Remixes that are finally diffrent from all of those that we have heard before. This is not just a cd of mixes put togeather but an incredible selection of trance/progressive music that makes you feel as though you are a part of it. This is a incredible cd I highly recommend it. Max English you are incredibly talented!!!!!The best cd yet.
2,Awful Taste!,"No matter how healthy this is, I just can't force myself to drink it. To me, it tasted like muddy water. Even after adding stevia, it tasted little better than sweet muddy water would. I gave it to someone who likes their teas a little more bland than I do."
3,some better collections are avaible,"of course - ""Such a shame"",""desire"" or ""Today"" are great songs but this collection that features some rare single edits and b-sides lacks a good chronological order.after ""Life what;s you make it"" 1986 pop hit we get rocking anti-commercial ""Desire"" and album ends with new-romantic styled ""time it's time""...of course form beginner fans it is nice album but for everyone who want to get better Talk talk collection get ""natural history""."
2,Doesn't Live Up To Title,"This book doesn't really teach you how to draw like Da Vinci. For example, on page 40, the author states that ""Proportion was all-important to Da Vinci, . . ."", and then she barely devotes 2 pages of text to the subject. And those 2 pages give the stale old chestnut that you get in every drawing instruction book--the hold up your pencil and mark with your thumb way of measuring. We expected a little bit more here. She also states ""Da Vinci was fond of using squares and rectangles to assess proportion"" but then she doesn't give any examples of how he used them or, more importantly, how you can use them to assess proportion. So, it seems like very superficial coverage. Since no one is now alive who actually saw Da Vinci draw 500 years ago; no one can probably tell us how he drew, and no one should pretend that they know or will show you how he did so."
2,Obscene 90's remixes!,"Her hit songs: ""Gonna Get Along Without You Now"" and ""If You Could Read My Mind"" in this cd are horrible. The first hasn't the original bass-line, while the second has a badly done Latino-flavored mix. So if you expect the original '79-'80's versions you will be disappointed! The other songs are mostly unknown. A total waste of money."
1,not the best of Viola Wills,"This CD is terrible. Not good quality, in my opinion. I mean what you really expect from Viola Wills is not on the CD. Gonna Get Along Without You Now for example is not even the original version. Bummer"
1,Not very good at all !,This is only my opinion but I would rather listen to clay aiken than this kid screaming at full lungs. She screams. Like fingernails on a chalk board. This song used to be good before but this child got a hold of it. totally ruined it. Man she is horrible.
5,Awesome!!,"Tiffany Evans stands out the most on this CD, the others don't compare to her. What a mature voice she has! I don't see how Spencer Day got to the finals, he sure was no competition for Jake just like Lisa was no competition for Tiffany. The best Star Search singers were Tiffany, Mark Mejia, and Jake."
4,Just short of a dream..,"This is one of the few US Edition Blossom (Blumchen) albums available, and despite a varied genre feel to the remixes, it's definately worth a look. Jasmine's vocals are as driven as ever, in addition to them being entirely in English. A definate treat for Blumchen's US, German, and any fan for that matter. Reccomended!"
3,Machen's layout was better.,"I cannot compare this with other Attic Greek textbooks, but I would compare it with Machen's textbook for NT Greek, and Machen compares favorably to me. Having spent a semester with this textbook, I will first say that I had a great professor. With Machen, I didn't need one. I just spent three hours getting ready for my finals, and Thrasymachus doesn't work very well outside of the classroom, in my opinion. The font looks like it's no larger than 10 point, which is hard on the eyes. I have to spend too muh time looking through the book for things relating to one chapter. Machen's text was much more compact. Everything that pertained to each chapter was contained together, including the definitions of the words which were introduced in each chapter. Sometimes I just don't feel like keeping one finger in the back, one in the middle, and one in the front."
3,"A basic guide, get it for an overview.","Hello, I bought this book on December 2006 for developing a market research for a client. I was interested in the develop of a survey and the statistical concepts you have to get for the researh, but in this particular aspect this book is just a basic guide. I think it's good for those who are not going to develop a survey research but necessary for the ones who would like to know alternatives and examples for market research. Not so applicable for Mexico, just a global idea."
1,Never Received Book!,"About 2 months after the purchase of the book; no book received. Email sent to seller has not met with a response or explanation. At this point, I could never recommend this seller. Money has been paid and no product to show for it. Not Happy!"
3,Black opal fade lotion,"I like the lotion. The cleanser did not work for me because I have oily skin. I am a black woman and I recommend the lotion to women with oily skin. It also evens out your complexion. I would not recommend the cleanser for people with oily skin, plus the cleanser does not remove make up very well."
5,Excellent Webcam,"I Love this Webcam been able to use it with windows Messenger and OOVOO VIDEO Chat and Video Conference Works Great talk to my nephew in Canada and My Brother in Vermont at the Same time and works great in dark areas with the white Balance, I even Bought an extra one for my Brother in Vermont because it works so good, If you don't have a webcam on your computer or Laptop this is perfect size for travel and works great just plug into USB PORT And use install disc and works great,"
5,MATT PRICE IS TIRED,"Though this is the first book of THE GUN series, our hero, Matt Price, is tired and weary, on the move too much and seeing too many gunfights. But he just doesn't seem to warrant any rest, some new upcoming gunny always wants to take him on.I have all the books in this series and enjoy all of them. With a veteran writer such as Lyle Brandt (Michael Newton) the interesting story just flows along. I found this series so good that I am now reading Mr. Brandt's newest series, LAWMAN, with the second of that series out at year's end.As it says on the cover, ""the gun, it's not just a weapon ... it's a way of life"" and each of the five books that make up this series proves that a true statement.If you enjoy a good western, especially ones of a short series, you just might want try this past series from the mind and pen of Lyle Brandt. I'll be surprised if you don't like them.Semper Fi."
2,Rebel Gun - Disappointing,"I found Rebel Gun to be too wordy and the subject matter to be too simplistic. Each of Brandt's books, when compared to his first one, have been less and less interesting. This latest one is almost boring and very predictable."
3,Need to complete my Blue Nile/Paul Buchanan collection.,"Have been a Blue Nile's/ Paul Buchanan fan since A Walk Across The Rooftops with one of the most beautifully created track ""Stay"" which I just don't tire listening and watching the MTV video to.Peace at Last is my least favorite of all. Remember when it first came out around the late 90's and bought it straight away but was fairly disappointed that I sold it after a few runs....now it's 2012 and Paul Buchanan has just released his simply epic and meaningful short songs - Mid Air that the need and urge to complete my Blue Nile/Paul Buchanan collection passed before me and so this is my reason to finally buy back this CD.My judgement has not changed since but must say some of the songs are starting to grow on me."
3,"Out of sync with the times, and with the bands previous work","The voice of Paul Buchanan, whom I got to know through Peter Gabriel's ""OVO"" album, stands out from the start of this 1996 album by the Scottish band, The Blue Nile. My initial feelings about it, though, are not as positive as when I heard the band's first albums: ""Hats"" and ""Walk Across the Rooftops"".With a sound that reminds of Talk Talk at times (because of their use of electronic drums/rhythm machine much like in the style of New Wave bands in the eighties) and with much more acoustic-guitar driven tunes than the previous productions, in the end you do get a comforting feeling when you listen to this music, but if you have heard some of their earlier music, it's obviously not their best production.My favorite tracks: ""Family Life"" (beautiful lyrics framed by Paul's voice and a heart-touching piano) and ""War is Love,"" a delightful tune, just like their older work."
5,Genius takes time!,"One of the most underrated bands of all time. What they lack in output, they more than make up in content. Never mediocre, contrived or sold out. They spin their own web, slowly but beautifully. Their artistry is truly brilliant, their integrity intact. By the way, you can get this album at the iTunes store for $9.90 or at the Amazon UK store for 7.46 plus shipping. To all the greedy sellers who are selling this album new for over $37, up yours! It's bad enough the record companies rip us off with their high prices. You make them look like angels by comparison."
1,TURKEY!!,"Trashy film about a family of three that move to a redneck town and quickly discover that it is run by the towns riches family. A scary looking bunch that can't afford dental care or even razors. I can suspend my belief only so far. And not with movies that want you to believe that a family that runs a town doesn't own a bathtub. I'm just assuming they don't since that percentage of the cast look like scrubs that bathe in a muddy pond. I did not like this film it had bad performances (by a cast of unknowns), cinematography (bad lighting in the last 35 minutes), lame script (100% unbelievable), bad direction (well the director did allow all of the above). AVOID THIS ULTRA TURKEY EVEN ON THANKSGIVING!!"
5,Loved it,"This book launched me into the chic-lit genre. I have since read all Fiona Walker's books and some by other authors (including Marian Keyes and Cathy Kelly) but this is still my favourite. It took me a little while to get into it (I was stumbling a bit with the many metaphors and similies), but once into it, I loved it so much that I re-read it straight away. I have a bit of a crush on the leading man and was really sad to finish the book and not see all of the characters again. I then read French Relations, which was set before Well Groomed with the same characters, and then read Well Groomed again. I haven't re-read a novel that many times since I discovered Jane Austen!"
3,good,"now i know people say fiona walker is good and all....but really the first time i read the book it really got me all confused...i must admit i was looking for a nice romantic-neaderthal kinda novel so i was dissapointed with this...but by the third time i really got into charater.the charaters are amazing and all have their stories. my best would be tash french (obviously), the heroine in the book. in between horse racing and trying to arrage her marriage ceremony, she's really confused about her fiance because deep down she's all for the hunk, hugo. well in the end it was chaos and all with who was who....i'll stop there ..."
4,"Lovely Voices, Familiar Songs","These voices are sweet, not the weird style of today, classic southern angels. Songs selected are familiar and their version of them is different but in a traditional mode.Lovely to listen to in rush hour - inspiring and positive!"
4,Jump Jump Jump,"This was one CD that I couldn't wait to get. When I was DJing in the 80's, I was spinning ""Jump Shout"", ""Rocket To Your Heart"" and ""Sex Dance"". They would pack the dance floor. From her ""Jump Shout"" LP, I had other fav. cuts ""I Thank You"" was one of them. I love this CD. The only things is the last to tracks on this CD of ""Jump Shout"" sound like $#!+......I don't know what happen to these tracks but they sound very bad. Would like to know if others have this same problem. But the saving grace is this CD has 3 versions of ""Jump Shout"" and the one that sounds the best on this CD is the version that I really LOVE..........."
3,I really don't know what I should think about her,"It's always the same thing with Blümchen. Her earlier songs sound all soooo similar. The lyrics are so meaningless and her voice sounds very ""computermade""But on the other hand it's such a nice track. Technobeats with Vocals - apleasure tovdance toYou must find out on your own if you like it or not."
4,"Blümchen Hit: ""Du und Ich""","A maxi-single from German techno teen Blümchen's first album in 1996, ""Du und Ich"" features the Hamburg native's familiar mix of techno beats and sugar-sweet singing. Perfect for either dancing or easy listening, ""Du und Ich"" is one of my favorite Blümchen songs, due not only to its simple, yet at times spooky lyrics, but also its incredibly active techno beat. As Blümchen's music progresses and she shifts from techno to pop, ""Du und Ich"" is a wonderful reminder of her earlier, and frankly better, selections. I highly recommend this product."
2,disappointed,"I am very disappointed with this item. After a few months outside, all of them broke in the middle. I followed the directions, too."
4,this game is addictive,this game is highly addictive and fun..its good cheap fun!..I received it by snail mail within three days of ordering!
4,Ok Album,"Good Album, nothing flashy but good. Kind of John Denverish, bland at certain points. Would really like to see what he would sound like if he decided to actually sound like he is having fun instead of trying to sound deep and meaningful. His posturing comes off like someone trying hard to be deep, but he just can't get there and it sounds deep and meaningless. He has good chops, but is to wound-up tight with trying to be some kind of ultra-senstive poet. I say matt get a strat, listen to some stones albums, tune a few songs to an open G, and just rock with some abandon. Or better yet grab some beatles albums, like say the white album, and revolver, and get some cool melodies, and some wit. Also listen to some Kinks, or The Replacements. The world does not need any boring counting crows or dave matthews clones, but the world does need some good rock music. Go to nashville and look up Hans Rottenberry and Brad Jones, and just go from there."
4,Spacey Studio Magic,"This is a CD that is truly unique among others by artists in the Jam Band/Hippy-Hop/Psychedelic realm. The works of this album can only be produced in the studio, where track fading, complex effects, and just simple ""spacy-ness"" are available and abused by this usually live band. This is jamming of a very original nature, though Mindless Dribble, the fifth track, is often just a little too much experimentation for the atmosphere of the album. Is it worth getting? Definitely."
2,ehh...,"They missed the perfume, I missed the jam. If you are looking for intelligent, creative, and innovative jambased music, get the disco biscuits' first album (Uncivilized Area,) cuz you're not going to find it here. All it is, like everyone before me has said, is a bunch of electronica poorly put together on a cheap drum machine that gets repetitous pretty fast."
3,trance fusion distilled to catchy electronica...,"I had very high expectations for this record when I heard that it was going to be electronica oriented. Knowing what the Biscuits are capable of live and based on the strength of Uncivilized Area I was sure of an epic jam/electronic masterpiece. What we got instead, was a very respectable first attempt at this genre. This album flows very well and bubbles with electronic greatness at times. However, moments like the slow ""jam"" in Mindless Dribble seem like a quickly pasted in middle section - While the beginning of that song is one of the most creative pieces of music I have heard in a long time. Highwire is incredibly catchy and Spacebird is possibly the most solid song on the record. I was really anticipating this record, which may have harmed it in my opinion initially, yet I now enjoy it for the solid well-sequenced effort which it is."
1,Very disappointing.,"Unlike ""Uncivilized Area"" and ""Senor Boombox,"" I was not at all impressed with this CD. I hate to say it, because I absolutely love Disco Biscuits, but this CD honestly just sucks. It's pretty much nothing like their other albums, it's just some weird electronic [poop]. Don;t get me wrong, though-they are an awesome band, one of my very favorites, but do yourself a favor and don't buy this CD."
5,One for the books,"I first heard They Missed the Perfume in 2001. It was my first experience with the Disco Biscuits, who would become a favorite band of mine. The Disco Biscuits themselves may or may not be the most revolutionary band depending on whom you speak too, but there is no doubt in my mind that this album should and perhaps will be considered one of greatest underground rock albums of this generation. From the first creeping notes of ""Highwire"" its clear the album is different. Not only does it sound like nothing else, it doesn't even sound like the Disco Biscuits. From the sweeping guitar melody of ""Spacebirdmatingcall"" to the heartfelt electronic beauty of ""Home Again"" and culminating with the composed perfection of ""I Remember When,"" you can truly hear the evolution of a concept all the way through. Yes, this album takes patience just as The Disco Biscuits themselves do. But those willing to take the risk will find a rare gem in this studio album."
3,They Are Truly Best Live...,"Being an incredible Biscuits fan, I know what they are capable of live, so I assumed it would translate to the studio with well improvised grooves.Unfortunately I found the songs to be a little short and leaving me wanting more. Not to mention Highwire and Mindless Dribble are products of the same song! Spacebird is a great song, probably one of the best they have written as well as Haleakalah Crater with its orchestrated middle jam. But for the most part, being an avid Biscuits listener and concert goer, I am left with only a taste of the wonderful music they produce."
2,"""They Miss The Point"" is more like it.","They might be a jam band, but that's no excuse for meandering."
2,just aight,I'm a Big Etta James fan&always look toward Her Newer Projects but this Set seemed by the numbers&never showed me much.pretty much was just digging Her voice but the music never caught on with me fully.
3,Average DVD,"This was the first DVD of its kind that we bought and I think it will be the last, unless the kids develop a greater interest in it. I think it is hard for them to follow. I would say it is average though, since there is nothing really to dislike about it--the kids just aren't interested."
3,Shivaree who?,Most people had never heard of Shivaree until this CD came out and I've been listening to her for years. The Song Goodnight Moon is just so cool and different from anything else I've ever heard. Love it love it love it!
4,great tea,Great full flavor tea. Bags are exceptional quality and have not leaked on us yet. Tea/spice pieces are large and identifiable not the dust found in some other bags.
4,Great book for anyone starting photography,"This is a great book for beginners in photography. Covers pretty much everything basic in photography. It starts off very much similar as most general how-to photography books do with explanations on equipment, light, form, and how to compose a good photography. Second half contains different situations and subjects and how to approach them...that's pretty much the format of photography books...kinda boring...haha. It does contain a lot of good pointers even for advanced photographers but since photography is such a broad subject, it will require further reading in photography books on whatever subject you're interested in pursuing (i.e. weddings, fashion, etc) as you become more advanced. I highly recommend this book over most photography books for anyone starting, but it is dated so if you're primarily into digital photography, this book will not be good for you."
5,Great for beginers through intermediate,"A well written book that focus on taking great pictures with the equipment you have (35mm) is covered mostly.The pictures in the book are awesome like National Geographic Magazine!There is a lot of knowledge put into this book, for the money it's a good buy. The size makes it a handy addition to my camera bag."
2,1999 edition,"Don't buy this book if you want a newer edition. I bought and received the 1999 edition. It barely talks about the digital world. Good tips, but all the new stuff is not there."
5,Very good book for beginning photographers....,"If you're just starting in photography as a hobby this is an excellent choice to pick up and learn from. It's got serveral interviews with well established photographers who give opinions on everything from lighting to equipment care etc. The beginning of the book focuses on basics such as film speed, shutter speed, aperture settings and the like and everything is covered very carefully and explained fully.Being a book from National Geographic you would expect some amazing pictures to be included and there are. There's a few hundred pictures throughout the book, many of which are extremely beautiful. Everything from wildlife to portaits, landscapes to sports, etc."
5,Great for beginners,"This was my first photography book after I received my first SLR. It's an extremely quick and easy read for the novice and I go back to it every now and then for reference. This book contains useful case studies on famous photographers and their techniques. After reading the book, I immediately noticed a difference in my photos.Most of the National Geographic photography books cover the same material. If you plan on buying one, this is the one."
3,Expected more...,"This is a good photography book. It gives you a nice overview of making great pictures. But it doesn't explain a great deal about exposure and other aspects of photography in detail.I wanted to understand the basics in depth. So, on my friend's recommendation, I got 'Nature photography field guide' by John Shaw. Wow! it is the book to understand the basics of exposure and all other aspects of photography in a greater depth. This book is just worth for it's great pictures! I'm sure you love it!!In a nutshell, if you want a general overview and tips on photography (or if you are an intermediate level photographer), buy this book . On the other hand, if you'd like to grasp the basics of photography(or if you are a beginner), then get the John Shaw's book mentioned above.Good luck!"
5,Great Guide for Great Pictures,"It is one of the best photography books I've read! The examples and explanations are very clear and to the point. The writers shared their knowledge in a way that I can apply them to all kinds of photography. The book also includes good and objective comparison of different kinds of films to different kinds of picture formats, cameras that are very helpful to make a decision. I strongly recommend this book, especially for beginners."
4,Excellent Book!,"This is a very easy to follow photography guide for just about any level photographer,with information about cameras; how they work, different types and features and how to choose one best for you.It has clear and easy to understand information and I highly recommend it.It also is a very convenient size making it easy to take along with you anywhere."
3,"Good, but I've seen better","I purchased the Kodak Guide To 35mm Photography for a friend, and being aprofessional photographer, I thought that the National Geographic Photography Field Guide: Secrets to Making Great Pictures would be a perfect source of advanced knowledge for me...but I was wrong. The National Geographic book is good, but the Kodak Guide is much better. Both books start with the basics, but Kodak fills its book with much more information and far more (and usually better) photographs. Somewhat thin, more expensive and skimpy on details, the National Geographic Field Guide also contains the stupidest thing I've ever heard a photographer say: `If every shot on your roll is perfect, then you've failed'. Failure can be a very important learning tool and you must try new things and risk failure in order to grow, but if every shot on your roll is perfect it usually means that you know what the heck you're doing."
4,"A GOOD, BASIC GUIDE FOR ALL BEGINNERS!","While I agree that much of what is printed here is very basic information, the guide is excellent resource material for the novice just venturing into the world of photography. The elementary aspects such as exposure, film speed and composition are discussed here and while the material may seem far to simple for some readers, it is a great book for beginners. The reader will also find some terrific examples of ""professional photographs"" which are sure to inspire almost every avid photographer. The book is certainly worth the price and would make an ideal gift for those just beginning to explore the magic, wonder and art of photography. The quality of any book bearing the name ""National Geographic"" speaks for itself."
3,A nice place to start...,"If you don't have a lot of photgraphic experience, this is a great book to start out with. It intorduces many important subjects but I was disappointed with its lack of depth."
1,Not for photographers,"The book contains the really most basic and well known tips - nothing more, you better look in the internet and find far more informative websites. I gave it one star beacuse the amazing photos in the book which made by wonderful photographers. Buy a album insted or Michael Langford's guid if you are a beginner who wants to learn the basics."
4,good information for photographer,"This book is more National Graphic Photographer written for Photographic fan and user,if you like photo, you may need it . it like the gulide book for evey one . if you haven't ,i suggest you may have1"
5,One of my very favorites,"This book in concise, well-written, and inspirational. Don't think this is only a book for beginners, though it would be my number one choice as a gift for someone interested in starting a serious approach to photography. It's full of clear explanations of what are often misunderstood concepts (e.g., perspective), useful tips, and, best of all, the wonderfully interesting and inspirational ""World of Subjects"" section where we learn about some NG photographers. They vary widely in style, subject, and equipment choice, but every one is worth reading about and their tips alone are worth the price of this book.Highly recommended for both beginners and experienced photographers. This is a book I return to again and again."
2,Not for Advanced Photographers,"This is a great book for beginners, but I would not recommend it for advanced photographers. Published by National Geographic, I expected this book to be advanced, but it turned out otherwise. The book's content tends to be repetitious and basic. Basic photography issues like the difference between slow and fast film, basic compositions, how exposure works are included, but the book does not discuss these issues ""deeply."" Very important issues like exposure charts are not there (the kind that shows you which f stop and shutter speed to use in many shooting conditions like shooting the city light, sunset, lightning, etc.) I also expected the zone system to be discussed, which is also not there. Since this book is a field guide, those issues are very important and should have been included in the book."
5,NGFG,Great price! Was able to order one week before it was needed and received the book sooner than anticipated. Very helpful resource for beginner photographers.
3,Handy for those interested in widening your photography knowledge,"still seems a bit out of date, in regard to the latest SLRs, but great to learn techniques, film photography, and the like. still recommend."
4,Good Block,"Yes it is just a large block of wood with slots cut in, but if you have a large collection of Henckel knives and outgrew your block or have a few random knives you would like to store together with your set, then this block is the way to go. Looks good on the counter, knives go in on their side, room for a medium cleaver, steel, and shears, as well as 8 steak knives."
2,Overpriced.,This item is really overprice for a piece of wood with slots.Cheaply made in China. You can buy the 19 slot version for $39.95 on Amazon.
4,Great value and quality,"I had a knife block from a previous Henckels knife set. Unfortunately, the knives were a starter set and weren't of great quality, so we upgraded to some Victorinox knives. This knife block accommodates 2 santoku knives, my new Victorinox knives (paring knife, 8"" and 10"" chef knives), and my previous Henckels knives. I still have a few empty slots.The knife block is a bit bulky, but I expected this due to the number of slots. I am happy to finally have all of my knives in one place."
3,This is a decoration not a toy. Very nice as a decoration,This makes a nice decoration. Shipping was high but it did come quickly and in great shape.
5,One of two Wes Classics,"This cd and ""Full House"" are Wes Montgomery's two best cd's, and they are both live. If you like the one, get the other. If you have both, buy anything Wes did on Riverside. All those cd's are great!"
5,the very best,"The cd arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Thank you. The music is beyond criticism: the Wynton Kelly trio with Paul Chambers on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums had been playing together for years in the Miles Davis Quintet, the combination with Wes Montgemery clearly works to bring out the best in all of them: it is all of such high quality, so effortless, so fresh."
4,great for kids,This book works wonderfully for my 8 yr old aspiring author! Easy to use and find correct spelling.
3,Same Problem As Susan,"I don't know what Susan and I are doing wrong, but I have had the same problem. The doll seems to dry quickly if all she does is float briefly on the water, but after my daughter helped her beloved ""baby"" swim underwater she has failed to dry (after more than a day and quite a few attempts to squeeze her out and dry her with towels).My daughter has a great time with her, and fortunately doesn't want to take her to bed at night, so she is still a worthwhile member of our family. She does smell like she is taking too long to dry, though, and I am unsure about how long it will be before she starts to smell too bad to keep."
1,SOAKING WET..... AWFUL,"Yes, this doll ""floats"" in the tub, but if your child wants to take this doll to bed after bathtime FORGET IT !!!!! The doll is soaking wet. I purchased two of these dolls for my girls and they were both soooooo disappointed. They bathed their baby dolls and dressed them for bed......... then their bed sheets were soaking wet.Don't waste you money or your time on this rip-off."
2,dont slag Baby Born....or else!!!!!!!,"i am a Baby Born defender and I want to say to M hutchison (the neurotic mom who babies her kids too much) that Zapf has NEVER, EVER marketed baby born as a potty training doll. they have marketed her as a friend, a sibling-prep doll, a baby doll, but never for potty training. so don't be dissapointed if your baby born doesnt teach potty training. and dont slag her just because youre too lazy to read and folow the instructions and actually TRY to make her work. who wants crappy ugly fat baby tubbles anyway? she sucks."
2,Incomplete and Poorly Remastered,"First of all, as another reviewer mentioned, this collection is not complete as its title would suggest (it's missing Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, and Cookies & Egg Nog is actually Joy to the World).What's worse is that this collection is a casualty of The Loudness War. The original CDs, produced in the '90s sound great. This collection was remastered with today's standards and sounds awful with audible clipping and distortion. It's not for audiophiles or anyone else who cares about sound quality.Considering that you can get used copies of the original 3 CDs for the same price as this new collection, go with the original masters. The 4 new songs you get on this collection don't make up for the 2 that are missing along with this collection's poor remastering."
4,H0-Ho_Hoey,"This is the best Christmas music I have ever had. Some of the music is a bit too old school for me, but a lot of it is very, very good in a sense that it draws a good feeling from within."
5,Merry Christmas,This is a very cool cd. Every song on it rocks. Not your your average xmas songs. Gary is one of the best guitar players I have ever heard.I played this cd all xmas season had no complaints from anybody.
5,A Rocked UP Christmas,Gary Hoey takes the traditional Christmas songs and gives them a hard rock intstramental twist. He also shows a soft side by keeping the true ballads soft and precise. Something different and great fun for the holidays.
5,Christmas with an edge,Tired of the same sorry old Christmas songs? Let Gary Hoey liven things up with these shredding versions. Blistering guitar work will jingle your bells. Have yourself a Heavy Metal Christmas!
4,Spa Perfect - Perfect for My Softub,"I have a Softub from Montana Softubs ([...]) and use Spa Perfect sold from my Essentials dealer. I am unsure if this is any different from this product here as the bottle looks exactly the same but mine has a sticker on it that says formulated for vinyl lined spas, which is what Softubs are.When I use the tub in the summer, it gets scummy due to all the sun tan lotion and oils put on skin. since I use my Softub almost every day, and also use sun tan lotion of some kind every day in the summer, the scum will come.I was at my wits end last year, but then I started using Spa Perfect and I only needed a few applications to have my scum problem solved. My water is clear and clean and no brown water rings or scummy bubbles.I recommend this product to any one that is using Softubs for sure. Call your Essentials dealer to find out more today."
4,UNUSUAL SOLO EFFORT FROM EX CRIMSO DRUMMER!,"Well being a crimson afficianado and collecting all their stuff i was a bit dubious about this, but it really is rather good and it has Ian McDonald on sax/flute which is even better. Ian has a pretty decent voice and his drumming is spot on and his songs are top notch. It is VERY crimsonish paticularky on 'too much dogma' and 'castaway' (shame the intro didn't last longer) there is mellotron aplenty and it could well fit into 'islands' no problem. There is some Beatle-ish chorus's throughout and the band are tight and if the latter tracks are like Steely Dan with the funky bass lines so what! It does lose its way toward the end, but it is a good and unusual debut album. Actually if you pine for early Crimson or rate Pete Sinfeild's 'still' album you could do a lot worse than buy this!"
5,Timely book explains pathway for all disease,"Jack Challem couldn't have written a more timely book.Millions of Americans are taking anti-inflammatory drugs and drug companies are rapidly pursuing the development of more potent anti-inflammatory drugs? Why? Because inflammation is the pathway for all disease. Pouring more drugs on a burning fire may not be the answer. A diet, plus supplements, is probably the best way to forstall disease. Jack Challem describes the way to do this. --- Bill Sardi, Knowledge of Health, Inc."
4,helpful,"I bought this book because I have fibromyalgia and the only thing that showed up abnormal on my tests was ""inflammation"". This book helped me understand what was causing my pain and the supplements to take to reduce the inflamation. I have used the suggestions in this book and Meggs' book to reduce my pain."
5,Great book!!,"a very good book, easy to read life changing reading. Tough plan to follow but can make remarkable changes if followed.A leader in the field."
1,this book has missed the point,"Another book offering limited help to those with asthma. As a sufferer for long enough until I learned about the Buteyko method. If you wish to take control of your condition, this is the only therapy that works and does it very well.Asthmatics before you buy this book- research the Buteyko method for asthma. You will feel considerably better as I did in a couple of weeks. There are also self help books available to allow you make progress at minimum cost.The results it has given me have wanted me to wake the world up about what you can do by correcting and changing your overbreathing.Good luckMike"
4,Health Enthusiast,"I really liked this book. I thought it was very informative and included great information on how to change your diet to obtain better health. It opened my eyes to some of the ways we are harming our bodies by the foods we eat. I had read some of the information before in a couple health newsletters I subscribe to, so I felt the book was right on. I highly recommend it."
1,Death Valley,"I ordered this new DVD for my mother-in-law's birthday, and a copy of one for us. My husband's relatives discovered DeathValley and I thought this would give the story of and a tour of Death Valley. It was all about how global warming is ruining everything in Death Valley. We did not like it for the most part, there were some interesting things to learn about, but it all went back to global warming. We would not recommend it."
1,Blown Out!,"The RE-Mastering on this ""Best of"" is terrible. The sound is blown out and distorted. If SOUND QUALITY is an issue for you then don't buy this album."
2,"""Elvis, The living one?""","I don't like reviewing music as it's more often than not a matter of taste. ""watching the detectives is one of my all time favs. Great reggae rythem and great lyrics"" A handful of other songs are ok but it's a 2 CD set and not cheap and boy oh boy do I wish I had just bought the original CD with ""W.T.Detectives"" The hand full of (small baby hands) will be ripped to PC & the rest can gather dust on a shelf. Yawn!"
2,Great selection awlful sound. Shame on you Rhino!,Wow finally a great Elvis Costello compilation comes out and what a disappointment. What happened to the great Rhinosonic sound?? The sound on this cd is muddy and uneven. Some tracks sound not bad but generally the sound is terrible on this cd. Save your money don't waste it on this one. Shame on you rhino for releasing such a poor sounding cd.
1,Boring Garbage!!!,I know this guy has been around for a while. But I just can't help but notice just how horrible his music is. His keyboardist is more annoying than a harmonica. And his songs are all BORING! I've produced better stuff in the toilet!
1,An Unattended Fire,"Steve Sherbondy's insight into child-rearing is shallow. His counseling methods on the other hand have become ""an unattended fire"" and he is under investigation by the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation. He is no longer practicing needless to say."
3,Helpful for you,"Over there is a book that tells you a lot of how United states was unprepared for the war. Although it skips around a lot it is very imformative about what the United States had to do to get their men better prepared for the war, such as where they got all their airplanes and equipment. It tells about how trenches were made. It has a big thing in there about the flu which was very long and poped alot over the chapters of the book.It also talked briefly about some of the battle The United States was involved in and who got the Medal of Honor and how they got it. There was a main part about the different ways they had to control the submarine threat. In many different ways this book was good and bad but over all the book was very good and I recommend reading it."
2,Ignores the historical significance of the flu pandemic,"Although Mr. Farwell provides an excellent narrative about the participation of the United States in the Great War, he neglects to discuss one important aspect of the conflict. The great flu pandemic. In fact, the flu caused the Americans many more deaths than did battle wounds. I have read about three fourths of the book as of now, and the flu has been mentioned twice. I find this totally inadequate. By ignoring the flu, he makes his entire book worthless."
4,Licensed To Kill,"this is most definitely spy music. if i was james bond, and i'm cruising around town looking for fun, this cd, along with baxter and portishead, would be in my collection of cds. skindive uses pounding electronic rock and smooth orchestrated sounds to deliver a rock solid album. it blows me away how bands (and there are only a few who can pull it off well) can combine those two sounds, polar opposites, and make it sound beautiful. the lead singer's vocals are out of this world. absolutely perfect. she sounds the best on ""sweetness"" but is consistent throughout. the songs go from dramatic (""space-age lullaby"") to awesomely loud (""skindive"") and never leave you disappointed. for people who like garbage, snake river conspiracy, and kidneythieves, this one should definitely not be missed."
3,Be Prepared,"The RealAudio clips don't tell the whole story. One of the other reviewers compared Skindive to spy movie theme music. Maybe, but it's definately not Bond or Derek Flint. This stuff is dark and menacing. It took a few spins for me to appreciate this cd. The guitar player has real talent, and if your in the mood to brood, this is probably a good choice."
5,Globalullabies,"This CD and another one by the same artist, Accoustic Attitude are amoung the favorites in my music collection. Extremely soothing combination of instruments and vocals help me to relax and reflect. I listen to it all the time, and wish that I could find more music by Freyda."
5,Wonderful,"Lullabies from around the world, but it's Epstein's soothing, sweet voice that makes the record stand out. I'd happily listen to her sing the phone book. You don't have to have kids to love this record -- I've got it permanently in my car's CD, and it keeps me far, far from road rage. --Guy Richardson"
5,Impressive...,"As a lover of both alot of various rock and electronic music, the thing that bugs me about a great deal of the bands trying to ride the ""rock band with synth"" new new wave coatails is that half of them are completely lifeless and uninteresting. However this album by White Rose Movement that i've spent quite a bit of time trying to get was worth all the effort. ""Kick"" delivers a great energy and spirit that demands attention and multiple listenings that just get better with each spin. My only real complaint is that the mixing could of probably been done better in a few places, but its no reason to not pick this album out. With the great vibe on the cd, I can only hope WRM comes to the US soon so I can indulge in what I imagine is a great live show."
4,See it live!,"I bought this album after hearing the ""Oh, the Grandeur"" CD a few times. At first the new album shocked me and I feared I wouldn't like it. However, after seeing Bird perform in Chicago I have come to appreciate ""The Swimming Hour"" so much more. The group is seriously talented and unbelievably entertaining. If you're not sure, see them live! It is incredible. I'm so glad I can take them home with me and listen any time I want!"
1,a depressing change,"oh how very depressingly bad this cd is! I bought it on pure faith after being thrilled with his previous efforts, only to be very sadly disappointed with it. It lacks the passion and creativity the Oh! The Grandeur and Thrills held. I get shivers of revulsion just thinking of some of the songs. I respect his desire to grow stylistically, but I just don't care for the boring songs he's produced. It honestly does depress me, because his previous combination of modern meets swing was exactly to my liking. People might suggest I turn to Squirrel Nut Zippers, but their poppish shallow jazz is no consolation -- not even worth comparison. I'll look into his other cds, but he's lost my trust."
1,"The ""Sinking"" Hour","I think Andrew Bird is not swimming, but drowning his talnet in shallow(no pun intenede) pop music. This is a commerical, and not in the least bit an artistic release. Bird & his band are not in the least even a little creative or improvisational or witty as they were on Thrills & Grandeur."" This is strictly a ""throwaway"" release, unworthy of having the name Andrew Bird on it. I wish great artists wouldn't compromise thier greatness to sell out. This is commercial, shallow, unsoulful, pop music at it's worst."
1,the DROWNING hour,"Wow was I shocked at the lack of artistic quality on this cd. I am used to being able to buy an Andrew Bird cd, and get ""hot"" creative and even improvised gypsy jazz with touches of 1920's/30's period music! However on this cd, there is nothing but very shallow pop music, with no artistic value what-so-ever! A very bad descision of bird's part, as I'm sure this cd has lost most of his fans who expect much more then this. His last two releases featured jazz, blues, syncopation, swing, improvisation, creativity, and highly artistic music, but this release is just like a blow on the head with a crowbar, it's shockingly painful to listen to, and boring, and not interesting. Skip this one, and let's hope he goes back to Squirrel Nut Zippers sounding music, after all, I oanly started buying Bird's cd's because SNZ sold out to comemrcialism on thier latest bizzare cd Bedlam. So skip this if you liek giid music."
1,The DROWNING hour,"A horrible effort by Bird, who has up until now had my respect, as a highly artistic and creative player and leader. Usually his sets where he is leader, are full of hot gypsy jazz, New Orleans syncopations, hot jazz rhythms reminiscent of 1920's/30's period. Also Bird usually swings a bit on his violen. And though he is no copy of Eddie South or Joe Venuti, he sounds like a virtiouso violenist from that period. This set finds the very talented fiddle master wasting his talents on shallow pop music, unworthy of him or the band, which needs to go back to hot jazz. This is a sellout cd, and it's a throwaway disc, not even one song is interesting. No solos, no improv, no creativity, no style, no nothing!!!"
2,Boring!,"Some of the pictures in this book are pretty fine, but the actual writing (in my opinion) lacks a lot. Author seems determined to link female vampires to lesbians. One definition of vamp is: Seductive Woman, a woman who uses her sexual attractiveness for the seduction and manipulation of others. This is the traditional form and is also considered short for vampire. Vampire doesn't indicate sexual preference. Overall, I would not rate this book as a page turned in any way, shape, or form."
2,Not too good,"I'd have to agree w/ others that this cd isn't very good. But i'm a big Bone fan so its worth getting in new or used or just download it. One problem I had w/ this cd is its hard to hear wtf there saying unless u got headphones on ur cd player or discman. My favorite song would have to be Roll Wit Us, I think the beginning of that song is cool. And Game is an ok song too"
3,BIZZY BONE ALWAYS GREAT!!!!,"This cd is trash, but i still love bizzy bone, all the hits he had had made up for it. So Lil Ripsta...HOLLA AT YO BOY AND KEEP IT STRAIGHT UNDER GROUND."
2,Barly Decent,"I was at Best Buy and wanted a cd and I'm huge bone fan and once I saw bizzy bone on it i picked it up, but yet I didnt know how bad Double R is, honestly he sounds like someone trying to rap like tupac, if you put it on someone might think thats old tupac music. Another reason i wanted it was the ""proud to be an american"" song mainly because Bizzare for D12 is it in, and that has to be the only song i go back to listin to, some humor in it, i wouldnt buy this cd if i could take it back. So many other better cds for whatever music you like.. i would have to give it a below adverage 2 and quilty doesnt seem like something you would hear in 2005"
2,Not For Mixing,"No, this was not the ""Best of"" Blue Lazer. I bought this CD for the song Dance Party and was disappointed in the version it contained. The 12"" version I used to have was way better; which started out with the ""were gonna dance"" intro.The version on the CD might be OK for short radio play, but for club mixing it will not work: DJs, do not waste your money on this version if you want to mix it. Find the old 12"" instead."
3,Not shaped like the picture.,"This racquet cover is not shaped like the picture. It is in the shape of the racquet itself...with narrow slim handle. I thought a water bottle would easily fit inside with the racquet, since the picture looks as though there would be plenty of room for the ""extras"". I was wrong. I probably would return it if it wasn't from Santa to my son. Ah well....you can't always judge a book by its cover!"
1,I dont like it!,I dont like it at all. The resolution of the game is ugly. If i'd new.. i should not buy this game. Can't you refund me if i send you bacck the game ? Or can i exchange this game for another.Thanks
1,Low Tech and Boring,"Sadly I played Deus Ex, Sims and Rune before I got this game and it felt like I went back to 1994 in game play technology.The idea of an army of cloned creatures coming at you on a flat plane while you blast your ever more boring weapons at them is sort of like playing those 80's D&D games on a 386.The multiplayer is nothing more than a fashion show with all these characters sporting their new feathered hat or pin stripe magic wand. So, so dull. I hope Diablo 3 is more like Asherons Call."
2,Poopy.,"Plot is nonexistant. performance stinks.. hardware support as well.. resolution (640X480) also stinks.. gameplay linear.. multiplayer too prone to 12 year old kids killing off people who have actually not cheated and played the stinking game...addictive.. and not that much fun the second time around, which is the ultimate test of a game."
3,Is this a Sequel?,"Though I love the rich storyline of Diablo II, I find it hard to believe this is a sequel. The gameplay has hardly changed, the powers are similar. What's different from Diablo 1? The scenery and the graphics quality. So many times Blizzard releases an expansion, why not now? There is nothing done in Diablo II that Diablo 1 could not have handled.In all, I gave this game three stars for its story and ideas. It has an interesting metaplot that unravels as you progress. The graphics are also spectacular, though sometimes they seem choppy or cartoonish. Would I recommend this game? Absolutely. Will you enjoy it? I did, but I just don't see the difference from the original."
5,One of the Best I've Ever PLayed,"Of course you know that on a Mac it's hard to find good games, and finding the Mac version of good games when they come out. I give a hand to Blizzard for quickly coming out with a Mac version after the PC version came out. Diablo II is awesome. I can't say much more than that. I own the first one and Starcraft. Blizzard does a great job with all their games."
3,"Great Game, but slow performance","The game is great, graphics are slow. I have a B/W G3 400Mhz with 512MB of RAM and a Radeon Graphics Card and i can only get 15-20FPS (thats Frames Per Second) but when fighting a boss or when alot of monsters come onto the screen the FPS drops to 5-10FPS and that is totaly unplayable. I have found out that when playing Online i get 25-35FPS I dont know why but I do. So I guess what i am trying to say is if you dont have a G4 Mac then dont waste your time or money buying this game. But if you still want it please download the demo first then buy the game if you think it is OK."
3,Pugad Baboy is Hilarious!,"Pugad Baboy has gone a long way from its comic strip beginnings and over the years, it hasn't lost its outstanding ability to humor a lot of people. It's too bad that this book is written only in Filipino preventing others from enjoying its contents. The fact that Pugad Baboy often dwells on the quirks of Philippine society makes this book a more enjoyable read. Filipinos abroad would surely be in stitches once they grab a hold of this book. Brosia, Polgas, Mang Dagul and the rest of the Pugad Baboy community shall forever be the toast of Philippine comic strips. Kudos to Pol Medina!"
5,Another hit to skip a heartbeat over..,"This is definately one of the better Blossom (Blumchen) US Imports, in English. The vocals on the tracks Heart To Heart and Pink Cloud make this album worth buying, but the fun doesn't stop there. Add in the happy hardcore-ish feel of Little Sattelite and You & Me, and you have a winner. If you're a German techno, happy hardcore/Gabber fan, or even a music lover in general, this one is a must. 5 Stars and a salute!"
3,Why Edit The Title Song?,"If you're expecting the album version of the title track at 14:33, then you might be disappointed. Don't let the cover fool you as this CD version of ""If There's Love"" is only 11:29. This probably won't seem like much of a difference to most people but since you are interested in ""Amant,"" then this might matter to you. I own many other ""Best of ..."" CDs distributed by ""Hot Productions, Inc."" and the quality has been fair to good. However, the quality of this ""CDR"" is poor and will not play on most older car CD players unless formatted for CDR and CDRWs. Mmmmm. If your car CD player is less than 4 years old and any version of ""If There's Love"" will do, then this CD might be for you. There is nothing special about the other 6 tracks on this CD so perhaps there should only be 2 long perfect tracks as on the original 1978 album. But that's just me."
1,ANOTHER CD-R,What's going on? Be careful when you buy a cd from Hot productions there's a company in Florida that are releasing this cds as new the quality is terrible and the print looks cheap .-I was praying this cd to be an original but it wasn't even the condition of the cd inside was bad.
4,very good disco music,I was wondering if i was able to get those titles!! i was really surprised and now i`m hooked!!!
3,"Welcome to Vamoose, OK","Amanda Hazard, CPA, and Nick Thorn, police chief, are engaged again with Velma, the beautician from hell, and her niece Beverly Hill planning the wedding. Giving Amanda the chance to solve the mystery of the death of Frank Lemon, used car dealer. Thorn is accused of causing the death of the shady Lemon and has been relieved of his duties as chief. Amanda is going to clear his name before the wedding. A funny, delightful story that reads quickly and is satisfying."
2,Not Worth The Money,I was disappointed in this book. I found the ideas in the book very old fashioned and most often ugly. Th only good thing about the book is at the back of the book she shows how to make each seperate flower. But the craft ideas are a DEFINITE pass.
1,Don't ignore the negative reviews for this item!,"I was having a hard time deciding which karaoke player to buy, but liked the sound of a 5 disc changer. I read the reviews, many of which were negative, but decided to try it anyway with the hope that they were wrong. When it came, it buzzed, clicked, and whirred just like another reviewer had said it would. No matter what I did, it would not play the discs I tried (regular or karaoke). Then, it wouldn't give me my cd back. After some effort (button pressing, shutting it down) it finally gave me back the disc. Fortunately, I had ordered it from a store and was able to return it--otherwise I would have been stuck with shipping costs."
1,DVG555 5 disc player,"I ordered this thing and got it a couple weeks later from Sound Factgory Pro in Brooklyn New York. They sent it after about 2 weeks. It would not eject disc one tray, the buttons would work only after hitting them multiple times. Never got it to play, then i sent it back and recieved another one and guess what, The disc tray would not eject. The buttons dont work half the time. Piece of crap. Stay away from this machine and do not order nothing from Sound Factory Pro online. They gave me the run around for a month and a half and never returned any of the 5 emails I sent them. Terry, GA."
1,Horrible - Does not work!!!,I bought this product to use as a 5 disk DVD player. I could not get it to play a DVD at all. Could not get my DVD's back out of the unit. This is a horrible product and I would discourage anyone from buying it.
1,Item was delivered broken,"I received the item today and even paid $30 for faster shipping. The disc changer is broken on the right side. I finally noticed this after it kept opening after I put in a disc. Sometimes, it would keep the disc inside and not open. This is a shame, because I needed it for a karaoke gig this weekend. Be careful what you purchase."
5,Very good 2 step,"Steady 2 Step by Kristine Blond who soon after this turned into rather pop-ish songs. ""Love shy"" was so far her best and biggest hit"
4,Warm and happy,"Here's a collection of old Andalusian instrumental pieces, with the standard exotic instrumentation, that takes a new approach to the material. Instead of the hard-edged, bouncy style usually adopted, we have a relaxed, almost lush sound, that some might say is inauthentic, but made me feel warm and happy -- and led me to think this might have been just the way it was played when it was written. Do give it a try."
2,A contraproductive compromise with the facts of history.,"Modern history witnessed nothing like Enver Hoxha's reign of terror over His own people.From His establishment in 1945,Albania was turned into Gulag,although that is only euphemism for real state of affairs.Untill 1948's Yugoslavia's split with Stalin,His country recevied enormous ammount of help from Belgrade,although it was ally of Axis,but latter He becomed so loyal to Stalin,that He broke-up with U.S.S.R. after Kruschev's turning away from stalinism and embraced Mao's China.So,the idea that Hoxha was pro-independence leaders do not agrees with fact that under His regime,Albania was always attached to ""Big Brother"" kind of country,in a most servile manner.He brought total devastation and unprecedented poverty to Albania-The Land of Million Bunkers.Compared with Albania,Albanians in Yugoslavia lived in California.Yet,Author glorifies Hoxha as some kind of positive figure,as if His policy is recomendable one for todays World."
1,Irresponsable intellectuel game,"This is an odd book in every respect, and it reflects an odd historical phenomenon. Sure it is a fact that Albaina--Russia for that matter--industrialised and remained a soveriegn state throughout a period of terrible dictatorship. But these are simple facts, and not bases for a historical reevaluation of the true character of regimes.This book reflects an attempt by the author to set himself apart by siding with a new historical school, one that I hope and have confidence will be disproven.We owe as much to the twentieth century and the bitter lessons it has taught us, or most of us I should say."
3,Not all that!,"I enjoyed Mr. Carlson's first book, ""The Plague Year"" much more than this, its sequel. The Plague War's characters were less developed and often inconsistent.Relationship transitions seemed to happen out of view with little or no explanation. I think the focus being more on Ruth Goldman and her non-relationship with Cam, than being on Cam, hurt the strength of the story.Characters are introduced and then simply disappear. Not much resolution and the tension was not as gripping."
1,Not as good as the first,"Boy, after a while, I just scanned. Not very well written, or edited. Who edited this and let it out in this condition. Great premise, not enough meat. Very disappointing."
4,"Good read, but too many mistakes","I have been enjoying the series, however, there are far too many editing mistakes. It's very distracting. Mostly, it's two words run together or awkwardly separated in the middle of the page. This happens A LOT in all three books. Perhaps it is the translation of the books into digital form, but someone needs to edit it better. It seems amateurish, and not in line with the quality of the book itself, which is high. I would have given this series 5 stars if I wasn't annoyed. The prose is very good. The author does not repeat words or phrases (a pet peeve of mine) and the action moves along nicely. I have not finished the the last book, so I can't speak to the ending, but if it's anything even somewhat clever and not formulaic, I'll be pleased."
2,Was this really necessary?,"Plague Year was a very interesting techno-survival novel, well written, strong characters, with a satisfying but open ending. How disappointing that he decided to turn this into an endless, derivative post-apocalyptic series.I understand how hard it is to make a living as an author, but Mr. Carlson, please don't plagiarize your own best works. Its a time honored tradition for good authors such as yourself, to have a separate pulp-series for cranking out the next mortgage payment (insert Ursula K. Le Guin joke here)."
3,ok sequel,"ok sequel to plague year. clash of surviving goverments of shattered worldstill reeling from nano virus making all of earth below 10,000 uninhabitable. worth picking up if you enjoyed the 1st. if have'nt read plague year highly recommendeed. one of the craziest, grimmest apocaplysenovels out there"
5,Fantastic comb,"The Combs of T3 give your hair a shiny look and prevent frizz. This comb is also large enough to comb your hair in a sec, I love it!"
3,Vocalise,"Streep, as usual, provides great reading of Rilke's poetry. The music is jazz and vocalise, which is attractive to some. A person who enjoys listening to different styles of music and vocalise might like this work."
5,Very good real life mystery,"Although this is primarily about the author, a successful journalist, searching for the truth behind his grandmother's death in an explosion at a young age, the book also delves deeply into the many ways the white man took advantage of and blatantly stole from the Osage Indians in northeast Oklahoma. At one time, members of this tribe were among the richest individuals in the u.s. their 'headright' was the ticket to that fortune and they could be bought, sold, married for. Murder was also a frequent shortcut taken by the unsavory. Mr. McAuliffe explores the possibility that his mother's father may not have been a grieving widower left with a baby daughter, but a conniving thief after her headright. Living just a stone's throw away from Osage county Oklahoma, I have heard many of these stories, and this personal quest of Mr. McAuliffe's is a spellbinding read about those days."
2,"Good reporting - yet author simplifies his ""minority status""","Although this book brings an excellent historical perspective (of a tragic period in the Osage history) to its readers, the author should have refrained from giving the book a ""Dances With Wolves"" feel when talking about his new-found identity as an Osage Indian. I found it particularly out-of-place when the author says he, ""as a white man"", used (or I believe abused) his piece of Indian heritage to try to get a job. Unfortunately, his tone at the beginning of the book turned me off to the rest (and subsequently best part!!)"
1,Progressive rock revisited,"I indeed recommend this recording, it is a very interesting musical experiment of how groups like Yes could have been if the had turned in a different direction. It is amazing and refreshing."
3,"Great music, miserable ""remaster""","Terrific music, much loved as vinyl, but the sound on this cd is horrible with muffled drums, in fact the entire high end is missing. Sounds as though it was remastered from a worn-out lp with the clicks and pops removed. Proves that ""remastered"" doesn't mean a thing when it comes to audio quality."
5,Wonderful reading!,"Combines the enchantment, the romance and the mystery of Ireland with a touch of humor and whimsey. I've read the book many times and each time it is a joy. This is the story of a young English orphan girl who is sent to Ireland to live with her grandfather. Her trials and triumphs growing up and her friendship with the Bishop of Carrick are all good reading. Add a rich, secret benefactor and you've got yourself a great read!"
3,Good... but not great....,"I'm not one of those people that thinks that Staind sold out... I love Staind and always have. This album is good but not a standout in my opinion. Lately, it seems to me that all of their songs sound just like the others. I don't hear any songs on here that I haven't heard from them before. Don't get me wrong, thy're still great, but sound like the others. I would love to hear something different that would really blow me away. But if you're a fan of Staind, you'll still enjoy this album."
2,Not the Staind I Know,"I've been a fan of Staind since the 1999 days of Dysfunction, and when Break the Cycle was released, I thought that there was nothing these guys could do wrong that would ruin their career. Well I bought 14 Shades of Grey and found it very disappointing. I'm not one to rag on soft music, but Staind is not the band to go more soft than hard. Sure there are some great songs on hear like ""How Bout You"" and ""Yesterday,"" but I can't buy into this cd at all, even after a few listens. Do yourself a favor and go buy Break the Cycle. That's a classic Staind. Hopefully, Staind will realize that they need to get their balls back from the media and stop putting out this weak material."
1,Do Not Buy,"I really tried to like this CD, as I liked Break the Cycle. But this album is impossible to listen to from beginning to end. There are a couple of nice tracks, but it's mostly the same guitar and same vocal phrasing from song to song. It's monotonous and gave me a headache."
1,what the heck happened,"I have been into staind since tormented was released. This is the worste thing I have heard them do. Not because Aaron doesn't scream anymore, his voice is great. But it is the songs themselves, they are very boring. Track after track its the same thing over and over again. I will always praise the name of Staind and the amazing and life changing music they have done. But 14 shades of grey will not be what I am talking about."
1,14 Shades of the Snooze Button,"Does anyone else think 14 Shades of Grey is horribly boring? Is this really the same band that put out Dysfunction? Man, come on people. The problem with 14 Shades of Grey and new metal acts in general is we never see an improvement over the last record, instead we see bands like Staind, Limp Bizquik and the dozens of others putting out a pretty good first album, and then just going straight down the toilet after they get rich. I guess so much for legendary 80s acts that put their blood and sweat into every note, 14 Shades of Grey sounds like someone was half concious when this thing was made."
3,14 songs to long...,"I liked Stainds last CD ""Break The Cycle"" but I have no idea what happened on this one. Alot of the songs are repetitive as some of the reviews said and alot of them are not bad acoustic ballads. Some highlights on this CD are ""How About You"" ""So Far Away"", ""Reality"", ""Layne"" & ""Tonight"". It justs makes me wonder what will be in store for Staind in the future , another yet mellowed down version of ""Break the Cycle"" or another great cd like ""Dysfunction"". I'm being pretty nice to give this cd an average rating. In my opinion this cd is very boring, but experimental, which is good because most new bands have a problem with doing that. I recommend just downloading the cd and burning it, its not worth the buy unless if you are a loyal Staind fan."
5,Best cd i have ever heard.,"This i have to say this is a amazing cd. I have Staind's first realease ""Tormented"", and this is almost 360* from it. ""14 Shades of Grey"" has its low points, but not many. I was really uplifted by Aaron Lewis's tribute to his daughter ""Zoe Jane,"" and I am completly thankful for the tribute ""Layne."" Only Staind and Cold has done this, and both songs drew tears from my eyes. All I hope is that Staind continues to advance in their music and lives in times to come."
5,Best Cd.,"Many miss the hardcoreness in stainds previous albums. But i feel this is an amazeing cd that speaks something everyone can relate to. That goes a million times more for me. I do miss the raw emotion, the screaming, the power, but regardless i LOVE this cd and feel everyone should purchase it. The DVD is awesome, the cd is god like. All and all EVERYONE who is a staind fan or has heard a few of their songs or never had the honor of expericening STAIND, i say to those groups GET THIS CD ASAP.Greg"
5,Staind Pulls it off Again!!,"Staind's new cd, 14 Shades of Gray, is no disappointment, that is, to a true Staind fan. Many say that Staind has ""sold out"", but I can guarantee you that they are 100% wrong. All of the tracks are great. The tunes sound excellent and they're something new, not like any other bands around today. I especially liked this cd because Aaron Lewis (lead vocals) shows his vocal range really well in his songs, especially Zoe Jane. So I give this cd a five. It's their best yet, what more is there to say? So if you dont have it yet, buy it!! It's worth every penny!"
1,"Slow, repetative, DISSAPOINTING!","Unlike the great Junior effort of Cold, Staind's new CD falls short of every expectation I had. I am an ""old school"" Staind fan and I'm sick of everyone saying that the third Staind album is coming out. It's the fourth album and the worst. There are no memorable guitar riffs, no angry, brutal lyrics, just a CD filled with talking about how good life is. It's great that Aaron is happy now, but with the happiness comes a type of music that speaks to MTV TRLers instead of people who enjoyed Tormented and Dysfunction. The riffs and lyrics are repetative and at times may drive the listener insane. I suggest buying the new Deftones or Cold album, because they still have ""it."" It's too bad my favorite band has lost ""it."""
2,Ultimately Forgetable,"Ugh. When a group wants to experiment, they sometimes make a breakthrough such as the Beatles' White Album. However, the only similarity between this tripe and the White Album is a monochromatic cover.This is a lackluster poor excuse for a follow up to their previous albums. The music is bland, uninteresting and ultimately forgetable.I've only listened to this CD twice. I've listened to Meteora much more.Now let's see how P.O.D. ruins themselves next."
1,Stop the whining!!!,"...This is one of the most whiny, boring albums I've ever heard. I thought Billy Corgan was a whiner but this sad sack takes the cake. No more whining about mommy/daddy issues! Enough already!"
2,Cashin in,"14 Shades of Grey is Staind's way of trying to obtain more pop success. What happened to more the heavier(but not too heavy) rock songs that I enjoy. Break the Cycle had these type of songs(ex. Fade and For You). When I bought this CD I was expecting more songs like this, but instead you get more melodic songs like ""how About You"" and ""Fray."" Staind's success that they had with ""Its Been a While"", ""Outside"", and ""Epiphany"" had obviously gone to their head and they decided to make practically a whole cd of these types of songs. Maybe this is just a progressive trend to a more melodic tone, but I'm sure it seems to many of people that they are just looking to cash in. What happened to more rock tone that they had with ""Mudshovel"" and ""Suffer?"" This is the type of sound I expected with 14 Shades of Grey. If Staind keeps going in this direction with their next album they can not expect me to come along with them."
3,The begining of the end,Aaron please dont sellout like fred durst dont waste your talent and dont listen to fred on his lessons of sellin out.your next album better be like dysfunction. drop fred and flip produce your own agresive fury rock you once had...
2,I expected that!,"If anyone has read my review on Break the Cycle would probably know that my opinion about Staind is extremely negative. Anyway, as I expected, this album offers nothing new. The tunes are too predictable: Every time while listening to any of the songs you feel what the next note or chord are going to be. Staind's musical visions are too limited, they show no creativity on this project, only humming the same tunes over and over again.I was very passionate when reviewing Break the Cycle because I felt its success as great injustice. Now, I am calmer since I can see that this album's going to put the band where they belong. That means: out of the charts for good!"
2,No matter what you say they sold out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Take it from a huge Staind fan.I'm not saying they sold out because they have softer songs now, I'm saying they sold out because this album is pretty much exactly like Break the Cycle. Don't get me wrong, I like this album, but Staind hasn't really evolved since their last album.Take Tormented, for example. It has tons of awesome,heavy songs but the songwriting and production aren't the best. Then came Dysfunction. It had great, heavy songs, the songwriting was great and the production kicked. Then Break the Cycle. The songs were softer, but it had some of the best songwriting ever! Now with 14 shades of Grey, Staind repeated what made Break the Cycle so great, making at best a mediocre album. The only tracks that stood out for me were ""Layne"" a tribute to AIC singer Layne Staley. And the single ""Price to Play"". Download if you have the time. The only thing really cool about this is the DVD."
4,Going Strong,"With this album I was somewhat expecting to be let down. But after hearing the first single from the album ""Price to Play"" I knew that this wouldn't be the case. On this album the band puts out a fuller sound as compared to previous outings. It seems the guitar riffs were more thought out without compromising the bands signature sound. With each song singer aaron lewis gives us a better glimpse into how he feels, and makes you feel it with him. I think this cd is one of the top 5 that will come out this year."
4,Departure,"I rushed out and got this disc the day it was released, put it in my player and waited for it to rock out like Dysfunction or Break The Cycle. I'm still waiting. This is not to say that this is a bad CD; it's not. In fact, the songwriting has matured and the band sounds as tight as ever. It just doesn't have that old familiar crunch that I've come to love. It seems as if Aaron & company have found their niche with the slower power-ballad sort of songs in the vein of It's Been Awhile and Fade that have brought them the greatest success, and have decided to run with it. This has yielded a set of very good songs such as Yesterday, Intro, and of course Price To Play. Once I got past my initial set of expectations, this CD has really started to grow on me. The bonus DVD is also a valuable addition. A very solid offering from a great band."
1,What?,"Every member of Staind (Fred Durst helped them out there) should be shot. Their fans should be shot to, it's fine if they hate their parents for feeding them and giving them a home and putting up with their whiny ass all their life, but do we really need a guy that's an adult sining about it? How about his desire to kill himself and it's all his parents fault? oh boo hoo grow up kids."
2,STAIND sucks,"Just when I expect Staind to have advanced beyond the level of regurgitated death metal riffs, they turn around and write a pop album. While they try to capture the best elements of an easy-going top 40 album and a hard rock death metal album, it's really just pop when you turn the rock over to see what's underneath. I always thought if Aaron Lewis wanted to be a psychiatrist, just quit the music business and get his Master's degree, because all his lyrics are about are his gripes and moans about his lost childhood. It reminds of a therapy session. I don't want to be reminded of therapy when I listen to your music."
3,Not bad,"First, I'd just like to say it seems like Staind got the idea for the title from a far superior band by the name of Cold (13 Ways to Bleed On Stage, 14 Shades of Grey...hmm...). Anyway, this is a pretty good CD, especially ""Price to Play"", ""Fray"", and ""Fill Me Up"". ""So Far Away"" used to be a good song until the radio raped it for all it was worth. Staind's debut CD and Break the Cycle were both much better. However, I would recommend anything by Cold before anything by Staind. Staind have gone soft, pure and simple."
3,If it wasn't Staind I would have given it a 2!,"May 20th, 2003...the day Staind died. I bought this CD on release day. I thought maybe the record company packaged a collection of songs from Hugh Grant movies in a Staind case by mistake. At some point most of the songs on this CD have undistorted or acoustic guitar. Acoustic is great here and there, but this CD is really hard to swallow since it is from from a great metal act like Staind. If anyone is familiar with their Indie release ""Tormented"" they will wonder what happened to this band. I thought ""Break the Cycle"" was a decent CD, but a far cry from ""Dysfuctional"" and even further cry from ""Tormented"". This CD makes ""Break the Cycle"" look like a Pantera album. Let's hope Aaron Bon Jovi, I mean Lewis, and the rest of the band come back some day. If you want a CD that will make you want to get in the pit, grab the new Deftones release."
4,"Some very good songs, very long and slow","I want to clear up a few things* Aaron Lewis is not known for his deep baritone voice* So Far Away is not about someone you love that is far away* How About You is a better song anyway* Fray goes on way too long* Falling Down, along with Price to Play and How About You, are the best songs on this CD* The bridges on the songs are cliched and the repetition is tiresome* At least three songs use the Eb-B-(Db)-Eb chord progression for verses* Song #12 seems like it's built out of pieces of other songs from the same very album* Staind rocks when they are heavy and they rock live"
5,14 Shades of Grey,"I just love this new album!!! When I heard, Price to Play, I new I had to get this Staind album, too. Plus, they were my favorite band before this album! Now I have the CD and I'm constently playing it."
1,very disappointed,price to pay is the only song on there that was any good.every song sounds basically the same.not the staind i know and love.
4,Not as good as previous Staind albums but still good,"OK, so it's not the typical Staind that we've grown to love, but I still really enjoy listening to this album. They are exploring a new facet in their musical tastes. Zoe Jane is an awesome song, and I give props to Aaron for pulling it off. Like all fans, I look forward to hearing the next album, hoping for some harder material, but until then, I am satisfied listening to this album along with their older ones."
1,Ugh....,"When will Aaron Lewis stop coming down? Jesus Christ, I wish I got millions of dollars because my parents got divorced, then I could be like Aaron Lewis. First I would have to cry into a microphone about it though, then I get the million dollars."
3,"Good in a way, bad in a way.","The growth of Aaron Lewis from Disfunction to Break the Cycle was amazing, and was what made their 2nd CD work for me. The lyrics were touching and beautiful, and the band still had their edge from their Disfuction days. I enjoyed the more 'ballad' type songs off of Break the Cycle, but on 14, that's...well, all there is. Don't get me wrong, the songs are all right, but they seemed to have forgotten that they're a metal band, and they need to be hard-hitting and heavy. It would have been nice to hear some music harkening back to their Disfunction days, but unfortunatly it's not here.I recomend the CD to anyone who is a hard-core Staind fan, or someone who really enjoys their ballad-type songs. If you're looking for fight music or something to get pumped up to, then avoid this."
5,emotional,"after the first single, ""Price to Play,"" i thought that this cd was going to be like the two previous. so of course i was going to by it, but after listening to it all the way through, i realized that this is a very different staind. but the more i listen to it, the more i absolutely love it. this is one of the best albums i've heard in a long time. but if you're looking for the old staind, don't look here. if you love lewis's voice, then this is definently the album for you. he is unbelievable, and the music is great too."
4,14 Shades of Grey,"14 Shades of Grey is a great CD. Although the last three CDs had a mixture of heaviness and some mellow feeling to it, some people will be disappointed with the CD. It has a more mature mellow feeling songs, but in my opinion it shows how much Aaron and the band has grown up and how they are finally happy with their life and their healing process.Although I think there are too many mellow feeling songs on the CD, I still enjoy them and the lyrics are truly amazing.The DVD is fun to watch. Episodes from their personal life and life on the road with concerts gives us fans, a chance to see what they are really like and they are willingly and openly to share with the fans, which is rare to find in many bands and artists today.All in all the DVD is fun to watch and the CD is something great to relax to."
5,Another Kick ....CD From Staind,"well...they did it once again with their new CD 14 Shades of Gray. The minute that I heard the song ""Price to Pay"" I knew that this cd would be an instant hit. The name 14 shardes goes great with this cd, 14 shades for 14 songs with a all different chorus. If you don't have this cd I highly suggest that you get it today, it will be the best cd that you have purchased in months."
2,Very Disappointed,"Staind's newest release starts of very promising (Price to Play)and then goes downhill very very fast. I guess they figured out the commercial sappy droning ballad that gave them commercial success. What happened to the great hard riffs (A Flat, Spleen, Crawl, Pressure, etc.) If you like Staind for the hard rock they can play then save your money because this album just drones on and on from one sappy ballad to another. Do yourself a favor and by Anthrax - WCFYA to see how hard rock should be done. Staind = Very Disappointed."
1,14 Shades of [Bad],"If your hoping to hear the Staind of old...you wont hear it on 14 Shades of Grey..A friend bought it today,and let me listen to it.I was looking foward to buying it myself,but after hearing it,I wont be wasting my money on it.It is more commercial sounding than thier last album.I couldnt even finish listening to it...buy the new Powerman 5000 cd instead,they may not sound like they're old stuff either,but at least THEY still ROCK!"
1,14 Shades of Gay,"That's what the cd should have been called. This cd is so [bad]and a total dissappointment. I know, that's my opinion. But if you're expecting anything like Mudshovel from Dysfunction or anything off of Break The Cycle, you'll be totally let down. Now I bought it on reputation. I gave it a listen twice, well I tried twice. I couldn't get through it the second time. I have been defending them since the Cycle came out to all my buddies, but no more. This is [awful]....They are all wimpy. I'm sure the radio will push some song, but that's when I'll switch the station. I'll stick with Chevelle, Flaw, From Zero and 40 Below Summer. They rock, Staind sucks. It gets no stars."
2,"When rockers are happy, the music suffers","I've read a few of the reviews on this album and I agree with anyone's assesment that happiness is not something to play or write heavy metal music to. Dysfunction was a great album and I still enjoy listening even after several years of listening to it. But this fru-fru lovey dovey album is just not them! Hey guys, stick to one formula. Developing your music is fine but this radical change to ""hey, I feel great, and you should too!"" is just no good. Buy Dysfunction, listen to someone's copy of Break the Cycle, and leave this at the store. You'll be happier in the long run."
1,Same strings and chorus over and over again,Staind came to limelight with the overhyped Break the cycle. Althougth the former had some good and catchy songs this new album is the same stuff over and over again. Same singing style and chorus that goes for 13 songs. Staind is not crative but just trying the same strings. This is the bad one. Stay away.
1,Boring.,"I never liked staind because they always bored me and continue to do so...All the songs are realy slow and its not heavy at all. I mean, if you enjoy mtv music then you'll fall in love with staind's "" 14 shades of grey"" but other wise? Don't buy it."
3,|3| A more-or-less forgettable album with a few great tracks,"I am not a Staind fan or a fan of anything nu-metal for that matter, but '14 Shades of Grey' simply could have been much better, especailly after hearing standout tracks like ""So Far Away"" and ""Zoe Jane."" The rest of the stuff here is snoozer-material that will probably dissapoint a lot of Staind fans. Expect simplistic, repeated verse and chorus work and a bit of whining here an' there. 'Break the Cycle' was a much better album. Thumbs barely up."
1,14 Shades of ...yawn,"I'll start by saying that I was a big Staind fan before this debacle. Tormented, Dysfunction and Break The Cycle were all very good. Each release building from the one before it.I expected a real masterpiece with this new disc.Well, I didn't get it. In fact, this CD is a great sleep aid.Every song is pretty much the same. Sad verse, sad soaring chorus, sad verse, etc. What happened to the band that actually rocked? The thing I liked about this band was the two sides they represented-the light AND the shade. This is just boring, radio friendly, sit by the window and cry manure. What a disappointment."
3,Could have been better,"I've been a fan of Staind since ""Dysfunction"", and ""Break The Cycle"" was just a wicked disc...still one of my favorites. I've really tried to like their new CD just as much but I can't. While it's not BAD it's just...sorta...dull. It almost sounds like ""Break The Cycle: The Out-Takes"", using the same basic songwriting formula as their last album but missing the great hooks and catchy tunes like ""It's Been A While"", ""Fade"", ""For You"", and...well...pretty much every other song on that album. In summary, this album gets 3 stars from me...2 stars for the two best songs ""Price to Play"" and ""So Far Away"", and one star for the decent tribute attempt to Alice In Chains on ""Layne""."
2,Grey Stains Wash Out!!,"Alot of hype has surrounded this album..which will leave alot of people quite dissapointed. This album just isn't up to par with Tormented, Dysfunction, and Break the Cycle. WHERE ARE THE DEEP LYRICS??? We are used to Staind giving us lyrics that leave us in awe. Lyrics that help us to feel their pain. But lyrically Aaron just doesn't seem to have the passion he had in prior albums. Above all though this is still a descent record. But as a avid Staind fan...I was quite dissapointed. I was expecting more."
1,It makes me sick!,"Ummmmm... Since when was Staind a softcore rock band. They should consider doing a colaberation with Kenny G, they could call it Gettin' Old. I was so pumped about the new staind cd after hearing price to play i went out and bought the cd right away... bad idea. Staind has lost all its cred and gone out and made a CD that i would let my 4 yearold listen to. I miss the staind of old when they were making songs like epiphany and outside. Now, now theyre just making 2 good radio songs and 10 piles of turd. DONT BUY. If your looking for better cds get Colds ""year of the spider"" or Disturbed's ""Believe"", you wont be sorry."
1,Mainstream teeny-boppers rejoice!,"This is possibly the hands-down worst album I have heard all year in 2003. I used to be a huge fan of Staind when Dysfunction came out and I have to say that I love their debut, Tormented, as well. Break the Cycle was alright, and now we have 14 Shades of Grey. This album is so horrible and monotone and every song sounds EXACTLY the same. They are no longer a metal band, with this release they are a soft/pop-rock band with a sound geared towards the 12 year old teeny bopper crowd. Anyone who says this album is even decent obviously has the musical knowledge of said teenyboppers. Listen to Dysfunction or Tormented if you have that one already. Heck, I would rather even listen to recent Korn than this. If I wanted to hear gay music I would just go listen to Creed. Glad I did not pay money for this release."
2,Lost their balls,"Ok. The first 4 songs were good. But the whole album sounds like Nickelback. Where's the balls man? All ballads don't cut it. This is not Metal, or even Rock music."
3,"Not bad, but nothing that grabs you.","I like everything on the ablum, but love nothing. On the two albums before this one there were songs that just grabbed me and became some of my favorite songs. While I like listening to this one, there are no songs I rewind to to hear again.Better than Metallicas new album."
5,Simply amazing and unique,"I thought it would be difficult for Staind to release an album that would top Break the Cycle, but they did it. I just got the CD yesterday and I can't stop listening to it. Every song is amazing. I find myself concentrating on the music one time and the lyrics the next, both are incredible. You can really relate to and feel the emotion in all the songs. Truly inspiring and unique. Just buy it and you'll see."
1,UGH!!,"Once again, Staind continued the fall from what they used to be, which was a pretty damn fine HARD rock band. Now, they are just like everything else out there on the radio. They have managed to throw together 14 sure-fire radio hits, which is exactly what I was hoping they would never do. ""Break the Cycle"" was bad enough, but this takes Staind to a whole new level of blending in. The only thing distinguishing this album from about 100 other radio-friendly rock albums is that Aaron Lewis has one of the better voices in rock today. Unfortunately, that is not enough. If you liked ""Dysfunction"", and sort of enjoyed ""Break the Cycle"", don't buy this, because you will be thoroughly disappointed."
1,let's be real this is crap,"Okay, I used to like this band, back when I was a sophomore in high school, and the only knowledge I had of rock and roll was what they played on the local ""heavy"" rock station. I soon broadened my musical palate, and in doing so discovered how whiny, derivative, uninspired, and trendy Staind is. Their sound is completely boring and washed out. Grey, indeed. Go ahead and click the unhelpful button! Come on, Staind fans, show me how mad you are! Then go listen to Aaron cry about his ""pain."""
1,WHAT HAPPEND???,"What happend to this band? They were good. I am VERY dissapointed with staind's last to records. All of their new songs sound so much alike it's not even funny. I hear songs like ""so far away"" and I start to think of ""it's been a while"" or ""outside"". Staind's best album by far is Dysfunction. This band had been sold out to MTV. How often do you see the video for ""Mudshovel"" or anything else off Dysfunction??? Hardly ever. Why? I don't now, someone please tell me. Anyway, if I had it to do over again, I would not buy the last to CDs. If you have purchased them, use them as coasters for your drinks or as hockey pucks, certainly don't subject your ears to the music that's on them."
1,more useless garbage,"I can think of about 3,000 bands with more talent in their big toe. This is just more whiney (and I mean whaaaaney) garbage music like most of the mainstream junk that's popped up over the last decade. This is one of the most annoying bands I have ever heard. ALL their singles sucked [whaaaaaaaaney]. Quit following the mainstream herd of sheep and find yourself some real music...simple minds for a shallow society."
5,beyond amazing,"Just when I thought Staind couldn't beat Break the Cycle they surprised me. 14 Shades of Grey is so diverse that no matter what style of music you're into there will be a song on this album you're guaranteed to love. The album opens with the albums first single, ""Price to Play"" and ends with ""Intro, a thank you to all the people in Aaron Lewis' life.(in some lyrics frustration with people who didn't care) For those of you who like the ""lighter"" side of Staind there are tracks for you. Songs like ""Zoe Jane"", ""So Far Away"", and ""Fill Me Up"" are sure to catch your attention. But like I said no matter what style you're into you'll love 14 Shades of Grey. It's a must have and I wouldn't dare leave the house without it."
5,"14 Shades is Staind, only matured","I just bought this album a couple of days ago, and I haven't pulled it out of my car's CD player yet! I knew as I listened to the whole album through that more than just a few of their ""fans"" would be disappointed with this album. But a true fan likes and wants a band's music to grow and mature. And that's exactly what Staind has put out here.They still have a driving, passion-filled sound. They have just moved away from anger as being the sole force behind their music. I loved each of their albums for what they were; I love this one because this is Staind, all grown up!"
4,all songs sound similar in this album but good.,"I have just found the most songs in this album sound the same. Still I like it. As I listened to first half part of this album I was very excited but I gradually kinda got bored. I have known Staind from Break the Cycle. I like the vocalist's voice. There are some metal singers with sweet voices as in Creed, Nickelback, and Staind. Somehow I feel more mature than I really am when I am listening to these bands. To me honestly, screeming and shouting are sometimes too abstruct or even too surrealistc to understand like picaso's paintings. Anyways I like the way Staind is now. I like to own this album in my favorite music collection as well."
4,Better than expected,"I'm not a previous Stained fan, but i got the cd, and got more than i expected. I thought the cd would be then screaming and head banging, but instead i got 14 deep lyricical songs that you can really sleep to. If i could, ide give it a 3.5, because most of it sounds the same, but in the long run, ide say its worth buying."
1,I used to love 'em,"But times have changed. When my older brother turned me onto the good bands to come out of the early 90's grunge scene(Soundgarden, Tad and Alice in Chains), I couldn't listen to Staind the way I used to. In fact, I gradually began to realize that most nu metal sucks, even though I myself was a diehard fan.I didn't buy this album, I just shrugged and checked it out at a friend's house. It is a lot less depressing, but also less interesting. Aaron Lewis and his band must have a fair amount of money by now, yet they still complain about how much childhood sucks.Gimme a break."
2,huge dissapointment,"I bought this album expecting another great CD from staind. Man was I dissapointed. I didn't really like ""Price To Play"" when I heard it on the radio but I still expected a great album from Staind. At first listen I didn't like a single song on the album. There were only 2 songs I didn't like on Dysfunction and Break the Cycle combined. After a couple more listens, I realized how great ""So Far Away"" is but still thought the rest of the album was alright but nothing good. It sounds like you're listening to the same song over and over and it's not even good. The plusses are that they gave Layne Staley some respect by writing a song for him and the DVD made it worth the money."
2,I understand bands change but....,"This is definitely not the Staind I fell in love with. I won't go as far as to say they've sold out but now that Aaron has a few million in his pocket, he suddenly runs out of good things to sing about. ""14 Shades of Grey"" was a result of this and is therefore exactly what I have listened to numerous times: Endless, monotonous, unoriginal garbage. I know that bands do change, and I understand. However, I have to say that as Aaron's sadness disappeared, so did his talent. I still have faith in them though."
1,"1 star = smart people, 5 stars = stupid and fooled people","WAKE THE HELL UP!!! This is not metal this is not even rock. Nu-metal is dying and rotting and here's an example like this terrible band. This album was created in a garbage bag. Real rock people toss this CD out of the window and get something like Blind Guardian or Iced Earth or maybe Stratovarius. Staind, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit and others are totl s**t they are like music from your flushed toilet. 14 shades of crap this album should be named. The others break the cycle and dysfuntion are also c**p. Aaron Lweis's voice in not comparable to Hansi Kursch or Bruce Dickenson. I feel pitied to the victims of nu-s**t-metal because media is showing the stupid vesion of it. There no solos there are no creativity in guitars. My 3 yrs old nephew plays this terrible music. STAIND SSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUUXXXXXXXXX."
1,Anoder reazon to fred durst and....,"limp bisquick i mean bizkit. srry thugz. but this peace-o-crap band aint friggin worth even listenin' two dawgs. diss band has a lead singer dat went from HARD to dis prissy im so glad im alive and i love my friggin life. now homies who the heck would like dat kind of muzzzik? tell me. cause after hearing da ""multi platinum"" resultz may vary limp bisquick albulm i mean bizkit it must have been dursts idea to do diss. again if ya this albulm thugz day neva eva would have been here if it werent for freddy durst. peace out thugz."
2,The trend is dead...,"It's only natural that after the success captured with Staind's overrated breakthrough album ""Break the Cycle"" that the band would continue the same formula with their new album ""14 Shades of Grey"". While I find this album not as irritating as their last (to a point), Aaron Lewis' lyrics are cliche and predictable most of the time. The song worth noting however is ""Layne"", the band's tribute to late Alice in Chains frontman Layne Staley, and while the band's good intentions aren't in question, the song seems too rushed, but it's merits have heart. The band as a whole sound much better than they did on ""Break the Cycle"", now and then there are snipets of the musicianship from Staind's original debut ""Tormented"", but musically speaking this is the same old tried and true downtuned guitars and incosistent rhythm section. All in all, ""14 Shades of Grey"" is better than expected, but I'll take the real deal, Alice in Chains, over this any day."
2,Where did Staind go?,Why is it when a band get famous they suddenly think they need to make their next album all artsy fartsy. This is'nt the Staind I know. Price to Play is about the only song somewhat worth listening to.
1,14 shades of fantasic melodies,"14 Shades of Grey is by far the most intiricatly musical album the guys of Staind have put out. While there are the usual heavy signature Staind songs with the power vocals, difficult drum lines, and pounding guitars, there are many more melodic, dare I say ""power ballads"" on this album. The final song, oddly titled, ""Intro,"" can be easily described as a heavier and more powerful ""Epiphany"" from ""Break the Cycle."" Overall, the entire is much more positive and flowing rather than the depressing, anger powered freshman and sophomore relases. 14 Shades of Grey delievers everything a hard core Staind fan wants, and so much more. Every rock fan needs this album!"
2,a good stain in the rock industry,"good CD! not nearly as heavy, no ""sequel"" to cant believe (same yelling style) still a good CD! i reccomend u get it"
2,Why did they even bother making this,"I have been a fan of Staind's since the ""Dysfunction"" days. Then ventured onto Tormented and was eventually hooked. I had hope that they wouldn't go soft, and low and behold, what do they do, they go soft. For those of you that liked the lighter moments of Break The Cycle, this is the album for you. I listened to it the day it came out, I was furious because it was soft, the next day I listened for lyric content. Lyrically, it's a more happier Staind, but nonetheless, it's Staind. I, however, am not a fan of the album, and not sure whether or not to hope the next album will be the real Staind or to just give up. We'll see."
2,Staind has gone soft!,"I purchased this cd with high hopes, especially since I really enjoyed Staind's first two albums. But unfortuantely, they have gone soft in a major way. They have sold out to the MTV lifestyle. The majority of the songs are quite soft, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but they suck too. The vocals are off key and the backgrounds are horrid. The first song on the album is pretty good, but it is all downhill from there. Track three is the worst, I think they sound like a boy band with guitar riffs. Oh well, they used to rock and I will still listen to Dysfunction and enjoy it."
2,Is this Staind?,"I bought this cd being a huge Staind fan. I thought Dysfunctional and Break the Cycle were great, so I'm not a Staind hater. This cd isn't even hard rock. It's more along the lines of Michael Bolton meets Justin Timberlake. Price to Play is the heaviest song on the album and the only song which his scream occurs. Track #6 sounds like a O-Town song. Track #2 sounds emo. Track #3 is happy enough to make any true Staind fan puke. Maybe the sold out, maybe their label has them on a leash, but whatever it is, it's horrible. If you want good pop songs, this is the cd for you. If you want a new Staind cd, don't come here."
1,1 star is too much,All the lead singer is doing is whinn. Go get some therapy and sing better songs. The bands playing is annoying too. No wonder why no one talks about this crappy album. Cause it sucks!
5,awesome,"I thought this was an awesome album. Compared to the rest of them i'd say this is the best yet. If someone can put out 4 albums all of which are amazing, i gotta give em props for it"
2,disapointment,"I bought this cd all excited and psyched after Break The Cycle....and the only thing that resulted in was disapointment and let down. As some people said, Price to Play is the best song by far on this cd, i couldnt get past number 5 on the track list because i was so turned off. if you want a good cd, buy Senses Fail's cd, From the Depth of Dreams."
5,Staind..'Break the cycle' of Nu-Metal Stereotyping...,"This CD rocks! I'm not a fan of this so-called 'Nu-metal', although I never quite thought of Staind as a nu-metal band. Their music is diverse, sometimes dark, sometimes self-pitying, and yes, Aaron Lewis has lived a pretty jaded existence thus far..but havent we all? Every one of their releases keeps getting better and better, and none of the three come out of my CD player. Anyway, although Staind's music deals with alot of heartachy type issues, the music portrayed gives us hope, and light at the end of the tunnel. Music to relate to, and completely f*%king rocks. Keep up the awesome work, guys, and don't ever sell out to commercialism!!"
5,Exceptional,"14 Shades of Grey is great; classic Staind sound, although more lyrical. They seem to get better with every CD they release. The DVD that comes with the CD shows a good deal of behind the scenes. Overall, I highly recommend the 14 Shades of Grey!"
4,Don't expect the old Staind.,"edit: I have been embracing the new Staind. My previous review was too harsh. I am enjoying this album more and more everyday. Do Not Buy this album if you are expecting another Break the Cycle. This is a different Staind. Not nessisarily a bad incarnation (what I originally thought). A couple of the songs (Intro and the song before) I still find unlistenable. However, How About You and Yesterday are amazing tracks. This album is definately a grower. It was tough warming up to the new Staind. But I think that I have done it. I have a new respect for the new sound."
3,What happened?,"i bought this cd after being extremely happy w/ ""Break the Cycle"". this isn't quite what i'd expected. i gave this cd 3 stars only because i respect the musicianship and time spent making these songs and the album. but i don't know if most of the songs on it would even get 2. a few songs do stand out like ""price to play"", ""zoe jane"", etc. but the rest kinda don't match up w/ the Staind that i heard on previous albums. it seems like frontman Lewis has screamed and sung away all the anger that was present on the other hits and now decides to write depressing ballads and slow songs that play at being hardcore. if u're a HUGE Staind fan, buy it. if your a casual listener, don't."
2,Not as Good as I Hoped,"I don't really mind the change that Staind has made in there music. I like some of the new stuff they have out, but after listening to the whole cd I can't say that it is that great of an album. The beginning of the cd is good, till about song six or seven, then its down hill from there. I don't know what happend, they just couldn't finish the good cd they started."
4,"Fan will be divided, that's for sure...","To keep this review short and to the point, people who have heard ""Price to Play"", and rushed to get the album thinking that it would have the same general sound as tthe single, will most likely be disappointed. In my case, I was disappointed, then I kept listening for a while and the album sort of grew on me.Sort of.It's definately a different, softer, possibly happier Staind, that's for sure. Not much yelling/screaming (unfortunately) but the band as a whole have gotten better musically.Some few standout songs include ""Could it Be"", ""Layne"", ""Price to Play"", ""Tonight"" and ""Zoe Jane"". I'm sure you can find out what they all mean from other reviews.So, to summarize it. As a Staind fan, you'll either love it (unlikely) or hate it (probably), or you might like a few songs and dislike most of the album (me). That's cause a disturbing portion of the album all sounds similar...Oh well, here's to hoping we get a harder album the next time around."
4,Good CD,"Staind's second best album. Some songs are real good, but a lot sound the same.1. Price to Play 9/102. How About You 7/103. So Far Away 9/104. Yesterday 8/105. Fray 9/106. Zoe Jane 6/107. Fill Me Up 7/108. Layne 5/109. Falling Down 5/1010.Reality 7/1011.Tonight 5/1012.Could It Be 5/1013.Blow Away 5/1014.Intro 5/10"
2,This is Staind?,"I don't believe I've ever seen a band go progressivly downhill since their first cd... Dysfunction was by far a great cd. Break the cycle wasnt too bad, but a little soft. 14 Shades of Grey is a contstant reminder that bands like to sell out to try and make more money. My opinion? if you like older staind you're going to hate this cd. If you go for more touchy feely music, you're gonna love it"
1,Ths has to Stop,"This is not rock music nor metal , no creativity , no real musicianship and th same stale recyled lyrics - in a word Nu-Metal , and this music must go away Be part of the solution and DON'T buy this album ."
3,"Gets 3 stars for ""So Far Away""","The only reason I can even fathom buying this album is because of the song ""So Far Away"" and maybe ""Layne"". Really- So Far Away is really really good. Musically it's great, lyrically it's great, and the video is good too. Excellent job on that song. Now for the rest of the CD- I can't stand it. Honestly, I just can't listen to it. And if you're looking for more songs on this album like ""Price to Play""- there aren't. I think this is false advertising. Their singles sound nothing like the rest of the album. And the rest of the album just ain't good. Go get Break the Cycle instead."
3,There First Cd is way better,On this Album the first 7 songs are good and the other 7 suck.I think U should get there first cd Break the Cycle it's there best cd.Because i Liked all of the songs on the Break the Cycle Album.The First seven songs on 14 shades of Grey are alright they could have been better I still liked them though.It's not a cd you wan't to listen to over and over.I should have gave them 2 stars because the dissapointment i had but i like them and i think there a good band.
3,Wow....what a disappointment,"I had heard that the new Staind album was going to be a little more mellow, but wow, I did not expect this. Gone are the angry vocals and grinding guitars that made them popular with Dysfunction and Break the Cycle. This album is chock full of ""life is good"" songs that make you want to choke. I give this cd 3 stars just for the superb guitar, drum, and bass work. I like Aaron Lewis' voice, but don't abandon what made you famous....the angry, hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-depressed-bald-guy voice. It sort of makes me angry that they included Pay to Play, the only song that rocks on such a mellow cd. It is as if they wanted us to hear that song on the radio and buy the cd expecting old Staind....I guess that makes me the fool then."
1,Horrible,"This cd let me down so much. I havent really like staind since break the cycle but I thought Disfunction and Tormented were amazing so I always give them a chance. I figured maybe staind had gone back to the more heavier songs but nope. It also seems like a lot of the songs on here sound alike. If you ask me DO NOT buy this cd, total waste of money."
1,Awful.......................Awful!!!!!,"I've read all these reviews about people saying how Staind sold out or how Staind didn't progress with their music. I mean what the hell did you expect? Did you think Staind was gonna bust out some crazy mathcore album full of complex riffs and time changes? It's Satind, they're a Fred Durst band and that's all that should have to be said to get the point across. But unfortunately some 16 yr. old kid in Alabama wearing an ICP shirt who hates his adoring parents doesn't get it. Then I also see people writing about how Aaron Lewis really helped them through some tough times. HOW?!?!? SO basically he's proven that no matter what you do, no matter if your living out your dream life still sucks. I'm sorry this band sucks and so does anyone who supports it. You people have no idea what catostrophic damage this band is doing to the future of music."
3,This isnt so good,"Staind cd is ameatur compared to there other ones. The melody sounds the same for all the songs and it isnt good. I dont recommend it. Some people may say im being unfair, but i am being real. This cd isnt good and i wouldnt waste my money on it."
3,Eh ...,"The only GREAT song on this CD is So Far Away, other than that, this CD is just another rock album. Nothing special here, Staind's Aaron Lewis isn't exactly the best vocalist and their music isn't as catchy as it could be. I'm not going to say anything about their song writing ability because it's actually pretty damn good. I think Staind needs a little work but this album isn't horrible but it's not very good either."
5,A True Staind Fan!!,"First of all, it really pisses me off when supposedly true fans of Staind start dissing this album saying that Staind went soft. Actually I think this is Staind's hardest album yet, just listen to the lyrics and how powerful they are. Aaron Lewis leaves his lyrics imprinted into your head forever, one of the greatest voices and innovative writer of our time backed up by an unbelievable group of talented musicians. This album shows so much maturity and growth in their music. 14 Shades Of Grey redefines rock and gives me even more reason to love them as a band."
5,...Cd 'Staind 14 Shades of Grey',"...I don't just love it because it is staind, I love it because, I feel like I can relate to the lyrics that Aaron Lewis (lead vocals) writes. All the songs kick ... ecspecialy track #6 ""Zoe Jane"", the song that he (Aaron) wrote for his daughter Zoe. You should go out and buy the album!!! I'm not the only one who thinks so...there are alot of us (Staind fans) who think that you should go out and buy a cd with some good music on it. Thank You and goo out and buy 'Staind- 14 Shade Of Grey.' Go check it out!!!!!!! Tell them that Kassie sent ya!!"
3,"the feel of silence (health,society,and policy","I found this book to be upsetting and depressing. All of her life, it seems the author never accepted the fact that she was deaf and tried ""passing"" as hearing for her entire life! Although I am not deaf and do not pretend to know what it is like to be deaf, I felt that she made her life so much more of a struggle by shunning the Deaf Community. She refused to sign and tried to live as a hearing person. This book left me with a feeling of overwhelming sadness for all that this woman has missed in her life as a result of not accepting her deafness and at least trying to be a part of both the hearing and the deaf communities."
1,bad form,"This CD shows little of the power and soul we have come to expect from Ernestine. The glowing rewiew notwithstanding, there are far better outings in the EA catalogue. Check them out instead."
1,WALK AWAY,"This is one of the few movies I didn't finish watching. After 45+ minutes into it, I lost interest and didn't care where it was headed. The 3 leads were mediocre actors and not especially likeable. It might have gotten better but I couldn't stay with it."
2,Blümchen's first english song,"She did a Song in English so you guys can also understand the meaningless things she has to say. And this song is the most meaningless she ever did. But her voice sounds much stronger.This is not a typical Blümchen-song. There are many backgroungsingers and more lyrics.there are three Songs on this Single. The radio Version, the Extended version and the Song ""Where hearts have wings"".It's the english version of her Song ""Herzen haben Flügel"". I think it's on the Blossom-Album ""Heartbeat"""
2,Poor quality and finish,"For the price that these stairs are you would expect a furniture grade product. These are so poorly made and bad quality it's not even funny. The wood has dings, nicks and cracks and has been sprayed with a 'cherry finish' to hide the poor quality. You have to assemble them which is fine if the pieces fit together properly but the joints are lose and flop around. The stairs come with a bunch of glue that you are supposed to used to 'weld' the stairs together and keep them from collapsing. This is one of the worst products I've bought in a long time and I can't wait to send them back to Amazon!"
3,I recommend this item.,"These steps are beautiful. They look like a piece of furniture. They arrive unassembled, but are easy to put together."
2,To small for my 50 pound Border Collie mix,"The steps are to small and close together for my 14 year old Border Collie mix. He was unable to use the steps, and for a 14 year old dog he is in very good shape. It really wasn't getting on the bed but jumping off that concerned me the most.While trying to get Casey to use the steps I had an idea. I put an old ottoman at the foot of my bed, its about 16 inches high, half the distance to the top of the bed. Now Casey can easly get on and off the bed using the ottoman. I could have saved myself some $$$."
3,Perfectly fine for what it is,The steps look like they do in the photo and were very easy to assemble. They have enough weight to them so they don't move when the dog is on the stairs. Too bad my dog does not like them - he won't use them for the world.
3,"An Informative But Disappointing Addition to ""Counterpoints""","While we would certainly recommend this volume to those studying the issue, overall we found it disappointing. There is certainly a great deal of excellent scholarly material to be found -- perhaps far too much to be helpful to the average reader, though. The Editors lead you to believe that unless one has done post-graduate work in New Testament studies, one could not begin to understand the complexities of this issue.(Really?! Me thinks I smell a rat...)Moreover, I found the book to be far too prejudicial against traditional views. (For example, the ""complimentarian"" view is almost always referred to as the ""hierarchical"" view by both editors and the ""egalitarian"" proponents.) Our advice: read Alexander Strauch's book! While there is useful information here, Beck & Bloomberg have ultimately added more confusion to the issue. Recommended -- with qualification."
2,Smaller than expected,"A quality pitcher, but smaller than we expected. You know when you make orange juice it usually fills half a pitcher? It fills this pitcher all the way. I'm sure there's a demand for that size, and the product description probably tells the quantity it will hold so my bad for not noticing - but you need to know to make sure this size will work for you."
5,awesome,"my friend shawn is in the band.. and he gave me a promo copy of this album several months ago, and i havent stopped listening to it since. i used to work in a shop where i was allowed to play my own music.. and i played this album alot, and people who came in kept asking me who this band was and where they could buy the album. its just amazing.. i would recommend this album to anyone. especially anyone into shoegazery/brit pop/rock."
1,The Dubliners 40 years,"This disc was anticipated to be one of their best,,,however, it was spoiled by a lousy recording,,,the disc skips and hesitates and totally ruined the experience..."
3,Nice,"brand new like it says, nonething much to say other then its perfect for starting players and its still in its original seal."
5,The Greatest Cards Ever,I love it!! It's the best thing ever in the world!! I would love another deck.
1,Misleading picture,I was disappointed when I received the package and only found a single towel ring. The picture shows the whole set. I think the picture is misleading and should be updated.
5,Excellent & price efficient!,"Don't waste money on the more expensive cables, this is the exact same thing just a lot cheaper. Works just like the others!"
4,"works great, except in an xbox360","this cable worked great with most of my audio components. I would have rated it 5 stars, but i dinged it 1 star due to the fact that this cable will NOT fit in the optical output of my xbox360 (please note that i have the xbox360 premium version with the component outputs, not the hdmi output).the connection of the cable appeared to be too short to ""snap"" into the optical output of my 360. this cable will not be able to stay in place--im not even sure if it's making a connection with the output.in any case, this cable worked for everything else.if you're planning on buying this specifically for use in an xbox360, i would suggest you look elsewhere, but otherwise, it works great."
5,It works :),"Well, it does get the signal from one end to another and that's all you really need in digital world. The rest is on your components.This one is cheap and works exactly the same as any other optical cable would (not better, not worse - EXACTLY the same)...so, why would you pay more?"
5,up to spec is all that matters,I'd like to add this reassurance for anyone nervous about spending less than a tenth as much for the EXACT SAME thing as the expensive name brands. There is never any reason to pay more than $20 for a six-foot digital cable.
3,Chincy Cable,"I guess you get what you pay for. The price was cheap and the cable was pretty cheap as well. I will do what you need it to, but the quality of the cable is pretty chincy. Be careful, because if you are not careful, the cable will break very easily."
1,"Incredibly Low Quality, Unusable","I figured for $2, it's hard to go wrong. That's still true, but I wasted my $2 on this cable. The connectors on both sides were incredibly cheap and did not snap into the receptacles properly. Wiggling the connector would regain/drop the connection and the connection would intermittently drop when untouched. Had to replace the cable after less than a few hours of use with something a little higher quality. Save your $2 and buy something at least a little nicer..."
5,fiber cable,"was easy to order,install cable work perfect,was deliver on time,price was right. very happy with product. thanks this ie very stupid way to answer about a cable"
4,good for the price,$26 vs $2 this does the exact same thing that my higher priced cable does at a fraction of the cost it may be a bit thinner but it is not ever going to moved around so it will work for what i need it for.
5,Now I can use my...,Bose audio equipment with my Toshiba television. It get the highest quality from sound now and I really appreciate this product.
1,Wrong Item sent - No Response,"I was also sent the wrong cable (Toslink to Mini-Toslink) by mistake. I emailed the seller to correct the mistake, but I did not receive a response. This was very misleading, as the product description and the posted picture lead you to believe you were purchasing a Toslink to Toslink cable."
1,"Junk, absolute junk","First of all, the cable pictured isn't even the cable you receive. I liked how the plastic protector was linked to the cable. Well, the one I got did not have that. The cable itself is the most fragile looking piece of fiber optic, but I guess that's to be expected from such a cheap piece of junk.Now, I bought this cable to link my xbox 360 to my receiver. But the end of the connector has a lip that prevents it from even locking into the socket. So it's basically worthless without a little modification. Anyway, this cable sucks so bad. I don't even think it's worth the cheap price I payed."
1,"Great price, but connectors won't fit","A TOSLink cable for cheap with prime shipping, that sounded promising.Some people complained the connectors are too loose, I seem to have the reverse issue: the connectors won't fit, either on the Panasonic TV or in the expensive audio receiver.I tried an old Sony TOSLink cable and it snaps in just fine (it's unfortunately too short for my setup), so it's not the TV or the receiver. By looking carefully, I see that this cable's connectors are just half a millimeter wider on one side than the Sony's.And yes I removed the little rubber protections on both ends of the cable ;-)Well let's see if theAmazonBasics Toslink Cableconnectors fit correctly. (Update: just received it; it fits perfectly. The connectors snap in place with no effort and are not loose.)"
1,Did not fit.,"It fit into my TV and that's it. It didn't snap into my xbox, ps3, or media center. Waste of money. Amazon Basics cable worked much better."
4,"Looks Cheap, Works Fine","It looks really cheap, not a lot of insulation, but mine snapped in and worked fine. Remember to take the protective caps off!!"
4,Excellent,"I have this cable for a month, and it the sound is excellent. I paid 10% of the price for a similar product in a retail store.I would recommend it to anyone needing an to slink cable."
5,"Clean, Clear, digital.","If you have ever heard or used digital audio before, you know the quality of sound that comes out of these devices. If you have a device that supports this cable (not only something like a blu-ray player but a surround sound system also) then it is a no brIner to get one of these cables. I recently had the sad loss of my old optical cable I bought 2 years ago, it was a ""top of the line belkin or something that I remember was very expensive, but this cable was about 1/32 of the cost and works just as well ifnot better. That being said, if your devices support HDMI audio in, do not hesitate to use that because I have heard the difference, and although subtle, HDMI sound supports surround sound slighty better, but also it all goes through one cable thus saving you clutter and money. Do yourself a favor and get this cable!"
4,it Works,"great cable, really cheap, does the job beautifully. because it's digital, you dont have to worry about getting the signal across since it's cheap - it works perfectly.i agree with other reviewers, the one end doesnt 'click' in firmly like the other end; its a bit loose. Not a problem, since it stays in place. if you's not moving it around everyday, then it is the perfect accessory for your digital needs. definately reccomend it if kept relatively stationary."
1,connector flaw,The connectors do not lock into place and will fall out with the weight of the cord alone. I would give this product 5 stars just for the price if it worked.
2,The Real Deal,"Well i ordered this even after reading some of the negative reviews that stated the prongs (connection at the end) was too short. Well I had a little problem, i originally had a Fiber Optic cable that i was using for my Xbox360, but it was bent really bad near the end of the cable. So if it was moved and landed in the wrong position there would be no sound. I figured since this new cable i bought fit into the Western Digital HD TV Media Player it would fit into my receiver...not the case. It didnt even fit into the Xbox360.The problem is not that it doesnt fit, or that the end is too short, the problem is the teeth that hold it into place are not big enough. It just doesnt hold in its position, making it pretty much worthless.Just pay a little extra for a quality plug, Hope this review helped."
5,Works perfect for me.,I connected my Panasonic TH-50PX60U to my Onkyo TX-SR504 with this cable. I also connected my Onkyo and my Sony DVD player. Works great!
4,Outstanding clarity,"This cable is so good, it puts the limiting factor back into my Infinity speakers. The clarity is truly something to hear."
5,Great cables!,"I purchased these for my Creative Labs USB SoundBlaster Live! 24-Bit External Sound Card and Logitech Z-5450 Digital 5.1 Speaker System. The sound quality is great and better than the standard connection (1/4"" analog cables). The company Parts Express has a lot of other items as well that are fairly priced , so stock up if you need more than just one cable it is well worth it. You will not be dissappointed."
1,Worthless,"The cable doesn't stay in the slot. I couldn't even get it to work. It fit fine into the receiver but just fell out of the Blue-Ray. The end wasn't long enough to even make a connection. If you are using with a blue ray, don't buy it. It's not worth shipping back."
5,$24 cables? Whatchu talkin bout Willis?,I had already bought a $24 optical cable from Radioshack and as soon as I read all these reviews I ordered this one. As soon as it came I swapped out the cable with no noticeable difference except the $20 credit to my AMEX for returning that expensive sucka back to Radioshack. Crooks!
4,Works.,Simple. Works. never used one of these cable before not sure how thick they normally are but this one feels fragile but once you plug in a cable how often does it get missed with? Took a little longer to ship than I'm used to (Prime member). but still within promised time.
5,audio cable,We received this in 2 days after ordering. I plugged it in and now our TV works with our surround sound. Cheap investment for around $2.
1,You get what you pay for,"This product worked for literally a minute. It then stopped working. I checked in on different electronics, and the result was the same. The product was cheap so it isn't a bog loss at all, but it is a pain to be forced to buy a new cable now."
3,3D Not Ready for Full Time Viewing,"With good program quality the 3D effect is very good. However, it is like viewing television through dark sunglasses so if the program content is dark the picture quality is poor. A film like ""Up"" is good but the ""Dark Knight"" isn't. Where 3D really shines is sports like the NBA playoffs. However, this is a relitively cheap price for an emerging technology that will someday be more than high tech toy."
2,Didn't know what it was for..,"I was purchasing things for my new camera and thought this went with it...under the section: people bought ""this and this"" with the product you are purchasing. I assumed that it was something I needed. Thank goodness it was inexpensive..I still have no clue what it's for."
4,Great deal,Purchased one of these from seller Eforcity for less than five bucks after shipping. Arrived pretty quickly in Washington apparently from California. Was in a sealed generic clear plastic bag. Looks just like the one pictured with the clear plastic end connector tethered to the cable. Hooked it up to my Toshiba 1080p TV and Onkyo 7.1 Receiver and it seems to work fine.
4,definitely not fancy,if you are looking for a cable that get the job done and you don't care about how plain the outside looks this is the cable for you
1,pcd basics,these cables are junk.if you buy after reading this review then you do so at your own risk.they are super thin cables.barely pull on them and they will break.DONT BUY THESE BUY THE AMAZON BASICS FIBER OPTIC CABLES THEY ARE 20 TIMES WHAT THESE ARE FOR MAYBE 3-5 DOLLARS MORE.trust me these are not worth the time to click on add to cart.
1,WONT WORK!!!,CONNECTORS WILL NOT STAY ON SOCKETS. I EVEN TRIED TOADJUST THE PLASTIC ON THE CONECTORS NOT WILL NOT WORKIN EITHER END (sony home theater or toshiba tv)I ALSO TRIED ANOTHER CABLE TOSHLINK FROM A DIFFERENTVENDOR DID NOT STAY ON SOCKETS EITHER. AND SURELLYTHERE IS ONLY ONE WAY THEY GO IN YOU'LL EXPECT THECONNECTOR WILL JUST CLICK INTO THE SOCKET BUT NO NOT MATTER WHAT YOU DO.GUESS THAT THE COMPANIES MAKING THIS CABLES HAVE TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER!! IT APPEARS SOME CABLES WILL WORK AND OTHERS SAME MODEL WILL NOT
5,Why pay more when you don't receive any more?,"More and more today you see people saying that overpriced cables are overrated. These people would in fact be telling noting but the truth. While many of us know that a higher price point does not necessarily equal higher quality, there are still those out there who may believe just that. When you buy a cable from a company such as Monster, you pay a premium for their name, nothing more. Spread the word my friends, this cable (as well as others) are just as good, if not better, than any overpriced item found in stores."
1,Not the one in the picture,"OK, First of all I have to say that even though many people say that it does the job (which it does) it is extremely unacceptable to put a picture of a product and to sell another. That being said, I agree that the product did the job, but I had to do some work on one of the sides of the cable because it does not have the correct adapter.Imagine that you get your product, you connect to your Playstation 3 or DVD Player or whatever. You see that it fits, it works, but then you see the other side of the cable and it is different, when you try to connect that to your home theater you realize it will never ""click"" so you need to put some silly putty or invisible tape to keep the cable in its place!! do you think that is acceptable? I think it is definitely not!I know the product is cheap and I shouldn't expect a lot from it, but the least I expect is that the product I see in the picture is the same product I get by mail."
1,Get what you pay for...,"This was a very cheap optical cable. I have purchase other inexpensive optical cables before and they work fine. This one is just cheap. The connectors are just a bit to small, so instead of snapping into the receptacle they just fall out. I was able to wrap the end with some plumbers thread tape to get it to stay put. This cable will be replaced as soon as possible."
4,They work,PROS: They work fine.CONS: Cheapish construction compared to the expensive brands.Conclusion: I'll go with these and save a small fortune.
5,Price WoW,This Optical cable was a bargain on Amazon and works great. With the my new RCA LCD TV which has Optical output I connected it to my Sony amp which is hooked to 5 bose speakers producing an awsome surround sound. You can pay more at the retail store but the results will be the same.
4,Great cable. Great price. Shipping high.,I ordered 3 of these as we got a new home theater. I love these and they keep up. Only thing is the shipping. A little high.
3,A little tape and you're set,"I picked this up so I could move my Xbox 360 further from my TV. My previous Optical Audio cable was too short to use in the move. The sound with this cable is fine and not noticeably different than my previous THX certified cable. The only knock against it is that it wouldn't snap into the Xbox 360 output. I had to doctor it with a piece of tape to hold it in place. It should be noted that the other end snapped into my receiver just fine. Sounds great, just be aware of the small added hassle if you are hooking up an Xbox 360."
2,flimsy but works,"So, these were on sale for $2 and for that price, they are reasonable buys. However, these wires are extremely thin and can be brittle so I wonder how well they insulate lights (i.e. the optic signals). They worked in my set up but I just can't bring myself to liking these rather flimsy wires."
3,Decent cable - not good for XBOX 360,"This cable works fine with my Sony a/v receiver, but seems a bit flimsier than I expected from the featured picture. Also, the connectors do not fit securely into the TOSLINK port on the standard XBOX 360 component cable. This might be a fault of the XBOX cable, however, as the optical cable fits nicely into the ports on the receiver and my PS2. Still, this isn't good for XBOX users, as the cable unplugs with the slightest touch. It's rather annoying, but the cable provides about the level of functionality I'd expect for the low price given."
3,Flimsy?,The cables I got do not look like the ones pictured. They were much thinner cables compared to the connectors and the cap comes off not connected like pictured. I think they switched distributors
2,Work but only with 1 of 5 of my Optical devices,"If the connection FITS then the cable works like any other Optical cable.My issue is I bought 3 and Im only able to use 1.They dont lock into place with my XBOX360, WDLiveHub, my SAT receiver, or my PC. it worked with my Optical switch (same company - surprise...) and my Pani Receiver."
2,Thinnest Possible Cable with Variable Sized Plugs,Given the price of the two cables I bought I don't have much grounds for complaint. The cables are not designed for use in a hostile environment. The jacket is very thin and each of the four plugs (a cable has two <g>) is a slightly different size. I managed to get both cables to work but only by trial and error with input and output jacks. I suspect they'll work fine as long as I don't try to unplug them too often. They do deliver the same quality signal as better built cables.
3,I feel like I'm going to break it.,The cable is super thin. I feel like it's going to snap. It does work just fine though. I'm just afraid when I get back behind my TV to carefully move the cable around so I don't break it.
2,do not by from sf corporation,"I purchased the cables from sf corp. they are not the same as in the pic and very very cheap, the wire is only a little thicker then the little metal wire in a twisty tie they use for bread."
4,Good enough,"The cable works great when it actually plugs into a device. I had trouble getting it to plug into my xbox 360. I couldn't get it to fit. So I just gave up. Then I decided to not let it go to waste, so I plugged it into my dvd. The sound of movies is significantly better and clearer. Its a decent cable for the price."
4,Works well enough.,"I used these cables to hook up my Vizio tv to my home theater, and my Mac Mini to my home theater (with a right-angle mini optical adapter). They work great for the price. No problems so far. They're a little 'thin', and given my setup (no overstretching, fixed-space equipment, never removing the connectors) I think they're an excellent buy. Not sure how well it would work for road-warrior applications or super-extension/coupling (they did couple nicely to the mini adapter)."
5,Works fine for me,I use this to connect the digital sound from my 360 into the digital input of my Gaming Headset Mixer. Works great. I haven't had any problems with anything falling out or anything.
4,Sounds awesome!,"I don't know much about optic cords, so i was a little worried that this one would be of low quality, but I run sound from my laptop to my tv, and then with this cord from my TV to my amplifier, and it sounds great. no distortion or anything. My only concern is how thin the cable is, because it can be easily broken or damaged when moving everything around."
5,Works fine,"I use optical cables for my ps3, xbox, dish, Pc, and tv. These work just as fine as more expensive brands."
4,Save your money - this is as good as it gets,"Worried about Judder on your optical cable?If so, you've been bamboozled by marketing no-nothings that are trying to sell you a cable to solve a problem that doesn't exist.Goodbye Monster. Hello cheap cable!"
2,Optical cable 6 foot,"Bought 2 of these toslink cables. Bad communication from vendor, very slow shipping. I contacted them once and only then did they begin the shipping process. Prices are good, but if you need them quickly........you'd better buy from someone else."
3,Useless Cable,"Cable may be good but cannot use it with the headset purchased, although it was shown as used with the headset."
3,Get what you pay for,"These work just fine, but you can feel the cheapness in the material they used in making them. The cord isn't as flexible as others, it's pretty much a stiff plastic sheeting around the fiber of the cord; so don't expect any sort of sharp bends at all. (then again one shouldn't really bend an optical cord) In addition, the tips on the end are not metal, but just hard plastic. I would have preferred a metal tip.They do work though, so it's all good. I just may have paid a couple of dollars more for a slightly higher quality piece."
2,Not using item now...,"Cable was ordered for an Optical-to-Analog audio converter which was delivered early. This cable was eventually delivered, but at the very end of a very conservative delivery period window. By this time, I had bought another cable over-the-counter, and had been enjoying the converted audio for some days."
3,Well?,Well I've owed these type of cables before and this is weird. The wire was thinner then my speaker wire. Seemed cheap and fake. I plugged it in and to my surprise it worked. Not much of a difference in sound but it's ok. Good for the price I suppose. I could see this being sold at. Dollar store.
3,Not xbox 360 compatible,"While inexpensive, the sub-par connector won't hook up to the 360's digital audio port - it just pops right out, unable to fasten. The cord does, however, hookup okay to my receiver and television."
4,Good enough for the price!,"PCD Basics Fiber optic audio cable reviewed here works very well for fraction of the price from other competitors who makes such cables, What more can you ask for? It works perfectly, The Sound receiver gets the signal and you are in business.It is slightly stiff not very flexible, but not very bad either, It is not that you are going to have a tug of war with this cable! Once connected where you intended, you will never have to touch it again. It is perfect for that.Well worth it!"
5,Hard to find cables at a great price,I wanted to get better sound out of my new flat screen TV but it doesn't have all the goes-in-tas and goes-out-as (inputs and outputs for you non technical folks - LOL). But it does have these nifty little fiberoptic ports for audio. Just needed an adapter to convert the fiberoptic signal to something my stereo understands (palin old RCA audio jacks). Bought one of those gizmos along with these and everything's great.
1,Cable plugs did not fit,"Cable male TOSlink plugs to large to fit into female TOSlink connections. I don't think, ""If it doesn't fit FORCE IT"" applied in this case. Returning item for a replacement."
5,Best optic audio cable around,These have to be the best audio cables I have purchased ever.I had to buy a I really like how thick the cable is and how flexible it can still be.I would advise everyone to buy these.
1,Flimsy connectors. Thin cable. Not what is pictured.,"The picture shows a standard cable with caps that are tethered so they don't get lost. What I got was a very thin cable, no tethers for the caps, and the connectors are loose and go in crooked.See the customer photos that have the thin wire for what is shipping now for this item. The connectors on mine looked flimsy compared to the ones pictured, but they are similar. Maybe some people like the thin style cables. For me, they just seem too easy to damage. The bigger problem is the connectors.I ordered a different set at the same time as this one (Amazon 2 x 12ft by cablemart). I'm using the other set that are made with the standard cable diameter and the connector went in with the normal solid click."
1,14 days from the order date and delivery!,"14 Days from the order date and no delivery yet! Very disappointed. 65% of my shipment cost was for shipping charges. Yet, it takes them 14 days (and counting) for delivery.....Cables are priced cheap, however, shipping charges seem to be absurd when the delay is taken into account. Hopefully, the merchandise will be worth the wait.... Bottom line, be ready for a wait of more than 2 weeks to get your shipment from this seller."
1,CAUTION,"Are you sure that this is what you're looking for? Some of the reviewers have complained that the prongs (male ends) are too short. That's what I have found. I wanted a fiber optic cable to go from my DVD player to my sound system. This cable WILL NOT work because the male ends are entirely too short. Apparently, either the reviewers leaving positive feedback are getting cables with the correct prong length or they're buying these cables for another purpose. If you have the standard Chinese or Japanese DVDs and sound systems, then this cable will not work for you. Take a good look at the photo of this cable. I tried to be smart and save a few bucks but instead..."
1,Doesn't fit properly,"The quality of the cable itself is great, quite flexible and good quality material. It comes with two caps that are attached to the cable, so that you never lose Great cable, except for the fact that the ends are not made to specifications, the result is that you just to look at it and it'll fall out. The weight of the cable alone can cause it to fall out of the socket, but hey, I paid a couple of bucks for this, so, I can't complain...but then again, I can. I'm replacing it with another one that cost the same couple of bucks from Amazon ([...]). Not the same overall quality as this one, but it doesn't fall out of the socket."
1,Didn't Clip into devices,"I bought this because people said it was cheap and got the job done. Unfortunately for me, it only was cheap. I tried plugging it from my TV to my surround sound system and the wires wouldn't stay inside the tv. As soon as you let go of the wire it would fall out of the slot, thus making it completely useless. I am going to spring the extra 3 dollars and buy the amazon basics product.Waste of money for me."
4,Its okay,Works perfect...but i didnt really notice a difference wen i switched from my red and white audio cables.
5,Awesome,"Cheap, and works great. Connected to my HD receiver and it sounds better than my old coaxial connection. If your thinking about it just hit the button and buy it."
2,Connectors too loose,"The cord works ok, but not great. The connectors on both ends are loose. If you move things around it is likely to pop out. The cord is also very thin, thinner than most other toslink cables I have, though this does not seem to impact performance. I would say its worth spending another $5-$7 for a cable that is higher quality and easier to work with."
5,They work as well as any other.,"As others have said, an optical cable is an optical cable. I ordered mine from SF Planet. They are indeed pretty thin, you definitely don't want to be tugging on them very hard or tossing them around. But they do clip in and they do work! Plus, at just over $2 each, you really can't go wrong! I'm using them to connect my original Xbox 360 to my receiver so I can get full quality audio, since mine is from before the days of HDMI."
5,fiberoptic cable,"I received the cable in a timely manner, and it was with out defects, works fine. I am happy with the purchase."
5,Works great,"This cable is cheap and does the job, much better then spending $20+ for those name brand cables when this cable does the same thing."
5,Buy this and not that,please dont waste your money on expensive cables. i do not care if people think they can tell the difference.the fact is: YOU CANT!!!!buy your friend lunch with the money you save buying this TOS cable.youll be glad you did5/5
5,"Makes sound, that's what matters","For under a couple dollars, you cannot go wrong. I've only had the cable for a couple days but I cannot tell a difference between it and the $35 cable I just returned to ""the shack."" It's not the tightest fitting but stays and produces sound and that's all I care about. Is the sound the best it can be? I dont know. It works and for a couple dollars, you shouldn't even be questioning it."
2,Toslink,"This is a second time I have ordered the cable from this seller. The first time - 3 cables worked like a charm. Second order - 2 wires(thicker fabric) and this time I'm totally disappointed because once I connect the wire to my Samsung TV and Philips sound bar it simply pops out in one or another end...seems like the ""head"" is too short or something. I used a blade to remove some plastic so the it could get deeper in the slot, but sill it is not holding as good the ones from the first order."
5,Buy this and save big bucks,Works exactly like the high priced cables. Save some money and buy this. Fast delivery.
3,good buy,i go my cable in two & a half weeks it made the sound quality on my home-entertainment center sound two times better then it did with rca audio cables and for the price it was a great deal well worth it .
1,The connectors are too loose!,"Maybe i just got a bad cable, but the connectors were too loose on both my HDTV and Receiver. I am returning this cable."
4,good quality and price,i used my cable with a PS2 and TV LCD and i don't have problems. it is good quality and price.
2,"Works, but don't think you're getting the one pictured","There's probably a little disclaimer somewhere that says the photo isn't necessarily of the same product you'll be shipped. But it's still annoying, even with the very low priced, to accept this kind of bait-and-switch. Yes, the cable works, but it looks quite fragile. The insulation around the cable is extremely thin and brittle, so I suspect it will kink very easily. But as they say, you get what you pay for."
5,Great Buy,"I am not an audiophile per say but I can appreciate surround sound and high quality sound. I used this cable to connect my Vizio soundbar to my Sony Blu-Ray player. It works great and enhances the quality of the movie-watching experience. The connection in the back of the soundbar is a little loose, but I suspect that is the soundbar and not the cable. For the roughly $2.50 I paid for this cable I am satisfied with the quality and was impressed how quickly it arrived in the mail. Another reason to skip the stores and shop Amazon."
4,GREAT VALUE--even with the high shipping charges :-),"Remember that an optical cable only carries light. Don't fall for the M.C. brand at the big-box electronics retailers on an item like this! The weak link on this very cost-effective cable is the connector. But I, like most of you plug it in once and forget it. This cable works great for that. If you're constantly unplugging and swapping cables, then get a higher quality cable with better ends. Otherwise, this will do the trick! It works great to carry the DIGITAL OUT from my PS3 to my old-school (read: one optical digital input!) Denon 5.1 surround receiver. Oh--the cable is inexpensive, but brace yourself when you see the shipping charges! Even with the high shipping, it remains a great deal."
1,doesnt work,"i tried it with 3 different devices into my receiver none work, they all have very weak audio and in only 1 speaker works at all"
5,Optical cable what a buy at AMAZON.COM,"I purchased 6 of these optical cables and they work just fine, no excellent. I use it on my PS3 for music and DVDs. I recommend these to any looking for an inexpensive optical cable that works excellent for the PS3 and my Denon receiver, Klipsch Quintet speakers (2)Klipsch SW10 powered Subwoofer 300-500watts, (2)Baby Advent, Samsung 40"" LCD, Nintendo Wii, Sony DVD/CD/MP3 player all have been made better with the optical hookup, sound quality clear,clean,crushing,cool the 4 c's of my standard of sound. AMAZON.COM has done it again with the best price around."
2,not very happy with this one,i am not sure if this item worked or not i guess i should have tried it but it was so cheap i just trashed it. the wire was only about 1/16 of an inch thick i didn't expect much for 2buck so not a big deal. it did get here very quick and for all i know could had worked just as good as the better ones so see for your self
2,Optic Audio Cable,"It did not work any better than the RCA jacks I was using.So, I went back to using the RCA jacks."
1,customer complaint,I purchased the ADPTR NIC on 9/23/2010I purchased the Toslink digital cable the same dayThe cost of these 2 items were $62.05The were billed to me and sent to Brian Fine who was to install them. The parts did not work as I have a cable card in my TV.He sent them back in the box and label provided on the week of October 11th. A response about my complaint of not being reimbursed was an incorrect e-mail address or mailbox is full!I have had nothing but positive happenings with Amazon! However I am waiting for my refund of $64.05!! I will not stop until I get my refund for the merchandise returned!Thank you Carolyn Schneider e-mail seaspan123@aol.comPhone 541-547-3239Address PO Box 1090Yachats Or 97498
1,"cheap cable, get what you pay for","Getting an optical cable for under $2 is a good deal. After reviewing a few of the reviews it appears most people got a cable that works well. I unfortunately got one that worked for 1 usage. Next time i turned my receiver on it wouldn't work. I can only blame myself for buying this cheap alternative, it really was worth a shot, so no big loss. I did have to pay $5 in shipping though which is lousy. So overall i'd say buy at your own risk. Even though this cable is cheap and may break VERY quickly, you may have some luck and it might last longer than mine did."
3,wrong,I brought this wire to connect the souuround sound to my T.v. but I brought the wrong thing so I don't know how the cables works but it was to cheap to send back for a refund so I keep it maybe it will come in handy at a later date.
2,Worked great...for a while.,"The cable arrived quickly and felt very high quality. It bends more easily and at a greater angle than most optical cables, which perplexed me since I'd read that fiber optic cables stop working if bent (see ""numerical aperture"").In any case I installed it and it worked perfectly for about 6 months. One day I was moving things around, unplugged the cable, plugged it in a few minutes later, and...my receiver gave an error indicating it couldn't understand the signal. I plugged in another cable and it worked fine. So a word to the wise: if you get this, curl it in a relatively big 6"" loop so you won't end up with the same problem I did!"
1,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. While full of detailed figures and schematics, the book is hodge-podge of information with very little logical flow. It jumps from 100,000 feet into the treetops with no explanation. The author peppers the book with his insights but without any context and background leaving the reader confused. As well, the book is dated given recent advancements in motor control technology."
2,Electric Motors and Control Techniques,"The information in this book is best suited to a physicist with a background in motors. If you don't already have a solid understanding about motors, servos and motor control already, then don't buy this book! The author covers far too much information at a very high level, makes too many assumptions about the reader's knowledge, and does not explain anything in easy-to-understand terms."
1,Electric motors,"I took an electric motors and controls class and we used this book. It was useless, hard to follow, format was difficult to keep track of what was going on. Someone with a PhD might be able to klean something from it, but I could not. I bought ""Electric Motors and Control Systems"" by Frank D. Petruzella. I used this book in my class and was able to learn a ton more about motors and control systems. You can read my review on that book. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,?,"LET ME WARN YOU HOT PRODUCTION IS MANUFACTURING THIS CDR AT HOMETHIS IS A CD-R NOT AN ORIGINAL ONE,BAD QUALITY"
4,Retro At It's Best!,"No this is not the 'jazz Jessica Williams'. This is the original 'Queen of Disco'(yeah,Donna Summer is), but in my opinion Jessica Williams was the 'Queen'. Here she sings about a bad boy lover who plays her for a fool, thats given her the nick name 'Queen Of Fools'.'Save The Last Dance For Me' a cover version.'Gambling On Your Love',''Tie Me Down', like 'Queen Of Fools' so infectious you can't help but dance and sing along.'They Call Me (Queen Of Fools)' a reworking of 'Fool' but still great. But my personal favorite is 'These Boots Are Made For Walking'(with Man 2 Man). Nancy Sinatra needs to move over. Miss Williams has just taken your song. If you are looking for pure retro fun at it's best then pick this one up. You can't go wrong."
1,Disco Jessica Williams! This is not the Jazz Jessica!,"This title does not belong with the other Jessica Williams CDs. This is the disco singer Jessica Williams, not the incredible jazz pianist Jessica Williams. Fair warning..."
1,AMAZON GOOFED,"Amazon has goofed in a big way. this is not Jessica Williams the jazz artist; this is mindless disco, by another person entirely."
2,cheap vents,"now i know why these vents sold at a low price, they were poor quality. 2 were bent & would not close properly. i would not buy an auto. vent again, to close propertly they need clearence all around the vanes, which means they have air gaps all around. they were however easy to install."
2,Automatic don't work,"I don't know why they do this, except for marketing. The bimetal spring that moves the louvers is not strong enough, and this thing does NOT close even at 30 degrees. I'd MUCH rather get a manual vent, but NOBODY SELLS THEM!!!Sigh."
5,Great outdoor shoe!,"This is a second pair of these in this style and color and can't say enough good about them for warm weather wear. The first was a fluke, and after having them for a month, I had to get another pair. Mostly use the first pair to mountain bike on trails with short wick-away socks and stream crossings are a whole different experience! These shoes are dry in a matter of minutes rather than hours after splashing through streams. I find they are comfortable immediately, and comfort continues for many hours of walking or riding. I generally need a wider shoe and these seem to form to my foot better than any purchased in the past. after a dusty day on the trail, just spray them off with the garden hose, and hang them to dry. They'll be as good as new!Buy them, you'll love the comfort and the coolness. Order a half size bigger than you normally get, these are sized a bit small."
4,They run small,"Great water shoe, I am tempted to wear all the time because it's so cool!but they do run about a .5 size small..."
5,"It's Motorcraft, nothing bad to say","This replaced the original hoses for a '93 Ford Explorer and so far so good, they have been installed for over 2 years now."
2,Poor transmission,"I wasn't very happy with this product. I can't remember the specs, but recall it fell into the realm I was looking. It did not provide a clear picture from 65 yards. The lens was not adjustable, and could not capture the entire are of surveilence desired."
1,Absolutely atrocious,"After 40 years in films, Joan still looks good and brings a little bit of class to this otherwise atrocious film. The other performances are hammy and overwrought, with incidental music and sets that bring to mind the worst moments of 60s' tv. Save your money and wait to see it on late (really, really late) night tv, if you must see it. I stayed with it just to find out about the 'dark secret' - which turns out to be some sort of utterly implausible fatal allergy to sunlight which afflicts the daughter (I tell people this so they won't feel they have to watch this terrible film to the end). Poor Joan - what a sad way to end her wonderful career - making rubbish films like this. You get the feeling that even she knew how terrible it was."
3,It's OK for Starters,"Considering this being the First game, it is Fine. The Second one, Chamber of Secrets is much better in comparison. What I enjoy Most in Both and other Harry Potter games are the short movie clips shown inbetween each level, like hearing and following a story or movie sequence. If you like the Harry Potter Movies, You'll Like All the Games. Some better than others, I'm sure. ENJOY!! I am!!"
4,Lost CD code,Hi ... the game of Harry Potter and the Sorcrer's stone has given me and my kids a great time ... however my computer crashed recently and while trying to reinstall the game I found that I had misplaced the original code. Please anyone out there please supply me a code for the installation of the game.Tandon
4,Greek Island review,"This was a great DVD. Just forwarded to the islands we visited, but I wish the visits to each island were a little more comprehensive and had more coverage."
4,Sad and beautiful,"I found this to be an odd, lovely book ..very painful about a young, abused girl and how shedeals with it. unique language and original. i loved it. It helped me cope with some of my own destructive stuff. i reccomend it.maybe you have to have had certain pain in life to appreciate this different book."
5,Every recipe is good for company,"The New York Times Heritage Cookbooks is one of my favorites. I have used it many times for company without trying out the recipe first. Each time there were rave reviews! The recent purchase was a replacement for my original which I used so much over the last thirty years it was beginning to fall apart. I can't describe my pleasure in being able to replace the cook book.New York Times Heritage Cookbook: Over 2,000 of America's Favorite Recipes"
4,Great introduction into Eiffel,"This book serves as an introduction to object orientation and the language Eiffel.As an introduction to OO, it does an okay job. There are better books on this subject, but there are a lot more books that are worse.As an introduction to Eiffel, this book is great. I tried learning eiffel from both Eiffel: the language, which is a reference guide, and Object Oriented Software Construction, which is avery academic text. This book takes you through the basics of OO and after that takes you through the basics of Eiffel.Once I finished this book, I had both a very good idea what the power of Eiffel is, how to use it and I was able to write real programs. (I do recommend Eiffel: The Language as a reference guide for programming real world applications)."
2,This isn't the best book on eating disorders.,"This was one of the most frustrating books to read on the subject of eating disorders because the emphasis seemed to be on the wrong things. When we think of eating disorders we must realize how much we still need to learn. There were so many references to ""ideal"" weights and dieting that it would be counterproductive for a patient with an eating disorder to read this book. Some interesting facts about eating disorders and pregnancy were mentioned in this book, and these seemed to be more in the authors' area of expertise. There are many other books written on treating eating disorders and the key seems to be treating the patient with compassion. There was confusion in the book in defining the different eating disorders because there aren't any international standards. In the U.S. we typically use the DSM-IV for diagnosis guidelines, but the guidelines used in other countries are somewhat different making this more difficult to understand."
5,Best of the best,"This is a fabulous collection, all these tracks were hand picked by Adam and Marco not some studio executives. You get album versions, single versions, demos and unreleased songs this set is simply marvelous going back to the old punk days of the Ants and into the most recent release by these amazing songwriters. I could listen to this set forever.Now if only we could ever get Persuasion released...."
3,Too much talk,I was dissapointed in the cd. There was too much talk and not enough music. I didn't want a history of Cajin.Chris
3,Fun Alternative to usual painting,"I run a preschool and we break these daubers out on occasion. The kids love them! They make a nice change up for finger painting and water colors. These are actually quite creative, you can write the child's name in large letters on butcher paper and then let them trace, they can use these for free drawing, they can even use them in lieu of painting. My only complaint, and I don't know that there is anything the manufacturer could do, but the children often pull off the sponge tip. I think they think it is a glob of paint. Before I can help them understand, the tip is gone! This makes it very difficult to be creative and fun with the item."
1,Its not what you ordered,"I ordered a 5-pack of Fluorescent Do-A-Dot paints for my 4 yr. old and received a 16x20 poster that said ""Positive People don't put others down"". Uhhh, what the heck? Just order your paints from LakeShore Learning instead!"
3,bonus material should be feature,"The best part of this DVD is the 40 minutes of ""bonus"" material where they actually talk about the process of making the music. The feature itself is boring--a bunch of people talking about how great each song is, with no analysis of what might have actually been behind each song, the recording process, or how the Doors adjusted to being their own producer."
3,this album deserves a better tribute,"This was a wasted opportunity. The editing could have been a million times better. There is no new footage at all in this doc besides a brief interview with Paul Rothchild. And even worse, the important additions to the band of bassist Jerry Jeff and rhythm guitarist Marc Benno have not been interviewed for this doc - a shame since their are both alive. Ray's musical demonstrations are way too long whilst Robby's way too short. John does the best work here, it is amazing how he drummed to Jim's words. Absolutely has no comparison in rock music."
5,Great Audio but be aware it's not a HD Blu-Ray,"I'm a long-standing TOP fan, so my review may be a little biased. I love their music and have been fortunate enough to catch them live many times over the years.It was fun to see (and hear) TOP alumni at this show. The band brought back several former members to help celebrate their 40th anniversary. The audio is great, as are the extra features (interviews with band members and a review of the band's history) but as mentioned in the title, it's NOT filmed in HD. That beinig said, the band was on great form. Bump City!"
5,Tower of Power - at their best!!!,"Wow, I can't say enough good things about this video of Tower of Power celebrating their 40th Anniversary. The music, video and recording are fantastic!! It's so wonderful to see all the current band members performing with ToP alumni on one stage!! And, to top it off, great interviews with band members, alumni band members and a special feature with an interview with Emilio Castillo and other founding members. It's a ""must have"" for any ToP fan."
2,Where's Johnny?,"Just received and zipped through all the chapters but what I thought I was purchasing based upon the link from Blu-ray.com and some of the reviews here, Johnny Meastro and The Brooklyn Bridge is not part of this recording. Appears to be a ""filmed"" Tower of Power stage performance instead. Once again on Blu-ray, no lossless audio option as the choices are standard 2 channel or Dolby 5.1. Quick note for those thinking about ordering this title so you wouldn't make the same mistake I think I did. Quick 2-star rating (less than an average production when compared to the many other Blu-ray concert/music titles I also own) is appropriate for the as presented video quality and lack of expected lossless audio options on this disk. Lastly, cardboard cover over clear plastic disk tray instead of the more typical blue closed eco case."
1,Great Concept But Just Didn't Work,"I bought this system through Target as my Mother wanted music throughout her small one-story ranch house that was easy to use. When we set-up the system, it looked good and the sound was quite good for it's intended use. Don't expect high-end sound quality but it was notable from a price perspective. The major problem was that the remote speakers kept cutting off for a few seconds every few minutes although the speakers were just 15-20 feet away from the base unit. We tried the extended range option but that created a really bad delayed effect you could hear throughout the house. It was very disappointing and a real deal-breaker and we are sending it back. I was really hopeful with the added options of EOS product line that this would be a perfect solution, sadly you need to look elsewhere."
2,Item didn't work,"The base system works great, but was unable to link with extra speaker, due to a broken link button. I went to exchange it and the Seller ANTOnline, made me pay for shipping back and then if I wanted a new one shipping again to re-purchase it."
4,music while you work,"I need ease and speed when taking time to add any piece of equipment to my day. This product provided both, but better than that the sound quality is better than expected. I love having volume control on each speaker - allows each team member to have control over their workspace."
2,EOS can't handle anything above low volume.,EOS Wireless can't handle anything above low volume. It actually sounds very good at a low to moderate volume but the sound very quickly becomes distorted at a moderate to loud volume.
2,Not real great sound,I thought for the money this system would be better. There is no base and a lot of distortion when the volume is turned up. There is no power off button either and that really bugs me.The only nice thing is being able to have music in more than one room. As long as you keep the volume low it sounds fine. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone. If your going to spend this much money get a Bose.
4,heirs to the new/no wave fortune,"to the punch: these guys and gal took the proper cues from wire, gang of four, and, more recently, satisfact. much more creative then the faint or the rapture's take on the genre. although there are no guitars on the album, it retains its heaviness with some cool, distorted synth and bass work. if you like the liars, oneida, or satisfact then you'll probably dig this album."
2,Ingriguing but at times confusing,"Given the title, it started off as expected -- celebrity, fame, drugs -- and then suddenly terrorists are on the scene? I found myself confused. Maybe not so much confused as disappointed, as spy novels aren't my bag. Perhaps it's all metaphor, I thought. And what's with the film crews lurking in the background? Only twice did I read more than 20 pages at a sitting -- once at an airport and the last time was just to finish the darn thing. Which is also unfortunate, as I bought the book in Mexico and was looking forward to an intriguing read. It was a bit intriguing at times, sure. Ellis has a massive 6-plus-page sexual interlude about two-thirds of the way through, and then there's the celebrity stuff and some ""cool"" torture scenes. But mostly I found myself wondering: What's with this celebrity terrorist thing? Whatever."
1,I waited five years for this?!!!,"Well, really eight years I waited for a new novel from Ellis. In 1994, he published a collection of short stories titled ""The Informers"". I thought that it was pretty good but I couldn't wait to get the true follow up from the classic ""American Psycho"". First, the endless list of celebrities that are named are annoying. Second, what was the deal with the ""camera crew""? I didn't understand whether the actor/model was actually being filmed or if the events were really happening. To make matters worse, there was a ""second camera crew"" informing him that he wasn't sticking to the script. WHAT??? Third, the book should have been titled ""Loopholerama"" because there were plenty of them. If Ellis' goal was to confuse and annoy the reader, he accomplished his mission."
1,Countdown to...less than ever,"Cute gimmick Ellis uses in his new book: all the chapters in each section are numbered backwards to zero, except for the last section, which counts *up* from zero. Still, all the gimmicks in the world can't hide the fact that this is the same fake ""oh, the world is so shallow"" routine from an author well-known for his nightclubbing and partying. I count this book backwards to...one star."
1,You can tell where this one is going from about page two,"Some people will enjoy the repetitive, predictable, aren't-the-beautiful-people-truly-shallow-and-aren't-I-sensitive-for-pointing-this-out droning that comprises this ""novel."" Different strokes for different folks, etc. But anyone who expects any real human or social insight, truly creative and incisive prose, complex characters, or an intriguing plot concept should skip this book."
1,Total mess,"A complete waste of paper/time/money. 500 pages of utter lunacy. No plot, tedious dialog, same scenes repeating over and over, loads of celebrity names to fill the space. Avoid this book and this author whenever possible!"
3,So is this where Zoolander got it's inspiration?!,"This is the first book I have read by Ellis, and I wish I had read this before I saw Zoolander. That stupid movie kept lingering at the back of my mind as I read this. In a nutshell, the book is a convoluted, twisted version of the flick, add or subtract a fact or two. The book was redundant about halfway through (the tone Ellis wants to convey to the reader about Victor and the vapidity and absurdity of his ""glamorous"" lifestyle got a bit long in the tooth) but after that, I couldn't put the book down. I was enthralled by the storyline, and I was repulsed, yet drawn to the gratuity of his prose. It was an interesting read, to say the least."
3,a literary prolapse of a festering modern value system,"This book, besides being a 400+ page run-on sentence, has no concievable or functioning point(and trying to find one is akin to scumming for credit card receipts at the dump)as Ellis pumps repetition until it stinks. Ellis' tired and weary formulae (a sprig of gratuitous violence, a dash of meaningless symbolisms, and a pinch of stumbling dialogue all in a steaming hot broth of high-style buffoonery) was better when it was called ""American Psycho."" Although the book has it's surplusage of putrescence, I didn't just read it, I pleasured it, as it tempted, taunted and teased me with it's privledged self of western thought and the self-conscious ""I"". I loved it. I hated it. Boy, can he write!"
1,What???!!!!!!,"I love reading. But, if this were the first book I had ever read, I would be turned off reading forever! I knew Bret Easton Ellis doesn`t write for the Norm after reading American Psycho (which I did like), but Glamorama loses it!. The book has no plot that makes sense. It jumps from being an almost logical story to one that seems like the author was having a major drug trip! Nothing is explained, there is no climax, no start and no finish. I don`t recommend this book at all."
5,Not what you'd expect,"When I first bought this book, I had no idea the twists and turns that it would take. Phenomenally written, I couldn't put it down. I felt sorry for Victor in the end, as he was caught in a situation with no way out. The end leaves you wanting to know more."
3,Uhhh?,"When I read this book, I could not put it down- until Victor left New York for Europe. After that, I could not piece together what was going on, I was having to reread the book, as I read I was constantly thinking ""did I miss something, or is part of my book was missing?"" I didn't ""get"" what the whole ""living in a movie storyline"" meant. Or the rooms being really cold so ""steam"" came from their breath. Or Victor's foot/body falling asleep. And what about these clones of people? Are the real ones so fake, any imposter can pretend to be them and noone notices? I REALLY loved this book, BUT I think there were WAY too many loose ends that I would have been happy to see tied. And WHY did Bret Easton Ellis allow Hollywood to make a horrible satire on American Psycho...."
3,wonderful prose,"This was a great read. I am now going to read all of Eliis' work. I picked this book up on a lark and I couldn't put it down. Although I do agree with some of the other reviewers that this isn't a perfect novel, it certainly does have the machine-gun prose that I enjoy. Wonderful!"
4,laughably frightening,"Never has Euro-American elite cultural fashion been parodied so lovingly and viciously as in ""Glamorama,"" where Ellis renders celebrity, glamhood, and modelhood into a shimmering super-world of symbolism and semiotics where every interaction between Victor (the male model protagonist) and his urban elite friends and enemies speaks volumes about our late 20th century minds that are inseparable from the voluminous media they devour hourly. Unfortunately, however, the book becomes laughable in its second half as it attempts to depict fashion models as anti-Zionist terrorists working to influence American elections by blowing up Parisian cafes. Ok, sure, it's a cool idea. I'm not trying to be some kind of zealous nerd here. But it comes off as absolutely laughable, and Ellis betrays his total ignorance of world politics several times a page. You may think that this shortcoming is irrelevant to the book's goal, but it sure makes it damn hard to take seriously."
2,another airport novel,"What starts as an interesting satire on celebrity culture and the shallow, amoral nature of the super-famous becomes a trashy, melodramatic airport novel. The first and only book I will read by Ellis."
1,terrible,"This book is full of characters about whom we care nothing, with a plot that makes 100 Years of Solitude seem clear and concise. It's pretentious, annoying, and completely unrewarding. I liked Less Than Zero, so I plowed ahead, thinking that eventually something good would come of this book, but it just gets worse and worse."
1,"He's human, he'll die eventually.","I've read all his works, up to Glamorama.I'm sick and tired of him. More and more viciousness, more and more shallowness. He writes about what he knows, which mostly seems to me the solipstic sociopathic universe centered on Times Square, with a diameter of about two miles.I'm praying that the superheated inhabitants of this little universe will soon self-combust: I'm tired of them."
3,Undecided,"I recently finished reading ""Glamorama"" and found myself without an opinion of the book. Maybe I'm just not well-read. I enjoyed the beginning of the novel. I found Victor to be hilarious and somewhat contradictive. I couldn't help but laugh at him. However after the club opening, I thought I was reading another book! It took a weird twist and I was left thinging ""what's the point?"" I did have to write an essay on this, so of couse, I had to find a point.If you're really absorbed in pop-culture (as I am), I think you'll find the beginning of this book to be absolutely hysterical. As for the rest of the book, I won't say that it was boring, because Ellis certainly hit me with a few surprises, but if you're merely a teenager who isn't well-read (like myself), the book may not turn out to be what you expect."
3,I just didn't get it,"I was totally captivated by this book and at times had a hard time putting it down, but have little idea of what was going on. Please feel free to shed some light..."
4,try this.,"the style is great, the portrait of the unbearable fashion world of the 90s perfect, the plot, ok, is a little bit trembling and the conclusion is a little bit confused. To all the 1 star rater I suggest 'Invisible monster' by Chuck Palahniuk. Similar world , amazing characters. Shorter , with a genial, totally hilaryous plot."
5,Ellis' Best to Date,"I was unsure about this book, but it is classic Ellis... his lyrical style is excellent, the characterization is meandering and empty, but that's the whole point. If you liked any of his previous works you'll probably like this one... it pays a little bit more attention to plot."
5,"B.E.Ellis at his best,I lived the characters twisted mind","Not since Holden Caulfield have i been so inside the world of a character as Victor Ward. This book reads with frightening realism. It gets you completely intoxicated in its world,farfetched scenarios become not only predictable but unavoidable. QUITE A TRIP, I RECOMMEND IT GREATLY!!"
1,Don't Bother,"This was the first book I read by Mr. Ellis and if this is any example of the rest of his work, please allow me to say ""Don't Bother!"" I found his writing to be jumpy and disjointed and relatively childlike in nature. There are about 1,000 subplots to the book that are never resolved and truth be told, I was never sure what the real plot was (if there was one to begin with!). The book reads like a who's who in early 1990's celeb circles. Mr. Ellis seems to want to make his readers know that he knows who's ""in"" and lists everyone from Kelsey Grammer to Bobby Flay. I shudder to think that all models/actors in the world are as shallow, idiotic and whiny as he represented them in his book."
1,How to write a book like this one...,"Take Jay McInerney's Model Behavior, rip off the back cover, then take Frederick Forsyth's Day of The Jackal, rip the front cover. Then glue both books together... continuity? Forgetaboutit! This is absolutely one of the worst books I've ever read. Buy at your own risk!"
2,What's going on in this book?,"It took me so long to finish reading Glamorama and after the umpteenth time I picked it up, I forced myself to finish it. It's a little confusing with all the name dropping and plot turns, but rather than being intriguing, it was much more of an effort to finish the book."
2,"The title is fun, but not much else","Didn't even finish the book. I didn't care enough about the characters to continue. What do I care about what happens to a witless, self indulgent male model? I couldn't relate to it and it wasn't original enough for that not to matter.Ellis always gets thrown into a litery catagory with Chuck Palahniuk but at the end of the day, Palahniuk's books feel fresh and original whereas the Ellis novels seem redundant and not all that interesting."
4,glamorama,"I read this book while on holiday with my annoying family, and it was the perfect way to get your mind off them. Though I had some trouble getting into the book, but once I did I never wanted to stop reading it."
3,Have we seen the best of Bret Easton Ellis,"As someone who thought that 'Less Than Zero' was one of the best novels of the 80s, I was somewhat disappointed by 'Glamorama'. I still think that Ellis is one of the more interesting writers around today. However, he seems to be repeating himself.Instead of a crazed serial killer obsessed by what people were wearing in 'American Psycho' we have a reluctant terrorist obsessed by celebrities (and what they wear, of course). The scene where Victor and Chloe spend time in California was very close to the time the main characters spend in Palm Springs in 'Less Than Zero'.Here's hoping that Bret Easton Ellis finds something new to say with his next novel. I will buy it regardless."
4,Solid Contemporary Fiction,"For fans of contemporary fiction, this book is a winner although it tails off at the end and does not live up to the level of Less than Zero. Still, Bret Easton Ellis maintains his status as one of America's best contemporary writers. I would rank him and D.M. Roman (the author of Fried Calamari) as the best contemporary writers today."
2,Terribly disappointed!,"After reading 'American Psycho' I was excited to read 'Glamorama' and I was so disappointed by the book. The book (so far) is 200 pages of names in the movie and music business - there is no story at all - I am trying so hard to push on in the book to see if something happens at all, but it is getting more and more difficult to do."
1,A Tremendous Disappointment!,"Being a ""Rules of Attraction"" fan, I was genuinely looking forward to this book. After 10 years, the prospect of reading about the Camden gang (Victor, Lauren, etc) in action again seemed like fun. Unfortunately, this book was a tremendous disappointment. Ellis has essentially written his own version of ""The Truman Show"", and a demented one at that. Even the plot (which always complements the nihilistic tone of his books) has less of a point than usual. The violence seems to have no other purpose except to shock and take up space. Speaking of taking up space, I read in an interview that Ellis took 8 years to write this book. Its hard to believe considering that about 10% of this 482 page book is exclusively devoted to celebrity name dropping. Thats less than a paragraph a day. Hmmm..."
1,This was the most incoherent piece of trash that I have ever,"I bought the book because I saw three people on an airplane reading it -- too much of a coincidence? No, we were all headed to the Cannes Film Festival. This book is totally unfollowable, incoherent and disgusting. Not just the violence, but the sex. I have read a lot and I am not by any means a prude, but this was too much for me. I usually pass my books along to others, but this went where it belongs. Shame on the publisher."
1,A little more than zero.,"I' m not fun of Ellis but I have read his previous books without wanting to drop them in the middle. This was not the case and if I had not hoped for a miraculously interesting end, I would leave it half-read. The surreal situations in Victor's life confused me immensely and in the end I felt totally lost. I don't know if the whole point was to leave the reader like this, but either way I didn't like it. As for the description of the life-style of all these ""glamorous"" people, I don't know if its accurate, because in my country the situation is very much different, even in these circles, but from what I know, I believe Ellis has managed to describe it very well. Finally, although it's a little uncofortable to talk for someone you don't really know (even though you read his books,) I found extremely to the point the remark of one of your readers, who said that he wouldn't want to be in the same room with the reader!"
1,I hated this book!,"Bret E. Easton is the most over-rated author of our time. This book was convoluted, bloated, extremely graphic, and violent. I will never read anything by this author again. Don't believe the hype on this guy."
2,A little bit of Kafka,"Ellis seems to give it a try with a little bit of Kafka. Everything is uncertain, even the label on your suit. Victor Ward or Johnson in Glamorama does never really know whats going on around him - may be the same is valid for Ellis: May be he has written two or more scripts and could not decide which one should be the one. So I was happy to reach the end of the book, uhm, like, the last page of the text?"
2,talent wasted,"Is it that mr. Ellis needs to write a book to become an established writer? He has the credit and now underestimates his audience. It is a talent to use your talent mr. Ellis. If you don't like hard work, find another job. Now we have to struggle through it. It's a two starr for the strong beginning and the respect to get all these words on paper. I could not read it to the end though..."
2,what happened to the American Pyscho?,"BBEllis was one of my favorites until Glamorama. I had ordered the book 2 months before it came out and I'm still struggling to finish it. I believe the problem lies with Ellis not even bothering to help the reader enter his own bizarre train of thought. Weak plot and not a page turner, and too many open ends which leave quesiton marks: whatever was Ellis trying to say about Victor getting chills all the time. Well I'm dissapointed but if anyone would like to present a counter argument I'd be most happy to read what I've missed out.Sam Ahmed"
4,Ellis achieves surprising success,"It is an unusual book in that if you don't read it right now, and I mean this month, or at least in the next three months, it is going to seem dated. It is a risky book to write and I'm not sure how he pulled it off, given the cycle time in book writing and publishing. Also it is highly entertaining."
3,is his heart in it?,"Ellis is a major talent, but Glamorama confirms that he is blase about his literary output. The opening is majestic, and very funny. Then he seems to bow to some direction to manufacture a 'thriller' type plot. This is so obviously against his natural impulses that what emerges is creative writing course stuff. Sadly,Ellis seems to have convinced himself that we really do live in the plotless universe that his anti-character Ward believes in,with the result that he seems to find it difficult to remain interested in his craft."
1,trying too hard,"Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Bret Easton Ellis. But this book was horrible! It had nowhere near the malaise of Less Than Zero nor the comedic satire of American Psycho. In Glamorama he tries to do for the 90s what these other two did for the 80s, and fails miserably. I think the Bret Easton Ellis decade is waaaay over. Sorry, wunderkind."
3,I lost the plot!,"The first fifteen chapters of Glamorama are breathtakingly good. Ellis is a virtuoso - he employs words and language to wonderful effect. This part of the book is funny, witty and addictive.However, then disaster strikes Victor and the book takes a turn. This is when I lost the plot! The second two thirds are a disappointment - I skim read the remainder of the story.Don't buy this book - but if you can borrow a copy, I'd recommend it, since the first 15 chapters are really wonderful."
1,I have never read a more pointless book,"I read the Amazon reviews and synopsis of Glamorama and picked it up expecting a good read. I have honestly never read a more pointless book in my life. This novel had so much potential, and Ellis just threw it all away. He created a protagonist too stupid and annoying to grab you. And because the character is too stupid and high to notice anything that goes on around him, you miss tons of possible storylines and character development. The main character's self absorbtion and stupidity made me almost physically ill. Ellis took a subject matter that could have been used to create a great social satire and instead used it to create more manufactured and movie ready tripe. Skip this one, unless you dislike thinking for yourself."
4,Ellis is still strange and interesting.,"Really a great read. the story takes you on a rollercoaster ride of time and places... first half is ok and then..BAM!, YOUR A WITNESS TO REAL TERROR AND ESPIONAGE...AND FASHION...YES. fashion."
4,This is the continuation of The Rules of Attraction.........,"No one has yet to mention that the characters in this novel are the same as the Rules of Attraction. I didn't figure it out until Victor Ward was mentioned as Victor Johnson.If you are a fan of The Rules of Attraction, then you should continue to read up on these characters in this novel."
3,Fashionable Terrorism,"Certainly a new twist on the shallow protagonist-driven novels Ellis usually produces, this one launches us into another realm, this time terrorism. It's an interesting combo for sure, and Ellis brings it off nicely. Not as painful to read as American Psycho, it still has the edgy angst that most Ellis lovers long for.The book definitely captured my attention and I found it hard to put down. But is it me, or is each of Bret's novels slipping by about 10 percent? Less Than Zero still seems the most acute work of his career.But whether you like or dislike Victor Ward as the model/maniac, you have to admit Ellis's writing is fun to read. It's witty, surprising and cutting edge. I laughed out loud too often to try and read it in bed with my wife. Pick it up in paperback."
2,There's a fine line between critique and covet.,It's like hanging out with a beautiful person at a happening hotspot in Manhattan: You have to spend the entire night listening before s/he says one insightful thing right before the lights come on.
1,i'm a glutton for punishment,"Glamorama: hated it. try American Psycho instead - his only decent effort to date. its far from great, mind you, but i loved it anyway. and, unfortunately, because of it i'll continue to read every single piece of trash this guy ever puts out."
1,"How utterly, utterly fab-oo","Oh but my dear, you simply *must* buy Glamorama, it's all the rage this season, my goodness, some people have even claimed to *read* it, can you imagine? Ellis is so tres, tres je ne sais quoi. He even manages to make models look positively dunderheaded. Can you imagine the *effort* that went into such a satire? Making celebs and other partiers look silly? Why he must have spent *afternoons*, absolute *afternoons* on the manuscript. I think even *I* am mentioned in there somewhere. (I'd never speak to the boy again if he hadn't.) Oh aren't I too, too wicked?!"
2,Fast read slow burn,"I read this book in a weekend; Ellis writes at the speed of light or city life, and you find yourself caught up in Victor Ward's impossibly full days...when the story shifts, however, and Ellis embarks on his thriller mode, the tale becomes tedious. I suppose at this point we as readers are meant to get lost in the switching allegiances, the bundles of names and deaths and parties, and to equate the shallow model life depicted in the first half of the book with the callous politics and terrorism in the second half, as if opening a club in New York is as cruel and meaningless of a sport as bombing a club in Bali...I do find it interesting that several contemporary authors wrote about terrorism in the 90s(DeLillo, Palahniuk) before it became the defining term of all we should fear - and that it is treated in Glamorama as a rupture and corruption in the cool smooth magazine life we are supposed to desire."
3,"Okay, but what happened?","American Pyscho was Ellis' masterpiece so this one haven't taken him eight years to write, I thought was just going to be the best. It wasn't. The first hundred pages I was totaly into it. Somewhere after that the story had me lost. While American Pyscho had me on the edge of my chair while reading, I really couldn't put it down, my reaction to Glamorama was the exact opposite. It took me months to even finish it. Having said that I'd recomend reading American Psycho a second time instead of reading Glamorama. Still though, it was better than Less than Zero."
4,"How to ""Get It"" and possibly enjoy reading BEE","Take a hit of acid, drink some strong coffee. Pick up a People magazine and look at the pictures. If yer educaded tri reedin it, tu. When you come down, retrieve your copy of Glamorama, admire it's ""edgy"" cover and give it another read. If you run into a confusing part refer back to the People magazine. You can also use Vogue, Details and USA Today as additional support materials."
1,Very hard to get into. narrative all over the place,A friend at work bought this for me as a present. He loved it and is a big fan of the author. So i'm sure a lot of people would have read and liked it.But for me... if you can't get into it in the first couple of reading sessions it's not the book for you.Terrible beginning it was all over the placedialogue is conversational and slang. doesn't give a good picture or back story to what ever they were talking about.GET THE TRIAL VERSION BEFORE YOU BUY IT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF
1,"If you dig your own grave, is it groundbreaking?","Remember those Twilight Zone episodes where a guy would find out his life was one big movie and he didn't know what was real anymore? They ran 30 minutes. You know Glamorama, that new Ellis novel where a guy finds out his life is one big movie and he doesn't know what's real anymore? It runs 464 pages. The choice is yours."
3,What' s the problem?,"Why doesn' t the pricipal character remember of so many things as the pictures he sees on the boat? Is that an important aspect of the book? Did I miss something? Please somebody help me, I love Ellis, I can' t stand this feeling of not finished..."
5,One of the best of the year,A cool mix of celebrity baiting and international terrorism centering on a self absorbed young man. After reading it I still don't know what to believe or what may or may not have happend. Worth the look and BEE keeps getting better and better. Hopefully it won't take years for the next book.
5,Hell Is A Place On Earth,"I have followed Ellis' career very closely and I think Glamorama is his greatest literary achievement to date. The growth he has undergone from his already great first book to the latest is astonishing. His first three books (""Zero"", ""Attraction"" and ""Psycho"") outline the private hell of certain individuals or groups of individuals. ""Informers"" and now ""Glamorama"" widen the scope to show that our whole society is going down the drain, they depict a universal sort of hell. ""Glamorama"" is one of the most frightening books I have ever read, because it questions everything we believe in. Even your own identity. Together with Don de Lillos ""Underworld"" this is one of the most important literary works of the late 20th century. It's the ""The Naked And The Dead"" of our times. But whereas ""Underworld"" leaves you in some kind of a limbo at the end, ""Glamorama"" sucks you into the terminal darkness of human existence where you encounter nothing but lonliness and emptiness."
4,For Bret Easton Ellis Groupies,"Well, as soon as I saw it was available I grabbed this book and devoured it. On one level, Ellis has not progressed from the discourse he displayed in American Psycho or the Informers collection. Same narrative style and approach. However, there's nothing wrong with that approach if you were impressed with it the first time round. Glamorama has been criticized for its awful dialogue - that's missing the point. If the way Patrick Bateman saw the world made you laugh, so too will Victor Ward's outlook. If you like the sense of humour and observations of his other works, go for it. If you like your books to keep it straight and simple, avoid this one."
3,"Sharp, funny, clever . . . but--","I love this author and the first section of this book is some of the funniest stuff I've read in a long time. The rest of the book is starkly different -- same character, still interesting, but decidedly not as fun. The inclusion of a ridiculously implausible terrorist subplot serves a purpose I'm still straining for. And after defending the blood and guts of American Psycho, which was, after all, about a serial killer, I was taken aback by yet more horrifying pornography -- the kind that would make a pathologist vomit. Luckily for the human race, I've never heard of terrorists, sickos, or ANYONE torture and kill others like Bret routinely pulls from his imagination. He's obviously gifted -- the scripts, camera crews, confetti -- but his fascination with acid and intestines is beginning to make me wonder."
