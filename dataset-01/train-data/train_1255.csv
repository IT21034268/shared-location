2,Works nicely for a couple of months -- then dies.,"Based on other similar reviews, I can only conclude that the WMB-2 has a fundamental design flaw. We received our first Cuisinart about two years ago. After one year of weekly use, it died and was replaced by Cuisinart (although we had to pay for all the shipping!!). The second waffle iron only lasted six months. The good people at Cuisinart should probably take this lemon off of the market."
3,Not again,"We had this waffle maker for about 2.5 years before it went out on us. We used it heavily and kept the control on 4. I traced the problem to a blown thermal fuse (ie too much current draw) which probably meant the heating element(s) were going out on it. I replaced the fuse and it blew that one too, so not really any way to repair them :(Cuisinart makes a great food processor, but I can't say the same for this waffle maker. I'm looking for a pro appliance to replace it."
1,Poor quality,"My husband and I received this waffle maker as a gift 3 years ago, but after approximately 1 year of light use, the item completely quit working. It appeared that there was a problem with the wiring in the browning control button. We returned this item to Cuisinart, and were happy to receive a brand new replacement. Unfortunately, this nice, new replacement quit working after less than a year of light use (we used it perhaps 6-10 times). The item is no longer covered under the original warranty, and I was informed by the customer service rep. at Cuisinart that there are very few companies that repair such items, so basically, what I thought was a lovely, high quality waffle maker will be heading to the landfill. I would be very sceptical about purchasing this item in particular (hopefully Cuisinart maintains higher quality standards for its other kitchen products) and encourage people looking for a high quality waffle maker to consider another brand."
1,Disposable,"Well, it worked as it was supposed to. As the warranty expired, however, it died soon thereafter. Being such a simple applience, one would expect to be able to fix it. Apparently, it is not even meant to be repairable. I have never seen such crappy screws in my life--they put them there once and for all, don't even try to unscrew them. Disposable--certainly not built to last."
2,Poor Quality,"I've had my waffel maker for 3 years and have probably used it once a month, tops. It died on me the other day and I come to find out that Cuisinart does not do any repairs. Phooey on Cuisinart!"
1,Unuasable,The waffles stuck so bad that I had to turn the machine of let it cool and scrape it out with a rubber spatula. I followed all of the instructions on when to put the batter in and when to remove the waffle. I was also using the recipe provided with the waffle maker. This is the worst waffle iron I've ever used.
4,A darned good deal!,"I actually bought this because I had an occasion for which I wanted to make Belgian waffles, now we make waffles all the time! It comes with a book of recipes--I use the traditional waffles and they have always come out great. You can choose your setting for how dark you want your waffles, which is nice. The grids have yet to get dirty as they are nonstick. The only reason I didn't rate this a 5 star is because there isn't a drip tray, so if you overfill the grids and batter gets out--then your cleanup isn't so easy. I would recommend waiting for a moment (approx 30 seconds) between waffles as we've found if you do one right after another they won't be quite as cooked. Overall this is a great addition to the kitchen--it is nice and compact so it doesn't take up much space. Plus, I'm always happy to have these waffles for breakfast!"
2,Good for about a month,"I have always liked Cuisinart so when it came time to replace our waffle maker I chose this one. I liked the features it has; heat settings, `non stick' and a light to let you know when it's ready and when your waffle is done.The downside is; there is no recommended batter level so when you use too much batter it flows out, making a big mess of the waffle maker and your countertop. After about a month, the waffles started sticking. I had to spray with a non stick spray and then that stopped helping. The latch became brittle from the heat and cracked so it doesn't lock shut. I am very disappointed with this waffle maker B=("
5,A simple handbook from a good spiritual coach,"This is a handy book providing quick inspiration and positive encouragement, filled with engaging anecdotes and memorable phrases. It's easy to read, direct and straightforward. The simple steps affirmed so personally by the author are empowering in their uncomplicated directness. Caliandro's style enables the reader to embrace kindness and stillness as the simple, yet profound, values they are and can be in our lives. Even if you do not savor every word of this book, there are bound to be several offerings to meet your need."
5,Great Clues-Great Story,I really liked this mystery - I hope there will be more. My two best friends and I solved this in just a couple of hours because we couldn't put it down! I really liked the quality of the printed clues too.
3,It was RIGID for about a year,"I bought my Rigid 12 gallon 5 horsepower at Home Depot just over a year ago. It worked well and I used it 5 days a week for vaccuming my gym. I used it for about 5 minutes a day and a bit longer on some days. Besides the hose collapsing near the handle--actually there's no handle, but where a handle should be. Other than that it worked well. Never used it for sucking up water just for dust and dirt. Anyway, my neighbor took it apart and said it shorted in the bundled wiring which is common. I guess I expected it to last more than a year even with everyday use. My Miele is 8 years-old and gets used 4 days a week and it still going strong. I paid $350 for it too so I guess you do get what you pay for. Just expected more from a Rigid."
1,This saw shocked me!,This saw was cutting really nicely until it SHOCKED ME! We followed the directions to the letter. It may be an anomaly with my specific saw but BEWARE!
2,Works but.....,I already own a Harbor Freight special tile saw that works good but the fence is unreliable and it needed a blade. So in comes this one. It looked like a great deal and had 2 blades with a more reliable fence. It worked and I used it on my job but right when I got it in I noticed it was much smaller than I thought it would be. It resembled a toy. Right off the bat it bogged down on the tile. I had to barely push them through. The water system is bad too. Too much water gets thrown off. On my other one the water return system worked pretty good. I wish I wouldn't have used it so I could send it back. But oh well.....My suggestion would be to get the harbor model or the home depot model. Much larger platform and more powerful.
4,qep 60087,"this is a great saw for small tile, however, after i made a table extension it worked very well for my large (18 inch) tile. i have read that the table top gets rusty but if you wipe it off after use it is not a problem. i have also read complaints about the size of the (non)""removable"" water tray but that too is not a problem if you attach a hose to the provided fitting and just let the water trickle in catching the overflow in a bucket if working indoors. i guess the only real compaint i have is the size of the table top."
4,workhorse,Great little tile and stone cutter; two blades come with the system along with hex tool and everything is self-contained. Swapping blades is a snap. One modification or update to the model would make it better; the water tray is not removable. So dumping excess water and the sediment that builds up from stone/tile cutting is cumbersome as you have to tilt the entire unit. Although the unit is fairly light; I went ahead and just placed a reservoir tray that fits in there and has enough clearance room from the blade and the sides of the unit. I use this primarily for small mosaic tile cutting and for precuts for cabachons.
3,"Passes the time, but it's not Ian Pears","This book has silly mistakes of reference, stodgy exposition about the art that reads like it was intended for a textbook, and a pretty predictable plot. It's a police procedural (not a mystery) and the procedure is generally ok, but none of the characters is well developed. It's passingly interesting for an airplane, but not much more. Try Instance of the Finger Post instead."
2,Entertaining but lacking any real character development.,"While the plot is interesting, the writing is weak and the character development limited. The author tries to keep us entertained by moving the characters from New York to London to Lake Como, but the interesting travels don't replace good character development. A fun read...that's about it."
2,"Some interesting footage of ""old"" Disneyland but story is BORING!","It was great to see the old vintage footage of Disneyland in the good 'ol days before it became ""The Greediest Place on Earth"" for it's outrageous parking, tickets, and food. It's horribly crowded now and Disneyland has lost a lot of it's magic. Disneyland was better back in the 1970s as I remember it with the dual Autopias, People Mover, Rockets, Circle Vision movie of America, and gondolas. Tomorrow Land was stripped of so many great rides and it looks a bit like a ghost town. Very sad to see the People Mover track just sitting there gathering spider webs. Anyways, the man on this DVD who talks about the history of the monorail just goes on and on and on and on!"
3,Wild In The Streets,"Although dated, the music still stands up for the period. Story line is good without being startling, but was great back in the 60's. Good to see Richard Prior at the beginning of his career, although I think his on screen role may have been a glimpse into his future. A lot of the acting is however quite poor."
3,"Ugh, creepy stuff!","I have to agree with Leonard Maltin about this being a ""dark satire."" That it certainly is! The bits about LBJ running against Nixon are interesting for history and political-science (especially since it didn't turn out that way), but that whole business about a teenage rock star using his music to brainwash the youth and becoming a hippe Hitler, spiking the water supply with LSD and putting people over 30 in concentration camps! Hell no, this won't go!"
4,Best Movie Ever!,"I can watch this movies over and over and over again and just ""Listen To The Music"" or really get into the movie and find the humor/satire. I can't wait until HBO/Cannon Video realizes ""The Shape Of Things To Come"" and releases this movie on DVD! Talk about a buying frenzy!!"
5,Actor/Artist Christopher Jones,"Wild In the Streets:I remember I wasn't allowed to watch thismovie when it came out, it made Parents andPoliticians, Very Nervous!But, it also showed the, Very Fine ActingTalent, of Christopher Jones.He has become a ,Very Fine Artist, also.I have bought some of his Prints and cannow enjoy his talent on my wall as well aswatch his movies!Patty"
4,Goodtime Classic,"Don't judge this movie on current standards; it is a product of its era, and is a decent look at a crazy time. Get in the mood and take a trip back to when we couldn't trust anyone over 30. Now I'm 64 and still enjoy movies about that era because I lived through it and survived. I also enjoyed Gas-s-s-s, right up there with such movies as Psych-Out and The Trip, though not as professionally done as Wild in the Streets."
3,Wild in the streets,"Unfortunately not as good as I remember. But still a hoot, especially Chris Jones and Shelly Winters, always an excellent performance. Thought he would be the new James Dean, but alas, no."
1,not as remembered,strange and boring not like i remembered it. nothing more i can say about it. i did not like it
5,Excellent.,"These two movies were very good, I have never seen the one called Gasss, it was a trip. I always receive a excellent product from this seller and I highly recommend."
2,KitchenAid Black Avocato Sclicer,"Do not like it ""squashed"" avocado. Disapointed cost way too high since it does not work as advertised."
2,"works, but not very well","I have read the other reviews that say that this controller works awesome and i has plenty of power. sounded good so i ordered it, and it shipped quickly. the set up was easy, but no instructions came with it. just common sence i suppose. long story short, the controller has a very weak charge. i have a great dane and a pit bull. they dont seem to be affected by it at all. the indicator light on the controller was blinking green for good to go. curious, i touched it myself to make sure it was hot, nothing a first then a little shock. not bad at all. this was at the end of my fence, so i walked right up to the controller an touched the wire right at the first fence insulator. same thing a very weak shock that doesnt faze me or my determined doges. i suggest if you have big dogs, get something bigger. dont know how horses cant handle it."
5,"Very effective, safe","We have a lot of deer and groundhogs where I live, so I used this to protect our vegetable garden this summer. I had it on a timer, so that it was only powered at night.Not a single critter crossed the fence, worked great."
2,I Refuse To Believe These Are Twizzlers,"I love Twizzlers. I always have and I always will. While picking up some household needs the other day, I strolled down the candy aisle in hopes to grab some of my favorite treats. Instead, I picked up Twizzlers Rainbow Twists. In a word: wretched. They are sticky, rubbery, strong-scented and utterly undesireable. Most of the flavors have a ""medicinal"" quality to them. The flavors included are strawberry, orange, lemonade, watermelon, blue raspberry and grape. Only the lemonade and grape flavors are moderately good in my opinion. Those two flavors are the only reason this product doesn't get a one star rating.If you enjoy other Twizzler products like I do, heed my advice and steer clear of this product. It's a huge miscalculation in the Twizzler world."
1,AVOID at all cost (even if you are starving to death.... death would be better),"The most disgusting, vile snack I've ever eaten! I love licorice and the regular red Twizzlers but holy cow, these Rainbow twists are just wretched! They all taste like perfumed plastic and leave a horrible perfumy after-taste in your mouth.Seriously.... how did these EVER make it past Quality Assurance check?Rainbow Twizzlers taste NOTHING like the flavors listed on the package.... they are an EPIC FAILURE!"
1,fatal design flaw,"I bought this because it seemed like it would satisfy my need for a 2-line phone with answering capability. Turns out, I cannot keep it, due to one boneheaded design flaw that makes it unusable for me.The good: it's nice looking, compact, has good sound, and has a selection of cute little ringtones.The bad: This machine WILL NOT RECORD INCOMING MESSAGES SILENTLY. It broadcasts both the OGM and the ICM being left by the caller through the speaker. There is no way I know of to defeat this. You can turn the volume down from loud to medium loud, but you cannot set the machine to record messages silently, in the background.Do you think you might ever not want other people in the room to hear the messages being left on your recorder? Would you ever want to sleep without being disturbed by the sound of incoming messages?Then this one isn't for you.Mine is for sale."
1,Motorola Phones.....last one for me.,"I am surprised not to have read this important design flaw in any reveiws. I bought the phone after reading up on it and figured this was the best there was for a two-line phone with answering machine. However, when you are sitting at your desk talking on Line 1 and a call comes in the answering machine comes on and rather than it being muted so you can carry on your conversation, it blares out the OGM and the callers message. This makes it impossible to carry on a conversation with the answering machine coming on. Note: VTech units knows this muteing is neccesary. Motorola customer service was surprised it was a problem. Jeez!"
2,Can't mute the outgoing message or call screening on the base unit!!,"I bought this phone as on impulse at RadioShak relying on Motorola's reputation. I guess I should have used my cellphone to check the Amazon reviews before buying it! I was very surprised to find that you cannot mute the outgoing message or call screening on the base unit. So surprised that I checked with Motorola and they confirmed this. Basically it's badly designed which is extraordinary given the experience Motorola has - for goodness sake, it's their business. Anyway, fortunately this is a low use line and I am only using one of the two line inputs in an area where people will not be disturbed by the uncontrolable call screening. The only good thing is that the phone combines corded with cordless and so will still be useable if there is a power cut."
1,Nice features on paper but terrible sound,"I was very hopeful that this phone system would be able to replace my aging 2G Panasonic system. It seemed to be the only choice for 2 lines with more than 4 handsets out there.The phone set up quite easily with a good menu-driven interface.The big problem, quite simply, is that the sound quality on the cordless handsets is terrible.Think about the earliest cell phone call you ever made.Think about the sound of two paper cups and a string.Motorola should be ashamed to have put there name on this phone."
1,waste of money,"this phone has been the worst purchase I have made in a long time. you can only link one base unit with mulitply handhelds, (ie: no intercom capability between them). it won't store the new time with the early day lights savings time. you have to be RIGHT ON TOP of the screen to see the display, the wall bracket does not double at a tilt to make the display easier to read from your desk. motorola is USELESS."
3,Good for my home office.,"This is just what I needed for my home office. My only complaint is the lack of a headset jack. But, as a reader you should know that I have a prejudice for Motorola products."
3,"OK, but not great","The base unit is fine (It was the only one that had everything I wanted), but the sound quality on the handset is terrible."
1,"Bad Static, Poor Reception!!","These phones had so much static, you could not hear!!! We ended up having to return the phones and find something that we could actually use!!"
3,Motorola 2-line phone - so-so,"The phone is one of very few choices remaining in the home-use, two phone line, corded base plus cordless remote area. It is functional but not as intuitive as I would have liked. There was a flaw with mine as well. Out of the box, the base phone has a poor numeric keypad with the numbers not all standing out where they can be felt when pressing them. A few are somewhat recessed and a bit hard to use. I do not use the phone's mailbox feature (I use an older phone that I am used to for that), so I cannot comment on it. All-in-all it works and suffices for my purposes but is not a stellar phone."
1,U got to be NUTZ!!,Price: $78.12Manufacturer's website: MOTOROLAMfg Part#: MD7091This product is BRAND NEW.This place wants $200???????????~STAY WAY~
2,"Works, but could be much better",No separate ring tones for the two different lines. I like the message on the answering machine to play first and then the date/time to be announced after the message which gives you time to press delete. This answering machine does it the other way.
1,A big mistake,"Wasted money on this one:- heavy interference from other electrical equipment, like microwaves and vacuum cleaners- menu system is not user friendly- BATTERIES FAIL ... FAST"
2,Buyer Beware,"One wonders if anyone at Motorola did any real world testing with this phone it's that bad. My wife and I work at home and we were looking for a good quality 2-line phone. Nothing fancy, we didn't really need an answering machine but just something that was easy to use and would not cause our blood pressure to rise when doing simple things like putting someone on hold and then retrieving the call. Unfortunately, it's neither easy to use nor a quality product one would expect from Motorola. The battery life for the cordless handset is terrible. It allows for 1.5 hours talk time, if that. We've also had other people tell us the call quality is not that great. All in all, a terrible phone and a waste of money as it's been such a hassle, we're now looking for a replacement only 8 months after buying it."
2,very corny film,"Kal Penn is cool and I dig some of his work,but this film is very weak. I dig the T&A element,but the storyline and lack of Humor bored me. it was only just ok at best. i expected a little something that would crack me up. I knew it was gonna be just kinda there,but it didn't even really go to being anything but just ok."
1,bad,One of my co-workers tricked me into watching this film.I liked the Harold and Kumar film so I had this niave idea that this film could also be good. HAHAHAHATHis film was obviously written by and for 10-12 year olds. WHoever wrote this film obviously has never attended college. However they have watched revenge of the nerds.everything about this film is bad.
2,Not Nearly as Good as first Van Wilder,I'd skip this version .It tries but its only average to less average fun movie. It is shame.
2,"Equal to the first, it is not.","I enjoyed this movie as a comedy, however, it did not measure up to the original Van Wilder. I think they would have had a much better response to this movie if they had not used the name Van Wilder in it. It is worth a little chuckle here and there."
2,Revenge of the Nerds meets Van Wilder,"What do you get when you mix Revenge of the Nerds with Van Wilder but remove Robert Carradine, Anthony Edwards, Ryan Reynolds, and Tara Reid? You get this movie, which isn't quite as bad as Nerds in Paradise, but close."
4,A Truly unique songwriter,"This is one of the most original and best independent releases I've heard in the past year (and I've heard a lot doing internet DJ'ing!). Her melodies take unexpected, fresh turns, the lyrics are rich, and the production is very good. Listen to this one."
2,Horrible Image,"Sound is ok, but image quality is very bad. So bad, that sometimes you can't even recognize people, even when you minimize your screen size... outch!"
5,"My ""friend""....Bay Tanner","What I love about Kathryn Wall's 'Bay Tanner Mysteries' is how you almost feel Bay is a good friend chatting with you about her life and then .... you are innocently drawn into the mystery you know is there, but which seems to slip up on you! Of course, living on Hilton Head for 28 years is definitely a draw! I also have a friend who recently became a part-time islander and is reading the series. Now, when she comes to town, she has a list of places she wants to explore that were mentioned in Ms. Wall's books...I'm enjoying the hunt for these places myself!"
4,Better and Better,This is the second book on the series. I live in the Low country so it is intriguing from that point of view but Bay is getting better and better as is each book.
2,"If you enjoy putting things back together, buy this.","What a disappointment. When fully put together and operating, this is a really fun toy that made both my boys, ages 3 and 4, squeal in delight. But as mentioned before, the minute you pick it up to move it, the legs, all 5 of them, fall off. There is also a support ramp that holds the climbing ramp that falls off constantly. We put ours on a little table, but when the table gets bumped, the track falls apart. I wouldn't buy this again. I am very disappointed in this toy. I can't imagine it would have been very difficult to have made the legs where they would ""clip"" in for more support. This was a major oversight.In short, if you like constantly putting your child's toys back together, you'll like this. If not, stick with the rich and wonderful Thomas Wooden Railway! Now THAT is a toy worth buying!"
3,"Fun, but flimsy.","Just bought this for my 4 yr old's birthday. Like a lot of little boys with autism, he adores Thomas. If I based this review solely on my opinion, it'd get a much lower rating. The pylons that hold up the track fall out very very easily. And sometimes in the course of putting them back, the whole track falls apart. Luckily, it's very easy to put back together. And the conveyor belt is noisy, and seems to go through batteries pretty quickly (thank goodness for rechargables!)BUT I'm finding it to be worthwhile to deal with the problems because my son loves it so much. I think this toy is going to be around for a long time, if he doesn't break it, rather than played with momentarily and tossed aside like so many other toys.If your child really loves Thomas, I'd recommend this toy, otherwise, you may want to skip it."
3,Thomas race on Rails Review,"I got this for my grandson's 3rd birthday. He absolutely loves Thomas, as does his older brothers. All of them were enthralled with the race at first, but the toy didn't last very long. It tips over quite easily, and that's frustrating for the little ones. Also, after a few uses, the trains wouldn't race anymore. They couldn't go down the tracks without a push. Changing the battery didn't help, either. If there were replacement parts, I would buy them, but unfortunately, I can't find any, so I guess the set will go in the trash. Unfortunate for such a cute toy."
2,EXTREMELY ANNOYING PEICE OF JUNK,"This toy is extremely ANNOYING. It keeps falling apart every second, no exaggeration here. It's worth $10 no more. $30 for this is highway robbery. I am thinking that I have to glue this thing to keep from falling apart. My son has fun for a few seconds then he gets frustrated because it keeps falling down and then I have to put those silly, poorly made sticks back on. Give me a break. I'm thinking of glueing it together, but then again I might return it for a quality toy, who needs to maintain a new toy?"
3,Not worth the money,"This is an adorable toy and my boys were so excited to receive it for Christmas, but the legs don't stay on. I've tried gluing them on but it didn't hold. The on/off switch is located in a difficult spot for little hands and it causes it to fall over. We spend more time fixing it than enjoying it."
5,sleeper hit of the holidays!!,"My almost 5 year old son received this from Santa and still plays with it daily. It has not fallen apart even once, and it took all of a minute to put together. He loves the little trains and the track and enjoys having them race around and around. Every time he plays he's telling a new story about the trains, the races, and of course the inevitable disasters that befall them. My 7 year old daughter also loves this toy. We have saved a ton of money if we knew this would be the holiday favorite!"
2,Big Disappointment,"We bought this toy for our son's birthday. It wasn't worth the money! The legs that held the track up kept falling off which really frustrated my son. It wouldn't have been so bad if it was every now and then, but it was all the time. It was noisy too, something I would have been happy to deal with if it wasn't falling apart every second. I gave it two stars because when it did work (meaning don't touch it let alone breathe on it) my son loved it. What good is a toy if you're not able to play with it? We ending up shelling out more money to buy another Thomas toy that he could play with. Save yourself (and your child) the frustration and buy something that's meant to be played with."
2,Don't waste your money,"Although my son loved this toy, it would not stay intact. The legs constantly fell off which made both my 3 yr old and me very frustrated."
2,"Fun, but not practical","My mom bought this for our thomas enthusiacs 3rd Birthday. Although this is a cute toy and he loves to play it...the legs fall off too easily and the trains do not drive aroudn the track as well as they should. He still likes to play with it, but I have to store it on his dresser to keep the legs and tiny trains from getting lost."
4,This toy is a keeper!,"My son is 3 years old and is beg. to like thomas the train- I purchased this toy as a starter to see if he would take the time to play with a train set. It is very cute - however, it is on the noisy side. The legs do come off very easy and cannot be glued (they come undone) He plays with it all the time and I would recommend it to others. The cars are very small so if you have other young children in the house you may want to think about that. It was definately worth the [money] we paid for it."
4,Racing Thomas,"This racing set has provided many hours of enjoyment for our busy 3-year-old son. He loves to watch the engines climb up the hill and race down the track. If your child is already a Thomas lover, this set will keep his/her attention for long periods of time - it does to mine!"
3,Disappointing,"This two-CD set disappointed me. Somewhere along the line, FoW seems to have lost the ""Power-"" half of the ""Power-Pop"" style they perfected to the unabashed extreme in early efforts.Thankfully the same, clever, down-to-earth lyrical style remains intact but none of the songs on these CDs has a hook, other than the made-for-radio Maureen. I kept waiting for this effort to ""get going"" but it never really does.I was left w/the impression that they were just going through the motions on this set to satisfy their recording contract."
4,Nick Lowe's Illegitimate offspring,"I thought music this fun and well constructed and so free of deep inner angst was dead. A great collection of supposed castoffs that exceed most group's best-of collections (Hello Sugar Ray!). Fountains of Wayne made me smile. Than I remembered how it felt to be 17 and want to get into Janice's Party. Somewhere in England Nick Lowe is smoking a cigarette, tossing one back and smiling. Someone has finally stepped up and taken the stage. As much as I like the Wondermints, this is who the Wondermints think they are. Completely free of artifice."
4,Guaranteed to make you smile.,"FOW runs hot and cold. Their first two records were uneven, but with some real highlights. With their third record they hit the big time and every song on it is terrific. Now, with this compilation, they have proven that their demos and outtakes are better than most mainstream stuff. The entire first disk rocks and disc two has some mellower moments (including a surprisingly effective cover of ""These Days"")among the rockers. If you can listen to this band without smiling, you're way over medicated! Marshall Crenshaw-style power pop! It's a glorious thing!"
3,"Great band, Mediocre Album","I love FOW's last two albums, but I think this one is for hardcore fans only. A few good tunes, but lots of throw-aways too. Should have pruned it to a single CD. Can't wait for their next real studio album, but this one will wind up in the used bin. Pick up Sloan's new singles CD instead - one of this year's best!"
4,No problem on my ipod...,"Just bought this cd & am listening to it now. Loaded w/out problems. Great cd collection by the way, 4 + stars."
3,not as good as Welcome Interstate Managers...,"Did not find much interesting or, frankly, good on this albumn - unlike other Fountains of Wayne efforts in the past. Kind of a let down..."
1,who can compair this with the beatles,"THis whiny emo/power pop, And compairing to the beatles is just silly. the beatles wrote good music"
3,Insight Guide to Namibia,"This guide has beautiful pictures of Namibia and gives you a good visual tour. However, it does not compare with other guides that give much more detailed information. This is a good introduction and almost a good memento because of the wonderful photographs. However, this would not be a book that I would bring along on a trip as a guide."
2,It's okay,"The album's okay, the quality isn't great, even for an indie release. But I give them credit for putting a lot of effort into the songs themselves."
5,One Of The Best Films Of The Year,"While I found the book ""An Ordinary Man"" somewhat boring and slow, the movie adaptation is, for lack of a better word, extraordinary. Don Cheadle gives an astounding performance as Paul Rusesabagina, who is the manager of the Mille Collines hotel. During the Rwandan genocide in the 90s, Rusesabagina provides shelter in the Mille Collines for hundreds of refugees. Like others have noted, one of the best aspects of this film is that it ends with hope, unlike other depressing true stories of genocide. No one can afford to miss this film."
2,Were is the genocide?,"I was very disappointed by Hotel Rwanda. It is completely inaccurate in the locations and in the manner it depicts the actors of the genocide. Furthermore big Hollywood strings were used to bring out the tears of the spectators using the same scenes as in The Pianist or Schindler's List.All the massacres happen in the background of the movie, no main character becomes a victim of the genocide. This somehow distances the spectator from what really happened.This is the story of one good man in the middle of hell, a Schindler's list Rwanda-style. I would have liked a movie telling the story about hell first, like Sometimes in April from Raoul Peck, to give the full perspective and not to focus only on an individual."
4,African Drama,"This movie was extrordinary. The casts were amazing. This movie is a preview of what wrongs are going on in and around Africa. It is enlightening as it is enjoyable. I really enjoyed it, hope you do to."
5,"Powerful Movie, Understated Performances","This was a terrific movie, if hard to watch at many moments, about the horrific slaughter in Rwanda that the West turned a blind eye to. Don Cheadle inhabits the lead role with quiet dignity and absolutely no scenery-chewing, which I find quite remarkable, given the intensity of the story. Like another reviewer, I thought the movie actually let the Belgians et al off quite lightly however the sense that we in the West should be ashamed of how we ignored the genocide permeates the entire movie. Watch this movie and think about how we have the responsibility to hold our leaders accountable when they walk away from violence, unrest and chaos that they create in another country thousands of miles away."
5,"If you don''t like it , don't turn away.","This story is not always pleasant to watch, but it is the true story of a very brave black man, who saved many persons, who were not part of any military operation. It is unforunate that our government does not want us to know that this happened and is still happening. If you bypass this film, you are justifying the injustice, which we can not condone. Can you live with that?"
4,Hotel Rwanda: Emotional and Suspensful,"A wonderful film about courage, survival and both the failures and rewards of our need to rely on each other."
4,Hotel Rwanda DVD,We often see the news and wonder what can or should be done. This movie shows us how one person can make a difference. I gave this movie to a teenage friend who wants to make a difference in the world. She loved it and so do I.The movie is well done. The subject is not for everyone. I would not allow young children to see it. But it is a film that every voting adult should see.Excellent performances by all actors.
3,Good acting does not a great film make...,"I really wanted to like this film but HBO ruined it for me. After seeing Raol Peck's ""Sometimes In April"", ""Hotel Rwanda"" just doesn't measure up. Don Cheadle is a fine actor but his performance alone can't save this film. It's shot in typical Hollywood fashion from a one dimensional script and the music is filled with embarrasing ""world beat"" cliches. Nick Nolte and Jaoquin Phoenix could have phoned in their parts and ultimately the film never reaches an emotional climax. I never felt I got to know the characters the way I did in ""Sometimes"" which focuses on 2 survivors and a perpetrator who tell the story with ""Rashoman"" like effectiveness. Skip ""Hotel"" and wait for ""Sometime's"" May release on DVD. It tells the story of the Rwanda genocide on a much broader scale and is a far more artististic piece of filmaking."
2,This film is an atrocity,"Another review said ""hackneyed moralizing"". I'd add, ""with some apologetic white guilt thrown in"" and ""hand-picked, predictable plot vehicles contrived for the dumbest audience members"". It ends up being un-convincing. Here you are supposed to be horrified at some ""atrocity"" and it's as phony as street theatre. It's a ""made-for-TV"" movie at best.One example: when some bloodthirsty thug has your life in his hands, and kills the person next to you just because he can, you don't stare into his eyes with a look of ""How COULD you?"". Instead, you make no eye contact and try to appear non-judgmental if not invisible, for the sake of your own survival(ok ""appear invisible"" is an oxymoron).If you want to see two good movies on the Rwandan genocide, try ""Sometimes in April"" or ""Shake Hands with the Devil"". The History Channel has a very affordable and superbly done documentary ""Rwanda - Do the Scars Ever Fade?""."
4,Memorable,"This was a very disturbing movie that stays with you for a long time. As always, Don Cheadle gave a moving appearance. It was very disturbing (and still is) that not is being done in that part of the world. A must see."
5,There are no words to describe it...,"As a news-hound, I've long enjoyed watching historically-based films that help bring a sense of truth and reality to our concepts of history.I had wanted to see ""Hotel Rwanda"" and was glad I finally did. More a docu-drama, the story is riviting. It is so hard to believe that this all happened only a little more than 10 years ago in a day and age where we, the West, pride ourselves in being a modern and mature world that thinks it is above the debase human nature that is in all of us.The scariest thing is that, in the right circumstances, those in Rwanda could be anyone of us. We all need to decide, in advance, what kind of people we are going to be: do we choose to love our neighbour, and pray for our enemies?The movie is graphic, but I think it is an absolute must that any parent, who feels that their child is mature enough to handle the violence, show this film to their child. This is just one example of what man can do to fellow man."
5,stunning,"this movie was one of the best i have seen in a long time. it brought a tragic event alive in way which made you want to help and learn more.the acting was amazing, the story so sad and heartwrenching. i can not think of anything about this movie that was not well done. you cannot watch this movie with out being affected someway. i reccommend it to anyone and everyone."
4,A skillful handling of a tough subject,"Why should one subject oneself to a movie on such a horror? I was apprehensive, but the movie was skillfully done in such a way that the viewer was aware of the horror of the massacre, but without showing the bloody gore.The interplay of the characters was interesting - and well done. At first I hated the UN colonel, but then revised my opinion of him. The changing role of the hero, from just wanting to get ahead as a hotel manager to taking responsibility for the lives of hundreds of people should be an example for all of us.The acting was great. Just when you thought the holocost was the last mass killing in our livetime, we find out that it was not."
5,Hotel Rwanda,"Hotel Rwanda directed Terry George is an extremely powerfull movie which depicts the ethnic cleansings that occured in Rwanda. The violence and cruelty is beyond imagination and I must say that I was deeply disturbed by the fact that Europe, United States did nothing to prevent this from happening. The script is extremely well written and the actors are astounding in their respective roles. There were several times, that I simply had to look away from the screen since I could never fathom the inhumanity and the brutality. One would have thought that the world would have learned something from genocides in Cambodia, and the balkans. But it seems the old adage still rings true, that the more things change, the more they stay the same. This is a movie that should not be missed since it is one of the most powerfull and disturbing movies that I have ever viewed."
5,MORE IS OWED TO MR CHEADLE,"Excellent movie. A real tear-jerker. Given that it is a true story, I was shamed that our government stood idlly by and did nothing to help those people. A real reality check and a must see!! Mr. Cheadle played and extrodinary character!!!!!"
1,Paul is no hero...,"I have been to Rwanda twice and have met and interviewed dozens of people who were at the Hotel des Mille Collines including Interhamwe who he dealt with.. The 'hero' of this film lied during most of the story. He charged money for the refugees to stay at the Hotel even though the Hotel Management in Brussels told him not to do so. He pocketed the money for his own profit and if people couldn't pay, he would throw them out to the Interhamwe for them to be butchered. He is no hero, he was a villain who before getting the spot at the Mille Collines worked at the Hotel Diplomat, because that is where the genocide government had their headquarters for the first few days of the genocide. If anyone questions anything I wrote, contact the Kigali memorial Centre, ([...]). If you want to use a film for your students, use either Sometimes in April or Shooting Dogs."
4,Wulfe's Woman has great sensual tension!,"I read Wulfe's Woman, very much enjoying the play between the hero, Wulfe, and the heroine, Cat. Both character's are fiesty and the dialogue between them is highly believable. If you like strong attraction and tension between the main characters--this one is it. It kept me turning the pages to it's heart-warming conclusion!"
3,Not the best but a good one,"I prefer the old recording as I think there is more depth in the cast and, of course, the Philharmonia orchestra is first rate. Sam Ramey in his prime was something else, the first bass I had ever heard who could actually sing all the notes.If you want to see this wonderful underrated Rossini, come to the Santa Fe Opera summer of 2012 where they will be presenting the new critical edition of Maometto II with Luca Pisaroni."
3,"Read ""The Benchmark,"" it's one of the best","The first story, ""The Benchmark,"" is one of the best pieces stories I've ever read. It's just one of those perfect stories. That the book isn't able to keep up with that level of performance isn't surprising but it's disappointing. There are good stories here but there are some mediocre stories too and I spent the last few stories wondering when I would be done with the book.For a great book of stories go to Tobias Wolff's _Back in the World_ or Thom Jones' _The Pugilist at Rest_. Dorris has crafted some good things here but there's not enough to hold the whole thing together."
4,Charlie Musselwhite's Southside System,"I bought this after getting ""Stand Back! Here Come's Charlie Musselwhite's Southside Band."" Good blues set recorded from Chicago club sets during the period of 1964-1971, with Neil Merrywether playing bass and sharing vocals alongside Charlie Musselwhite, Barry Goldberg, and Harvey Mandel on lead guitar. ""Low Down Funk"" is a personal favorite, and ""Cherry Jam,"" checking in at around 15 minutes, is a good workout for everyone involved. Harvey Mandel is a very underrated guitarist and has a great tone and vibrato. My only qualm is that it's a little heavy on the piano/organ. If you're a fan of John Mayall, Paul Butterfield, and white blues groups from the late 60's, check this disc out."
4,Lots of examples and variations on each style,"I have had a lot of rythum books and always get disapointed with the one or two examples in a particulare style, never enough to really get acquainted with any one style. Not so with this book, lots of example variations of each. However and it is a pretty big one, most are 1 to 2 measure examples on the CD and then you have to play out the rest of the remaining on your own (and add your own turnaround - not so bad really). Full examples would have been great and of course that would require an audio DVD or two.The grooves cover a broader spectrum of older original blues artists (no one new - think 1960 and before)A good companion book to this is ""Blues Rythum Guitar"" by Keith Wyatt, he intruduces a lot of the basics and breaks rythum styles down into Low (base lines) Middle (middle string chord voicings) and High ( high string chords voicings). Keiths book also introduces many of the chords used each section and gives lots of turn around examples."
5,Exact replacement,"If you have an ice cream maker that this fits, then you know exactly what you're getting. It's the exact same bowl that comes with it*. No better, no worse.* - I suppose I should say that I have the ICE-21, so I'm not positive that it's an exact replacement for the ICE-20, but I suspect it is either that, or a slight upgrade since the ICE-20 is an older model."
5,Great,This is great to have if you have the ice cream maker this way you can always leave one in the freezer and be ready anytime you want fresh ice cream r sorbet
5,extra fun,I purchased this to go along with the ice cream maker I purchased so I could have two different flavors to indulge myself.
5,You'll be thankful you have this extra freezer bowl!,"This extra bowl is exactly like the one that comes with theCuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice-Cream Maker, White, a double-wall canister that contains freezing liquid, so you can replace a damaged bowl or simply order to have an extra one. If you plan to use your ice cream maker a lot, you'll want to order this, especially because the bowl must be frozen for at least 15 hours prior to freezing, making it impossible to make two ice cream recipes back-to-back. With two bowls, you can freeze up one batch right after the other instead of waiting for another day to make the next flavor. Of course, that means that you must have the freezer space for both.Recommended for people with the freezer space and for those who frequently use their ice cream makers.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
4,Less mess and less fuss with the Cuisinart Yogart/Ice Cream Maker,It is a great little machine. Lot more handy and a lot more mess without the ice or salt.
2,Not what I thought it was,"The product was mostly PLASTIC! The plastic isn't very sturdy at all. It isn't something I would ever buy again.Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White"
1,unresponsive customer service,"The machine did not freeze ice cream very well. It was ""okay"" until the beater blades broke..."
2,Icecreammaer,Not pleased dasher does not scrape the wall or bottom lose a lot of ice cream. I would not recommend this productOnly good thing is it works faster than an ice and salt ice cream freezer. Will look for something else probably moreexpensive.
4,Additional bowl: heaven sent.,"We have been using our ice-cream maker for a few months now and love it! The only reservation is that we always want more ice cream! Having to refreeze the bowl before making another bath of ice cream had proved to be too time consuming! The addition of this second bouwl has resolved the only ""problem"" that we've experienced."
4,needed to make ice cream,Original bowl developed a crack and had to be replaced. Purchased the new one and am happy with time of delivery and quality of product.
4,Trust me - a half batch freezes better.,I love my Ice cream freezer but have found that a half batch freezes better. All the more reason to have the extra bowl. I freeze my ice cream in two separate runs. It's worth the time and money for the superior product with less overrun (air in the ice cream) and a smaller ice crystal (for a creamer product.) Why only 4 stars? Cuisinart makes a good freezer but not the best. It is however more than satisfactory for home use.
3,"Not bad, but they don't seem to last very long.","I love the ice cream maker, however, I noticed that after a while the bowl would not set. I think this love affair with ice cream only lasted a year. I don't think I noticed a crack in the bowl, and I'm wondering from those of you that have had the ice cream maker over a year if you've had any problems with the bowl. I am very tempted to give it another shot and buy another bowl. However, I am contemplating buying an ice cream attachment to my Kitchen Aid mixer, my sister-in-law has one and she seems to like it."
1,cruel to bettas,placing two male betta's in this where they can always see each other in such a confined space will lead to constant flaring and they will always be stressed. they will hit the walls and injure themselves. what a stupid idea.
2,Lees Aquarium & Pet,Even though betta can live in small place but I think this is too small for a betta. You will want to get at least one gallon tank for you betta.
1,Needs to be more education on Bettas...,"""Tanks"" like these need to just be taken off the market... small tanks are not appropriate for any fish and just because Bettas are cheap doesn't make them any less of a fish or animal. Until I recently bought a 3 gallon tank for my Betta, I had no idea what a difference it makes... you'll enjoy your pet much more if you don't just throw him in any old glass bowl/vase/whatever. My little guy seems so much happier... he loves going up to the tiny ""current"" the filter makes and swimming in it... he's much more active and swims all over the place.Take the time to get a filter, a tank no smaller than 3 gallons and a heater (they are really supposed to have water about 80 degrees!)."
4,Awesome product,this is a good tank for one fish but to small for 2 fish though. I have one betta in a bowl and next to it is another one. I think my fish likes it. it is very eassy to clean
4,"TWIP is definitely ""The Joint""","I believe this dude is really new to the game but I recall seeing his first video on BET's uncut which was very exxxxtra!!!! His latest song ""The Joint"" is on point. I heard the album was due to be released soon and I believe he has a song with Lil Flip on it as well."
5,Outstanding book for beginners,"I agree with the above review. This is a wonderfully written book filled with great photos and step-by-step directions to learn watercolor techniques. The 10 projects are beautiful and the directions are clear. The book is well-organized, and takes you step-by-step through the various techniques in watercolor. It's a beautiful book to learn watercolors from."
3,This is a neat little TV,"I have never owned a portable television, but I convinced myself I needed one because I had to work on New Year's Eve, and I really wanted to see the all the New Year's celebrations. I figured I would only use this thing once and it would join the ranks of the other forgotten electronics. Well I was pleasantly surprised when I took it out the box and actually used it. The reception was pretty good for being in a skyscraper. The sound was good. Plus it has a radio, which is cool. I think I'll be using this more than I thought, it may just take up a permanent place at my desk, and I won't be forced to tape General Hospital anymore, I can watch it at work."
5,SpongeBOB,"My kid is 2 years old and is in love with Spongebob, so of course he loves it I really think he thinks he owns spongebob for real now. It is small and fits in my hand and my two year old carries it all over the house. Its adorable."
5,Sponge Bob,"Very cute. Was for our sponge bob party that we had. This was going to be for a hot potato type of game, but no one wanted to be out. So, didn't work so great."
3,Cute for the kids,"My daughter loved this item, although it wasnt what I expected. For the price plus the shipping fee I thought it was going to be a bigger size, not the typical size you can get for a dollar at the arcade machine"
5,Cute as expected,"Our baby likes spongebob so we go this for his Easter Basket. It is as expected, right size, shape, colors, etc. Cute!"
5,"My Son's Best Friend, Spoge Bobby!","This toy is well built, compact enough for a 2y/o to carry around and cuddle in bed and close enough to the cartoon for my son to go NUTS when we gave it to him :-)"
5,Happy Teacher,I was very happy with this book. I loved it and so did my class. I plan to use it for many years to come.
3,Dance with the dudes,"Ivan Cattaneo, was perhaps the most transgressive Italian rock singer at the time of his first albums UOAEI and PRIMO, SECONDO, FRUTTA where he performed in concert with a fake cock attached to the nose. . Then went to the CGD and from there sprang glam albums like Urlo with lots of synthesizers and good singles.. Then the great success with Italian Graffiati ..... then silence, and long after a masterpiece like Luna Presente."
2,A little short of expectations,"Having merely part of the movie sound track proved disappointing. There was plenty of dramatic music to draw upon, and it was left out. Too bad. It is only half a project. Well done, but only half."
3,Swift it is,"Have SGTTG on old PC running Windows 98. Pretty simple and basic, But very quick and easy to learn and use. My version won't run on an XP or later equipped PC. Not sure however if that more recent versions do run on XP or Vista. I'd purchase one if so as I have downloaded more recent free planetery software and although it is very pretty I haven't yet been able to tell them to show me my night sky.Swift Guide To The Galaxy (for Windows 3.1 or higher) [ 3.5"" Diskette]"
5,A Cook's Joy,"The Cuisinart cookware is a joy to behold. The cookware is made of stainless steel and has a shiny surface. The copper core helps the food to cook evenly. You do not have to use high heat to cook, in fact medium-high is sufficient. The pots are a pleasure to clean. They are dishwasher safe and shine like new. The handles do not get too hot to the touch except if the pot is placed in an oven or using a large quantity of oil. These pots and pans are relatively lightweight, particularly for someone who has hand problems. I reccomend Cuisinart pots and pans over any other any other pot or pan that I own."
1,Caution... SNAG alert!,"I wanted to like this CD..I really, really did. But nonetheless, I find myself rather disappointed. Perhaps I was expecting pensive sensitivity, and not pining and whining. The boy does show signs of schooled talents, in both his safe vocal and guitar stylings, but the subject matter especially gets tired fast. A few tracks start to even sound ""same-y"", which is fine if you like that sort record."
1,"Worked for awhile, now it's useless",This iron made a few waffles fine. But subsequent attempts to make waffles have always resulted in such bad sticking that the waffle pulls apart when I open the iron. I have consulted others to resolve the problem and cannot. I blame a faulty Teflon finish.This problem really surprises me as I had expected Cuisinart to produce a fine product.
3,Get a Belgian waffle maker rather than this,"We've had 4 waffle makers in 3 years and make waffles every Saturday. This one does what it says it will, but the waffles it makes are not only flatter than our Belgian waffle makers, but also much less fluffy."
5,Dr. Bronner's RULES!,"Dr. Bronner's Sal Suds All Purpose Liquid Cleaner is a fantastic product. It really is ALL PURPOSE and does a great job of cleaning. I've tried it on everything from laundry to floors to countertops, etc. Great results across the board. A good price here on Amazon, too!"
2,Loved bf I knew ingredient Cocamidopropyl betaine was voted 2004 ALLERGEN OF THE YEAR by American Contact Dermatitis Society,"I was in love with Sal Suds before I investigated all of the ingredients on the EWG website. Unfortunately the second ingredient ""Coco-Betaine"" aka, Cocamidopropyl betaine was voted 2004 ALLERGEN OF THE YEAR by American Contact Dermatitis Society. Dr. B. website states: Coco-Betaine: Mild and easily biodegradable, coco-betaine is formed by combining coconut fatty acids with betaine (a nature-identical synthetic so-named because it was first discovered in sugar beets). This foam-boosting cleansing agent buffers irritation caused by SLS.I was using Sal Suds for laundry, cleaning, dishes, everything, and I didn't mind the cost before I knew this information. Now I've reconsidered my devotion to the product and will no longer use :("
2,still Mariah Carey Lite about 2&half for me,"I Like Her Voice alot,but the material still ain't truly touched Her Gift fully at all.I hope She reaches Her full Potential as to taken the safe route.She reminds of Mariah Carey Another Gifted Artist who still hasn't reached Her Full zenith yet IMHO overall.Christina is still missing that One signature cut&Hopefully she will get it,but this Mariah Carey Lite material is Cool for the vocal Gift but not the overall effect with the Music."
1,...! i wished i could give it 0 stars but i cant!!!!!,"ok, wanna know about this song? this is the most boring, totally stupid song. after realeasing songs that are ""trashy""( sorry couldn't find another word for fast songs) she excepts us to like this?? this is as almost as boring as ""reflection"" only worse. and i hate the video escpecially. she's dazzling around this old large room with a ripped nightgown. and i also hate the cover(i dont know why they didn't show it here). the cover is so disgusting, you'd think christina had died. it makes you to stay away from the cd. so overall: i hate everything about this single!"
1,3rd time is not a charm,"I have owned 3 of these little processors, problem is the motor keeps going out. After 3 dead motors, I've decided to move on to Kitchenaid. Sorry Cuisinart."
1,a lemon?,"I make yoghurt smoothies everyday and bought this mini cuisinart processor to use as a spare when my old mini Krups is dirty. The cuisinart mini is a TERRIBLE machine. It has too many safety features, making it more difficult to position the bowl correctly than the Krups. Spills happen. Also, it is incredibly noisy. This is a significant problem in itself, because you have to run it for what seems like forever to get it do its job, because the cuisinart cannot even puree a banana. After a few minutes of processing, big chunks of banana still remain. I don't have this problem with the Krups. Maybe mine is a lemon, but based on my experience, anything is better than this. By the way, now when I want quicker results with the banana I mash it with a fork first."
5,A must have for Hunters in the N.E or any place else !,"This book was very informative and entertaining at the same time. I could not put the book down once I started to read.A must have for the average hunter, with out the money to pay for a guided hunt. The Benoits and the author did a excellent job putting this book together. Can not say enough about how detailed they got in explaining, why they did things, how they did them, the cloths they used, the choice of guns and loads etc."
4,Deer book,this was the book my brother-in-law wanted to Christmas. It was exactly what he asked for. nice hard cover book with beautifu pictures.
4,Good Book,"Asatru is a wonderful path, I tend to believe it in league with and equal to Wicca. Most Asatru don't like the fact that they are identified as a subclass within the pagan society, so they take it out on Wiccans and do nothing but down us. When they are forgetting their own creed to respect what others believe. Ed Fitch did a wonderful job in this book. Freya Aswynn, an Asatru author even wrote that Wicca is based of the ORIGINAL form of Norse religion, witch was, just like everyone else, a Skyfather and an Earthmother, there are many phenomenons to both the sky and the earth, and so the other gods popped up to incarnate these phenomenons. I really don't like the attitude that Asatru has towards Wiccans. I think it is unjust and uneducated."
1,A famous book,"This is one of the few New-Agey books that almost every Heathen has read, been exasperated by, and disposed of ceremoniously. You do not need to be dry, petty, or academic to resent wasting your time reading complete nonsense.While some nonsense may be entertaining and interesting as fiction, this book is not thought-provoking, fun, or particularly creative. New-Age types may think Heathens take themselves too seriously, and in some cases they do. However, think about how Native Americans feel about buckskin-wearing New-Age gurus who parody their sacred traditions.Some may enjoy the book, and that is their prerogative. Many more will find the book frustrating, even offensive, and that perspective should also be respected."
1,"No, no, don't!","Please don't read this book. If you're interested in the Northern mythos or runes, find something by Edred Thorsson, Freya Aswynn, or just go to the Ring of Troth website. Please."
1,a good chew toy,"I finally found a use for this book! I let my pupply destroy it. She was pretty entertained for a couple of hours and the paper shreds weren't too difficult to clean up. I still probably would have been better off buying her a squeaky toy, but now I don't feel that the money I spent on the book went to waste."
3,Norse Wicca?,There was no such thing as wicca in the time of the Vikings. While people slam this book and it's author they also slam other authors and other people praise them.Like D.J. Conway whose book on Norse Magic is the same as her book on Celtic magic both have a wiccan flair only she changed the gods names. The runes are the Old English Futhorc runes. But not all of the runes do I recognize. The fact he leaves out the fact that Thor is Odins son surprises me. However I am Saxon Pagan and not Norse. I liked the idea of family which is what the pagan religion is about. He has a nice dedication to Hertha our Earth mother. If you want a good book read Travels Through Middle Earth and Wyrdworking by Alaric Albertsson. Awesome reading.. This is a fair book and has some good info but is not Odinism. All in all I liked the book but don't really follow it.
2,bug poop,"While not as butt-despicable as, say, Rune Magic by ""Deon Dolphin"", this is still a book to be wary of. I would expect anyone writing about Asatru to at least know the difference between ""thou"" and ""you"" ( singular vs. plural ) but this is apparently too much for Fitch. A similar ignorance affects the otherwise appealing artwork by Robin Wood : to use the runes Tir and Hagalaz for _th_ when there's a perfectly good rune Thurisaz available is sheer runic illiteracy and to render Freya as ""Freua"", using Uruz as _y_, is just plain stoopid. Alas, this seems to be the most popular book on the Asatru revival, if the number of copies I see appearing and disappearing in bookstores is any indication. A far better way to start is with Kveldulf Gundarsson's Teutonic Religion; once you've read that, Fitch can safely be read as entertainment."
1,The illustrations are nice,"Robin Wood's drawings of the Goddesses and Gods are about all that I like about this book. Even though this book is presenting the information for Wiccan and NeoPagan practitioners, NOT Asatru, the Wiccan information isn't really good either. ...."
1,Bad Comedy?,"If you are looking for entertainment, then it is worth looking into. If you are looking for any insight into the actual spirituality of the Heathen Reconstructionist religion, then this is not a good book. There is a reason that this book is considered to be one of the three ""No,No"" books. Poetic Edda, Prose Edda, Gods and Myths of Northern Europe, Myths and Symbols of Pagan Europe, Dictionary of Northern Mythology, Agricola and Germania, Sagas of the Icelanders this is a short list of books that will give good information as to the what the people of pre-christian europe believed."
1,DO NOT GET,If you want a book to learn odinism DO NOT GET IT.The person who wrote the book is a wicca he changed it to fit his belief.so DO NOT GET.I couldnt put a negetive one this is as close as I could get to it.
4,Wonderful and real story of love in a small town,"I saw this film at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and enjoyed it immensely. The cinematography is beautiful and the diologue is compelling. Anyone who has lived in a small rural town will recognize the relationships between these characters and the some of the ways they pass the time. Overall, a rich and layered film. See it!"
3,A real love roller coaster,"If this movie didn't make people with southern accents look so stupid,I might have given it a higher rating.The slow empty music is irritating in a drama like this.The sound tract is generally tentative.Ain't you been listening, girl? He has slept with everybody ( 26 is his count). Young love...so this time it is the real thing?His mom doesn't believe it either.They share secrets, then it hits the rocks."
1,There's more to making a movie than hiring actors and pointing a camera at them.,"This movie has a fine stock of potentially interesting characters. Unfortunately, you never get to know them. The movie suffers from an acute lack of directing, editing, script and continuity. Having a story to tell doesn't count unless you know how to tell it.The cinematography does have its moments. But intimate moments are shot from too far away to tell what's happening to the people; establishing shots don't fit together enough to establish anything. Musical passages are chosen not so much to create or enhance mood as to just cover up gaps in dialog.In order for a ""small town romance"" -- or any kind of romance -- to work, you have to care about the people. Without this foundation, all you have is random people going through random events.The high points of the movie are some of the supporting actors, and Zooey Deschanel, who manages to come off naturally even when she isn't given enough to do."
1,Oww! My brain hurts now!,"Talking...REAL...SLOW...like...this...does...not...make...you...an...authentic...Southerner...It...just...makes...you...sound...retarded...or...like...you...had...a...bad...dialogue...coach.I got this movie only because of Zooey Deschanel, who is such a cute sweetheart of a girl to watch onscreen. But even having her in this movie couldn't save it from its fatal flaws of a slow meandering dialogue and relationships that seemed to go nowhere. And those awful Southern accents. Nothing about this movie was authentic, the crying, the feelings of guilt, and lost opportunities, etc., etc. Least of all the relationship between the two main characters. Could not figure out who they really were or why they were together.It got to be a headache to watch this movie and have to try to listen to and understand those extra slow and fake Southern accents. Thank goodness for the fast forward. Thank goodness it was just a rental."
2,Wasted Opportunity,"This movie starts out with a different kind of love story: a lothario who meets that one girl who spontaneously makes him want to become a decent human being and something different for this one special love. The proposition is introduced brilliantly in this film, and the acting, though decidedly mid range in quality, is capable of pulling off a good drama. The directing is soemthing you'll have to put up with: short staccato scenes that jab you with story bits rather than drawing you into a dramatic sweep. But even with all these handicaps, this could have been a fine film. The problem is that the screenplay gives us nothing for its brilliant setup except futility. The result is disappionting and unsatisfying."
1,Couldn't get into it,I watched thismovie for like half an hour before turning it off. It was a slow story with monotone dialogue. I was disappointed since I like Deschanel so much.
1,Time wasted.,"The plot is weak.No chemistry between lead actors.Dialogs are poorly written.There is very little ""realistic"" about the movie, unless your reality is bottle's bottom.And grown up people mostly behave like children in a sandbox.I highly recommend buying this movie as a gift to your girlfriend, with whom you are about to break up."
3,A real surprise,"David Gordon Green's follow-up to his fab debut George Washington is a sensitive exploration of young love in a Southern mill town. Paul, Paul Schneider, is a 20-year-old rake who has slept with all the available girls in his town. But when he falls in love with 18-year-old virgin Noel, Zooey Deschanel, his emotional life suddenly blossoms. The complication is that Paul's best friend is also Noel's brother and so naturally protective of his relatively sheltered sister. An intelligent, delicate movie that steers clear of every cliche of teenage sexuality to ask some very pertinent questions about emotional responsibility and other aspects of love."
4,just a bit softer in reg temps,It's a good disk and takes a bit of the sting out of catch at reg. (80-90 deg) temperatures. Not sure if there is a bigger difference at colder temps.
1,Incredibly bad,"No amount of manufactured ""hype"" is going to save this one. Somoene should have told the filmmaker that trying to make these guys look cool and trying to give them a fluffy human-face buy having them tell us their sobstories about family members dying etc. would be a big, big mistake. Why not show these guys for what they are? Instead, we must watch these attempting-to-be-quirky interviews with these guys and it just gets more and more embarrassing for them and in the end, a total bore."
3,Hard to tell if its working well,"The first Sani-mate I received was defective. The light went out by the second day. The seller, Green Giraffe provided excellent customer service and sent a new one right away. The item is disappointing at first sight. It came in an unsealed brown cardboard box with some documentation inside. Upon reading the documentation, I realized that this is meant for a bathroom and has a range of 50sf. This was not stated in the description. Anyway the second unit works fine and you can feel an air stream being emitted. I put it in my bedroom because I smoke. Have not had it long enough to know if it is really doing anything. A good thing about this unit is that it needs no maintenance."
3,Meh,"Didn't seem to do too much, especially for the price. Crapped out after about 3 months of 24x7 use and I'm not sure if it actually helped."
1,Did not work,"Bought this thing about one week ago.They say its for bath rooms or small rooms.But just how small do the room has to be?it did nothing in my ""small room""then the light and fan stop working.So its going back,total waste of money.First off it do not produce enough ozone to make a different.Second it would have to be in a 5 by 5 feet room then maybe it might work if it don't stop working on you.Keep your money and ground level ozone is bad for you anyway."
1,This product is crap!,The Sani-Mate Plug-In Ionic Air Purifier worked for about (2) weeks. That was it! A waste of money in my estimation. I did not even send back since I did not wish to waste more money on shipping. Spend your money elsewhere...Zero (0) stars for this product!
2,Short life,"I purchased this Sani-Mate purifier in Feb. 2010. I put it in a small bathroom to keep the air fresh. It worked well for about six weeks then started sparking and a few days later it died. I recently pulled it out of a drawer, which reminded me to write a review. $40 down the drain. I have read elsewhere the life span of this purifier is 3-4 years."
2,Not a fresh maker,"I bought one for a small bathroom and one for near my desk in a very small study. I haven't noticed any remarkable air quality improvements (fresher air, odors eliminated, mildew stopped in its tracks) from either. Some attributes to note are that the Sanimate emits a bright yellow light (an indicator light perhaps; it's not a night light) and makes a consistent buzzing as well as intermittent clicking sounds. Both air fresheners have developed verdigris on the brass plate (the small circle on the front); when cleaned off, the brass/gold color doesn't come back. I'm inclined to suggest you save your money; sometimes a bowl of vinegar helps clear the air more (we live in a condo and the two rooms I used these in back up against the neighbor's kitchen odors...)."
2,Disappointed,"The skirt is way too long for my 5'3' frame. It has a faded streak through it. The color in the photo and the color of the skirt is different; the photo color is much more vivid and prettier. I'll keep it and take it to be altered, but not pleased about that."
1,No Chance that this Book Is Worth A Dime!,"I'm not the biggest fan of Vince McMahon in the world, and I do agree that he's been shifty in a lot of his business dealings in the wrestling world, but this book is NOT the place to find a good story about it. The author constantly rehashes well-known facts from just the last two years, instead of really getting in depth into the hows and whys from the past of Vince's takeover of the Pro Wrestling world. This just seems more like a personal attack, using the XFL and a couple of recent interviews to say that McMahon is going crazy. Unlike the author states, the WWF is NOT in danger of going out of business and Vince McMahon is NOT nuts. Read something interesting and entertaining, like books written by the wrestlers themselves. Stay away from this 150 page personal attack on the man who made wrestling what it is today."
1,This book [was bad],"If you want a more in-depth account of Vince McMahon Jr's rise to the top of the wrestling world then you should get Sex,Lies, and Headlocks : The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation by Shaun Assael, Mike Mooneyham"
5,"Love Annette Benning, Hate that other movie with Glen Close","This is one of my all time favorite movies. I have taken attitude lessons from Annette in this- which always gives my male friends pause. But why get mad, just get even. I also think Meg Tilly is great in this. It has not been available for a long time and I have contemplated the light fingers approach several times, so I am really glad I can finally buy it. Makes an honest woman of me, if anything can."
5,Valmont,"DVD was in excellent condition. Sound, lighing, dialoge were great. I am fully satified with this disc.Valmont"
4,Scene Missing from the DVD,"Pretty important one too. Has to do with Valmont giving instructions to his footman to get him ""roses."""
5,"A less dangerous adaptation of ""Dangerous Liaisons""","Valmont, far better than Dangerous Liaisons. With a younger cast, more lush photography, sexy surroundings, and the sinister Annette Benning. The cheesy Malkovich act is not here, thank God for that. Replaced by Colin Firth, though I really did not care for him, he did a much better act than Malkovich. But the big, brightest change in this film is Annette Benning. Playing the ""Catherine Tramell"" act on Glenn Closes' idiotic and ugly performance in Dangerous Liaisons, Benning shines above all and is superb! Buy it!"
2,yet another adaptation of Les Liaisons Dangereuseset - not the best one at that,"A Cruel Intentions/Dangerous Liaisons story, this is yet another adaptation of the novel Les Liaisons Dangereuseset. This movie is set in Baroque France about a pair of former lovers scheming to destroy an innocent girl, a married woman, and a few aristocrats. Annette Bening is downright evil, but rightfully spectacular, however, Colin Firth is the one to watch in this film. In the last decade, Firth has become typecast as a brooding gentleman, and is constantly replaying his portrayal of Mr. Darcy; it follows, that to see him in any other role, one must turn to his earlier work and find much broader, darker, more challenging performances (such as the one in this film, in his portrayal of the title character)."
4,A Close Call With Dangerous Liaisons,"I found this adaptation by Milos Forman to be better acted in some of the roles than the earlier release of Dangerous Liasons. Colin Firth as Valmont seemed more to be the type of Don Giovanni aristocrat of that period than John Malkovich's sinister rendition. Michell Pfeiffer simply failed to deliver a credible performance as an 18th century demoiselle; like many other method actors, she can only play herself. In that respect, Meg Tilly was more convincing as the innocent victim of Valmont's scheme. I did like Glenn Close more than Annette Bening as the wicked vixen but, overall, Valmont more closely represented the mannerisms and culture of 18th century France than Dangerous Liaisons."
3,Missing Scene,"This film is definitely the better of the two versions of Les Liaisons Dangereuses. The Widescreen DVD would definitely be the best way to experience this movie. The color is glorious. However, BE WARNED! If you own a VHS copy of this movie, don't discard it yet! Every single copy I have viewed of this DVD release has the exact same, (approximately 3 minute long), scene missing. The missing minutes, which are critical to the plot as it explains Valmont's actions in the end, occur in the Scene Selection ""The Return."" (Sorry. Rating loses 2 stars due to missing footage.)"
5,period piece,"reminds me of my goodold days and trying the same moves as valmont, but i did not die-makes it hard just to think about his women"
3,Why they changed the WHOLE story??????????????????,"A wonderful cast, superb costumes, and ... wow.. the rich settings, beautiful music... BUT... this is NOT *Les Liaisons Dangereuses*. The other film, with Glenn Close, is exactly like the book. Well, the three stars go to the movie, but Colin Firth deserves 10 thousand stars. I wish *I* was one of his victims :-)"
4,"Better than ""DL""","Personally, I liked Valmont better than ""DL"" even though ""DL"" had more of a bite to it.Colin Firth was a believable seducer of women unlike John Malkovich who's hideous! He was manipulative in a charming way. I wished that there would have been more anguish over Meg Tilly's return to her husband. I found out that Tilly and Firth actually had a real off screen affair after this movie and a resulting son Will(footnote) There is real magnetism between them.I did not care for the ending though-Valmont should have suffered more emotionally for his crimes of the heart onscreen. Death was too good for such a scoundrel!Annette Benning was both wonderfully devilish and charming and again more believable as a seductress."
2,Couldnt stand it!,"This is the nicer, prettied up, cosy version of Dangerous Liasions with the happier ending. I just personaly found it quite light weight and crass, and the story was weakened with all the tragedy, evil and complexity taken out of it- so as not to disturb tiny minds. It seems like it has been dumbed down in an attempt to appeal to the Hollywood market, despite not being as well known as the infinitely superior ""Dangerous Liasons"" that stared Glenn Close and John Malkovich. Although the cast had some good actors, their performances where patchy as if they hadn't quite got into character yet and the whole plot seemed rushed through like a dress rehearsal. But I know some people who love this version, so I guess it's just horses for courses."
3,Just OK,"I must admit that the main and only reason that I purchased this movie is because I am so in love with Colin Firth. Anyway, while it is an ok movie (totally no re-watch value)....ALL COLIN FIRTH fans BEWARE!!! There is a specific icky scene in the movie where he seduces a young girl of 15(and she really looks fifteen if not younger!). Anyway, I now want to go bang my head up against a tree until I have amnesia so I can forget this part! So if your wanting this movie to see the charming Mr. Darcy, Mark Darcy, Earnest Worthing, or the newest... Henry Dashwood, Then DON'T waste your money!!! My best advice, if your supremely curious like me, is to rent it if you can find it."
2,Few Bright Spots!,"With the exception of the performance by the actress who played Cecile and the wonderful first seduction of her character by Colin Firth this movie was a great disappointment. It captured very little of the excitment of the book and the ending is ridiculous! Madame de Tourvel lives, Cecile's pregnancy by Valmont is welcomed by Madame de Rosemonde!??? etc.-- and they accuse American movie endings of being pat and happy.Indeed, the many movements away from the original plot undermine the spirit of Choderlos De Laclos deliciously decadent offering. Dangerous Liasions is a superior movie by far!"
4,Fun but a bit hard,"It is a fun game but I thought it would be better than I expected to be. While the game is fun, it is a hard game to complete, like the Sonic Adventure series."
3,the game is ok,i kinda liked the game but the levels are kinda the same but in a different way and the bosses are the same in every level only in battle mode is different.
2,"Promising, yet a mess.","This is one of Sonic's worst games. Surely, it was the worst one on the Nintendo GameCube. To say that it was disgraceful and glitchy is the serious understatement of the week.The character's charms and voice acting was there, but the soul wasn't. The levels were nice and huge as promised but there were many glitches and the story left so much to be desired. I think we loved this game for 2 weeks and then it hit us: THIS GAME IS SERIOUSLY STUPID.Cover Art: CInside Art: ?Story: DCharacters: A-Graphics: BSound: BControls: ALength: D-2.3 stars.Overall: D-"
2,"Did not like it, too complicated","Bought this game to play with my 8 year old son. It was hard to use the controls, difficult to look around and move the characters. We didn't understand it at all, too many things to remember. We do not recommend buying this game."
3,Sonic Got Some Heroes,"Sonic Heroes may disappoint some people. It's filled with glitches on all three platforms. The camera is still bad like in the previous sonic games. It's still a solid game though. The only real problem I had with it was the annoying character voices. Tails and Charmy the Bee got on my nerves. You'll hear alot of lines repeated over and over too. The gameplay is alot more fun than Sonic Adventure 2. It's worth a rental, or if your a big Sonic fan you'll like it."
3,Half and half...,"You know, the story was great, the battles and adventure was great... but I didn't really like the graphics. It's either the resolution of my t.v. (which i doubt) or the poor work the makers of Sonic Heroes have done. It's almost like they rushed to get this game into stores... But i do recommend it for gamers who enjoy battles and team work."
1,Rhymes with Course Hit,"I'm a fan of both Dylan and Ives, but this album is TERRIBLE. Burl Ives covering Dylan sounds like such a winning prospect. Alas, he talk-sings these numbers in a half-hearted, lifeless manner that makes you cringe and laugh. And make no mistake, you will be laughing AT him, not with him. He sounds like a genetic mutation between William Shatner and Santa Claus gone horribly awry.Don't let this abomination turn you off to either Bob Dylan or Burl Ives."
4,Great Deal on Muscle Milk!,"This gets four stars just on price alone (about $44 at time of order). Taste is very good. So good, that it makes you think it can't be good for you. Also, this batch turned out to be older stock that expires at the end of 10/2007. Furthermore, this is still the batch of Muscle Milk that contains glycocyamine (GCC), which some studies have found to be possibly harmful. You can read more about the effects glycocyamine if you do a Google search or by visiting the t-nation web site. All in all, can't beat $44 for 60 packets."
3,Beautiful Photographs with Useful Information,"Essentially divided into two sections, Shibori: Creating Color and Texture on Silk, gives useful information on Shibori and contains beautiful photographs of the technique. The first half of the book describes: the properties of silk; the different classes of dyes available (with recommendations); the equipment needed; the actual dye process and; the importance of color interactions. The second half describes specific Shibori techniques such as sewn resists, clamp resists and pole wrapping. The 2 pages devoted to ""setting"" texture seemed, in comparison to the descriptions of the dyes and dye processes, abbreviated and could have done with an illustration or two. If you are the type of person who wants the essential facts presented quickly, clearly and concisely, then this may not be the book for you. If you enjoy having an overview of things before beginning work, then Shirbori: Creating Color & Texture on Silk may be just right."
5,Shibori: Creating color and texture on silk,Real eye candy! Good information on acid dyes and an excellent chapter on discharge techniques.
1,"Wonderful, I suppose...","This book has the highest rates. I am sure the readers are totally right. The reason ordered it was to include it in the academic bibliography. The alert I do here is about the seller brancampbook, who was payed and I never received the book. Their answer to may complain was ""it is somewhere"" in your country and a further answer was ""sorry"". Lost U$98!"
3,item as expected,item was just as described my ds just wouldn't take the rice cereal from the bottle. we have to spoon feed it to him.
1,Found this absolutely useless...,"I read the reviews and thought this was going to be the answer for the cereal bottles and bought 9 bottles in total. However, everything clogged in them and it never worked well for me at all.Also, Target lost my order and eventually it arrived, weeks late. Then, when I tried to return it for a refund, they had an administrative glitch and refunded us for $0. We just received the correct refund the other day, after multiple phone calls and time. Frustrating...A very bad experience with a product that worked very poorly for me.Not recommended."
2,Photo deceptive for more than one reason,"Yes, the stand appears wider than it actually is, and no dimensions are given. Photographing it without the leg extensions creates the illusion of greater width. Of more concern to me is the fact that the color of the legs is completely misrepresented in the photograph. The platform is a dark gray, almost black, but the legs are a very LIGHT gray, appearing almost white by contrast. My impulse was to return it, but I decided it wasn't worth it and spray-painted the legs black. The stand is sturdy, but the legs are plastic and look cheap, and the sections (too few and too wide for proper height-adjustment) do not all fit together well. The description is also deceptive; yes, something can be stored beneath the stand, but NOT paper: there isn't quite enough room for an 8 1/2"" sheet. Another couple of millimeters would have done it, so this is just poor design. Your move, but be warned."
1,This product is made of cheap plastic - Broken when I installed,"This product is poorly constructed. The screws putting it together are difficult to screw in straight, due to poorly constructed parts, and cheap plastic. One of the screws broke the plastic. In addition, the photo makes it look wider than it is. I strongly do not recommend this product."
2,Smaller than I thought,"You really cant fit a laptop under it unless its smaller than 12"" and the same goes for a full size keyboard. You also have to put it together with screws, etc. It doesn't come in one piece. It's heavy and sturdy, but unless you have a very small pc or keyboard, good luck."
2,Not Worth It,"The photo is decrptive. The photo makes it look wider than it is. As no dimensions are listed, I was fooled by the photo. It's only about 11"" wide. The screws putting it together are difficult to screw in straight, due to poorly constructed parts. You'd do as well putting an old book, or two, under your monitor; which is what I do with worthless old computer books, like books on Windows 98."
5,"Simple, durable, easy fit","Get the right height from a quality product with easy install. Only holds one monitor with little room for anything else. Works great with my 22"" LCD monitor."
2,only so so,I was disappointed. Its smaller than it looks. I thought I would have had enough room to slide my keyboard underneath. It doesnt fit. Even when I tried to slide it underneath thru the side. The legs of the stand wont allow it.
2,"This product is good condition, but...","I enjoy this product very much, but I canceled this item within 24hours. The manufacturer sent me this, and I decided to keep it and pay for it though I didn't wanted it. Anyhow, the product is new and good condition.I guess the manner how to deal with is important."
1,Misleading product description,"Product description says ""Weatherproof receiver is rated for outdoor use"" and ""Rainproof"". However, when I received the item there was a big warning on the package, ""INDOOR USE ONLY"". Misleading & potentially dangerous product description."
1,dis game sucks,"dis game sucks (...)bad if it had better fields more accurate gameplay and timed games and like a bizzillion uther things it might get 2 or more stars, but till then it sucks.P.S. if i could id give it zero stars."
5,NFL Street,"This games DA BOMB!!!It is a great game The part I like most is that you get to create your own 7 players and create a team.When you first start it is impossible on defense but when you get farther into the game it gets easier.I think it is the best game. Its create-a-player is very detailed.The part that stinks is that it is hard for SOME of the levels!I still love the game though!I wish they could have put all the Decent historic players but they only put the legends such as Ken Stabler and Walter Peyton.I wish they could have put Andre Reed(my favorite player),Thurman Thomas, and Jim Kelly on there as well!"
3,Not as good as I Thought But NFL Street 2 has Improved A LOT,I give this game 3 stars. It's fun but isn't realistic. Bilitz is at least a little real. You only have about 30 plays for defense and the same for offense. Defense is hard so this game is a high scoring game. You can do all these moves that are impossible and defense is BORING! But this game is pretty fun and the creation mode of a team and player is ok. I would still get it but I think Need For Speed: Underground 2 is better. But NFL Street 2 has really improved A LOT!!! I would pay the extra money for NFL Street 2 any day.
4,a new leage in football,i like this game. it is a great game to customize ur team playewrs and more. when u first start the game the controls and everything are very confusing but after the second game or so u pick up the game easier. the trash talk is very funny and entertianing and so is the enviroments such as on the beach were u can hit beach balls. overall this is a great game to add to ur collection.pros: great graphicsnot too hard not too easyand much morecons: wen u first play it the game controls r confusing and it feels like every thing is going real fast.
1,This game is dumb,"This is the worst football game i have ever played. First of all, when you try tricky stuff, you fumble every time. Next, defense is imposible. I should never have bought this game. If you want a fun football game, go with blitz or madden. Not this game."
5,Again I love all the colors. And I would definetelybuy again from Gems.,I love all the rings in all colors. I would definetly buy again from Gems.
1,Junk!,"Even though this is a cheap item, I would have to say don't waste your money on this horrible made item! The switch is very sensitive and when you just press it, it will turn on and then once its on the only way to turn it off is to take off the battery cover. It mixes well but makes a mess once it stops turning on and off. I have to put my bottles deep in my sink and pull it out of the bottles with it still spinning. The only reason I am still using it is because my daughter is on an 8oz bottle and when you are just shaking the bottle all the powder goes into the nipple and does not mix well. Thankfully, she is almost off formula. Will definately purchase the more expensive items for the next child!Also, smaller than expected! Does not reach the bottom of bottles."
2,Won't fit in Dr. Brown's Regular Width 8 oz. Bottles,"The mixer seems very handy but I could not use it as I intended because it would not fit down far enough in Dr. Brown's 8-ounce bottles (regular width, not sure about wide)."
3,LOVE THIS BUT....I do not agree that this is a great product for on the go.,"Don't get me wrong i love this thing but it does make froth like bubbles, so if you dont have the time to place them in the fridge and wait for the bubbles to leave then i wouldnt buy this item. I use this for the bottles i make up for those night time feedings. and for that i love this mixer! By the time I need the bottle all the froth is gone. (there are still some bubbles but probly not as much as u would get if you shook the bottle instead of using the mixer.)I use the Dr. Brown wideneck bottle but i think it would work great in any bottle. also i purchased mine at wal-mart for $3.96 plus tax. So u might want to check your local stores while your out shopping and save yourself the higher price and shipping charges."
4,Formula mixer,This is overall a good product as far as mixing well.The only issue I have is I had never seen one of these in the store and thought I was getting a good deal.When I got the product I saw one in the grocery store and realized I paid double for the product.I guess since it was Prince Lionheart brand that kinda makes it ok.
1,Mixer falls apart after about a month of use,"When it worked for a short period of time, it was indeed worth its weight in gold as other have stated. Shoddy construction has the stirring portion of the mixer unable to ""lock"" after about a month of use. Additionally, the screws holding the battery in start rusting within that time frame as well. This has only ever been hand washed and used according to the manufacturers instructions. Poorly constructed, rusty, and broken."
2,Great except...,"I have twins and this product seemed like a complete lifesaver when preparing 2 formula bottles at a time... HOWEVER... I just got to liking it real good when it decided to quit working after only 3 weeks... I am looking into buying the Munchkin version because a friend of mine has a 9-month-old and she has used that one since her baby was born, with no problems...."
1,way too powerful,It is way so powerful that it splashes the liquid everywhere..my point of buying this product was to help the formula less bubbling when mixing..but it created more..what a disappointment..
4,Great Invention,With my 8th child who is currently 6 weeks old we had to use Dr Brown bottles. You aren't supposed to shake powdered formula in that bottle. So we were looking for a way to mix the formula when we found this product. This product works and well. It should be pulsed when mixing. It is very powerful. If you use it wrong it will be like using a hammer to kill a fly. I am very glad to have found this product. My only complaint is for sanitary reasons it should have an option for a case.
2,Disappointed,I really wanted to like this product based on all the other reviews. Unfortunatley it does not mix the formula well. I do a better job mixing the formula by hand. The mixer is flimsy and cheap looking.
3,Helpful little gadget,"This mixer is good at mixing formula and for adding rice to formula, but we use Dr Brown bottles and it can't get into the bottle enough to mix the formula for me. I have to mix the formula in a second container/bottle and pour it into the bottle. This is no big deal when mixing in rice, but it would be better if the mixer could mix the formula in the bottle and save me a step! For now, we will continue to use it for mixing in rice cereal to be spoon fed/push bottled. However, I think it will work better for mixing hot cocoa later on! :-)"
2,formula mixer,Every time I use this mixer the stirrer falls off into the bottle. This item is not very good quality.
1,CAUSES FUSSINESS & GAS,"This product makes a froth of air bubbles in the formula that won't go away on their own. Even after I swiped them away, my son--normally a good eater and quick to burp--was fussy and squirmy during the feeding and had difficulty burping afterward. Another thing I didn't like is that you have to hold the ON button down at all times in order for it to work... kind of a pain. Preparing bottles is a little faster, but what good is that if it makes baby unhappy? A battery powered powdered formula mixer seems like it would be such a convenience, but I recommend sticking to the old fashioned wire whisk."
2,"It's a crapshoot - some work, some don't","We've owned two of these mixers over the past 6 months. They are indispensable if you formula feed (we're formula feeding twins, which makes it doubly necessary!).Our first PL mixer was great and lasted 5 months before the motor died. I recently purchased another and, after only 2 days, the mixer stopped turning when immersed in liquid.So, word to the wise, there's a reason why these are so cheap (actually quite a bit cheaper at BrUs). Buy 3 and maybe one will work for you."
3,Works well,"I bought this one because it had a lot of good reviews. I personally think it spins way too fast though. If you're not careful, the formula will go everywhere, especially in a 4 oz bottle."
5,good trashy soft core porn,pure trashy camp....good soft core porn....the girls a good looking...lots of nudity....it was a fun film not to be taken seriously.
5,"Great fun music, terrific find!","I saw these guys play in NYC a few months ago, and was thrilled to see this CD release -- super fun sound, one of those listen-to-over-and-over-again CDs!!"
2,INSTRUCTIONS,I AM A NEW OWNER OF A COMPAQ XP PRESARIO..I HAVE THIS INTERACT PC MISSION JOY STICK FROM MY GRANDSONS OLD COMPUTER...CAN IT BE CONNECTED TO MY COMPUTER AND IF SO..HOW??..WHAT DO I NEED TO DO...RIGHT NOW I DO NOT SEE ANY WAY TO CONNECT...THANK YOU
4,Joystick Review,The joystick was working fine and I liked using it. My problem is that it broke at the base and I have been trying to get a new one from the company. They have not respond to three e-mails I sent them.
1,Can not find driver.,"I bought two (2) of these Joystick. However, no driver was available. I don't know what to do with them now. My sons want's to play. I want to play. But we have no driver. Interact went out of business and now I am stuck. Don't buy unless you have the drivers for 98,Me and Xp."
4,Too Excellent For 1970,"I bought this on LP over three decades ago, just out of curiosity. I was flabberghasted. It's pre-fusion-era English jazz-rock, and has remained a rarity in America to this day, undeservedly. There are four songs listed, but the last one, ""Morning,"" an LP-side-length composition, could actually be considered several songs. You could definitely say that this group, led by the drummer, was one hell of a power trio! Great songs, great arrangements."
2,A book for your children,"After reading the first chapter of this book, one can see that this was intended for the 'Young Adult' section of the public library. The research background of the author seems...well, intuitive, rather than empirical. As a Cherokee writer, he seems to base many of his conclusions on his own experiences of what Cherokee people are like (independent, democratic, etc). But is this a rigorous method for historical research? I paired this book with other, more scholarly works, however, and since the fluffiness of the writing style did not take much brain power it is a nice break from more academic works."
4,Cherokee Nation,"This is a very informative book, but it is difficult to read and believe that our forfathers lied and cheated the American Indian is such a way with virtually little consuquences. If we treated any ethnic group in our country this way now, there would be anarchy in the streets, and probably should be anyhow. Our great America was stolen from them and we gave them over and over again what we didn't want, and then kept coming back to them to take even that away. David"
2,Clunky,"This cribbage board is difficult to use. The pegs don't fit the holes easily, and have to be forced in, or yanked out. It does not want to lie flat on the table, either."
2,Broken game controller,"This product was working perfectly, up until 2 days ago. The dog tripped over the wire, pulling it from the game unit, and from the pulling action, the plug part of the controller came broke apart and the wires are now exposed and I can't fix it. Boke too easily, we've all tripped over game wires before, and none have ever broken"
1,Not a good gift!,I just received one for this Xmas.The video it captured are so bad that you even don't want to look at them twice!Maybe it's not a good idea to use the parallel port for this kind of data transfer.
5,Excellent Product!!!,This is a great product. I reccomend it for anyone who is on the go. Using a laptop or at home on a desktop.
1,"Intolerable, tragic, unbearable, poorly written....","This book is tragic. The first book was okay, (If you can even call it that). Under the Northern Lights went too far. After the first book in the series, Summer of the Midnight Sun, she should have stopped writing and stopped the series. I enjoy Christian books very much; they usually end up on my list of books to read again. This book however, might as well go in the trash can. After reading that Leah Kincaid was sexually assaulted by her brother-in-law, Chase Kincaid, and then found out she was pregnant and did not know who the father was, I almost put the book down. After finishing the book, I realized I should have. Instead of reading this book, read MaryLu Tyndall's books, or skip to a book by Tracie Peterson that has favorable characters and a creative plot. This book is disgraceful, do NOT read it."
5,FOOOOOOO,"Foo Fighters are great, just like this album. I can't pick a favorite cause they all rock.Don't just buy this one, buy them all."
4,Took a long time to find out who sings!!!,"Max Bacon sings on 6 tracks, Paul Webb sings on the other 6 tracks. If you are a hardcore lover of Taken By Storm - you might want this alone just for the 6 Taken By Storm era tracks. Also of note, very strange ... but Bronz did a cover of Destiny's Child's ""Survivor"", with Paul Webb singing. Has to be heard to be believed, definitely different."
1,Radio,"Had a broken switch,The seller refunded my money,She was really nice about it,Cannot recall her name."
1,Book is as advertised.,"This is an old favorite. Nice to find good, quality copies still available. Thanks! (Why do you have, or need, a minimum of words?)"
3,Trashy yet Entertaining MM curiosity piece,"I liked this book as it was trashy, fun, and had really interesting plot twists with sick and twisted characters.Even though it was more of a curiosity piece as the main female character was a Marilyn Monroe lookalike who spent her life trying to be just MM. Good for the fans of MM!"
3,"Stylish, poorly made","I was really impressed with the purse as far as style and size. However, I was shopping at the mall and saw a small string hanging from the top of the purse and when I pulled it, the handle completely came loose. I had to spend an extra $5 to get the handles reinforced. The original price including shipping was very good, even with the extra $5 I had to spend to keep using it."
3,A really good start,"This is THE first AWB album. A little light compared to the others butit has a taste of what the group will become. I particularly like (put it where you wantit) (reach out) and the original version of (T.L.C.), AWB fans will remember this from their live album. Hamisch Stuart and Alan Gorrie are out front and it's only the beginning.Buy it AWB collectors!!!!!"
4,good intermediate-advanced yoga,"she definitely knows what she's doing. Can be a little hard to follow until you learn it--needing to watch the moves. That's less because of her instruction, but more because of the fact that it is ""flow"" and constantly moving. I enjoy these workouts a lot now that I know her moves--wonder if I'll ever be able to do the handstands!!"
3,Too intense for me,"This workout was too challenging for me. Many of the routines were long, which is fine for some people, but not a good idea for me. I wanted something that I could do for 10 minutes before work and 10 minutes before bed. This was not it. I am sorry that I purchased it. Additionally, I found it difficult to keep up with the instructor, which made me feel frustrated rather than relaxed. However, I didn't give it a terrible review (i.e. only one or two stars) because I can see the value in this DVD for some users. People who want a longer workout or a more physically challenging / strenous workout may enjoy this item."
3,"It's ok, but really New Age-y","I bought the DVD to add to my library. I have been practicing for years and am a certified instructor, but I haven't been doing much lately. I have sensitive knees and am always conscious of protecting them. Having said this, the yoga flow was kind of neat. It offered many poses that were designed by Shiva Rea, but the instruction on pose correction wasn't low. I really enjoyed the Krija beginning and the Water Abs were challenging (mentally and physically). The Fire and Water flow was too difficult for my knees as it is lots of knee balance (using the knee as balance point for the body in a lunge). The rest of it was really cool- the matrix does offer personalization and the scenery is lovely. I did wonder at one time how they rippled the sand after she walked into the mat surface..lol and I lost concentration wondering about the logistics. NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!"
5,Excellent Routines for intermediate to advanced Yogis,"First I have to agree with some other reviewers that this DVD tends to be more for the intermediate to advanced crowd. Though there are some beginner modifications, most of the routines would be generally too advanced for beginners to really get the most out of in my opinion.That said, I think the routines are fun, challenging, interesting, and invigorating. I also think they are very classy and well done. I think she does a good job of queueing when you are going to be faced away from the screen, and I didn't find it a problem to follow.I also really like the yoga matrix idea so I can mix and match depending on how I'm feeling that day, just do a quick 20 min or extend to 90 min if I need it. I usually prefer to do yoga in a classroom setting, but now that I am a mom it's not always easy for me to get away from home. These DVD's are my go-to when I need a yoga fix and baby is napping. I will be buying more of Shiva Rea's DVD's!"
3,"Just ""OK""","The DVDs are interractive and able to customize your own routine, but overall not super impressed with the workouts. The selection menu was confusing and should have had better descriptions about each segment or chapter of the DVD to choose from."
2,Lacks Instruction,"This is not the DVD for me. I work with and watch Yoga DVDs so that I can LEARN how to do poses, or do poses better. This DVD has little of that. The voice-over primarily tells you what pose is coming up next and how to prepare for the transition. Very little on correct technique. If you are an advanced Yogi and are just looking for different Vinyasas to try and are not interested in instruction then perhaps you may enjoy this DVD.One thing I DID like about this DVD is the set locations are BEAUTIFUL! Also Shiva herself is beautiful and wears some attractive outfits. Definitely some eye-candy, but not what I look for in a Yoga video."
2,"strange style of ""yoga"" (if you could call it that)","Unfortunately this foam roller is not the high quality cast foam roller that you see in the gyms. It looks like it is, on the photo. It is made of tiny little Styrofoam pieces, that all look like they are about to fall apart, and can easily be damaged. It does not look like it will last, without getting lots of 'chips', and 'holes' in in very quickly after a few uses... It is nice and long, and very dense, but the construction lacks any durability. i am very disappointed!! I got black thinking it would be somehow more durable than the blue ones.. Boy am I sorry!! The description does not state it is made of tiny styrofoam pieces, not the ""foam"" rollers you see at the gym. This one will soon have so many divots that it will impede the function! I'm going to make some kind of protective cover in the hopes it will last longer! Live and Learn"
3,Fair to Mild,"I found this book to be quite useful, however the subject matter was derived from an early edition of VB.Net and so found some things difficult to translate. The layout of the book is poor with new major topics starting at the bottom of the page, and the quality of the screenshots is very poor to be unreadable at times. I could not get the demo example to work - but this may be due to version conflicts."
1,Love Holzner but despise this book....,"I was looking for a more indepth look at ADO.NET to connect to databases. I thoroughly enjoyed Holzner's Sam's book (""Teach Yourself Visual Basic.NET in 21 Days""), but this book is awful. First off, it's bound up like a paperback novel, the screen shots barely legible at times. I had to break the binding to get it to cooperate while I worked through the examples.The content was put together decent but in a strange order. You'd be right in the middle of putting something together and then the authors would cut away to another project. I also found some of the ""tone"" to be offensive, talking about ""real programmers"" and what-not. I highly suspect that to be the co-authors voice, Bob Howell, but there's no way to know for sure.Don't waste your time on this book. Seriously, I'm not just being picky here. I've never thrown a book away before but I'm considering doing that, either that or donating it to my library."
5,Beautiful singing,"Another lost treasure from early seventies.Very unique music, specially the combination of the two voices of Clodagh and Alison.I think that this album is a combination of Pentangle and Reneissance, although the music is less symphonic and less sophisticated.The songs are well written and are like little stories with fine music.It sometime amazes me what made a band succussful?Why didn't that band made it?I think the answer is complicated and not for me to define.Listen to this band, inhale the soft voices and enjoy it from the first sound of Heaven Heath."
4,that other guy doesn't know what he's talking about,"i also didn't like this record at first..i put on side A hoping for some acid-folk psych kind of stuff but that's not what this is at all--kind of straightforward hippie rock...a few days later i threw on side B and was blown away by the first 2 songs ""reverend sisters"" & the one right after that which is GREAT...both written by cloughdohghg or whatever her name is...then i warmed up to the rest.."
2,DATED,The majority of this info is very dated and can be found in more up to date formats. Skip this.....
3,Just too much of a hassle to clean,"You can clearly see that there are NO bubbles that escape into your baby's mouth using this bottles, however, I think these bottle would only work with other treatments such as gas drops, special formula, in-between burping etc. That being said, I don't think these bottles, in the long run, are worth the price and cleaning ritual. If you are desperate and really want to try these out, buy no more then two and test them out first. My son's so called colic was over by the time he was six weeks (with the help of Alimentum formula and Dr. Harvey Karps book The happiest baby on the block) and I was stuck with this high maintenance bottles! My husband and I would take turns washing these things, taking us about 15-20 minutes to wash 7 bottles!! If you want to spend money, buy Avent and skip on the fancy, back breaking Dr Browns!"
1,These bottles did not work for my baby,"My daughter has reflux and is colicky so when I saw the ad for these bottles I thought that they actually might work(They boast about how your colicky child will be less gassy and spit up less). So I went and bought some just to try them out, My daughter spit up more when she was fed from these bottles than any other bottles. I followed all of the directions given in the box, and still it didn't work. I guess they work for some, but for the most part, everyone that I have talked to about them has also claimed they did nothing but cause more spit ups."
2,Kim,I didn't think these bottles were that great. My child isn't collicky and doesn't have digestive problems so maybe I would rate this item differently if she were. I thought maybe she would burp or spit up less with these bottles compared to regular bottles but she didn't. Plus there are more parts to clean. My husband hated them after the first couple of tries but I wanted to give them a chance. So after a couple of weeks I also gave up on them and use them as regular bottles instead of attaching all the parts. Save your money and get a different brand.
1,"Leaky, a pain to clean, clog all the time","My husband did a lot of research and was convinced these would be perfect for our daughter. Now six months old, she was born a 3 pound premie. We had a lot of trouble with the premie and stage one nipples. The bottles also leak terribly. When we go out, I have taken to carrying the formula in a large tupperware drink container and filling empty bottles as the day goes on. Our baby has reflux, a common premie problem. We are supposed to put cereal in her bottles to help prevent spitting up but the vents and Y nipples get so clogged, our poor baby sucks and sucks and nothing comes out. She gets so frustrated. They are also a pain to clean and mold grows in the vent. Do not waste your time or money."
5,Extra cleaning time is WORTH IT!,My son gets bottle and breast fed. I believe the reason he does not have nipple confusion is the Dr. Brown's bottles. We use the wide mouthed ones on the recommendation of a lactation consultant. The nipples on these bottles closely mimic a breast.I throw the bottles and all the components in the diswasher. The bottles and inner tubey things on top shelf pegs and nipples and the vent piece in a basket. Sometimes the nipples require additional cleaning and sterilization by hand.These bottles are easy to hold in your hand too. I love them and don't use any other bottles.
2,disappointed,the bottles were working great but then my son got thrush. Come to find out the green part of the bottle (which i washed and sterilized every day) got some type of mold on it!!
1,I Hate these bottles!,"I had added these bottles to my baby registry and also bought a few myself. Well when my son came along these were a nightmare! So many pieces to constantly clean, he had so much gas, they didn't reduce colic at all, and they were horrible to mix formula in! The cleaning didn't get easier since they all melted in the dishwasher and weren't supposed to. These were way too [$$$] and were worthless! I switched to Playtex Nursers [...]!"
4,Love the Dr. Brown's!,"Loved these bottles...never had problems with gas or bubbles. It is more effort to clean, due to the extra parts, but it's worth it. I highly recommend these!"
5,Works like a charm!,My grandson has acid reflux and we decided to try the Dr Brown bottles because of the reviews. These bottles are a little bit of a chore to clean but it is worth it. My grandson does not have near the air or bubbles when we use Dr Browns bottles. We have tried several different brands of bottles and these work for us. We are very pleased with the results. The burping and air bubbles are very minimal or not at all. Everyone must try them.
5,MIRACLE BOTTLES!!,"Boy I wish I had these bottles weeks earlier!! My son was born at 36 weeks and was not able to breast feed well, so was bottle fed as supplimentation. My milk never fully came in so at 3 weeks old he was strictly formula fed. I was using Avent bottles and he was having terrible gas pains! He would wake up from a sound sleep squeeling in pain! Even Mylacon drops didn't seem to help much. I remembered seeing an add on Dr. Browns bottles and read the reviews and thought they were worth a try. Boy I'm glad I did! My son is like a different baby! He is so much happier and I never have to give the drops. He started with these bottles at 7 weeks old. I wish I had them weeks earlier!! Yes they take a little more time to clean, and you have to make sure that too much formula doesn't get into the vent tube. But it is all worth it! I would do anything to make my son more comfortable!!"
5,Love these bottles,"I am a working breast feeding mom. My sitter and husband do the feeding from a bottle and insist on using the Dr.Brown's bottles. My husband will even use 2 small Dr. Brown's before he'll use a single bigger bottle of any brand. My baby took to the Dr. Brown's bottles right away. We rinse the bottles out after using them and put them in the dishwasher. I do use the little brush that is included to clean often, but I've never had a mold problem (as mentioned in other reviews). I usually spend $15 for 3 bottles which may sound excessive, but it's worth it! I get them for every friend who has a baby!"
5,best bottles ever!!,"We bought a 3 pack of these for our daughter before she was born and after she was here found that they were wonderful! We went to Babies R us to buy more and they were out of stock so we got a pack of avent bottles. Unfortunately she was up crying all night that night with gas from the avent bottles, they were horrible!! We fortunately found more Dr Brown's bottles at Toys R Us and I will not buy anything else from now on."
5,"The #1 Bottle for Babies on the new Milenium ""TRY IT AND SEE","I Tried all kind of bottles and my Baby had colic problems and more. When I try DR. BROWN'S Bottle all problem's desapear. Don't mather if it takes me a little bit of problem cleanning it, my BABY is #1 for me. Try it,and you're baby will smile and say thank Mom and Dad. Sombody who cares of babies healths. From Moca , Puerto Rico. P.O.Box 351 00676."
2,BIG Hassle,"I bought these bottles for our newborn before she arrived, and I wish I didn't. They leak like crazy if you hold them wrong, there's a bunch of little pieces you have to clean with a pipe cleaner (which I found to be a headache) and their no better than any of the other bubble free bottles. The nipples are also really long and big, which my newborn did not like. I now use either regular Avent bottles, or Playtex VentAire-which are cheaper and work awesome! To each his own I guess!"
5,Great.,"These came highly recommended. From his first experience w/ these bottles, our son has eaten well then burped loudly. I need to credit Dr. Brown's bottles."
3,Hassle to clean! Not sure if they work!,"I bought these for my son thinking that these bottles are definitely designed to LOOK like they prevent colick, spitting up, etc. During the first feeding my son spit up all over me and thats when I realized that these bottles are the same as any other classic bottle.Another problem I have is cleaning these bottles. When you have a new baby, you have tons of laundry, sterilizing, and feedings. Who wants to add to that by having to clean a 5 piece bottle????If you ask me these bottles are very time consuming and they don't seem to do what they are meant to do- reducing spit-up and digestion."
3,"Good bottle, BUT.....","My baby screamed for 3 weeks straight because of gas trouble. I was using the Playtex Disposable Bottles (flow is too slow!) at the time and was desperate to find the BEST bottle to eliminate gas. I bought the Dr. Brown's Bottles based on an advertisement and found them to work well. I don't know if it contributed to eliminating the gas as we also gave him prescription gas drops. I think the bottles work well enough (you can see the gas bubbles that are eliminated), however, they are a pain to clean! Also my 4 oz bottles have started leaking all over the place and I can't figure out why. The 8 oz bottles are fine. They say ""do not fill over this line"", but once you add the formula it does go over the line. Maybe that is the problem. I am considering investing in other bottles because the leaking is driving me crazy."
4,Good Bottle System,"With my son I used Playtex and he had gas all the time and I always had to make the nipple hole bigger. Dr. Brown bottles have been great for my daughter very little spit- up and minimal gas, no liners,and she has had no ear infections. She is 7 months old. The bottle does not leak- must follow directions- easy to get the nack of it. As far as all the parts I just put them in a basket in the Dishwasher everyday.The only two cons is the nipple- it is little and weird, but we solved that problem by using J & J's stage 2 Healthflow nipples; and the bottle with the lid is too tall for any small bottle bag(that is suppose to just hold bottles and food with ice pack)."
3,not sold on these bottles,I guess it's personal preference on what your baby likes as far as bottles are concerned. My son has trouble with the stage 1 nipples. They seem to be too big. I am still experimenting with other bottles. I was pretty happy 7 years ago with my other son using the healthflow bottles:) We'll keep trying out other brands!!
4,Great Bottles !,"I've used these bottles with my daughter since she was born. She is now 3 1/2 months. She's loved them from the start. I did try the wide bottle with her and she didn't take to the nipple, which seem to be very flimmsy. The skinny bottles are great. I wouldn't recommend getting too many 4oz bottles b/c they grow out of them quickly. I guess I'd say the best investment is to buy the 8oz, with a couple 4oz on hand for water or travel. As much of a pain it is to clean the many pieces from each bottle, I highly recommend the Dr. Brown's."
2,Good until your baby starts to hold her own bottle,"We bought these bottles - lots of them for our premature twins to help with gas reduction. The product APPEARED to deliver on that part. However, cleaning was a major pain, and you had to be very careful to prevent leaks - not easy when you have one adult and two babies. Now that our twins are 10 months old and holding their own bottles - they shake them, turn them upside down etc, milk goes EVERYWHERE! I have just thrown all twelve out including the three types of nipples and have replaced them with another brand that works MUCH better. I regret having spent my money on this product and all the time I wasted cleaning them when I could have been focusing on other things."
4,They just work.,"I tred Avent and others and switched to Dr. Brown/s. there's a reason they're patented. They work. No more gas pains or air bubbles. amazing. Yes, more peices, but so what, my babys comfort (and yours too) is well worth it . They do leak occasionally, but if you don't overfill and don't tip them up too high when feeding, When heating the milk don't leave the top tight, loosen it, then tighten it to feed or it can leak. they'e great!"
5,It's the best and your baby is worth it!!!!!!,"My child is 3 months old, upon bringing him home I tried Playtex with the ""Drop In"" bags, Avent and a host of other...so called gas reducing bottles....BIG MISTAKE! Before he was born I picked up a bottle that I had never heard of before, I did not know anyone who had used this bottle either. Finally at wits end... I decided to try this bottle I already had at home...IT'S THE BEST THING!!! My son burps with no problem now...even when he's extra sleepy and sometimes won't burp at all HE STILL DOES NOT HAVE THE GAS WHEN HE WAKES UP THAT HE HAD WITH PRIOR BOTTLES!!! I use the wide neck bottle to keep his mouth used to breastfeeding (I supplement with formula), I am happy, he is happy and he does not spit up great deals of milk as he did with all the other bottles!!!! It's worth every dime!!!! I use these bottles exclusively."
3,Dr. Brown's Bottles not too bad!,"I have tried both Avent and Dr. Brown bottles and have been somewhat satisfied with both. However, I have the same leaking complaint for both. As for cleaning, Dr. Brown's bottles do require more special attention than does Avent. As for mixing formula in Dr. Brown bottles, I remove the inner parts and attach the storage caps from my medela breast milk storage bottles to skake the formula. I have not experienced any problems with gas that are often associated with mixing and feeding from the same bottle. Perhaps letting is sit a minute to release the air will help. Also, if you don't let your child get to the point to where she's screaming for food, waiting for the bubbles to settle in the shaken bottle is no big deal. Neither Avent or Dr. Brown get two thumbs up, but my baby seems not to mind either one."
2,Leaks are a problem,"My 8 oz. bottles leaked, and I didn't notice any improvement in my son's spitting up/gas discomfort. Not worth the money to me."
1,Don't always believe what you read,"I bought these for my daughter before she was born, because the ad that I read in the parenting magazines was that is was to reduce spit-up, colic, etc. Well, everytime we used the bottle, even in her later months, she would vomit up her milk. I personally recommend the Avent bottle - the nipple is large, but they are wonderfully manufactured and developed."
1,waste of money,The Dr. Brown bottle was a great product at first. Then after a couple of weeks I noticed that the bottle started leaking all over the place every time she ate out of it. Then about 3 months after haveing the bottle the top part of the bottle that holds the straw in started to get mildew on it. I was very disapointed and I suggest do not waste your money on this bottle.
2,Not all that great,"I know a lot of people love these bottles, but they just did not work for us. They are a big pain to use, you can't shake the formula, you have to prepare it in something else then transfer it to the bottle. They leak, even if you don't fill above the line. They are a bigger pain to clean, and the nipples are too narrow and my daughter seemed to constantly be dribbling all over the place. She also would injest too much formula and choke. We switched to the playtex premium nurser and are all much happier."
2,Not the cure I was hoping for....,"My son suffers terrible gas. I tried changing his formula several times and gas medication but nothing seemed to help. After reading the reviews and listening to friends who had been through the same thing, I switched from the Avent bottles to the Dr. Browns. I purchased the wide neck version because the nipples are similar to the Avent and I felt it would be an easier adjustment for my son. I didn't mind the expense of purchasing new bottles or the extra effort to clean the addition parts, but after two weeks my son is still suffering. I was very hopeful that the bottles would make a significant difference but I am very disappointed with the results. I must say I have not had a problem with the bottles leaking as some of the other reviewers indicated. Just be sure to remove the top before heating the bottle as mentioned in the instructions and the bottles should not leak."
3,"Just a little annoying, but they work","I think Dr. Brown bottles work well and I bought them because they came recommended from many friends of mine, saying that they would reduce gas and fussiness with my baby. With that said, I'm not sure if she would have had a lot of gas or not with other bottles. The bottles have worked fine for her and she doesn't have that much gas but, they are annoying because of all the little parts and pieces that you have to 1)keep up with and 2)wash. If I had it to do over, I would go with a more simple design, with a top, nipple and that's it. Oh, and remember, if you buy the 4 oz, you are going to have to eventually buy the 8 oz bottles, so why waste your money?"
3,Good but not for all babies,"My son had lots of gas and was extreamly fussy when he was new. I bought these to help, and they did but the didn't cut it. He was better but still lots of gas and still fussy. I don't mind the cost of bottles for results. I ended us switching to Playtex VentAire. They worked better for my child(no gas no more fussy baby). He had problems with the nipple on the Dr. Browns. It was too soft. The bottles didn't help us as much as others have been helped."
2,Too much to wash and too often and Very Leaky!,"First, I would like to mention that these bottles are extremely leaky, I've had them for two months now and the bottles are usually always with a ring of milk underneth them after they've been used & these bottles also leak while they are in the bottle warmer and I have to be cleaning it all the time and all the parts from the bottle seem like they are alway soaking and need to be washed, who has time for this?As far as gas and colic is concerned, which my baby suffers from, I see no difference between Dr Brown's and Avent. I have been using Avent for a few weeks now and I even think my baby has less gases. The COLIC, by the way, STOPPED immeddiatley after I changed by babie's formula To GOOD START, I think they are the BEST!!!!!"
5,Wonderful,"We have a baby with reflux and these bottles work wonderfully with him. Granted, there are a few extra parts to clean, but they are well worth it. We have not had the leaking problems that we have had with the Avent bottles and they can be warmed in a bottle warmer, unlike the VentAire. Also, the tall narrow bottles can attach directly to a Medela or Ameda breastpump. We have used both the tall narrow and short wide bottles with success."
4,great bottles,"These bottles are great. I've been using them for a month and my daughter is a pro. She was born 5 weeks early and has had no difficulty with the flow of the regular sized nipples and she doesn't get confused since she is mainly breast fed. The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is only because the bottles are somewhat annoying to clean by hand. There are many parts to this system. I do put them in the dishwasher, which makes things much easier, but you need a good supply of bottles then."
3,Narrow mouthed bottles- did not work for us,"I bought these to help reduce gas. I really like the fact that they hook up directly to my breast pump; however, my son did not like the narrow mouthed bottles. When he latched onto the narrow nipple, his lips hit the plastic ring/cap of the bottle. He may have done fine on the wide-mouthed bottle, but we just used the platex bottles we already had at home. He accepted the platex natural latch nipples much easier.The concept of these bottles is really great- a bit cumbersome to clean, but really good concept. Wide mouthed would probably be better than narrow, but with most bottles and pacifiers you will just have to figure out what features are most important to you and see what your baby will accept."
2,Not worth the effort if you breastfeed,"I bought one of the 4 oz bottles to try for my breast milk so my husband could feed our son. Our son had gas and spit up alot and we found the Avent bottles the best for him along with gas drops. My biggest complaint is how the screw cap attaches to the bottle as when you shake the bottle without the inside parts- the inner cap moves and milk goes everywhere. Maybe not a problem if you make formula and use right away with parts in place but when you put your breast milk in it for future use, I did not want to put all the parts together as breast milk separates. I also found it too long to clean and think that the idea is good but needs a bit more improvement."
2,Didn't work after a few more tries...,"After using these bottles and trying to see the benefit in them, it still hasn't proved it's worth. I didn't mind cleaning them an extra few seconds, if only they had worked for my baby!With all the contraptions it comes with, you would think it works. I'm pretty sure there are other babies out there who have benefited from these and I'm happy for them, but I just was not happy that they still gave my son some violent gas pains! I have since switched to a simpler form of basically the same thing, and that is the Ventaire bottle! It has worked wonders for my son! I am disappointed that the Dr Browns bottles didn't work for us, wish they had..."
5,The Best Bottle on the Market,"I read the other reviews on this site, and decided to purchase this item for my sister, who is breast feeding. She has used some bottles at times. She told me that this bottle was the absolute best bottle that she has ever seen. The flow is much more natural -- and as complicated as it looked to begin with, that it was the very best. A+ to Dr. Brown."
2,Would be good but nipples are too fast!,"I think this is a great concept that just did not work for us. My little girl is three weeks old and the stage one nipples are just too fast for her. She drank so quickly that she ended up spitting up entire feedings! Obviously, this is NOT the idea.We are back to using the Platex nursers with the drop in liners and they work better for us. I think these would be great if your baby can handle the faster nipple."
1,I don't get it?,"When my baby first came home from hospital I tried the Avent bottle. She was very fussy during feeding and had too much gas.I then went to the old fashioned playtex with the disposable bags. Much better peaceful feeding and less gas.I thought Dr. Brown's bottles would be even better for the gas but, when I tried it the baby was again fussing during feedings and wore half of the formula. I have to admit it did cut down on the gas but, my baby was fussing and so unhappy with this bottle that I went back to the playtex."
2,LEAKY,"I am a first time mother so maybe I am doing something wrong, but these bottles leak terribly. I have tried everything and still no luck. I breastfeed and cannot afford to waste breastmilk! Everytime I turn the bottle upside down, as if I am going to feed my son, and then turn it back to the upright position, milk leaks out. A LOT OF MILK! Is there anyone out there that can offer any suggestions, before I try another brand?Thanks!"
5,Best Bottle Around,"I went through several different bottles with my son and this is the only one that worked. He was very colicky when he was born and I just didn't know what to do, until I tried these bottles. He stopped fussing and crying during feeding time. Sometimes I couldn't even take the bottle out to burp him, he wanted to keep eating until the bottle was empty."
2,LEAKS!,These bottles leak like crazy if you tighten them too much or not enough. It takes FOREVER to clean the zillion parts to each bottle. Not worth it.
1,hate them!!,"I purchased these bottles after reading all the great reviews on them... I was greatly disappointed!!! First of all, they are a pain to clean!!! There are 6 parts to them and you need 2 different brushes to clean them with!! Second, they seem to leak, at first I thought maybe I had a bad bottle....but soon they all started to leak (I bought 8). Third, my poor baby had the worst gas problems! I changed the bottles to Avent and the gas ended!! So if you still want to try them, I suggest you only by a few and not WASTE your money like I did."
1,Beware if you use dishwasher,"Do not use these bottles if you use dishwasher to clean them. These bottles have too many little parts and the dishwasher does not clean them well. We bought a brandnew dishwasher with sanitize option just for the baby's bottles. My baby have strange rash on his face immediately after feeding sometimes, we finally traced the problem to the soap on the bottle. Unless you wash yours with hand and rinse them many times, DO NOT use these bottles. Also, it did not help with gas and split up, we own 24 of these bottles, and decided to switch to Avent. No more rash, and much less gas!!"
1,"Doesn't worth the time, money and effort","Problems: It leaks like crazy. Even if you don't shake it, it leaks sometimes when you have it upside down during feeding. Not to mention if it's not upright in your diaper bag. It's impossible to use it in a normal way if you use formula. Then, all those different parts require soooo much attention when cleaning. Oh, one more thing--make sure milk don't accidentally cover the inner tube during feeding!!?Avent's VentAire on the other hand has an elegant design and excellent quality. It does everything Dr Brown claims to do, without all the trouble. Not to mention Dr Brown's bottles are among the most expensive.Just DOESN'T WORTH it."
1,Don't get these,"I would never buy these. Who wants to do all that intricate cleaning when you have a newborn? I bought the MAM Ultivent Bottles. They have the same nipples as the pacifiers, so they are orthodontically great. And they totally come apart, even the bottom comes off, so they are a breeze to clean. And my baby who spits up alot, doesn't spit up at all anymore. No more wearing a bib all day! They are found at www.babywise.com. They're great."
1,Unfair to Consumer,"I actually find that these bottles are quite helpful in reducing the gas that my babies get during feeding. My problem lies with the Dr. Browns company. These bottles require an additional bottle brush in order to clean the tiny components inside the bottles. They are kind enough to provide you with one tiny brush in the package of 3 bottles. This is a problem because the brushes only last a few weeks at best then you must buy more from the company. I believe that they should be free and this should be brought to the consumers attention at time of purchase. Believe me, at .50 per brush, it will add up by the time the child ends bottle feeding!!Mom 0f 3"
2,Dont let the picture fool you!!!,"As you can see in the picture the bottles are (supposed) to be clear and NOT the BPA free ones. I ordered these because I wanted the ones that are not BPA free. I wanted them to be completly clear. When I recieved them I was sad to see that they were the BPA free kind. If I wanted the BPA free ones I would have order them for $7 cheaper per pack..needless to say I am getting a refund. But apparently Dr. Browns doesnt make the clear (non BPA free) ones anymore :( So I suppose I will have to get the BPA free kind, but at least I will be getting them cheaper then this."
1,HATE THESE BOTTLES,I absolutly hated these bottles they leak and they have too many pieces. The leaking is what drove me nuts. Dont waste your money on these I would recomend the playtex nursers they are awsome!
1,Beware,"this is great if you have ample time to hand wash and boil these bottle parts. the inner pieces are a perfect breeding ground for germs and bacteria since it is so difficult to wash. also, we've had to change nipples constantly since the silicone is so thin and the hold widens quickly with use. the instrux also indicate that you should not boil it for more than 3 mins or it can damage the nipple??!! it also does not indicate that you can boil numerous times- -since it states that you shouldn't boil it past 3 mins, i'm assuming that you aren't supposed to boil it more than once or else the silicone will disintegrate?! the unfortunate thing is that my baby is so used to this bottle system, i'm stuck using it."
5,"These are great! And, NO, they dont leak....","Our son was diagnosed w/ bad reflux. Our Dr suggested we try these bottles as I transitioned from breastfeeding. I already had another brand which we tried with bad results. We tried these and they really do seem to reduce gas! He adjusted to them very easily.Also, I noticed a (bad) review where the mom stated that these bottles leaked a lot in her diaperbag. I'm pretty sure she forgot to insert the ""disk"" under the nipple to block the liquid from entering the nipple. You'll see what I mean when you buy the bottles. I didnt realize that's what the ""travel/transport"" disks were for at first either and even threw 1 away. But, they do work great- we dont get any leaks at all!"
2,Way too fast,"We were having problems with spit-up/reflux and gas with my 1-month old, so I researched bottles and found these. I was very hopeful after reading all the reviews, but the very first time we tried to use them, my son projectile vomited everything I had just fed him. He had taken the formula entirely too fast. I kept trying, but we had the same results each time. The nipple was allowing him to empty the bottle too quickly - and it was a Stage 1 newborn nipple! We have since gone back to the Playtex nurser and are having better luck. (I also switched to a formula for reflux) I am planning on trying these bottles when he gets a little older - he may be able to handle the quick flow then."
5,Not so hard to clean. . .,"I'm a first time mom, and I really did my research to find the best bottles for my newborn son. I got the 4 oz. and 8 oz. bottles, and we love them. My son has no problems eating from these bottles, and he seems to have very little gas during feedings. We have found that using several dishwasher caddies enables us to separate each part in the dishwasher's top shelf for simple cleaning -- we just put the tubes in upside down. We run the dishwasher twice a day, full of bottles, but it's worth it to keep my baby happy and relatively gas-free."
5,Life Savers!,"We love Dr. Brown's bottles! My son has reflux too and has much less of a problem when we use these bottles. We have tried others in the past and there is a noticeable difference. You can tell immediately if someone uses the wrong bottle for him. He'll scream in pain from all the gas and reflux. I was concerned with the inserts when we started adding rice cereal to his formula, but with the Y cut nipples, there's no problem. I don't think the pieces are much of a pain at all. And for those of you who don't wash your bottles within 12 hours, shame on you!! The least you should do is rinse them out after use!"
1,Scientifically Designed to Take Away Your Money,"Thank heaven we didn't pay for these! They were a gift from my brother-in-law, who was taken in by the wild claims that they would reduce gas and reflux. According to our pediatrician, nothing will reduce gas and reflux except getting older, and, unsurprisingly, these bottles work about the same as the el-cheapo Gerbers we bought for the formula supplements. The only advantage I can see is all the extra parts I get to wash--keeps me busy anyway.The only reason we keep using them is because they fit the orthondotic nipples we're using while the Avents (recommended by the hospital) don't, and hey--they were free. We haven't have the problem with leaking that so many reviewers mention, but my wife and I both play string instruments. With the resulting grips of steel we can twist the little caps on within an inch of their lives.My recommendation? Spend the money on a safe car seat and buy the cheap bottles."
1,This a bad bottles,I hated these bottles. There are too many parts to clean for starters and they leak. You can't make-up your formula in the bottle because you can't shake these bottles. They leask all over your baby if you do. I hated them so much I throw them out and bought much cheaper evenflo ones. The work much better.
1,nipple made her gage,"maybe it was just my daughter, who went months being force fed, (I tried every bottle made praying for a solution,) but The DR. brown bottles just made her gag and through up any thing that I had forced in to her. the thing that worked the best for me were the platex nurser bottles. That is my recomondation for any one whos baby is tough to feed. (later after going through early intervention for a feeding aversion) i switched to gerber regular bottles they are great for an older baby. I think that the dr. brown bottles are the worst bottles I tried though!"
2,not so gr ea t,"My triplets seem to have different feeding problems: spitting up and GAS mostly. We had been using AVENT, but had heard Dr. Browns bottles were incredible. Sadly, I must admit I cannot tell any difference. In addition, Dr. B bottles have more parts to clean."
2,Couldn't Go With the Flow...,"I tried the Dr. Brown system but was unsatisfied for several reasons. First of all, the bottles flowed too fast causing my son to choke and gag with every couple of swallows. Not surprisingly, this led to terrible gas and spitting up every time we fed.Secondly, I think these bottles are overpriced. Even if they had worked for me, I would have been hard pressed to spend all that extra money. Bottle feeding is not rocket science and no mother should have to pay that much to feed her child successfully.Finally, although the wide-neck bottles may be a little easier to clean, they also come with more parts than standard bottles, so it all evens out anyway. Additionally, I found the big Dr. Brown's bottles (8-9 oz size) to be very cumbersome, especially when storing them in the fridge or in a diaper bag.Every baby is different and you've got to pick the system that works best for the both of you. For our particular situation, Dr. Brown's was not the answer."
2,she must be the only baby....,that would actually spit up MORE with dr brown's bottles... i got them because of the rave reviews not because she needed anything special... she had been using gerber bottles.... she never spit up and was a good burper.... started with dr browns and she would spit up A LOT... it almost scared me a few times.... went back to gerber and no spit up!!!! i guess they are not for every baby...
2,Wish they had worked,"After reading so many wonderful reviews, I was excited to try Dr. Brown's bottles. Unfortunately, they did little to nothing to relive his colic. I bought 9 bottles and solely used them for about 2 weeks, with no improvement. There is nothing wrong with the bottles themselves, but they are time consuming to clean so I discontinued use. Also, I thought later on I might just use them as regular bottles, however they leak if they do not have the ventilation system in them."
5,Absolutely a Must Have,"These bottles are just the best on the market. Our daughter has used these bottles since she was 5 months old (she is now 14 months) and she just had her first ear infection! Dr Browns bottles really do prevent all the extra gas that can really upset your baby and ear infections as well. I have highly recommended these bottles to my sister and many friends who have had fussy, gasy babies and every singal one of them now raves about them as well. Both they and their babies are resting better. What a great baby gift! I would not buy any other bottle! That is the bottom line."
3,Buy one first to see if you like it.,"This bottle worked just fine for us, but there are so many parts it's a nuisance to clean. I think the Playtex ventairs actually reduce burping better."
5,Will only recommend Dr. Browns to my friends...,"We switched from Avent to Dr. Brown's when our baby was about 4 weeks old. What a difference! We noticed immediately that our baby was less fussy, and these don't drip all over him like the Avent bottles. The extra parts are a hassle to wash, but it's well worth my time if it means having a happier baby."
4,Dr. Browns have helped,"These bottles are my overall preference my daughter will not take any other kind without dispute. We started on the Playtex Ventaire, but she didn't like the shape or texture. So, i found these, and she loves them. We never have any problem burping her. These are just a wonderful blessing."
3,"Good, but too many parts.","These work well for preventing spit up and air in baby's tummy. But there are too many parts to clean and put together just for a bottle. If you don't mind that, then these are a good choice."
4,Great to keep bubbles from being sucked,I like using this bottle than all other regular bottles because it doesn't form bubbles from baby's sucking. It just takes a little more work assembling and cleaning this specialized bottle. More good things: it comes with a little brush to clean the tube and it comes with discs to cover or prevent spilling when you are carrying the bottle in your bag.
2,Too leaky!,These bottles did help my daughter with her gas and such BUT-They leaked everywhere!! My parents and the day care complained about them so I had had enough! Plus...there are extra parts to clean out which might be a hassle. So we tried the Playtex Ventaire and WE LOVE THEM!!!
4,Good Product,Nice ProductI needed a thicker cord other than that it was fine. I used it to make the Shamballa Bracelets.
1,Virtually Useless,"There is lots of prose, and Hundreds of mostly useless tables. I got almost no usable information out of this book. For instance, I foolishly expected the chapter on using NaturallySpeaking with physical disabilities to contain some sort of insights on approaches or macros to use for various types of disability. Instead, the chapter largely consists of a list of websites for various accessibility-related business concerns.The manuals that already come with the product are much more informative than this book."
4,good for office work,"I get this lcd with 2 dead pixels. I want to return and get a new one, but Sony claims that they cannot guarantee the new lcd would not have any dead pixels. I think I will stay with what I have because it seems like a few dead pixels is common in the manufacturing process. The overall quality is good;however, for games with lots of fast actions it would not be the lcd you want to get. For slow moving games such as strategy games it would be ok. I don't recommend that you get this monitor at the retail price though."
5,Just Great Music,This album may be called Sousa 2 but it is certainly not second to anyalbum. I love all the discs in this series by the US Marine Band. While Sousa original is agreat album I think I like this one even better. In this album you get moredeeply into the Sousa catalog. It has songs that fewer people know about anddespite this are especially good. If you are a fan of ole JP Sousa youshould just get the whole set of 4 but if you are looking for a good albumto start off with this one is great. - To check out the whole set see : ABox of SousaA Box of Sousa
2,Unfortunately this is not your 1990's food processor...,"My 20+ year old Cuisinart Food Processor broke right before the holidays. Until the day it broke it was reliable and did every job with ease. Since I don't use a food processor that often I decided to buy the Pro Classic. Over the holidays I used it to mix biscuit dough and chop vegetables and chocolate. Even though it did not seem as sturdy as my old Cuisinart, it worked fine. Then yesterday I used it to puree some vegetable soup. The bowl was just over half full and as soon as I turned it on the Cuisinart started leaking. I stopped it, removed the lid, cleaned it, and locked the lid on. As the lid locked on I noticed that the bowl bowed out on one side, causing the leak. In over 20+ years of use my old Cuisinart never leaked, even when filled to the top. What a disappointment. Too bad this Cuisinart Pro Classic is just another sub-standard ""Made in China"" product."
1,Hard to Clean,"I received this as a gift to replace an older food processor that I purchased for $5 at a yard sale. I was excited to upgrade to a larger capacity model with more power, but I have been very disappointed. This food processor is heavy, somewhat complicated to put together and take apart, and nearly impossible to clean. There are many nooks that get food in them, and are impossible to reach with a sponge.I have also had a lot of problems with the food processor leaking when I'm pureeing soups and sauces.If my old food processor still worked I would go back to using it, and sell this one at a garage sale for $5."
3,clumsy to use,"It had all the features I wanted and it looked great. It definately had the power to do the job. But, I found it to be clumsy to use, extremely messy, irritating in the way you had to pull this, push that, click this, and lock this."
2,Don't really care for this Processor,After using this for one month The Pusher to push the vegetables down kept hitting the blade and the last time I used it the blade is stuck with potatoes in the bottom and I have tried everything and the blade will not come off. So 90 some dollars down the drain.
1,Stopped working after first try,"I bought this Food processor for my mom. In the box, it kept saying to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, and we did. We even watched the instructional DVD that came with it. After following the instructions, my mom tried it out by shredding a cabbage. It worked fine. But after that, the motor just died completely. We looked up the troubleshoot for it but nothing solved our problem. We even plugged it in on a different outlet, but still didn't work... I'm not sure if it has something to do with the shipping and handling that caused it to be defective, but man... I am really disappointed."
5,christmas present,this product had good reviews so i decided to get this one for my wife so she dosent have to cut by hand any more
4,Ok but tricky to use,I have had many food processors. This one kind of smallish compared to my others and this limits what you can put into it. Very good price but this one harder to use than my Cusinart.
5,Kitchen wonderland,"If you have the space for this baby, it will be your best friend. With this product you can cook a dinner for 100 vegetarians and still have time for a pedicure. Cleaning them is a bit of a pain... but with the time it saved you from peeling and slicing, it's a small price to pay."
4,Mom's Gift,I gave this to my mother for Christmas. I have one just like it and love it. I have a few problems putting it to work because I can't remember what goes where sometimes and I am sure she will have the same problem but makes canning items lots easier.
5,a gift,gave this to my sister as a wedding gift because I have been using one for 30 years. I know she will use it a lot.
3,User's manual,"I replaced an old processor that came with a two page instruction book. It did just what the new one does. HOWEVER this one requires a huge book of instructions that are ambiguous or missing PLUS a DVD to use it. Too many safety features that are a big nuisance. If you don't know enough to keep your fingers out of the way, stay out of the kitchen."
3,Cuisinart DLC-10 S 7 Cup,The overall performance is good but the components and the way they attach seem prone to easy breakage.The mechanical pressure plastic levers seem quite fragile.Less durable then I expected
2,Great looking product but.................,"Everything looks great and works well. The only problem is, you have to put all the accessory on it to make it work. The processor will not start chopping unless all the accessory is latch perfectly. I understand it's a protection mechnism to not let your finger get chopped off, but this also means that I will have a hard time dripping olive oil into the little hole and more things to wash. Especially when the top attachment which contains two parts cannot be seperated, it is hard to wash it clean. It will not be as easy as you see on tv, you can't just put on two part and start chopping, you have to put on all the parts."
5,A must in the kitchen,This has cut the time for preparing everything from biscuits to vegetables. I love having it around because it saves me time in prepping vegetables. I can make biscuits in less than 10 minutes because it will do all the 'cutting in' the butter for me and the pulse option gives me complete control.
4,love this little processor,"I really like this processor for the price. One difference between a more expensive one is that the feeder tube is located in the front instead of the back, and the locking mechanism is a little cheap, not sure if it will take years of wear and tear I have in store for it. Other than that it's fine for now. Carrie"
5,The food processor to own,"Does all I expected and more, a true value, all others I looked at don't come with attachments like this one. Cuisinart is the best."
3,where is my DVD?,"Both the site and the product's packaging refer to an instructional DVD. This, I suppose, is meant to be the up-market version of an instruction manual. However, no such DVD was included. I don't know if it was Cuisinart's or Amazon's fault; I do know that it annoyed me."
3,Be wary,"Be wary if considering some of these ridiculously glowing reviews as a basis for buying this product. If the reviewer has never posted a review of any other product yet make over-the-top statements about this product, they may very likely be shills for company."
1,Was hoping for more than I got,"The product information said the cutters were compatable with other cuisinarts, however my old cutter were to big for the bowl. If I had known that, I wouldn't have purchased it."
2,too speed,"hi,its good device but we cud not get this working.. quite complicated .. i wish only one blade made all the choping, shredding ,scling etc..and the motot speed was too high to control to get the desred consistency ! we are trying out to return this product !"
5,Awesome!,"This is a great product! It is very well-designed. I had bought a lesser-priced, other brand named machine and it was crap and a had very bad design. Cuisinart is the way to go for ease, satisfaction and excellent dishes every time. It washes easily (the crap machine I bought had odd nooks and crannies where food would linger and I was never able to get it out). This item is a deal at it's current price. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
4,Cusinard Pro classic,"I really , really , really like this food processor. It is a great time saver and has brought my cooking to a new level because who has a lot of time these days... Clean up is a unbelievably easy. Now I want to cook all the time! I actually go out of my way to find recipes that include lots of ingredients requiring chopping, slicing, dicing and grating. Before I used to avoid these types of recipes because I couldn't stand having to do all the prep work. This is the best thing I have bought myself in a long time. I can't believe it has taken me so long to buy a food processor. I think this is the best food processor - it's very easy to use, the instruction book & video are clear and understandable. While I'm sure the bigger, fancier processors can do a lot more, this one is perfect for me since it is easy to clean, simple to understand and easy to use."
5,Why did I wait so long?!,"I had been putting off buying a food processor because of the cost, but finally decided the time was right. I did a lot of research online and determined from the reviews I've read that I wanted a Cuisinart. This little jewel has been wonderful! I can't believe I waited so long to buy it! It runs quietly and take care of every task fast! I especially love it for making homemade salsa or pico de gallo. One container and hardly any mess. I didn't find it hard to clean at all, contrary to some reviews. As long as you get to it before food has dried on it, it washes right up. I really recommend this food processor if you're in the market for one."
5,Finally have the right tool!,"I had a small food processor, like $20 from target or something, and I struggled with it for a couple of years before I finally decided to break down and buy the fancy one. And I'm glad I did! Its so easy to make hummus, all I do is dump all the ingredients in and turn it on! Its also very easy to chop or shred veggies. I like all the different attachments/disks to do different jobs too."
4,chop chop,"Small, easy to use, easy to store food processor.Certainly too small to process large batches but ideal for smaller projects.Used this machine to mix a lard pie crust as well as cookie dough...worked very well."
3,This was smaller than hoped for.,"I ordered this food processor to replace a DCL 7 that I had purchased about 25 years ago, which was rated as a 7 cup model. When I received this, it was half the size. Turns out I needed the 14 cup food processor. I returned this one and ordered the 14 cup model, which worked out great. All the accessories for the DLC 7 fit the 14 cup food processor. The DLC 7 still worked great, but the cover was getting very hard to lock into position. Needed to be muscled into position to make it run. Really like the new cover design. Amazon was great about returning the 7 cup model. Very happy."
5,terrific food processor!,"For 16 years I used another brand name food processor because my husbnd is....well...frugal??? It finally died after falling apart and I got my new cuisinart. It is like dying and going to heaven. I love everything about it! I love the size, the features, the divine capabilities. I keep it on my counter always because it is so versitile and easy to clean and reuse! Thank you, Cuisineart!!!!"
4,Cuisinart 7 cup food processor,"This is a very handy resource to have in your kitchen. Then only thing that I would recommend different would be that if you think you need a bigger one, get it."
5,Tulsa gal,"I am not much of a chef but I love this machine. I makes easy work of cooking. Cleans up easily. If you buy this product I would suggest buying holder for the blades at the same time. Also, if you fix large meals, get the larger one.Great machine."
5,Grrreat!,Got this for my 73 year old wife for Christmas and she is completely enamored with it. She watched the accompanying DVD video and immediately set out on a grocery shopping spree and began to use this fantastic machine. She is starting to make things that she never visualized before and I am delighted with the results.Thank you Cuisinart and thank you Amazon.
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,"I have owned this model Cuisinart (which I bought for substantially more) since 1983. Today, Thanksgiving day 2007 I made 40 Carrot cakes using this machine - and it still works as strong as the day it was bought. My son mentioned buying a food processor as a gift - this is the only one I would suggest he buy. GET IT!"
5,Cuisinart 7 cup food processor,Other than what I consider a design flaw with the plunger (cannot completely take apart for cleaning) this product is wonderful. Great value.
5,Processor,Good processor for the dollar value. Size is more universal than alot so you can do small and moderate processing without two machines.
5,CUISINART,"THIS IS A FABULOUS PRODUCT, EASY TO USE & CLEAN UP IS SO FAST. I GIVE IT 10 STARS ALL THE WAY."
4,Cuisinart DLC 10S Pro,Our 25 + year old Cuisinart died and we had to replace it. We really like the new design of the top to the container. The new design allows for much easier filling and cleaning. One draw back... it could be more powerful.
5,"Awesome service,",Fastest service I have ever had. The unit came in as advertised and in great shape. Can't ask for more.
3,Is it me or the Processor?,Can't warm up to the product. Might take some time to figure out how to work with it. Might change my review after more treys.
3,Kind of overrated,Don't get me wrong. This is an excellent food processor and worked great. At the same time it is almost always easier and more effective to use one of those hand held food processor. My wife who would use this the most has pretty much stopped using this all together and we'll probably give it away or sell it to free up some shelf space.
4,Cuisinart DLC-10S Pro Classic 7 Cup,Machine works great but the lid does not fit well. It seens to be out of round
3,does not cube well,I needed something to help me cube veggies and fruit. Using this on apples it turned them into mush. Also tried it on nuts. It turned them into mush also. It is a very nice addition to the kitchen and I'm sure I'll find lots of uses but just not to cube things.
2,don't understand,I was excited to get my food processor too. But after trying it I don't understand why the food pusher is attached to the food tube?? Can someone at Cuisinart tell me how I am suppose to get the food into the bowl if you can't put it through the food shoot? I am considering returning this item for this reason and maybe looking at some other units.
4,Cuisinart DLC-10S Pro Classic 7 Cup Food Processor,"It works quite well, and I am nearly completely satisfied with it. The only improvement they could make is to make it easier to dry after washing. There are lots of tiny (non-accessible) places for water to go -- and water easily finds these places! But parts will air dry, so just be patient. Other that this, I love my food processor and use it a lot for fresh salads, salsas, cole slaw, and so forth. Thinking about all this has made me hungry, so I will sign off and go fix something healthy to eat. GLL"
5,"Efficient, but lots of plastic and moving parts.","I hate moving parts. I like safety, I like ease of use, I like the way all the parts fit together oh-so-nicely, but the more points of contact between moving parts, the more possibility of breakage or jamming. Takes about 3 uses to fully comprehend the machine. Quite powerful, and very versatile even with the few cutting discs and blades included."
4,Food Processor,"I like the way the Cuisinart chops vegetable, it was easy and quick. It was kind of hard in the beginning understanding the part to slice, but once I understood it worked okay, didn't use it for anything else yet."
2,Blad and Plastic Container broke after 1 year,Excellent machine but not durable. The 7 Cup container is broke and the blade has cracks in its base.I am trying to call the company for replacement on this item.
5,Cuisinart Food Processer (DLC-10S),"This processor gets used every other day on the average. It is reliable and saves me a lot of time. I've heard people complain about cleaning all the parts after using, but it isn't that bad. If you can keep the unit on the counter, so much the better. My folks don't like the way it looks, so they tuck it away in the garage. As a result, they don't use it much. The julian strip blade is a joke; avoid buying this if possible. The french fry blade is not nessary. Just slice with wide blade turn potato 90 degrees and slice again. Enjoy!"
3,Food processor,Once you finally figure out how to put all (too many) of the pieces together it does do a good job I don't often use it so each time is a test of my memory and ingenuity. I find the switch to have a non positive reaction which is a bit difficult to get used to. Very heavy - don't keep it on a lower shelf!
4,VERY HELPFUL IN KITCHEN WORK.,I have purchased this to gift my Daughter on her Birthday. Preparation time gets reduced by using this Food Processor.This is very helpful to the working women. Nice Food Factory. Performance is very good. I will recommend to buy this.Mr. Suresh Desarda.
4,Great multi-use product,"I love using it to make homemade pizza dough. It is so easy, no kneading, the machine does it for you. I also used it to make drop biscuits. They were so light and airy. They were wonderful. I also use it to make ground beef. It grinds it really well and it is really nice to know what goes into your hamburger. The only downside is a little rust on the chopping blade. The parts need to be hand dried and left out to completely air dry. I have 2 toddlers that get into everything so I can't do that. I would buy it again in a heart beat. It is so much cheaper than buying a meat grinder, a chopper, and a bread machine."
5,A fine product so far,"I read the reviews, bought the product and haven't been disappointed so far. It makes my life easier working on those tasks for which one would make the best use of a food processor. It's a bit difficult to clean and dry, but that's a quibble.This was my first food processor -- apart from my knives, graters and hands!"
1,Disappointing,"I have had this food processor for over a year and have rarely used it because it frustrates me every time I try. If I use more than the regular bowl and lid I have to struggle to get it all put together properly. That doesn't even take into account the difficulty in cleaning the parts. Tonight I attempted to grate some fresh cranberries for a salad and discovered that the attachment will no longer engage the safety feature and the processor would not turn on. In attempting to trouble shoot the problem I discovered that he regular cover engages the safety just fine. I haven't used the grater/slicer more than twice and to say I'm disappointed is putting it mildly. I'll use the regular bowl/lid until the thing dies but don't really expect it to take all that long given the fact that a major part of the device has already failed. I bought this brand because I'd heard good things, I won't purchase from this company again."
3,lousy lid,"The food processor works fine. But the lid is difficult to manage and clean. I think it was designed by lawyers who were more concerned about the possibility of a cut finger than chopping or grating food. I'd rather have a Robot Coupe, but for the price this is ok."
5,LOVE IT,I've had this for over a year now and have shown it no mercy. I even used it to grind meat until I received an electric meat grinder as a gift. This is one tough machine and shows no signs of slowing down. I highly recommend this item for anyone who is interested in a first time food processor purchase (I was) or if you're looking to replace an old one.
3,Making friends with a Cuisanart,"This great big cuisanart arrived to replace a little old model I got in the 70s. It seems not only big but a bit complicated to operate...any appliance that needs a DVD to explain itself has a slight problem. However, it works well once you wrangle it into position. I'm beginning to like it alot!"
3,"Crappy Instructions, Otherwise Good",I found the instructions quite cumbersome & it took reading multiple forums online to come up with similar problems. More graphics!!! Less text instructions about parts I've never heard of before!!!
4,Food Processors - too few in red!,"I have Cuisinart's Mini Prep size and love it for chopping but it has no spout to input while running and I want to make my own mayo (in smaller batches than I can buy, so organic won't spoil). I love red, but although the brand shows many colors, they seem to have no models in red. I saw a review on KitchenAid's red one (7-cup) where the handle fills with water and is too fragile. I want to buy a sturdy one and for countertop- want RED! My toaster, Mixer, Blender, ice cream and coffee makers as well as many small items are all bright red in my white and light wood kitchen. Other large things that I have to store, I don't often use because it adds to prep time to pull it out of lower cabinets and set it up. The only one that is worth that effort is my lovely Viante grill!"
3,Item ordered wasn't large enough,We should have ardered a unit with more capacity. All other aspects of the purchase and return were very smooth.
2,Not what I expected,"This processor replaced an inexpensive model that I liked until it died. I hoped that this would be much better due to the cost. It isn't. The blade is too close to the bottom of the container, not allowing food to get in the right position for chopping. So, often, what I'm making (if not liquid in nature) ends up just riding around on top of the blades. I find that I use my blender more often than the processor. The shredding/dicing blades are also not as effective as anticipated. Items seem to become trapped between the lid and the blade with frequency."
5,Great Slaw Maker,I am very please making the choice on this food processor. I been having a desire for some slaw and wanted it made fresh. This processor made everything go so smooth and took less time to make. That was the quickest time ever on making slaw which it is good for other things also. It is the best one I have ever used. You cannot go wrong with this purchase.
4,Gift to Grandson,"My grandson has called and told me the Cuisinart works good, considering he is a first cook. He decided to learn how to prepare some meals and hopefully, his family will enjoy. Wish him luck."
5,If your tired of chopping,I made pickles for the first time this past year and a friend lent me her 30+year old Cuisinart food processor. It ran well the motor still like new and sliced and chopped like a new one. I fell in love with it and knew that I would have to have one. I loved the dvd that came with it. I made 2 repices from it the first day! The meatloaf and Potatoes au Gratin my family loved them both.It doesn't take a lot of counter space which is wonderful too. So if you want a product that is built to last and your tired of chopping this product is for you!
5,Fast shipping and nice machine,"I ordered this product and received it within a couple of days. Impressive since the shipping was free. Seems like a very solid machine with heavy duty motor and sharp blades. I've used it on meats, mixing up flour and butter for pie shells and chopping veggies. Works like a charm!"
2,food processor,"I purchased this as a shower gift for my daughter who lives in Chicago. Recently when visiting, we had occasion to use it. It is NOT at all like the one I had ordered for another daughter at Christmastime even though it is the same brand and same size. This one has a one piece top part which is very, very difficult to clean. Of course, since it is past Amazon's return policy, my daughter will be faced with having to write the company about it. I do NOT recommend it at all."
4,Works well on the Bar-B-Que,This product works well for us when the oven is in use and we need another pizza cooked. We can crank up the grill and grill a pizza to perfection.
4,Over-the-Top Vintage Thriller,"Mummies! Vampires! Magic Beetles! Hypnotism! Bats! A ""Polish Jewess"" Sorceress! (No, I'm not making that up!)This early-20th century thriller packs in loads of deliriously silly supernatural thrills. The writing style is a little dated (this was written around World War I), the characters are all cardboard, and the flaccid ending is a bit of a disappointment, but the action rarely stops and, overall, this is a fun read. Rohmer is best remembered for his Fu Manchu series of books (forerunners of the James Bond series, in a way), but this stand-alone novel, featuring an ancient Egyptian curse at loose in London (with a side trip to Cairo), is quite a good read."
2,Holy Boredom,"About all I can say positive about this book is that the kindle version was free. If you're one of those people who fancy old, black'n'white, silent movies, I guess this book may appeal to you, as that's the best comparison I can think of. The story is one dimensional and plodding, the characters are cutouts, the dialog is stilted and incomplete. It did, at times, get my interest when I felt like I was getting a glimpse into a period piece, but these times were fleeting.Overall, I was bored and skimming."
4,A good supernatural thriller,"Brood of the Witch-Queen, is one action packed novella.Considering the relative small length, you get a ton of horror, death, disgust and all those great things that keep you up late at night.Get the free edition, and keep the lights on. Unless you like grave beetles."
4,Good Read,"I thought it was a good book. Of course it was dated, but it had parts that are timeless. There was alot of mystery and intrigue. Simply put, it was a quick easy read that I enjoyed."
3,Sax Rohmer high melodrama,"Another galloping art deco era blood curdling thriller a la Sax Rohmer. Rohmer is usually a fun read, there are a few clunkers (see my review for the ""Green Eyes of Bast""), but the Fu Manchu and the other ""yellow peril"" novels are delightful period pieces of adventure for those not so politically correct to let it stand in the way of a good story. Often the men are British moral prigs (no other word captures this quality-sorry). Fighting like any stout & bold Englishman, the dark ancient Egyptian demonic forces unleashed by a depraved antiquarian in this work.Rohmer is a master of creating atmosphere & environment in his books. A contemporary of Rohmer's who fits the same bill is Algernon Blackwood. I assure you that Rohmer is as good as most ""Mystery"" series offerings on PBS. If the above appeals to you on some level- then ""Brood of the Witch Queen"" is your cup of tea."
2,Just because it's old doesn't mean it's good,"Fairly interesting story. Not nearly up to horror standards of today, but it had its moments. Due to this being written in London in the early 1900s, the language can be difficult to follow at times.I would have given this 3 stars, but the ending was like a Steven King ending - no idea how it should really end so just do something stupid."
3,cant find drivers!,"at first sight, this controller looks great. it's buttons are exactly like a playstation controller. then i found out there were no drivers for it. so if anyone knows where to find the drivers for this controller, PLEASE email me at: MMT1087@cs.com"
2,"Not enough, and why so many turbos?","Well I don't have it, but a couple friends bought piranhas over a year ago. I'd rather have the Gravis GamePad Pro, which has 8 buttons for 8 different functions. Besides, serial-like connection is kinda out of date."
2,DCA Star,"First thing is 1st, it only really has 4 buttons. Those top 4 are turbo buttons. THEY AREN'T SEPARATE!! Installation was shakey... Spend the extra $10 and go get the Gravis... it's the closest thing to the playstation controller that you'll be able to find. If you want $40 will get you the Xterminator by Gravis... That by far is 3 controllers in 1 !!"
1,DRIVERS????????,"I guess I am not along when i say i would really like to rate this game pad, but can not use it. it seems i need the driver to run it on my windows98 system. I have tried all the trouble shooting and my game port works just fine when i plug in my Gravis flight stick but does not recognize the game pad. does anyone know where to get drivers for this thing?"
1,piranah pad pc propad 4,"i have owned this controler for 6 months, i can`t use it because i have no drivers? to run it in my system! thankyou!"
4,Cute but....,"I bought it on a super sale, but I don't think the quality is good enough for a tommy product, the coral color have come off"
4,A Great Book,"Just received this book. Very inspiring and full of information and ""templates"" that make it easy to set up a pose and produce some wonderful looking outfits. I was eager to start drawing the moment i opened it. My only problem with it, is that there is no color renderings of any of the fabrics. I'm sure that would have knocked the price up quite a bit, however, seeing the fabrics rendered completely in color would have been a great benefit, and occassionally some of the models are not copied thoroughly enough, so you miss one or two details here and there, but it still blows away a lot of other fashion books i have come across. ... it's worth it!"
3,Not bad for the money could be better,this book isn't a bad illustration book if you already know how to draw fashion but its not a good book for beginners I would suggest buying the book Fashion Sketchbook first then maybe 9 heads and then this one. This book is best used if you're a seasoned illustrator.
4,incredibly flat response unlike others in its class,"I was at the MacWorld trade show this week and noticed how many horrible sounding small computer speakers (with subwoofer) are out on the market for both your computer and your iPod.The Tascam booth had a refreshing sound from these speakers...no heightened upper midrange that gives music a bad sounding digital ""CRRunch"". These were smooth and flat. I've been looking for a pair ever since hearing them at the booth...and that's with a LOT of competing ambient noise. I can't wait to hear them in my quiet apartment."
4,Awesome...,"I love the sound quality, style, construction, and feel of these. The quality is solid. I bought them when working with Apple Logic Pro for a course I was taking.I do not like that the only adjustment is located on the back of the subwoofer.These are better suited to musicians (or those who are looking for clarity and precision in the sound) than to those who are looking for something LOUD."
1,not happy,"I am very disappointed with this item. I ordered a 2-button serial mouse and got a 3-button mouse that did not work with my older equipment. Since this mouse was under $10 it was not worth sending back. I found a 2-button Microsoft mouse from another vendor that worked perfectly. I noticed the Micro Innovations PD29B pictured here, even though it reads 2-button is a 3-button. very disappointed."
1,Never received item,This Item was never received and when I contacted Costume Craze they gave me the UPS code and did nothing further to locate the missing item. I will never buy anything from them again and I hope that Amazon reveiews the poeple in which they do business with. All items taht I have bought thru Amazon has been done so with excellent service. your affiliate Costume Craze was not.
2,"Okay, I guess","Well, I have never been too impressed with this atlas. I fell in love with the beautiful Benchmark & rarely look back. The dirt roads in Delorme look like hiking trails, the book splits California into 2 sections, paper is weak quality. It will do in a pinch, but I would rather have my 'REAL map book'."
2,I do not recommend,"I am a law enforcement officer in a very large city. As the supervisor of the intelligence and terrorism unit, I was hoping to gain insight based on the title of the book. However, the title is misleading as the content relates mostly to studies that have nothing to do with improving future operational capabilities."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,"I bought this toy for my daughter thinking it would be a fun alternative to the ""classic"" stackers. The packaging is horrible when I recieved it it was almost out of battery. The balls barely pop, and it has a musical song which I love cause she loves, but its covered by this loud horrible sound that the stacker makes to pop the balls a 1/4 inch!!!! This is really, really cheap toy and I do not reccoment it!!"
4,My Favorite Set,"These two are the most frequently used pots in my kitchen and they've been great! They're big enough to hold several servings of pasta. The best part is that they clean up easily since the handles are attached as smooth welds. I've had other pasta sets with rivets that made it difficult to remove all the starch. These two clean up with a quick wash. One puzzlement is that the instructions said that the pot heats quickly so use med-hi heat, but my observation is that it doesn't heat all the quickly on an electric range. Using high heat did mar the interior finish on the pot though, so I'd recommend limiting heat to med-high."
3,Poor Design Lets It Down,"The ""outside"" pot and lid are fine. However, until you get used to remembering to fill the outside pot with the insert in place to insure that it won't overflow, you'll have boiled-over starchy water all over the stove. The height of the insert is very deceiving--the holes are practically up to the very top of the outside pot. Fill the outside pot with the inset in place ONLY up to the second row of holes."
4,"Excellent mood stabilizer, non drowsy","I was quitting smoking and needed to stabilize my mood. Works pretty well, at least when giving up marijuana to keep mood stable and elevated. Also suggest exercise and good food to assist in a detox situation.I've had experience with Zoloft and other meds going back 10 years or more, never took them long term because I didn't like the SSRI side effects and MJ smoking used to help calm down my stress, but became a negative after long-term steady use...5-HTP + St. John's Wort = good healthy stuff."
3,On the fence,"I took this product for a month. It was easy to swallow, it did have an odor but not so bad that I couldn't take it. I just didn't notice any real improvement that this product would have responsible for. But as with anything your experience may be different."
1,Ehhh,"Thought this would take the 'edge' off, but it didn't, but to be fair I didn't give it an extended testing of 30 days or more to metabilize into my sys. Who knows, maybe it'll work for someone else. Doesn't seem to have any effect at all. Wasn't for me. On the expensive side too."
2,i dont even know how to rate this because i didnt notice any difference..,"i take alot of supplements for fibromyalgia, anxiety and depression and i saw all the great reviews on this and thought i would give it a try since im so anxious all the time and am sick of taking xanex..not sure how long im supposed to wait to notice effects- weeks? months? it doesnt say.. people are acting like it was an immediate difference but i didnt notice feeling happier or calmer and ive been taking them about a week, so i dont know.. i would say that its great if they work for you but i think im going to return mine."
2,poor choice of script,"this musical comedy has been performed in numerous forms with numerous casts, this is not a good combination of the assets."
1,Not the Original,"Anyone looking for a movie capturing the original Broadway hit Anything Goes (or any of its on or off-Broadway revivals) will be very disappointed with this DVD. The plot has been totally convoluted and looks nothing like the original and a number of the great hit songs are now by Bing Crosby, not leading actresses. Not nearly as funny as the original. And the set and dance choreography is all 1950s. Basically, everything has been redone to capture the feel of another White Christmas production with Bing Crosby in the lead. A real disappointment."
2,Should Have Stuck to the Stage Play,"Anything Goes is a fabulous musical from the stage of the 1930s containing show girls, gangsters, and romance. However, this film version has very little of the above and therefore has only mild entertainment value.Bing Crosby and Donald O'Connor play stage stars, both enjoyable in their own right. They need a female lead for the show, so they split up in search of one. Crosby digs up Mitzi Gaynor and O'Connor finds Zizi Jeanmaire, neither of them expecting the other to find a girl. Herein lies the problem. Both girls believe they will be starring in the show. Steps are taken to let one of the girls down easily, but both men fall in love with the other man's choice of a star.With songs from the original musical peppered throughout, the songs lose their meaning in a different context. The choreography is uninspiring and that singing is not all that great despite the major names featured. This one is a real bomb."
2,Why did they completely rewrite the original story?,"I rented this movie and thought I was seeing a movie version of the original broadway musical. I did not like the movie because the story was weak and silly. Then yesterday I saw the original version at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, SC. I found out that the movie version is a totally different story. The broadway version is exciting and while the story is still not great, it is far superior to the nonsense of the movie. Unless you have to own this movie, I would rent it first.On the plus side is the superior singing of Donald O'Connor, a truly outstanding voice in great form. Mitzi Gaynor also does well and looks great. Bing Crosby is a little past his prime, although still quite good.Normally I can watch great musicals over and over but I finished with this one. I have to thank Winthrop for letting me see the original in what was a truly outstanding production."
2,Utterly Confusing,"This is a writer guide? I didn't fall off the turnip truck yesterday. As a freelance writer and associate instructor at a nearby college, trust me, I know what I'm talking about.This is a jumbled and poorly planned book. Maybe even poorly laid out, but it's kind of hard to tell when the editor of the story doesn't make his purpose of writing the book very clear.If someone handed me the book, without letting me see the title and without telling me what it was about, I'd read it and say that it is a mostly a collection of whiney writers telling about their problems, with a few good erotic stories.If I were to rename this book I think I would go with something like, ""Erotica Writers of America Come out of the Closet""Overpriced, Overhyped by the first couple reviewers, and certainly not a place to look for writing instruction or ideas."
2,It was OK at best,"The reason I've given this 2 stars is because of how terrible the sound quality is. She is OBVIOUSLY singing VERY VERY well, and her voice is PERFECT, but it's so hard to hear her and at some points you can't!The songs and song choices are good, but this simply isn't just worth the money. It's sad that I was so excited for this and spent so much money for it and ended up being SEVERELY disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"I must preface this by saying I am one of the biggest Whitney fans out there. Prior to her drug addiction days, Whitney always sang perfectly and no one (including Mariah Carey and Aretha Franklin) could compare to her.Nonetheless, I am still disappointed by this concert. Whitney's microphone is turned on too low compared to the rest of the music. The overall effect is that her voice barely seeps through the music.This is particularly disappointing because it's clear that Whitney did sing very well in this performance. Indeed, her rendition of ""A song for you"" where the backgroup music is softer shows how spectactular her vocal abilities were. Unfortunately, the rest of the songs are marred by the overbearing background music"
5,Great,"The books arrived ahead of schedule and were well packaged. Conformation was sent by e-mail at evrey step of the shipment, and was handled in a very courteous manner. Thanks guys!!"
5,good for designer,it's a little expensive but it's worthy when i got it. very good book for graphic designer.
3,What's the point of this size?,"This is a portfolio of work that is always interesting and often beautiful. The approach is as stimulating as the work and, sadly, this is where the book is done a great disservice by the size of the type. It is simply too small to read comfortably and seems to invite its dismissal. Everything seems irrelevant- small type not intended to be read because it's not important. It's unnecessary and unforgivable- an elementary folly that made me question the whole book."
2,"This Lamp is OK, with 1 big IF......","This lamp is ok if you are ordering it by itself. I recently ordered one on sale. The reason they are on sale is that they are stained about 3 shades too dark. Its more of a mahogany color than a walnut. If you have the table lamps (like I do), The floor lamp won't match them. If you want a matched set, see them before you buy them (at a Lamps Plus showroom) if possible."
1,Poor quality,"For $400 (plus $60 shipping) this lamp should have been much better quality. I found it to be the usual ""Made in China"" level craftsmanship. The joinery (fit-up of the wood parts) was poor, and the finish was not uniform. What really pissed me off was that the base for the night light section within the pedestal was completely cracked thru. Obviously the shipping people at Lamps Plus are unconscious when they send out products that are damaged. I sent it back."
3,Could definitely use more description,"Since this book was written quite awhile ago, most of the information in this book can be readily found on the Internet these days. However, the table of contents is quite good and if you research each of the topics more closely on the Internet, you will get a deeper understanding. Even when the book was written in 2003, it only gives you a cursory understanding on each topic and you would probably have to consult with an attorney or do your own research if you needed a deeper understanding."
3,Nice Outline But VERY LIGHT On Detail!!!!,"This book will be good if you want to review the components that might make up your wealth protection strategy. However, the book comes up short on the detail needed to understand those components well or to structure a comprehensive plan for yourself.To get a feel for the lack of detail take a look at the Table of Contents, note that it seems very comprehensive but when you look a little closer you will see that most of the chapters are LESS THAN 5 PAGES! The subtopics in each chapter usually make up a single paragraph with a large font bold heading that takes up a lot of the page.In short, if you want to get an overview of the components you might ask your advisor to explain to you, this would be a valuable purchase. If you want to understand these things yourself, you will be disappointed."
3,"What the title promises, but no more","O'Neill turns out a serviceable record of notable bits of China's history from the Stone Age up until the immediately post-Mao era. A long collection of brief articles, this book is not suited to being read all the way through in one sitting; it is meant to be consulted as a reference. It is quite serviceable in that role, though it doesn't really excel. If you were reading a more detailed work, O'Neill's book would be useful as something to consult if the more detailed work didn't explain its references. Its internal cross-referencing could be a little better, but it's not useless. If you have no knowledge of Chinese history, this is not a good place to start - but if you have a little and you're looking for help, this is a bargain. Serious students of Chinese history, though, will probably not find it useful."
2,"Disappointing ""Downtempo""","Being a fan of such ""downtempo"" music as K&D, Tosca, Thievery Corp, etc., I picked up this album based on the glowing reviews I read here at Amazon. Unfortunately, I wasn't into this stuff at all, even after repeated listening attempts. I found this music overly repetitive, uninventive, and ocassionally irritating. Certainly nothing extraordinary here. I ended up selling this CD and don't miss it at all. Be advised."
2,"Good artists, poor remakes","Brazilian music by non-Brazilians usually lacks a certain charm and unfortunately, this CD is anything but an exception. The good thing about this CD was that it tributed Jobim and had excellent musicians and songs like Oleta Adams, Al Jarreau and El Debarge. The problems were the remakes of the songs. For example ""Waters of March"" is very disappointing and even more so annoying-- not Oleta Adams singing style at all. For the time being, stick to the original Jobim/Gilberto/Regina Bossa Nova albums OR try another compilation."
2,Not a Walkman,"It's a shame Sonyericsson decided to mark this phone with the walkman logo as it has the crapiest music playback capabilities i ever seen. I bought this phone cuz i liked the idea of having a cellphone, mp3 player and digital camera in one small device however the music playback has a very anoying hissing noise which makes listening to music at low valume levels almost imposible. If you like blowing your eardrums off you may not notice this but if you preffer to listen to your music at lower levels you will be very disapointed. This is a problem which purtains to every W810 model, sonyericsson is aware of the problem and admitied that they are not atempting to fix it. Don't get me wrong the phone as a phone works well and the 2mpx camera is just okay (you can't expect super images from a lens that small). But if you are looking for a good phone with mp3 playback capabilites there are a lot of better products out there."
5,awesome,"Hey, wow! that is the most important thing about this phone. WOW. one negative is the battery cover. difficult to get off. However, I am so pleased with this product. Music, themes and games are so simple and fun to download to the phone and the sony ericsson web site is great in walking you through all you need to know about the phone. whoohoo."
4,Good Walkman-Phone integration!,"Pros: Excellent sound and environment noise isolation ( far better than Ipod ), easy and fast switch between walkman / phone / radio mode, good screen can be used outdoor with no problem, easy bluetooth configuration, insuperable easy to use PC-Like menus uses tabs for item organization ( calls, contacts, options and so on ) good camera / accesory light, good photo camera quality, acceptable video capture ( yet can't replace any digital camera ) easy in-out Memory Stick dos not need to turn off phone, comes with usb pc cable and 512MB. Supports MP4, 3gp video. Good voice recognition.Cons: keypad must be improved. hard keys, hard joystick ( i have one k300 and a t610 and both have better handling ) , a little confusing camera menu, Poor web browser ( Solved installing opera mini ).Reccomended: Yes. It has all the goodies of the Sony phones, plus walkman with Amazing sound!!"
1,w810i Audio Hiss Warning,"Sony Ericsson has a really great product here. It has everything I wanted. However, there is a well-documented hissing problem with the audio on the Walkman application that I din't discover until I got the phone. This is utterly *ridiculous* for a phone branded with the Walkman label. What's worse Sony Ericsson appears to acknowledge in support requests that there is a problem, yet will not fix it because the hissing was introduced when they fixed (via a firmware update) a sonic distortion problem when volume is cranked up.So, everyone who listens at a normal volume level is out of luck while people who are piercing their ear drums at least do it in crystal-clear audio. Nice. This is a firmware issue that SE refuses to fix, at least for now.SE had a real chance hear to create a killer product. It does a lot of thing really well. Just don't expect it to replace your ipod. Wait for the Apple cell phone. Apply appears to actually take audio seriously, unlike Sony Ericsson."
3,Great phone but...,"I was quite thrilled when I got this unlocked walkman phone. Its' voice call quality is great,music is simply awesome with the stereo headsets that come with the phone, and the phone's battery life is phenomenal. However, the phone drops way too many calls when I am in my apartment. I am with T-mobile and admiteddly, T-mobile coverage here isn't as great as those of other service providers. Nonetheless, my previous phones with T-mobile didn't drop calls whatsoever. But with this phone, I can barely be on a call for 5 minutes.T-Mobile doesn't officially carry this phone, and so help from that quarter wasn't forthcoming. Sony Ericcson webpage doesn't seem to have any software upgrades.Overall , it's an amazing phone,but with such high percentage of dropped calls, I would not recommend this productRam"
1,More Information Required Upfront,"These people need to state upfront, the fact that this phone has no US charger, no instructions in English, is based on the Orange network in Europe, so the additional extensive functions will only work for Orange users. These people are based in NYC, and I'm in California, so there's obviously an integrity issue here. I've seen other Americans say the same thing about other unlocked GSM world phones purchased from this company. I'm sure it's a great phone, but if I can't even charge it/comprehend the instructions if I could/ or use any of the additional dowload/update functions, what good is it?"
2,Used Item Shipped,"The sony ericsson w810i phone that was advertised says it's new, but the phone I recieved via mail was used also there was some picture in the memory card of the phone. It was used and it was in an old box. I was so disappointed.The Vibecellular is good in delivery time not in the product quality. I advice you all not to buy produect from this vendor.[...]"
3,So-so,"The phone has come with the old battery. It was holding only 25% of charge and died after 2 charges. The seller didn't respond to my message. So after waiting for a while I have to buy a replacement OEM battery. The other consideration - the phone is actually a Cingular cell phone and it comes with a lot of software linked to Cingular network. The software can't be uninstalled or removed by firmware reflash. The seller should mention that fact in unit's description! After all the phone is just fine. The battery, seller and firmware are real disappointments."
1,HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT,I PURCHASED THIS PHONE AND IT IS NOT FUNCTIONING. I SENT AN EMAIL WITH MY SITUATION AND HAVE NOT GOTTEN A REPLY. EVERY YEAR I PURCHASE FROM AMAZON AND THIS IS THE FIRST I HAVE EVER RECEIVED SUCH SERVICE. I PAID FOR THIS PHONE AND NOW I AM STUCK WITH IT. UNFORTUNATELY I DID NOT RECEIVE THE PHONE UNTIL AFTER THE RETURN TIME. I AM PRESENTLY NOT IN THE US AND HAD TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE COULD HAVE BROUGHT IT FOR ME. I AM NOW LOOKING FOR A SONY ERICSSON STORE THAT CAN HELP ME TO REPAIR IT. I STILL NEED HELP ON THIS
1,My Choice: 0 stars,"I have always enjoyed movies that have to do with life on the street and anything that deals with the hispanic culture. I usually cant stop a watching a movie until its over,once it starts it will finish. It took five minutes while watching this movie to decide to turn it off,and it wasnt a hard desicion. It looks like a low budget film with poor actors. It looks like they are not even trying. I love movies and this has to be the worst one I have ever seen. Sorry to be blunt but the truth hurts."
3,Not the worst of them.,"It could have been a lil better told & directed. I also think the acting could have been a lil better, but there was good topics & some touching subjects. Got to watch it on youtube, so it's not like I got stuck w/the dvd. It was ok to at least watch once."
1,not happy,"First, the supplier took exception when I advised them the product has issues zipping on the sides and asked me to revoke my opinion... not a problem I did - will NOT buy from them again. I realize they did not make the product, but would have thought if they were selling it, would want know.. Second, the zipper hangs up on the sides INSIDE the bottom section. Would not buy another."
2,"Looks rugged, I wanted to love this","Zipper ripped/came off, fell apart...Looks very rugged, feels heavy duty, this did not see heavy use or abuse at all, lasted maybe a month, then garbage.Seemed damn near impossible to find a lunch bag that was rugged and actually for a man, thought I was set here, see a ton of great reviews, hate to be the guy who throws a bad one in the mix to question things but I don't have a choice. I ended up giving up on ""lunch bags"" after this and took the bladder/tube out of my desert Camelback and it has become my work/lunch bag, turns out it's perfect and Camelbacks are 100% tough as hell, the thing has seen a couple* of wars and a decade of use and severe* abuse, still going strong good as new."
3,Way too big for a school lunch box,Thought it would be good for my middle school son but it really is made for a steelworker - two breaks and lunch. Well-made and very cool but just too big for school. Kept this one and he takes it for skiing - holds snacks and lunch and dinner! For everyday use bought Fugu Lunch Tote. That item works great and has an acceptable middle-school profile.http://www.amazon.com/Built-NY-LB4BLK-Lunch-Tote/dp/B00180LXD4/ref=cm_cr-mr-title
5,"Great, large lunch carrier","This is a great find. I can easily fit a large Glad Tupperware in the chilled bottom section, and include salad dressing, a drink, and a small lunch entree (like a Lean Cuisine). In the top, there is still room for snacks, fruit, crackers - just about anything relatively lightweight that doesn't require the insulation down below. In addition, there is a side mesh zipper for utensils and napkins, or a a sweet dessert like a piece of chocolate or a small bag of almonds. It even has an optional shoulder strap, which I like when I pack up for the day - it makes it easy to balance my meals, my computer bag, my purse, and my usual latte for the commute. Totally happy with this one!"
3,too heavy,"If you are into protecting food from bears (or hungry co-workers not good w/ zippers), this lunch sack is the one for you.I never thought I'd complain that something is TOO durably made, but this lunch sack is overkill. The zippers are massive and the material is way too heavy. The (unnecessary) material added extra weight/bulk that made this too difficult to put inside my (large) backpack with other necessities such as books and a laptop.I can see how something like this would be beneficial for construction-type, workers as an alternative to the plastic coolers some use to carry food, however."
3,NOT Made IN USA,"Bag is not made in USA. I am looking at my bag right now and tag reads made in china. Interior vinyl in upper section is cracked after 3 mo. of use. This is where end panels fold when zippered. Upper and lower sections are insulated so both can be used to keep food cool. Most bottles or cans will have to be stored sideways. Keeps food cold all day with one older Coleman 40 oz ice pack. Overall average bag, killer looks, big enough for full meal and days worth of liquids. Just take 'U.S.A.' out of product description. I know it doesn't say 'Made In' but why else would it be there?"
4,lunch bag,"Perfect for the job with only one small problem - the small zippered mesh pouch on the outside of the bag ripped at the top stitches in two weeks. Otherwise, it is roomy, easy to carry and should last for years."
5,Top notch,"This item is true to its advertising. I am on a personal austerity campaign so instead of buying food on concert or shopping trips, I can take chicken salad and fruit,for example,knowing they will be just as they came from the refrigerator, and can have a picnic all by myself. I also take my own coffee (that's another product) instead of enriching Starbucks. I figure I save about $10.00 per trip, and multiplied by about 20 trips per year, that is a savings of $200.00 per year with healthful food in the bargain."
5,Big bag,"This is a really large lunch bag, think the size of an old doctors case. Looks to be well made arrived in one day."
2,Not impressed.,"While I do like its design, the quality is another issue. After only owning it for a week, the stitching ripped after I tried zipping it closed with food inside. The two compartments are cleverly thought of, but again, I would not buy this again because I was not impressed with the durability."
2,Not the Greatest,"This lunch box is bigger and much clumsier then I expected. The zipped mesh pocket in front is much too small to hold anything with any real bulk (like a cell phone)and is hard to get in to. While the 2 separate food compartments seemed like a nice idea when I bought this, in reality it doesn't really well for me.Would have rather have larger mesh pockets on the outside to hold a drink bottle (or 2) and only one good size compartment for the food."
3,"Great, but not that great","top is big enough for a smoothie, a water bottle, and a small coffee thermos. Bottom is big enough for a salad, sandwich, and a snack. Plus there is a zip pocket.Bad part though is - the bag comes flat (folded over), and it will never stand up straight unless stuffed with food (I'm not talking a slight lean, it is messed up). The liner will rip, but that is expected with any liner of this type. Mine lasted about two years of gentle use. Exterior and zippers still look new (complete with the just out of package lean to), but interior is ripped to shreds."
3,Good Lunchbox,"Great lunchbox, although it needs a zip in compartment between the 2 main storage areas for a cooling pack to keep your items fresh and cool. I put in my blue ice pack on top of the items in the bottom compartment, but its rather inconvenient and clunky when done so."
1,Too little for too much!,The costume is not nearly as nice as it is pictured. It was only a shirt with attached belts and the sizing was way off. I couldn't get the size 7 over my 6 year olds chest. Too many extra assessments needed to make a good costume. Not worth the money.
4,Pre-McGee,"John D. MacDonald has always had the incredible knack for putting character development before plot. A FLASH OF GREEN is the precursor to the Travis McGee books, but MacDonald's gift for characters was already shining. Newspaperman Jimmy Wing, on the trail of a story which may ruin a small Florida ecosystem for development (what else is new?) decides to stick around for the ride, to see who's doing what. Chief among the perpetrators is Elmo Bliss--what a great name! And what a great character! I had just as much fun watching him than I did the narrator. Strangely, I felt I knew more about what made him tick, as opposed to Jimmy. (Then again Jimmy is terribly stand-offish). As the plot unwound, I felt that the pacing did, too. But what held this together, as I said, is the characters, and that's a big plus in my book!"
3,Unable to kill EFX with a Latching footswitch!,"The Alesis MicroVerb 4 does NOT allow the killing of the EFX via a ""latching foot switch.""This is a major flaw for us since we use a latching/toggle switch to kill the EFX during a live performance.Our previous Alesis MidiVerb II model DID allow us to access the EFX with a ""latching foot switch.""I hope this insight was helpful to someone who also uses a ""latching"" switch for their live performance controls on stage.This Alesis MicroVerb 4 model foot switch EFX kill option is completely useless to us, since it will NOT work with a toggle switch."
4,"decent gear, poor follow thru","well, at first glance of using it...the company sent me the wrong power suppley and wrong manual. so the gear wounldnt turn on. but i replaced the power supply and now it works. , i like it"
2,Sachrine,"Jerry Goldsmith's music fits perfectly with the theme of the movie. Unfortunately, this is not always a good thing to have happen. This is one of those times."
2,Worked well while it lasted,"I had this for about 1.5 yrs. And probably used it 2-3 times per month. The gears that drive the rollers have stripped, so the machine no longer functions. I was very disappointed to see it go as it had worked well. But also disappointed that it did not last longer."
1,Fell apart and my baby choked on the pieces,"This toy is sold as a teething toy. My baby has only 2 teeth. While teething on this toy, she chewed off big chunks of rubber off of the ball part of it. She started choking and gagging. Luckily I was there to clear her mouth promptly. I inspect her toys daily when we clean up, and she did this in minutes. I will not be buying anything from Sassy brand again."
3,a good read.,"Well and entertainingly written. It kept my attention throughout. I do have a criticism of the ending. It was like the author noticed the deadline was approaching, and wound it all up with uttermost dispatch. Or maybe the publisher thought it too long, chopped off the last five chapters and replaced it with a few paragraphs to conclude the story. Some of the plot was a bit thin too - is it really likely that three homes out of three would include a murderous individual? Luckily, murderous individuals are not that common.So yes, a good read, but not a work of art."
5,Bloody excellent!,"It was about time they started releasing The Fall's Peel Sessions. The excellent sound quality alone makes it worth it to get them! Anyway, many The Fall fans prefer the really old stuff over the pop-music-oriented stuff they did when *cough cough* Brix was a member of the group. You get a lot of old stuff for your money here.However, Amazon's track listing is wrong. The one they give is what was whispered to be the track listing. However, the tracks from 1983 never made it onto the set. Instead, apart from the two sessions from 1981, the second CD now features two sessions from 1995 and 1996. The tracks are: He Pep!, Oleano, Chilinist, The City Never Sleeps, D.I.Y. Meat, Spinetrack, Spencer, and Beatles Bones 'N' Smokin' Stones."
3,Not well thought out,"The hose inlet is on the top of this item, other floats we own all have the inlet at the back.The position of the hose inlet makes it susceptible for your horses or livestock to nibble the hose."
4,The float follows the water,"I had several of these in remote gravity fed water tanks. Compared to the plastic versions these are the Cadillac. The metal casing resists bovine and elk abuse. Even though I am down to just one remote tank these are the only ones I will use. When the level goes down it lets the water in. When back on the water line the water stops. If you are in an area where it freezes you will need to make sure the float does not freeze into the ice. Either a tank agitator, bubble or stir, or a tank heater will be needed near the float."
4,Good for small hands,"When the Microsoft mouse on my old computer decided to occasionally register just vertical movement, I wanted a replacement that was cheap and convenient. Amazon's online shopping took care of the convenience, and their low price didn't cut into my budget for a whole new computer system.Micro Innovations specializes in low-cost peripherals. You get what you pay for, of course. As with my MI speakers (plenty loud enough, but no bass to speak of), this mouse has limitations. The plastic body isn't as smoothly sculpted as the Microsoft model it replaced. And it's symmetric instead of shaped for right-hand use. As others have pointed out, it's smaller than average; if you've got small hands, this could be a plus for you.The good news: it's been working fine since I bought it. Doing the job, and at a budget price, rates this item 4 stars."
1,You get what you pay for,"This mouse is very lightweight, but the cost is very low. I was in need of something right away, so this fit the bill until I could get a manufacturer replacement for my dead mouse."
1,Pointless and silly,"This is the silliest album I've ever heard. I was a fan of Yngwie's up until about the time of the Fire & Ice album. At that point, I discovered Yngwie is never going to progress past playing speed solos with no thought to the choice of notes. He pretty much butchers the intent of these songs.If you want *musical* chops, listen to Allan Holdsworth or Eric Johnson. I guarantee that if Yngwie is still making CDs in 10 years, it will be the same pointless speed solos...with the same 3 or 4 ""licks""."
2,Not Yngwie Sound,"If I was rating the guitar solos alone, I probably gave it a 4. However, as a whole album, this deserves a 2. Since this is compilation of Ygnwie's tribute to various musicians, don't expect the neoclassical style. If you are into the neoclassical style super fast arpeggio and melodies, this is not the album. While there are just a few songs that are really good, for the most part, unless you are into the type of music Yngwie covers, skip this album."
2,WRONG IDEA,Malmsteen's concept of a tribute album is to take the songs and fill them with endless solos. Just that. The result = zero.
3,Pretty Good Album.,"This CD of Yngwie's versions of different songs that have inspired him is not bad. Of the ten songs on this album, I only like three of them though. Those three would be ""Carry On Wayward Son,"" ""In the Dead of Night,"" and to a smaller degree, ""Anthem."" The others aren't my taste really. ""Child in Time"" is very drawn out and long. It's interesting getting to hear Yngwie sing lead vocals on the Jimi Hendrix tune ""Manic Depression."" I actually like his version of ""Carry On Wayward Son"" better than the Kansas version. Yngwie did a great job with his version; he put more aggression in it. ""In the Dead of Night"" is also one of my favorites on here--very well done indeed. His guitar playing along with the keyboards makes for a very good song, along with Mark Boals good leading vocals. Don't remember if I've heard UK's original version of this song. The cover of the Rush song is also good. The rest of the songs aren't very interesting. This album does have some good moments."
3,"GOOD, NOT GREAT",I agree with firebird phil's comments for the most part. As good as Yngwie is I sometimes find his playing a bit too over the top for me. Nothing here will make me forget the originals but there's nothing wrong with Yngwie covering some of his favorite tracks. It's just that sometimes his playing sounds like just a blur of notes with not much feeling behind them.Less speed and more emotion works for me. For all his amazing talent I'll take Victims of The Future era Gary Moore over Yngwie any day of the week.Even Dave Meniketti works better for me. Personal preference I guess.
4,Interesting,"I just saw Incredible Creatures that Defy Evolution, and enjoyed Dr. Martin's speech, he seemed very knowledgeable and eloquent. It is clear to me that Christ's followers will be mocked, criticized and labeled as ignorants for their beliefs. The teaching of the Bible, is to believe God's Word, even before leaning on one's understanding, if it says 6 days, and one believes it, then that's what it means to be a Believer. This things are simple, but they are hidden from those who do not believe God's Word, and instead replace it with theories based on their understanding. I haven't seen these videos, but I applaud those who stand in the teaching of the Truth, I may not understand the whole Bible, but that's no reason for me to make up my own theories, and rank them as more feasible than a Bible verse, wouldn't that defeat the whole Believer thing?"
3,Too small,"I like the plate, but it was too small, I thouhgt it was larger, but is still nice, to serve."
3,Could use some improvements,"I don't think this pasta cooker is that different from others of its kind, but it does have two drawbacks.First, the basket (where you put the pasta) sits a few inches above the bottom of the pot, so there is very little room for the pasta itself. You pretty much need to put in at least a gallon of water to cook any pasta, and that adds about 15-20 minutes to the time it takes for the water to boil (compared to a small pot that you would normally use to cook that much pasta).Second, the holes on the bottom of the basket are too large for angel hair pasta, so it's not possible to empty the basket without picking out individual strands, and small lengths of pasta just fall right through completely."
1,Watch not as pictured.,The watch I received was not the same watch shown when I purchased it. The watch I received did not have the Seiko name nor the numbers on the face as shown. The watch I received did not have a blue background either. The band and watch face border were the only things that were the same as the watch shown.I returned it and was promptly given a full refund.
2,Burning when used with gas,"The three previous reviews, while not in agreement, point out one serious flaw in this cookware for some gas users.We have had a set for nearly 15 years and it worked fine when used with electric stoves. We now have a professional gas cooktop with very large burners. As a result, we get burning along the sides of the pots.The base of each unit has a thick copper core that promotes even heating. The heat from the gas flame causes burning to occur along the sides where the metal is thin.We are planning to convert most of our cookware to thicker units (All-Clad or Calphalon style) as we replace them."
2,Looks better than it performs,"This smart-looking, relatively easy-to-clean cookware has several drawbacks. The hollow handles look like they would stay cool, but in fact they get blazingly hot. If you want to use it for everyday, any kids in the kitchen must be warned. It is fairly lightweight and so food tends to burn, even if the heat is low. Not what you would expect, for the money. The stockpot is fine for boiling water in which to cook pasta (for example) but for simmering, a heavier pot would be more suitable. Not a particularly good value."
4,perhaps the book could be longer?,"Bose gives a good elucidation of the basic ideas in operations research. While the book is somewhat slender, it contains enough details so that a reader new to the field can understand the mathematical framework and implement the methods.I wonder, though, if the book might be usefully expanded to give a more comprehensive description? The ideas are touched on, but it is almost as if by further elaboration, the reader would see much broader scope of the methods, and be in a stronger position to use them."
2,Not Sophie's best movie,"I'm a big Sophie Marceau fan and wanted to give this movie a try. While I'm still a huge fan of hers, I have to believe this is not her best work. The story is weak, the special effects are bad and for the most part the acting isn't very good either.It's nice that several scenes were shot inside the Louve and some nice shots of Paris. Of course Sophie Marceau is always easy on the eyes too. But if it wasn't for those 3 things the rest of the movie is nearly unwatchable.Sophie Marceau has done some excellent work and I look forward to watching some more of her movies. Every actor/actress makes a few duds in their career and for her this is probably it."
1,HORRID!!!,"This movie was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. When I ordered it I didn't realize it was in French with English subtitles. That didn't bother me and was about the only thing that kept me interested for the first hourish. I quit watching it because there was NOTHING good about it. It was poorly acted, there were NO SPECIAL EFFECTS, I honestly would not recommend this to anyone regardless of what type of movie you like...I love French so I enjoyed listening to the words...that is about it!"
1,Too old to be useful,I was very disappointed to see the 2001 copyright. I don't think I have to tell anyone how much has changed between 2001 and 2009. Not to mention the content is from before even 2001. Get something more current.
5,"Beautiful Home, Beautiful Book","My family visited Hearst Castle in September 2009 and the bookstore there wanted a lot of money for this book. I knew to wait until I got home to order it from Amazon, and I'm glad I did! I saved money like I always do with Amazon prices. The book has so many beautiful photos of the home, inside and out; it definately reminds me of the tour we took, and the remaining tours we need to take. A great buy for those who visited the home."
3,Should have been better,This is one of the most photogenic estates and locations still standing. Therefore nothing less than the best photos will do. In a place like San Simeon one would expect the best artistry from the photographers. But here we get the ordinary. The photos are not near dramatic enough and the printing of the photos gives them a washed out and faded look. In addition the production quality of the book is not that great. I would expect a heavy coffee table style book with heavy paper and thick boards. This book has the appearence of a cost cutting effort. To see how to do this right look at 'Carolands' and 'Waddesdon Manor' and 'Newport Villas' and the recent Acanthus Press series on great estates. These are sumptuous volumes where great care has gone into the production. San Simeon deserves equal.
4,Hearst better understood now,"I enjoyed this book, and the details of his life relating to the building of this wonderful American treasure. I wish there had been more photos showing the details of the fine art and antiques collected from Europe early in this past century. Also it would have been worthwhile to show much more and better photos of the architectural elements of stone moulding, stucco detail, doors, tiles, ceilings, floor designs and iron work."
3,Bonaparte's Retreat NOT the ORIGINAL,"I sent away for this album extremely excited about owning ""Bonaparte's Retreat."" I found......just like on the ""MONUMENT STORY"" that they have used an alternate take. It's like drawing a mustache on the Mona Lisa. I want the original version please. The same take as the hit 45. Interesting that his other hits on this album are the originals."
4,Billy Grammer At His Best.,"Billy Grammer is a legend in every since of the word, he is not only a good singer but a guitar master, when you think of Chet Atkins, Les Paul, Doc Watson, & Merle Travis Billy Grammer's name is right in that list. This CD features his vocal abilities, i just wish they could of included some of his great insturmental work. I have an old Gospel LP that he put out in 1962, its all insturmentals but when your a guitar wizard why not let the guitar do the singing for you? :) Billy Grammer joined the grand ole opry in 1959, his recording of Gotta Travel On is credited as being the song that brought him to the opry where he continues to perform to this day, i heard him singing a new song on there in August of 2004, he also happend to mention that night that he and his wife were celebrating there 60th Wedding Anniversary, Congratulations Billy!"
4,4 STARS,"I FOUND THIS ALBUM A VERY GOOD MUSICAL EXPERIANCE. THE GUITAR WORK WAS EXCELLANT. THE VOCAL CLARITY WAS SHARP AND FREE OF NASAL TWANG. I WISH THAT ALL MUSIC WAS AS CLEAR TO UNDERSTAND AS THIS. THE MUSIC IS OF A TIME PAST , BUT IS STILL CURRENT IN MOST OF THE TITLES."
5,LOVE IT!!!,I love my new movado watch. The color was exactly what I wanted and it matches everything in my closet. It came in perfect condition. Everything is brand new and the product came alot quicker than I've expected. It was the best mother's day present.
4,It's a wacky pop party!!!!!,"This album is simple, lo-fi, FUN! It's pop often augmented with tuba, and the boys' sense of humor is evident on every track. I think my favorite track is ""Swerve On,"" though it's not really even a song, but more of a kinky jam session. The sound is very unpolished, so it gets grating at times, but overall the vibe is just laid-back, slackin' good times."
5,Weather Glass,"I remember haveing a weather glass in our home when I was a child. It's amazing how accurate it really is at forecasting weather. I am very happy with this product, and I hope to enjoy it for many years to come."
3,"fan of Pimsleur, but disappointed by this","I've been very happy with Pimsleur products for learning French, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, and Portuguese. This was the first time I've listened to the ""Plus"" level and and also the first time that I felt that listening to my Pimsleur lessons was a waste of time. The very little new vocabulary offered in these ten lessons is mostly specific to the publishing industry, and I found this set noticeably more repetitive than the comprehensive sets.I would skip this set and move on to a grammar book or a vocabulary product (I like Vocabulearn, which after Pimsleur will kick you in den Ars**)"
2,Not up to the normally excellent Pimsleur standard,"This is supposed to be an extension of the comprehensive Pimsleur German courses. German ""Plus"" is an afterthought and a waste of time. German 1-3 are excellent, but do yourself a favor and take the cash you'd have spent on this and get Schaum's Outlines German Grammar instead, along with a set of the Vis-ed German vocabulary cards."
3,Not worth $70.,"The first 90 German courses are good. The last 10 have a low signal-to-noise ratio. They focus on highly specific vocabulary about dealing with literary agents and talking about books.The typical conversation is:""Haben sie den Roman Ins Chaos gelesen?""""Ja, ich habe ihn neulich gelesen. Er war spannend.""""Ich glaube er braucht einen neuen englischen Titel.""""Morgen treffe ich mich mit der Agentin. Der Roman ist auf der Bestsellerliste.""So, much vocabulary of the publishing world. There are only a few words in the 5-hour long series that are globally useful. ""spannend,"" ""neulich,"" and a few grammatical constructions like ""Wovon handelt etw.?"" (What is sthg. about?) are what you will learn."
1,Made of cheap materials,"I /think/ this is the food processor I have. It's worked fine motor-wise so far (but it's only been 2 years), but the problem is that some small, incredibly fragile piece of plastic broke off the tall lid, the one used for slicing, before I even used it - so now it won't fit, which means it won't close securely enough which it means it won't operate."
1,Really not what it used to be,"I have used the same two Cuisinarts for 30 years, but the cup and cover finally cracked on first one and then the other. I bought this as a replacement (when I could have just purchased new bowl & locking cover for the old ones) thinking it was time for a change. BIG mistake.-The so-called wide feed tube must have a narrower feed tube inserted for the machine to actually turn on -- and it is very tricky to get the feed tube in place and out. So not really a wide feed in practice, when you need it.-It takes real strength: much too much, kind of like wrestling -- to get the lid off after use.-It took a few tries to understand how to turn it on at all: there is a small white plastic lock mechanism in the narrow, inner feed tube that must be pushed to the left to lock and right to open.The whole thing is very unappealing to use, in short. What used to be quick and easy is a hassle. Buy replacement bowls for your old model."
5,Great product. Wish I had ordered it months sooner.,"It's everything I expected. Does a great job chopping, blending, mixing, grating etc. It has simplified many of my tedious preparation chores. I get carried away with it sometimes.Was worth every penny!"
5,Works great.,Does what food processor should. Glad I bought it. Highly recommend others buy it too. Here are the other words I was forced to include.
3,Flawed design,"I had this food processor for more than 6 years. It worked quite well. We used it to grate a lot of cheese, slice veggies, make salsa, make latkes... However, the plastic the bowl and lid are made from is not strong enough to stand the test of time. I had to replace the bowl and parts of the lid several times because they would crack. As the price of the replacement parts began to approach the price of a new food processor, I've decided we need a new one. We'll probably go for the KitchenAid, because even though the Cuisinart now has a new design for their 11 cup food processor, I just don't trust it."
3,Cuisinart Food Processor,I have had a cuisine art food processor for many years. My last one was destroyed in a fire. I replaced it with this one. I works great after you figure out how to assemble it. I can't remember from one time to the next how it all goes together and it has to be perfect or it doesn't work. It needs to be easier to put together or better marked which direction it goes. Other than that it's great.
1,BPA,"I find it very sad that BPA is a known toxin and yet there is no regulation regarding it's use in food preparation material. Upon some research, I found that the prep bowl is made of a plastic that contains BPA and so, I returned this product.Cusinart has a commercial company, Waring, that makes a stainless steel bowl, but you have to purchase that food processor, which is close to $600 plus $100 for the bowl. Which I gladly did for the health and well-being of my family."
2,No Bread Mixer!,"My main reason for purchasing this item was bread making, i.e. heavy breads. I reasoned that this machine would save me a great deal of time. It simply does not have the power needed for heavy dough mixing, so I have placed an order for the Kitchen Aid stand mixer. I hate having so many small appliances around my small kitchen. Sure wish someone would design a food processor with a transmission and variable speeds. I usually work my breads on a butcher block using a small childs bat. It takes extreme kneading if you intend to really bring up the gluten in home ground wheat flour. Not being into sauces and fancy things, don't know what I will do with this machine."
2,There are better choices.,"This food processor is made in China. For the same amount of money you can buy an 11 cup Kitchen Aid. It runs smoother, has the slicing blades and a mini bowl. The blades are Sabatier and are excellent. We tried both machines and returned the Cuisinart."
3,Compare to the KitchenAid before you buy,"We headed out not long ago to buy a food processor and I would have *sworn* that the Cuisinart would be my choice - it's practically synonymous with ""food processor""! A quick look at the new KitchenAid model changed my mind, though.We were told that Cuisinart isn't being made the way it used to be - lesser quality blades, for example. The old blade-maker now provides KitchenAid with their blade, incidentally. Comparing the two models side by side, it's quickly apparent that the Cuisinart isn't nearly as well-made and it's much harder to clean than the Kitchenaid which is basically a single, sealed, ""wipe clean"" surface.I hated to turn my back on a legendary product, but we've never looked back. Compare before you buy, especially at the identical price."
3,"Good performance, but feed tube is a pain in the butt","I've had my Cuisinart for about 2 or 3 years now, and it does its job really well, as far as chopping and slicing and kneading goes. My complaint with it is that a very narrow and flismy plastic piece on the feed tube mechanism is NECESSARY for it work (I assume as a safety feature). Well, about a year into it, mine broke off (did I mention it's flimsy). I have ""made do"" with kinda wedging it in place each time I want to use the machine, but then I have to stand there and hold it the whole time it's running. I'm thinking if I ever lose this critical piece, that I will probably buy a Kitchen Aid."
3,Same problem with Cuisinart,"I have had the same problem as the two other people who wrote less than satisfactory reviews with Cuisinart processors. I have had a 7-cup for years, and the ""flimsy"" plastic sleeve that fits into the back to allow the unit to turn on keeps breaking. Each time I have to order a replacement top from a kitchen products replacement parts store. It's about $35 each time. Am getting tired of doing that and am doing research into buying a new machine. After reading these reviews, will probably go with Kitchenaid. Thanks for the reviews."
2,"Poor parts, no replacement parts offered","Both the detachable stem and bottom stem over the motor shaft suddenly shattered. When I called to get a replacement part, I was told that the bottom stem piece was not available, rendering the entire machine a useless brick. The locking mechanism for the bowl on the new model is both archward makes even simple tasks difficult. I had an original unit (when they were made by robot coupe) and it worked flawlessly for over 20 years. On this model you can't even get the parts to repair it. Definately going with another manufacturer for my replacement unit."
1,Can't get it to work,"This is an impossible product! Save your time and your blood pressure and forget it. I can't even tell if the thing is broken or if it's so hard to get the lid to assemble correctly that it won't work -- and that seems to be a frequent complaint on this line all over the Internet.Stupidly, I bought this three months ago, but didn't try to use it until today so I can't return it on top of the dinner I wanted to make being ruined because I couldn't get the right piece of equipment to work.So save your money and get a different brand! Or at least, if you do buy test it out swiftly and BEFORE YOU NEED IT! Or else you'll have a ruined dinner party and be out $100+, too."
3,Works well but poorly edsigned,The Pro Custom 11 cup food processor from Cuisinart works well enough but is poorly designed. It is very difficult to clean the pusher assembly unit. Food gets stuck between the walls of the inner assembly and becausse it will not separate it is almost impossible to get clean. This is a very poor design and I cannot believe that a company would ever take this to production! The pusher assembly should just be one piece and not two.Also the handle is a narrow clear plastic tube which is open on both ends. Again food gets stuck inside the handle and is very difficult to remove. I'm happy with the power and sharpness of the blades. The grade of plastic however feels very cheap. I hope it will last. There are a lot of little plastic parts hanging loose that can easily break off.
4,You get what you pay for.,"Compared to other Food Processors, This Cuisinart DLC-8S is a little on the high end of the price range. Although, it is very powerful and quiet. It can also handle a large amount of food at one time. I love it and think it is worth it to spend a little more up front and be happy while you are using it. Good quality goes a long way in my book. <END>WAZZZ"
5,Love this item,"I use this for making Hummus, Pie Crusts, Chopping onions for Masala, and various other duties. Would not trust any other brand, and prefer the lever-style buttons to the press buttons."
2,They don't make 'em like they used to,"This is my third Cuisinart food processor which I purchased to replace my 7 cup model (the base motor died). I definitely see poorer quality in terms of the plastic bowls, feeding tube, etc. It is difficult to slide the bowl into locked position and also difficult to get it to release when you are done. The feeding tube top is very cheaply made and I am surprised that it has not snapped yet. It is also difficult to get the lids to slide into a locked position which, of course, is necessary in order to get the machine to turn on. It is a challenge every time I use it which is less frequently now compared to my previous 7 cup model.All and all I will not be purchasing another Cuisinart once my machine dies."
2,Designed Looking Thru a Mirror,"What is it with food processors that no one can design a unit without a serious flaw? The feed slot and interlock mechanism are on the rear of the unit and the bowl handle and controls are on the front. Like the engineer could not decide if he was coming or going. Maybe they bench tested it with two operators? Also, you better place your unit within 12"" of the outlet as the cord is ridiculously short. The cusinart bowl still has the same, easily broken, interlocks that my old unit had."
4,Great for dressings and pie crust...,"I tend to use a blender for pureeing soup and knives for chopping and dicing. However, this is the perfect tool for making dressings or shredding cabbage. It also works REALLY well for cutting cold butter into flour for pastries and pie crust."
2,"flimsy, brittle work bowls","I've used Cuisinart processors for probably 30 years, but unfortunately the quality has gone to hell. I purchased one about 2 years ago, and even though I have used this one infrequently, usually just for grating cabbage for slaw or for making mayonnaise and aioli and only occasionally for slicing potatoes, the bowl is already cracked. The company that now makes Cuisinart is the old Ronco manufacturer. Apparently to bolster their corporate bottom line they have taken steps to cheapen the product and diminish its quality. And to add insult to injury, replacing the bowl, lid, chute and pusher--just the Lexan pieces--will cost you about $100, not significantly less than the cost of a whole new food processor. It's a shame, really, because I've read that the processors made by Kitchen Aide slosh liquids like oil and purees out of the bowl. So the bottom line seems to be that in the USA there are no high-quality, well-designed food processors being made. Kind of sucks, really."
2,Safety interlock is problematic,"I just donated my Cuisinart food processor to a charity after many years of fighting the safety interlock on it. I just couldn't easily get the bowl mounted on the base, the lid on and the system up and running. I had the same problem taking the bowl off of the base after I was done ""processing"". Last week I'd finally had it (I found myself using a small mallet to get the bowl on and off of the base and positioned over the safety lock), and ordered myself a 7 cup unit from Kitchenaid. So much easier to use; I'm sorry that I waited so long. I don't miss my Cuisinart at all."
5,i bought a cuisinart,"um, i bought a cusinart, it was exactly what i expected and it came quickly and it works. seller was just fine."
1,Removal of bowl from base,Removal of the bowl from the base is impossible with breaking the white pplastic locking pin. The manual says nothing about doing it.
1,BPA,Before I can rate on performance I would like to know if the plastic bowl for this unit contains BPA. I need a food processor for pureeing soups (hot liquids) and that would mean that BPA in the plastic bowl would definitely leach into my foods.
2,Hopefully Kitchenaid is Better,"I have owned my Cuisinart 11 Cup Processor for many years. It broke last night--the plastic piece that locks in. It has never been easy to use and always a fight to lock the top in place. The sleeve cracked many years ago but never broke. I tried to find replacement parts on-line, but they no longer support the model I have. The recommended parts are extremely expensive. Based on the raving reviews of the remanufactured Kitchenaid Food Processor and the reasonable price, I ordered one today. It was cheaper than purchasing the Cuisinart replacement parts. I can't live without a food processor--no cook should."
3,Not the greatest,"Hi there, I have had my Cuisinart for under a year. For some reason it is not pulsing although everything is 'locked' on and its turned on, plugged in, etc. I'm frustrated because customer service has not responed at all. By chance has anyone else experienced this? Could you post your solution (if you fixed it?) Thanks!"
4,time saver,"I received this food processor as a wedding gift and it's been such a timesaver. It's great for prepping for a dinner party because it can handle large quantities. The regular blade works really well on all vegetables--the only one I've had a problem with is onions, which either don't get minced enough or get too liquidy when I try to make the pieces smaller. Other than that, the shredding attachment is great for zucchini and carrots and the slicing attachment works well for slicing potatoes or squash. The mixing attachment even does a pretty good job with dough. Of all the small kitchen appliances I received as wedding gifts, this is by far the one I use the most."
5,MUST HAVE! GREAT FUNNY STORY....,"This is a Must have. They story is a Latin twist to ""The Three Little Bears"". A grandfather telling the story to his grandson. They illistrations are great too. Instead of porridge the Little Bears eat Frijoles (Beans). You read the book in English on one side and flip the book and read it in Spanish. Its a great story and the Spanish is everyday Spanish. At this price buy one for every little one you know."
5,Awesome book!,"Great book! Even had translation, although, in the back or upside down or something (Kind of annoying to flip through, but , read it, study it, remember it, for the child.) super fun times!"
4,Great Character Movie,"I wasn't certain how I would feel about this movie or even if I COULD feel anything about it other than hatred. It's about a child molester; how could that be a good thing?But, I have to say that it was absolutely terrific.I think most pedophiles are NOT sorry. They don't care about or empathize with their victims at all. Many are actual or borderline sociopaths. But, Kevin Bacon portrays the minority. A pedophile who actually wants to change.During one scene where he is talking to a little girl in the woods, I actually found myself holding my breath and then breathing out ""Don't do it. Don't do it.""Yes, this movie had me talking out loud to the main character.I guess my only real fault with the film was Bacon's new 'girlfriend'. As much as I felt for the character, there is no way in real life that I would knowingly consort with a pedophile.Overall:An excellent film with an astounding performance by Bacon."
3,a pretty good movie.,"kevin bacon does a good job as playing the role of a convicted sex offender. not an easy task.You knew he was a child molester but it didn't show exactly what he did.he paid his debt to society but his past still haunts him. he meets a nice woman who finally accepts him for what he is. everyone else basically hates him.luckily he gets a job and finds a apartment but you can tell he has urges. the film takes a different twist, it really concentrates more on a pedophile suffering with his urges than a victim which made it unique.i do recommend this film. the actors are good. a pretty good movie. although there are some disturbing parts of the movie. other than that. it's a good enough movie to see."
2,Disturbing,"The Woodsman is a highly enveloping, yet highly disturbing film. This is a tribute, I suppose, to the superb acting of Kevin Bacon as one sick and immensely troubled child molester. Kyra Sedgwick, Mos Def, and Eve all perform extraordinarily well and are all utterly convincing in their roles as well. The directing by Nicole Kassell was dead-on from start to finish. All of that being said, I found the film content and script so incredibly disconcerting that I could scarcely bare to finish the movie.That is, after all, a true testament to the cast at pulling off their roles such a disturbingly convincing manner. The Woodsman, however, is just not a movie that I would ever want to see again."
4,why it's not 5 stars,"if you've read any of the other reviews - you'll know the plot of the movie, so i won't waste your time. i very much enjoyed this film and i feel it should have been rewarded more at awards time. the acting is terrific from kevin bacon and kyra sedgewick to mos def and the actress who plays the little girl.my quibble and i think it's a big one is - how would society, the parole board or whatever the agencies that would be involved are allow a convicted pedophile to live across the street (and i do mean close !!!) to a grade school with small children ??? where i live released pedophiles are watched and monitored like a hawk. i don't care how hard he says it was to find an apartment. the dept. of corrections or whatever agency would never let him live where he lives.am i quibbling ??? he lives in a big city and released convicts do fall through the cracks when we try to keep track of them or monitor them.(...). still; see this movie !!!!!!"
4,"""The Woodsman""--has a good plot","When I begged my mom for her to rent this via NetFlix, I was excited. After reading the POSITIVE reviews, I was pumped. Turns out that it does, indeed, go slow, but it picks up momentum.There is a ""and there you have it"" in this movie--when Det. Lucas was like ""Have you heard of that one fairytale...with the woodsman...how he saved a girl from the big bad wolf?"", it makes you think at the end of the movie that Kevin Bacon's character is, indeed, the woodsman.When you rent this, you'll see why."
2,A movie that doesn't know where it's going,"I didn't like it. I was expecting to experience something profound, but the movie was fairly banal. I like Kevin Bacon a lot, and I'm very interested in the nature of pedophilia and its management (and sympathetic to pedophiles trying earnestly to manage their condition), but the storyline here is just lacking. There is very little emotional movement of any of the characters, so the movie is very flat. I was constantly waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever did. So maybe someone will argue that the movie is ""realistic"" and real life is pretty flat. Well sure, except that the movie is *not* realistic. When a 40 year-old guy is sitting alone on a bench in the park, a cute 11 year-old girl does not ever sit herself down next to him and say ""how's the view"". It doesn't happen. If you're going to have bizarre events in a movie, you have to at least make them do some emotional work. Here, nothing. Never see the girl again. I don't get it."
2,"great acting, but unbearably BORING","I like and respect all of the actors that were in this film, and they did a great job as usual. However, the performances could not cover up the fact that almost nothing happened the entire movie. I was so bored I almost left the theatre, but just forced myself to finish because I already bought my ticket. I don't understand how watching Kevin Bacon pace around his room, and occasionally break down to his therapist and Kyra Sedwick over and over again can make up a two hour movie. That is really all that happened for three quarters of the movie, then an unfulfilling ending. I'm actually quite suprised so many people wrote all these great reviews about it, it was painfully boring and bleak. Don't see it if you're expecting a powerful, thought-provoking film like I did, you will be dissapointed."
3,This movie is sickening in a real sense.,"Kevin Bacon does capture this part very very well. You actually feel like he's struggling with this disease, but as for Oscar nomination for this role, I don't see it. Its not that good of a movie. I'll never watch this movie again. And its not just the plot of the movie, its just not that good of a movie as a whole. And on top of it not being a good movie, its quite nauseating in places. Kind of hard to sit through and watch....."
2,Blah,"I like Kevin Bacon which is why I watched this movie. I thought the movie was a bit boring, slow moving, but while I was watching it I thought there was going to be a point, a profound message at the end. There wasn't. Overall I think this movie was just a big waste of time. Could have gone somewhere, but it didn't."
5,Best of Slim Whitman,"I bought this cd for my husband, a big fan, and he loves it. I get to hear it too, though I'm not as big a fan as he is. It was very reasonable, it was shipped promptly and was well packed."
5,Lots of Fun,My daughters and I had a great time creating this pet calendar as a gift for their father. We can't wait to see his face when he opens it. It is something that can be enjoyed by the entire family throughout the year.
4,Exactly what you'd expect --,"-- but that's hardly a bad thing. The stories themselves range from well-done to poor, from well-known characters like Superman to obscure ones like the Whip and Slam Bradley. The most interesting thing about the compilation is the ""Fair Facts"" and data scattered throughout the first two books -- it makes for a nice glimpse at the way this World's Fair was viewed, and, to an extent, how important it was, or at least seemed to be at the time.Four instead of five stars, because there's enough mediocre work to make it not an unalloyed pure joy to read. But it's certainly worth picking up if you'd like, in essence, a good sampler of Golden Age comic work."
3,Sad,"SO I haven't used it yet but I was pretty angry to realize that I paid double the price. I had no idea where to look for this dryer and of course my always trusting amazon had it but when I went to Target I saw it for 19.99. I am a little upset, probably fair game but nonetheless sad."
5,Hello Kitty is the MEOW,"I have used the same Hello Kitty hair dryer almost every day for 5 years. It is light weight but not when it comes to heat and air. I have thick long hair and it dries quickly and smoothly. I like it so much I have purchased several for gran-daughters, girl friends and once as a bridal shower gift. Everyone has elaborated on how much they like this product and a few have carried on the gift choice to their family and friends. I had purchased them at Target but now, thanks to my Amazon Prime Shipping, I don't have to purchase, then spend money to ship"
5,Fantastic!,"I found this cookware to be fantastic. I was unsure of the stainless steel, favoring non-stick, but the stainless steel works fantastic. I have not have any problems with anything sticking. I have read in other reviews where someone used steel wool (SOS pads) to clean the cookware, however the instructions clearly state not to do so. I thought it was an excellent price. As far as that goes, Amazon has excellent prices on all Cuisinart (my favorite brand.) I am going to build my Cuisinart collection, via Amazon, thanks to their great deals. Thanks Amazon!"
4,"Beautiful, but hard to clean","When I was purchasing this set, I forgot to pay attention to the fact that there is no easy clean lining in any of the pieces. On the other hand, these pans heat wonderfully and are gorgeous.I have one of Cuisinart's frying pans with a ""no-stick"" cooking surface. I would say that it is as close to perfection as you can get for stove top cooking."
2,"Ok, But watch the handles","When I received the set, I was pretty impressed. Unfortunately this honeymoon period did not continue once I used the pans. The handles on all of the pans heat up so that you need to always use mits with when handling them. To me, this is a big problem. I have all clad and other makes and have never had such a problem with hot handles. Otherwise, these pans are nice looking and appear to be well made. But, bottom line, take a pass."
4,Entertaining look at falconry practices 150 years ago.,"Richard Burton describes his experiences living in the Sindh province (modern day Pakistan). He details the various birds of prey used by the falconers, and relates the tales of his hunting expeditions.This is definately not a how-to book, rather it is a glimpse at the history of falconry as it was practiced in the Indus valley."
2,"Couldn't get past his ""Membrum"".","Although this book has it's moments and is a fairly good read, I can't recommend it. It seemed to me that the author is obsessed with Danlo's ""membrum"". I have never read a book that overused one particular word so much or dedicated so many pages to his main characters penis. Or maybe, the author thought it was a clever word he made up and decided to make the most of it. At times I told myself that if he uses that word again more than three times on one page, I would just have to lay it down and walk away. Maybe I just failed to recognize the significance or symbolism of Danlo's ""membrum"", but I really got tired of reading about it. The book also contradicts itself several times which was distracting and took me out of the story yet again. So, if you don't mind reading about ""membrums"", this book may be for you, as I said ealier, it is a decent read. Just be aware of this before you buy it."
5,The Broken God,"A great read.Zidell managers to put you into the book , you feal like one of the many farout characters."
4,The Illustrated Book of Science Fiction Ideas and Dreams,"THIS,LIKE DAVID KYLE'S FIRST BOOK, A PICTORIAL HISTORY OF SCIENCE FICTION, IS BOTH A RARE FEAST FOR THE EYES AS WELL AS A LITERARY WORK THAT COVERS THE VIEWS OF EARLY SCIENCE FICTION WRITERS AND ARTISTS OVER THE DECADES."
5,Great Family Movie,"Great classic movie with humor our whole family and extended family enjoyed!Nice to see in color, had only seen previously in black and white"
4,We're No Angles,"A funny, light hearted, unique look at Christmas. The cast is all top notch. Who would ever think that 3 convicts on Devils Island would be considered Angles.A big improvement in quality over our old and worn out VHS tape."
3,Cute romantic comedy,"I gave We're No Angels 3 stars because of the story line, the believable actors and the feel good mood. The movie held my interest from the beginning when the 3 prisoners escaped and ventured into a diverse ethnic environment."
5,Tongue in cheek,"Great old movie, all three stars are great, Peter Ustinov hilarious. If you enjoy older movies and clever comedy-give it a try"
5,My Favorite Christmas Movie,"Every year, this is my special Christmas movie and each year I introduce more people to it. From children to 80-somethings, they've all enjoyed it tremendously. This next year, I plan to give this as birthday presents."
5,Devils Island & Sentimental Moments!,"An annual veiwing event at our house each Christmas. My first copy was taped off Ch. 38 in Boston back in the 70's,with Dana Hershey commentary and commercials. It has become unwatchable from wear so I was delighted to see it had made it to DVD.In a nutshell, 3 convicts, Bogart, Ustinov and Ray have escaped from prison and plan to leave Devil,s Island, but get caught up with the innocent family who runs the general store. The owner, mean Cousin Ardre (Rathbone), pays a surprise visit on Christmas Eve.Ustinov, Bogart, Ray and ""Adolph"" relate so beautifully with the other characters. Innocence, evil, redemption and love come through this corny but wonderful movie. You'll cry when Joan Bennett sings ""Sentimental Moments"" and laugh yourself silly when, well, whenever those ""four"" are around Paul & Cousin Andre. With the color and clarity so good, it's a hoot to look at all the details of the shop and home that I hadn't seen before."
4,A funny family Christmas film and a subtle black comedy!,"And starring Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov, Joan Bennett, and Basil Rathbone. I thought this movie would be a silly family film. Wrong. This is a black, but subtle, black comedy. Without giving to much away, I'll just say you don't see any bodies, blood, or the ""weapon"". I highly suggest buying or renting this movie. It was one of the nominations for the AFI's 100 Funniest."
5,He followed me against my will!!!,This is a true delight...with a rare but extraordinary comedic performance by Humphrey Bogart. An excellent movie by any standards. I sincerely hope this movie is released on DVD!!!
5,we're no angles,"This is one of those movies that from the opening to the end, you smile, and feel this long forgotton warmth that reminds us there is good in EVERYBODY. I watched this movie when i was a little girl, and couldent belive Amazon carried it! Was i thrilled to get it. Buy it, watch it, love it, and find yourself watching it agian!!"
4,A holiday favorite at our house,"This classic features an outstanding cast and script that looks and feels more like a stage production than a movie. Audiences brought up on flash-bang special effects and sweeping visuals will likely become frustrated waiting for the action to kick-in. The context and setting may be lost on younger viewers as well. But if you're looking for a holiday feel good movie, ""We're No Angels"" deserves consideration."
2,We're no angles dvd,"I was very happy with the service that I experienced. However, when ordering, I missed the information that it was in a non-USA format. it would be lovely to return this if given a chance and get one that is usa format as this is a great movie."
2,Better the first time,"I saw this film in the early 60's when I was 15 or 16, along with 4 friends. It was I remember the funniest film I had ever seen. My friends and myself laughed the whole way through and the rest of the audience laughed along with us. I decided in Jan this year to see if it was available on video or DVD and surprise, surprise, I was able to buy it on Amazon. If you haven't seen it, you don't know what you are missing. Great performances from Bogey, Aldo Ray and Peter Ustinov."
1,"Yuk (yuk,yuk)","It's hard to believe such a ""classic"" had evaded me for all these years, until last night. Would it have evaded me forever. What is this, a Christmas special written for the Three Stooges by a very drunk Noel Coward? Bogie, phoning in his lines, does not make for good cinema. The totally cheesy set? Don't get me started. And as to the cavalier murder of the two antagonists, this is for the kiddies? Don't like the baddies, sic a poisonous snake on 'em? Bah humbug, at least Dickens had the complex idea of reforming Scrooge. Glib stupidity."
5,WE'RE NO ANGELS,WHAT A CHRISTMAS CLASSIC .VERY DIFFERENT PART FOR BOGART.I DECIDED TO BUY IT BECAUSRE I GOT TRIED OF WAITING FOR IT TO COME ON TV AT 4 A.M.WELL WORTH WATCHING.
5,Excellent,Excellent movie. VERY well done. Actors were superb and you could HEAR and UNDERSTAND everything they said! I highly recommend this movie. The only comedy that Bogart did and it was great!!!
3,"Cheap, Very Portable, But...","I keep these in my computer bag for those days (1-2/week) that I am not in my primary office, where I have a decent pair of phones. First and foremost, they are extremely portable. The case is probably 3-4 inches in diameter, so they'll take up little space. The sound is decent. After 6-8 hours wearing them, though, and inserting/removing numerous times when moving about, the comfort level drops precipitously. Also, the cord is pretty short, so even pushing away from the desk can put you at the end of your tether. Still, for [X] or less, they are not much of an investment. I am searching reviews now for some 'phones that are going to be more comfortable. I can't imagine I'll find anything more portable.So, for infrequent use, these are fine. For more regular or prolonged use while on the road, I'm going to spend more and hopefully get something more comfortable."
1,Remarkably bad genealogy,"In my title I almost said ""remarkably bad genealogical scholarship,"" but anyone familiar with the previous editions of this book will recognise that it would be inaccurate to associate the word ""scholarship"" with this book.All of the serious flaws present in the earlier editions remain in this book: rampant spelling and transcription errors, erroneous and misleading bibliographical entries, and the presentation of purely conjectural genealogical theories as though they were a part of ""the complete known ancestry of John of Gaunt.""These kinds of embarassing errors are found repeatedly on every single page of this book.Due to the great amount of inaccuracy and genealogical nonsense, anyone seriously interested in royal medieval genealogy would do well to steer clear of this book."
1,Full of mistakes and a lot of lines not reliable,"This book must be avoided! It is full of mistakes, some big mistakes that could let you dream about some ancestors who are not in fact.Biggest errors are for example Makhir/Theuderic and Zaida cases.The bibliography is bad, it looks like he added works he never saw!Don't waste your money with this book! This is bad genealogy and you cannot be sure of anything from this book."
3,Wow Amazon,"Congrats on getting away with photoshopping a picture of James Cameron onto a montage of Avatar pics. (Caveat, I have not seen this piece from 60 minutes, so if the collage is from CBS, i digress) but having an adaquate eye for photoshops, i gotta call shenangians on the glasses, not calling BS on part of Amazon, because offering streamable content from the web for $17 on DVD-Rs is a great business move, I'm just saying the Amazon product design can't fool us all with those glasses. Next time, look at the shadows from the wrinkles in his face and shirt. thanks :D (Awesome movie and I still love ya Amazon, no hard feelings?"
3,Bad bosses,"The book highlights well, the bad behavior of some bosses.Is a good book for anyone suffering through the negative impact a bad boss can have on your well being at work."
5,Great Disposer,"Great product for the price. Arrived very fast. Installed in 40 min. Please note, it does not come with the power cord."
1,insinkerator evergrind GD,"The garbage disposal did not include the discharge tube to the waste drain line. Instructions states ""Unit will not seal properly with old discharge tube."" I need to get this installed tomorrow. I'll figure something out.I'll be attempting to return it. Wish me luck."
4,I can feel the difference,I can feel the difference sitting next to the door where we have the kit installed. We had winds of 40-50 mph hour and it did not tear off like others have experienced. If I don't replace.the patio door this summer I will be getting another kit for next winter.
1,Here today / gone tomorrow,"I bought 6, yes, SIX of these. They looked great, were easy to install, but once the wind started to blow (Western Massachusetts) the covering slapped in the breeze and either ripped beyond repair, or were blown away for good. If you buy these, just say goodbye to your effort and about 20 bucks a window."
1,Save your money.,"I purchased this product for our patio door thinking it would be a safer option than the indoor alternative with a toddler in the house. I followed the instructions very carefully when I put it up, and thought it worked well for the week it stayed on. Last night, during the first winter storm of the season, it disappeared in the wind. If the point of the product is to provide insulation from winter weather, it has failed miserably! I am out time and money and will have to look for another option for insulating our patio door. I am very disappointed."
1,Worst product I've used in recent years,"So dissapointed in this product. Needed some covers I could see thru for the winter to cover my porch screens--5'X 5'.The first night I put on the film, the tape failed on one painted wood frame and 25% was loose by the next morning. By mid-day 50% was loose. The next day the film on the 2nd window was 50% loose. It stuck to the vinyl film, but came loose from the wood. So, put it back on both frames and then installed 1/8"" wood strips over the top of the film around the perimeter of the frame. So far so good. Surprised that 3M would put out such a poor product.The film is so thin, I wonder if it will hold up for one season"
2,No real Happy!,Does not hold up well in wind. Keeps breaking loose on the bottom. The tape should be stronger. When it was in place it did stop air.
1,It's ultrasonic,"The title needs to be changed, regardless if it uses laser for targeting. I almost made the mistake of ordering it, thinking it was a ""Laser Tape Measure"". It is not."
5,Haunting,"This film has haunted me deeply since I first saw it in 1987 at the age of 12. Cinematography, acting and direction each contribute to what is a beautifully crafted film. Such care and subtle attention to detail (both visual and aural) lead up to one of the most sublime endings in any film I have yet to see."
4,reissue for two good series,This is a reissue of Cait London: The loving season and Anne McAllister: Cowboys don't cry.Cowboys don't cry is a traditional cowboy - teacher combination but it has excellent moments when Tanner tries to fight against Maggie and surely loses all the time. The touching is the moment when Maggie starts calling him Tanner instead of Robert. Is everything lost then? Definitely worth a reissue.
2,Not for some of us....,I'd like to see a book written for those who know what they are missing - not from the perscpective of a virgin. This book was probably very helpful for those who are still waiting - but I believe that is probably a small majority.
2,Not recommended for older readers,"I gave this book as a gift without reading it first. Older readers, new Christians and/or those who are not virgins will probably see the author (almost 40 and still a virgin) as a source of curiosity rather than a source of inspiration. Better choices would be The Ten Commandments of Dating, The Black Single Christian's Guide to Dating & Sexuality and True Love in a World of False Hope."
4,Not What I Was Expecting,"I was interested in reading the book before I saw the movie, so I grabbed this off of Amazon - it is also worth noting that while I was an English major in college, this was my Jack Kerouac novel. To be frank, it wasn't what I was expecting. His cadence and run on sentences can be a bit difficult to read - in many ways, this is closer to reading someone's journal than to reading a novel. With that said, his story is definitely ""an American story"" about crossing the country and discovering yourself. While I don't know that I would ever re-read it, I would definitely say that it was worth reading once, if only to get a very deliberate taste of the Beat Generation."
2,The Cure for Insomnia,"I was able to get through the first 50 pages pretty easily, enjoying all the details of the trip. The next fifty though were harder because the details given don't really seem to add to the story. And beyond that, I just could t take it.I started skipping through the other chapters and parts trying to see if it got better with no success.The problem is that this is an account rather than an actual story. I'm sure we all know at least one person whom when you ask how their weekend was proceeds to give you every monotonous detail such as how they woke up on the wrong side of the bed, did their laundry, made a chicken salad, Zzzz....That is an account of their day not a story."
2,I'm not sure this one has aged so well,"I first read this when I was 19 (didn't we all?) I remember being fairly excited about it at that time. Maybe reading it in the ""scroll"" version has something to do with it (sometimes editors actually improve the author's manuscript), but 30 years later I've cooled on this considerably. Yes, there are passages which really grab you with their insight and beauty, but there's also WAY too much ridiculously dated ""go, man, go"" hep-cat nonsense. And, worse yet, long stretches of it are simply tedious. And, let's face it, the misogyny and homophobia read worse with each passing year."
1,This is a terrible waste of time,Not only is this audible almost 13 hours but also the audible is terrible to follow and a rough draft is a nice way of wording this massacre. It is a waste of money and time. Don't bother.
5,Very good time and product,I received the book in a good time fo abroad and it is perfect. The book is incredible and changes your mind and you life in avery pleasant way.
4,Dean is the best.,"If you feel like having a great travel read..who is a little nuts, you will enjoy this. I did."
3,Small texts + no spacing + large page = so hard to read.,"I wish spacing and paragraphing were better. I understand that they want to leave it in the original format, but if there's no indentation or line spacing, you should make the words bigger. I lost count how many times I couldn't find where am at. Burned my eyes out reading this book."
2,Not Compatible with advertised special Cuisinart DLC-5,"I gave a low rate for the DLC-5 processor, but, only meant to comment on the ""deal"" that is advertised today (special price when DLC-5 and disc holder are purchased together). These two items are incompatible.I have to return the disc holder and try to find something that will hold them without reverting to a piece of Tupperware."
3,"Imaginative, but not too interesting","I've read both books in this series and I'm not totally sold on all the hype. These books are OK, but not great. The premise is interesting and imaginative, but did hold my attention. I think the main problem is the author's confusing writing style. His main character is a stereotyped version of every other ""young hero with extraordinary powers, making his way through a dangerous world pursued by evil/politically motivated government/authoritative officials"", that we've seen countless times in modern SF. His supporting characters are weak and uninteresting. I like the initial book's premise in which the goo and the bad sides weren't so clear cut and the reader is still not sure if the hero is following the right path. With a little more attention to detail in the writing, this series might pan out in the end."
2,Urmmmm?,"I liked the first book. I started on the second book with great gusto. I got about halfway through and put it down. I was just confused. Too much plotting, too little detail on the plotting. It's a shame because in the first book I actually cared for the characters.The book is still unfinished. I still might pick it up later and try to undo the first impression!"
4,Catching Up On Fun....,"Rev-Ola's compilation of this ""studio"" group (two of whom were part of the core that was the Partridge Family's vocal sound) has less tracks than the Sundazed CD that's out-of-print, BUT it's more affordable than the Japanese ""Montage"" CD, so try it. Cheesy lyrics are out-paced by fine vocals and period arrangements, all sounding clear from original tapes. Good liner notes and pictures round up the dandy set."
3,A Bad Rap?,"Cowboy Troy is the real deal...Just because some redneck crawled out of his double wide and proclaimed ""this ain't country"" is no reason to discount Troy's efforts. Despite Nashville's conspiracy to package vanilla wafer country, ocassionally true originals slip through and tell it how it is. Cowboy Troy is one of those originals.CT has proven that there is a place for rap in country music in his cameo efforts with some big name acts. Perhaps his solo efforts haven't shown it yet, but some damn good musicians recognized his abilities and brought him on board.CT has brought a new fresh face and sound to an inbred genre that sorely needs some fresh blood. Kidd Rock mixed it up and we didn't hear ya'll whinin' and bitchen about that. Hell, everyone in my family rides and ropes and we listen Ozzy! Go back to your trailer and have another Bud, it matches your taste in music..."
5,good cd,"if you want to have great music from the movie nightmare on elm street, well this is one of them. With didfferent kinds of music and great music this CD is for you. If you want to have a CD that has all around great music get this CD."
4,hmm...,"I have ""freddy's favorites""and thought the three tracks by Badalamenti were good,but not his best work by far.I liked it,don't get me wrong,but am wondering if the rest of the score is actually worth the hefty pricetag offered here for a used copy.I'm somewhat of a Badalamenti completist and would love the music,but not if most of it's 80's cheese."
2,Joseph Marx-30 songs,The book is totally fine but I am very disappointed to know that the price on Amazon is more expensive than it's original price. Don't waste your money on this score. You will find better price at other online music store.
5,This is the best!!!!,I got this game expecting it to be another old sonic game. but when i started to play it. MMMMAAAANNNN it was awsome!!!!!!!!!!!! i reccomend this game to whoever like sonic!!!!
4,Sonic Heros,"I opened the box and the game had no scratches and was in very good condition. The game hasn't been played yet, because it is a gift for my boys for Christmas. The game looks good!"
4,Great Game!,"This game is great. The character switching is easy, the levels are really straight-forward (okay, not the pinball levels, which I hate with a passion), and it's easy to learn. Now, go! Go to the store, get this game, and play!"
1,DONT GET IT,ok look you cant spin dashknukles cant climetails cant tail whipno chao gardenand to much useles talkingif you are a sonic fan like me get the adventure seris
4,Threes Company,"I have been a giddy anxious kid all bout Sonic for 10 years. Im 12 now, and i really want this game so bad! Team Sonic, is Sonic, Knux, and Tails (which i HATE), Team dark, is Shadow (just a robotic clone of Shadow) E-Omega (NOT Gamma) and Rouge. Team rose is Amy, Cream, and Big, and Team chaotix, is Charmy Bee, Vector the crocidile, and Espio the chamaeleon.Pros-4 teams3 chars in eachImpressive GraphxNice muzikNO Chao! :D!!!!!Cons-the Team Blast move is very mediocre"
5,This Game kicks lemons,"i played the demo at walmart and this game kicks lemons the graphics rock the sound is cool and the special team moves are awesome!!!! I will definatley buy this game, and you should too,if u like games that kick lemons"
2,Frustrating and confusing.A very disappointing game.,"Ive played Sonic Adventure DX,Sonic Adventure 2 Battle and my favorite of all Sonic Mega Collection and was definitely not disappointed by any of them but this game is a different story.I mean I can accept that Sonic Team want to try new things with the Sonic characters but this game goes about it in all the wrong ways.The first 3 or 4 levels are pretty fun but after that it all becomes tedious and hard.I love a challenging game.I mean Ocarina Of Time is the best game Ive ever played because of all the challenges but that was a role playing game.A platformer should be challenging but not frustrating.It wrecks the whole experience but if youre really good at all sorts of games you might find that you like this.Thats the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.Its just OK."
2,3 person team is frustrating,"I wasn't happy with this game. The fact that you would be going fast in a level and then need to be abruptly stopped to change the character you were using. It would have been better if this wasn't required to move forward in the levels. Being an old time Sonic fan, I will probably be sticking to the old 2D version games since the new Sonic games just seem to be lacking."
2,"Promising, yet a mess.","This is one of Sonic's worst games. Surely, it was the worst one on the Nintendo GameCube. To say that it was disgraceful and glitchy is the serious understatement of the week.The character's charms and voice acting was there, but the soul wasn't. The levels were nice and huge as promised but there were many glitches and the story left so much to be desired. I think we loved this game for 2 weeks and then it hit us: THIS GAME IS SERIOUSLY STUPID.Cover Art: CInside Art: ?Story: DCharacters: A-Graphics: B+Sound: BControls: ALength: D-2.3 stars.Overall: D-"
1,[Boring],I bought this game (AS SONIC'S #1 fan) hoping sonic's multi platform debt was going to be a great game this is the worst sonic game EVER (stating as i own every sonic game) DO noy buy this game its a total wast of money!
4,What fun!,"6 yr old son loves it! He'd play it all day if we'd let him. 10 yr old daughter likes it, though not nearly as much. Lots of fun colors and sound. We're happy with our purchase of this game."
4,Awesome!,"Suprisingly, itz great. Team-up with characters to do many different jobs. Sonic, is known for his great speed, and can maneuver over crevices and holes and stuff by moving quickly from wall to wall, he also has a tornado move to blow away enemies with Xtreme-Force winds. Knuckles is known for his great power in conquering enemies and breaking walls. Tails, is the only one that can fly, wich is helpful in getting in hard to reach areas. at first i thought this game might be kind of stupid, but after playing it, it was great fun and suprisingly-good action. You can play 2-player mode and switch off with your friends. All in all, good game. Modern graphics, great compared to older Sonic games in the 90s. if ure 8 to 14 you'd probably enjoy it."
3,Great Game.,This game was okay.But what's up with no Chaos.I mean to me they make up 2/5 of the fun really sonic team next time make something with more exitement.Easier controls and Choa Garden!!!
5,STARS,The average is 3 stars because of people like you!! You forgot to fill in the number of STARS!! People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones!!
1,Screwed up Sonic,"If I were you I would rent this game first. From Sonic's first adventure on the genesis up till SADX Sonic was a huge hit. On my scale Sonic went from a 5 down to about a 3.5. Why did they even put knuckles on his team because he was his second worst enemy(first is Eggman,hehe) back in the early 90's. Sonic should always fly solo or with his best pal Tails and not flying around in weird formations and making fantasised attacks.If you still intend on getting a Sonic game on crack then rent this before you buy it."
1,The best game ever!,Any one who is a fan of sonic advencer 2 will love this game. The music is cool and the new speshel stages will make you look at other hand hed sonic games and see how easy it is get the chaos emerids! You have got to get this game! this is a must!
2,boring game,when I got this game I thougt it would be like one of the best sonic games ever! but it was one of the worst sonic games ever! the only thing I like on this game is two player mode and the bosses. So I do not have that much to say but that it is A very BORING sonic game!!!
3,Good game andcondition,"The condition of game, cover and guide, are all very good and gameplay is good for classic sonic players."
3,cons and pros,"Here are the pro's and cons.pros:Rail-flips have been improved from SA2air base level is awsomeMetal sonic RETURNS!!!the chaotix returnCG cutscreens are greatmusic is very goodless glitchey than sonic adventure 1 and 2pro or con:Enimies have more healthCons:not much of a storyshadow is a robot clonegraphics are preety weak in soo many levels.all teams have the same levles and bosses.the levels pervent from sonic running alotlevles, enimies and bosses are too easycan get boring and easy fast.can get finished very fast.Now I will tell you part of the story.The real eggman dosn't attack you but made the enimies, ships and the ultimute weapon. Metal sonic desquises himself as Eggman and attacks you. The air base is alot bigger than the air carrier. This is all I can tell you."
3,Fun for Sonic Fans,"I don't think Sonic Heroes is as good as the original games. It's not even as good as the Gamecube game that came before it, ""Sonic Adventure 2 Battle."" It is, however, a fun game for kids who like Sonic. The camera is pretty bad, like most 3D Sonic games, but if you can get past that the interesting new gameplay mechanics make for a fun title."
4,BEST GAME EVER!!!,Oh my gosh! I looove this game! I've been a Sonic fan since I played Sonic Adventure 2: Battle. This game rocks! I'm so glad that Shadow is back cuz he rocks! BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!
4,Pretty Good.,"I got this game for Christmas, AND IT ROCKS!!!The graphics are incredible. Everything else is great. The only thing missing is being able to play as a team chao.The missions get better and harder as you go.The order of places that the missions are in actually in a order that makes sense!!!You play as a team of three, with four teams to choose from.It also has a multi mode that is really neat.As you switch between each character, you gain new abilities,each team has a flyer, a speeder, and a powerhouse.I highly suggest this game."
5,Cracking No Brainer...,"I recieved Sonic Heroes for Xmas and have just started playing it recently over the past few weeks.Its a nice bright, fast, colourful game, a definite no brainer as you really don't have to think about anything except strategies to defeat the level boss.The graphics are great, the gameplay is great which is a good thing as anyone can pick up the control and easily be in command of Team (enter team name here).The characters voices do grate on the skin a little but you can skip by that easily enough.If you want a game thats exciting, fun, easy to pick up and play, visually stunning and fun for all ages, buy this (its a nice change from FPS's). This is not for you if you think all consol games should be the 'greatest ever' or for kids, but then again you may be pleasantly surprised...DO NOT PLAY after a hard night on the sauce - that is my only warning to you."
5,Sonic Heroes! Sonic Heroes!!,"Oh yeah, what a great game!!Team Sonic, Team Dark, Team Chaotix, Team Rose!This game is great, play as 3 characters! What stages, there incredible!The return to Metal Sonic!!!"
4,"Awesome game, buy it","This is one of the best Sonic games out there! The great thing is it's great in all aspects including music! the levels are fun yet challenging and there is a great replay value that wont leave you bored when you finish the game. There is a huge variety of players, attacks, and levels! If your looking for an action-platform-adventure game GET SONIC HEROES NOW!!!!"
5,"A graphical, colorful masterpiece.","I have always wanted this game; ever since it's release. But fopr some reason; I never seemed to get it. Every chance I had, something always went wrong. Wether Blockbuster wouldn't accept my membership card; or, I was short a few bucks. FINALY, after being out with my uncle; not even looking for it, I stumbled across it for $20! We bought it in a heartbeat! As soon as I came home, I started playing it. I was simply blown out of the water by its amazing graphics! It was so colorful! Not to mention the fun of playing it! The controls were perfect! I found it challenging, but not too bad to the point of frustration (exept on a few levels). Overall, this game is definitely worth buying for $20+, wether youre a die hard sonic fan, or new to the series.BUY THIS GAME! BUY IT NOW!"
5,Cool Sonic game,I played a demo of Sonic Heroes on the bonus Mario Kart double dash game and I loved it. (this is coming from a big sonic fan even with sonic stuffed animals(avalible on ebay))If you like sonic games this is great. You can play with 3 characters at a time and each have its own ability. I also suggest getting Sonic adventure 2 battle and Sonic adventure DX. (for those who played adventure 2 battle Shadow comes back!. These are also great and I have a feeling you wont be sorry for getting Sonic Heroes!Happy New Year!
3,Pros and Cons,"PROS-Better voices-Better music-Beautiful graphics-Enemies don't die after 1 hit-Levels are longer and more challenging-MultiplayerCONS-Camera angle still needs a bit of work-No Chao Garden-All of the teams go through the same levels-Pointless in-level dialogue (""Wow, my head's spinning!"" ""What a wild ride!"")-I don't think it's fair that they made Team Dark have the hardest stages. They're my favorite team, and their levels take like, 20 minutes to complete. And the boss battles... oh, the boss battles...-They brought Omochao back (but at least he doesn't stalk you in the levels this time)OVERALLThis game is wonderful and highly addicting, but it does have some flaws. But hey, nothing is perfect, right? I'd reccomend renting it before buying it. I congratulate the Sonic Team for making another great game, and even if it does have flaws, they can't do anything but keep getting better. I reccomend this game."
4,"Great selections, great translators","I have unfailingly found J.A. Van Buitenen to be both a true and interesting translator, this volume is no exception. It's a very comprehensive look at the subject matter, treated in such a way that it is accessible to the inexperienced Western reader, while leaving alot of meat left for the more accomplished reader. My one wish is to have a better idea of how the selections relate to the individual Purana books, and how they may be dated in history."
4,Popular Indian mythology,"The editor and translator of this book have done a good job selecting and translating the principal Puranas for the Western reader. The Introductions to the various settings clarify the ideas expressed in the selections and clear up ambiguities about names of Gods and Goddesses, etc. The ideas are presented dispassionately, not criticizing or comparing ancient Indian cosmological ideas to modern Western cosmology and science. The only thing I missed would have been a comparison between ancient Indian and Darwinian views on evolution, especially the origins of the human species."
2,"Nice, short, lots of good stuff left out.","The book appears to be well classified, but the style is condensed and doesn't look much Indian. If it weren't called a source-book, I would have given it better grades, thank you."
4,The new Jimi,"Hendrix lived in England, too. He also believed a black man should be able to play heavy guitar-based music. He was also misunderstood by his own people and deified by the vanilla media hip rightwing staff. These four tunes are brilliantly produced attacks on the outside world and Tricky will never get his props in this world. He could be the man to change hiphop, jungle and metal."
5,I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!,"TEMPEST IN EDEN is the love story of Shay Morrison, a nude model and Ian Douglas, a minister. They meet one weekend at the request of their newlywed parents(Shay's mother and Ian's father). What a weekend! The sexual tension was sky high and the verbal drawls were hilarious. No matter how different their careers and views are, nothing could stop their attraction from excalating into a full blown love of a lifetime. I deeply respected Ian's religious beliefs because even though he desperately wanted Shay, he did not succumb to temptation. I admired Shay for being so comfortable with her sexuality and proud of her career. It was wonderful to see these two unique people become two halves of a whole. Their characters grew throughout the book and learned to fully accept each other and compromise when it was needed. This is a wonderful read worth your time and money. You'll love it. Trust me!"
3,Sandra Brown,"One of her older books. Its a good, quick romance. Not the quality of her later writing but I always enjoy her books"
3,Awesome book,This was a very good read. As usual Sandra Brown did it again. A must read if your a fan. Had trouble putting it down.
2,Not Tempting Enough!,"What do you get when you cross a nude model and a minister? If you're Sandra Brown, you turn it into a love story. I enjoyed the roller coaster ride with Shay Morrison and Ian Douglas in this book. Somewhat typical of a romance novel from the early 1980's, but as with most of Sandra Brown's books, there are a few twists and turns along the way.TEMPEST IN EDEN is an enjoyable way to spend a few hours, but don't pick it up if you want to be captured in a story and not be able to put it down. This one definitely won't interfere with your schedule!"
3,Not great not bad...,The story starts when Shay walks in on Ian having a shower...she then attempts to seduce him but fails....but later they parted and Ian finally admitted his feelings for her....they have problems but it seems it is too easily solved... this book is thin on plot...the shortness of this novel makes it hard to elaborate on points and enchance the plot....This book is good for a light read when you just want to relax for an hour or two... but if you are looking for plot and complicated storyline this one is not for you... before you can get into the story it ends....The only thing i like about this book must be the hot minister...haa
4,Better than what I expected,"After being invited to spend a weekend with her mother, new stepfather and step brother, Shay accidently walks into the bathroom just as her stepsbrother steps out of the shower. Ian is a mintster in a staid town and he imediently dislikes Shay. So Shay sets out to seduce her stepbrother but the end resoulte of the seduction is differernt than what she thought."
2,wasn't up to her usual standards,I usually enjoy Sandra Brown's books but I didn't really like these characters. I thought they were both very cliched. Shay also gave in to Ian's demands about her work. She shouldn't have given in to him.
5,Fantastic,The author has found a way to explain the unknowable and the unimaginalbe in such a way that you begin salivating at the possibility of a direct experience. I highly reccommend this book to anyone seeking spirituality.
5,Great machine,"I purchased this machine for a food kitchen in Victoria, Tx. It has already received a punishing number of days. I personally have the 14 cup Cuisinart and have no problems bragging about it.At the kitchen, six days a week, this machine is used by any number of persons on a daily basis, some not fully knowlegable of the commercial Cuisinart 20 cup. At this time there are no problems and I do not foresee any.Thanks"
2,won't stay in your ears,you'd really need to make sure you cap is covering your ears... i know mine budges once in a while...and then i end up with just one headphone at the end of the lap... quite annoying...
3,aquapac waterproof earphones,"These headphones work great when they are working. They have great sound and the earphones are very comfortable. However if you are doing more than laying on a raft then these aren't for you. They don't stay in my ears and I have to stop every lap or so to blow the water out and replace them in my ears. The cord gets in the way also, when swimming laps."
4,Inspired and charming,"I was led to this because I learned that the main theme of this film largely inspired the title music to STAR WARS. Give it a listen and you'll hear how this is clearly so. But both are different and wonderful, and this whole score is charming."
1,Does not fit all E series,I have a 1998 Rainbow E series and this filter does not fit. I am returning it and getting the disposable type. Rainbow vacumn cleaner are great. Growing up as a kid my friends mom had one and still has it to this day. Im 50yrs old so I know its at least 45 years old and still works.
3,Filter looks cheaper than the original,The filter is cheaper than the orig. one - the density of the inner filter is not as good as original
2,Very Hard to Clean,Mine has always worked well but I've quit using it because it's so difficult to clean. I got mine free after purchasing something else and I loved the way it chopped food but never felt like it was clean enough and wondered about food safety. It's sitting in a cupboard and I'm trying to find something to replace it but none of the mini choppers seem to get very good ratings.
3,Not what I expected,"I really like Cuisinart products and I had hoped to use the mini mate for small kitchen jobs, such as mincing garlic--something I do a lot of. So I was disappointed to find it awkward to use; however, I have used it only once since receiving it. The motor housing sits on top of the work bowl without locking into place and it is difficult to tell if the blade/shaft assembly is placed correctly on the post at the bottom of the work bowl. Perhaps with use I will feel more comfortable with it."
4,Very good grinder,"I have had this grinder for over a month. So far, it works pretty well, especially when I have to grind a lot of ingredients for Asian cuisine. The only cons is that the top is not washable, so it takes a little bit time to rinse and wipe. Otherwise, it is a great product."
5,Almost perfect,"I use my Cuisinart Mini Mate Chopper almost every day to mince garlic. Yes, it throws some pieces on the top, which requires wiping it out or rinsing quickly to not get water in the motor. BUT it is perfect for small quantities-one to 10 cloves, as well as ginger, etc. The 2 blade shaft parts came apart after many dishwashings, but I just used superglue to put the two parts back together.I just ordered another Mini Mate for our vacation home, after buying several larger (but as small as possible) more expensive choppers that just don't work well for small jobs.Terrifically handy, and a great time saver."
1,Grossly Inferior Product,"I bought this for my wife to chop nuts in. She used it according to the instructions, mostly for chopping walnuts. It died within a couple weeks. I went to the manufacturer's web site and filled out the online contact form, to ask about returning it to them for replacement. They didn't even bother to respond to my request.If you are looking for a product with durability, I recommend that you avoid Cuisinart, or at least this particular product for sure.ww"
4,So handy,Great grinder for spices and garlic. This was a replacement for the one I bought in the mid-80's; that one had a crack in the lexan bowl but it still worked!
3,This product was good while it lasted. It is the one I replaced recently,See comments above. It tells me that seventeen more words are required. I can not imagine why the computer needs more words. What I said is all that is necessary.
1,Don't Buy it,"My first Mini Mate died within 60 days because a metal piece fell of it. The replacement I received (pay attention, you pay shipping for sending it and a 10$ check) broke after being used twice."
4,Great chopper!,"I love this chopper. I use it to chop all kinds of spices and nuts. Just one advice: Don't use it to grind star anise. My chopper is now permanently colored brown and a part broke. However, it still works!"
1,Very shoddy quality,"My mini-mate died after being used a few times, and producing inconsistent results. I shipped it to Cuisinart, paid for return shipping, and the thing did not run even once! I threw it away - Cuisinart should be ashamed of putting out such a shoddy product under its brand name, and of the shoddier repair service (I am not alone as you can see below)."
1,Died after 2 uses,"I loved the functionality of this little processor and the fact that it takes up so little counter space. It did a great job making pesto for 2, and the texture was perfect. I was SO disappointed when the motor died after 2 uses. After reading the other reviews here, I won't waste additional money returning it to Cuisinart. I agree with the reviewer who wrote they should be ashamed of putting their name on such a poor quality product."
1,Bummer!,"This unit burned out the VERY FIRST time I used it. Nor was I rough with it in any way. Unfortunately, the first time I used it was just past 30 days from my Amazon purchase, so Amazon.com won't take it back. From reading other reviews, I can see that this has happened to several other buyers. Evidently you pay $10 shipping on a $20 item to send it back to Cuisinart. Wish I'd read the reviews before buying -- this not-so-nifty little item is now in my trash."
1,Unacceptable,"We thought we loved this little guy. It's way quieter than the old grinder we've been using and seemed to grind to a fine powder. However, the motor burned out after just a few uses. Thinking it was defective, we exchanged it for a new one, and the same thing happened within a month. We didn't grind anything extraordinary or continue to activate it when jammed or anything like that. It just simply seems incapable of performing the function for which it was designed without self-destructing."
4,How can you live without one. Cuisinart mini matechopper,"This is the third of these little wizards we have owned. they are fabulous for chopping herbs, nuts and small amounts of most veggies. I use it daily so they usually last 3 to 4 years. Wash it immediately in warm soapy water and just wipe housing with a damp paper towel. As usual the Amazon price was spectacular and it arrived very quickly."
4,Great for grinding spices,This grinder is great for spices. It makes powder of whole seeds quickly. It can also run for several minutes at a time without overheating (unlike my old grinder) which is great for doing larger quantities for bulk cooking. Cleanup is good but not great as seems to be common with all the grinders I've tried. Getting it all put back together such that the safety button is pressed is a little tricky. Overall it's worth the $20 I spent on it and is superior to my last grinder.
2,cuisinart mini chopper,"Disappointing. I had one of these for years and used it almost everyday. When the motor finally gave out, I ordered a new one. When I use cottage cheese in it, it leaks out over the side. It never did that with the old one. All the printing (Cuisinart, etc) has smeared off. I'm thinking it's a copy or a refurbished item which is not how it was represented on the Amazon site."
1,Not worth the hassle,"Horrible to clean.When putting food in, blade must be inserted first or else you can't get the blade in. But be careful not to put any food over where the blade fits into the top of the machine or else you can't close the machine.Ultimately the bottom of the plastic cup broke and chopper is now dead.Cuisinart says they'll replace if I can provide a receipt for proof of purchase - yeah right."
1,Never received,"I was very disappointed with the company, since this item was never delivered. I have yet to see the refund, either."
3,Good for chopping but hard to clean,"I use this for making baby food and it is great little helper. Only complaint is that since the wires are attached to the top piece that is used to chop, when cleaning it you end up getting water into the wiring part and would have to make sure it is very dry before using it. I just used it before , and guess I didnt' let it dry properly because it started to 'smoke' from the wiring part."
2,Useless after a few uses,Worked quite well until the blade mechanism broke after a few uses and the replacement part from Cuisinart is way too expensive when you factor in the part + shipping/handling. This has been the case with many Cuisinart items so I am no longer a fan of any products made by the company.
2,So-so,I used the older version of this mini chopper for about 15 years and expected this new updated version to be as good as or even better than my old one. Not so much. This one's motor is not nearly as strong and its larger size makes it awkward to hold. It's also tricky to fit the two pieces together to make it run.
1,Poor quality,"The first one I ordered did not work so I returned it for a replacement. I have used this one, perhaps, 10 times. Last night I could not remove the blade. It remains stuck. I would never recommend this product to anyone."
2,Good until it died,This product worked awesome and then after a few weeks it died. I would not recommend this product unless you only plan on using it a few times!!
1,More Chinese Landfill,"Tried to make almond butter in this thing.It lasted about 4 minutes before it burned out,even when following directions stating that it should not be used continually but in brief intervals. Its no wonder our land fills are getting filled up so fast........"
2,Not so great,"I have had two of these choppers, unfortunately! The first I used all the time for baby food, salsa, and other small jobs, but it died about the time my son was ready for me to stop pureeing things. Disappointed (and just past the warranty), I mentioned it to my sister who bought me the second for Xmas. I rarely used this one and sure enough, right after the warranty period it died. I was trying to chop almonds this time and it only created a fine powder of some, leaving huge chunks. Then it died, smoking. Also, this is VERY hard to get clean when you're making sauces and such; I don't think food safety is very good when you can't wash something in hot water and soap (the top comes in direct contact with food). Get something else."
1,Unbelievable,"This chopper is just unbelievable. The blades aren't even sharp and it just mushes up the food no matter what you try. It dosen't even puree very good either. And it broke after very little use. Cuisinart makes excellent full-size food processors but sad-quality small ones. The whole point in having a chopper is so that it will chop! not mash everything up! And as far as i'm concerned I could care less about these supposed choppers because none of them really work. It's best to just chop up vegetables normally with a knife unless you want mashy, juicey clumps of food. One more thing, it made a hell of a mess."
4,Good for small batches of baby food,"I used this item to make homemade babyfood for my twins. It was awesome, even though I wish it had a larger capacity. For the price, it was well worth it. Ours broke though because my husband decided to use it to crush ice (not smart) while I was out one day.Anyway, use it for what it was designed. If you want crushed ice, this is not the product for you! :)"
3,Okay for minimal use,"I used this mini grinder as a baby food maker. Despite light use, I had to call the manufacturer and have my unit replaced. Apparently, the motor burned out. The second one I got has been fine, but I've only put VERY SOFT food in it.Another problem is cleaning the workbowl. The top of the workbowl is the bottom of the motorhousing, so it cannot be put in the dishwasher or even immersed in water. This makes proper sanitary cleaning difficult."
1,Unhappy with this chopper,"First of all, you can only put very small amounts in of onions, etc. Even then, it doesn't chop evenly. Only some of the onion gets chopped. Then you have to separate the chopped parts from the unchopped parts. As far as celery goes, it doesn't chop it, it pulverizes it into liquid practically. And this in only a few seconds. I was very unhappy with this chopper. Hopefully I can find a real chopper someday!"
3,Interesting story,Subtitles were short sentences so not too difficult to watch and read. Strong young boys with strange father. Worth watching
3,"Stunning, but unsatisfying","Since a synopsis is redundant, I'll go straight to the review. Though at times resembling Madonna's ""Frozen"" video, the beautiful shots that linger a few seconds too long and the quiet, tense atmosphere that speaks loudly about the tension between the characters make for an intriguing film. The mystery of the father's return also draws you into finishing the film through to the end, in spite of the lulls in the action.Unfortunately [for some], the openended-ness of the film's conclusion leaves an unsatisfying taste in your mouth. I tend to like films that leave you thinking in the end, but for this film, the ambiguity was a bit too much. I was greatly invested in the sons, wonderfully played by two very talented young actors, and wanted to see how their story played out.So if you're looking for a tidy ending, go elsewhere. But if you're looking for a beautiful postcard of Russia and a glimpse into the complicated workings of father-son relationships, check this film out."
4,More than meets the eye,"Having heard in advance that the director is a devotee of Tarkovsky, I was expecting to be baffled, and was, at least in part. At first watching, the movie comes across as ""National Lampoon's Siberian Vacation"", but I don't think that was the intention! Some things I wish I had been told before seeing it... pay attention to the days of the week (there's evidently some sort of Passion of Christ symbolism going on). Note the fish, white birds, a 3-day trip, etc... If you figure it out, let me know!"
2,The Return,"""The Return"", like a film that teeters between between being serious or being funny, or food that dangles between being sweet or salty, or music that can't decide whether to be primarily jazz or primarily classical, delights in not making up its mind. Is this film about the tensions, pain, longing and love of a father for his sons, his sons for his father? Or, is it a mystery film about ""what's in the box?"" buried on a deserted island by a man we know nothing of, but wish we knew more of. And, just how does this mystery of this man, his past, his behavior, his actions, connect with the message of two boys who long to understand their father more? The boys are not alone at the end of the film as they try to figure out what just happened."
3,Slow to Unfold,"A dramatic slice of life in modern day rural Russia, characterized by exceptional child-acting. The plot, itself, however, is rather thin and slow to unfold; it is clearly overshadowed by majestic scenes of natural beauty on land and sea. Filmed with English subtitles."
3,Really quirky,"I was so scared for those two boys. The story line was simple enough to follow but I found myself saying ""What was the Mother thinking""? I couldn't figure out where they were going. I knew deep down inside that it was not just a fishing trip.It was gripping and yet a slow pace until the end."
5,Just Beautiful!,"It's the first Zvyagintsev movie, and its almost perfect. Every emotions are in ""The Return"". The story look simple - 2 kids go to a trip with their father who's back from a very long absence - but, in this simplicity, you can find how hard it is to trust somebody we don't really know...Give a try to this wonderful movie...my favorite for a while."
2,That's it? really?,"Not great, not even really good. If you're one of those people who hate ""bad"" endings, better skip it. I mean bad in the way you might be left hanging, wondering.... Hate that! The cinematography wasn't all that exciting, the landscape rather dreary, but I suppose most of Russia is that way. The boys did an outstanding acting job, that's about the one good thing about this movie. Makes ya kinda wonder about all those RAVE reviews.Two hours I can't get back."
2,Boring,"I'm going to have to disagree with the majority of the reviews on this movie. I have seen plenty of Russian films, and many of them have been slow and entirely reliant upon the emotional component. Mikhalkov, for example, is a director who can do this. This movie suffers from pretentious screenwriting, and a lack of underlying meaning or moral lesson. although the acting isn't necessarily bad, you don't get attached to the characters. I got the feeling that the cinematography and the colors didn't match the movie's theme and plot. At times it got so boring that i wanted to stop watching, even though i never do that. Anyway, I do not recommend this movie. IF you want to watch some good russian movies, go with ""Brother"", ""Burnt By The Sun"", ""Prisoner of THe Mountains"", ""War"", or ""Unfinished Piece for the Mechanical Piano"""
5,first rate thriller; Michael Crichton move over for Preston!,"I won't discuss the plot suffice to say that it's about finding a complete T-Rex fossil and the battles to steal this $100,000,000. prize. Preston has done a great job with plot and characters continuing the story of Tom Broadbent from The Codex. He adds a former CIA agent who's about to become a monk and a host of interesting well-developed characters you learn to hate. This is a very good story....well worth your time. Buy it!!!!!!!!"
5,Bought this PM and just finished the book.,"Outstanding book because its believable and thoroughly entertaining! My first time with Douglas Preston. Picked it up on a whim at the bookstore today, then absolutely could not put it down. There are several interwoven plots and the actions, even the science, is believable. A fast easy read.If you like adventure books and want something to light up your brain for a while, then go for Tryannosaur Canyon.Thanks,Jim Burke"
5,A lot of fun!,"This book is a load of fun! I picked it up at a grocery store, where it sat, a remaindered fossil, for a lousy $1.50. Usually, I won't read fiction that's too popular, preferring history/biography/science and noir detective stuff a la James Crumley, Charles Willeford, John D. MacDonald, et al, and the always humorous Charles Portis, in between. But, after enjoying the latest biography of Andrew Jackson and a book about the cholera epidemic in 19th Century London, I though I owed myself a respite from the serious and an escape into imagination. ""Tyrannosaur Canyon"" was just the ticket. Do yourself a favor: get it and read it. I'm looking for a copy to send to my Tucson geologist brother for Christmas. Can't send him my copy because I'll want it on my shelf next to my collection of Chrichton. It's as much of a good time away from reality but, as much and at once, a lesson in it. If nothing else, its one that also tends to clean the pallet for the next round of knowledge."
3,Good read,"Tyrannosaur Canyon was an enjoyable read. It was well written, good plot and interesting characters, the only drawback was that towards the end it becames predictable. However I thought that Douglas Preston has something to offer to the reader and I do look forward to his next novel."
2,Boring,"I actually liked the plot of this book but the writing style was terribly boring. It had paragraph after paragraph of sterile description that added no value to the reading experience and failed to propel the story forward. It had the potential to be a page turner but instead constantly left me thinking ""get on with it""."
3,"Not great, but not bad.","I had never read Preston before I bought this book. I bought it because the blurbs on the cover compared him favorably to Michael Crichton.Douglas Preston is no Crichton.The story was...ok...but nothing special. The originality of the idea was overshadowed by the fact that I continuously wanted to slap some sense into the main character. The bit about ""I made a promise to a dying man"" was just silly to me.Anyway...to summarize...a really good idea that just (for me) did not work."
1,HOW?,How can someone write such great storys with a partner and then write crap by himself. I am sorry but i have been reading books my whole life and it just seems that the caliber of writing and plotting has gotten worse over the years. This is not even an idea worthy of a story! If this were a movie i would demand my money back at the ticket office. Mr. Preston quit writing storys alone!
2,Tyrannosaur Canyon moves at the speed of Fossilized bones!,"The story started well enough, with the mysterious discovery of blood red colored sand on the moon, and came back to Earth with the murder of a Dynosaur hunter who had found the remains of a Tyrannosouras Rex in the desert. The Story then sunk into complete boredom as Tom Broadbent from Codex attempts to find the daughter of the murdered man, and finds himself in the gunsights of the man's murderer, along with a host of other periferal characters unnecessary to this boring novel.I gave Codex five stars because it was at least interesting, and adventurous, this one I give two stars, because the author plods along, with all the many characters, and nothing interesting happens to them! At least not in the first half of the book!It's about as exciting as watching paint dry, or ice melt!Try Codex instead, or any one of James Rollins's books, if you like adventure stories with some action!"
3,good mind candy,"A murder for hire, and you soon learn that a creepy paleontologist is involved. What is this notebook, and what do the numbers mean? The story picks up from there and soon involves an ex-CIA monk, an NSA agent with a license to kill, a cute research assistant, a hired gun, a kidnapping, an investigation, and possibility of global catastrophe. And, of course, our hero and heroine, an unassuming couple with a past who rise to the challenge.This book is very readable...nothing great but a good novel with which to pass the time.I probably would have given it 4 stars, but all of the quotes on the cover compared it to Jurassic Park, so I was expecting dinosaurs. There are no dinosaurs (at least, no live dinosaurs interacting with people)."
3,10 ounces in a 14 ounce package.,"This was a really fun read, and with a twist at the end that leaves open the possibility of a very interesting sequel. While I did really enjoy this book, I do have a fairly important complaint. The last page of the book is numbered 365. But there are far from 365 pages of text between the covers. Each chapter starts with about a quarter of a page of white space at the top. And many chapters end with more than a half page of white space. Then the next chapter starts, as noted with another quarter page of white space. Since many, many chapters are very short (some less than a full page), this results in much too much white space. I'd estimate that if the white space was closed up, the total number of pages would be about 275. This is like buying a 14 ounce box of cereal that only has 10 ounces in it. The cereal may be really good, but it's still a rip-off."
3,CHILDLESS PRESTON,"When Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child team up, they're top notch works: RELIC, RELIQUARY, ETC. When they go alone, they're not as sharp. In TYRANNOSAUR CANYON, Preston goes it alone to weave a pretty derivative and predictable thriller that has implausible scenarios and wooden characters. The main thrust of the plot involving the discovery of a remarkably preserved T Rex gets lost in an endless chase scene, government shenanigans and technical mumbojumbo. It takes Preston forever to tie in the opening sequence involving the theft of a moonrock with the discovery of the dinosaur, and the ending is hopelessly cheery. Also the ""thriller"" misses the mark in the most essential ingredient for thrillers: thrills. The pedestrian pace and uninnovative plotting hardly generate any real suspense. Stick to the duo."
3,Not Bad But Not Great...,"I found this Douglas Preston book to be merely average. I normally enjoy the Preston/Child books, but this book dragged. There were two stories in one book. Tracking the dinosaur to its finally resting place, and the laboratory work to discover the secrets behind the dinosaur. The laboratory story I found tedious and too long. As in most of these books of this genre, the characters are, for the most part, two dimensional. The end was particularly disappointing. Supposedly highly trained special operations soldiers do the opposite of what they were expected to do. I didn't believe that part of the story for a moment. Close but no cigar, sorry!"
4,An Enjoyable Read,"This is well-wrought fiction populated by interesting characters, a fast-moving plot and a vivid sense of the Southwest."
4,A wonderful adventure . . .,". . . with some truly interesting characters.""Tyrannosaur Canyon"" was the first Douglas Preston novel I had ever read. (A situation now rectified!) I'm very glad that I did!This is an exciting, fast-paced book which is part ""hard science"", part mystery, and part ""just plain adventure""! From Apollo 17 to the Museum of Natural History in New York to the American Southwest, this search for the greatest archaeological find of all time never lets up.The characters are well developed (both the good guys and the villians) and the plot is believable. Indeed, the storyline will grab you and will not let you go until the final page has been turned. And, unlike many pure ""adventure"" stories -- the book will cause you to thinkA thoroughly enjoyable experience."
4,Excellent Plot. Unfolded Beautifully,"This was an excellent story. I truely enjoyed reading this novel. For several years i have been reading Preston and Child books, each book is filled with wonderful fiction that consistently intrigues me. Tyran Canyon started very interesting and quickly picked up the pace. The plot unfolded in a exciting way that wouldn't allow me to put this book down. The character development was great, going from one storyline to the next was an excellent cliffhanger that made me want to find out more, more, more!Great work....you all will enjoy this book..."
2,Plot full of holes,"Did I miss something, or did this guy risk his life based on a promise to someone he just met? Too much irrational behavior to mention. I had to force myself to finish the book just to see how much more ridiculous it could get. The (paperback) cover refers to Michael Crichton three times, the praises inside, another three, and one reference to Stephen King. These are two good authors that I enjoy reading but this book was not even close."
4,Good but a bit slow at times,"Not that I require non stop action but there were some parts that just didnt seem to suit any purpose. Still a solid read, most of the books by this author or his common co author (Licoln Child) are very good."
3,Another Fast-Paced Thriller for Hours of Amusment,"A lot of people review these books thinking they were picking up Dickens or Poe. These thrillers are designed to be barely-plausible, made-for-movie adventures for people to escape the real world for awhile. I'm not saying this is bad, no this is just the type of books these are. This book followsThe Codexand carries over two characters, but that book has nothing to do with this one (no need to read it first, but it is good as well). The whole motivation of the story isn't something that is going to awe you, but it is enough to feed the improbable adventure and most likely set the stage for another. A decent, well-crafted read. Interested in real secrets of the southwest? TryLost Cities & Ancient Mysteries of the Southwest. And if you think uranium is ""safe"" like one of the ""experts"" in Tyrannosaur Canyon, try the nonfictionYellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed."
5,top notch,"Awesome reading , can't put it down. Keeps you wanting more. Douglas Preston is my new favorite author!"
3,Smart people doing dumb things...,"Yes, like others who have reviewed this book, it is hard to believe that a millionaire vet would lie to the police and risk his life for a dying poacher's last escapade. And that is just the beginning. Putting logic aside, there is still lots of action, atmosphere, and the sympathetic characterization of an under-employed female PhD. A good read for a plane flight, trip to the beach."
4,"Solid, not spectacular, entry from Douglas Preston","While, not as much of a page-turner as ""The Codex"", ""Tyrannosaur Canyon"" is a good read that will appeal to the fans of Preston and Child. Reuniting Tom And Sally Broadbent (from ""The Codex"") was a welcome decision for this reviewer. Both characters are well-drawn and interesting.The plot takes off when Tom stumbles upon a dying prospector who hands him a small notebook filled with coded figures. The prospector asked Tom to give the notebook to ""Robbie"". The next 300+ pages are filled with Tom's attempt to return the notebook while at the same time tying to solve the mystery left behind by the prospector.Spectacular scenery and interesting gadgets abound in this book. Preston even manages to mix in a little government conspiracy and a ""black ops"" group in the quick-moving plot.Through not necessarily a memorable novel, fans of the genre' and of Preston and Child will no doubt want to add ""Tyrannosaur Canyon"" to their ""must read"" list."
5,Highly Entertaining!,This is a great mystery novel. I couldn't put it down and read it in two days. I passed in on to my husband who read it in a couple of days too. My teenage daughter also read it in a matter of days. One book and we all thoroughly enjoyed reading it. We had a wonderful time discussing it too.
2,Technical aspects interesting; Character actions horrific,"Tyrannosaurus Canyon is pretty interesting at times. Preston evokes a fairly decent Michael Crichton imitation when it comes to the technical aspects of the story, dinosaur knowledge, etc.The problem is that the character motivations for their actions are absolutely absurd.Why did Tom go on this quest for someone he never met before?Why did Coirvais strike up a relationship with a crazy person in prison?Why did the monk stop being a monk to help Tom?Plus, every character was amazingly capable of walking hundreds of miles with like two Dixie cups filled with water in 110 degree heat."
2,Boring and uninspired.,"This book has ""paycheck book"" written all over it. Rushed, boring, and almost insultingly simple in terms of character and dialogue. The book's not terrible, but I am glad I bought it used and cheap."
3,"Good read, weak plot","I actually enjoyed the book. However, the premise and overall plot was a bit weak, especially the ending. Charecter development was good."
1,Too small a font to read!,"Well, I really like Douglas Preston's novels, but 3 chapters into this hard cover, I'm straining to read this incredibly small typefont, and wondering why in the hell any publisher would put out a hardback with such a small font. It is smaller than the average paperback. Stupid design, indeed."
3,"Decent beach read, but keep your expectations moderate","TC isn't a bad effort, and the descriptions of NM scenery are great -- reminiscent of the team's better books, _Thunderhead_ and _Mount Dragon_. Here, Preston bites off a bit more than he can chew, introducing a significantly complex plot device that he resolves only half-heartedly and not entirely believably. Other reviewers have it right when they identify the search-for-the-fossil plot as a macguffin: you could easily substitute any lost and/or disputed item (an art treasure, a forgotten city, a missing atomic bomb, etc.) and the other elements of the book could remain essentially the same. A fast and enjoyable vacation read, but heavily formulaic. I can't help but think that Preston does his best work as part of a team."
3,Tyrannasauer Canyon,Methinx I prefer the books that are written by Child & Preston. Perhaps it's the wide assortment of characters carried thru their books. I've read a couple of singles by both of these authors but much prefer them as a team. This particular book had some grandeur to it but the insertion of the military was a bit much.
4,I couldn't put it down,"The MarginMy favorite reading is mystery and intrigue. My favorite pastime is archaeology and paleantology. Preston's book grabbed me from the begining, because it has all those elements and more.Stem Weathers found what he'd been looking for, he was estatic, and that's what got him killed at Chama Bend. Dr. Broadbent, a local veternarian heard the shots and reined his horse in that direction. When Broadbent located Weathers bleeding to death, the old man pushed a notebook into his hand and made a dying request that the book be delivered to his daughter. The vet and his wife become embroiled in a succession of mysterious and terrifying events.Tyrannosaur Canyon is well worth your time.Marvin Wiebener, author of The Margin"
3,Tyrannosaur Canyon,"By Douglas Preston...not his best work but entertaining reading. Didn't hate it, didn't think it was great...just entertaining. The concept was intriguing, just left me wanting a little more. He's great when writing with Child!"
5,Fabulous!,"Baku is fantastic! I spent quite a bit of time backpacking around the world in my twenties and it really shaped my view of the world. When my kids came along, I wanted to share world experiences with them at a young age and Baku definitely helps. The kids love him - he's goofy yet cultured and shares his travel and world friendships.A must for any parent who wants to share world cultures with their kids. Looking forward to episode 2!"
3,Mom of a 4 yr old,"Baku is short only 30 minutes and he (the bug) only travels to someones house, where they meet people from india, lebanon, etc. They don't really travel to a foreign country and interact with the people there, instead they are at home and people from 3 different countries visit them and talk about the food/clothing/dance. Try the library for this one."
5,Smokey Book rocks,The Smokey the Bear books are always a big hit around children and adults. I used it in school and around campfires.
2,Too old fashions,Unless old fashion comes back these books are useless. I think that is why the library discarded them them all.
4,Don't give up,"We recently purchased this seat. Our baby is currently 13 lbs and 26 inches long. We had to go to this seat due to his length. The salesman at Babies R Us was helpful is demonstrating that the padding around the baby's head is the same material used in football helmets. It is still taking me time to get used to all of the straps, and I am having to use my stroller more since I do not have the use of the baby carrier(seat). My husband seems to like this seat a lot. Advice: Before you buy a car seat go ahead and purchase a sun shade for your back window. We put the car seat in the car, and before we could leave the parking lot I was back in the store buying a sun shade."
4,Perfect Fit!!,"I found this car seat to be wonderful in all but one way. My son is only three months old and already weighs 15 pounds; a big boy. He is about 24 inches in height, so he is not very long, but the seat fits him perfectly with room to grow. It's cushioned so that I'm sure he gets a great ride and not a sore bottom.The five point harness is safe and easy to get him in and out of quickly. The quick adjusting height of the shoulder staps is great when he needs to wear a thick coat one day and just a sweater the next; no hassel.The seat reclines in five different positions...which is great since he is still a newborn and cannot sit up.The only drawback of this car seat (as is any other toddler car seat) is that unless you have very dark back windows, your baby is blinded by the sun since the seat does not have a sun canopy atttached. Other than that, I highly recommend this seat to any mommy (or daddy); whether you have a tiny newborn or a toddler!!"
3,Hard to adjust and poor quality,"We thought this was going to be the perfect seat, however after a couple of weeks use we found the edging had fraid and the sponge foam was ill fitted at the sides, and the Diamond material is not the best to use for a car seat.We found it hard to adjust the seat angle as well as the release button to enable the straps to be adjusted was quite ackward. It does appear that paying more for an item doesn't necessarily mean that it is better quality."
2,Disappointed in this product,"I recently purchased this seat for my son. He is still in the rear facing position, and I liked the features the seat offered. I was able to install this seat quite easily, and it's as tight as can be, with a little help from a ""mighty tight"". That's where my positive experience ended. I don't like the harness and it's design. The straps are already twisting and the plastic loop in the seat back where the harness goes through does NOT lay flat. I find it difficult to get the harness properly on him, and find myself regreting this purchase everytime I use the seat. My husband HATES the seat and tells me everyday to go get a new one and throw this one out. ... I wouldn't suggest this seat to anyone."
4,Spectra spectra spectra,Great if this is the topic you are looking for. Spectra of diatomic molecules are hard to interpret if you dont have the right resources. Also very useful in physical chemistry lab classes.
2,Okay movie,"It was a good movie, i had to watch it for a history class i was taking. I dont think i will watch it again though. Not what i am in to."
5,Well done,"Historically correct, with good action and excellent story. Great actors and filmed in locations that seem to fit the period. Highly recommend."
4,Ahabit,Very good period peace of early America showing how father and son survive up and downs in life of war
4,More authentic than most,"In comparison to movies such as The Patriot and The Crossing, Revolution starring Al Pacino as Tom Dobb, is a much more authentic account of the American Revolution. For Dobb, the war doesn't concern him, but he finds himself swept up in the events after his son foolishly enlists. Eventually they desert, but soon Dobb comes to realize the importance of the struggle, and becomes a willful participant. Yet in the end, his struggle and sacrifice is compensated with broken promises and a paltry wad of devalued specie."
4,A different style to a different time,Well if you want a spectacle click on BEN HUR or the PATRIOT. If you want to see a gritty film about a gritty world then this movie is it. The first battle scene is a fine one and Donald Sutherland's character makes the movie much better. Unlike other movies this time is shown as the dirty world that it was populated by men not saints. The reluctant hero Pacino is believeable but maybe an unknown would have been better here. A better movie that the critics or the box office painted it.
1,not that good.,"I don't recommend it. Hokie and full of holes. I'm not saying the patriot was a work of historical significance, but this is not to the revolutionary war what ghettysberg was to the civil war. This was not a good movie. Save your $2.99 and watch something else."
4,Unique,"I love this film..True it seems a story of 1970's (An anti-war take on the American revolution )but the photography is so very good in this film it is pure eye candy to watch.Donald Southerland is parliculary great to watch as he plays a very complex and amazing character known as Sgt Major Bill Peasly-He all but steals the show in the film and it is Bill Peasly I am left thinking most about in this film.The last tragedy of this film is the soundtrack-what happened to such a great soundtrack-can't find it anywhere.Revolution is certainly a work worth purchasing, viewing as Pacino is great to see in a different role then his normally foul mouthed gangster roles but rather as a loving father in this film."
3,added narration needs to be deleted,"I loved this movie the first time around. The ""Revisited"" version adds narration that is distrating, unnecessary, and often covers up the actual dialogue in the film. I no longer desire to purchase this film; the narration is that bad."
2,"Terrible ""Revisit"" to a movie that was good already","I am disgusted with this re-release. I'm watching it now and I'm so mad I had to start reviewing already. The constant narration in this new version is beyond annoying. It covers up other dialog and sounds that you could hear in the original version, and it distracts from the Pacino's performance--he was very capably getting his character's thoughts across without it! They've cut other scenes as well. I will update after it is over, but I'm already looking for a copy of the original. Unsuccessfully, so far. :("
3,i enjoyed it,"This film is worth watching. Not remotely as bad as many of these reviews state. I see it as a ""Thin Red Line""-style take on Revolutionary War."
1,Portuguese Import,This is a Portuguese import. Its packaging is in Portuguese and its subtitles are in Spanish and Portuguese. The disc plays in English however.
3,Al's Ok but Nat forgot her lines,"The Film was based on the American Revolution. Of course it was. But I still cannot understand WHY the had to come all the way from the states to King's Lynn in Norfolk to film the main parts of it. The Film went over budget by several $MILLION'S But Hey... I was an extra and for twenty pounds a day or 25 pounds if you got wet it was better than working for a living, Hey they even fed us... Which was nice... I went to see the film when it was released on the big screen in King's Lynn. You could not really watch the film because of all the local people who were also extras shouting ""Look...there's me!"" and other stuff. It is a LONG film with some very excellent actors, actresses and action. When was the last time you saw an epic that wasn't too long and drawn out... It's OKAY, But not that Okay..."
3,Not That Bad,"I am surprised with at the vehemence of the bad reviews for this movie. I will grant you that this is definitely not one the ""The Greats"" but I do think that it is a movie with an interesting spin and viewpoint dispite the fact of some questionable directing and producing. I think that this movie does give the common mans view of the War at least a lot more than any other movie on the subject. I would suggest this movie to anyone interested in history and has an open mind who wants to see the War a little differently."
1,Umm...what?,"The only thing I learned about the Revolution from this stinker was that everyone had a speach impediment (perhaps this was why they were shipped off to the colonies in the first place). If you're one of those incoherent-noisy-continuous-mob-scene, point-the-camera-at-the-least-lit-spot-on-the-set kind of people, this is the film for you."
2,Not Pacino at his best.,"The only redeeming quality of ""Revolution"" is the cinematography. If you a Pacino fan I cannot suggest this movie as it may tarnish your opinion. Let me clarify by saying that he is not horrible, the role just does not fit him."
3,Many Will Enjoy This,"Now I'mma be honest with you: I only saw this decades ago to see Annie Lennox. And even more honestly, her role in it is quite small. Having said that, as much as people love period pieces and war films, then they would be sure to love this. It meets the genre expectations of those films well. If viewers love them some ""Farinelli,"" or ""Schindler's List"" or ""Cold Mountain,"" then they should love this. For those who love gore, remember that amputation was the only medical response to many things in the 1700s. My boss is a Congressman and he said many federal representatives love them anything that has to do with the Civil War. Nowadays, folk get much more excited about that war than the American Revolution. Still, I think many viewers who missed this in the 1980s will enjoy it intensely even two decades later."
2,"Teachers, this is good punishment for your bad students","Instead of making them write hundreds of sentences, why don't you make them sit and watch this video! As good an actor as Al Pacino is, he's totally miscast in this film. We all endured U. S. History class when we were in school, but this movie in practically no way presents life as it was in that period. Despite its length, it presents a poor depiction of the history of the American Revolution. If movies received grades, it would get a D-."
1,different from picture,"What I received was not what is pictured or described. Maybe they ran short before x-mas and substituted a cheaper product but there are no ""extra"" pockets or long pocket as decsribed."
5,Great Dog Lover Documentary!!,"I watched this Documentary years ago when it first came out and was so touched. Anyone involved with shelters or rescues should watch this video. Not only is it inspirational, but it is so informative as to the treatment of dogs that can't, for whatever reason, can not be adopted out. Touching, inspirational and informative. I would recommend this video any any dog lover. I have yet to get tired of it and I have watched it over and over again for a few years."
5,Boxer Lover,"I had seen this documentary playing on HBO and for a long time couldn't bring myself to watch it. I am barely able to go to the shelters now without crying or bringing home another animal. However, one night I decided to give Shelter Dogs a chance and am so glad I did. There were some scenes that really were hard for me to watch but I began to look at things a bit differently than I had before. I had been a supporter of the no-kill policy but after seeing how some of these animals have to live out their lives, I no longer think it is the answer. This film really touched my heart and I would recommend it to anyone who thinks they have already made up their mind on these issues."
3,This woman is an idiot!,"the 3 star rating is because this is a very well made documentary, but it just proves the crazy ideals of some people. during the movie, there was a dob turned over because of a genetic back issue. the poor thing was just 6 months old and homeless because of another case of puppy mills/backyard breeding. ridiculous! THEN this idiot wants to put him down because he might be sad and/or depressed while having a neckbrace on!?!?!? OMFG! thank goodness for the girls that work for her or else that poor dog, that is still living a very happy, healthy life, would be dead because shes a moron.and to put down a dog because its nippy.. you've got to be joking!i have never been so outraged in my life! this woman is as bad as PETA. ugh!"
4,Ok,I reluctantly rented this for my daughter. We watched it and it was interesting to see just how careless people are when it comes to safety. So many of the events seem as though they really could have been avoided. The events were so stupid I half expected it to be a Ripley's Believe It Or Not.
1,The show is poorly done and poorly proofed,I have now seen a couple of these episodes (via spike way back when I had cable) and some of the ways to die were disproved by mythbusters. The one I can think of on the top of my head is the woman who had her breast implants explode in her chest when in an airplane. Mythbusters demonstrated that they would have to have been so high up that she and the rest of the people on the plane would have died from a lack of oxygen for the implants to drastically change their shape... but even at those altitudes the implants never ruptured let alone done it explosively.
5,What A Great Deal!,When I saw the price of this Cuisinart soup pot I thought it was an error! But I think this pot is great and I use it several times a week or more. We like soups and chili and taco filling. This is an excellent non-stick pan that goes from the stove-top to the oven and looks great on the table or my wrought iron shelf. Everyone should have this premium pot in their kitchen!
4,Great resource !,I used the text for a space planning class. It was well organized and there were tables for referencing anthopometric data quickly. I kept it on hand while drawing floor plans for easy reference.
4,Irish moments: a musical journey across the Island,It is an instrumental DVD that is excellent as a melange of music and visualizations of Ireland.
1,This toner cartridge is awful,"I have always been told to use OEM cartridges, but I felt Amazon would check that the product worked ok.I just installed the cartridge and my printer is printing terribly. There are streaks and smudges everywhere. I will ask Amazon for a return authorization as soon as I get a chance.To call this product inferior is really an understatement,"
1,Horrible!!,"The print output is terrible!! Horrible!! Gum-like black ink... sticky and spreads like gum on the paper! What HAPPENED??I have received very good cartridges from this vendor for the Brother printers.I suspect this one is OLD and dated.. perhaps it has a very very old shelf life.I will try something else.., maybe fork over $170 for the pricey OEM HP Q2610A! I guess."
4,Compelling Insight About Christian Sect,"Being from the Appalachians, I have always been fascinated with this sect of Christianity. Weston La Barre's academic prose and insight trace the sect in its relationship to greater society, the culture (through psychoanalysis and comparative symbols), and the individual. The style is interesting and succinct as it traces the origins of the practice in 1909 to the phenomenon in crisis in the 1950's; the writing does not offer insight into contemporary snake-handling traditions and may seem dated. La Barre does not humnaize the practioners as does Covington in Salvation On Sand Mountain, but his insights and parallels to the snake as symbol are stimulating. Referring to the snake-handlers as a cult is problematic for their beleifs, aside from snake-handling and poison drinking, are in allignment with Christianity. Good book to read especially if your are intersted in this phenomenon."
3,Fellow Traveler,The authors bring to light many misconceptions; some that I have a personal acquaintance with while some I have observed. This book has helped me to define clearly some disconcerting false assumptions.The first third or so of the book was down to earth and held my interest but then I seemed to get a feeling that I was reading a manual written by psychiatrists.I believe there is very valuable information in this book but wish the authors could have written more like fellow travellers.JimDynamic Life Enterprises
5,excellent book,"This has been one of the best books that I have read. I recently had a very sad experience with a Pastor and his wife. This book has been a God-send. It has helped see things clearly, and gain my freedom."
3,Some Good Information,"This book gave me some good information, I would recommend it to others for sure."
1,Not a good book unless you're in therapy,"Poorly written book. I was very disapointed. A lot of psycho babble (I should know because I have a degree in psychology). If you're a healthy, balanced person you have no need for this book. But, if you have emotional baggage from the past, you'll probably be thrilled with this book."
4,Great instructional tool about AP Classes!,I use this film to teach parents of middle-schoolers about preparing their children to take Advanced Placement classes in high school. It's a very inspiring and motivational film that never disappoints. I just wish it had a Spanish audio track or in the very least came available with Spanish subtitles!
2,I Payed Little Attention,"""Stand and Deliver"" was pretty boring. I didn't know what to expect from it, but an entire movie about a teacher trying to encourage his students to pass a test until the very end just was not entertaining to me. It was a little entertaining, but not quite enough to really like at all."
2,DOESN'T QUITE DELIVER THE GOODS,"Despite a very strong cast, laudable aspirations and almost universal critical acclaim, ""Stand and Deliver"" is ultimately a noble near-miss. Though based on the real-life classroom success of teacher Jaime Escalante and the Latin-American students whom he led to new heights of academic achievement, the film is badly undercut by a surprising lack of conviction. The classroom scenes are tame and the interaction between Escalante and his supposedly hapless students lifeless. The alleged troubles of his students are painted in such broad strokes that they quickly disappear into the background, making the kids'eventual triumph seem trite and cinematically inevitable rather than inspiring. A tighter script and more imaginative direction would have made this a much better film. As it is, this is more of a light documentary than a movie, and pales next to similar films like ""Lean on Me"" and ""The Blackboard Jungle."""
4,I think Stand and Deliver is a good movie for children.,"I think this movie is good because it has a little action together with only a few cuss words, no sex or nudity, and lots of good dialogue.The movie has a good plot: a teacher teaches students that they can believe in themselves and they do not need to pay attention to disparaging remarks from others."
5,Stand and Delivers Really Delivers!,"In ""Stand and Deliver"" Edward James Olmos, almost unrecognizable, rightly earned an Oscar Nomination for his portrayal of an idealistic teacher in a run-down school. He makes extraordinary efforts to connect and motivate his students. He is a shining example of that cliche term ""No one cares how much you know until the know how much you care."" Olmos's character cares more than any teacher I have ever met myself. Awesomely inspiring!This film is now available with Morgan Freeman's ""Lean on Me"" which is another great film on education. Both films,Stand and Deliver/Lean on Meare worthy of a place in your DVD collection."
4,One of the great feel-good movies,"Edward James Olmos as Jaime Escalante, a high school math teacher in the bario of E. Los Angeles. He decides to teach a class of tough-guy kids calculus, but more, he teaches them self-respect. The message is greatly inspirational and it's hard not to want to jump up and cheer at the end, but for anyone who's ever stood in front of a classroom there are some problems with real-world issues. First off it looks as if Olmos teaches only one class at school - what about his other classes? All the kids are eating out of his hands before long (they are able to keep their home/peer problems separate from school), and everyone succeeds at the end, even after they've all been accused of cheating and take the test again. Like I said, it's a great feel-good movie, and Olmos is excellent as Escalante - just take some of it with a grain of salt."
3,Some good some iffy,"This illustrates very well the good that can be accomplished by one truly dedicated (dedicated to the students) teacher. I appluad this teacher. This movie (Hollywood's take)would lead one to believe that the system, often driven by racial bias is the reason for all these students problems. I do not think so."
3,EXCELLENT MOVIE. DVD NO BETTER THAN VHS VERSION,"This movie is 50 times the movie that Lean On Me is. Stand and Deliver came out while I was in Middle School. I can remember it being shown on PBS. The true story of an ex-Engineer who becomes a high school teacher and encounters the difficulties of the public school system in East Los Angeles. He make the students believe in themselves and aim for something higher through education, resulting in a modern day miracle. This is the story of how all teachers should be. This DVD version is not a remastered version, so the VHS version is just as good."
5,~=\*America's Youth Over Come Once Again*/=~,"Set in Garfield High School, L.A., this movie shows the potential of our youth set in motion with the help of a Bolivian teacher who believes all we need is ""ganas"" - the will power to do something. Based on a true story, Jaime Escalante (James Edward Olmos) over comes great obstacles to prepare his students for the A.P. Calculus exam and the real world they are about to enter. Their first taste of the world comes to them in the form of the E.T.S. as they are accused of cheating. They must now deal with the betrayal of the system they are finally eligible to compete in."
5,Better than I thought!,"Had to watch this movie for a class I was taking- didn't think I'd like the movie that much, but I was surprised. The main actors are great and left me inspired. This movie is based on a true story and shows the power of influence."
5,An Inspiration to Latino Students!,"Stand and Deliver is a movie about how Latino's struggle in the school system to prove that they too are productive and intellectual members in society. As a struggling Latina this movie was inspiration 14 years ago. It gave me the motivation to seek higher education. Today, I am a proud ""Professional Latina!"" Edward James Olmos character as Escalante was outstanding! Edward is a man who I truly admire and respect. He is doing great contribution in the Latino community in Los Angeles with at risk youth today. The character ""Lupe"" in Stand and Deliver is a dear close friend who I also admire and respect. I have the privilege to have her as professional work partner! Overall, I rate this movie a 10!!!"
3,They do Stand,Good movie but it is totally dated. I also am upset to find the group have admitted they cheated during the first exam. They passed around a note with answers and the proctor did not see it taking place. Nevertheless Escalante did change his students and they actually learned the material.
5,Top notch seller!,Product excellent and exactly as described. Speedy delivery. Definitely an A+ seller! Will use again!
5,Arrived in a timely fashion,Sent this to my neice as a gift and she was just tickled pink to have it and watch it! :-) Now her collection is complete!
5,Thanks,"So happy I had something. I could watch during the early hours of the morning at 4 am. Great, thanks again"
4,the saga continuers and this is where the battles begin and the war starts,this is better than the first movie because the saga continues and the action really heats up when the battles begin and the war starts and it seems hopeless when the fellowship is spread apart.
2,Skips every few minutes,"This seemed like a great deal but alas, the discs skip every few minutes when I play them, both in my computer's player and my DVD player. It's worth it to just buy the official DVD that costs around $25."
4,Cool record!,"I picked this up on recommendation from the Hives page. It's really good. It's a pretty rockin record and alot more varied than I expected. The first track's got a great catchy hook going. It fits well among the hives, the white stripes and the strokes thing that's going on, but doesn't really sound like any one of them. There are these really short little instrumentals on it that were cool at first but feel like speed bumps to the full songs after awhile. But that's what the track forward button is for! Overall, it's a good one."
1,Bowls dont stick,"I could not get these bowls to stick to any surface. I tried our table (wood), the counter-top (granite) and his high chair tray (plastic) and even with wetting the bottom, my 1 year old could easily pull the bowl off the table, which defeats the whole purpose of these bowls."
3,"Good, but not perfect . . .","Generally speaking, these are well made bowls. We tried them for the first time yesterday and at first it appeared to be a perfect solution. However, by the end of my son's dinner, he had managed to remove the suction base from his tray and threw it on the floor. Fortunately, he had already eaten his food. If the suction can consistently stay on until the end of the meal, I'll be very satisfied with the product, but my experience tells me that over time suction cups lose their suction. We'll see . . ."
3,Great if you don't use the lids,"The suction cup on the bottom for these bowls is great(only one is included, you have to switch it when you want to use a different bowl). However it is REALLY hard to put the lids on, so I don't recommend using them for anything but feeding."
3,"Bowls are okay, but there are drawbacks...","I just received these bowls - I ordered two sets. I'm actually thinking about returning the set that I haven't opened...! The suction base works about as well as what you'll find anywhere (sticks best on the plastic high chair tray), but as other reviewers have said, the base is difficult to put on to the bottom of the bowls. You really have to tug hard, and then sometimes the threads on the bowl bottom aren't completely covered by the base. Another issue is that once you have the lids snapped on (yes, that's hard to do too), you have an equally hard time pulling them off without the bowl jerking in the opposite direction. That might not be a problem if the contents are solid enough not to spill, but loose food (e.g. Cheerios) or anything a little soupy is likely to go flying.In all fairness, I haven't tested them with food yet. If this review proves to be grossly inaccurate, I will come back and edit it..."
4,great fun for spy kids,"My daughters both loved this addition to their spy kits. Great response time from vendor, quick receipt of item."
4,Fresh Rain,"""Soul of the Sky"" is fresh rain amidst the usual smorgasbord of weather textbooks and technical guides. Exploring the personal side of the weather, ""Soul of the Sky"" is a compilation of well written stories of human interaction with the weather. As a stormchaser myself, I particularly enjoyed ""Only a Storm"", an essay by Robert Henson about life under the moody skies of Tornado Alley."
4,Soulive,"Everybody trounced his previous album Comin From Where Im From but I thought it was a decent offering. This album is more of an improvement over that album and it shows his true potential as an artist. I Used To Love Someone was a great song to start off the album. I Cry and Georgie Parker might sound dated to some people but I love those track because it reminds me of R&B/soul was before it got bastardized. Day Dreamin, Clearly, Love Is So Complicated(which nicely samples Barry White's Midnight Groove) and Exclusively are all highlights. Icing On The Cake is just that. Sunshine Anderson and Dolo Pichino show up on the beautiful Last Night. I never liked Love And War feat Macy Gray and Ol' Keeper is unlistenable. Other than that this album is pretty good and is recommended to any fan of soul music(I refuse to use the term Neo-soul). Standouts: I USED TO LOVE SOMEONE, I CRY, CLEARLY, LAST NIGHT, LOVE IS SO COMPLICATED,ICING ON THE CAKE and EXCLUSIVELY."
4,"anthony hamilton is ""SOUL MAN #1!!""","The ""Soulife"" cd is neo-soul at its best! It is just as good as his first. I hope that more of his ""lost works"" surface and are released . He has the same smooth style and vocal equality of the great Bill Withers. My favorite tracks are - ""I Cry"", ""Clearly"",""Georgie Parker"", ""Icing On The Cake"", & ""I Used To Love Someone"".These are standouts, not only because of his execellent vocals, but also because of the feeling and emotions he put into these tracks.I am already looking 4ward to a third cd from ""THE SOULMAN OF THE21st CENTURY""!"
5,I Love Anthony Hamilton,"""You're the only one for me."" Yes, Anthony has shown me that he isn't merely a one-album wonder. This CD stays in my player!Starting out with the ever so haunting, ""I Used to Love Someone"" to ""Love is So Complicated"" I truly love this collection. The arrangements are interesting enough to elicit a positive response from some hard-core Hip Hop fans. But yet, this is without a doubt ""soul with a capital ""S."""
5,Unreleased masterpiece.,"It is a mystery why this CD was never released until now, but I'm glad it was.Some of the songs on here even outshine material on Comin' From Where I'm From. For example, ""I Used To Love Someone."" This CD is truly an unreleased masterpiece."
1,This Sucks!!!,I am an Anthony Hamilton fan even though the review of this CD does not depict my loyalty. I was very disappointed with this release. I went straight out and bought this without listening to it before I bought it. That was definitely my bad. There is not a song on the CD that I like. I Cry started out OK but then it got on my nerves. Anthony Hamilton is a very talented brother. I know that on his next CD he will give us new material that is worthy of his gift.
2,about a 2.5. if you combined this album with His 2nd,"Album coming where I'm coming from then you would have a serious Good Album.you hear things on here that have moments as did the Coming Album,but balance isn't in place as of yet.Anothony Hamilton hasn't even scratched the Musical Surface as to what he could Become with the right balance of songs,Music&Overall Presentation. I dig His Woodsy vibe.stay tunned. I don't really hear a stand out track on this set,but you hear a Promising Career coming."
4,Simply put...This is some fire.,"Man honestly I thought this CD was a flop album cause I didn't even see a commercial 4 it. Talk about a diamond in the ruff. This is just good music. Somethin I would love 2 hear more often. After a few songs I guarantee u will love it, especially if u liked the first one. It just has a good vibe 2 it and is one of those albums that will b in tha disc changer 4 a while and if u don't have a disc changer it will be in your rotation."
3,I love him anyway...,"This album doesn't come close to the last one, but these songs aren't new either. Some of the song's remind me of another R&B; singer rather than Anthony's gritty, yet smooth soul sound.I love, ""I cry"" and ""Daydream"" is a good summer night's song. ""Georgie Parker"" sounds more like his last album. I like it but it's not my favorite.If you don't have either album I would highly recommend ""Comin' from where I'm from"" I love every single song on that one, and I'm in love with ""Float"". That album will still be great in 20 years.He's one of my favorite artist's, and he'll only get better."
4,I am not surprised...,"I'm not sure that I could be disappointed by Mr. Hamilton. His soulful voice and lyrics always hits the spot. I listen to music to feel it and enjoy it not to analyze the lyrics, melodies, and rhythms. I am well pleased with this cd. If you're a fan of Anthony's you'll more than likely enjoy it too."
3,Early work,"I love this guy. Great voice and great music too. This album is good but not great. These are older cuts and they are much more commercial musically then his album ""Coming from where I'm from"". Interesting lyrics but so so orchestration, his voice is not as mature either. Looking forward to new material."
4,Soulful,"Anthony Hamilton is soulful, no doubt about it. I purchased the cd because I really like his voice... He could be singing the ABC's and I'd be satisfied. He is definately underrated in my opinion, but anyway, the cd is great! I recommend it to all Anthony Hamilton fans!"
4,SOUL-FULL,"This is like a bonus CD from his ""Comin' From Where I'm From"" CD. This cat's voice is just gravy and grits! Love it! ""Georgie Parker"" is a gem. ""I Cry"" takes you back to the doo-wop days. ""I Used to Love Someone"" is real smooth. ""Exclusively"" feels like a collabo with Cee-Lo and Dre 3grand, real eclectic. Even the strange voice of Macy Gray sounds a bit better as she duets wtih him on ""Love And War"" (Imagine that). Think of this as like a thick EP. Get this."
4,Good CD but the previous album was better,"I'm a Anthony Hamilton fan because he sounds so old school and his songs are so original. The CD is really good but it didn't jump out and grab me like his previous album. Don't get me wrong it has me now but initially only a few songs caught my attention. This CD will most definetly grow on you because now I enjoy the entire album. Just to give you an ideal of my taste I like slow, nice baseline, and songs with meaning. You know something like a Maxwell or KEM. You will be happy with the purchase. I hope this review helps you out."
5,Sensa Cloud 8 Ballpoint Pen,"I have used a Sensa pen for many years. My first Sensa, unfortunately, was lost recently so I began my search for a replacement. I love the Sensa gel grip -- it is unlike anything I've used before. The pen simply feels good in the hand. I am an administrative professional and, even in these high-tech times, I still rely on a good ol' pen and paper on a daily basis for much of my work. Subsequently, I am a bit picky about the writing instruments I use. I highly recommend the Sensa pen."
4,This is lavendar not Crimson,The written ad on this said it was crimson but it was not the right color. Pen writes wonderfully and it would be too much trouble to send it back. 4 stars for failure to misleading me as to the color of the pen.
5,Kregs Helper,"I got the Klein 662 4-Inch No.2 Square-Recess Tip Round-Shank Screwdriver, for when I need or have a pocket hole some where I can't fit my screwgun to install my Kreg screws, I use this."
1,Don't buy the Motorola MD71,"I purchased this system 8/05 with two handsets. Within 18 months, the handsets began to behave erratically. First, the ringing would go on after the base phone was picked up. Next, the handset would signal ""out of range"" even when inches away. I tried to reset the system but unplugging it; the two handsets just died.Please save yourself a headache and resist purchasing this utter P.O.S. Shame on Motorola for despoiling their brand in such a cheesy fashion"
3,"New Phones, work fine","It's not all that I thought it would be, butit works great and was really cheap!"
1,display stopped working,"The display on the cordless stopped working after a few months. After contacting Motorola several times, they finally sent a replacement unit. This replacement has now stopped working as well and Motorola is refusing to replace it. Don't buy this unit, spend your money on a better quality product from a different company."
1,motorola md791,Battery hold very little charge (cordless). Lost volume of calling party on cordless phone.
1,Ringer problems with MD7091,"I tried three different phones (same model) from three different vendors (thinking that I was one of the unlucky ones to receive a bad unit) and they all have very similar ringer problems -- Line 1 ringer doesn't work, or the phone doesn't ring at any of the extensions when you are on one of the lines, or it Line 1 rings but line 2 doesn't.I am very disappointed at the quality of this phone. When I called Motorola tech support, they passed the buck to my phone provider saying something about baud rates and that the company needs to adjust it in order for the phone to work reliably. What a bunch of crap from tech support!!! I currently have a Siemens two-line phone that works just fine, so its obviously an engineering issue with the phone.I can't believe a company like Motorola would release such a sub-standard phone to the market. How long have they been in the phone business?"
3,"Beware Motorola, read the reviews first!","I bought this phone based on the the different functions that it offered. It has not been all bad, but after 2 months the cordless stopped holding a charge. Well, these things happen. I figured a quick call to Motorola would solve the problem. Boy, was I wrong. I can't get anywhere with them. So, I have to warn you. My phone barely works now (three months later), and Motorola refuses to make good on it. My advice is to stay away from all Motorola products, and most certainly this one."
2,phone,"1-on a desk, the craddle doesn't hold the receiver that well2- no signal or light to be seen or heard re: messages on answering machine"
1,DOH!!!,"Well, it looks nice, it's small, setup isn't hard, the sound is good, and it has several cute little ringtones. However, this phone has a major design flaw that makes it unusable for me:There is no way to tell the answering system to record silently! Every time it answers a call, it broadcasts both the OGM and the message that the caller leaves, through the speaker! There are volume buttons but they make only a slight adjustment, from loud to medium loud.Sometimes, you might not want other people in the room to hear the messages being left on your phone! Sometimes, you might be sleeping, and don't want to be disturbed.Apparently, this never occured to the Motorola product designers. DOH!!! What a boneheaded mistake. Mine is for sale."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE SYSTEM,"Have had my Motorola system for well over a year now. Many, many complaints:1. the handsets buzz2. battery life is bad - one of the handsets now lasts about 3 minutes3. no headset plug on the base unit, which I have to use often because the handsets are so bad.4. You can't read the display on the base unit unless you stand over it and look straight down.5. If you take the time to assign names to all of your handsets, you lose the names when the power goes out! This happens even if you put batteries in the base unit.6. The headset jack on the handset units is nestled into a soft plastic area. Some headsets also have a soft area on the male piece that plugs in. Two soft areas do not connect well... the headset falls out. I finally found a headset that stays plugged in."
4,Beautifully written,"This is an amazing story of one of the ""odd balls"" in life. I actually laughed and cried as I followed the heroine through her trials of dealing with being different in a mainstream world."
2,Not all that,"I was expecting to be wowed by Breakfast on Pluto, but it just didn't do it for me. I thought that Pussy's character was overblown to the point of triteness. Really, even with all her issues, she was quite the one-note sreechy diva. And the violent, o-the-brutality-of-The Troubles interludes just left me shrugging my shoulders. Overall, the book felt like a patchwork of gimmicks, from the narrative structure to the transvestite prostitutes to the torture scenes to the...well, I could go on. I haven't given up on Patrick McCabe, though; I'm planning on reading ""Butcher Boy"" to find out once and for all whether there is any truth to the McCabe hype."
1,I didn't get to the brilliant part,"I'm sorry, but i couldn't get past the first hundred pages. I must be crazy but I thought this book was boring, and hard to read given the crazy way Paddy talks."
3,Paddy Pussy fan,"I was a bit lost with the book. I had seen the movie and thought Paddy Pussy wonderful. Always a mistake to do it that way round, I guess. The writing did give an inkling of how Pussy's mind works and the disparate chapters helped to reinforce this. I found, though, that this made me, as reader, more detached from any kind of narrative. However it led to a wonderful movie so I should be grateful to Patrick McCabe for that."
5,a grotesque comic/tragedy,". Pussy Brady, the hero, struggles with life in Northern Ireland as a transvestite prostitute. . For all of his scathing remarks, he is vulnerable and the reader will be drawn to read on. He seems caught in a world that overwhelms him. Although he plays the sophisticated sarcastic woman of the world, it is obvious that he is not. It is this gap between how Pussy would like to be seen and how he is that is so compelling. One hopes for better things but knows that they are unlikely to happen for him."
3,New Stuff and Old Stuff,"If you enjoyed King’s ""On Writing,"" you will like this as well. Some of the articles are redundant, simply because King tells the same stories repeatedly, but that is what readers want. There are many more stories though that continue to motivate and teach the aspiring writer. If you want to read 160 pages of King’s thoughts on horror fiction, prior to 1981, you don’t need to buy ""Danse Macabre;"" it’s here. I enjoyed several of the interviews and short stories not found elsewhere. Although most of these articles are published in other works, this serves its purpose, to put everything in one volume."
4,"neat, hard-to-find book","This is a good addition to the Stephen King collection, but probably only for fans. As I would read anything by Stephen King, including grocery lists and completed crossword puzzles, I enjoyed this collections of essays."
3,Neat Tricks,"This book is full of fun tricks,puzzles and patterns you can use to impress your friends with. This was written for some of the early calculators but is still very usable now."
3,Typical budget band CD,"BEST OF THE BIG BANDS Vol. 2 is a typical budget label CD with very few songs, and even fewer that are original recordings. Sound quality's good; source material questionable.PLAYLIST --(3:20) In The Mood - Glenn Miller Orchestra(3:18) Frankie and Johnny - Benny Goodman(3:16) Jumpin' at the Woodside - Count Basie(3:34) Blowin' up a Storm - Woody Herman(1:47) Stompin' at the Savoy - Louis Armstrong (in concert)(3:45) The Nearness of You - Jimmy Dorsey(3:07) La Paloma - Artie Shaw(4:50) Tea for Two - Louis Armstrong (in concert)(2:59) Taking a Chance on Love - Tommy Dorsey(3:38) Stardust - Duke EllingtonTOTAL PLAYING TIME -- 33:34"
3,"Convient, but Chunky","These are TODDLER size, not infant size. I own a toddler, so it's okay for me, but they are still a little chunkier and harder to hold than the ""disposable"" ware we get in the baby aisle at Target and Kroger. I do love the convenient carry case that keeps them together and clean in the diaper bag and can refill it with the more slender, toddler-friendly table ware from home."
4,Great book,This is the real deal with lots of diagrams/pictures and accurate Information. I bought one for me and gave it as a gift
2,Rather suspicious.,"At a first glance this book seems very cool. It's a lot of book for the money. It's tidy, with picturesque schemes, drawings and pictures. However, at a more careful reading, it sounds like a Native American version of the Western zodiac astrology. The wheel is split into four quadrants (the directions), each quadrant is divided into three sectors, thus making 12 ""months"" (aren't there 13 moons in the Native American tradition?). Each sector is symbolized by one stone, one plant, one animal. Everything is geometrically boxed. Everything makes perfect sense. Every page is smudged with a little bit of tribal names, a little bit of tribal cosmology, a little bit of the Kokopelli stuff, a little bit of do-it-yourself ceremonies ... Of course, the Great Spirit is there, as are Mother Hearth and the Thunderbird.Cheesey New Age at its best in my humble opinion."
3,Not my favorite,"Definately the weekest of the bunch, and I'm glad to see that I'm not the only person to think so. Although I didnt hate this book and plan to read on in the series, and also I think this is the book i got most wrapped up in. I found myself frustrated with Elizabeth in this one, she seems so blind and her character is so different from the other books. I hope she goes back to the way she was in the others in the next one."
3,The inner circle,"I purchased this book in the hope of finding information related to ancestry among the Cherokee indian tribe. While much useful information was present, the organization requires much sifting and searching to locate specific data. I think this book could become a great book with a little more data and organization. The general nature of the book does not lend itself to specific solutions."
4,A little gem,"Recently a family member met the author of this book and told me about it. Since my grandmother had been an avid quilter, and my mother to some extent I looked it up and ordered it and was pleasantly surprised with the beautiful illustrations and the art and craft so well described!"
4,Good Hanky Quilt Resource,"Very good resource if you're planning a hanky quilt. Although the pictures and instruction in the book are for wallhangings, the author offers enough practical advice and information that a quilter could easily design a bed sized hanky quilt. The author offers chapters for fabric selection and and border selections and ideas on color too. She also offers a chapter on diagrams to make your own patterns which includes borders and block designs. There are lots of color illustrations that work very well with the text. I've recommended this book to several friends that are interested in making hanky quilts. You'll have to buy this used."
2,not what I wanted,"This is a beautiful book, but it is a handkerchief quilt wall hangings book. I was looking for more pratical advice on how to make a quilt-not a wall hanging- using handkerchiefs so was very disappointed. It was money poorly spent."
1,Never Received,I too order this book and never received. I email customer service and never heard back.
3,Tony Rice Guitar Method,"This DVD contained some good commentaries and some great guitar playing.But It is not a good teaching device. More of a listening experience.Sorry, Tony !"
5,"LOVE THE LOOKS, LOVE THE WORK OF THIS STOCKPOT","I came from a large family and just about all of us love to cook. I buy things I like to look at and enjoy working with. I am partial to Cuisinart. It isn't as expensive as some top-of-the-line cookware but it looks fantastic, it is well made and everything cooks evenly at relatively low temperatures. I use this particular stockpot for a wide variety of recipes. The Cuisinart 9 qt. stainless steel stockpot is excellent for browning meat and vegetables for stews or soups or marinating food. All of the normal uses and even unusual dishes like cerviche. It is great for sterilizing jelly jars and waterbath canning. I place a round s/s wire rack in the stockpot to keep my jars off the bottom. I dislike cooking in aluminum. I feel safe with stainless steel and it cleans easily and still shines on my baker's shelf. Stainless steel lasts forever too!"
1,Not worth the price,"While setting this item up, one screw stripped the soft wood of the keyboard drawer and another screw for the height adjustment got stuck and we had to break the screw to remove it just so that we could adjust the height.We decided not to install this under the desk as you'd have to adjust the height properly before screwing it into the wood desktop."
1,not recommended,"the delivery, by the very accomplished perfect company but I comment, buy 1 Pedi, Quick Salon Pedicure Kit (New) and was really excited to see the package, but when I opened the package .... guaoo that disappointment, for looks like a toy = '(I'll give a gift to my daughter, (or so ... not recommended)"
3,useful but fall apart,"I have had 4 of these in the last 6 years. I develop painful callouses from running (feels like arock in my shoe) and periodicall I have to ""sand"" them down. This item works GREAT. It is cheap and falls apart eventually BUT I have been unable to find anything else as useful."
2,not enough power,This doesn't have enough power to do much. Will bogg down when you try to use it on your foot.
2,There Are Better And Cheaper Products like This,Kind of rickety and not much power. There's something called I think Soft N' Smooth out there I liked much better and I think was cheaper. Save your money on this one.
1,DON'T DO IT!,"Hate it...Weak product...It practically stops when you touch your skim...it finished the battery too fast as well...I thought it was one be plugged into the wall, but it uses battery...by mistake Amazon sent 2 of this product when I only asked for 1 as well..so now I have 2 junks...Just buy one you can plug into the wall..you will not get the ability of going anywhere, but at least you gonna get a good torque!"
5,Happy Feet,"I am very pleased with this product. I have one like it and thought I had broken it. I was looking everywhere for a replacement, as this one uses 4 batteries, and has much better speed and works so much better than the Pedi with 2 batteries. Those aren't worth taking home. I feel the price was definitely comparable to the product. I highly recommend it and my feet are very happy and look pretty darn good!!!!"
1,Not worth a dime!,"This thing is worthless! I don't have terrible feet by any means, but the tougher grit disc was worthless. The little motor doesn't have the capability to do a very good job. It was cheap, and I got what I paid for. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Waste of money - no power,The rotary wheel stops completely when I touch it to my skin. This product does not work and was a total waste of money. I am very disappointed.
5,pedicure kit,I have been having my feet attended to by a podiatrist and decided I'd like to have a small piece of equipment that works like the podiatrist has. Was sent to find item at hardware store.......their small drill/sanders were a bit too scary for me to try so went to the internet and look what I found on Amazon! A Pedicure KIt! It works just great and cost a lot less than the item in the hardware store. Easy to use.....(just put in the batteries). Easy to change heads... Replacement pads are available.
4,Overpriced,"This is the same one they sell for a lot cheaper in other Amazon listings. It works ok, but it takes a while because if you push to hard it slows down. If you have patience your feet come out looking pretty when your done."
5,"Man, are my feet smooth now",I have used this product so much that I had to replace my old one. I get really thick calluses and this little beauty takes care of them.
4,Great product!,"I love this product! Does a great job a keeping my heels smooth as long as I use it every other day. Before this product my heels were very dry and cracking. It works like a sander to get rid of the dry skin. My only negitive response is its power. It is a bit cheap, needs more power."
3,NOT ELECTRIC,"The description of this item says it's electric. When I bought it, only batteries could be used and not electric. So I returned it because of this reason only. It should have been electric."
2,Big disappointment,Does not do a very good job on my feet. Just loosens dry skin but does not take it off. Would not recommend it to anyone.
1,my wife says its not good .,man what a waist this one is not even worth ten dollars keep your money in your wallets tell all.
4,smooths rough skin,"Pedi,Quick Salon Pedicure KitMy old one wore out after several years. They work great for smoothing rough heels."
2,Cheap Plastic,The machine is weak. It feels cheaply made. It buffs my callus but does not get rid of it. I talked to a pharmacist and he said to use lotion and gauze pads to soften callus before use. Will try that method.
5,Pedi Quick Salon Kit,This was the fastest easiest dead skin and callous remover i have ever seen. I t was easy and safe to use. I would recommend it to any one looking for a fast and easy pedicure.
4,Noir street level goodness!!,"This is a real gritty street level book that seems more real than most comics set in the normal DC Universe. Although Catowman is the main character, the East End is maybe the true main character. It has a soul all its own. Added to that is the remarkably fun Holly and old school cool Slam Bradley. Throw in a little sexual tension with Batman and you have a really good book. The art, mostly by Brad Rader was pitch perfect for this noir book. A very good read!"
5,Catwoman comes into her own,"The problem with this book is trying to figure out which artist does the best Catwoman. The trouble is that Brad Raider, Eric Shanower, Michael Avon Oeming and Paul Pope (!) are all so masterful that I couldn't come to a resolution. What a great problem to have! Catwoman has come a long way since the T & A ghetto she was stuck in throughout the 90s. Now she's strong, practical, smart and even more sexy.And the story! Ed Brubaker is on his game as usual. Great art, great story. Selina is wonderfully fleshed out and her supporting cast (Holly, Slam Bradley) really shine here.If you love Batman, Catwoman or are a fan of good comics, you'll love this book."
3,GUMMY ENVELOPES,"The envelopes are very GOOD quality; however, most of the seals are already sealed and I am having to carefully pry them open and using monoadhesive to reseal."
4,A good comprehensive classroom text....and more,"This book's best feature is its anthology of choral music designed for classroom use. Rehearsal outlines, problematic passages, and rehearsal technique are all discussed. Another particularly valuable feature is the appendix of lists of repertoire by voicing and genre. Quite extensive. After using it in a class, I find myself coming back to it constantly for reference. The spiral binding is convenient."
4,Beautiful skillet now resides in my kitchen...,"I ordered this skillet when my old non-stick was on it's last legs. When I received the skillet, I loved how great looking it is. The weight of the skillet is impressive. The one thing I've noticed is that the heat distribution is so good, I'm having to reduce the temperature on my stove. What I had to cook at medium high for my old non-stick, medium heat is more than sufficient for the Cuisinart. Cleanup has been easy, though I've had to soak (following instructions from the manufacturer) tougher stains off. The depth of the pan is also fantastic, you can really cook a good volume of food in this pan.Overall, I love the looks, love how it cooks, only wish there were a companion lid for this fine skillet."
5,Kids love this book!,"Whether you know that boxers are indeed ""magnetic"" or not, you'll love this book. I have given the book to several of my ""boxer friends"" and share it with my kindergartners. They enjoy the book, with the antics of this loveable dog!"
5,Great Book,"What a cute book. My daughter loves to make the same faces as the dog does. She has read this book every day since she received it from the tooth fairy, and just cant get enough of it. Any dog lover would really like this cute book!"
3,It's okay,Got this for my 11 year old and it's okay. Thought it could have a little more updated backgrounds with the old cars.
5,Manly and Calming at the same time.,I use both color pencil and markers to color the pages of this book. It is very calming and manly at the same time. Highly recommended.
5,Muscle Cars,"My daughters' favorite of all to customize with body additions and vibrant colors, she enjoys these true to form drawings, just wishes that there were different views of the same cars available"
3,"Some good points, but overall fair","I really liked the title track and still do. It's catchy and well-written. Unfortunately, it's a bit of a misnomer as the rest of the album isn't as strong. There are some nice points, but it's definitely sporadic. His lyrics are simplistic at times, which is fine, but sometimes I want a bit more. Also a bit more country pop than I had anticipated after hearing the title track."
3,Shows Promise.,"If you enjoy good folk music you will enjoy this CD. There are some gems on the the disc, most notably the first 4 songs, then it tapers off a bit toward the end. It interested me enought to purchase his first record and I am eagerly awaiting it. This young man could have a bright future with his intriguing voice and thoguhtful songs.My rating should actually be 3.5 stars but I cannot go by halves, I also think that is a realistic rating. Why is it that everyone seems to give 5 star ratings to things they like? To me, a 5 star rating means the product is absolutely unbelievable, only your absolute favorite items should get that rating. It is much more realistic to rate something you like with 3 or 4 stars. Just a thought."
5,A pleasant CD,I remember Jackie Gleasons music from the time I was a little girl. It was always classy & I loved it.
2,"Dad, can we get another heater?",I bought his thing to add supplemental heat to an 18' x 12' playroom in the basement and frankly my dog could heat the room faster. The only setting we ever use is 7 (highest) and it just doesn't cut it.
3,Not quiet,"The heater works very well at heating up the entire room without any fan - all through convection. And it is quiet for the most part. At night the metal expand and contracts while heating up and cooling down, thereby making loud clacking noises every few seconds. We expected a completely quiet heater, so we are disappointed. It has not been loud enough to wake us up at night, but once we are awake it is hard to go back to sleep hearing the clacking."
1,Great at first... horrible after use,"I bought this heater and a Slant/Fin humidifier... mostly because i read really good things about the companies dedication to quality.... well, I either have the worst luck in the world, or that quality is just a myth. The heater worked ok at first... takes a while to heat up a large room, but its completely silent and there are no odors. However, every now and then, the overheat alarm would go off (and its a very ANNOYING an loud alarm). Besides having to rush to the heater to find it in perfect operating condition and still having to shut it down, it was necessary to leave it off until it completely cooled off, in order to restart it in the same spot... and then everything would be ok. The alarm now goes off almost after an hour and does not stop. It would cost me more to send the heater to Slant/Fin than to buy a new one. Very similar problem with their humidifier.I know one thing, and that is that I am avoiding Slant/Fin products from now on."
5,Soundless and effective,I have two of these heaters and they are wonderful. Two because I have one at either end of a 50 foot long basement rec room (by 20 feet wide)! They warm this room beautifully. The only thing is that they are so completely silent that at first I wasn't sure they were working -- until I started feeling toasty warm...Recommended.
3,Just a handbook,"No need to review this, it just a manual for maintenance and repairs, some of doesn't apply in the real world outside the UK"
2,Cheap Quality,The material is very very thin. The hat does not have ventilation and therefore traps heat. I saw a similar hat at a flee market (in a size medium) for $3.
5,Intriguing story of a remarkable life,"The stories and trials of the young man who would be Pope were remarkable. I could not put it down. Read the book in a day and re-read most of it the following day. It was wonderful to understand why John Paul II was so darn passionate about human rights and the unborn. Unfortuately, our modern school curricula do not spend nearly enough time on the hardships endured under Communism and Nazism. This book will give you a first hand insight into how both political systems tormented young Karol for caring about his country and the Jewish people."
1,A mere 24 pages of large print and lots of blanks,"Not worth the money.BTW, this is an introduction on writing an outline from a topic in your head, not outlining an age appropriate short essay. No way my son is going to do this without learning to go the other way first.(also, I am forced into reviewing this as a toy, not sure why --- it is a booklet, not a toy)"
2,iffy at best,"I was a little disappointed in the book, as a resident of the Tampa Bay area I am very familar with the Roger's family - their pictures were plastered on billboards all over the area, serving as a reminder as to what can happen in paradise.I was hoping that the book would add something I did not know about the case, it didn't - and the writing was not that good.If you are really interested in this story, the BEST thing to read is a series written by Thomas French at The St Pete Times, it is incredibly eloquent, and beautifully written. Mt French won the Pulitzer for the story .. the title is Angels and Demons."
4,"GOOD BOOK , HORRIBLE CRIME","This book takes you through Oba Chandler's life of a hard childhood, and his evil adulthood. His daddy had lived and died hard, and Oba was a rotten kid who used and discarded females later in life. HOW on earth did he find so many stupid women who didn't see past his lines and BS?? Don't talk to strangers is a good rule of thumb, ladies. Maybe the air wasn't fresh enough where they came from. Men like Oba Chandler are simply vultures parading around in human flesh, waiting for their prey. He played the role of Nice Guy, inviting unsuspecting vacationing women onto his boat, and the prey was winging towards his net! What he did to those poor Rogers women makes me absolutely SICK. This book makes you want to see all rapists stripped, slammed in the genitals and up the keyster with more pain and fear than they can bear. Death would be too good for Oba Chandler. The book is well written and I suggest it to anyone who can read it."
4,Story Of A Sadistic Murderer,"You don't want to believe that people like Oba Chandler walk the earth. The guy had no conscience. He really fits the term ""scumbag."" I find it so hard to understand why a woman who couldn't swim, and her two daughters who were uneasy swimmers themselves, would accept an ocean boat ride from a man they had just met. The mother wouldn't even let the girls go in the water on the beach! Obviously, they had no idea how vulnerable they would be on a boat surrounded by water. If the Death Penalty was made for one person, its Oba Chandler. He should die the way his victims did. They ought to go out on the ocean, tie and gag him, molest him, and then throw him overboard with a 40 lb. cement block tied to his neck. And as they are tossing him they should say, ""Swim for it."""
5,Great pan!,"Was looking for several things: a good lasting alternative to nonstick, useful on my glasstop stove, no long handles to arrange in the dishwasher (or store in the cabinet,) able to broil in the oven without worry (and go straight to table,) and a comfortable size to saute, braise or stirfry for my small family. This pan has become my favorite. I was afraid it might be too shallow, but the angle of the sides is just right. Egg frying goes better than expected, and I might just try that Potatoes Anna recipe! Heat conduction is fast and even--have to keep the heat down--medium high at the most. Those little handles don't seem to get hot on top of the stove. I'm thinking of getting the 2 quart one as well for the deeper sides. Great prices, too!"
4,Great!,I am a beginner when it comes to working out. Joy's workout is easy to follow and fun. She gives tips to make it easier or harder. It is divided into two segments so you can do both or just one.
4,"Almost perfect,except on a couple of songs:the best folkprog","This album marks a further step beyond, in comparison to their debut album: this issue in fact shows the maturity of the band, even though you can note a certain ""high tension"" between Francis Monkman and Darryl Way, a couple of remarkable songwriters...on side one you find all the compositions written by the keyboardplayer Way, while within the second side you can appreciate such Monkman's songwriting!! My favourite song is ""Young mother"", a superb track, where the moog effect is used flawlessly ...while ""Piece of mind"" is an evergreen within the 70's progressive world and a true must-have classic as well!!The only weak episode is represented by the track ""Bright Summer's Day '68"" and moreover the biggest hit ""Back street Luv"" to me can not stand in the same place as for instance the suoperb ""Piece of mind"", but definitively this album is well worth checking out!!"
3,Let the sunshine in,"This is probably Curved Air's best-known album. It features the band's one and only hit single ""Backstreet luv"" (peaking at #4 in the UK charts in 1971) and its b-side ""Everdance"". ""Backstreet luv"" indeed is the best song of an album that has nothing particularly interesting to offer. ""Young mother"" and ""Piece of mind"" (10 mins.) are o.k., but as the reviewer below said, the rest is lightweight. Curved Air's concept of connecting classical music with atmospheric rock seems to be interesting, but unfortunately their music often doesn't keep what their futuristic cover artworks promise. Sonja Kristina's girlish voice and the flat-sounding music let Curved Air's sound rarely get more than ankle deep. Great wasted talent! Their best album is their more rock-oriented debut ""Air Conditioning"", along with the live cut ""Live at the BBC""."
2,Bottom disc popped off,"I loved this pot until I was cooking a recipe from Saveur for Vietnamese ribs. The recipe instructed me to quickly remove the pan from the heat and plunge it into ice water. I did this and the bottom copper disc popped most of the way off. A flaw in the recipe or a flaw in the pan, or a combination of both? I don't know, but I am out one expensive stock pot and can't get it replaced!"
3,Mine is unreliable,"This starter is definietely new. It is quick and powerful. However, the one I got has a problem. The ""drive"" assembly that throws the gear into the flywheel to engage and turn the engine sometimes hangs up and the starter is already spinning fast by the time it hits the stationary ring gear, resulting in a grind situation. I will be sending this one back for an exchange before my ring gear gets mangled.Later note: I waited too long and am not allowed to return this thing. It is definitely faulty and headed for the trash can."
3,Good Read but...,"Overall this book is a good read but compared to many of T. Davis Bunn's other books, this one came up short. There was very little spiritual dimension to the characters and I found myself several times having to go back to figure out what was happening. The legal jargon had me lost. I'm glad I read it but I won't keep my copy or share it with friends."
2,I do not recommend the Audiobook version,"This review pertains to the abridged Audiobook version of this novel. I listened to it recently and found it rushed, the plot hard to follow, and missing depth. I didn't really understand the characters and their relationships, and found myself lacking emotional involvement in the climactic scene involving Marcus and Kirsten. Reading the rest of these reviews, I realized that most of what readers have commented about (the courtroom drama, the relationship between Kirsten and Marcus, the parallel between the pasts of Kirsten and Erin) was taken out in the abridged audio version. And the audiobook really gives no indication of why this would be called Christian Fiction at all. These seem to be essential parts that would have made the book much more enjoyable- so, I recommend that you read the book (which sounds good, now that I read more about it) rather than listening to the abridged audiobook!"
1,NOT TOO PLEASED,This is my first book that I've read. I felt Davis was just too overly descriptive and found this book too boring. I felt that I kept missing something and had to ready the same thing over again. I hope his other books aren't like this.
2,Not much noir here,"I guess the editors decided that noir sells, the problem is there's not much noir here. Of the 30 some odd stories in this book, maybe a third of them could be considered noir. I guess the editors expanded the definition to any crime story. There are some good stories here, particularly by Carroll John Daly, Mickey Spillane, David Goodis, Max Allan Collins and Norbert Davis, but there's also a lot of mediocre stuff (most of the stories in the second half of the book range from fair to awful). Even terrific writers like Lawrence Block are represented by pretty bad stories (and as bad a Block's story is it's not even remotely noirish). I don't know, I have to think that if Spillane and Collins took this book more seriously they could have come up with a better representation of noir fiction. Even a noir master like James M. Cain is represented by a mediocre story that doesn't even classify as noir."
3,Nice read.,"This was a nice, easy read. Finished the book in one day. Story somewhat jumped around. Transitions not smooth. I would recommend for a quick, entertaining read."
3,Good Plot,"While I enjoyed the story-line, I had difficulty reading between the numerous typos. This book could benefit from a better editor."
5,THRILLING READ!,"I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. THE AUTHOR DESERVES TWO THUMBS UP FOR THIS ONE! FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THE CHARACTERS SEEMED SO AUTHENTIC AND REAL. EVEN THE MAIN CHARACTER,SHANICE, WHO LATER BECOMES VIOLENT IS EASY TO LIKE. THE WAY THE AUTHOR WRITES THAT PART IS SO ORIGINAL. UNLIKE THE USUAL HARSH, DESPICABLE DEPICTIONS OF ABUSERS, DENISE CHOOSES AN ORIGINAL APPROACH. FIRST SHE MAKES YUOU FALL IN LOVE WITH SHANICE THE SAME WAY JADA DOES, THEN SHE SHOWS YOU THE OTHER SIDE OF SHANICE. BY THE END OF THE BOOK I UNDERSTOOD WHY IT'S SO HARD FOR JADA OR ANYONE IN AN ABUSIVE SITUATION."
1,a total waste of money,"The synopsis given sounds engaging, but I quickly lost interest with the many typos and the way it was written. Come on! You're a writer! Don't be so cavalier with the grammar rules!! Please! I'm not sure if the book was good or not because the style of writing quicly got on my nerves so much so that I'm returning it for a refund having only read the first 5 pages. If you're looking for a good read, this isn't it."
3,Decent,"To short, to fast paced and not that great. Good for a few hours worth of reading on a Saturday afternoon."
4,Short and Sweet.....,"This is a straight to the point read. Throughout the book the author brings out thoughts of most females when it come to the trivial sayings of being ""stictly dickly.""Jada has this tantilizing and luscious girlfriend Shanice. Shanice has a broken past and tries to walk forward with Jada. Jada tries and helps Shanice with her hard times but starts to crumble with frustration. Can Shanice overcome her past? or Can Jada deal with the way Shanice has become?A quick good read and reccomended to past time with this interesting story."
3,"A Beginning, But No More","This is another book in the Frank Fabozzi vein, being a compendium of articles written by practitioners in the field and loosely strung together by the editors. As a very basic introduction, it is not bad - there are discussions of the rationale for using credit derivatives, a cursory introduction to pricing and modelling, and very general discussions of issues relating to accounting, documentation, taxes, etc. The best chapter is ""Credit Derivatives Pricing Dictionary,"" by Hardy M. Hodges, which provides definitions of some of the most important concepts and would stand quite well on its own. However, if you expect something more than generalities, you will be disappointed. There is very little by way of practical advice on structuring, modelling or other ""nuts and bolt' issues. This book will teach you enough to get past the HR department, but if you want to get on the trading desk you had better look elsewhere!"
1,A mishmash of contributed work. When will they learn?,"This is another frustrating book with chapters submitted by various contributers. It's difficult to follow any cohesive logic to this book. Call this a Bible if you consider multiple authors a criterion, but as an information storehouse, this book is no better than reading a series of disconnected magazine articles."
4,"Fun, funny, obscuro stuff","-------------------------------------------Various Artists""Velvet Tinmine""(RPM Records, 2003)-------------------------------------------This is a noteworthy collection of UK glam rock rarities - some tracks are ephemeral, while a few are a real gas. Occasionally the musicianship and energy rises to the same level as glam gods such as Marc Bolan or Slade, and novelty numbers such as ""I Wanna Go To A Disco"" (sung by the adolescent Ricky Wilde) or Tartan Horde's ""Bay City Rollers We Love You"" are true '70s gems. This collection is the result of some serious cratedigging by dedicated, crazy collectors and it pays off. It's not all gold, but it sure is shiny. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue music reviews)"
3,"The book ACTUALLY was titled ""Women""... way back when.","This is really just a response to the two other reviewers who are going back and forth about the title. The book ""white woman"" was actually printed back in 1978 and was titled ""women""... not sure how it picked up the ""white"" label... or when or why... maybe I'll research that... but jsut so you know... the first printing of it was titled ""women"""
4,The Only Way To Live,"I don't think we as human beings actually recognize the power of daily reading, meditation, and reflecting. Practicing these powerful principles allows us to remain mindful of the moment and reflect upon the deeper question in our lives. To devote ourself to a daily meditation and to journal on these quiet times is priceless and will certainly aid in the evolution of our soul. For me this practice has allowed an awakening to take place and opens my life up to all the opportunities that are available in this universe. Please give this practice a try! This book will help you in your journey of living and cultivating an active consciousness in your daily life.Richard A. Singer Jr. Author Your Daily Walk with the Great Minds of the Past and Present."
3,Little Changes in Detail,Switched from VGA to this DVI and I notice small detail from graphics that popped out at me on a few sites. As for my videos I see minimal changes in quality except for a few videos which seem to be more vivid. Streaming quality is the same as my videos.Cons:Product was covered in some sticky residue.Troubles:The connections were sort of a tight fit on both my monitor and PC.Pros:Wife can see more change than I can.It was cheap.Shipped in the given time.
4,Nice and cheap,"Giving this four instead of 5 for two reasons:1) The cables came labeled as HDMI instead of DVI on the packaging, which I don't understand.2) I had to shave off a quarter inch of plastic off both of the cables so I could plug them both into my graphics card.Besides that, they work great, and I'm happy with the purchase. The cables are nice and thick, and don't feel nearly as cheap as I expected."
1,Wasted money,"Item came in timely manner, however, cable was heat/shrink wrapped in MFG, which melted and fused the cable, exposed the interior wiring, screw cap for terminal connection defective as well which rendered it useless. Manufacturing/packing defect, not vendor's fault. Minimal investment however. Live and learn."
1,doesnt work for mac mini-dvi to dvi adaptor,"Doesnt really work for my setup from macbook pro via mac/dvi to dvi adaptor to nec 1760nx monitor. dont know if its the adaptor, dvi-to-dvi eforce cable or the graphics card itself.basically screen flickers blue or ultimately reverts back to only the macbook screen.disappointing."
5,Good cable,"When I purchased this cable, one of the pins was almost melted. It wouldn't screw into the monitor or computer. I contacted the seller, and they sent me a new cable free of charge. The second works perfect. Nice to have a larger screen."
2,Its not a dual link dvi cable.,My 2560x1600 monitor doesn't work with this cable. It can only go up to 1280x800 with this cable.I tried it with another one and it worked just fine at 2560x1600. If you have a single link monitor it will work fine at any other resolution.
1,Shoddy made cable.,"I purchased this brand new dual-link DVI cable that had a bunch of specs about how much data it could transfer. When I plugged it into my Dell 30"" monitor which runs at 2650 x 1600 resolution it looked horrible. Everything was blurry and monitor was reporting some weird off resolution. I went to the store and spent a little more on a better cable and it works great. I did some research and it people have been having problems with poorly made Chinese or foreign cables that cannot handle the high resolution. Might work for a standard monitor 1080p but nothing higher."
1,Doesn't support 2560x1440,"I tried two of these cables on three different computers and was not able to get them to support 2560x1440 resolution. They maxed out at a half horizontal resolution of 1280, so we were able to do 1280x1440, but that was unacceptable."
2,NOT DUAL LINK !!!,"I checked the center pins with ohm meter, its not dual link.The hold down screws were not locked into the finger caps thus could not tighten them. I had to glue screw to cap.It does work with my new LG 2742 pc monitor and the picture is good.Dual link is not needed in my setup, my moniter does show 1080p, so it worksThe ends do fit well with both the video card and moniter, the 6ft cable is very soft and easy to bend.I would not buy this one again if I needed another. This was a big disappointment in many ways, lucky its cheap and not a big deal, it would cost more to get a replacement and it could be worse.I do not recommend buying this one"
1,Didn't Work,"As a basic cable, and probably the simplest device involved in my new computer build, I really expected it to just work without question. Process: Assemble tons of computer components, plug in monitor, turn on new computer...nothing on screen! Oh no! Attempt to retain stomach contents, take a few minutes to just remain calm...think and think. Turns out my monitor came with it's own chord (which it didn't advertise as doing in it's product description which is why I ordered this in the first place). Might as well just try the other chord just case on the off chance that I got a faulty chord. Lo and behold, my screen suddenly works and all is well is the world of pc building again. Not worth my time to try and get a refund or return product. Maybe I was just the unlucky schlub who got the one bad cable...I can't say. All I know is this cable owes me dinner after what it put me through."
4,DVI cable,received thr cable and installed it rIght away. It is doing a fine joB.Good service from the vendor
2,Glitchy?,"I think this cable has some problems - it ""works"" in that when I connect it from my laptop to my monitor I do get an appropriate image etc. but there is also some little ""fuzzy"" spots that come and go in parts of the screen. When I use a VGA cable to connect I get none of these so I'm thinking it is this DVI cable causing it. It was very cheap compared to other DVI cables so that may be why (?)"
5,Eforcity 6Ft DVI cable,The delivery was fast and the cable came just as it was decribed. A good quality cable at a great price. It hooked up to my flat screen monitor and is working fine.
2,Just didn't work,"I wanted to write a good review on this cable, as I'm a champion of low priced cables and do not believe in all the hoopla over expensive cables (as in most situations, most electrical engineers will tell you that wire is wire), but this cable just simply did not work for me. I needed it to connect my computer to my Dell monitor that is capable of 2560x1600, but the cable seemed to operate in single link mode. It had all the right pins on both sides, but just didn't work. Replacing the cable with one I bought from a local store (at 4 times the price) worked.I believe it was just my luck that I got a bad cable."
5,The cable is just what i needed,"works as described. Just what i needed and the price was great. I use it with viewsonic 22"" - no issues. Thanks!"
1,Artifacting and Screen Flicker,"Pros: NoneCons: Extremely low quality (as others have mentioned) causes pixel artifacting and continuous screen flicker. I tested this on two screens and with two Mini DisplayPort-to-DVI adapters and obtained the same results for both.Other Thoughts: I ended up spending $28 at a local retailer for a cable that works perfectly and gives me the high-quality 1080p signal from my HD5870 that I expected in the first place. I wish I had read the other reviews before ordering this product, and gone with a quality cable the first time around."
5,Best DVI cable for the money,Works perfectly at 1080p. Best quality picture than standard VGA cable. You will not find a better deal on a DVI cable.
5,Good cable,"Good cable. Took a lot of careful comparison to see the improvement over analog cable. I am using a 22"" 1680 x 1050 monitor and thought digital connection will give me better video. Not quite so."
5,Works as a cable should,"Not much to say about a cable. It either works or doesn't, and this one works perfectly. Plus, good price."
5,Good quality cable,"Good quality cable - especially coonsidering the price. Used to connect between a DVI-D video board and Samsung HDTV monitor at 1920x1080. Works perfect & allows switching between VGA, DVI-D and HDTV."
3,Lets party!!!,"Saw it many years ago and have never been able to locate it. Lots of beer, babes, and a great party atmosphere...better than any of the spring break movies of the past!"
2,No Navigator,"I really love the sounds of AK 1200. Maybe he should have just done this alone and it would have been better off. MC Navigator (in all the live shows with him and AK) drowns out all the musical quality of each track. For instance, ""Drowning"", one of the best tracks in AK's set is just full of giberish vocals by Navigator. What a waste of a good song. Anyways, dont buy this if it has your favorite AK 1200 song on it, save your money for one of his studio CD's."
1,This album is weak,"This album is weak. It is hardly worh listening to; the disruptive rantings from Navigator make me cringe. There is no rhythm or continuity within his MCing efforts. He must have been exhausted from the tour, and probably stayed up too late the night before or something. There are no, I repeat no MCing skills made manifest in his holloring nonsense. Navigator is never on time, and always spoils the tracks by forcing his voice over the track with no respect to the intended rhythm of the music. Besides the bad MCing, the reproduction audio quaility is poor, I suspect because they had to give Navigator plenty of barking volume on his mic. It can be done right and sound well, sure, but it wasn't done so here. Other than that the mix by Ak is pretty good. Don't buy this album if you have any sense in what an MC-aided drum and bass set should sound like......"
2,"ak1200, what happened?","I admit that on cd's mc's are usually a bad idea, but sometimes it works out. This is not one of those times. I have heard Navigator before, and he is actually pretty good. But on this cd he says the same things over and over! ""Where you at San Francisco"" ""Louder"", all of these mantras are burned into my brain! Have some originality man! If you want to hear some good mc work that actually compliments the music (which is really good too!), pick up Hive's ""hip hop 2023"" cd. Anyway, if the music was good it still could have saved this cd. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't anything new. I know ak1200 can do better than this. The only reason that I still own this cd is because of the Cleveland Lounge song ""drowning"" at the end. I have always loved that song, and this version is a little different than the one on his previous alblum."
1,not even worth the plastic it was imprinted on,i can't believe that i bought this cd. jesus christ this mix sux more than a crack ho's mother on the 1st of the month when rent is due. thanx ak... for making me wanna puke. forget navigator's appalling US debut in recorded format... even the track selection highlights the postboredom that the jungle scene fell into after 2000. i recommend dieselboy's 6th session and dj db's higher education for a much more profound understanding of how the junglist held it down after 2000 byatch.
2,quality ak; one mc less please,"Moonshine's a top-notch label and Ak1200's past releases have been excellent. But anyway mixed live. With Mc ""All I can say is 'San Francisco', 'Make some noise'and 'Wicked selecta'"". Okay a little harsh, but navigator's GPS was broken at this show. he had very little flow and absolutely nothing to say except the fore mentioned things. Usually an Mc will at least hold his ground or really add to the mix but navigator was just stale and annoying. The album would have actually been better without him in my opinion.Other than the Mc, AK1200 brought the goods. the track selection was very solid and his mixing skills made the mix better than other jungle mixes. he ends the mix with his beloved 'drowning' by cleveland lounge. it's a dope track and it's nice to hear his remix of the song.Pick up Lock and roll.it's a 5 star. Checkout XXXL and Mc skibadee's releases 'Blowing cones and domes'and' 2001:drum and bass odyssey' for some good jungle with a quality mc."
4,Put Your Hand Together for AK1200!,"One of the most successful electronic music tours can be expected to bring the best electronic music acts. AK1200 has become one of the biggest names in the Drum and Bass genre, and this live cut from his San Francisco appearance proves why. A combination of AK1200's brilliant turntable stylings, MC Navigators crowd pumping freestyle, and the energy felt by the crowd who were listening to it live make this CD a must in any electronic music fan's collection. You do not know Drum and Bass until you have heard a live act with an MC calling to you. Mixed Live with AK1200 and MC Navigator will take you there, right by the speaker."
5,good product,This works great on fabrics. The couch and the carpet needed a good dose. I still have plenty to do the recliner.
4,Informative and insightful,"I found the book to be extremely enlightening. Really getting into the process and the approach of the firm was awesome. Not the most eye catching book but for content, it was phenomenal. Preaching concept, communication and being open-minded, the book really reinforces those strong ideas in graphic design. It's definitely not for everyone, but I strongly recommend it to designers who strive to do great work that has a purpose and communicates."
1,Pretentious Waste of Paper,"...If you want inspiration get DesignAgent or SoakWaskRinseSpin. I'm not sure what these guys were thinking. It has twelve pages of code, about 30 pages of one word written in different colors. There is hardly any real design. Just a waste of paper. It's not even artsy in a good way. Sorry to be so harsh. But it's not even a good coffee table book."
2,Collage material,"By itself, this book has no soul, but it's worth buying to appropriate from.Perhaps the point of the book is that the firm works best in tandem with the client; without a client, there is no dynamism.But, for the beauty of the images, the quality of its printing, its many papers and series, the book should be cut up, glued together and offered as the collaboration Cahan etc. thrive on."
2,Promotional purpose,"Despite all the wonderful graphic and its presentation, I feel that this book mainly intends to promote the desing firm. Although I learned some conceptual skill from this book, I would rather borrow it from a friend."
5,Loy Altomare: Portobello,"This cd is one of the best to come out from Loy Altomare. It is their best recording packed with all of their best songs. The CD has never been printed before and is very hard to find in stores, in fact this is the first I've seen it for sale. If you like Italian soft and easy music from the 1970's, this is the best cd for you."
1,might work for PS1 or Nintendo.,WARNING!!! Do not buy this product for the XBOX!!! The XBox will not fit in it (even though I found it under XBox accessories)
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"The one reason people buy this is to make there system stay a little more neater. Well guess what!! Don't buy this one, u put the console inside the plastic container and it will over heat while u play it. Don't get a majoir headache over somthing stupid like this. Just find somthing that is open but still keeps it nice. Your Very Welcome!!"
1,NO GOOD POS,I can tell you first hand that this is the most GOD-awful creation known to man. there is absolutly no reason you would buy this plastic piece of DOO DOO for 30 bucks when you can buy a similar plastic piece of DOO DOO for 15 at target.
2,not to good,"it is okay if you wanna just put a regular nes, snes, ps1, regular ps, sega genesis, whatever. as long as it is old and small. as for anything else, it will probly overheat on you or at least reduce the life of your system by about 6 years. most things will fit, but the tight space doesnt allow air cirulation. as for an xbox, well, an xbox wouldnt fit in any kind of container other than a reinforced dump truck. in the end, it would be better to just buy a tv stand or piece of furniture that holds tvs and has drawers and stuff. many are made to hold game consoles, vcr and dvd players and have special slots for cds, dvds, games, etc. So save yourself a couple bucks and a lot of headaches and skip this item"
1,The Worst,"I think that you would be better off buying a tv stand instead of buying that piece of plastic. It probably over-heats your game system, plus it might not be big enough. So for my review, I would say Do Not Buy This!!!"
5,Acid Kitchen of the Lost Souls,"Absolutely smashing band - it's irrelevant, whether it was acid or psychedelic. Next to it Country Joe shouldn't have stayed with the fishes, the Messenger could've been quick, but lost its way, while Stone Poneys were flogged to death.The music is not as light as ""Amphetamine Gazelle"", but Hammond as honestly howling like predator who just ate it. That's just raving madness - absolutely captivating.Nothing could be written better than Richie Unterberger did -Unknown Legends of Rock 'n' RollUrban Spacemen and Wayfaring Strangers: Overlooked Innovators and Eccentric Visionaries of '60s RockBoth albums of the most overseen and underrated act of San Francisco Bay pack of acid trippers - it's a giveaway."
5,5 Stars Rating,"Great Music: no doubt about it. Two of the greatest psychedelic rock albums of the '60s. A band incredibly ""unknown"" for the masses, which deserves much ""light"". Mad River (1969) is an extraordinary example of the creative ribellion borned in San Francisco Bay Area. Songs like ""High All The Time"", ""Wind Chimes"", ""War Goes On"" and the magnificient ""Eastern Light"" are masterpieces, following Grateful Dead or Quicksilver's classics of the time. ""Paradise Bar & Grill"" leaves electrical atmospheres for the acoustic country tune (as Dead did with Workingman's Dead and American Beauty), but Leave Me Stay signs a brief return on ""Mad River sound"".Sorry for my English, but it's not my language :D"
5,Better than calphalon as an all purpose pan!,"Cuisinart everyday stainless steel pans hold up to hard constant use. I have used this pan continuously since purchasing it a few months ago. It is sturdy and I like it much better than either my calphalon dutch oven, faberware stock pot, or anolon pan of the same sizes. I enjoy making pasta, chili, meat dishes-whatever needs cooking in this size pan. I like this cook ware so much that I am going to buy the 6 quart size pan as well. Sincerely,Gail B. Albuq. NM"
2,Disappointed,"In general, I have been very pleased with Cuisinart products and came to believe that Cuisinart was a brand I could count on to deliver durable products that made being in the kitchen pleasant. So when I saw these pots and pans I purchased them without much reservation. I have to say that so far I have been very disappointed with these pots and do not feel that they are worth the money. For one thing, I find that on my gas stove the handles get extremely hot (despite claims to the contrary) so potholders are an absolute must. Also, I have only had these pots for 2 months and have found that their durability is less than adequate. They scratch very easily, they dent easily (I gently hit one pot on my faucet acidentally when washing it and it dented), and are sometimes difficult to clean (food seems to really stick to them). Maybe my expectations were too high. Regardless, I find myself wishing that I had spent a little more and bought the All-Clad pots."
2,NATIONAL ASSOCIATION? START ELSEWHERE.,"Although this book is written on a fairly obscure topic, if you are looking to gain a better understanding of the National Association, I would suggest you begin elsewhere. Of the 329 pages, 70% of the material is of line-scores and box-scores. I was disappointed with the lack of insight and was left with a regurgitation of numbers. I think the author loses the historical context of the league by writing a book purely on numbers. If you are interested in the National Association, I suggest you start with Daniel Ginsburg&#65533;s The Fix Is In. Scandal and the National Association go hand in hand. Not only do you see how the league functioned, but also why it soon failed. I would also recommend William Ryczek&#65533;s book on the National Association. I found more substance in both cases than with Wright's book. Unless you are a stat fanatic...I would not buy this book."
4,Master magician and funnyman,"I just heard about Tommy Cooper by accident. One of my magician friends said he was an excellent stage magician, with a popular TV following in the UK. He even did some of the effects (what we magicians call tricks we do to sound pompous) that I do, and I wanted to see his presentation so I could steal some ... strike that so I could research other presentations to improve my own. This man is funny! with a capital Funny. Though he talks fast and is sometimes a bit hard to follow for one not used to real British English, he thoroughly entertains his audience - and the viewers of this collection of performances. If you like magic, and you want to see a master of crowd-pleasing stage magic at work, this is your video. No explanations of how the tric... I mean effects work, in most cases none are needed if you have studied magic at all. In any case, it's the entertaining way he presents that made him popular, and that lead me to recommend this VHS tape."
1,As substantial as fairy floss .........................,"The sisters sound good together, but the songwriting is the weak point. Maureen has said that she doubted her songwriting ability, and she wasn't wrong. Cliched lyrics and meandering melodies that all sound the same are a heavy burden for the sweet harmony vocals to carry.This is more a function of lack of life lived than anything else. As the years go by she's living more and writing from somewhere deeper, to much greater effect. Meanwhile, leave this cd in the bargain bin where it belongs."
4,Pleasing finicky cats #2,"It seems the formula has changed; it used to be flaky salmon with bits of rice ... this one is all together in little chunks. They liked the other formula better, but will eat this one. It's actually easier for me ... I had to cut up the flaked salmon, now I just mash it up with a little water."
5,KNIFES ARE NOW RAZOR SHARP,My sharpener needed some oil and new rods. I received the rods and it was very easy to install. I pulled the old ones off and slapped the new ones on.......... now every knife in my house is razor sharp.
2,flawed design,"decent, dense bottom; but the hollow handle transfers all the heat right into it, making it too hot to handle."
1,Buyer beware!,"Be very careful with these mats. I bought them form our GMC Yukon XL and they do NOT fit. They are misrepresented on the website and when I tried to cut them on the score lines to make the rear mats fit, they do not fit. I called customer service and they said to cut even more of the mat to make them fit in the middle, but this leaves several inches uncovered near the doors. Not satisfied, I attempted to return them and they will not since they have been slightly used and cut. Customer service had no sympathy and kept quoting that the mats are ""approximate"" and ""universal"" sizes, even thought it pulled up this specific mat form my make and model. They were unaccomodating and couldnt have cared less that it did not work for me. Front mats also move around on the carpet even though their wesite says they will not. Would definately NOT recommend this product."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE MATS!,"I saw the TV commercial for WeatherTech floor mats and was intrigued by the ""custom fit to your vehicle"" claims they made. I went to their website and ordered what was supposed to be mats for my 2004 Lexus IS300. I paid nearly $100 and basically received a universal set of rubber mats that had to be cut-down with scissors to barely fit in my car. Even after all the cutting, they still didn't fit quite right. The worst part was that last night, my accelerator pedal got caught under the mat lip and was stuck in the floored position. I was going 60mph in a 25mph zone. I quickly had to throw the car into neutral, slam on my brakes and reach down to dislodge the pedal from the mat. Had I not done this, I could have seriously injured myself or others. These mats are coming out of my car immediately and I will never order from their site again. Not only do I feel ripped-off by their deceptive advertising, but they also just put my life in danger."
4,Shrine of Stars,"McAuley's Confluence trilogy sets forth a new standard for SF to follow. Fully realized and philosophical, engaging and epic in scope, awe-inspiring and enigmatic. Shrine of Stars is remarkable and engrossing, and the Conflue trilogy has all the makings to become an SF classic, and required reading by SF enthusiasts everywhere. Gary S. Potter Author/Poet."
3,"An Interesting Future Saga, But One That's Overrated","I haven't read Paul McAuley's other books in his Confluence trilogy, but he is certainly deserving of praise as one of the better writers working in Anglo-American science fiction. That said, however, I did not find ""Shrine of Stars"" as mesmerizing or as profound as Dan Simmons' ""Hyperion"" saga or Gene Wolfe's science fantasy series, such as the ""Book of the New Urth"". Science fiction fans interested in reading great literature that's thematically similar to McAuley's Confluence trilogy would be well advised to read instead the works of Simmons and Wolfe. Yet those interested solely in entertainment should find McAuley's work both pleasurable and intriguing."
1,Flamenco on a steel string guitar? I don't think so...,"This is a very strange book - flamenco is not played on a steel string guitar, but the accompanying cd uses a steel string. That says a lot about the quality of this book. The pieces don't sound like flamenco and do not adhere to any of the flamenco forms, e.g., soleares, tangos, etc. Nor is there any emphasis on rhythm or accent, which is necessary to flamenco. Skip this book and get one of the many excellent books instead, such as ""Play Solos Flamenco Guitar with Juan Martin Book, CD, and DVD"", Gerhard Graf-Martinez's ""Flamenco Guitar Method"", and Juan Martin's flamenco guitar method ""El Arte Flamenco De La Guitarra"". Martin's flamenco solos book is filled with excellent pieces for every level of player, and even the simplest of them have a strong flamenco feel about them, with clear rhythms and accents, and excellent preformances of all the peices on both the accompanying cd and dvd.."
5,A book with incredible imagrey and compelling characters,This book is a compelling story with characters that literally come alive off the pages. I had a hard time putting it down. The story draws you in as you see the main character overcome adversity and find herself grow in the midst of lifes challenges. This book has a great spiritual message.Pick it up and start reading you wont be sorry !!
4,Illuminating Biography,"A well-done and enjoyable biographical portrait of the silent screen's premier actress - Mary Pickford. It traces her early career on the stage, through her rising prominence in early movies and association with D.W. Griffith and Adolph Zukor, the formation of United Artists, marriage to Douglas Fairbanks, to her fading stardom in the wake of talkies and her slow decline into an obscure reclusive figure of a bygone era. There was one little omission that irritated me: the fact that ""America's Sweetheart"" was in fact Canadian; the narrative says only that ""Gladys (Mary's original name) GREW UP in Toronto, Canada..."" Well, she was also BORN there...why fudge on the fact? Otherwise, the program is excellent and highly-recommended."
1,Do not buy from this company,"This company makes products that are useless. Unfortunately I did not read the other reviews before purchasing from them but now am experiencing first hand there shoddy workmanship, if you could even give them that. Used it for two days and worked ok, now just blows hot air. now I have to deal with all the hassle of returning, which I can probably only exchange it for another lemon. These products are a waste of money and given all the other negative feedback, this company should be reported to the better business bureau if they haven't already"
3,"""Best of You"" lacks the best of hooks from the band","""Best of You"" is the first from the double disc album ""In You Honor"" and to say in the least, it finds the Foo Fighters attempting to grow up. The tune is more sober than past singles and it seems as the band may have not but too many more ideas for a hook in their songs. The hook in the song is just Grohl singing 'best of you' repeatedly throughout the song and makes for not an immediate connectedness to a potential listener. There are past singles Grohl & company have released which the hook is not so appearant, but there was other things which covered what lacked from a song such as high-spirited guitars. There are plenty of great songs throughout history that lacks a good lyrical hook but there is not much a music hook either and compared to the band's past, this single is not the best of the band."
5,There is so much to love about this book!,"Your heart will melt watching a beautiful girl and her adorable puppy grow together! McKinley captures tender moments with incredible clarity through her rich black and white photography. The text is light and easy to read, perfect for a cozy bedtime story. Anyone who loves dogs -- especially these baby-faced King Charles Spaniels -- will cherish this book forever.Two paws up!"
1,I'm Steamed!,"I have really enjoyed the quality of all of my other Cuisinart cookware. Unfortunately, this tea kettle does not belong in the otherwise excellent product line. The kettle's shape makes it very difficult to pour. The handle conveys all of the heat of the boiling water, so you are not able to touch the handle without a hot pad. I have given up using the whistle attachment for two reasons: first, it is not made of Cuisinart's stainless steel (it appears to be made of plastic with a silver plastic coating), and so it has cracked and peeled from the heat; and second, it is impossible to remove the whistle when the kettle is hot so you are unable to pour your boiling water (often all that comes off when attempting to remove the whistle is the decorative ball on its tip!). I really wish that I had returned this tea kettle."
2,Poor cover design,"Cleaning is difficult and the cover is hard to remove, especially when the kettle is hot. Many times the cover has gotten stuck or the ball on the top has become loose and fallen off (with the screw falling into the boiling water)."
1,Not a good thing to spend you buks on !,I have been using this cattle for 7 months now. The handle ALWAYS gets very hot. The whistle is not usable any more.
2,Not for Children under 10,"While this book is fantasy and a good read, my wife and I pre-read the book due to it being assigned by our sons elementary school. He is 9 and in the 4th grade. I wasn't ready for him to be exposed to some of the underlying issues in the book. First, THE BOOK STATES that the tale of Santa Claus is a lie. So if you aren't ready for your kid to stop believing. Skip this book. The book is also based on someone that the children meet online by themselves. While it is funny to me as an adult, there are concerns about children surfing the net meeting very bad people who will try to convince them to come meet them just like the ""Alien"" does in this book. So if you are going to by a book for a young child to read on there own, buy something else."
3,Funny and boring,"I thought the book was okay. Some parts were boring. Some parts were funny. The parts BB-9 was not in the picture were the boring parts. If you are one of those people who can wade through boring parts, this is the right book for you!"
3,The Computer Nut,"The Computer Nut by Betsy Byars was funny and interesting, becuase Kate told jokes in the book. The charater BB-9 was funny too. Kate met BB-9 on her dads office computer when she was drawing a self-portrait for fun. I think, the author wrote this book for people who are into Fantasy. BB-9 was a robot that come down from a weird sounding planet. I give this book three stars becuase, the character BB-9 talked way diffrent from people from earth and, he acted weird so, that made it difficult to understand."
2,The Computer Nut by Besty Byars,I thought this book was not as great as i had expected i to be. I had to wait for 3 weeks for the book to come and I was so exited and then when it came it was a total disappointment. I thought that the alien B-B-9 was to simple and Kates friend Linda was not really needed. If you like mystery or adventure this book is not for you.
3,A good book to engage computery kids,"I read this book ages ago when I was in the 5th grade and loved it. It was one of the first books that I flew through due to the presence of the theme: opening up a world to a child through the computer.What has always amazed me is that the book was written in '86, but you could read it today and understand how the computer worked because of our current usage of the Internet. That said, the author didn't foresee the common dangers of online computer usage today.The Computer Nut had an impact on me as a child, but decades later, it just isn't modern enough to deal with the on-line issues that children are presented with today.Upon a re-read in the seventh grade, I found the book to be boring. So I'd put the age of the intended reader somewhere between 10 and 12."
4,Excellent Adventure Story! (Earns 4 1/2 Stars),"Pretty good story. Linda gets Kate into deep trouble, like... well, you can find out if you read the book. I would rate this book a five, but there is a section that, I must say, is pretty boring, but I still am urging you to read the book."
2,Not too good.,"Although somewhat interesting, this book misses the mark. If you like computers and aliens, consider reading this book. It is poorly written."
2,"Just your average ""America's the Good Guy"" propoganda.","This novel is little more than a paranoid interpritation of what could have happened if the USA hadn't beaten Hitler. I an ashamed I bought this book, it isn't even Science Fiction, just another trash thriller."
1,"Newt, please stay with politics!","This is definitely the second worst book I ever read. Nothing, but nothing is even reasonably the way Hitler and his henchmen would have behaved in speech and action. Even a little research through the large mass of serious research material would have caused the two writers to abstain from writing such idiotic trash.As an alternate history, ....eeeeh! mebbe, just mebbe! What grated on my nerves was the especially dumb way German words and phrases were manhandled. If you don't have a German handy, don't write in German, Newt.I found this book especially silly because I had the great honor and extreme pleasure to be in Europe throughout World War II and can guarantee you that nobody who was German ever used the phrase (translated verbatim ) ""sh*t in heaven"".Please, newt, stay with politics here you can shine. Just don't write such trash anymore, please."
3,Competent alternate history on an overworked what-if.,"As a long-time fan of alternate histories, I got ahold of this book as soon as I could. The premise---that Hitler was out of action due to injuries when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, and that without a declaration of war by Germany, Roosevelt could not bring the US into the European Theatre, is plausible and has been examined in other alternate histories.On the whole, I thought it was a competent, Clancyesque job. Although not up to the level of the true classics of the genre, it appeared to be reasonably well-done, with historical characters behaving as they might actually have in these altered circumstances. In my own opinion, a lot of the savaging this book got was due to antagonism against the author-of-record's political stances, instead of being based on an honest reaction to the book itself. It deserves a chance on its own merits."
2,Tom Clancy imitation,"The premise of the book is intriguing, but the execution failed. This reads like a bad copy of a Tomy Clancy novel. Having James Bond-like special ops running during WWII is already a bit of a deviation from the period norm, and of course the good guys dodge bullets. It was light reading, though, and I got through it in a day."
4,Great alternate history for WWII buffs,"Gingrich/Forstchen write an amazing tale, a real page-turner for WWII buffs who have always wondered ""what if..."" the plot is plausable the action fast paced and Forstchen brings out the war as catalyst for mans advancement theme every bit as well as in his Lost Regiment series. Waiting for Forstchen to get back to this project is becoming painful. Aircorps buffs Gothas V. RATOCats... Nuff' said!! FORSTCHEN get to it man!!"
4,It got me in from the first chapter. I'm eager for more !,"I picked this book up at an outback South Australia newsagent whilst desperate for something to read on vacation. Mills and Boon isn't my cup of tea so 1945 was the best option. Imagine my surprise (and my wife's disgust) when the holiday took a back seat. I simply could not put it down. I had to keep telling myself that this was not how WWII ended. Since then I have hunted high & low for the sequels only to find out through other readers comments that it isn't yet published. Newt, how can you do this to me ! Hurry up for my sake and all the other readers like me. Take off your politician's hat and do things quickly for a change."
3,A chilling look at an alternate history,"Excellent book. I just love ...what if's... especially when it comes to WWII. This is an especially chilling look at an alternate history and a good account on what it would be like if our homeland were invaded....Unfortunately, just when it's at it's best....TO BE CONTINUED............Bill..... PLEASE WRITE THE SEQUEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,1945,The company sent me a book that was in very good condition.I would order from this company again in the future. I givethem three stars.
2,"Newt, Stick with politics!","Politically, I agree with Newt, for the most part. I enjoyed ""Pearl Harbor"", but found the follow-up (""Days"") a bit boring. This book was interesting in the beginning, but once the action started...GAG ME! In this 1940s story, the word ""paradigm"" was used often when referring to a new way of looking at something...yet it was'nt until the 1960s that this word meant anything other than a descriptor of grammer. The last words in the book were ""To be continued"". I hope not."
3,Clancy knock-off,"Way too much setup at the beginning with the Jim Martel-This is your life! section. The fast paced scene changes are the same as pioneered by Clancy years ago. Once you get past the setup, the action is engaging, making the book hard to put down. Just remember... it's *fiction*. I didn't care much for NG as a politico, but he's a reasonably fair fiction writer. Maybe we'll get part 2 now that he's got some time on his hands."
2,"Above average read, interesting mix of historical characters","I read the book while sitting on a plane during a trip. I found the beginning a bit slow, but then the book picked up. The lead American is a bit to cliche, i.e. Bruce Willis type action hero, but likeable enough. Lame ending without the continuation in print. I also think the leak in the White House was a bit unrealistic given the paranoia of the day."
2,"Well, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be...","...but that would be hard to do.It's basically straight military fiction, revolving around the planning, execution, and fighting off of the strike on Oak Ridge - but for the AH theme, it could be a middling Tom Clancy book.Danger, Will Robinson: Much to your surprise, you will discover in the last chapter that this bookhas at least one unwritten sequel planned, and thus it just sort of ends in the middle of the setup for the next book (and as sales were... disapointing for the first book, a second now is unlikely).And this setup strikes me as stretching disbelief just a bit.Not something I'd recommend buying, but if you're bored, and it's available at the library..."
1,Bad. Very bad.,"A lame attempt to traverse the terrain Robert Harris already covered- far better -in ""Fatherland"". Even though this book is called ""1945"", most of it occurs in 1946. Go figure. Gingrich's characters are dull and the book slows to a glacial pace when his American hero steps onto the page. Was I the only one disturbed by the fact that the Nazi characters are the best written? Maybe the worst book I ever read."
4,great book Newt! when is the sequel coming?,quickly gets your attention. very enjoyable read.certainly makes you think about what might have been.
4,Surprisingly Good SF Alternate History from a Politician,"Of course Forstchen was also invoved. The only way I could have imagined that Germany might have won WWII in Europe was as described in the text. Hitler was injured and in a coma prior to Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. His lieutenants preserved German troops during the Russian Winter (no genius needed) and didn't declare war on the U.S. Thus Roosevelt wasn't able to convince Congress to open a two-front war, and Germany was alone in Europe. England had to sue for peace, and Germany took everything else. And it's a rattling good story in 1945 with Germany looking to beat out the U.S. to the Atomic bomb. Only kvetch is that hero is too perfect, but it's still interesting. Where is next installment??"
4,"Gripping - a page turner, where is the follow-up?!",As an avid reader of spy and techno thrillers this book immediately hooked me. The character development is as complete as necessary. While not in the class of Tom C. this first novel was interesting and I am looking forward to the sequel.The thesis is plausible and suggests some ideas that may be good policy
3,1945,"Ends with "" To Be Continued"" That was 16 years ago.....just like his politics! The last chapter was drawn out and thats when I had a gut feeling this was not going to be a THE END book. Too bad......"
4,A very good read,"Excellent page turner! An alternative version of WW2 revolving around a daring German attack on the US Atomic facilities... Really enjoyed it, very detailed and lots of 'what ifs...' The sudden ending really needs a sequel.."
2,Do NOT bother with this - you will hate the unfinished ending!,"Being a history buff, I read this and really do not care that Newt Gingrich has his name added to the authorship. What I DID like was the premise and setting.What I HATED was the incredibly bad prose, poor character development, and implausable plot twists. Sure, the military hardware was well researched and the hsitorical figures are all resurrected but the overall result is an embarresment.And - the incomplete ending ""to be continued"" WILL NOT BE PUBLISHED!Go read a romance novel and stop wating your time with this!"
3,"Enjoyable page turner, but a little uneven","First off, let me say I'm not a fan of Newt Gingrich. However, I did find the idea of the story fascinating. I'm just getting into Alternate History and I like to compare and contrast these works with those of historians such as Stephen Ambrose.The writing isn't bad, but it's fairly uneven. The characterizations are interesting as well as behind-the-scenes political and tactical manuevering. However, some of the dialogue seems out of place for 1945 and the characterizations and dialogue for the 2 women who appear in the story are just plain silly.It's a good page turner and both authors appear to be quite knowledgeable about military hardware, but toward the end it does trend toward military geek-speak.Too bad to hear about the sequel; maybe Newt can put it on his Web page ala Stephen King and you can download in serial form."
4,VERY GOOD BOOK BUT WHERE IS THE D*MN SEQUEL!?,"A very good read, but also very frustrating. If this book was written in '95-96, why has it taken so long to write a sequel?"
4,1945 - Alas no two!,"It was an entertaining book. While the raid was a bit of a strech, but so were other things like the Doolittle raid or the Dam busters and the countless commando raids, which were all seen in WWII. It is disappointing since it sets you up for a good series and then fails to deliver due to people letting politics get in the way of a good book. It ain't Clancy, but it was a good idea."
4,I enjoyed this book a lot. Occasional melodramatic prose.,"1945 presents us with a plausable alternate WW2 history. Whatif Hitler has been badly injured in a plane crash on June 6,1941. With a trio of Generals in charge, Germany did notdeclare war on the USA after Pearl Harbor, and concentratedon war with Russia. Roosevelt responding to a Congress demandingrevenge in the Pacific commits everything to a Pacific war whichleads to Japan's defeat without Nukes in 1944. Before Hitlerrecovers, Germany sets up a quasi independant Ukraine whichjoins the war against the communists, eventually forcingRussia to sue for peace. The Churchill government collapses andGermany with a recovered Hitler is the undisputed master ofmost of Europe. The world now has two superpowers. Germanyand The United States. It is 1945."
3,"A good read, but not the best","I first read 1945 six years ago, and recently picked it back up after hearing about Gettysburg, another forthcoming collaberation by the authors. Gingrich and Forstchen do any amiable job in fabricating this world, but I can't help but feel as though the authors wanted to give it something more, but settled for a romance novel. World War II scenarios have been almost as popular in this sub-genre as the Civil War, but I don't believe anyone has come close to matching Fatherland or The Man in the High Castle, unless you count an alien invasion by Turtledove (which I enjoyed despite the romance aspect). Personally, I'm still waiting for the follow-up.Also recommended for WWII fans: Rutman's A Clash of Eagles and with a slightly different twist, Under the Yoke by S.M. Stirling."
4,Very good book... when is the sequel?,"The premise is very believable. Many times I myself have wondered why Hitler inexplicably kept his word to his Japanese Allies (for the first time in his career, he did what he said he would), by declaring war on the US. He had absolutely nothing to gain by this action. The plot line flows well, with Martel (hero) showing just enough self-conscious angst mixed with brilliant deduction. He is a very likable character. Some of the ""unknown"" (ie, not historical) characters are a bit thin, but not too bad. Come on guys, let's get that ""to be continued"" going."
3,"Ok book. Lame ending, some good action scenes.","The most interesting aspect of the novel is the ""what if"" scenario it presents involving Hitler. I found the proposed sequence of events extremely plausible and was thouroughly enjoying the book until about midway through. Suddenly, Martel gains superhuman abilities and foils a German invasion single handedly. Then an American militia led by a mythical American super-shot comes in to mop up the left overs. I understand that suspension of disbelief is an important part of reading fiction but the end of this book is ludicrous. And finally, the ending scene is the worst I have ever read - ever. The book does have some strong points - action sequences for example. But in comparison to other novels they are mediocre at best. While the opening chapters are promising, 1945 fails to live up to its potential."
2,"Gimmicky plot, and historically a real stretch.","The characters of York, Patton, Marshall, Halsey, and MacArthur were gimmicky. Patton and York were based on the interpretations of George C. Scott and Gary Cooper not the real thing. Even some of the lines are straight from the movies.As for the plot itself, not likely. The Soviets and the British were by no means done in '41. The Germans were caught. If they fight through the winter, then you get what actually happened. If they stop and wait, the Russians get the time they need to regroup. The winter helped beat the Wehrmact, but the Russians did the lions share on their own. I give Rommel, Patton, Montgomery, and the other generals their due, but the best mind in that war was Zhukov. The Soviets would have been fine without the winter or the United States.This is sentimental fiction, not historical, but if you're willing to susepend your disbelief, not a bad way to spend a couple of hours."
1,Both authors' first attempt at alternate history,"This is the worse book written by Gingrich and Forstchen. Later novels were much better,with the Civil War trilogy the best of them all. I excuse the two authors for 1945 asthey were just getting their feet wet with alternate history."
4,1945 is one of the best alternate history books out to date.,I found 1945 an exciting alternate history with agood prehistory explantion and excellent story line. I highly recommend this book to alternate history buffs.
2,Unusual mix of Lloyd Webbers Phantom of the Opera title song,"Lloyd-Webber's Phantom of the Opera as you've never heard it before! A mix of techno/pop styles of the song ""The Phantom of the Opera"" sung by Robert Guillaume (played the Phantom in L.A.) If you are a Phantom fan and like hearing different versions of the title song - everything from electro-groove to pop, instrumental, and complete vocals - then this is for you."
4,Good works!,This item is exactly as illustrated and advertised. It works great. The reception on my HD TV improves dramatically.
1,Got the rare dud.,"Bought this item for about $3 shipped. I have bought bargain cables before so I have no qualms about the quality of inexpensive cables in general. I received a dud on my last order. The cable just did not work, not in any of the HDMI ports and not with any known good equipment. It does not look damaged and the ends fit snugly into the ports. It was just a bad cord. It was too cheap to be worth returning; I knew at this price a bad cable was possible. The single star was for the dud cable but bargaincell/eforcity delivery was prompt and the item was appropriately packaged. If I were rating the store and not the product, I would give more stars.Probably the only thing to take away from this review is that if this cable is going to ordered for a ""must work"" situation (e.g. you are ordering for the Super Bowl) order a multi-pack or a backup cable. Duds are relatively rare but they do happen."
3,"cheap, works but looks fragile","it works well, crisp images on my monitor, no flickering, no interference. It is just that the cable looks thin but at the same time not flexible enough that I am afraid that, if I fold it too strong in a U-shape instead of natural spirals without cable tension, then it may break.But it works well and got it quickly and at a very competitive price, so no worries so far!"
1,Horrible!,"First off, I am a Computer Networks/Electronics major at college, so I know what I'm talking about. I understand that if a digital cable works, then it doesn't matter how much it is or what materials it's made of, the picture quality will be exactly the same. That is why I bought this cable. It seemed to have good reviews, so I went with a cheap cable. What a mistake! The HDMI end of the cable literally crumbled in my hand when I went to insert it into my PS3. I have never seen such horrible craftsmanship. If you want a decent cable, go with the Amazon branded cable. It has a warranty, and has much better construction."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this cable so I could use my 46"" LCD television as an extra monitor, but unfortunately the cable I got was defective. I went through a bunch of troubleshooting and even contacted the manufacturer of my television, but it was indeed the cable. It would cost more for me to return for a refund or even an exchange than the actual cable itself is worth. All in all, you get what you pay for."
5,"works great for PC to HDTV, and way cheaper than big box stores","I used the cable to hook my dvi video card on a windows based pc to my panasonic hdtv. Works great at 1080P, no complaints. I'm so glad I didn't blow 50 bucks on the same thing at best buy."
4,Good Value,"Works well to hook a computer DVI output up to a HDTV HDMI input. To get sound you will need a separate cable from the sound card. Wish I got one a little longer though. Good Value, the big boxes really rip you off on high priced cables."
5,Buy no other cable.,"Its a cost effective cable. While being cheap in terms of price, it seemed ever so sturdy to me. Spending any more elsewhere than what I paid for this would seem stupidity. The gold plating seems good enough. I am entirely contented ."
4,Works just fine,"Not much to say about this. Connects one device to another. No problem, really. I use it for my PC."
3,didn't use yet,i actually brought this to connect my laptop to my tv but it was too big so i couldn't try it out whenever i can try it i will review it better
5,Never pay high prices for HDMI cables!,"Works as advertised. One of the best prices for an HDMI cable.Do NOT pay the crazy $70 to $150 for HDMI cables at the retail stores. These cables are EXACTLY the same.In fact these cables even have an RF Choke on both ends of the cable.I purchases the following cables from this company:HDMI to DVI to connect...iMac 20"" Intel CoreDuo 2.0 GHz computer to mySharp Aquos LC46D62U 46"" 1080p LCD HDTV. The picture quality is excellent.HDMI to HDMI to connect...Sony PS3 to mySharp Aquos LC46D62U 46"" 1080p LCD HDTV. The picture quality is excellent."
5,Outstanding performance and cheap!,"What can i say, I bought one of these cables several months ago to hook up my DVI laptop to my tv HDMI input. I liked it so much, I purchased a second one for my other television. It works exactly as you expect. Construction quality is great, picture quality is great. I don't think the higher priced ones will do any better (though I have not tried). I liked this cable enough to come back and leave some positive feedback so others can benefit."
5,Hookup PS3 to older HDTV sets,"This cable works very well and you can't beat the price. I used it to connect an older Sony HDTV set that does not have HDMI, only DVI or component video for HD programming. I was able to connect my PS3 and am now able to get the maximum my set can produce 1080i. The only difficulty is audio but I was able to use the PS3 included analog audio/video cable and found a setting on the PS3 under Sound Settings for multi output meaning the RCA audio cables give me sound and this cable the video. HDMI unlike DVI carries both video and audio and the PS3 sees this as an HDMI cable so by default it disables the analog cables. I highly recommend this for anyone with older HDTV sets that have DVI inputs."
4,Great cable but a shipping error!,"I bought this cable to hook up my Xbox to my new monitor and the picture quality is great! No ghosting and it works! The cable arrived on time but it was the wrong cable! I emailed them and they responded fast and shipped out the right cable the next business day. The cable arrived in about 4-5 business days. Tracking info was received both times my order was shipped out. I don't like the fact that they messed up my order and had to wait longer to use my cable but they corrected it and let me keep the wrong cable they sent. P.S to anyone who is connecting this to their Xbox and using the AV cable/s-video cable for audio,you wont be able to watch Netflix or DVDs without the audio dongle! Tried it and doesn't work!! THE HDCP ERROR POPS UP ON THE SCREEN. U get audio but NO VIDEO!"
4,Works Fine,"Quality is superb, the only complaint is that I had to force it into my HDMI port with a little extra force, nonetheless great product."
5,Solid built video cable,"I use this cable everyday to hook my laptop up to my LCD display. It is made out of nice thick cable, but is still bendable enough to work with it."
2,HDMI ON PS3,I THINK IT IS REALLY GOOD FOR ITS PRICE BUT ON MY PS3 IT FLICKERS ALOT WHEN WATCHN BLURAY MOVIES BUT ITS GREAT DURING GAME PLAY AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR SOMEONE WHO DONT WANT TO SPEND TO MUCH.
1,Don't get for Macs,"I got this to connect my MacBook Pro to an HDTV, to no avail. When I connected it, the screen would flash blue once then refuse to detect the external display. I took the setup in to an Apple Store, where switching computers had the same effect. We then switched to their $26 Belkin DVI to HDMI cable and had everything work perfectly.Yeah, it's only a few dollars on Amazon with shipping, but it's not worth even that for Mac users - this seems to be a frequent problem."
3,Good product for the price,Picture quality is not the best but good. Good product for the price. I rather by this then separate converter and an hdmi cord. Good option to consider.
2,i guess????,i had dvi to vga and i thought if i used this cable that it would give me even better video. no i didnt it gave me video but poor blurry quality video. the picture didnt even fit on my 19'' sony bravia kdl-19m400. the color was funny looking. if you have dvi to dvi great. dvi to vga cool. dvi to hdmi dont!!!
1,PURPLE PICTURE,IT WORKED WELL FOR 15 MINUTES. AFTER THAT THE HD CHANNELS LOOKED GREAT BUT THE OTHER CHANNELS WERE A SHADE OF PURPLE.
1,didn't work at all,"I bought this cable with the hopes that it would connect my ps3 to my soyo 22' monitor and it didn't do it at all. All it gives me is a blank screen, even when I reset the ps3 video output it didn't work. I know my monitor is hdcp compliant, so the cable is at fault."
