2,Avoid the Baking Section,"I bought this book for its unique collection of British desserts and baked goods recipes. Having now baked about 5 of the recipes (and I am an experienced home baker), I'd say 4 of them were pretty poor (Christmas fruitcake was good). Maybe the recipes don't translate well to American ovens, but buyer beware."
5,A wonderful and refreshing show,"Simple Living with Wanda Urbanska presents five episodes of the popular public television series designed to teach the viewer about ways for more cost-effective, conscientious, and sustainable living. The first nationally syndicated series of this kind, Simple Living shows ways ordinary people everywhere can be better stewards of the environment and more informed consumers, while promoting a strong, positive message of fiscal responsibility and community involvement. From reducing one's carbon footprint to doing a ""green remodel"" of one's home to enjoying the pastime of gardening, Simple Living with Wanda Urbanska is a wonderful and refreshing show - the frugality and energy-saving tips especially are and more valuable than ever during tough economic times. Highly recommended. 135 minutes."
4,Practical purchase...,"I had to get this for a graduate class, and it was well worth the money, practical ideas to use in my coaching position every day."
5,Self-Change Hypnosis,I have just finished reading Richard's new book Self-Change Hypnosis.What a lovely little book filled with golden nuggets of advice. The chapter on making your own hypnosis tapes is very good with instructions for making your own tapes ranging from smoking to public speaking.The book ends with a good brief history on hypnosis.All in all this book is well worth the money and if the simple instructions are followed the reader will achieve successful results. As a hypnotist of 14 years I found the book full of reminders.As with most things in life mastering the basics is the key to a wonderful existence.There is golden nuggets in this book.Paul Hastingswww.realsmart-hypnosis.com
1,Self published unprofessionalism,"[...]As for the content... Well, about all I can say is there is some. Probably less than you'd find on a decent website about hypnosis. The introduction is a pep talk, telling us how great hypnosis is. Then comes the single induction script, then a few odds and ends and a couple of scripts for specific issues, before a section on the history of hypnosis, obviously included as padding.Reading this book tends to raise more questions than it answers. The less enquiring mind may find that this is all they need to know to achieve success with hypnosis. However, those who want to truly understand how and why hypnosis works, in order to apply it most successfully, will find little of value here. Similarly, those with complicated or persistent issues, will not find any detailed information on how to deal with them."
2,"Pamphlet, not a book","As a beginner, I did not find this book helpful at all. First of all, this ""book"" has the same amount of content as a pamphlet. I finished it in about 30 minutes. This guy was clearly just trying to make a quick buck and not worried about content or quality. Disappointing for my first shot at something I'm very interested in."
5,About Time A********,"I have read and rubbished loads of self-help books due to the fact that they could not be understood! Well at last, our friend from the other side of the pond, Richard MacKenzie has come through with what I think to be a future #1 bestseller!Don't get confused with 'Self Change Hypnosis's' simplicity! This is an extremely powerful book that will change your life forever!I spoke with Richard MacKenzie this week to congratulate him on this title and he said that when he wrote the book he wanted it to appeal to uneducated and educated individuals... Well he has certainly achieved this, even my 11 year old son can follow the instructions and get results!"
5,Richard MacKenzie makes self transformation accessible to everyone,Richard MacKenzie's Self Change Hypnosis book brings the possibility for true personal transformation to people of all socio-economic and educational backgrounds. This book explains the concepts and tools needed by anyone interested in self transformation in a sensitve and simple manner that makes it understandable and usable by a wide audience. I have read a number of similar books on self-hynosis but will always refer to this one as the gold standard and will go back to it regularly as different concepts become relevant to ones life process as one reads the book through time. The various scripts and exercises provided in the book allow the reader to get started with personal change from the very first reading.
5,What an investment! Easy to follow! A*,This is such a great book that I really felt compelled to write this review! I would recommend it to everyone as a must read!!!!Simply put: It really WORKS!!!!

5,BEST SOUNDING REGGAE CD EVER!,The Wailing Souls' great Psychedelic Souls CD was the 1st Reggae CD that turned me on to Reggae. I was eagerly anticipating getting this awesome Reggae CD on Japanese Import since my domestic CD just sounded fairly good. The Japanese Import CD sounds absolutely wonderful! In fact it's so much better than the domestic release that it's a whole new enlightening experience. This is a must have for any Reggae fan.
3,A broad interpretation of 'lounge',"Solaris is a hip beach-resort in the Netherlands. They organized shows with names that when they played there were quite unknown but are huge now: Yonderboi, Nitin Sawney, Roni Size, Jimi Tenor, Dorfmeister and King Britt, to name a few. Solaris had 'lounge' music before this term became so popular, and this cd is a compilation is what they name 'chill out music'... On this very varied cd you'll get classic (Francis Pouleric) next to eighties disco (Balihu), acid jazz (Atmosfear, Bob Sinclair), ambient (Moby) and well, filmmusic...:-) (Arling and Cameron) Alltogether not a very consistent collection, the last track is even very misplaced (Concerto Pour 2 Pianos, Allego Ma Non Troppo) on this cd."
1,Kinda odd...and not in a good way,"When I heard this was some of the music used in the 70s kung fu movie era I was quite excited to check it out. However this is not a very good collection of music pieces.The worse problem with this CD is that so many of the songs sound almost identical that you want to skip through them when you get to them. The second disk is a bit better with more listenable tunes, but over all I would say this is not a good way to spend $20."
3,Game of telephone anyone?,"Most of the book is pretty good, I have a number of specialeffects books in my collection and have subscribed to CINEFEX magazine for many years. However there seem to be facts that are not checked and therefore some inaccuracies. The best example I can think of is the description of how Robby the Robot was constructed. The books describes fairly precisely the prosses know as Vacu-Form though never labels it. Which is odd because from all other accounts Robby was Fiberglass and there was only one made. If he was Vacu-Formed, a simple prosses once set up and molds made the studio doubless would have made at least three, if for no other reason that he would have be fragile. I may be nit picking. An I could be wrong"
2,Great price but,I bought this manifold thinking that it was a great deal. The reality is that it is really close to being a great deal. The issue I had with it was the five holes on the top accept NPT fittings just fine. The hole on each end though was not drilled and tapped deep enough to allow use of an NPT fitting and have it seal. It leaked out of both ends. I finally plugged both ends with a brass fitting and JB Weld. Seems to be kind of a silly way to have to seal up an NPT fitting.
5,DON'T STOP THE MUSIC,"MARTHA REDBONE'S debut CD HOME OF THE BRAVE is a must add to your music collection. She's a songwriter, producer, and songtress. This woman is multi-talented and after listening to the CD, you'll understand why. She has a very soulful voice. It's hard to categorize her into one genre, so I'll say she's a neo-soul, pop, R & B singer,SAY YOU LOVE ME, BOYFRIEND and UNDERDOG are my favorite cuts on the CD.Don't let a good thing past you by, get HOME OF THE BRAVE and relax after a long week."
3,Threads by Nell Gavin,This book is filled with 'life lessons' that we all can benefit from in a fun and sometimes disturbing manner. Having studied the Tudor dynasty for 20+ years I would recommend it to people who want entertained rather than any historical benefit. I enjoyed it but it really could have been about anybody.
3,Could have been so much better,"This is the perfect example of what could have been, but wasn't. The idea of reincarnation is intriguing, but Ms. Gavin is long on writing and short on dialogue or action. While it's written using the voice of Anne Boleyn, it never quite caught my interest or kept my attention. Frankly, it was almost as though the author was going for the ""artsy"" crowd and forgot to stay on track with her story.Having said that, there were points that really delivered. As sad as it was, the Chinese life was one of the best written. It kept me riveted from the beginning to the end. I just wish the rest of the book had been of that caliber."
5,Simply marvelous! Powerful writing!,"I just finished reading Threads: The Reincarnation of Anne Boleyn. I am at a loss to write a review that does it justice. I absolutely loved this book.On the surface it is the story of Queen Anne (Boleyn) of England. However, it is a multi-layered book that takes careful reading to discover the 'hidden' layers. Please take the time to read it carefully so you won't miss anything. It is worth it to do so.The writer (Nell Gavin) tells the story as if she herself were Anne Boleyn telling us what happened to her in her life as Queen Anne of England, and in other lives as well. The writing is so skillful that I keep wondering how she (Nell) made Threads so realistic that I find myself believing that every word of this book could be true, SHOULD be true. It's as if the author of Threads channelled Anne Boleyn in order to tell this story.Wonderfully powerful writing. Great job (no - fabulous job), Nell Gavin!Kristie Leigh Maguireauthor ofSecond Chancesand other titles"
4,Got me thinking,"I think I've read just about every book on Anne Boleyn that exists, but this one was much different than the norm. The reincarnation theme simultaneously appealed to me and turned me off. I found that I actually enjoyed reading about the ""other"" Annes and Henrys than the ones we know by those names.At the conclusion of the book, I spent some time thinking about the concept of ""karmic debt"" and what lessons are waiting to be learned. I am ambivalent on the idea of reincarnation, but I've found it to be true that for many of us, we keep making the same mistakes over and over in life - perhaps in different guises, but frequently the same at heart. Fictionalizing one's ""issues"" and creating ""past life"" similar experiences might be an interesting therapy tool for the creative."
1,Don't waste your money on this book,"Please don't let yourself be sucked into buying this book because of the low price. I am a lover of all things Tudor, and read primarily historical fiction, and I hated this book. I couldn't manage to finish it.It just plodded along, with bits of plot interspersed with hideous ramblings about reincarnation. I am as open to the idea of reincarnation as any religious idea, but this is truly awful.Seriously, I have read several books over the years that center around the characters' religous beliefs, or have an underlying theme of incorporating faith as an integral part of life, but this is just a revolting bore. I cannot imagine why this book was even published.Do yourself a favor, and don't read this book. Really."
5,I liked this book,I really liked this book. If you're looking for scholarly history this isn't it. If you'd like to read something that will have you thinking outside the usual Tudor box then this is for you. It was charming and an easy read. I love reading about Anne Boleyn and the Tudors. This was fun!
1,how can such an interesting topic be so boring?,"i honestly don't know, but somehow the author took a fascinating topic, set up a completely new premise, and then seemed to forget that it also needed to be interesting. Anne is one dimensional; I'm more than halfway through and still now nothing about Henry other than that she is obsessed with him and they have a relationship. there is no emotion, no connection, with anyone in this book.Big Yawn. dont waste your time."
2,There are better books,I found this book to be very interesting. The first part of the book is very cut and dry. Basically a narrative of the life of Anne Boleyn as told by her from heaven. The reincarnation stories can be a little bit boring and the ending just hangs there. Even if you are interested in the Tudors this is not the book to buy.
1,Ridiculous,"Nothing like I expected it to be. Although the concept was intriguing, there was too much talk and not enough action. It's story line had potential, but the book just kind of dragged on. I don't remember one time that I eagerly turned the page because I couldn't wait to see what happened next. I'm not sure how this book could be considered a fantasy, I thought it was silly more than anything else. I'm fascinated with the Tudor era, so I was really excited to read this book, but I was very disappointed."
1,Couldn't finish this book,"I tried, but I could not finish this book. It was too much going back and forth. The characters were reincarnated into people that didn't make any sense to the actual person. The idea of reincarnation is nice, but it was just too much. I just kept trying to get into the book because I love Tudor history. In the end, I just gave up.Threads: The Reincarnation of Anne Boleyn"
1,Awful,"One poorly written bore. Henry V111 would day ""off with the authors head. Don't waste your time and money. Ugh"
2,Blah Blah Blah,"Wayyyyy too many flowery words, not enough of consequence. Jumping back and forth, hither and yon, t'was difficult to maintain any kind of reader rythm. I kept waiting for something to happen, but the author kept describing feelings, thoughts and impressions. Never made it half way through the book."
5,Essence of the Southwest,Mr.August has a special gift to capture the essence of the southwest. Dare to close your eyes and be whisked away by a myraid of sounds that take you through canyons and valleys that dazzle the imagination while the soul is transported to it's Creator. This collection of music has become one of my favorites and I look forward to future projects by this talented artist.
5,Excellent Relaxing Music,Scott August is a very talented Native American flute player. His music has a tranquilizing effect. It's difficult to explain what it's like but try to imagine getting transported into a different world. I often sleep to his music because it is so relaxing.
1,Never arrived,USPS is not a reliable shipping method. I tracked this package as it was first sent to the city I live in and then on to about 2 other states and finally delivered to someone in a totally different state from where I live. The worst part was there was NO human being to be talked to at either Amazon or the post service. Makes me leary to buy again from Amazon.
5,My review of this product,"I love the benefiber caplets. No gritty taste like some of the powder things available that you mix with water or juices. I only need 1 caplet per day and not the recommended 3 per day. Benefiber is the only thing that works perfect for my constipation. I sure will be glad when Norvartis starts up production again. There is a lot of price gouging going on Amazon and Ebay since this product is hard to find now. Money will cause many people to take advantage of others. There is nothing wrong with making a profit but $70 bucks for a bottle of benefiber....give me a break. Still, I love benefiber and it is the only thing that works for me."
2,Dated material -- Find a better source,"The information in this book is out of date. Techniques discussed are no longer in use as they've been replaced with safer practices.Better approaches to buddy procedures, use of trimix and heliox beginning at depths of 100' and other techniques are NOT mentioned, although they should be. Equipment configurations are not fully discussed with modern emphasis on more streamlined, cleaner configurations."
5,Very informative. A must-have for the deep diver's library.,Highly recommended for those already doing deep diving or people who are considering getting into it. It also serves as an excellent reference for divers seeking additional information outside of their classrooms.
1,Very poor writing,"This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever seen. It reads like a very bad first draft of a book, or a transcript of some rambling interview. Obviously the author knows a lot about diving, and has some strong opinions about it, but the writing is disorganised and incoherent, the details are sloppy, the writing is vague on almost every technical issue, and the quoted references are mostly absent."
4,Recommendation recently in Fanfare (May-June 09 issue)!,"Apparently, this 3-CD set recorded in 1994 has been re-packaged by Nuova Era and is listed at a bargain price in the Marketplace. I have a number of Sammartini discs, including a Naxos recording of some of these works performed by Aradia Ensemble on modern instruments.Presently reading a review by Jerry Dubins in the most recent issue of Fanfare - the performances are on period instruments (which is one reason that I will likely put this offering on my 'wish list') and the set is recommended by Dubins; thus, I believe the rating should be higher than the current average - although I've not heard the discs yet, I will be ordering the package soon and will report back (and adjust my rating accordingly)."
2,Disappointing performances,"This is underrated music that deserves to be heard, but unfortunately these performances do not come close to doing it justice. Compared with many of the better baroque and early music ensembles, this group simply does not measure up. The performances rarely rise above the routine and frankly make the music sound boring (which it isn't). Very disappointing, especially as most of these works are not otherwise available."
4,Smokin' Aces,It's a good movie collection for a great price. Just FYI to all other buyers its a box set with two movies indivdually case not just two movies in one case.
3,smokin'aces1 and 2,"WHILST THE DVDS SHOWED PROMISE,ONE DEFFECTIVE DISC WAS FAULTY.I THEREFORE CANNOT BAG NOR PRAISE THE DVDS.HAVE RETURNED SAME FOR CREDIT,BUT I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE SET REPLACED.IS IT TOO LATE FOR THIS??"
2,I was disappointed with the intensity of the workout.,I've been using the first abs of steel video for several years (3/4 times per week) and I still feel tired towards the end of the session. This video was a piece of cake (not good) and I didn't like how the video was done...watching Tami on a TV inside of a TV....very distracting! I'm disappointed
3,seems to be not enough exercise!,"I wish someone could actually make a workout tape that has a full upper body workout.People seem to forget that ""upper body"" is the shoulders, arms, upper back, and chest.And unluckily this tape doesn't do it either.Like it says on the title ""Arms"" and ""abs"" only.there are 3 workouts, and each is 15mins long, but take away the warm up and cool down and its only 9-10mins of actual exercises, which for arms AND abs isn't really enough to make a difference."
2,Quick-Toning Series is Too Quick!!,"I love Tamilee Webb videos. I own many. But I do not like any in the Quick Toning Series. She only gives you 15-minute of workout time, and she wastes most of it with warm-up and stretching. To really firm these area, I like the 40-minute tapes. Quick toning is too quick and not enough toning!"
3,Sturdy frame and good value but seat is very flimsy.,"The frame of this commode is very sturdy and the height is adjustable. The bucket can be removed and it includes a splash shield so you can place it over your existing toilet. The toilet seat is very flimsy and buckles underneath you. It does this regardless of whether the bucket is installed. I sat on it to try it out and it felt like I was going to fall through. I weigh 170 lb. and this claims to be rated for 300 lb. I could not imagine a 300 lb. person sitting on it. The frame would hold up for sure but the seat would probably fall through the frame. That said, I would buy again because I was looking for something relatively inexpensive for when my 95 lb. mother comes over. She hasn't complained about it. If they put a better seat on this it would be 5 stars."
2,LOOKS can be deceiving,"Here is the deal with this toilet. If you are looking for a traditional toilet in white, DONT buy this one. The rim is institutional green. The lid is a dark grey. Wish that information was written in the description before I bought it."
3,A bit disappointed,"I got this for my elderly Mom. When it arrived the seat was completely broken in 2. I did get another seat ,although it took about 3 weeks to arrive! Frame itself was wobbly and not level.It is being used over toilet so is alright,but would not recommend using alone with pot. Seat is very flimsy!"
5,Great album!,"Love this! Just good ol music with funk, jazz, r 'n b, afro-cuban. It's like a gumbo pot of music. Strong lyrics. Buy this album!"
5,GSH - You will be missed. R.I.P.,"The first time I ever heard of Gil Scott-Heron was this album while stationed in Germany. I loved every song on it and I've been a fan ever since. His music was great, the lyrics made you think, and we (soldiers) had some really great times listening to it after work in the barracks. I was thrilled to find it again in CD format."
5,Bridges,"Great CD, brings back memories, I believe it's Gill Scott Heron's best album my favorite of all. If only today's rap artist had talent."
5,YES!!!,"This review is solely for the purposes of Thanking those responsible for making this acquisition possible...gotta go, I'm getting a little misty..."
5,One...GREAT...song!,"I am just writing to say that ""Let U go"" is a wonderful song. I am glad to see that Ashley Angel is back into the music scene and doing well by getting a record label once again. The show, There and Back actually got me knowing about him being back into the scene. Ps. Lyric, the son...is adorable! I would HIGHLY reccommend listening and buying this hit single...and watching the MTV show, There and Back if you have not already. Its a great show."
1,Clinger Bird Feeder,This bird feeder will not hold up under normal bird use. I bought this feeder in the spring of this year.......so it has had maybe 4 months of usage. The tabs that hold the bottom tray break under normal usage and therefore the birds no longer have anywhere to cling to. The quality of the clear plastic silo is not suitable for normal usage.The feeder is a good design and the birds love it but it will not last.
4,Good feeder but not grackles proof,"I have used the feeder for about a month. It seems durable and is easily filled. The supply lasts a long time since birds can't stay and feed. They must take a seed, fly to a nearby branch, feed, and then return. However, most any bird including larger grackles can access the seed. But this isn't a problem as they generally get tired of one seed at a time and go on to easier feeding areas."
1,Everything clings,"Well, it seems that grackles and red wing blackbirds cling great on this feeder. They took about 3 hours to empty the entire feeder. I think it would work if the area to grab was much smaller."
2,Disappointing feeder,"I bought this feeder to keep the more expensive clinger seed in, hoping the starlings & house sparrows couldn't get at it, but it's a failure. Clinger birds (woodpeckers, chickadees, nuthatches, titmice, etc) love this feeder, but unfortunately ALL the annoying territorial birds I was hoping to keep away (grackles, starlings, house sparrows)learned to use it too. Another disadvantage of this feeder is--unless you seal up the crack around the hanger with tape, etc. the feeder fills with water when it rains turning it into an aquarium of floating birdseed :( The only good thing about it is it's easy to clean."
5,sometimes the edge of sanity is where true greatness lies,"dont believe what some of the other reviewers are saying this is truly one of the best films to deal with the hardships of being in a world that isnt suited for you. it is one of the bleakest yet poignantly executed studies of a man who is on the ""edge"" that i have ever seen. contrary to what some viewers are saying there is resolve in the end you just have to find it. at times it will make you laugh with its subtle humor and at others you will feel empathy and sadness. it is a perfect blend of comedy and tragedy with an ending that is very sublime but ends the film on a happy note. in short i would recommend this film to anyone who can deal with a film that isnt loaded with special effects and just relys on its ambience and characters to deliver a unique and enthralling cinematic experience. viva la liberati."
1,Still Red Dwarf,"Echoing the previous reviewers annoyance,i too was delighted at the prospect of a Red Dwarf DVD,but alas,i was deceived!I somehow doubt this French film has characters such as Rimmer,The Cat,or Lister!Again,this film is called THE RED DWARF,and not Red Dwarf!!Smeg!"
3,red dwarf fans,according to reddwarf.com they will begin releasing the series in November. Plus the movie is in the works
3,Left Me Wondering,"...it does provide a fascinating often dark look at insanity on a more ""human"" scale. However, the entire movie's pace is shifted so frequently with no real resolve or storyline to it or to the scenes in which tension mounts, instead it jumps to another scene far different to the one which we previously saw, interesting yes, but after two viewings it still left me wondering what is this movie ""really"" about? Its done well, but utterly confusing as to what exactly the director was trying to get across."
3,Not as illustrated!,"I like the product, but the packaging sells too, I looked at the picture and saw a pretty bottle that I have recieved in the past, but this one was in a aluminum spray bottle, not very pretty, I will look closer next time."
1,buyer beware,admittedly MY fault for not reading the amazon description. but wouldnt YOU expect a book called the cynewulf reader to be an compilation of his poetry?! nope. BORING academic essays. if youre looking for his poetry . . . look elsewhere
4,David--You're wrong!,"As a rebuttal to David from Seattle's review as this being the WORST reggae album he has ever heard: This is NOT a reggae album. If you want reggae, check out the original Blood and Fire issue CD's from which elements were taken to produce this album. Nuff said."
1,circuit city rip-off,"the product was defective. i tried taking back to local store (on Brentwood, in St Louis) & clerks (""carrie"" & ""david"") refused to take it back, and were downright insulting (as if i were trying to ""get away"" with something). when i asked for a number to talk to a higher authority, they gave me a bogus number. ""carrie"" also refused to give their last names, as if they were planning on service so poor they operate incocnito."
1,4 CD's are not integrated,"I bought this set at a local store and since it was inexpensive I thought what the heck. Well you get what you pay for and while this has 4 CDs they aren't worth much. I assumed, wrongly I might add, that the 4 CDs with the different programs were somehow integrated. That's slap one because they aren't and while each individual title sounds nice they don't have enough meat in any one to be of much value. I got the cooking software MasterCook as part of the setup when I bought a computer 5 years ago. I had hoped this software with it's slick packaging and claims of superiority would give me something better. I have already uninstalled this waste of space. By the way did I mention the navigation didn't have a lot to offer as well."
1,waste of time & a BIG disappointment,"This book was a complete waste of time & money.I thought I might be ""missing out"" on something pertinent to the show if i didn't pick up a copy for myself. Not sure if this was a ploy to make more money for their company or WHAT...but THIS BOOK WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. There were no seriously juicy ""histories""...basically, it's all about Katie, Maddie & Carly teaming up to figure out a who-dun-it murder. They all believe their significant others (in maddie's case, it's Henry) ""could"" be the killer...but want to prove otherwise.*yawn*I agree, ""don't bother""."
3,Easy read-fun story.,"Hi - I watch As the World Turns, so this was something I wanted to get to see what the hype was about. This book is easy to read and is a fun story. If you've followed the soap for years, you'll get lots of the information that this book has to offer. Fun read too-Enjoy!"
1,"As the World Turns, including this book, have gone completely downhill!","I am 65 years old. This is the first year, since I was highschool, that I have not looked forward to watching the Soap.It is such a combination of factors. The writers seem to think that they should repeat, repeat and repeat. I fast forward through half the program each day.Most of the plots are just not interesting. I like Luke and the Snyder family....but, let's get on with it!The noise and music background drowns out much of the dialogue for the older crowd. We just do not have the hearing we used to have. Why are they doing this?I thought the book would help me understand what was going on. But, it was not even enjoyable.I am close to giving up on my Program for good, and I feel the same about the book. How old are the writers?"
1,Who Needs It?,"I didn't even bother to buy this book. After watching the episodes in which they were touting it, I discovered it was fiction. What on earth were the writers thinking, if they were thinking at all? I had hoped for a real history book of As The World Turns, which would have been worth buying. To me, and probably a lot of other ardent viewers, that would be a keepsake. If the writers were attempting to use a book as a means of pulling their sorry rear ends out of their financial woes, the real history of ATWT would have made a fortune for them."
2,Oakdale Confidential,"It was ok for a soap fan. Light reading. I read it a while ago, I can't really remember much about it."
1,Horridly written!,This book was a waste of time and not even entertaining. Writing was unintelligent. I found myself skipping paragraphs and barely finished the book!
3,From someone who has never watched ATWT . . . a decent read,"I have never seen the show As the World Turns. I actually picked this book up thinking it was based on an actual town in the midwest, and thinking that it was an expose--albeit with embellishments--about the people there. I found this a very suspenseful and enjoyable read, and I was able to finish it in one day. When I think about it, it is very soap opera-ish and reads somewhat like a romance type novel. Nevertheless, as a suspense/thriller enthusiast, I still found this enjoyable."
1,Disgusting,I just came back from OIF. This is ridiculous. I can't believe people are reading about stupid soap opera trash when our troops are in danger. I just don't get it.
1,Terrible,"This book is awful. While the author describes every irrelevant detail of the trail, he consistently gives bad directions on how to get to the trailhead! My family and I have spent far too much time in the car and not on the trail due to this misinformation.Additionally, these are pretty boring hikes; most are too short and there aren't many views offered. Any ""hike' that has a parking lot at its peak can't be worthy of a real hiking book."
4,"Hiking Georgia has many assorted trails throughout the state, not just in the mountains.",Georgia provides a wealth of various outdoor environments to explore by foot. The author presents these in a clearly definititive manner.
2,So-so,"I randomly picked out this cd off a rack because it was cheap and the cover looked alright. Since I didn't pay much for it, I am not disappointed, but it's not the best cd I own. The music is pretty good, but it is a bit repetitive and the intro's are long. My favourite song is What I Miss the Most. It flows pretty well. This is an okay cd, but if your looking for value for your money, you should probably keep looking."
5,A graphic novel anthology of classic short stories,"Graphic Classics: O. Henry is a graphic novel anthology of classic short stories by O. Henry, each of which is presented in comic book form. Each individual story is fully and distinctively illustrated in comic-style in black-and-white by a different artist, and faithfully renders the gist of O. Henry's complex characterizations. The O. Henry stories featured include The Ransom of Red Chief, The Gift of the Magi, The Caballero's Way, Roads of Destiny, The Marionettes, The Friendly Call, and The Furnished Room. Brief biographies of the many different artists round out this introduction to works of great literature, highly recommended for all ages."
3,FIne product,No huge complaints. They server their purpose well enough. They are a little stiff and sometimes make it difficult to close the tailgate but it's not a huge problem. Just an inconvenience every now and then.
3,Buzzy before Buzzy,This is a great treat. Buzzy Linhart and band at the time they were backing Fred Neil. This is one great long raga jam recorded before Buzzy became a cult star.
2,Past it's prime,"This book was written in 1994. The information is very out dated. It's a book written from a person with mainframe experience wanting to learn about client server. Some of the information is still correct, but for instance, the author claims that in 5 years (by 1999) there will be no mainframe computers and everything will be client server! Not the book for me."
1,Great idea; poor quality,"When I first purchased this, I have to admit I thought it was a great idea. I soon learned it was a great idea gone wrong. After only two uses, the spout cap cracked when I tightened it. It's not like I wrenched on it very hard either. Unfortunately I will be recycling this pan along with the used oil in it- if I don't spill half of it on the way to the dump."
1,Shouldn't be allowed to sell this,"Score for this item should be a NEGATIVE five. If you want to drain your oil into something that you then have to empty into something else IMMEDIATELY, then buy this. If you want an actual CONTAINer that HOLDS OIL - DON'T BUY THIS! Cheapest design EVER. The engineers that made this should be smacked in the face repeatedly."
1,Total Crap,Terrible Product. Like others mentioned it does not seal. Plus after a very short time of owning it the cap had disintegrated and what little goodit did in the first place is now useless. Find another oil pan as this one is not what you want
1,TERRIBLE,"DO NOT BUY THIS, IT LEAKS EVERYWHERE AND IT'S CHEAPLY MADE. DON'T BE FOOL BY THE PRICE. I GOT ONE AT WALMART AND WISH I DIDN'T"
1,Skip this one,"I bought this about a year ago and hate it. It leaks incessantly from the spout. There is excess molding everywhere on the thing, in the form of sharp edges. This has made an absolute mess in my garage. What happened Blitz? You used to be of the highest quality and engineering. The lid that comes on an Aquafina bottle seals infinitely greater than this one. I wish Nalgene made an oil drain pan."
1,Drain Cap funnel - Broke,I got to use this twice before the large screw on cap that is for draining the full container cracked and started dripping oil onto my garage floor. Not cool at all.EDIT: A cap from a Clorox bleach bottle will fit easily as a replacement cap for this if you want to try it.
1,Garbage is the only good description,"This pan is a piece of junk! I didn't even get one oil change out of it before it started leaking. This is my third one, and I for sure won't be buying another! What a joke. Avoid at all costs!"
1,JUNK-JUNK-JUNK,Steer clear! This product will just frustrate you every bit of the way. They used to make a really good model but now it isn't worth 99cents.
2,Leaks,"I've gone through at least six of these for my truck, every one of them is cheaply made and the center screw seal will always leak. I need the volume of the container, but I wish they would improve the quality so I dont have to buy a new one every year."
3,Still needs a lid,I bought this one to replace Blitz's newest design. This one should come with a removeable lid.
3,Mixed Thoughts,"A bit too tall for most modern cars, however if you use a ramp it is fine. Love the fact that as oil drains it is funneled into container. Great for 1 oil change (5+ quarts), but it isn't meant to store oil."
2,pretty awful,"I have this pan, have disliked it for some time. I find it awkward to use, leaky; and the top plug broke right away. I would advise buying something else."
1,A very leaky oil pan,"On my first use, with only 4 quarts of oil in this ""15 quart"" pan, both caps leaked with just minimal movement of the pan. The cap on the spout cannot be torked, it just slips. You could not safely transport oil in this pan, even if it was just to carry it across the garage to empty into a bigger container. DO NOT put this pan in your car with oil in it."
1,Junk,"Both the front drain cap and the top fill cap will not seal. In other words, oil will not stay in the container; Oil drain pan that will not hold oil = useless"
1,Buy anything but this oil drain pan!,"This was the worst purchase I made in a long time. The center plug pops out just a little bit so oil can drain under it. During one of my first few times using this drain pan the plug fell in to the hole, closing it off. A bunch of hot oil rushed over the edges of the pan and made a huge mess. I decided to continue using the pan but going forward I took the little plug out completely. A few oil changes later the drain plug from the car fell in to the pan, in to the pan's drain opening, and plugged it off. The exact same thing happened as before. This is the worst oil pan design ever.Another thing that is kind of annoying is that the top of the drain pan will always be oily and dirty, even after wiping it down. This makes it a nuisance for storing. The caps leak like crazy. Do yourself a favor and buy a regular old pan or something with a different design."
1,FOR COLLECTORS ONLY,"This book is a classic. The content of its 187 pages could be summed up in one sentance by Al Hubbard from the book's forward. ""Crimes are committed by people; Reflect what we have beome, Amerika."" The rest of the book need not have been written.However,if it is ever reprinted John Kerry's presidential hopes are dead."
1,Very Dissapointed,I read the reviews and decided to buy this book but I was completely dissapointed.Half of the book talks about things that are obvious to anyone with common sense.This book did not help me at all. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
2,Overvalued book,"I've just read the book twice and cannot see why it should be the best book around ( as the ad says )about speedreading and comprehension. Although it is readable and organized, Power reading is not definitively a new method for reading a book, for the very simple reason that all the tools here introduced are easily found in others books on the same argument ( I've read some ), save for the importance set on the use of vocabulary . Actually Power reading gives space to certain parts of of the reading process, but then it misses to dedicate adequate space to other important aspects as the eye movement or the note-taking ( poorly explained ). Last but not least, seen that it costs more than other books on the matter, I would suggest to try some others."
5,This is super stuff!,"I had gone through umpteen books on speed reading before laying my hands on this one. Recently, i completed the ""Norman Lewis reading and comprehension course"" 'n boy...was i disappointed. I began at 250 wpm and finished at 260.I completely lost hope that i could ever push my reading speed beyond 260 words pm. I always wondered how could people read at 800 or 1000 wpm. Was it really possible for a book or course to make a person read at this level or was it just a gimmick to sell stuff??This book has changed my whole preception of speed reading and comprehension.This book is basically a 4 week course. I've already completed 2 weeks and am cruising around 500 to 550 words per minute with super comprehension and guess what?? the best part is yet to come!"
1,Only if you are he who needs read a lot of stuff without comprehansion.,"First part of the book, pretty much tell you to skip some material while you are reading, because the fewer words you read, the less time you will spend, the faster you will be. THIS IS TOALLY nonsense. the author even told u to read one line and skip the next, and read the third line. THIS IS ridiculous.Second part told you to use finger, index card, pen....etc to help reading.....that is kinda useless.The third part teachs you how to read magazine, textbook, newspaper...etc. Still the author told you just read the one you are interesting in (even a grade 6 will know that).SO DON""T BUY IT. I feel so bad wasting my time reading it...."
3,Expectations,"This book is no game changer, but may be worth a quick read through. It brings up interesting points, but don't expect it to completely change how you read. In many parts it is repetitive to the point where you start reading the same sentences over and over again. Some of the information is insightful as to how you read, but often you find yourself getting distracted by the points it is saying and start thinking about those rather than what you are suppose to be reading."
3,"Same old, same old","After reading all the reviews, I was eager to get this book. All the blurbs suggested a new approach. This is the old Evelyn Wood system of hand scanning repackaged, where you use a crutch (finger, pencil, etc) to increase your speed. The trouble is that such a method actually slows down your progress in the long run. I wish I had known this was just another hand-scanning methodology. I'd have passed on it. I liked ""Triple Your Reading Speed"" by Wade Cutler better."
5,Very excellent book,"I took a reading speed test before reading the book and measured my reading speed at 210 words per minute. But after a few hours of reading through the book, I managed to increase my speed to 790 words per minute! And that is almost over 300%!"
2,overly cautious writing,"There wer times when I thought this book was absolutely exquisite. The writing was so true, at turns dark, funny, painful. There is alot of exposition, a lot about him drinking ""mash"" feeding the dog, ruminating about minutia that gets to be tiresome after a while. By the time you get to the heart of the matter, it's difficult to care. His daughter's death, which should be the place where we come to really understand the main character is almost glossed over. Another reviewer said it perfectly, it's as if the author was so cautious about being maudlin that it goes the other way, there's no emotion, no reason for the reader to stay engaged."
1,wish i had listened to your reader from brooklyn ny,not worth the time; felt like it was written for a bad made-for-tv movie . . .
1,Life-Less,I found the writing and characters BORING in the extreme. Page 51 was as far as I could stand.
5,Absolutely riveting,"This is one of those rare books where you have to just keep saying to yourself, ""Wow! This author can WRITE! "" Busch's command of the language is exquisite, and I thought his lead character was so wise and compassionate. I loved the way he cared so deeply about the kids on the campus he was hired to protect. The ending totally caught me by surprise-- and like the main character and his psychiatrist, I couldn't see a way through the paradox. If I had to change one thing, it would be to get rid of the professor/love affair thing. I didn't really feel it added anything to the story. I can't wait to get my hands on other things this author has written!"
5,"A search for one body and two souls in ""Girls""","Frederick Busch's ""Girls"" is one of those rare novels that deftly blends a mystery of great intrigue with a protagonist's even more compelling search for himself. Busch's story, told through a hardened Vietnam vet turned campus cop, rings true in every sense. This archetypical tough guy and his, perhaps, even tougher wife must deal with the displaced sorrow they never fully felt for their own kidnapped daughter when, a decade later, a teenage girl turns up missing in the small university town where they live. ""Girls"" offers a unique journey into the heart of a character that most writers today would try to escape without painting. ""Girls"" promises to be one of the year's best"
3,"""Girls"" is a mixed bag","While the discription of the beautiful scenery and the wonderful characterizations of some of the main characters (The Dog, Rosalie Piri, and Fanny come to mind), I was left feeling cold. There's something missing. The plot is, yes, a bit unbelieveable.One thing is made clear by this books, though. Busch can write. He writes well, and the setting is perfectly described. The weak points in this book, are, unfortunately very important ones. The plot, and the main character are rushed through.""Girls"" I would reccommend as a study in writing, not as a particularly entertaining."
4,classic Frederick Busch,This is a classic Frederick Busch novel - I thoroughly enjoyed it because I enjoy his writing style. Good story. This book is part of a series so do read them in proper order. Enjoy!
3,Good but took me a while to get through it.,"If that makes sense. I thought the first chapter was confusing, until I realized you need to re-read the first chapter after you read the last. I thought it was suspenseful and thought-provoking. Kinda bummed about Jack's relationships. And, when I was a college student, was I that rude and obnoxious?"
4,Great teaching tool,"Ever been stuck with ways of saying the right thing in the right way? Well this book helps to deliver the message for age appropriate readers. I use this book in a clinical setting and the concept of its messages reaches the young reader in a way that the ""ah ha"" moment is recognized in a fun way. I recommend this product"
4,I bought for my granddaughter,My granddaughter is 8. I thought this might be a good book to help her with all the new feelings she is dealing with. It is a cute book with good advice
4,Great Introduction Book!,I read through the book before giving to my daughter and thought it was a great comprehensive book to help her start to understand her feelings. Encompases a lot of different feelings young girls (or boys) would go through during their tween years and offers up tips on how they can deal. Great starter book for tweens!
4,Help me understanding feelings,My 10 year daughter said she really like this book and read it over and over again.
4,Pre-Teen appropriate,This was a gift for my best friends pre-teen daughter. I had purchased another book previously for her by American Girl. She loves these books and I think they will really help her as she grows up and her body and emotional needs change. I intend on purchasing more for her. They are very appropriate for a pre-teen girl.
4,The Feelings Book,I think this book will be good for my 10 year old daughter. I think it will be a good reference for her to have. The books talks about all different kinds of emotions and how to handle them. It encourages girls to talk to other adults they trust with their issues and to not hold things in.
4,Girl books,"Along with physicl changes, a young girl will be thrown into emotional changes which will be better understood if she reads this little book. Mothers love the printed work to go along with the 'little talks' that need to happen as a young lady enters her preteen years. Well written and definately speaks to young girls."
4,The Feelings Book - part of the American Girl Collection,This book arrived with a small tear on the front cover and a little worn and was rated very good condition. So I expected just a little better. I expected it to be a little worn because it was used but with no tears.
4,Book,My daughter enjoys this book but I was a little disappointed at how much writing was in the book from the previous owner.
5,Fabulous book for the teen in your life,I'm a therapist and this book is a great asset to use w/ the teens/pre-teens I see in my practice. The whole series is good in my opinion.
4,Good book,"I bought this book for my then 7y.o. daughter. She found the book a little bit too hard to understand. Feelings are abstract concepts and children do not get abstract things well. I hope she'll enjoy the book more in a year or so. Overall, the book is good."
2,Not what I expected,"Although, because it's American Girl, I expected it to be expensive, I was very disappointed with the quality of this book. It didn't even meet criteria for a good paperback book. I am using it as an ""add on"" gift for a little girl instead of an individual present. I was disappointed."
5,A tour de force! A rollicking rollercoaster ride!,"I laughed, I cried, the feel-good book of the year"
5,Sweet Book,I bought this for our 9-year-old and she loved it. It's a collection of several Christmas stories and is very old fashioned and sweet.
1,Not very good,"I bought this book for my 8 year old daughter, a devoted Louisa May Alcott fan. We did not realize we already had the ""newly discovered"" Christmas story in another volume of collected writings by Louisa published many decades ago, and also that the story in question (retitled, for some reason, by the current editor) is not one of Louisa's better efforts - a formulaic Cinderella tale. I'd advise other would-be purchasers not to ignore, as I did, the scathing BOOKLIST review to be found on this page."
2,"Mildly entertaining, but hard to enjoy thoroughly","Legion of the Lost looked like a good book to get an introduction to the French Foreign Legion and what it was about. I was very interested in the ""boot camp"" process, and it was spottily covered in the first half of the book.The second half of the book was a little monotonous and took some effort to get through.My biggest complaint is that I'm not sure if the book was proofread at all. Before I hit page 100 there were at least 4 places in the book with misspellings, or missing words. This, to me, is super-distracting, and makes me doubt the quality of a book.Overall, the book was mildly entertaining, but I was left feeling unsatisfied. I am going to try a few other books about the French Foreign Legion to see if they are any better."
2,"Farting, drinking, getting punched and getting laid","Although well-written enough to want you to turn the page for potential adventure, it never comes. Jaime talks about guy bonding via farting, drinking and getting laid while in town. The book never gets exciting to the point of combat, and that's the purpose of the French Foreign Legion. Why didn't Jaime just enlist in the US army for a tour or two or three to Iraq or Afghanistan? I'm sure he could have come back with excitement, gore and extreme physical and mental challenges to last a life time. I got the impression Jaime just joined the Legion to see if he could pass basic training, and then to write about it later. I read the first 150 pages but got bored and quit...just like Jaime."
3,Too whiny,"I bought this book mainly cause I thought that I might have something in common with Mr. salazar. Considering we have very similar youths. Also Im intrigued by the French Foreign Legion. After reading the first three chapters I came to the quick realization that we are very different. Mr. Salazar story is interesting, but he focuses too much on all the bad things that happen to him during his stint in the legion. To me it becomes obvious that this part of Mr. Salaza's life was him trying to find a meaning to his life,,,but unfortunately he is still lost at the end of his story. If he would have mentioned any good memories or anything he learned,,,then maybe I would have given this book a higher rating. This book is not worth the 12 bucks. The book on the legion by Simmon Murray is way better. If only the prices could be switched on these books. Murray's book cost 6 bucks,,,I would have paid 12 for it."
3,It feels made up,"I don't have any insight other than a gut feeling, but I think a lot of this book is fabricated or at least exaggerated. The author spends so much time describing his ""elite"" engineering degree and high paying job that I just can't help but think that he's completely full of it. That feeling early on in the reading just tainted everything else to a point where I couldn't really enjoy the book. I wish there was an afterword written by one of his FFL NCOs to put it in perspective."
2,Not much information here.,"This is a book written by a little biaotch who quit the FFL rather quickly because he couldn't handle military life. Some ok in-sight on the actual enlisting process, but that is pretty much all the author did before he quit. There are much better FFL books out there."
1,Karate teacher,I dont know if only after a year you really should write a book about anything .Americans do silly things like that . in a few months they are masters of everything. dont buy the book at least get one from someone who has got through training.
5,Time to join the American Army Salazar!,"I am a friend of Jaime's and remember when he returned to the US and I read an initial draft of this book which I immensely enjoyed. However one should probably be in that niche market of those odd fellows who enjoy Legion books and idolize Simon Murray while lambasting poor Christian Jennings. Jaime never hit either extreme, which is OK. Jaime, isn't it time to again leave corporate serfdom to finally join our Army of One and get that All-American military experience? We think you are our kind of guy! Maybe Civil Affairs would be fun so a sensitive man like you can win their hearts and minds. Recruiters are standing by..."
2,Legion of the Lost,"Skip this book and read the Naked Soldier by Tony Sloane (a much better read by a guy who didn't split when things got rough). As an ex trooper I really can't stomach somebody going over the wall when things get tough. Veterans everywhere understand the brutality, injustice, and FUBAR that goes with signing up for a hitch. I feel bad for this guy because he will never know the satisfaction of surviving all that nonsense and still completing the enlistment honorably."
3,Nothing to see here,"This book was a disappointment. Over and over again, Salazar tells us how much tedium is involved with the Foreign Legion. If transferring an event to the page in a way in which the reader experiences it, Salazar is a master writer--I was just as bored as he was. One wonders as he recounts the endless tedium, why it was an experience he thought worthy of writing a book about. He also seems to have a great attraction to the Legion he can't escape. The reason for that was lost. There must be far better books on the French Foreign Legion than this one."
3,There are much better books on the Legion!,Salazar could'nt finish what he started and appears to have written a book with the hopes of turning it into a movie. Much of what is written is not necessary to the story and serves no purpose other than to prop up Salazar's ego after he failed to serve with Honor and Fidelity. Every other book about the Legion is better reading. Buy Simon Murray's book instead.
3,a fun dumb book,"This book is an account of a well-off american in the French Foreign Legion. Its really got nothing new to say about the Legion that has not been said endlessly in other sources. But its a fun ""lite"" read. Lots of stories about getting drunk, the absurdities of military life in peacetime and the charcters that are part of a force like the Legion.Don't expect any excitment though. What you get is an account of garrison duty in the france during peacetime. About the closest there is to any action is when the author deserts the legion and he deserts fast.Salazar (the author) doesn't come across as a very likeable character in the book. But he has a casual style in writing that made me forget all the things about him that were not all that great."
1,Yuppie made a worng turn in his BMW'r,"Who would want to read a book that was suppossed to be 5 chapters but all you get when you pay for it is 1 chapter. The guy quit and ran after 1 year of service in the Legion and then had the nerve to tell everyone? If that had happened in the U.S. Army he would be in Leavenworth. This author is a coward , plain and simple, and not worthy of reading let alone purchasing."
5,Keeps Getting Better,"I met Shemekia about three years. This was before I could find her debut in the stores (I bought it from her mother). I wore out that CD and I will wear out this one. Her phrasing on ""It's My Own Tears"" is wonderful. It is a true memorial for her legendary father. I love the fact that she is branching out to more rock inspired tunes with ""2 am"" Maybe she'll finally get the airplay that she truly deserves. I love her voice and I will always be in awe."
5,Please come back,"Just saw you perform in Bergen, Norway where you brought the house down with your powerful mix of blues, rock, gospel and even something that reminded me of country music done the Etta James way. You are truly amazing, and this album shows your potensial. I write for a newspaper, as you know since I did an interview with you. The next thing I will do is to write a story on your two albums and of course send it to you as I got your adress. What I love about your albums? The sincerity you put in your songs, the spirit, the guts, the soul, the warmth, the heart. I love you. Come back soon."
2,Sophomore Jinx,"This is a good, fun, enjoyable album - just not as good as her debut. The ""duet"" with Ruth Brown is lame - the legendary Miss Brown's appearance is limited to dialog. Disc not in a jewel case, rather in a multi-panel cardboard fold-out."
4,Knows How to Work It,"I've been singing blues for at least 36 years. Sad to say, most female vocalists (of all genres) have these little, sweet, or undernourished voices. What a relief to hear a woman who has the balls to really work it. I've never been soft spoken or sung, as one big, happy black listener said with a laugh: ""Where's the 300 lb. black lady? I know that cain't be little old you!"" I only hope I can cover ""Hi Cidditity"" with justice. Congratulations to a POWERhouse - who was needed desperately on the scene. ~ From a small, but POWERFUL white blues singer & lover"
5,Masterpiece,"This one is a masterpiece. She's a very merry girl, and when I hear her, I wanna jump, and I feel very well ! Her music is very merry, and I don't know any singer, who is as merry as Shemekia Copeland. She plays some good rock-blues. And I really like such rock-blues. The guitarist plays very well. No critisizm to the guitar, this time. The drums are also fine. And the singer is just wonderful !!! If this album wouldn't be released, I still wouldn't know what "" rock-blues "" means. My favorite songs from this albums are Wild, Wild Woman, Miss Hy Cidity, It's 2 A.M., And The Other Woman. Those four songs are definetly worth five stars. I really really recommend to try this album."
1,Did not receive this item.,"It has been one month since I placed my order for this item, and I have not as yet received it. Am I ever going to get it? Nothing to review."
4,Fun Book,"Fun book. It was a little obvious that it was targeting the big screen however. OK, more than obvious. I would recommend it as a fun read though."
4,Great beginning - mediocre ending,"I found the tone and detail of the novel to be very exciting up until the last 100 pages. There were major events that were glossed over. For example, the trip to Arizona was described in great detail (like the fight in the diner), but then all of a sudden Maya and Gabriel are somehow hooked up with Hollis without any description of how that came about.The handling of Lawrence's situation was intentional, I think, but it is not clear whether Lawrence is still alive or if Boone killed him. I think that he will probably show up in the next book, but the way in which that part of the novel was handled, who knows.I understand that if John Twelve Hawks went into more detail, it would be a 500 page book, but so what? If that is what it takes to tell the story completely, then he should have take the 500 pages."
4,A Good Read,"I didn't hear any advance hype about this book; I picked it up in the bookstore simply because it seemed intriguing.It's true that this is a largely unoriginal work. Regular readers of SF and fantasy won't find much that is new here. Various elements of the story have been used in many other books.Writing skill, however, counts as least as much with me as originality, and I give this book four stars because John Twelve Hawks is an engaging writer. The book is a good read. I didn't feel, at the end of the novel, that my time had been wasted.I won't be waiting with bated breath for the rest of the series to come out, but I would certainly buy the second book if the author ever publishes it."
3,"Not amazing, but I enjoyed it","It kept me reading and I enjoyed it. Not amazing in terms of bringing anything new to the science fiction/fantasy genre, but this is definitely a good beach book."
3,Not Bad........,"Unlike other reviewers here, I'd never heard of this book until I picked it up in my local library. Always on the lookout for new science-fiction so gave it a try and found this book reasonably interesting. However I don't feel compelled to look out for the rest of the books yet to come. In fact I might not bother with them at all.Dan Simmons and Peter Hamilton are much better writers."
3,Coming soon to a theater near you?,"Well, from chapter one, this book played like a movie inside my head. I do not doubt this book will be adapted to the big screen at some point. All throughout the book, I kept comparing it to the Matrix. In fact, the action scenes played out like the Matrix..you know, with the stop-action, flying in the air, karate kicks? So, as I kept comparing it to the Matrix while reading it, when I got to the end of the book, I decided the plot was nowhere near as spectacular as the Matrix plot. There was never any 'rude awakening' in this book. Maybe it's coming in the second book. Yes, this book was good enough that I plan to read the second book, but something's lacking or rather..it follows to closely to the Matrix theme but never reaches that level of greatness."
1,Silly... alltogther silly...,"It seems like an interesting premise, but implodes in it's own logic. For paraniod fiction lovers only."
1,I wish I'd read M. Goodman's review before buying the book,"Had I read the prologue of the book and/or read and taken to heart M. Goodman's review prior to buying this book, I would not have wasted money on this thing. It opens with a father cleverly training his 12-year old daughter to fight by putting her in harm's way of enraged soccer fans. Oh, please! And yet there were plenty of less than sterling reviews out there which I did read. And yet I ignored them. Why? Because I stupidly keep buying science fiction hoping something even imperfect will provide some innovation, some hint of quality. Ha ha ha, I kill me. Boy was I wrong on this one. Big time. If I can save one person from wasting his or her money on this, good. Don't buy this book. And yes, I am WELL over the age of 13. That's probably my problem."
1,Yuck,"Bad writing, really stupid plotting, mediocre characters, and heavy-handed conspiracy-theory philosophy. It's all well and good for him to tell us ""OMG they're watching us!"" but he doesn't exactly present a viable alternative...I only finished because I was trapped on an airplane with nothing else to do."
1,Over hyped and underwritten,"I have yet to review a book on Amazon and I read a huge number of books. So, that may tell you something about my reaction to this book. It's basically a hackneyed version of the Highlander (movies or TV series) with a dash of scarey ""Bad Government"" chucked in to play to the DaVinci Code crowd. (Plus as I am a motorcycle rider, it seems Hawkes knows squat about bikes. You don't signal with your right hand. Sloppy editting at least.)Grab Jennifer Government by Max Barry for a conspiracy laden scifi fix. Or treat yourself to a Tim Powers book. Anything by W. Gibson, or search out some Philip K. Dick. Something, enything other than this tripe.As far as character development goes... way too many pages playing the same plot point; main characters wracked by angst over having to make tough choices... Ok, move on and DO something. Oh, wait, it's the first book of a series. Didn't know that? Now you do."
3,"Good, but not amazing","I just finished this book, and I do admit that I was entertained by it, but it was nowhere nearly as good as the Dan Brown books that some have compared it to. I have never heard of any of the hype with the author, but I don't usually buy books either. The main charachter was exciting, and the concepts brought up in the plot (about only having the illusion of freedom) were thought provoking, but not as well developed. Yes it sucked to find out that it is the first book in a series on the last page. I'll still probably read the next 2."
4,"OK, fun read, stimulating","I finished this book in essentially one sitting. I liked it because I'm technical and also despise anyone who has sought and then secured a government job in security. But then again, London got blown up today and you hope cameras caught the peasants who did this. The book covers lots of ground - James Bond, mysticism, Hardy Boys, The Matrix, 1984, Ayn Rand, pulp fiction, Kung Foo, Alice in Wonderland and I don't know, the Bible whatever. It really had me going up to but not including the part where the proverbial helpful geek goes onto the Internet and finds the secret passages into the most top secret building ever built and they make it in and whatever. And clearly, as I closed in on the what was certain to be the final page, realizing there were not nearly enough pages to bring this to closure, I got the sense this is ""to be continued"" and it is and I don't like that."
1,Dull and shallow,I feel as if reading this book was a waste of my precious time. It was shallow. The characters were boring. The secret world order predictable. I didn't even finish it because I found his writing style similar to pulling teeth.Yawn. Don't believe any hype with this one.
1,Life is too short ...,"I made it to page 182 ... barely, and not without a struggle. The writing plods along and is unremarkable, the plot is simplistic, and the characters are just not very interesting. Yes, I was also drawn to the book by the media hype. And I was intrigued about the identity of the author. Now, I could care less. No wonder he/she/they want to remain anonymous. The only thing positive about this whole experience is that I didn't buy the book. I borrowed it from the library."
1,Couldn't even finish it ....,"I NEVER stop reading a book in the middle - UNTIL NOW. I always push through to the end. And I read about 70 books a year. I only got 1/3 of the way through this one - seems like it was written for a 6th-grade reading level, if that. I got bogged down in the 6-word sentences. I need a lot more thought-provoking prose than that. I was very disappointed."
4,Highly enjoyable & timely,"I missed the hype on this book. I found it in a bookstore and bought it on impulse and I am glad; I enjoyed it tremendously. Some writing could be improved, and there are some odd (small) plot discrepancies, but overall it is exciting on many levels and the message is timely: our privacy is being invaded more and more each day. I read some of the other reviews and am amused at those who dismiss that aspect of the book. Just proves that the book might be on to something. Also, some reviews seem disdainful of the fact the fact that the author lives ""off the grid"" and still is raking in money from this book. Well, if it is true, why on earth not? He is not breaking any laws, so more power to him."
3,"Oliver Stone would love this book, and so would Fox Mulder","This is a book that deals with what I suppose John Twelve Hawks believes to be the ""real world"". Basically, the story says that there is a cabal of men (and women too, I suppose, though Twelve Hawks doesn't mention any) who really rule the world, and they are opposed by people who are born with the potential to travel between universes - travelers, they're called - who by their very nature have the ability to effect changes in world affairs.Devotees of ""The X-Files"" will devour this book and its potential sequels lock, stock, and barrel. And just like that TV series, I'm sure they will find more questions than answers. But if you didn't like ""The X-Files"", or never really cared to watch it, you probably won't go for ""The Traveler""."
4,A great start to what I hope will be a great series,The Traveler is fascinating book - 1984 meets Carlos Castaneda. Are there hidden forces controlling our lives? Is there something more to the world corporeal? The Traveler combines these elements with a well written action/adventure story.I'm looking forward to the next book.
2,Dan Brown meets Carlos Castenada,"If you feel that you need yet another novel dealing with fictional modern incarnations of the Knights Templar, order this book now.I'll definitely pass on Books 2 and 3."
4,"very good and worthwhile, not great","I just read this book while on vacation. And of course, i tried to read as many reviews before i took it with me since the worst think is to have a bad book while on the beach.It's a sci-fi thriller and very captivating. Frankly, similar in almost too many ways to Arnold Schwartzeneggar's (pardon the misspelling) Total Recall movie over a decade ago. Became a bit slow in the mid 1/3, but still a fun page turner. It's the first of a series, and will very likely read the next book when its out."
2,Misleading advertising,"The content of the book is pretty good, and gripping BUT! - 20 pages from its 480 page length, I'm thinking that there are an awful lot of loose ends to tie up, then at the bottom of the last page, is written ""End of Part I of the Fourth Realm."" This is really a disgusting rip-off. Nowhere on the cover of the book, the description on the back, or advertising for it, was there any mention that this was Part I of a trilogy. Part II is not even published in hardback yet. The book is described as a novel. Sorry folks, a novel has a beginning a middle and an END. If it's just the first third of a story, it should say so."
2,"Almost a 3, but not quite","The author, with that foolish pure marketing name, knows how to write. He is very mechanically sound with his grammar and follows all the good writing checklists. However, he isn't a pure writer, as he has no real art in the writing. He is technically sound, but fails to make you like any of the characters. He also fails to bring any type suspense or mystery/thrill to the story. You basically know 90% of the info on the Brethern and the Travelers by the 2nd or 3rd chapter...no mystery in the book.The book is ok, but if you have something else you have been wanting to read put it ahead of The Traveler."
1,I hope you didn't buy this in a traditional bookstore,"While browsing at lunch in a tradtional walled bookstore, I picked this up. The back of the book made it sound like something just up my alley.Imagine my surprise when I pick it up and start reading about Harelquins, Travelers, the Tabula, Citizens, Drones and The Vast Machine. See, this wouldn't be a problem if the author had decided to give even a small explanation about this world. Instead, he jumps in headfirst and at the expense of character development uses Harlequin, I swear, at least once in every paragraph. If I understood whether these things were groups, races, organizations, mutations of some sort...anything would have been helpful.At about page 75 I thought I was going to gauge my eyes out. Not one word on the back of the book indicated any of this. Note to the publisher and the author - browsing shouldn't be this much of a crapshoot.I just cannot get over my disappointment."
3,Middle of the Road...,"Hmmm...where to begin. Enjoyable book. Not great, not bad, just an average, nicely paced read. (Is it just me or did you catch the editing error on page 313 too? The author writing Michael when he meant to write Gabriel.) I guess I just had a problem buying in to the ""greatness"" of a Traveler. Ok, they can go to other Realms, great, but how does that help the non Travelers? Anyway, I will read the next two installments of this series..."
2,"Fun, fast read but let's not get carried away","I picked this book up without knowing any of the hype (other than the back cover blurbs). I can't say I was impressed. It was a quick read and a bit of fun but come on people, there wasn't an original idea in the whole book: it was a committee drafted mish mash of a dozen cyberpunk and conspiracy thriller potboilers. Not a lot of internal logic either. The Harlequins claim to be a secret society of master fighters living off the grid yet they kind of spend their time jumping up and down screaming: ""Look at me guys, I'm dark and mysterious and deadly, my mom said so.""Oh yeah, whoever wrote this didn't spend much time in Los Angeles and sure as hell never owned a motorcycle much less a Moto Guzzi."
2,Trying to talk myself into reading more,"I've reached page 26 and am trying to find a reason to continue on. Based on favorable reviews here I may pick it up one more time, but I do so reluctantly."
2,Silly potboiler,"This is a silly book that was written, I suspect, with the assistance of one of those How To Write A Blockbuster software programs. The characters are thin and flat. The plot amounts to a 456 page car chase. Save your money."
2,Satisfying read but........no ending!,"I feel like I wasted my time with this book. Forget that it is a pale, pale imitation of Dune. If you're stuck at home (as I was) with a lousy cold, this book will occupy you for several hours. Then, you will be roused out of your sneezy misery, because as you feverishly reach the end of the book you will discover....nothing is solved. No loose ends are wrapped up. It's a bigger cheat than afternoon soap operas. At least they know how to set up a rip-roaring cliff-hanger. This thing ends with a whimper. Read Dune, read 1984, read Brave New World, these books explore the same topics as the Traveler and they actually have endings. Don't feel up to literature, watch a rerun of Buffy the Vampire Slayer--it's much more satisfying than the Traveler!"
2,'The Invisibles' Revisited,"Unless ""John Twelve Hawks"" is really Grant Morrison, he owes Mr. Morrison a good percentage of the sales of this book. ""The Invisibles"" (a graphic novel series from the 90's) covered all this territory almost a decade ago. Although not a ''rip-off' of the series, it was definitely influenced by the 'The Invisibles' world. Mr. 'Hawks' hasn't even tried very hard to cover it. The 'Travelers' are the 'Invisibles', both secret societies that have existed for some time and are able to visit other dimensions. The protectors of the 'Travelers' are the 'Harlequins'; a group that assists the 'Invisibles' is called the 'Harlequinade'. Interdimensional beings abound; the bad guys want total control of the populace and are accomplishing it through their influence on government agencies. And so on...I'm not saying not to read the book, just be aware of its origins."
5,"Excellent Work, I can't wait for the next one.","I thought this book was excellent. I'm not the type of person who has a lot of time for reading, and yet I couldn't put this book down. I read it in 4 days. It really makes you think about today's society where we are all connected all the time. Whether we want to admit it or not, it is an eye-opener; we are all on the grid. If you like conspiracy books, I definitely recommend it."
2,*The bad script that masquerades as a book***,"I admit it...I fell for the the hype. It's been a while since I read some science fiction (too much time immersed in thesis research) and I needed to break out. This was totally the wrong book to do it with:(The first word that springs to mind is ""formulaic"" - I could see the characters being cast for the movie by page 3. The other words that spring to mind are ""repetitive"" and ""written by a marketing committee"".I'm pretty sure that the ""Vast Machine"" wrote this book and foisted it upon the dwindling reading population as proof of how easily we'll fall for anything that smacks of esoteric history. Throw in a sword (shades of the Immortals), a Buddhist concept, some physics, a Knights Templar and we'll shell out cash for it every time.Pretty much a waste of money in hard cover.Read ""The Company"" series by Kage Baker instead - way more fun and available in paperback."
2,the traveler,I thought it was silly. I only read it because I left it in my car and needed something to read when I was out with my dog. It sucked really.
3,Entertaining but familiar,"This was an entertaining read, but it reminded me of several other stories, as if rolled into one.So, not highly original, but fairly well written."
1,Avoid at all costs...,"Apparently, I have to give this book at least one star.You know, I'm surprised this book is getting so many good reviews. It is poorly written, and badly edited. The NYTimes writes that the author got seven figures, as well as a movie deal for this book. The movie I could see being good. The book... I've read better fan fiction.Some of the problems? The writer tells when he should show. The charactes are pretty stock, which is fine for the genre. But the fact of the matter is, this book needed a lot of editing, and it didn't get it. ""The Traveler"" could have been such a good book, and the editor (the guy who edited ""The Da Vinci Code"") really dropped the ball on this one.Something else that bothered me was the whole thing about the author living off the grid. If he's so dedicated to it, then why is he publishing through Random House? And getting a movie deal? If it's a gimmick, fine, but make sure the book is good. In this case, it's not."
3,Almost a great one,"My friend recommend this one to me, in the begining I was hooked for the first few hundred pages, the characters were well written, and then towards the end for me the whole things just does not hold any sense of realism. The characters begin to act like superheroes and for me that aspect detracts from the rest of the book. Overall I liked the book and will read the second novel when it comes out."
3,"Good for most, just not for me. . .","The book was well constructed, well paced and well written (+5) but just wasn't my type of story (-2) That's where I come to my rating of 3. Wasn't a big fan of the Matrix, honestly, because I didn't get it--I think it went way over my head. Same goes for The Traveler. It was just too much. I suppose I ned just a little more reality in my fiction.If you like the Matrix, you'll like The Traveler. I happened not to like either, but I'm in the minority."
3,Doesn't Live up to the hype,"Not a bad book really, just not the type of book I was expecting. The problem I had with it is that theres not much story telling. The author simply tells you things like ""He was a mean person"", or ""this person has it out for whoever."" I suppose I prefer for a little bit more than just a blunt description. Plot wise it's a pretty cool book, 1984 meets the matrix pretty much. A lot of cliches, but there are some suspenseful moments. I guess I would wait to pick it up at a library though."
3,Not as bad not as good.,"as other reviews make it out to be. A good summer read, but put your tin foil hat on. Anyone who has read much Science Fiction will quickly find out there is not much new ground in this book and can draw quite a few parallels from stories from such authors as Williams and Gibson or the Matrix movies. The ending was not the greatest, but at least the author was able to keep my interest to the end, unlike most other SF and Techno-Thrillers that I end up dumping in the trash before I get halfway through them.Worth a read and I'm looking forward to the next book."
2,Don't buy the hype,"I picked-up The Traveler hoping for a smart, fun read and was disappointed. The ""big ideas"" are obvious and poorly fleshed-out. The plot zips along but you've seen it all before -- the Matrix-style femme with deadly skills protecting The One who fights the Vast Machine. Feels like the book was written in hopes of a movie deal. Sorry to say, little felt original, and the writing is servicable but nothing special."
3,kind of dull,"For a book of this type to be absorbing, it needs to create a world in which we are anxious to know more. Here, too little was developed about the travelers --- I don't find out enough about what they do and why anyone should care to want to hear more. It doesn't seem like such a tragedy for the travelers to be exterminated, other than because their persecutors are Bad. This is a big flaw.Also, I found the constant changing of viewpoints somewhat disorienting.Add to that all of the hype, and I'd say...read it if you really need something to pass the time, but if you don't, it's not a big loss."
2,Nothing Special,"Don't believe the hype. First of all, if the author is receiving any financial income from this book, he is paying federal income tax, social security, etc. Therefore, he is most certainly on the grid. The scientific / social context of this book is actually quite close to reality, far short of what I would call visionary SF. Most of the characters are poorly developed and the plot, such as it is, is extremely weak and fails to get the reader actively engaged in the events of the book. The book does not equal the attention it has received, mostly generated by the author's inaccurate claim to live off the grid."
1,Sham! Misleading! Over hyped! ...and not all that well written,"I like to echo a previous reviewers comment about this being the first book of a series, with no indication other than on the final page. But beyond that, unlike good trilogies, like those of say Gibson, Asimov, or even Card - the first book is not resolute, not a full story arc.To add insult to injury, you have to trudge through some awful dialog and plotting just to make this discovery.Pissed me off, I gotta tell ya..."
2,"Sounds Good, But Poorly Written","Two previous reviews, ""World-class hype - ordinary book"", and ""Good Concept, Amatuerish Writing"" sum up the situation well. None of the characters are complete, and we learn nothing of the character's ""internals"". They simply move about, do things, and talk to each other while the author blandly describes their surroundings. The book reads like a screenplay (and perhaps that's what it is).There's not much I can add to those two reviews, but I wanted to add one more cautioning voice against the numerous blurbs within the book and those found here. There's a caveat: I bailed after just under two hundred pages and I suppose it's possible that this thing turns into a real marvel at some point beyond that, but I don't see how.I will say that any comparison to Neal Stephenson, however, is just ridiculous. ""Snow Crash"" eats this thing's lunch without breaking a sweat."
1,OCR mistakes abundant.,"The Kindle Edition is full of obvious OCR miss-reads.About one per page on the smallest font setting.Amazon, please do not sell things like this without checking them first."
2,Not terribly impressed,"I was rather exited by the story line, and considerably intrigued by the first chapter. However, upon further reading I found the book to be actually quite boring. I was unimpressed by the way the author tended to over-look describing the emotions and thoughts of the characters. He would tend to let the narration reveal the plot, rather than allow it to be done through interpersonal dialog. What can I say? It was just not a pleasure to read. Boring. It seems like many people have felt the same. A cheap novel."
5,Loved it!,I can't recommend this book enough. It's a quick read that leaves you holding your breath waiting for the next two to come out.
1,Highlander meets 1984,"After hearing alot of great spin about the book I bought it for some light reading on a trip. Pretty disappointing. Between the paranoid skreeds and riffs on present day technology and society and a minimal plot, I was bored halfway through it. The book would be better as an editorial versus the plot of a novel.And it's only the beginning of the series. I won't be reading any further unless I find a copy in the street."
5,Too good to be a first book!,I'm still convinced that John Twelve Hawks is a pen name...this book is way too good to be a first book. I loved The Traveler. I loved the characters and the plot was intense. I think that The Traveler is better than Dark River...with Traveler I still wanted more but it didn't end in an odd place...with Dark River I felt like the end was just chopped off and now I'm going to have to wait for another year to find out what happens next.
1,This book is boring and unoriginal.,Just read the first five chapters of this book and the last five chapters. Everything else is just repetitive filler.
2,One-dimensional,"The Traveler wants to be the Matrix, but it's five years too late and nowhere near shiny enough to pull it off.The plot might have seemed innovative in the late 90s, but at this point it's been done, and done better. The plot is fairly predictable. The characters, as another reviewer mentioned, are completely one-dimensional to the point that you don't care when they die.I think, though, that the biggest problem with The Traveler is that it seems to take itself very seriously. It is an incredibly mediocre novel that seems to sincerely believe that it is innovative and thought-provoking, and there's something inherently cringeworthy about that."
3,Could Have Been Much Better,"This entree into the genre is adequate...nothing special...parts of Matrix, Amber, mystical sword stuff. If you enjoy the genre, this has the trappings for a good trilogy. I do not fault the author as much as I do the copy editor. Too many repetitions using the same language. How many times do we have to endure Maya's dilemma as a Harlequin? The characters are resoundingly flat and this should have been addressed. During some conversations everyone has the same voice. Boone could have been a delectable character but switches over to bad guy cliche. The trilogy can be salvaged with some better writing and editing."
5,Like Stephenson's Snow Crash? Read this.,"The Traveler by John Twelve Hawks is an action-packed and thought-provoking examination of the existence of the soul. Maya wants desperately to live the simple life of a drone in the Matrix-like ""Vast Machine,"" but her heritage and training destine her for a higher calling: protecting Travelers, people who have out-of-body experiences beyond our world. Her race to find the last Travelers and save them from those who want to exploit them is an adventure reminiscent of Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, complete with samurai swords, but with spirituality instead of virtual reality as the ultimate secret weapon."
1,Look Elsewhere,"Amatuerish showing by the author, atrocious waste of time for the reader. The book repeats itself endlessly, as if the reader cannot be trusted to remember the roles of the Harelequins, Tabula/Bretheren, and Travelers that are established in the first few pages. Among the books many flaws: very little suspense, clumsy and superficial incorporation of political/religous history, laugh-out-loud character motivation (particularly Hollis and Victory from Sin Fraser), and incompetent and/or ridiculous descriptions of technologies (quantum computing, genetic engineering, surveillance systems) that have all been explored elsewhere by better authors. The ""other realms' are simply silly - especially the ""realm of the hungry ghosts"". Empty cracker boxes - eek! Be warned - the book ends, having made no narrative progress, with a plug for next installment.How does this junk get published?"
4,The Traveller - Doesn't travel enough,"Some other reviewers have compared this to the Matrix. Let me tell you, the action is nothing like the Matrix, and neither is the pace. Lots of talking, flashbacks, and description here more than action.Overall the book took a slow pace, and I found the author a bit wordy. That said, I liked the premise of the story.The backstory as to who and why and where it starts fills kind of rolled in though and not well explained. Perhaps a cheap pawn off excuse for the rest of the story.The dialogue feels stilted and the flow is a bit rough around the edges.Good points -Characters grow and change during the story.Some really likeable characters.Good descriptive detail where important.Open viewpoint on religion - bonus points for that.This is my first novel by him that I've read. I'm going to buy the 2nd book in the trilogy. Expecting the writing to only get better."
4,Hooray--more to come!,With a whetted apetite I jumped into the second book. (The second book is book one of three ).The author has cast a wide net and brought us into a fast paced and facinating world.I am ready to strap on my seatbelt and start Book two (3)!!!!!!!!
4,Mind Blowing...great action.....,"WOW...this is the first book of Hawks that I have read and I have to tell you...it is great!!!! Excellent detail, great storyline....takes you to places that you never thought that you would ever go.....cant wait to read other installements.......:)"
2,"Interesting Premise, Terrible Writing, Ultimately Dull.","The first couple of chapters of The Traveler seemed as though they were going to be a fast-paced beginning to a good thriller/sci-fi read. Instead, after about chapter five, my eyes were glazing over with the descriptions, the plot repetitiveness, and the characters. The characters are flat, dull and stereotypical. The writing is pedantic and trite. And the plot has a 'been there, read this before' feel to it.Interesting idea and obviously quite well-researched, but the author wasn't able to write well enough for me to recommend anyone read it unfortunately."
2,"Cool idea, terrible writing","The Traveler is an interesting idea very poorly done. The prose is weak and lacks punch, the dialogue is wordy and stilted, and the characters are for the most part pawns present only to do the writer's bidding. I came across this novel while shopping for another. I wouldn't say The Traveler is a complete waste of time, but the author, with his sloppy, lazy prose and weak chapter endings (that in almost every case, should have been cut earlier so as to give them more pop), certainly wastes more of the reader's time than he has any right to do. This could have been a great book in the hands of a skillful writer. Such a writer, Twelve Hawks is not. If you're just browsing, looking for something in this genre that'll knock your sox off, check out The Descent by Jeff Long. The Traveler has everything going for it except an author who can write. Too bad."
1,I want a refund,"I honestly think that the publisher or the author owes me a refund for what I paid for this book, and a little bit extra for the hours I wasted reading it. Bad prose, silly plot, lame characters. The other one-star reviews cover it very thoroughly."
5,Enjoyable Read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the read, and couldn't help imagine what a great movie it will make. Can't wait until the next books in the trilogy are published. The audio version has an interview with the author, John Twelve Hawks, whose voice is disguised to prevent identification. A little ""spooky."""
5,A Fun Yet Ambitious Summer Read,"The Traveler is a great summer read that encompasses themes like privacy and choice within a fun and fast-paced format. I was practically taken with Maya, the hero of this story because I not only envied her ass-kicking skills, but also felt for her anguish over her violent life style. Hawks not only creates a great character in Maya, but also produces the center of the book, whose development as a character is traced by the evolution of the plot. This book covers many different themes and ideas, but they are all grounded in the great development of her as a character.Great literature this is not, but it is a truly enjoyable and interesting book. The Traveler is a very fast read, and I can't wait for the next two books in the trilogy."
2,marginal at best,good concept but poor execution. i didn't even care enough about the characters to finish the book. a rarity for me
4,Thought provoking view of our world and what could be beyond,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this book, but I can say that the novel kept me on my toes and rarely took the road I expected it would. The ideas of Travelers and what they might be able to do for all of us was enough to get me thinking and worth reading the book just for that."
2,"not a bad airplane read, but not much of a story either","it's mindless, filled with enough pseudo excitement to keep you reading, but if you doze off it doesnt much matter either.there are a handful of errors which show that the editor dozed off too - like a utility truck on one page becoming a telephone truck on the very next page. i think this happened twice, many pages apart.the female lead is a tolerable replacement for Jane Whitefield, since it looks like Thomas Perry has put Jane aside for a while. I still prefer Jane.the pure factual errors are annoying - like when a a motorcyclist uses his left hand to control the bike and his right for a weapon. since bike throttles are on the right, this just doesnt work, even in his fantasy world.but hey, if you can suspend reality for almost everything else in the book, you may as well create imaginary motorcycles.i'd buy it used, and give it away when done."
3,"Should Have Been Called ""To Be Continued""","I agree with many of the reviewers that the book is an enjoyable journeyman effort. An above average read but not a classic. With that said, one thing that I didn't see in the other reviews was a mention of the terrible ending. Basically the story just stops with no attempt at a book 1 wrap up. They are just shy of having the words ""To Be Continued"" on the last page. If I had known that book 1 was basically not going to have a resolution, I would have just waited until the trilogy is finished and read them all at once.But now you know ... ;-)"
3,Now they tell me it is a Trilogy!!,"The book itself was pretty good. Like other reviewers have stated it is an amalgam of past movies and books, but pretty well stands on it own.My biggest complaint is nowhere on the dust jacket, or title pages did it say that it was the first of three books for the Fourth Realm series. None of the reviews I read mentioned this. Only on the last ppage was it rudely pointed out. I do not usually read multi-volume books. Be aware of this before picking it up."
2,Not as good as it should be,"I was disappointed by this book. The premise is interesting, the cultural-criticism angle is increasingly relevant, and the Traveler method is personally relevant. Also, the cover looks cool.It just never connects. I don't feel that the author really wants to tell the story. He appears to have trouble writing dialogue, and tries to avoid it by describing the dialogue instead, which comes across like freakin Left Behind. The characters don't seem complete, and none of them has a sense of humor, not even the free-spirit motorcycle-riding Corrigan brother.I felt somewhat cheated. The blurbs and synopsis made it sound like a much better book (maybe I should have been warned off by the prominently featured review from People Magazine) AND much better speculative books have been written, recently, and not promoted as intensely as this one."
4,A gift,"These were a gift for my god-daughter in Fort Worth, who apparently loved them. Rumor has it she wore them every day and told her mommy she's ""a fancy girl now""."
5,Pink Boots,Got this for my granddaughter who is a little diva who loves pink and horses. She put them on as soon as she opened them. She loved them. I am sure she will get alot of use out of them.
4,Cute Pink Cowgirl Boots,"I got these cowgirl boots for my 4 1/2 year old to wear with her cowgirl costume for Halloween. Besides the fact that they almost instantly got scuffed up a bit... they are very cute. She loves how ""noisy"" they are (just because they are heavier shoes), and they made her costume look adorable."
3,A myriad of topics each discussed briefly,"Excellent chapters covering morality, law, ethics, professional codes, and intellectual property rights. Provides a basic introduction to many topics that stimulate further study, research, and discussion. Discussion of social issues is limited. The weaker chapters are the modern areas of the information age such as cyberspace, the internet, email, privacy, security, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality."
5,Excellent Theological Condensation,This is one of the best books that I have read on the theology of Pope John Paul II. The book Witness To Hope by George Weigel was good but lacked the theological ideas/philosophy of this Pope. I highly recommend this book as to Catholic theology for both Catholics and Protestants.
5,Like New Condidtion,Excellent Book in Excellent condition. Cardinal Dulles is a theologian for the people. He's easy to undestand and he gets to the basic message.
3,Good but rather too mystical for most purist Trek readers,"This was a good book if you understand Eastern philosophy (If not, go back and read The Tao of Pooh). Cohen and Baber separate personality into several character types within ST and offer analyses based on these characters, with the ultimate goal being personal growth and development. NOT for light reading, but quite interesting if self-analysis-through-Trek is your ""thing""."
3,Lyrics save it for me,at first listen I though this song was Good but as time went by it feel off for me.I Like the Lyrics but the Music&there Voices didn't blend all that well for me.
2,Good Introduction,"Bhagwat Geeta means a lot to lot of us. What this edition does is introduce the Geeta in an absolutely basic level. As I understand, we don't have time to read this book's various versions available in the market. I have personally got 5 different versions of Geeta and would recommend you to read Sri Aurobindo's version. From me, this version gets just two stars... for an excellent introduction."
1,A Pathetic Translation,"Having read the original story and bieng a Hindu from birth, I would say this book is a pathetic translation of the original. Obviousely the author has not developed an understanding for the story and niether have any of the people who have reviewed this book"
5,"Far More Enlightening than ""As It Is""","Eknath Easwaran's background, and level of consciousness, makes him an ideal translator for The Bhagavad Gita (and other similar ancient texts). This English translation is far more enlightening and truthful than the more famous ""As It Is"" translation by a different author. This is one of my all-round favorite books, and I highly recommend it for all spiritual students, or for anybody who's looking at solving the problems in their life.On a side note, Easwaran's translations of The Upanishads, and the Buddha's Dhammapada, are also top notch!"
2,Not Real.,"He has clearly missed the rich and powerful nature of this great boon of life which Krsna has produced for us out of his loving compassion for us fallen souls. He has slayed the words of Krsna with his own understanding. Study this if you must, it is the beginning of your enlightenment. Read it, but do not take it for its value Absolute Truth. I have tried to live by this book, and it does not work because the author has butchered the real meaning and value of this great literature. He has destroyed the transcendental logic behind every word in this book. There are bits and pieces where they are there of the Absolute Truth, but they have been horribly misinterpreted by the author as i have repeated. I recommend reading the real thing, you get find it at EsotericTeaching.org. Hare Krsna! All glories to Srila Prabhupada!"
5,an excellent description,An awesome description on the essence of Gita and its explanation. Made simple to understand for anyone.
3,Vintage gives you less,"The Vintage edition is the same translation as the Niligri Press, except they don't give you the individual chapter introductions by Diana Morrison. These introductions--as well as Easwaran's general introduction--were the primary reason to buy Easwaran's translation. Buy the Niligri Press version, or for beautiful language with no chapter introductions find another version. A sad case of dumbing down/cost savings by Vintage."
4,Lifelong Book,"A great book with a strong translation. At first, I did not appreciate the introductions offered, however after reading the B. Gita, I have come to appreciate the introductions. Sometimes I read them after the section, so as to not gain a bias. The book itself is a wonderful story with a great message that everyone can benefit from. I intend to look for more versions of the B. Gita to expand my collection. I think it is important to read this book from a few different translators. So while I am happy with my first purchase of the B. Gita, it will not be my last, so I can not say if this is the best version out there."
5,Great Explanations,"An explanation is provided before each section in the book, adding backstory and providing context for someone unfamiliar with the culture. I found the explanations the most engaging part."
3,The translation has some good features.,"Easwaran's translation has some good features. There is a good introduction, and each chapter has an introduction. At the end is a glossary of important Sanskrit terms, and a good index. But the translation itself is sometimes faulty. It is not literal enough, sometimes it's too much a paraphrase, which sometimes changes the meaning. One important example is in 13:28, where he has ""he does not harm himself or others"". The Sanskrit text does not have ""others"" at all. It seems that Easwaran was influenced by his pacifism. The Bhagavad Gita is in reality not pacifistic."
4,A classic with so many parallels to western ideas,"I read The Bhagavad Gita many years ago as part of a religious studies course in college. Having traversed many paths since that time, the second time around held so much more depth and meaning. This is mandatory reading for anyone interested in the diversity of the world wisdom traditions. I do not feel that the narration and commentary included with this translation detract from the essence of this classic work."
4,A great handbook for weavers,"I purchased this book for my daughter who has become a world-class weaver (in my humble opinion). She requested the book as a Christmas gift, and she found it filled with historical details and handy tips. Highly recommended."
4,The Hebrew Gospel of Matthew,THis book is a mouth full. i am chewing on the english part of Matthew and a lot is more clear than the Scriptures it self. the rest of the book very detail and still studying it. Ifyou wish to know the truth and get back to the basics you need to purchaseand study this book.
5,Hebrew Gospels,"Less than a week before I Knew this existed I had prayed that surely somewhere there was a Hebrew scroll. And then finding this book seemed to me to be a miracle. When comparing this Hebrew Gospel of Matthew with others, I find that this one is closer to matching Scripture, especially the KJV, than any other sources I've seen. I love my Hebrew Gospel of Matthew!"
3,Jacobi as King -- Long Live the Queen!,"I bought this set to see Richard II for the first time in almost 30 years. I am a great fan of Derek Jacobi from ""I, Claudius"" to ""Cadfael"" and beyond, and his Hamlet is the best I have ever seen.The history plays, for this 21st century American, simply aren't as compelling as the major tragedies. Anthony Quayle makes a fine Falstaff in Henrys 1 & 2, and I haven't watched Richard III yet, suspecting that Olivier's film cannot be surpassed.Jacobi is at his bardic best as Richard II, but he is not a likable character. He is actually quite annoying -- a prissy poppinjay and fey fop. When he died, I cried, ""The King is dead, long live the Queen!"" Not that there's anything wrong with being a queenly king, of course."
5,History according to Shakespeare,"History part 2 of Shakespeare's works.Richard II to Richard III between them Henry 4,5,6 not the 7th.Well preformed (the very best) and gives one a look at English Values.Turn your system volume way up and cool. Why was it recorded soft volume?Anyway, works well and I was into the history of that time (Robin Hood)."
5,Beautiful music!!!,"The man could sing, and, Gospelmusic was his forte! This is agreat collection of his gospelsongs and they are all great."
4,Hats Off !,"I used this for my 2-year old son during Halloweenas he was the White Rabbit from Alice in Wonderland. It was a bit big for his small head, but he thought it was fun (rabbit ears do that to little kids). I would definitely use this hat again if I ever needed to be a bunny in a suit again...it does fit the role quite nicely and you don't have to worry about a headband constricting your temples. I did enjoy the size adjuster inside that you could velcro to make it smaller or larger...of course it didn't make it small enough for a two-year old, but I knew that from previous reviews before I got it. :)"
5,Driving Backwards Was Never More Fun!,"Here is a game that every member of your family can play and enjoy. Fast, humorous action starts on the first frame. Players actually feel accomplishment when their cars make it to the finish line! Make-your-own-track component lets you test your own thrill-seeking creativity. This is a really fun game!"
3,Great for old PC,"This brief track racer is mostly a test of memorization and reflex skills. The game touts 6 tracks (if i remember correctly). However, I was unable to run this in compatability mode on Windows 7."
5,Everyone Should Read This Book.........,"The radicals of the left have been leading the American People down the ""Garden Path"" for years...This book exposes all the Liberal and manipulative tactics that are used inside the beltway (Washington, D.C.) to further their own political gains, Instead of putting the people first...I have for years been under the impression that the government was established for the benefit of the People, not the politicians. The liberal Democrats were in control of the House for some 40 years and created a national debt that is astonishing. Any serious person who is interested in change should read this book and ""pass-it-around"" or buy one for a friend, ""Especially if the friend is a liberal."" In my opinion this book should be required reading in all of our institutions of learning. Let's have more from Dr. Wilcox......."
4,Good wheel for the price,"This is probably the best Ab roller you can get for this price. But, after using it for a spell, I'd say the Ab roller as a device is overrated. Stick with the classic bicycle crunch. The American Council on Exercise found this exercise produced the greatest amount of electrical activity in the abdominal region (2.5 times more than using an Ab wheel). Happy exercising!"
4,overall upper body workout,"Great tool for an overall upperbody workout. Take it slow at first, cause you will feel it the next day. I cycle, run, and lift weights almost daily. But I was only able to do 5 wheels the first day I got it, and it felt like my abs were going to rip apart. :) But after just a couple of weeks, I am up to 30 at a time. Love it. I can feel it working shoulders, abs, upper and lower back, biceps, triceps, and lats. Great complement to any workout routine. A good way to ""top-off"" after lifting weights."
4,Good Product,"The Ab Wheel is very simple to put together - just attach the wheel to the hand grips. Delivery was quick. Some instructions or use examples would've been nice. But, all-in-all it works for me. :)"
3,Ab Wheel,"This product works really well for toning up abs. However, the buyer should be aware that it's very important that they FIRST strengthen their lower back muscles for awhile before using it. I did not and my lower back was in a lot of pain for about two weeks. I have now let it rest and heal and have also been doing weight exercises to strengthen it before using the ab wheel again. Had I know what I would do to my back, I would have definitely done the back exercises first. I'm almost better though and planning on using the ab wheel again. Just as a side note, people had warned me as well that it would be hard on my lower back and I didn't take their advice..."
4,Does what I need it to,"This is a good product for the money. The wheels aren't locked in as tight as they could be, in other words, they slide back and forth as you roll out and back. This can cause them to rub against the sides of your hands, which is no big deal, just a bit annoying. But like I said, for $15 it's still a pretty good product, definitely hits your abs."
2,Not stable!,Either I'm weak and can't do an ab roll or this product is really cheap and clunky. Doesn't move in the directions I want it to.
2,"Not as good as ""Five""","I thought the CD ""Five"" was much better. Although, I'm not upset, as I only paid $4 for it."
2,I'm i the only one wich is a little frustrated here?,"Blink 182 did it, sum 41 did it, and a lot of other bands did it too, they change their style on their latest record. But DLD completly did it. I loved ""start the show"" and ""five"" , and had huge expectations to this record, but this is a totally different genre. I usally try to give bands i like a chance with their new stuff, but this isn't working for me. Songs like ""get it right"" and ""undone"" are amazingly catchy, but i don't find any of these songs catchy in the same way. Im not saying this is a bad record ( i still like the group of course), but im suggesting all of you (if you liked ""start the show"" and ""five"") to listen to this record BEFORE you by it.."
1,Do not buy this book!,"Don't make the same mistake that I did. If you are studying for the SAT II in US or World History, buy the Barron's instead, NOT Princeton Review. The Princeton Review focuses on blatantly obvious test-taking tips and leaves you totally unprepared for the SAT II. It basically tells you, ""Just don't fill in two answers for one question and you'll be fine."" The book gives a grossly inadequate review of history. For example, in the World History section it reviews the entire history of China in about ten sentences! There are NO practice questions outside of the practice tests. The practice tests do not reflect the real SAT II at all, as I found out when I took the test. Don't believe the unsubstantiated showy claims of the book publisher. If you want to succeed on the SAT II, don't waste your money or time on this awful book."
4,Have this BluRay set Zone Free??,"Hi,Im Spanish interested in this article, anyone can say if this BLURAY set Zone is only A or A/B?? Can i read on UK BLURAY player or not?Thanks!"
3,Very disappointed with amazon!,I have just received my Tsubasa Collected Memories and it does not come with the 2 ova's or even the xxxholic movieClamp Double Feature: Tsubasa Chronicle and xxxHOLiCwhich amazon has showing on the image. I am a big fan of amazon and never had any problems when buying from them. I was expecting all this when i purchased I am very disappointed with amazon for giving false discriptions with this product.
3,yawn...,"Bought this over at Frys electronics when it was on sale/mis-priced for like $30. Storyline was ok, lots of down-time though. Fell asleep a couple times. Animation quality is pretty good, the English is decent also, except for that bunny looking thing.... it was kinda annoying."
3,Misleading Description,"This set collects all 52 episodes of the Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle series, as well as its theatrical movie, The Princess in the Birdcage Kingdom. It does NOT, however, contain the two OVAs, Tsubasa Tokyo Revelations and Tsubasa Shunraiki. This is a great series, and the set itself is beautiful, but the product description says, and I quote, ""Get the entire Tsubasa Universe released so far...the Box Set contains episodes 1-52 and 2 OVA's."" Well, this is a blatant LIE. The OVAs are NOT on this set. I repeat, buyer beware, the description of this set is WRONG!"
1,Blu-ray Version A Let Down,"I'm not going to go into the plot of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle, other sites and reviewers have that covered, but here is the deal, Funimation has yet again releases another upscaled piece of garbage.This Blu-ray set has a number of issues with the video. The images are blurry, the lines are fuzzy, colors washed out, everything as a glow around it, there is noticeable gradient banding, and artifacting during many scenes. If you own the DVDs, stick with them as they are the best quality available.If you want a HD version of this anime wait for the official release from the studio, not some cheap Funimation weekend project. I ended up returning the two part sets, because I am not going to pay for this horrible mess of a release.I added a few screenshots to the images section to show how bad this release is. Make sure to look at it full size, as it naturally looks better at a smaller size. Also the screenshot was not altered in any way from the Blu-ray source."
4,So Vast the Prison,"A somewhat difficult book to read, unless one is familiar with the French post-modernist style (Derrida, Cixous) however well worth the effort. This is an ambitious book that explores the power-relationships between men and women, husbands and wives, colonists and colonized, French and Arabs, Arabs and Berbers as well as the power implicit within spoken and written language, using a poetic, somewhat cinematic style (Djebar is also a film-maker)that meanders between what is apparently a semi-autobiographical narrative and (somewhat)straightforward historical writing, focusing on both modern and ancient Algeria.This is not a book that one can skim through and still understand: however the end result is insightful and haunting and leaves one wishing for more."
2,A bit suffocating,"I have mixed feelings about So Vast the Prison. Some of it is speedy, compelling reading and some is obfuscating malarkey. I find it difficult to decipher exactly what her objective is and I was never convinced that she herself knew. As someone interested in the varied culture of the Middle East, I did not regret the few hours I spent reading it, but I'm sure there is much better material out there."
2,"Great HD picture, Poor Analog/Digital picture, Poor Amazon service","This TV looks great on all of the high definition channels. However, it will give you a headache watching all of the other channels. I decided to return the TV after 1 week of having it, and found out that Amazon will not accept returns on TV's under any condition when larger than 27 in. Sony will not make good on the return either. Read the Amazon fine print carefully, and make sure you look at this TV on an Analog and/or Digital channel (the vast majority of cable channels) in the store prior to commiting to its purchase. I'm stuck!"
4,"Great Experience, Good TV. Very happy","Tv arrived within 5 business days of shipping. DLS unpacked and checked operation. No problems. Outstanding picture in High Def mode and good with my DVD player. However, be aware that analog channels don't upconvert very well and aren't so good. I was aware of this based on a review i had seen prior to purchase. LCD viewing angle is great. I'm very happy with the whole purchase experience and am pleased with the Product performance."
2,Could not relate,"I bought the audio book and I didn't like the way the woman read the material. Her voice was sappy and affected which was a real turn off for me. I felt the examples used in the book didn't quite capture a wide enough variety of woman. I actually came away feeling worse about ""midlife crisis"" which was not my purpose in purchasing the book. It was typical of the material out there already. Nothing fresh or new. For example, ""the gardener"" was one of the categories of women in mid-life crisis. Cut me a break! That is the old stereotype of a middle aged woman. There weren't enough modern references."
2,Get to the point,"Mr. King introduces several chapters in this book with apologies, along the lines of, ""I hate to do this to you, but now I'm going to explain ..."" or ""I normally hate definitions of fantasy, but here's mine...."" If you think it's boring and dull, why are you boring us with it?There are some good nuggets of insight here, as you would expect from someone who's generally regarded as a talented writer of popular fiction. On the other hand, it's all pretty disorganized and rambling (as others have pointed out), with an odd and undue emphasis on fantasy/sci-fi movies and books."
2,Pseudo-essay.,"As a memoir this may be worth something, since the best parts are all the reminiscences, at least as far as I'm concerned. As an essay it amounts to nothing: obvious, long-winded, dated, simplistic, much too subjective... Not utterly boring, but hey, stick to the novels."
4,Great Genre Study,"This book length essay on the horror genre turned out to be much more entertaining than I expected. Even when writing a nonfiction genre-study, King cannot avoid being King. His goofy sense of humor, absolute frankness, and the occasional crass comment made me feel more like I was having a beer with the guy and discussing books than sitting in a lecture hall. King fans who want to hear where he gets his inspirations from and what authors/films he has taken enjoyment from will get a lot out of this book.A word of caution however, if you hate spoilers, you WILL hate this book. King goes in depth in discussing several movies and books that he feels have had major influence upon the genre and he doesn't hold back from describing major plot points or endings. If you think that you might have the urge to read older sci-fi, fantasy, or horror and don't want to have any spoilers, this is not the book for you."
3,Danse Macabre,It was Stephen king but not what I thought the book to be. My fault but i will keep the book.
2,"Well, it was dry, but I finally finished reading it","A very dry book. I was bored out of my wits (what little I have) trying to complete this book. I finally did and not with complete dissapointment. It was a dull book at many parts, but It was also very interesting at just as many others. If you are a true hard-core horror fan who likes a more in-depth analysis of books and movies of the genre then you may be able to get through this book with some satisfaction. My only advice is don't try to swallow it all at once (I completed it in between readin 5 novels)."
4,Do Mind the Man Behind the Curtain,"Who better than the master to judge the genre? I am not much of a horror fan, but I very much enjoyed Mr. King's dissection of the narrative. He talks about what works and what doesn't in horror (movies) and why. We mostly all are suckers for a good story on the screen or page. King helps us understand what goes into a ""good""--as in scare the bejesus out of you--story from a horror writer's point of view. Even if you are not a big horror fan, like me, but like the narrative in general, it's worth the read."
1,"Great book, not a great audio book","Reading the reviews here, it appears the book and audiobook reviews are mixed together. The book is great. It's something I read almost 30 years ago, and I've always thought fondly of it. After listening to King read ""On Writing"" in the car, and having enjoyed it quite a bit, I thought finding the audiobook of Danse Macabre would be a nice follow up. King isnt the best reader, but his voice works. Mostly it works because he doesn't overact in that ""AW SHUCKS"" manner that the guy reading this audiobook does. You'll hear every question mark, every ellipsis, and it will make you want to stick sewing needles into your ears. I had to turn it off after the first 5 minutes. Which is a shame. I sure wish King had read this thing. It's autobiographical and it just would have made more sense for him to do the reading. Oh well, it wasn't that expensive."
4,A Virtual Encyclopedia,"I have always had a passing interest in the horror genre, but it seems to be all I can think about having finished this book. It is interesting in the utmost, and King has a conversational style at work here that is very engaging. Reading this is like sitting down with the author and talking about the books and films he discusses. It misses a 5-star rating only because it goes through patches where the writing gets soooo boring; I had to put it down and come back later. All in all: you will enjoy it, and it will make a fan out of you."
4,Fun read but...,"So far, one of the more entertaining reads from King, providing you know that this is not a fiction. It has some good insights who did know something about this field of work. What I like is how personal the writing is and how it make you feel like you are talking with a slightly mad excitable uncle on a camp fire at late night. I like King in his casual mode as much. And the texture and density of details, like his best works, are still here.Having said all that, there are a couple of things that should be mentioned. The book is outdated. An updated edition is seriously needed. The said casual tone sometimes bordering on sloppy, even if it's never reach the point of incoherent.It can also function as a very good guide for the genre. Again, the recommended list needs some updates, but as it is, it shall took a couple of months at least to get yourself familiar with all the works mentioned."
5,The Irish Banana Review,"Words cannot express my love for this show. Yes, it is a little on the cheeseball side of things and it is, at times, incredibly unrealistic. But if I wanted reality I wouldn't be watching TV.Season 2 starts off with a the same gusto and flair as season 1. The added bonus is that the actresses are now a year further into their roles and I feel like they are beginning to own them. The acting alone has improved ten fold. The gymnatsics sequences are as mind-boggling awesome as ever.Season 2 really starts stripping away the pretty exterior of the show and focuses on some real life issues - like Kaylee's eating disorder. Gymnast or not, a lot of young girls can relate and this storyline will resonate with them."
4,LOVE this show,"I did not expect to fall so hard for this show, but I did! I was channel-surfing one day when I stumbled across it; since then, it has haunted my thoughts, appeared in my dreams...I hope it never ends! There are so many aspects of this show that I absolutely adore, it is difficult to name just one, but basically, the actresses are fabulous, Neil Jackson as coach Sasha is impossible to take your eyes off of [in more ways than just one...sigh], the writing is stunningly emotional if at times a bit uneven. If you have daughters, you want them watching shows like this one which will empower them to engage with the world, dream big then achieve big, plus rely on their friends to guide them through the peer pressure which leads too many young women astray in their teenage years. I have yet to find a show which portrays women as accurately as this one does.Support female emowerment---buy this DVD!"
2,looks better than it works,"This shovel looked really nice when I removed it from the box. I seem to recall that it even came with a note saying that this was the best quality shovel that Cotter & Co. makes. I used it on a few small prior to giving it a real workout excavating trees. On this occasion I was surprised that the blade actually cracked even though there were no stones, just heavy clay. I am currently trying to resolve this insufficiency with the company and I do not yet know if they will stand behind their product or not."
3,Colonial Days 2nd grade,"I purchased this costume for my 2nd grade sons Colonial Day report. The quality is OK... It is very thin and the sewing is weak. It definately runs small. I have a 55lb 7 year old & bought the large because it was all that was in stock. I am so glad I did. I actually thought the waist was a leg hole at first! The hat ia awful- go ahead and order a different one. HOWEVER, that said, my son LOVES it! It serves it's purpose and for the price it is worth it."
2,Who wrote this?,"I was very disappointed with this latest from one of my favorite authors; I couldn't stand to finish it. There was so much potential at the beginning, but.... there was minimal character development, and no real sense of ""spark"" between Lady Amelia & Lucas. When the book started, you almost felt like you'd missed a chapter of background on the characters. Overall, it felt like I was reading a different author altogether!Let's hope that Ms. Jeffries is back to her old self in her next book."
2,tawdry,"I was expecting a regency romance (more romance than sex & better vocabulary than other romance genres), and instead I got a low brow historical romance. Even though it wove some history into the plot it didn't feel like it was set in that period. It was missing all the elegance I look for in a regency romance. Regency romances have long been a guilty pleasure of mine this one is down right embarrassing. It is far too cheesy sleazy."
3,About 3.5 stars,"This was my first SJ novel and I may have done myself a disservice by reading this book first out of all the author's works. It kept by interest, but I thought it was just an average plot and average romance story. Since this is part of a series, I will read at least one more to see if it suits my tastes more."
4,A Good Steamy Read,"Let's cut to the chsae--is this the most exciting, suspenseful, well-mapped-out plot ever? Not quite. The most beloved, well-crafted, intriguing hero and heroine ever? Not really. Yes, they're both likable enough, and the plot of the book is definitely interesting and entertaining. But the reason I gave it four stars is simply because it's HOT! The love scenes (of which there are many)are well-written and racy, entirely convincing and (no pun intended) satisfying. They certainly kept me turning the pages! There rest of this series is a bit better in terms of characters you really want to bring to life, but as far as romance novels go, I would not pass this one up!"
3,Not as good as I thought it would be...,"Having read several of SJ books, thought this would be as good... it was not so...Liked the story line, but felt it was lacking. Unlike Beware the Scot's Revenge which I felt was a better novel.Prefer SJ's Royal Prince series."
1,Completely Awful,"I was fully prepared to enjoy this book based on the raves the most of the ""reviewers"" gave it. I kept waiting for the enjoyment to start, but finally gave up 2/3rds of the way through. I found the book so dull, boring, shallow and non-entertaining that I do not feel I can trust what others write. It is obvious that the author spent about 4 days writing it. It was not worth the $6.99 price.Try something by Judith McNaughtSomething Wonderfulor Kathleen WoodiwissThe Wolf and the Doveinstead."
2,I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this book- and I tried!,"I won't include a synopsis, that has already been done.I just finished this book a couple of hours ago, and I didn't enjoy it at all. I found both Lucas and Amelia to be fairly unlikeable. I get really annoyed when reading romance stories that skip around from misunderstanding to small spat to angry tirade. I won't speak for anyone else's marriage, but I don't consider conflicts to be any sort of highlight of mine. It is hard to believe these two fell in love when there just seemed to be one issue after the other between them. Other than when they were in the midst of some steamy moment, there never seemed to be much happiness or love between them. Anyway- just my two cents."
2,"Skipped to End at page 158, boring","Sorry, but I just couldn't get into this book. First off I hate when the expressions used are like it is the current date in time. This was supposed to take place in 1818 but sounded like 2006! I just don't think young misses answered sarcastically with the word ""right"" when they meant the opposite. Anyhow I won't go into the plot as that's been done and much better than I could ever do. I just wish I would have read the other lesser starred review before I bought this and saved my money. As it is it's going into the give away bin.I didn't really care for the sex scenes either. He was a jerk."
2,"Not enough romance, too much sex","The only thing the heroes have in common is passion. They are suspicious of one another and are pretending to be something they are not, but they just can't keep their hands off each other. Blah. I don't buy that. And that a well-bread young lady (no matter how starved for adventures) would allow anyone to take such liberties with her is just... well, I just can't believe that. And all that loosing control and one's mind just because someone kisses her is plain and simple ridiculous. Not to mention that they miraculously 'fall in love' in just a few days. Blah."
4,If you like Frozen Bubble...,"I bought it because I had played it when I was younger. Its a fun game to have, though gets boring after a about an hour of play. Makes excellent entertainment for my younger cousins. If you like Frozen Bubble, this is a good game to have."
1,none,I only played for twenty minutes at a friends house. i recomend for people who like puzzle games. i don't like them very much so thats why we started playing zelda a much better game to me.
3,"Very Good, But...","As manager of ""The Oktoberfest Webring,"" I am always on the lookout for CD's of good Oktoberfest music. This particular two-disc set contains a great deal of such music. However, it also contains an inordinately large number of Bavarian folksongs and, oddly enough, a bunch of Gypsy tunes. If you want pure Oktoberfest music, this set is not for you. On the other hand, if you want a mixture of Oktoberfest music and other selections, none of which are unpleasant to listen to, then this is a good buy."
1,Nothing more than another local phone book,"I bought this book with the anticipation of learning all the secrets of the Hamptons. Instead, I get another local phone book--and I paid money and the local phone book is free! The so-called ""shortcuts"" (i.e. the Hamptons back roads to avoid the traffic) are roads that are now going to be crowded; and, worse, dangerous since they are roads that are much less safe than the crowded main arteries. The book has a confusing format, is clunky, too ""fat"" (it won't lay flat or stay open when I need it to!) and not very helpful."
1,Downright Offensive,"Unfortuneately, this book renders the East End vulnerable to the influx of undesirables. It offends the very core of my being that the Della Feminas have launched this kind of assault on one of the city's few retreats still left to the elite. The media buzzword ""The Hamptons"" is one used only by the kind of people we desire to keep out of our getaway. Buying this book is social suicide. GET OFF OF MY ISLAND."
2,It's for a small player,It's not full DVD size. It's for a camcorder and won't work on my full-sized DVD player. I'll get something more appropriate locally.
3,Decent but not like Heresy,This album is decent but in my opinion nothing like Heresy. Music wise it's really good but the vocals get annoying after a while. If you were or are a Paradox fan it's worth getting just to hear the band 11 years after Heresy.
5,Great Teaching Aid!,Best book I've found in nine years to teach Korean speakers conversational English! The book is clear and concise with great pictures. The only change I would make for future publications would be to add the phonetic spelling of each word using Korean characters. This would be a plus in addition to the Korean word(s) for the pictured items. I highly recommend this book for all Korean speakers that are serious about learning English.
1,Don't buy!! very disappointing,Not good movie. Disgusting ways shown by women which nobody will do to please men. Hated the movie and could not watch it for more than 5 minutes.Don't buy it.
1,outdated,No longer really relevant since it was written in '93 and so much in location of tracks has changed since then. An historical curiosity at best.
4,A collection of well written and inspiring tales.,"The Road Within contains an excellent collection of diverse essays about travel. It includes pieces by Annie Dillard, Barry Lopez, and Lyall Watson. The prose is clear and the essays are all well thought out. The book does not just tell how the authors gained spiritual insight during journeys. Taken together, the essays show how travel is essential to the process of growing up."
1,New Age BS,"The stories in this book have a distinctly new age mysticism and eastern religious lean to them. Too many Zen ""one hand clapping"" types of stories for my taste and not enough TRAVEL."
1,Where is the insight?,"This book must belong in the ""duh!"" section of the library. Taking care of relationships is a fundamental business concept. Well, actually it is a fundamental concept of life that success is brought about by relationships.Beyond this truism, the authors do not reveal anything. People know this already. For a book of this size and cost, what else do they have?"
5,What a great book!,"I just got a copy of Business Is a Contact Sport and couldn't put it down. I own a small business in the midwest, and the advice about building win win relationships was excellent. The idea of creating the position of Chief Relationship Officer to manage these ""assets"" was eye opening, i'm putting the plans in place to create it now. The person from PW must not be in business."
2,Not what I expected,"""Not Buying It: My Year Without Shopping"" started off to be a pretty good book. The farther I got into it the more political it became. What started off as a journey of tough questions and difficult decisions became the author's rant on her political opinions and her protest stories. I have to say that I was frustrated and did not finish the last third of the book. At one point she came off as hostile concerning her views versus others' opinions. This book made for a great bully pulpit."
3,"Interesting, could have been better","Interesting to see how she made it a year without spending, but there was a lot about her personal life, politics, etc that clouded the main story of the book."
2,Wouldn't bother...,"I flew through the first third of this book...when she was still having a hard time with not buying things.Then, apparently, she adjusted, because the rest of the book didn't really have much to say about the lack of buying. It was mostly about politics at that point - which I'm not interested in reading about in the least.Several hypocritical points, as other reviewers have mentioned. And by halfway through, I found I just didn't care anymore."
2,"Good concept, disappointing execution.","Her premise for writing this book was good, but I was hoping for a more in-depth discussion of the psychology of shopping, too. If you're looking for a discussion of 'why we buy', then don't buy this!"
2,Not Buying the Author's Book!,"While on a cruise, I found this book in the ship's library. It was a funny book to have since the cruise was all about making money - go to the $10 sales, buy more drinks, play the casino, etc. I thought I'd learn how to resist the endless sales pitches by reading this book and learn how to enjoy life without buying frivolous things.Then I read a few chapters. Ugh. The author comes across as a whiny, unabasedly materialistic and self-indulgent shopper who thinks ""sacrifice"" means going without (shudder!) her special skiing socks. I was hoping for some objective reportage, like ""Fast Food Nation"" with some data to back things up. Nope. The author's diary entries were so narcissistic and self-absorbed I lost interest after 20 odd pages. The only good thing about it was that it inspired me to write a book - if an author like this can get published, so can anybody."
1,Not buying this book,"The author had a BRILLIANT idea writing this book, however she couldn't accomplish and develop a chain of reasoning. She is PROLIX and way too boring. The reading has to be dragged.This is not a book, this is her personal JOURNAL, which I suppose it's much easier to write than a book.She vomits words and texts in these pages, and the reader has to SCAN through them, trying to find something worthy to read. You can spot very FEW interesting things about her experience. It's exausting, like trying to find a needle in a haystack.She couldn't organize her experiences and consequent feeling into wise words. So, if you plan to buy this book to get some advice from the author, just drop it! She won't help you at all. She is just gonna give you obvious phrases like ""I comtemplated the nirvana and longed for Zoloft"". Give me a break!!!Be wise, and NOT BUYING THIS BOOK will be the right choice. Because, buying is all about choices."
1,Not what I expected.,"I thought the author would write more about her struggles to give up spending. There was a little of that but most of it was a political diatribe. I'm so sick of ultra-liberals preaching their weird philosophies to the rest of us. This women has two homes, three cars, and at one time didn't pay a student loan because ""nobody else did"" until forced to do so because her credit rating was bad. What a hypocrite. Don't waste your time or money on this boring book."
1,All over the place,"This book started out with some promise, but quickly took a nose dive. It's all over the place. Replete with non sequiturs, tangents and other off-subject topics, it really goes nowhere. It's not a how-to. It's not funny. It doesn't teach. It simply meanders and often leaves the reader thinking, ""huh?""I have the sneaking suspicion that the sole purpose of this endeavor was to be able to write a book about it!"
4,"Good book, enjoyable read","I consider myself a conservative and a christian, yet I think this book was well written and enjoyable. If you can get past Levine's political beliefs, you'll see that she's really trying to have the reader see how her thought process went as she went on a fast from spending. She tries to direct the reader to consider his/her own buying behavior and question whether or not everything in our lives is necessary. If you see this as just liberal ranting, you're not getting the author's point. A must-read for every American who wants to rethink their part in our consumer culture"
4,"Didn't John Cheever write ""The Swimmer""?","Well, of course I know he did. And so should Ms. Levine's editor or any first-year proofreader. Actually, I am enjoying the book, but hate/love to find such a glaring oversight gone to print."
4,Intersesting concept!,So we are going to give it a try. The theory is good- you REALLY don't need all the junk. Staying out of stores is the key. The book gives you LOTS to think about!
1,I'M NOT BUYING IT!!,"Ok, I saw Ms. Levine on a major cable news network promoting her book. I was excited to get it and ""turn my life around"", however I refused to purchase a book called ""Not Buying It"" and so I reserved it from the library. Thank God! Within the first 4 pages I realized this was nothing more than a woman with a liberal agenda. She blamed George W. Bush and his ""minions"" for 9/11 and our supposed economic demise. Her language is rated R and in poor taste. I would hope that the information in this book had some redeeming value, however, I will never know since I immediatley returned it to the library. Please, Please do not ""Buy"" this book."
1,Typical liberal rant,"This is a rant by a liberal, 60's throwback who can't do anything but blame George Bush for everything. She is completely clueless in her New York effete existence. Following her own recommendations, no one should ever buy the book anyway. With two homes, three vehicles and a lifestyle in one of the most expensive cities in the country, what is she so upset about? Not being given more? What a loser."
2,Author can't see forest through the trees,The Author begins this book by bagging on people and their need to consume stating strong opinions about the waste of resources such as trees (paper). Does she not realize she was using paper to produce her publication? I think we should all heed her advise and not support the waste of trees and buying into consumerism by not buying this book! One has to dig through this to gain some useful information but it's mostly just dredge.
4,Shocked by the reviews,"I too picked this book up at the library over a year ago and hubby and I still talk about it's principles today. For me it was a fun read, it makes you look twice at the items in my shopping cart or nix urges to run errands all together. I can understand why the writer's political slant or her econonic status may be offensive to some. I found it funny how her ""spouse"" seemed to have an easier time sticking with the concept than she did even thought it was her idea to start with. It also demonstates that the healthier lower calorie foods are the ones that require more preparation."
3,An Interesting Story!,"Overall this is a very interesting story about two people who choose to spend an entire year without buying anything but the essentials. Some Republican/conservative bashing, which I didn't appreciate; and some of the choices the authors make are questionable (they have two homes and continue to remodel one during the project, meaning they buy things for that). This book shows an extreme version of simply living - I prefer to find someplace in the middle between excess and living without."
3,I'll buy SOME if it .....,"Judith Levine uses herself and her partner for a one-year experiment in anti-consumerism, attempting to go 365 days without buying stuff. One exception is food and from time to time Levine falls off the wagon in moments of weakness.Levine does not come off as an overbearing or preachy zealot. Her stripping down to anti-consumerist habits create new spaces in her life which she rediscovers. She dabbles in the Voluntary Simplicity movement but does not totally drink that Kool-Aid. She discovers what the saying tells us, that many of the best things in life are free.An interesting extended meditation on swimming against the consumerist tide."
2,Glad I Didn't Buy It,"I read this book though an inter-library loan. I looked forward to hearing the details of the challenges and revelations a year without buying non-essentials would deliver. Instead, I found myself reading about the bigger issue of consumerism along with lots of political blah, blah, blah. I did not enjoy this book. I am thrilled I didn't spend a penny to read it."
1,Three Adjectives Sum It Up,Silly.Pretentious.Superficial.Uh-oh! A fourth just came to mind.Humorless!
1,The title is very misleading,"This book was a huge disappointment. I checked it out of the library (thank goodness I didn't spend money on it) thinking I would learn about one woman's struggle to spend less and live more simply. Honestly, I learned all I needed to know about Judith's year-long ""journey"" from her 5 minute interview on Oprah. It starts off ok, but quickly descends into a rant against Republicans, the Iraq War and George W. Not that I'm a fan of George W and Co., but her views were quite boring and I found myself barely able to finish. I really felt as though I had suffered a ""bait and switch"", which use to be a favorite tactic of retailers. I guess Ms. Levine learned something from them during all those years of shopping."
1,Radio Interview contained all I needed to know,I bought this book based on a radio interview that I heard and was interested enough in the concept to purchase the book. The book starts off interesting but about halfway thru the Author seems to have lost her direction.The second half of the book is mostly about her political views and she spends quite a bit of time Bush bashing.I would of been better off just listening to the radio interview because most of what was covered in the half hour interview are the best parts of the book.I like the concept but not the book.
1,Really Don't Buy It,"If you want to read a book about a wanna be spiritual, earth loving, better than you woman who sometimes decides not to buy anything then this book is for you. If you looking for the honest tale of woman who gives up shopping for a year and the trials and tribulations that she encounters during that year, then you need to look else where."
2,Good thing I got it from the library,"Good idea, but poorly executed.The other reviewers said it pretty well, but I will add one thing: did anyone notice that she said she was a vegetarian and talked about eating meat several times through the book? I couldn't have been the only one to notice this."
4,"Terrific read, thought-provoking and timely","If you're looking for a how-to, a guide to getting over your shopping addiction, this isn't the book for you. But if you're willing to go along for the ride, with a terrific narrator and an interesting and timely premise, you'll definitely enjoy! Knowing NYC and Vermont made this a more fun read, but what I value most about the book is how it got me thinking hard about what a ""need"" is vs. a ""want""--and what I liked most of all about this author is her stance that those definitions, in a way, are up to you.(I also loved the parts about Rev. Billy, having met him when the Martha's Vineyard Film Society brought his movie ""What Would Jesus Buy?"" to my area. Don't get to read much about this wonderful, out-there man, who's been talking about the corrupting effects of rampant consumerism for a long, long time.)I'll definitely be watching for Judith Levine's future books!"
4,Fun to read about,Levine and her partner decided to buy only essential items for a year. Fun to read about.Could I do it? Mmmm.
1,Boring Tale,"I really wanted to like this book, but sadly it couldn't be done. I picked this up at my library before buying it at the store and boy am I glad I saved the money! I thought this book was going to tell a story about a couple who wants to change their life for the better, the painstaking process of going without extras, and something a little humorous. They did want to pay down debt, which they did, but this book was anything but humorous. It was very hard to keep my attention and it took about a week to finish it because it was too boring."
1,Not getting it,"As other reviews have stated this was a very political book. I did not learn anything from it, or even get entertainment out of it. I just didn't enjoy listening to her political thoughts while she and her husband used up their surplus in their two homes."
2,A Diary Written for Public Consumption,"Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like 'Not Buying It', and ended up hating it out of disappointment. The book is structured like a journal, with dated entries, but like a journal it is very personal to the writer. Without a strong structure the book becomes overwhelmed in trivial details and half-finished thoughts even before page 50.'Not Buying It' ought to have been a fantastic commentary on contemporary culture, but instead it is public navel-gazing."
1,"Nothing but Bashing Americans, Bush Administration, & Republicans","I'd like to know what on earth the war in Iraq has to do with not shopping for a year? This book has little to do with not buying things, but everything to do with the author's left leaning liberal views. Most of the book is spent bashing Americans and blaming the Bush Administration and Republicans for all the world's ills. I wish there had been a zero rating for this tirade of trash. Don't waste your money on this book unless you're a liberal and/or enjoy American and America bashing. If you're looking for books about downscaling or simplifying your life, I'd suggest the Simplify Your Life books by Elaine St. James; On Island Time by Hilary Stewart; or for a really refreshing look of a simple life lived well, the late Miss Oseola McCarty's book Simple Wisdom for Rich Living. **NOTE: Even though I share my last name with the current President, we are not related.**"
1,Not Buying This Book,"Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to read all of these reviews before I bought this book at a used book store.I agree with all of the reviewers that are of the opinion that the author simply decided it must be a good idea to write this book and make some money. Her real knowledge of the subject was lacking, and the effort she put into griping about the government that she was more than willing to take advantage of was disturbing (such as taking out a student loan that she had no intention of paying back).I also found it very inauthentic that she was simultaneously ""not buying it"" and remodeling one of her two homes. That just doesn't fly.I'm returning the book to the used book store without finishing it, as I just don't need to waste my time on something that not only isn't entertaining, but makes me mad."
2,Don't Buy It,"If you would like to read this book, I would recommend following its title and borrowing it from the library rather than buying it."
2,Not Buying It A Year Without Shopping,I was more interested in the essence of the idea of going without most unnecessary material wants for a year. Too much fill in with political opinions and off track non related pulled out of nowhere information. Very obvious the author needed more material to constitute a book.
1,Gave up reading it,"The inside flyleaf suggests that the author is ""panichked over the fate of her finances and that of the trash strewn earth.By page 20 we discover that she and her partner have two homes, one of which they are extending to cope with just two people's junk. Finances? Earth friendly? Rubbish book, first this century that I haven't bothered tor read to the end!"
2,Disappointed consumer,"I purchased this book and I couldn't WAIT to trade it in for credit at a local store. I found quite a bit of the book compelling but Ms. Levine's tone became almost shrill at times and I don't think she translates well outside of NYC. I mean, come on, a mini-rant about not being able to purchase the NY Times in Montana? Please. Also,I'm certainly no Bush fan but the antiBushness of this book grows old very quickly. It will date this book before its time.Ms. Levine had some wonderful insights but they were overshadowed by her ongoing political bias. I wanted a good ""chic lit"" after reading this. Too intense."
2,Great title--but really just a gimmick.,"I eagerly looked forward to this book after I saw it referred to in the Atlantic Monthly. It read like one long gimmick--that is the gimmick of not buying stuff. The writer seemed not so much as self mocking, but cynical--and though she isn't Marie Antoinette playing shepherdess, it still smacked of ""isn't it so droll, what we're doing? and won't it be great fun to write about the experiment? and even more fun if we write a best-selling book?"" I also found both the author and her husband Paul's lives to be unninteresting. They don't have children, so that may account for the insular unreality of most of the book--even though she attempts to bring realism into her many conflicts over where to budget. After the initial interest in the premise, I found it to be BORING!"
3,"Good pace, breezy read","Not life-changing (like ""Your Money or Your Life"") but a good-enough examination of the struggles of stepping outside of consumer culture. Might have been more compelling had Ms. Levine eschewed ""necessities"" like home internet service, the New York Times, her three automobiles and gourmet vegetarian sandwiches, but she made up for it with good stories about colorful characters who really *do* consume as little as possible."
1,"How about ""A Year Without Blaming Bush""?","Thank the gods I got this free from the library! This entitlement baby tries on poverty rags as a political fashion statement, rather than as a means to curb her spending and rediscover the values of thrift and simplicity. Instead of being thankful for the myriad choices that surround her, one of which is to NOT buy, she launches into an angry, joyless liberal screed. Why are these types so unhappy with life?And speaking of libraries, how can anyone who fancies herself an intellectual remain bored when there are libraries?"
1,I'm glad I didn't buy it!,"I love books that challenge my viewpoints, make me think with a fair intellectual challenge. Trust me, Not Buying It isn't one of them. The author's wrting is self-important and full of disdain for anyone who doesn't agree with her viewpoints, whether they are regarding politics or a cell phone tower. A year of self-imposed non-spending seemed to me a perfect opportunity for self-discovery but that is not what comes across in the book. Anything slighly interesting (or even remotely close to what the book jacket says the book is about) can be found in the first 3 chapters, after that settle in for a scathing worn out political diatribe that regardless of your political affections just becomes B-O-R-I-N-G. There are very few books that I can say that I hate. This ranks as one of the top on my list. I felt misled in reading it, and am grateful that I didn't waste my money on it. Don't buy it."
2,Only the opinion of the author,I was expecting this book to detail how this author got past her shopping addiction. It did not help me.
2,good ideas but NOT a gift book!,"I enjoy books about saving money and simplifying life, and this book is good on both of those subjects. I would love to give this book as a gift, but I'm afraid I can't recommend it for that. For some unknown reason, the author has included many cusswords, both in quoting other people and herself. This lowers the books quality in my opinion. Since my mother-in-law doesn't use the f word, she wouldn't have a high opinion of this book."
1,Not worth your money or your time,"If this author leans any further to the left she's going to fall over. If you don't support far left causes check this book out at the library or you will be financially supporting them. But that is not why I gave it one star... This book had little to do with ""not buying"" and was a stream of consciousness ramble vaguely related to consumerism. At first it was a look into very strange mind and it had a train wreck kind of fascination. Then I got bored... However if you really want to know how New York liberals think this is a great read for deviling into that mind. The writing itself was atrocious too, hard to believe this woman makes a living writing."
4,Thought provoking,"OK, so it's not a 'how to' book. But it is entertaining, and makes you think about your own spending habits. Libraries are good! I worked out that in the last 2 years I have borrowed around 700 books from the library. If I had actually bought these at, say, an average of $AUD30, I would have spent $AUD21,000 on books! Even at Amazon new or used prices it would still be a tidy sum saved. I confess I do buy books still, some that I got from the library first to be sure it was worth the money. I don't envy Levine's two-house three-car lifestyle and I do thank her for telling her own story from which we can take our own meaning and message. Oh, and I bought her book for $1 at an Op Shop."
4,A good exercise to try,"I went through some of the previous reviews before I wrote my own review. I liked the book. It starts the ball rolling for some of us who DO have comfortable lives, but, just don't know where to start as far as helping the environment, etc.I have reevaluated my spending habits after reading her book. I didn't mind her political statements. We all have our own views.To save money and help the environment, check out the book from your local library.I'll skip going to Target today. ( You'll know what I mean after reading the book.:)"
1,too much of her own political views,"this book was more about Bush hating than not buying anything. The title is very misleading,"
5,Singing Judith Levine praises!,"Literally, I'm not even half way through the book, though plan on curling up and finishing it tonight! I actually went to the author, Judith Levine's website to write her a persona e-mail and let her know how much I'm enjoying the diary of her and her partner's year-long experiment, and the honesty in her writing style. You feel as if you know her personally just a couple of chapters in. Being a New Yorker myself, and dealing with the daily exposure to so much culture, food, music, fashion and film, the reason most of have chosen to live in this place... I understand how hard it would be to take most all of that away for a year, and not feel terribly lost without it. I recommend to anyone in financial dilemma, or just looking for a new awareness into this consumerist America that we live in. Pick it up!"
3,Hummmm.... Is this a biased opinion?,"I would have liked this test done by someone who earns $75,000 to $100,000 and has to go to work in an office and has to deal with her peers. I don't think that someone who works at home, doesn't wear much makeup and jewelry has a lot to contend with regarding spending or not spending. The book had a lot of filler in it. Way too much information regarding this cell tower to be put up in Hartwick, who cares... that's not why we bought the book."
1,Stenoscript abc Shorthand,"This book shipped as promised. The book was in bad condition. The review indicated the book was used, but I did not thin it was as old as it was. The pages were yellow and crisp. Many were torn. The book I received did not look anything like the picture on Amazon. I would not use this seller again."
3,Good for the price,"Not much to say here. It's a pretty inexpensive rack that will suit your home studio needs. Pretty simple construction, decent durability. It's not going on the road with you and won't win any awards, but it does what I need it to do."
2,"ok, but it bunches.","Wearing this support for the first hour or so was great, but then it would ride up and bunch uncomfortably. I tried tightening and loosening it accordingly, but it didn't solve the problem."
2,Roogies Bump,I saw this movie in it's original release when I was 7 years old. Back then I thought it was a wonderful movie. After watching it again for the first time in 55 years I found it to be really a slow boring movie with very bad acting and looking like it was made on the lowest of budgets; almost unwatchable. I don't think kids of today would like it at all. The only bright spots are being able to see some of the Brooklyn Dodgers' icons from the 50's and the acting of Ruth Warrick who put out a nice performance despite an awful script. although there is a lesson here about bullying it's very hard to suffer through this horrible movie to learn it.
1,Useless junk for Apple TV owners,"This product may be OK if you are only trying to encode video for your non-widescreen iPod. However for AppleTV owners or owners of widescreen iPods, this thing is junk. The software doesn't support widescreen resolutions, the 5 times claim for encoding is only for the lowest resolution and their tech support is non-existent. Since I bought this two months ago their online tech support form has been broken. Calling gets you a message that they're not available and to call back.I will never buy another ADS Tech product again."
4,Excellent product - contains a growth hormone for plants,"This product is a 5-20-10 fertilizer (liquid), condensed (you only need 3 1/2 tablespoons per gallon), with indole-3-butyric acid, a growth hormone. I have found this to be an excellent product for rooting new trees, bushes and plants - if planting new trees/plants/bushes, please soak the product in a bucket of the mixed solution for an hour before planting.We live in the Southeast, and our red clay soil needs the help this product offers. Additionally, it is far superior to the products such as Miracle-gro's ""Quick Start Planting and Transplant Starting Solution"", which does not contain a growth hormone and which also consists of only a 4-12-4 fertilizer. (BTW, I did not buy my Root Stimulator & Starter Solution from this vendor, so I cannot speak to this vendor or price). Price seems comparable to those on a popular online auction site. Go with ""Green Light"" - recommended."
1,Entire flower bed is dead,"I put 5 flower beds in this year. I used this product in the largest of the beds. I put weeks worth of work into tilling, mixing soil, planting mulching etc. After a couple hundred in plants I followed the instruction and added this hoping that it get my plants started and they would be the show pieces I was hoping for. THEY ARE ALL DEAD!!! Only the plants in this bed are dead every other flower bed I put in using the same techniques other than this product are great. It is late October in Ohio and I have beautiful flowers that I put in this year still. Except for the bed I used this in. I would not use it again or recommend to anyone."
2,ACOUSTIC ???????,This CD does not have anything acoustic.Forgot to say who produced this CD which is to say acoustic. The first one tries to save the CD but the second disc is very bad.
4,Very pleased...,"I'm adding this review only to verify what the previous reviewer noted about the 150r. I view it as a ""bottom of the top of the line"" bike. It's solidly constructed, durable, offers the basics, and costs little for what you get. I debated about buying one of the more expensive recumbents from the Ironman line. I'm glad I didn't. This one is perfect for me."
5,Wife Loves This Bracelet,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas. It arrived in great time and my wife really loves it. It matches her other Unakite pieces very well. This is my 3rd purchase from Gem Avenue, and all purchases have been great."
3,Not as Great as Expected,"The good: Dow Theory, Major Reversal Patterns, ContinuationPatterns, Basic Concepts of a trend are problably the goodpart of this book.The bad: The section(s) on indicators and oscillators wastoo brief for any reader to learn enough to trade.I nearly wantedto put this book aside when I started reading the part onindicators and oscillators.Quite a thick book with large wordings which I desire.Have not finished yet. Being a thick book, there's bound to be something you find useful.Join discussion on Technical Analysis at http://www.amazon.com/tag/technical%20analysis/forum/ref=cm_cd_et_up_redir?%5Fencoding=UTF8&cdForum;=FxQB09HXVN3124&cdPage;=1&cdThread;=TxXFWHUP6U0IOB&newContentID;=Mx2WCANUWZXM91R#Mx28C8HVNH80MA0"
5,Review,I've read a lot of books on trading and I've never come across one better than this. It's a piece of art.
4,Excellent book and delivery,"good book, clear and thorough, amazon did a good job with the delivery too, it was sent earlier than the expected delivery date, and that is to Kuala Lumpur, MY"
2,Not for the experienced traders....,"If you've read Alexander Elders books or other good TA books, then this one has not got much to offer you.It's not easy reading either...I liked Marcel Links ""High probability trading"" much better.I'd rather go for something better maybe ""Technical analyses"" by Kirkpatrick og Dahlqust, it goes much more into the debt."
5,fantastic book,This book is a must read for the serious trader. I have read it cover to cover and re-read some chapters. It is now front and center as a reference book in my trading library. Worth every penny!!!!
5,Excellent Introductory Technical Analysis,"I bought this book after reading the reviews on Amazon and I am glad I did.What I was looking for was a good introduction to technical analysis and this book delivers. It is an easy read, it only took me 8 hours. And it is filled with plenty of graphs that are very helpful in learning the various techniques.What really helped me was having a paper money trading platform where I could practice the techniques I had just learned in the books to test out the theories. After reading this book I can now focus on the areas I believe are more relevant (moving averages, oscillators etc...)I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn the basics of technical analysis."
5,"TA's ""Must have"" Book","A ""must have"" book to those who will venture in Technical Analysis. Considered to be the ""Bible""...You cant go wrong with this one!!! an A+++"
4,good guide to reading stock charts,"This is a comprehensive guide to understanding and interpreting stock and commodity charts. It covers the subject in detail from point and figure charts to candle stick charts.Every investor should own a copy of a book on Technical Analysis, if not this one, then a comparable volume."
2,There are better overviews than this one,"If you take trading seriously you should probably invest in more specialised literature than a textbook. However, it might also be good to have a textbook on the shelf. One textbook is enough and I would recommend Kirkpatrick'sTechnical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians.The current book is good and a unique benefit for some is its large font size. However, because the book is good doesn't mean you should buy it. In the category of textbooks I personally find Kirkpatrick very good, so that is the book I would buy."
2,Extremely Shallow,"The Good: May be worth something for a beginner who wants to know what Technical Analysis is about.The Bad: No in depth view of anything.My Advice: Go to the library before buying. In one or two hours you would have read all (if anything) that is worth in this self called ""Bible"". No need to buy."
4,Great book written in plain english,"Since I can remember, I have looked at charts in investment newsletters and other places and thought ""how does he see that?"" or ""why does he say that?"". This is a great book for me because it's written in plain english and is easy to follow. He doesnt make you bleary with details - giving just enough to convey the info without wearing you out. Great reference - it sits on my desk."
4,Great Book and Worth the Read,"This is one of the most comprehensive Books I have come across in my 5 years of trading. While most PM do not buy into technical analysis schemes publicly, they most certainly do privately. I have used many of the techniques presented in this book and have been reasonably happy. The only warning I can offer is that the trader needs to understand when a persistent tend is done."
3,Technical Analysis Guidebook,"This easy reading book does a very good job of outlining well-known technical analysis techniques. Though the book should help you identify a chart pattern as it is forming, it does not give you any indication of the probability of completing its pattern."
3,nice reference book ... nothing more,"Very good compilation of decriptions on the subject. Will not give you any original idea, and unlikely any tradable idea."
4,learning to be a chartist,This is an excellent book for a non-professional online investor. It helps you orient yourself to market trends by explaining how to interpt technical charts and what the significant changes in tecnical charts means in predicting a single stock or general market trend. It is easy to understand for the non-technical investor. Was recommended to me by a stock broker and worth the cost of the text.
3,Some excitement but not very believable,"I hesitated to write this review, because I think the biggest flaw is the main character herself. Rachel Porter would have been fired and/or killed in short order in real life. No one goes against her boss like she did and still has a job. She is very unlikable to me, in that she just stomps over anyone in her single-minded pursuit to bring justice to endangered animals. However, she has no qualms about shooting the heads off snakes, and she can repeatedly pass by cougars, tigers and other wild animals living in misery and barely surviving without a qualm; not a very admirable character trait.All in all, I found the details of the investigations pretty interesting, and I learned some things too. There were also some good action scenes. If Rachel's character remains the same throughout the series though, I don't think I would read another installment."
3,"This book was entertaining, but not great.","The start of the book starts out really exciting but then loses its pep. It's entertaining, but kind of drags out. I didn't feel like I really got to know or identify with Rachel Porter's character. The book was real dry on humor. There wern't any scenes or observations that were funny. This book was ok, but not my favorite."
2,poor plotting,"If you believe that all law enforcement agents are inept or corrupt or both, then perhaps you won't have difficulty suspending disbelief for this story. The protagonist in this series blunders around crime scenes, interferes with investigations and miraculously survives single handed faceoffs with murderers. Except for the first novel in this series, don't waste time on these books."
2,Photo Album,"Items received were damaged. Items almost looked like factory seconds. Adorama did refund some of the cost, but I would much rather pay a little more and get merchandise which is in good condition."
2,Not as advertised,"I ordered a photobook that would hold small photos (roughly 2x4 inches) but received one that holds the next larger size, which is NOT what I wanted."
5,Great to improve egg quality,"I was told I had low AMH and will have a hard time conceiving. I wanted to do natural supplements before I go to an inferitily specialist. I cannot say a 100% that the supplements helped or not, but two months later I was pregnant, totally on my own. I am now at ten weeks and so happy. So,yes I would definitely give this product a try."
3,Wish I weren't allergic!,"I have read wonderful things about Royal Jelly, but after using for just two days and developing a general rash and itchiness I had to discontinue. This was with the benefit of a Benedryl, so I can't really review but wanted to warn customers that if you already have allergies, you might want to reconsider using this product."
5,Royal Jelly Great product,Glad I made this purchase. My husband says they make him feel so much better since he is started taking them.
3,This may be working,I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I seem to notice a slight overall sense of well being.The reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because I wrote to NOW asking them where the royal jelly came from and they never got back in touch with me. I have heard that a lot of bee products come from China and I wanted to make sure this one did not. I would never eat or drink ANYTHING that comes from China....just don't trust those folks!
4,the best portatil !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"tl is the best portable, of I have seen, as far as desing and performance."
4,hp tx1220,"I received my tx1220 today, it is a great laptop, i love it. I took it to Circuit City and for 39 bucks, they optimized it, removed all the junk for me. This was a good purchase."
2,Looks good.. works BAD,"I use my laptop for work so it has to cope with a very large email database and do regular word, excel and ppt.Compared to the lower spec laptop running XP that it replaced this machine is way too SLOW. I can't blame HP for Vista but I hold them responsible for letting something out of the factory with such poor performance. It never takes less than 5 seconds to open a window to create a new mail message, then another 5 seconds to open up the contact list.. another five seconds to close the window to place the message in the Outbox. Multiply that by 100 emails a day and see if you can tolerate it.The tablet is unusable for taking notes.Apart from that it is a great. Lightweight, good battery life and two batteries, good keyboard, good touchpad. All of which is no compensation for its slow operation.My recommendation: don't buy this machine .. and if you can avoid it don't bother with Vista"
2,NOT A TOUCH SCREEN,"As noted by others, this is not a touchscreen PC even though it is advertised as having that feature."
3,"Great features, poor shelf life. A fair analysis","I bought this notebook in 2008 and by the end of 2009 already had problems with the keypad and hard drive problems. Lost all my info twice. Thank God I learned to back up stuff the second time.I love the multimedia features especially the remote control and swivel screen but this thing gets sooooooo hot, you would notice I dared not even label it a laptop. I have to keep a fan on this constantly to keep it functioning without slowing down. In addition, the battery life is pretty poor, ducks out on you in about 2 hours compared to my netbook which gives 8 hours! All in all, I wished I had the touch screen but it is a good idea but no more PC for me nah, Apple all the way now...douglarmanie"
3,Lastima que el sistema de enfriamiento no sea bueno,"Lastimosamente la tarjeta madre presento daños ya que el equipo se recaliente mucho, despues de 3 años el equipo dejo de funcionar."
1,Good but a design problem will cause it to fail after 9-15 months,"I owned 2 of these series, I loved them, but they have the Nvidia GPU Graphic Processing Unit) that is defective (there is a class action case relating to it and Nvidia admitted there is a serious problem with it) to learn more Google ""Nvidia GPU problem"".The unit seriously overheats - this will cause the GPU to become disfunctional. HP refuses to admit the problem, they will ""repair""the problem during warranty, afterwards in my case with both my systems they ""repaired"" it one more time again at no charge. My tablets failed after 14 months for the first one (1220), after 9 months for the 1320, the 1320 failed again after 4 months. HP's repair seem to be a temporary patch as they do NOT resolve the problem."
1,It died after 20 months.,"Two months after the warrantee ran out, the wireless totally stopped working. Then the screen started changing resolution on its own. Then it started freezing after 15 minutes of used. I was lucky enough to get all important files out of it before it totally went dead this afternoon."
1,Avoid this at all costs,"See all the bad buzz on the web about this machine. WiFi fails, vioeo card fails and worst of all it gets really really hot such that you cannot have it on your lap. Indeed do not set it down on paper ot it will be a fire hazard. Avoid it. We have three HP laptops at work and they are all troublesome. No more HP for us!"
1,Worst notebook I ever bought,"I bought this one when it was launched. After 18 months, the motherboard failed and to replace it Geek's gave an estimate of 1100$ which is more than the new laptop's price. As soon as I bought it, the system took a while to start, so I added aditional 2GB RAM, but it hasn't improved the performance. I can't use it without a cooling pad since it generates so much heat with which you can COOK your meal..:)don't ever buy this model, one of the worst product HP ever launched."
1,Gets too hot to handle!,This would be an outstanding product except for the heat issue. I love this computer but it continues to get hotter and hotter. I am going to put it in the shop this Friday and see if there is anything a tech can do to help with the overheating. Whenever I use the HP TX1220US it sits on a fan designed for cooling laptops and I use an additional small personal fan blowing on it. Regardless it continues to overheat almost to a point its to hot to touch!If u are looking to purchase this computer my advice to you is DON'T.
1,Where is the F%^&ing touch screen?!,"got my TX1210US today, and it doesnt have a touch screen w/ this model.wrongful description! buyers beware!"
5,Best Tablet PC ever,"This is the best Notebook-Tablet PC for HP or any other brand. I carry it every time, is light and have all the functions to use in a professional way.I added wireless internet card and I'm the envy of everybody. Long battery, bright screen, easy to use keyboard, excellent touchscreen. this is the Notebook I was waring for."
1,WARNING - THIS IS NOT A TABLET PC!!!!,"I just received my new tx1210us from Amazon today and it does not have a touchscreen. As of today (July 18th)it is still advertised here (and on other sites such as CNET) as a tablet PC with an integrated touchscreen. After spending several hours trying to set up my new computer and calibrate the imaginary touchscreen, I called HP directly.The tx1210 NEVER comes equipped with a touchscreen. You have to get the tx1220 to get this functionality. I have contacted Amazon about the misadvertisement, so hopefully it will be corrected soon. In the meantime, don't fall into the same trap I did!"
1,Worked while it lasted,this laptop was great the first months that i got it but this model suffers from GPU overheats... so it last only a couple of months dont get this laptop with the nvidia gpu get another model... also this laptop is too old now
3,Get a TX2000US level Tablet,"I have had this Tablet since late August 2007. I like it! However, the Tablet features are touchscreen, ok; and Passive tablet, whereas the TX2000US models features active Digitizing by WACCOM!!! Reviews have stated that some of the other poorer features of the 1 st generation has improved also. With discounts the newer series seem to be available for as little a $1000! I paid $1400 plus $350 for All Damage Protection."
1,"Slow, too slow","This is one of the worst notebook i ever tried. A machine with 2 processors, 2GB RAM, 2,2 mhz should be much better.My old notebook with 512 Ram , 1,5 pentium M and windows XP is twice faster than this HP with the terrible Windows Vista.I am realy disapointed.weel, Sorry for my bad english"
1,Touch Screen Died Quickly,"I purchased this from Amazon about six months ago. I use my own desktop for most of my computing, which leaves this laptop for the occasional traveling use. Not having it turned on for weeks, a few days ago I was getting it ready for a trip. I was shocked to notice that the touch screen is no longer working. I contacted HP Online Support, chatting with different technicians 3 separate times. We tried installing new drivers, new BIOS, etc and finally performing a full system recovery, which caused it to lose all data and installed softwares. Now they finally admit that it is a ""hardware"" problem and told me to send it in for repair. For this touch screen feature to be so fragile and prone to failure is very disappointing and alarming to me. I wouldn't have purchased it had I known that it is so flimsy. I think HP should build more durable product."
2,Overheating problems fails this laptop,"This laptop runs extremely hot and HP refuses to recognize it's flaws. The wireless card cooks itself and stops working and the mother board overheats until it just does not work anymore. If most people get one year out of this laptop they are doing good. The cooling system is not adaquate for this laptop. It is a design flaw. Save your money and find something that runs cool and performs well for years. As a note, I have used HP desktops for years and they run great."
2,"Poor Battery Life, Hard to write on screen","I own a TX1220US for a week now and I find it useless to habdwriting recognition. Also, I'm very disapointed by the poor battery life of this notebook. You cannot even watch a whole movie on a power saver profile.Very disapointing.I also had to upgrade the BIOS since it was impossible to write on the screen. I had to push it so hard that I thought that I would break it. HP support was very nice and assertive. It solved the issue, but it's simply not productive to use it to store handwritting as text.It also feels heavier than it looks like.Be carefull"
3,It`s a good laptop but the TX1210Us is not a touchscreen,"When I bought it, the description said it has touchscreen but it hasn`t.The others feautures are wonderfull the webcam, the microphone, and fingerprint.The processor it good better than what I think."
1,BEWARE! THE LAPTOP HAS A DESIGN DEFECT!,"I purchased a HP Pavilion TX1000. Within 12.5 months the laptop completely failed. The symptoms are as follows: (1) the wireless adapter fails and is undetectable; (2) the video fails; and (3) the computer does not boot anymore.I purchased a new wireless adapter to install. It did not work. I plugged an external monitor to the video card, but it did not show an image.HP knows that their is a design defect with this laptop, specifically the nVidia chipset that they use. The laptop overheats and destroys the motherboard.DO NOT BUY HP! They have refused to acknowledge its design defect and have refused to help any of the costumers who have wasted upwards of $1200.00 USD from purchasers! In fact, I have written to the CEO's office twice and to no avail, they have refused to help me. They claim that their research group has not identified the TX1000 as a problem and refuse to recall the product or investigate out problems! They are liars, cheats and crooks!"
1,disappointed with HP,"I purchased this computer when it first came out. For functionality it was ok as the touchscreen ends up not being as useful as a powered one and ends up making the screen dull and hard to read. Also battery life was short (2hr), making dvd watching difficult, it was not as light as you would think and it got almost painfully hot at times. However, the real problem is that 15 months after purchase, the motherboard failed, in the very same way the dv2000 series does. Unfortunately, HP does not stand by this product, as they state it is not a ""known issue"" (for this series, despite having the same processor/nvidia graphic chip combo) and they offered to repair it for an additional $400, after already suggesting I have it evaluated by an authorized repair center for $70. I believe another reviewer had the same problem. I ended up having to buy another laptop because of work obligations."
2,Fraught with problems,"I have had this laptop for 8 months and have sent it back to HP twice for repairs, that is not counting the number of times(and hours) spent on phone with the HP technical helpline to have malfunctions fixed via remote access. Drivers/software suddenly stop working,or just dissappear altogether. My most major headache has been the overheating. HP replaced the fan, it was fine for about 4 weeks and the overheating started again. It gets so hot that you cannot hold the laptop! This is my 3rd laptop in 10 years and never have I had to call customer service for anything. This is my first experience with an HP product. It has not been a pleasant one!"
2,"OK for budget travelers, but not a broad-based travel book","I was hoping to find a comprehensive guide to traveling the USA. However, this book is more for a single person traveling on a tight budget. For our family, it just didn't fit. For example, we are not interested in staying in youth hostels, one of the main areas of focus in the book. So it's OK if you're single and on a tight budget, but it is NOT a good overall travel book for seeing the USA."
3,tito & tarantula,a little more mellow than tarantism....but these guys have a distinct unique sound that i enjoy. not really like anyone else.
2,"If you're looking for more Tarantism, forget it","I am sorry to say this but in comparison to Tarantism, this cd is a joke. One star for the two songs worth listening: ""Silent Train"" and ""Regresare"""
5,A fine survey of applied mechanics and its lighter side,"College-level readers who enjoy thinking about how Nature can be described using math will find Leonid Lebedev and Michael Cloud's Approximating Perfection: A Mathematician's Journey Into The World Of Mechanics, a fine survey of applied mechanics and its lighter side. Formal engineering courses often bypass such topics as how models remain imperfect and under-developed: Approximating Perfection surveys these and other issues, emphasizing underlying logic and parallels between mechanics and math."
4,He gets better and better,"Rusty's latest Cd is similar to his other two but with a more bluesy take. I have Sittin and Waiting which is fun and more of a Cailfornia swing sound. I think the best is yet to come here. Some of the songs seem a bit similar to others but it all works due to Rusty's fine vocals and guitar, and yes his vocals are getting better each time. He tells a good tale on the tune Dying on the Vine, a soulful melody. Can't sit still when he belts out She's Got Style. I think the next Cd Rusty does he will be even better than ever. Watch for this bluesman, he is gonna be big stuff!"
2,Does Elvis rock?,"Lots of good songs--however, the sound is not up to current standards. Heard better versions of almost everything."
5,As Originally Intended,"This CD kicks booty, some Blues and Rock, this is ELVIS as originally intended. While the latter sets present primarily late-1960s/early-'70s material, this appropriately lively installment features tracks recorded between 1956 and '58."
2,Interesting But,"The book is interesting but the author spends much time (many pages) explaining ""obvious things or other matters"" and not enough on UML...Anyway this book might be enough to know some on UML... and on gathering of Business Requirements.Gabriel"
4,Give this a listen,"Steve Earle's little known sister has a great voice, and makes some great music with Mark Stuart. Wonderful live; checkout this one and their other releases."
2,get the rest,"I discovered Stacey Earle in the thrift shop. Had to have everything she and Mark ever did. This is my least favorite - not as fresh. More lifeless than the early stuff. Be sure to get Stacey's first two and ""Must be Live"" with Mark."
2,Impossible to assemble and defective,"The merchandise arrived defective. So after having struggled putting the many pieces together, the seat couldn't be mounted on the bike. Shipping it back to the sender will be a nightmare because the pieces won't fit back into the box, and the box had to be pretty much demolished in order to get the main bike part out of it. The plastic casing for the handle bars was cracked also. I think that is a potential flaw in the design. A stronger material should be used there.I bought the bike because the review I read said that it was easy to assemble. That is not the case, and one needs to be very strong to lift some of the parts."
2,Not the best experience,"Item arrived damage from shipping. Carriage tube was damaged (pinched or warped)in shipment and assembled seat carriage would not slide onto the carriage tube. Unusable asas arrived. Getting it back into shipping box was a nightmare but was accomplished. Getting it shipped back to Amazon was another nightmare. They had it listed in the on line catalog weighing only 9 lbs, when in fact it weighed 141.5 lbs. UPS refused first time to pick it up due to weigh discrepancy(originally delivered by FedEx Ground), finally able to get UPS to pick it up after many phone calls and emails. This was NOT one of my best experiences with Amazon. Note that heart monitor is not in the recumbent seat handles but are in the bent forward handles. Not a deal killer for me, but might be for some."
5,Nice Quality,"I purchased this item in quanity as gifts for my neices and nephews. When I was a child, the Christmas Carols were given to us at school to take home and sing with our families. I loved that childhood memory and wanted to pass it on to the younger generation. I found the books to be full of familar songs. They do not have the sheet music, it is just the words. I dont know any children and few adults who read music anyway and depend on the parents to teach them the tunes. The books were beautiful gifts and much loved by those who recieved them."
2,christmas carols : complete verses ( dover thrift edition),"This paper book of carols had too many obscure songs in it and did not contain the musical notation that helps to start a song if you are unsure of the melody, I guess you get what you pay for and if I had known how scant the book was on substance before i purchased I would not have bought this version. I wanted more american standard versions with which I could hand out to friends at Christmas time so we could carol together. This publication did not meet my expectations"
3,"Music, please, maestro?","This is what it says: Complete *Verses*. I see now that other reviewers indicated there was no music. I should have read their reviews more closely. There are lots of songs with lots and lots of lyrics. I usually know more lyrics than everybody else (which is one of the reasons I have no friends, of course) but this had some new ones for me.Next year, I'll try to find a compendium with music."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!,Amon Amarth is doing what they do best! Making great music! This album is great start to finish!
5,One of the best metal albums I've ever heard...,"I've been a big fan of Amon Amarth for a couple years now, but this album is by far their best work yet. Every track is just amazing.The recording seems more refined and ""clean"" than their previous albums (its much easier to hear each instrument and each tone, beat and word), while the music is still extremely complex. Most importantly it sounds excellent. Every track is memorable.My favorites are Asator, Valhall Awaits Me and Runes to My Memory, but the whole CD is every bit as good.I'm not into all kinds of death metal (not really into Cannibal Corpse or Deicide or other bands like that) but this band is phenomenal. Their music is organized and complex and the vocalist can put out some of the best growls and screams in metal while still being totaly clear.I highly recommend this album to fans of any kind of metal... even if you dont normally listen to death metal, give this a try. You wont regret it."
5,PREPARING FOR RAGNAROK!,"Truly amazing & inspiring!I'm not a big AA fan but this cd blew me away.BATHORY & THERION are good also,but this is a MUST LISTEN for fans of the genre.From a cultural perspective,this definately deserves a listen to.We(German,Nordic,Celtic)need to reflect on our heritage once and a while and AA transforms & transportsus back to a time of our ancestors.I think a lot of people in our culture can't figure out what they want to be,because they don't even know who they are,what they are or where they are from!Who knows,""With Oden on Our Side""we can't go wrong!"
4,Not very fast but still good,"I have not heard their other albums but this one sounded good to me. The tempo stayed in the medium to fast range and the harmonies added a lot of depth to the album. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing too complex to be found but even simple arrangments can sound good if done right."
5,Norse Mythology Metal,"This has to be one of my all time favorite albums. Every song on here makes one want to ride into battle. And for those interested in Norse mythology, it follows the great story of Oden or Odin. Must have for Epic metal fans and viking lovers."
5,An Awesome Album from An Awesome Band,"I had never heard Amon Amarth until one song came on the tv (Cry of the Blackbirds). I bought the album and was blown away!! I did some research and found their music is based on Norse mythology and other religious beliefs. The lyrics are a bit strange because of that, but that does not take away from the awesome death metal riffs and smooth beat. It's totally deep sounding, dark, evil, and intimidating, yet intense and attractive at the same time. I listen to it and find myself head banging or moving with the rhythm. For a band I had never heard of before now, I am totally blown away by their sound, look, and total devotion to their beliefs. Awesome Band, Awesome Album."
5,With Oden on Our Side - Viking Metal Masterpiece,"AA has outdone themselves... ""With Oden on Our Side"" is one of the best releases from any metal band in a long time... Every trac has hooks that keep you comming back for another listen... best tracks are Asator (if only for the storytelling nature of the lyrics)... and Valhall Awaits Me, Runes To My Memory, Hermod's Ride To Hel-Lokes Treachery Part 1 & Gods Of War Arise. If you are into metal and you dont like this CD.... something is wrong with you!!!"
3,It's o.k.,"3.5 stars.The first track is pretty cool but the rest of the album is just o.k. I do kind of like ""Cry of the Black Birds"" as well. Neither the riff-work nor the soloing is particularly impressive. Overall, I like Amon Amarth but I don't love them. (Other bands in the genre do this better.) I'd go see them if they came to town but, even so, this isn't an album I'd recommend everyone rush out and buy.Not bad but not recommended."
2,CP saw,Blades are expensive. Blade guide that mounts to the saw does not stay secure after a few uses it is junk. Saw continues to work without the guide although it really should have something to keep the blade straight in the saw.
5,Inspirational story of a couragous person,"I found this documentary to be a very inspiring story of a man that has persevered hard times and is willing to stand up for what he believes in....the survival of his people and their history & culture. It is both a sad story and yet one of hope, that people like this Island President exist and flourish for brief times in human history. Let's hope the commitments he helped achieve in Copenhagen lead to some real actions on the part of governments to address climate change."
5,Jeff's Trees,"What a thrill to find Jeff Meyer's book at Amazon and Barnes& Noble! I had no idea he was working on one - and one so comprehensive as this. I knew he was extremely involved in the historic tree/seed program and research. There is also a very interesting documentary on this subject that Jeff appeared in and advised on, which was aired on PBS this year. His mother, Joanne, has been a strong influence on Jeff in this field. She is a tireless member of The Garden Club of America and, by her efforts, raised the conciousness of many.This book is a fine explanation of all the work that has been done to preserve history, as well as to make us more aware of how important beautiful trees are to our quality of life on this planet. The photography is marvellous and the book is a wonderful read, as well as a great coffee table book for just a quick pickup. We all love a ""picture book"", don't we?"
4,Just the Paul Rodgers sung songs make this CD worth it.,"Buy this CD!!! Great, distinctive guitar playing, and Paul Rodgers vocals are some of his best ever!"
4,Works well.,"Works so well, that my foster dog destroyed it. He does not like it on his face, but the constant outdoor barking has been drastically reduced."
3,The calming face wrap,The calming face wrap seems to give my Dachshund a little more confidence than she had before. It does not stop the barking but the barking is a litte bit less and a lot less intense.
2,Calming face wrap,The sizing chart is off a bit. Was way to big for my lil' guy so ended up returning item. Unsure of practicality of wrap but if you do decide to order think small.
1,Ineffective,"My little Maltese, Pretty, barks a lot. I thought she might bark a little less if I put it on when company was visiting, but she can bark just as much with the wrap in place. The good thing is however, that she can eat and drink with it on. Otherwise, it has no effect on her."
2,Too big,"This wrap is not made for smaller dogs.Does not fit around my dog's muzzle.For reference, my dog weighs about 15 pounds."
2,Need to define the size better,"Since my dog is around 12 lbs and is 10 months old, I decided to try SIZE 2 which didn't have a definition. My dog figured out how to claw it from her head and chew the plastic clasp. It worked okay but couldn't keep it on her head. So it looks like I will have to try a SIZE 1. Hopefully that will do the trick"
1,Save your money for a bark collar,"Did not work with ~1 year old chocolate lab (constant barking). The dog was too distracted trying to remove it, even after following manufacturer's suggestions. Basic design flaw: it cannot be secured so that the dog is unable to remove it. Save your money for an anti-barking shock collar. Ours has reduced barking down to occasional wimpers..."""
5,an excellent book,lowery stokes sims delivers justice to one of the most underrated artists of the 20th century european avant-garde. this comprehensive study of lam's career not only signifies his presence within modern art and surrealism but also within the art historical canon. a very enjoyable read of a fascinating artist.
3,Looks Good BUT .......,"The Robert E. Lee costume looked good, just like it was suppose to. The sizing was also appropriate. We knew we would have to have the pants shortened. I am/was under the impression that this costume was made/constructed in the USA. The sewingon this costume is/was NOT acceptable. Does NOT meet USA standards of worksmanship. Buttonholes coming unraveled, threads having to be knotted so they would not unravel. Costume worn twice. Washed once in washing machine and overall did wash well but also after washing, had to repair unraveled threads. The price paid was to much for the workmanship on this costume."
3,Robert E. Lee Child Costume,"I purchased this costume for my son for a school project he is involved in. The picture of the costume is great, but it is not true to what you receive. The pants were unhemmed and the jacket also. Which is a plus not to be to short! The fringe in the picture is nothing like the fringe on the costume you receive. It is very cheap looking. I had to do some improv changing the buttons, fringe, belt/sash and hem. It was worth the trouble and not having to make the whole costume from the beginning stages. Overall it is a good deal, just need to put some TLC into making it look like the picture on the package."
5,The real story,"I was at Catholic University when Fr. Curran began his career there. The trials and tribulations that he underwent for the sake of truth are incredible. Here's his story, written with humility and charity, which are traits of a great teacher. Above all, it shows his integrity and love of the truth. A very good read."
1,Arena Rock CD,This was a major disappointment. All the songs were knockoffs done by unknown groups.They certainly were not the original songs played at the arenas during games. Some of them were rather badly done. I apparently didn't read the fine print when ordering this disc.I am so sorry I wasted my money on this CD.
4,Please ignore the reader from Gold Beach...,"This is a must-read, particularly in the field of systematic Instructional Design and specifically regarding learning objectives, criterion-referenced testing, etc. Bloom's work is the foundation for countless strategies, research, models, etc.The series on all domians is a good addition to any teacher's library, regardless of content or level."
5,the best book written on the subject,"As a Chesapeake Bay native and avid log canoe sailor I found this book well-researched and amply illustrated. It is a bit dated, but no other work is as comprehensive. Model builders will find some line drawings, but HAMMS and Chapelle's ""Small Sailing Craft"" are probably better sources for that specific aspect of the working Bay craft. I would recommend this book for canoe/skipjack afficianados, modelers looking for an interesting alternative to square riggers, and marine history buffs who are not familiar with the genre. Brewington's narrative includes information that would be of interest to just about anyone interested in the Bay and its colorful history."
2,"Logical, yet lacking new ideas and impact","This book is about a critically important topic to many professionals.I basically like the structure of the book as outlined in the Introduction (pp. 7-8, hardcover edition). These points are not dramatically new, yet neatly outline three key precepts to embrace when stepping up to a higher position. And throughout the book are boxed lines of text that define terms or give tips in a usable sound-bite.Still, this is where my compliments stop for this particular book. Why? Most of the writing over-simplifies the disparity between the ""conventional"" and the ""step-up"" behavior options that it introduces, as if we are either one or the other. Vague recommendations don't get fleshed out and hints that sound more like platitudes take center stage.As a reader, I was left with the impression that these authors are seeing the real-world as a black-and-white kind of place."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!","I LOVED Lord Darver's Match. This book is utterly fantastic. I got hooked on the first page with Hillary waking up with an unknown man and couldn't stop reading. My wife and I got a kick out of that one! Simon is instantly charming and the story is smooth, compelling, and skillfully written. It's a great introduction to the Regency era, too. I've recommended Lord Darver's Match to my friends."
4,pretty darn good,"We mounted this in a work truck and it works great. It is heavy duty, easy to use, great price for the product."
2,Alternate view...,"I bought this based mainly on the previous four rave reviews. Unfortunately, not only are the arrangements here uninspired, but the title of the album is misleading-- included on the album are only very short excerpts from the Nutcracker; the rest of the album is filled with (also uninspired) Christmas music."
5,A Real Treat,"Black erotica is finding a larger audience every day and this collection of short stories will certainly enhance that trend. Unlike similar anthologies, A Chocolate Seduction is not just vignettes of couples hooking up for hot, smutty sex. Most of the stories are actually just that - a complete story with a plot, conflict, and resolution.TL Gardner reels you in with his signature, sexy vampiress, and Lena Scott makes you look at your yard man in a totally different way. T. Blackmon, Jr.'s reverse spin on the edible version of Pygmalion's Galatea will have you examining sculpture in a more tactile fashion, while newcomer Camille Prioleau's cross of Donald Trump's The Apprentice and Flavor Flav's Flavor of Love will definitely bring the drama. And Shelley Hallima's chocolate menage a trois - well, enough said - read it yourself.All in all, an enjoyable collection by some exciting authors."
5,Great minds think alike,"Erotica is changing and so are those who write it. Once, only found covered in brown paper wrapping, erotica now appears everywhere, and in all forms, from the graphic to the subtle. Chocolate Seduction is one of those books that take you from one extreme to the other and you'll enjoy the ride to either end of your trip. Writers from across the genre spectrum team up in this book, bringing their specialties together to make each erotic story unique and fascinating as well as sexually lingering on the mind. The publisher had a great idea with this compilation of talent. I hope there will be more anthologies from this group of hot author because together they are on fire."
4,My night are more Beautiful than your Days.,This is a Drama and a love history between a man and a beautiful dancer.with the lovely and gorgeuos Sophie Marceau.
2,Dissapointed,"Movie is in French with English subtitles and is about a man dying of a brain disease and a young married woman who loves him. As his disease progresses his words make no sense -- but this whole movie makes no sense. I loved Sophie Marceau in Firefly and thought this would be another wonderful love story, but it's very hard to follow with flashbacks from both of their pasts which torment them still. Rent it instead because you won't want to watch it again."
2,French only,"Contrary to the jacket shown here, its write-up and the Amazon description, this is only in French (including the jacket -- Mes Nuits sont plus belles que vos Jours). It's supposed to have English subtitles, but I haven't found them yet. It looks like it's a good film, and I really like Sophie Marceau, but it's really misleading, although the Product Description does say it's in French with English subtitles. I've been studying French for a couple of years so I'll keep it, but if you only understand English, forget it."
5,Revised Edition is Much Better & Low Priced,I would simply say that it is a great book if you want to save your thousands of $ on immigration or job search. I would recommend to buy its REVISED VERSION released by Lightning Source U.K Ltd.
5,Works great as an ice preventative.,I live in Texas so ice on the windshield isn't much of a problem. I had ice scrapers and I was all set. Then I lost the ice scrapers. So of course ice all the time. I ordered 2 of these for less than 2 bucks a pop and there hasn't been ice since.
2,dint like much,"single brush strip, so wont be that strong to clean. but oky according to the price. i would buy more better one though."
4,Lacks attention to detail...,"Overall this is a really cute scrapbook to use as your child's baby book, however the manufacturer really should reevaluate it's quality control measures.I ordered a second copy of this item because the first one I received had some major flaws. The ribbon near the bottom of the cover in both books I received was folded over & was stitched down crooked (one book was far less severe than the other). The metal plate that holds the book title was also mounted crooked. Also, the pink color was extremely different on both books (one was cotton candy pink, the other was baby pink). I decided to keep the one that was just a little screwed up because I like the concept so much, but I will be replacing the ribbon & attempting to re-mount the metal plate.I guess I just wish that this manufacturer realized that people use their books to hold their child's most precious memories, and they expect everything to look perfect. Disappointing, but not a deal breaker in my case!"
1,O.o,"Was looking for the history channel documentary, it was not this one. Still watched it but it was pretty boring as the documentary consist of people after people talking about some thing called transpersonal psychology. The problem is this documentary keeps talking around the topic instead of talking about it. By the end i am still not sure what transpersonal psychology is...."
3,Huh?,"Kinda OK. Circles and circles around the subject. After watching the presentations, I still don't think I can acurately describe what Transpersonal Psychology is. I would watch it again, but it wasn't THAT interesting.GM"
1,The dangers of buying online,"Do not buy this mug. What you do not see in the above picture is the large corporate name etched into the other side of the mug. These mugs were some corporate give-away item that the retailer is pawning off as ""hand-crafted, one-of-a-kind"" items. This is the first time I've felt genuinely ripped off by anything purchased through Amazon. When you add in the shipping costs, you will pay almost $25 for a coffee mug that you could be handed for free in the lobby at a convention. This dealer's karma will catch him with him eventually, but in the meantime, don't buy anything from him."
1,I wish I had read the last two reviews before I bought it,"yeah I have to say this book is quite disappointing..I bought it hoping to gain more confidence but it didn't help at all. I think it's kinda ironic that on one hand, it talks about how we should fully accept who we are, on the other it gives the examples of how confident people are like as if to show that's how we should be."
5,what a book!,"I am just about to complete this book and I can unequivocally say that it has had an absolutely huge impact on my life. I have grown in confidence and boosting my confidence was the reason for buying the book. Along with this, I have become far less self critical which is a key to becoming at ease with yourself. I dont judge people as much as I used to, and I now understand that dealing with insecurities can improve your life tremendously. I could list many more benefits but I will keep it to the above. There is a lot of writing to do and at times you will feel like you are back at school, however dont rush, if the book takes a year to get through, be content in that the benefits will last a lifetime."
1,Disappointing,"The basis of this book is that you shouldn't believe you are fundamentally flawed, but then makes you more aware of your flaws by pointing out incorrect thinking. The author uses too much jargon and spends too much time trying to explain the meaning of the jargon. The supplementary exercises seemed unnecessary and overexplained. This book made me feel frustrated and worse about myself! The premise of the book: accept yourself - flaws and all. The end result of the book: identify your flaws."
3,Not as impressive as I thought they would be,"As with the other Ultegra components that I installed at same time as this (See my review for the Ultegra Shifters), I still have the chain rub noise and adjustment requirements are frequent. Just not sure they are worth the price differential. Actually think the 105 level components are just as good"
5,Hazlitt!,"William Hazlitt, though not much read today, remains one of the greatest prose stylists of the language, and with Dequincey, one of the two best of the romantic age. A must!"
1,Not as described.,The product description and photo show a three piece rod set. You only actually get one rod with handle. Returned.
5,Awesome...,"read these as a kid and loved them then. My daughter tried the first one and then requested the whole series. She devoured them quickly. Then my younger daughter plowed through them. My wife grabbed them after that... someday soon, I may even get to read them again. Good times. Lloyd Alexander tells a good story, and these are classic and a good read. I highly recommend this series."
5,Great series of books.,I read the Chronicles of Prydain when I was a kid. My son is 11 and we took turn reading different chapters. It is very similar to the Lord of The Rings accept not hundreds of pages of boring descriptions which I like. I would recommend this to anyone over the age of ten.
5,"Classic, accessible to youth","The books arrived on time and in good condition.Our previous copies were worn out and we had duplicates of some and had misplaced others. This boxed set is nicer than our previous mixed size collection.I have read these numerous times with pleasure. I have read them out loud to boys age 4-8 who really enjoyed them. I am pretty sure they have all read the books themselves, from age 10 on. Lloyd Alexander uses accessible vocabulary and delivers a lot of plot and description in short, well worded novels. This makes these books ideal to read aloud or for growing readers."
4,More Black than Green,"The product goes on like the higher end ones, but the color was more black than green. Another minor downside is that the casing the pencil is in is plastic, not wood which will require that I get a new sharpener."
5,This stuff is GREAT!,I went to a Chinese Acupuncturist who is a licensed Doctor in China. She used this Ultra Balm on me. I have been hooked ever since. She told me to use just little dab of this with Vaseline. It works better than any other over the counter stuff available in the Pharmacy section. I stopped using other liniments in favor of this one. It has a powerful icy-hot feel that soothes deep pain and muscle cramps plus the aroma doesn't bother me and I am very sensitive to perfumes.I would not recommend this for young children.
2,"Ok DVD, but the car mount is a JOKE","Okay, I'll admit the player itself works, but the car mount kit is a joke. It all depends on a flimspy plastic hinge that will break as soon as the temperature heats up.Considering that the included car mount kit was the point of difference that influenced me to buy this device instead of other cheaper options, this is a big deal for me.To be fair in the nearly two years I've owned it, the dvd has had no problems, but the car mount hinge is not worth the up charge from a more reasonably priced option."
4,Decent Player,"A little hesistant to buy since target doesn't have a samply one hooked up to see quality. Bought one and charged it and it didn't read any new DVDs. Well, took it back thinking would get a different brand. But none of the other players, for the price, seem to match up. Its nice that the dvd player has a battery pack so we could take it on the plane. But also since it comes with the extra screen my daughter gets her own to watch as well. Plus I like the brackets to attach to my headrest easy and sturdy so far. Only drawback so far is you cant charge the battery if you have the monitor attached to the headrest. The removeable battery covers the mount hookup."
1,NO DISC Error,"We bought at target. We used for about 3 months then we start receiving the NO DISC error message I tried cleaning the lens as Philips suggested but NO luck. The support also broke very easily, it's not kid's resistent.Terrible choice."
1,Worked only Once,"We bought this DVD player for a car trip, and it worked great the first trip back in March. We've always been very careful with it, and have kept it in a very nice case. When we got it out to take on the 2nd trip, I didn't even try it, but once we got going, it didn't work. The disc won't spin at all. I was on hold with customer support for 45 minutes, but they are finally sending out a new comparable replacement model. Hopefully that one will work at least one more time than this one did."
2,Very unhappy with this DVD player,"This is the 4th portable DVD player we have owned and by far the worst! We previously had another Philips single DVD player that was great, but it was stolen so we got this one instead. SAVE YOUR $$$. Half the time it doesn't play the DVD at all."
2,Worked for 6 months then it stopped working,We purchased this product at Target receiving good reviews from their website. It worked well for 5 1/2 months but recently we were receiving NO disc error's we cleaned the eye with electronic cleaner per Phillips website but still will not work. When putting the DVD in it reads no disc and sounds like it will play the dvd but then stops with error message. Do not make the same mistake we did by purchasing this player.
3,Therapy Elbow Wrap,I gave this product only 3 stars because it is almost impossible for one person to put it on.Didnt see where any magnet power was there.
2,Not so cold cold pack,Ice pack is smal and melts very quick. After freezing this cold pack in the freezer overnight i used this on my forearm for pain it the ice pack is small and melts fast.
4,hard to beat for the price,"I got two of these wraps and for five bucks each, you're not going to find better. (Buying more than one mitigates shipping costs). I just wish they stayed cold a little longer. I freeze the whole thing so the gel pack doesn't waste effort on the neoprene, and that helps.The wrap fits over my elbow nicely and man that soothing cold feels great.My advice: when you do the math choosing what to buy, figure on twice as many as of these as you think you need. (That probably applies to most of the competitors as well.) But even if you have to reload often, these things are still a great value."
2,ok..,The ice packs really don't last very long but it works fine for the first 10 minutes. I wish it lasted longer.
4,Baton Kaitos,"The game was good over all. I just wasn't too fond of their ""twist"". However I think that it was still okay."
2,Not worth $15,Bought this based on the reviews but returned as the content was disappointing. Not quite worth $15 since the FEW topics covered can be easily researched online. Not recommended based on value.
2,Outdated,"I purchased this book to get more detailed information about hikes and activities on Maui and Molokai. The information in this book is more of a historical nature than a practical one, with little that is really useful. Also, it looks like this edition was last updated in 2001, and this is very apparent on reading through it.If your interested in history and trivia, this book's for you. Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere."
1,Not impressed,"I was very excited to recieve this base coat. I am attempting to grow my nails longer, now that I am getting older. I would never purchase this product agaian. This base coat does not keep my polish on, and it creates not barrier for my darker polished. I put this on and then painted two top coats and my nails were still stained red from the polish. I am very dissatisfied."
2,Cult reading,"Right I stumbled across this on the net. Don't be fooled ino thinking that there is much to learn about poker in this book unless you are a back stabbing low life. After reading a few pages it soon becomes apparant that there is a nasty undercurrent running through it. The book actively encourages deception, deceit and a selfish mindset. At one point it even suggests a characters actions caused the death of one of his poker 'buddies'. The only regret being he was no longer available for fleecing. This is a book written by a cult leader and should be treated as such. See his site at neo-tech.com to see the real reasoning behind the 'tatics'.In conclusion an interesting look into the mind of a mad man."
1,very marginal,"This book has some unintentional entertainment value, as the author lays out his Machiavellian mind set. But I found almost nothing of actual use at the poker table."
4,"If you want broadway, this isn't it...","I did alot of searching on the internet for a vocal selections book from the broadway musical version of The Wiz. This book you are looking at now is the vocal selections from the 1978 movie 'The Wiz,' starring Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. I finally found a vocal selections book from the broadway show, and it is out of print, originally published by Fox Fanfare Music. Just letting you know, because the movie is quite different from the broadway show."
4,When the saints go to worship....,"If you haven't heard Benita Washington's debut CD entitled Hold On then you're missing it. She doesn't just sing. This sister ""sangs!"" She ""sangs"" and all to the glory of God. Her cover of When The Saints Go to Worship is awesome. This track is already one of the PraiseNWorshipTeam's favorites.This CD worships, praises and encourages. If you're going through this is an encouraging CD. Praise your way through with the track When the Battle Is Over. You can hold on to this one. Be blessed!Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life.... 1 Timothy 6:12a"
4,It Should Have Been Me,"Saints and friends, this is a great CD to put in and clean or read but be warned, when track 9 comes on, you'll stop what you're doing and give God praise for sending his Son Jesus. This song really moves me. I listened to the one song all morning until finally reaching the conclusion that I must listen to the COMPLETE CD to hear Benita's msg. Her sounds, her choices of songs and her clarity are real and very welcoming in this age of generic 'worship' music. Thank God there are still those who sing to us OG's who want to hear REAL Gospel music! God bless the hearers of this CD."
5,Quick Toning: Thighs of Steel,"I love all of Tami Lee Webb's tapes. This one is not ADVANCED, however.I should have realized that. It's too easy for me, but excellent for most folks."
1,"I would have liked it, if I ever actually received it.",I previously owned this workout tape and love love loved it!!! Accidentally threw it away in a move. Very disappointed its been 5 weeks and I have not received video tape yet.
1,Lousy,"Too many quick movements that jerk your joints around. If you have joint problems, don't buy this video. I wish I could return it. I had another Prevention workout and that one was not great either. I will stay away from Prevention workouts."
2,Boring and bouncy,"I have to agree with other reviewers. I've owned several Prevention videos, and this one just doesn't live up to the brand. The interval routine alone is so boring, repetitive, bouncy, and uncreative, and the instructor so distracting that I can't even finish a lousy 21 minutes. You repeat the same 3 steps (mambo, shuffles, high knees) over and over in the low-impact segment, and then in the high-impact segment, you repeat THE SAME THING all over again, only with a bounce in your step! Lots and lots of bouncing. (And ""Ilyse"" is supposed to continue the low-impact in that segment but you can see she didn't get the memo.) The instructor does a LOT of ""hup"" and ""nice"" to the point of distraction. Honest, if she's doing anything more after that, I don't know because although my body could keep going, the rest of me said ""enough."""
4,Works well for S/PDIF Digital Audio,I'm using this cable to deliver S/PDIF digital audio from my home-theater PC to my stereo receiver. No problems at all. The cable is very solidly constructed. One surprise is that the cable sheathing has an odd textured grip that's different from the smooth sheathing on most cables.
5,Both a look into the past and much of it practical use,"I bought this primarily for the first book, but was much impressed with the other two as well, and the supplimentary documents are informative as well, you see a lot of what is commonly practiced today, it's probably true that this was a foundation book, especially the last two books, and the only thing I had trouble with, which is understandable for the time it was written in, is the really, really, long sentances, most the time becoming there own paragraphs, but it doesn't detract from the information itself. :DAnyway, I did notice a couple actuall problems. The text is printed on each page side by side, like a lot of bibles. In a few places it seems the last few words of the chapter were cut off so the right block wouldn't be longer then the left block.I assume this was an accedent and still got what he was saying though, so I kept it at 5 stars."
3,outdated. not for current use.,"The three books of occult philosophy is a book of it's time. it has many obvious falsities in it's magical thinking, the most obvious being the belief in spontaneous generation of life - flies from rotting meat, ect. As a historical reference, it is great, but as an actual aide to ritual, it contains a bevy of outdated and assumed data."
1,Out dated,"Occult philosophy based upon Medieval perspectives of a clockwork reality - a mechanistic view of things. These days we are aware of how fluid and insubstantial everything is - including our own physical forms. Everything in these three books serves to anchor the enthusiast firmly in a clockwork notion of how to relate to, and interact with, forces and intelligences, etc. As a much more sensible alternative, get into the more cutting-edge sects of Quimbanda, ( such as the type of Quimbanda practiced by Master Saint ). At least they're clicking along according to what has been realized by physicists in the modern era. Leave this stuff to library shelves where it can collect dust - forgotten and an anachronistic absurdity that it has become due to the expansion of knowledge."
3,"Nice, but hardly useful","Greetings,This edition of the ""three books of occult philosophy"" is probably the best ever done, my hat's off to the editor for both his great editing and ""footnotes"" well done!Unfortunately, there is little in the book that is of any practical use by the modern Magus. The only purpose I have found for this book is to sit on my shelf, looking cool. The book is enjoyable, even though it's not of much use, it give lots of nice insights into the beliefs and practises of the occultists of days past.The wonderful plates alone make it one of my favorite books to ""leaf through and look impressive""Posing aside, this book is an interesting read for some background information...If you're looking to find out what made the old occultists tick, buy it, if you're looking for something to put to practise, look elsewhere."
1,Missing most of the book,"This version appears to be missing all of the diagrams and tables that are integral to the book. Wait for an edition that has the full set of diagrams, etc."
5,The Ancient Teacher,"This is a great book, actually 3 (you will see Agrippa's letters to various people for each book), for studying the occult philosophy. It is NOT a difficult book to understand, but it is a long book which may be the only thing that intimidates people who do not like to read big books. Agrippa clearly describes what he means and quotes various sources to make his points. This volume is also good because Agrippa's sources are cited by the editor and context is given. Various plants or things that will be unfamiliar to the casual reader are explained in the many notes accompanying each chapter. There is an interesting biography of Agrippa in the beginning of this volume and there are biographies of many of the people Agrippa quotes and speaks about in his books of Occult Philosophy. I absorb things easier by taking notes so I have a notebook and summarize each chapter so I can better remember things."
5,One of the Best...,One of the best books on the subject available. Tyson may have made a few mistakes but he more than makes up for it with the annotations.
2,"A classic work of philosophy, unnecessarily modernised and badly edited","It is a pity that this philosophical classic has received a modern makeover in this edition. The modernised spelling does not work for me, plus the New Age vibe emanating from the commentary does not go well with the source text at all. As much as I admire Agrippa's original milestone work, I do not recommend this edition."
1,$400 Paperweight,"The iPod suddenly went dead after five months of very casual use. Since the warranty on this is 90 days, I enquired about an out-of-warranty service. The repair would cost $270 (not including shipping and taxes). You can buy a new one for around $300. Apple was very unsympathetic. When I first got the iPod, I thought it was a great product. I've changed my opinion entirely. The fact that the iPod only comes with a 90 day warranty is risky especially since the repair is so expensive. My advice is to only buy the iPod if you can get an extended warranty. If, like me, you believe items like this should have a standard one year warranty, buy something else or you run the chance of being stuck with a $400 paperweight."
4,iPod CAN work with the PC,"Just to set the record straight, you *CAN* get the iPod to work with a PC. A company by the name of MediaFour is currently writing the drivers to do this, and they have a public preview available for use on their website...Hope this helps anyone who is thinking it's impossible to use the iPod with a PC.I only rated this 4/5 stars because this player, albeit small, lightweight, and user-friendly, does not have the capability to record and also had no native support for the PC. In my opinion apple could have sold a bazillion of these things had they released it with native support for the PC, but it's all about the apple loyalty, I guess."
5,Truly elegant!!!!,"The iPod is the most elegant piece of electronic equipment I have ever used. It is incredibly functional and very, very cool looking!! I transferred 3.5 gigs of music and almost of gig of data in less than five minutes - firewire makes a huge difference in connectivity times. I am able to get between 8 and 9 hours on a charge - very nice. A couple of extras are needed - a case is a must - Apple should have included one - I also needed a pair of headphones - I don't like earbuds and the ones supplied with the iPod are too large for my ears. If you want a music player and firewire hard drive, the iPod can't be beat. Plus the wow factor when you pull the iPod out in public makes one proud to be a Mac user."
5,A Must Have for any firewire user.,"Light weight. Versatile. It's a hardrive you can carry with you all the time. I work from different location and this little gadget is a blessing. Transfer files back and forth in seconds. With xPod you can use it with any PC. You just need a firewire card. You can also hook it up in your car with an adapter and you won't need any lame cd/md-changers. The price is a little steep but so far there's nothing out there you can compare with it. If you want something that's both sleek and practical, this is it."
5,iPod -- Definitely By Far The Best!,"I just bought my iPod, and I'm hooked to it! This thing rocks! (Even WITHOUT music!) As I post this review, I'm listening to my iPod. So far, mine has lived up to being all that Apple said it would be. The iPod would appeal to a range of audiences, both young, and old. I enjoy listening to mine on the way to school in the mornings. If you get one of these, you'll find that it will keep you company very well.Simply put:This is THE BEST digital music player to date!"
3,SAT Intimidator,"This book is one of the worst book I've encountered. It overprepares you. The problems are so hard and the problem difficulty level is like 10(Maximum difficulty level for Actual SAT I is 5). They got some pretty good tips though. If you have lot of time, you should memorize 3500 basic word list just to increase your knowledge. I recommend Barrons Math Workbook, Kaplan Verbal Workbook, and 10 Real SATs."
3,don't bother,"I wish I bought the 10 real SATs book or a book with a CD instead of Barrons. Although this book has good strategies and flashcards, I would not bother buying it...This book has practice tests, but the material they're testing you on is not what you will see on the SAT. It is somewhat different in the manner the questions are put and the material focused on. Therefore, do not get this book for practice objectives. The best part of this book is the flashcard section. But don't buy this because of that! You can find a better solution to a limited vocabulary...Bottom line is spend your money on something else!"
3,not terrible,"well, if ur taking the sats the barron's can be really annoying- the word list is way too long firstly, but the math tests are definetly harder than the actual sats- so remember tht when u do them, but otherwise its pretty good, it explains everything very well but its really annoying to study for the sats anyway so good luck!!"
3,Misleading...,"This book is great---if you want information. There are a lot of strategies they give you on math (most of them that you already know, but still helpful). The vocabulary list is fairly long and you won't remember some words unless you have a great memory.The bad part about this is the tests. The math part is hard...which is good, but if you have no experience in taking the SAT or doing any real practice you'll feel intimidated. I used this book and did some of the math, doing worse than usual. Yet on the real SAT, I did much better.Anyway, buy it, it'll raise your score...but it's not the best of the best. I recommend 10 Real SATs over it, but give the book a try."
4,Very Helpful Tool,I used this book in my preparation for the SATs and I had great results. I now work with pre-collegiate students and this is the book that we use to prepare them for their SAT's. It is a great tool!
3,Not for the serious crafter,"I do not appreciate the craftmanship exhibited in this book. The projects are fine, but I did not find them particularly creative. Irene Semanchuck-Dean(sp?)'s book had better projects and more finesse."
4,GO PACK GO,"Love finding Packer bracelets different than others. Good size and fit. Good color, arrived quickly.I am a big Packer fan"
5,Awesome!!,Great tunes! After seeing them live in Colorado recently I couldn't help but make the purchase. No disappointments!
1,Someone is Scamming,"It's too bad, it sounded like such a nice book for my children but I can't afford to pay $193.99 for it..."
4,Timothy walker is a fraud. dont pay mind to his review.,[...]The game is good and it does put you in the grounds that the real soldiers fought in. you get the sense of history playing this game. i think the game is to short and the missions are way to short but a fun game overall. ghost recon is much better on-line but of line bia is better.
3,this game sucks,single player is fantastic but when i seen it i was hoping it would be like conflict vietnam where you can have a 2 player campaign. plus the missions were easy and if they only had a 2 player campaign it would be fun
4,Great game!,"I thought this was an excellent game! Although the squad-based genre has overtaken the market (Republic Commando, Ghost Recon 2), in this game you get to experience the war through the view of a WWII US Paratrooper with the 502nd PIR. You start off by yourself, but are soon taught to lead one man, then a squad, then a Fire Team and an Assault team! The default setting encompasses no aiming reticule, so if you want to shoot at a German, you need to physically pull up the iron sights. You can go into Options and add a reticule. Once you unlock Authentic mode, you can't add the reticule, or suppression indicators... its as real and as confusing as it can get!The one thing I don't like (but I get over it fast) is that in one Chapter, your fireteam members can get killed, but they are resurrected in the next one... my thought is, if they get killed, that's it!"
4,This is Impressive,"I was so amazed by how real the game feltThe sound is the most impressive. it give noise from one side of the t.v. when the bullet is coming then on the other side when its goneIt has a emotiional side to it that makes you not want to get your allies killedPlus there actually useful for killing the enemy, and flanking them which as part of the strategy is so important in this game.You can't just win by being suicidalBut its not like Splinter Cell when you can be spotted by a Squirrel and then you lose the level.The graphics are pretty but you can actually see the enemy, unlike Halo 2 when they are always in the shadows.I was a little dissapointed by how few levels there were. But every level is very detailed and there are many ways to do each one.As far as length this is about as long as it gets these days in shooters.I would not give it to kids under twelve, but don't let your kids not get it just because of the rating mature, its more of a history lesson than a game."
1,Buyer Beware,"I don't know how much fun the game was because it would not play on my XBOX 360S Console. I did not open this game because I bought another game and opened it first and it would not play on my console, so I returned this game. The seller was very cooperative and understanding. When I loaded the other game, some verbage appeared that said ""you must attach a Microsoft XBOX 320GB Hard Drive before it will work on your console."" WRONG! I spent $150 for the drive and the game would still not work. I updated my console and the game would still not work, before the update or after! I went online to XBOX 360 website and after a bunch of clicks, I found a list of all the ""Original XBOX Games"" that work on XBOX 360 consoles, and neither of the games I purchased were on the list. Before anyone purchases ""Original XBOX Games"" they need to have an ""Original XBOX Console."""
4,Bros in arms by a idiot,frist of all this game is coming out on Ostober 16 . this game the most realstic war game i have ever seen real people and real strets this game is going to be asoume if you like medal of honor you will love this game
5,The best war game up to date!,"Brothers in arms is probobly the most realistic war game that i have ever played in my entire life.PROS:1.Graphics are great2.VIOLENCE and BLOOD, what everybody wants.3.Lots of missions.4.Online that never lags/disconnects.5,Realistic as hell, for example, you don't have a crosshair, when you want to shoot, you actually have to look through your scope.6. Music/Audio is great.CONS:1. Controls can sometimes be hard to memorize2. Sometimes the images that you see while the game is loading is TO gruesome!As a result, you can see by reading my review that this is really the best war game there is out there!"
4,Awesome game with minor glitches!,"If your looking for an intense WW2 combat game that is still realistic this is a great game. The game boasts smart AI, realistic graphics, and also the ability to make the player grow attached to his AI squad of paratroopers. However, the game has a few glitches. For Example, in the game you can not jump over a wall or through hedges. Also, the german riflemen rarely hit you, while if you stick your head up for not even a second in front of a machinegun 50 yards away you automatically die. Overall, I'd say this game is a must have!"
3,Brothers in Arms:Road to Hill 30,Very good graphics. Some scenes can be tough to battle through. Can't always tell where shots are coming from.
4,The Gods,"The book arrived late but in good shape. I was surprised the book was typewritten rather than printed, but that doesn't affect the contents!"
3,Carry-on Air Con,"This air conditioner really works even in the most humid South Florida weather, however it is a darn heavy piece of kit to get into position over the bow hatch. The brackets holding the wedge that locks the levelling foot came out after we had only used it twice so had to use blocks of wood. It's quite a big unit that gets in the way on a 25 foot weekend cruiser when putting to sea so it needed to be landed daily to give us space. Apart from the foot wedge brackets the unit is very sturdily built and resists well the knocks of the transportation back and forth from truck to boat."
5,Robert Louis Stevenson book,The book is great. It was what I expected and it came so soon after ordering.
2,"2 months and 4 calls , still not activated.","The phone is nice and has good features. I bought this for my son for Christmas. He was so happy he told all his friends. Well at the end of Jan. the phone still was not activated. I called 4 times. Customer service sucks. I do not think any of them new english that well. And then one guy was trying to explain to me that the phone won't work without singal, like I am stupid. He told me this 3 times. I got so mad I had to give the phone to my husband before I started to say things that would not of helped. I gave up after the 4th call. I finally told them to cancell the whole thing. My son liked that because of this my son ended up with a flip phone from verizon. And I end up paying more. Stupid tracphone company."
1,Using TracFone is like making a deal with the devil,"Terrible customer service; misinformed service reps (I was told that I would be able to transfer my existing Tracfone nubmer to an upgrafed Tracfone, which wasn't true). Trying to get a refund is next to impossible. As someone who has used TracFone, I can say with absolute certainty it is not worth it. Learn from my mistakes and go with a more reliable pre-paid service such as AT&T, Cingular, Virgin, etc. Avoid TracFone unless you want sub-standard service, false promises, and crappy phones."
4,For those use don't talk all day or for emergency use,"I have used the Tracfone service for about three years. I went prepaid because I did not use the monthly minutes of my previous cell phone plan. I was wasting my money every month. I use the phone to call and check in with my children and other short phone calls probably less than 20 min a month. I would not recommend prepaid to those who use their phone to makes lots of calls, the price per minute is too costly, but for those who use wireless ocassionally, prepaid is the way to go. From the comparisons that I've made it appears Tracfone has the cheapest per minute rates.I have had no problems with the Nokia 5180i and find it a pretty simple phone to use. The reception has been good and the coverage is acceptable as well.I use the website for renewing my minutes and it is pretty straightforward. There are long wait times if you do need to speak with customer service but they have always worked out my problem after the long wait."
3,Retro Nokia,"This was the second cell phone I ever got(both the first & second bulky phones were from Nokia with service from Tracfone).The phone itself worked fine. Back in the day the size was just right. I liked the amount of ""monophonic"" rings built into the phone.Tracfone's service was just ok. Only for people who use their cell phones sparingly. Otherwise the cost of prepaid is too high.Good phone back in the day..oh by the way, I know this phone is old; but Amazon has the ""date first available"" set at July 7, 1977. Whoa! Maybe Dan Tana could've used this instead of his car phone."
4,"Good, Simple, Inexpensive Phone...Great Coverage!","This phone is easy to use and good for people using 50 minutes or less per month. I keep my phone active for about $ a month.If you want longer battery life and slightly smaller, the motorola(more expensive) is also a good choice. I don't agree with others about the tracfone website or their customer service. I have had very little trouble and have activated and purchased phones,added time and referred customers through their site. ..."
1,Too little,"Pamphlet, not book is a better description. The type is so tiny that you can barely read it. Information was disappointing and process used could have been terrific, but was presented in such a way as to be boring."
3,Engineering background may help in reading this book,"This book is very technical for the average person However, it gives insight about how to predict the future, at least a tool to do it. Forecasting is never be precise and always rough. So, in that respect, this book is OK"
3,Not quite THERE,"Tho it's more than I've ever seen available on this subject in 1 book, it's not quite what I expected. For instance, my favorite directors (Jaglom & Rudolph) did many, many films that are not included in her book. Perhaps the next edition can include EVERY movie by a diretor, while indicating with an * those that are actually reviewed in the book. Also, some classics are missing such as Diva, The Moderns, King of Hearts, etc.<P>PLEASE, WILL SOMEONE WRITE A BOOK THAT IS COMPREHENSIVE?<P>Thx,"
1,Not so much a guide as a list...,"This guide to independent films is quite a mess. A straight alphabetical order makes it easy to find films, but without some mention of distributors or a production company, it really doesn't explain what makes each film an indie. The reviews themselves are subjective to the point of annoyance, focusing more on the author's lies and dislikes than on the merits of the film. Some reviews actually have two different scores, (""Evil Dead"" three bones for fans, but for me just one."") a concept that makes absolutely no sense. Have an opinion and stick with it don't hedge your bets. Even the indices serve no real purpose, listing some actors and directors and not others and only in the indies that are in this book-pointless. As a critical guide, this book is useless; as a list of films you might not be familiar with, it has a purpose."
5,Informative guide to independent films.,"There are over 800 independent films reviewed here. The reviews are thoughtful, richly detailed and sometimes irreverent, just like the films themselves, and are obviously written by someone who knows and loves movies. Included are excerpts of interviews with directors and an excellent index section which includes a category index cross-referencing a wide range of film categories from Lovers on the Lam to Yuppie Nightmares. All in all, an excellent guide to indie films(and video rentals) providing entertaining reading."
5,Vac Bags,It was all so easy. No problems. Shipment came just like I ordered it. Thanks so much for making it go so smoothly
3,Not one of Francome's best,"Plot seems a bit farfetched in my opinion. Main character weak and undecided., which I found a bit annoying. Good background and characters."
4,helpful to understand different culture,Helps me to understand student culture. i am writing a paper on cultural expectations and this book was helpful in understanding foreign culutre
2,Poor Performance as a Singer,"Unfortunately, Danilo Caymmi is not a good singer.And this album consists of hits which came from TV themes in Brazil, specially the well-known national soap opera soundtracks.This is a cover album and all the original performances of the same songs are better than Caymmi's rendition...."
4,A Real Find!,"This is a truly excellent CD. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c I don't understand French. Ms. Bitton has an outstanding voice. The songs are well-chosen, and this CD has fueled the beginning of many a romantic evening. I regularly give this CD to clients and friends during the holidays."
4,A wonderful read.,"I just loved the way the story line went, with it's in's and out's in every chapter. I did not know who is behind it all, or what to think.I have to say that the author has a way with words, when it came down to the love scene, not going into so much, I'll let you read it for yourself.I am not a book reviewer, but I do love the book, and the way it carry itself from chapter to chapter, I'll be looking foward to the next issue of the Max Stone series.PatJust another reader."
4,Interesting story line,"I had read lots of novel from new authors, to old ones. However, I do love the way this new writer wrote his book, and the way it moves along with the story, and characters, like 'Max Stone'I do recommend this book, and hope you will enjoy it as I have. Can not wait for the next book to come out.a fiction nut."
4,Equal Opportunity Offender :-),"This DVD is histerical. If you are politically correct do not view this album... or wait. Maybe the politically correct are the ones who should watch! Loni Love has a unique way of getting down to the nitty gritty and calling it as she sees it. On this DVD, she ""shares the love"" with just about every group imaginable: blacks, whites, Asians, hispanics, gays, fat people, etc. She makes fun of groups while simultaneously building unity and acceptance. Clear the way to the buffet!"
3,An Interesting read,"I really did enjoy this book, I loved the characters, and the plot. I wasn't bored reading it, not once. Although, I didn't like the end, but in some strange way I can't really imagine it ending any other way. If you are looking for something different, intelligent, even a little twisted, with an artistic touch thrown in for good measure. Try this book out, you may like it."
1,terrible,"This book is so bad, it made me angry. The characters are absolutely ridiculous, they act and speak so unlike actual human beings that it is excruciating to read. What is trying to be humor and satire falls flat. The plot limps and gasps along, bludgeoned by the ludicrous ""coincidences"" and twists. Irredeemably terrible."
1,Beware - this is NOT the right version!,"This is a fantastic CD and all, but as of July '07, what they're shipping is not the ""10 Years After"" (Dix Ans Apres) version, which includes a bonus disc and has all 33 pieces listed on this page. I got a single 16-song disc, the same one I bought 3 or 4 years ago. Buyer beware."
1,"Never received - no return phone call/email, etc, etc","My opinion is that Amazon no longer understands anything about the ""customer experience"" a term its founder coined and became famous for - and that the company has comprimised its values for the sake of qrtly earnings. They will take your money and will not deliver your product as they say they will - and the refund never happens. This is the second time! Never again. Amazon is the only company I have had problems with like this - it makes brick and mortar look appealing.It will catch up with them sooner or later."
3,Bought cd instead of Dvd,I was expecting the dvd of the film! but did not know how to send back etc. is there a dvd of the film
5,"The songs pump solid, raw, heartfelt blues.",Jeff Taylor has created a wonderful piece of blues with hurtin' game. Check out Worst of It Yet. Great lyrics for all of the heartbroken souls. Jeff kicks a** on his Les Paul guitar. The Hammond B-3 sound is alive and well on this CD. As a drummer I want to hear solid bass drum and bass. Byl Carruthers' production puts the subwoofer to work and drives the heartfelt music home.
5,Very nice machine,"After much deliberation and self debate, I bought this bike from someone other than Amazon. (I spend about 2 months doing research, then needed the ""immediate satisfaction"" that comes from purchasing from a walk-in store). I've had it since right after thanksgiving, and think it's one of the better purchases I've made. It seems that with the fan-type exercise bike you get fewer bells and whistles, but more strength and reliability. I've had one treadmill and one ""fancy"" exercise bike die after just a few months. While this machine doesn't play music or show me videos that try to make me believe I'm riding through the French country side, it does feel like it might just last forever."
1,QuickCAD has been discontinued by Autodesk,Autodesk has announced that as of 9/30/04 it will no longer support QuickCAD. Not only that but version 8 is 3 years old. I bought it less than a week ago and the build date was 2001.That is the only reason I give it one star. QuickCAD is actually a very good value. It is almost exactly the same as Autodesk's Autosketch software which costs more than twice as much. Autodesk also has a very active user's forum for QuickCAD/Autosketch which will answer almost any question you might have.I still haven't decided whether to keep QuickCAD or return it and buy Autosketch. I think QCAD will serve my needs but as long as I am buying my first CAD package for home I wonder if it is smart to buy into a dead end program.
1,Yuk,The tutorials and help information are so bad with this software that it is useless. I gave up and went back to hand drafting for my construction/renovation business. Instead of saving me time it was a waste of time and money.
4,Good value,"I ended up buying this program for work. I was able to immediately sit down and begin working on floor plans, with a little experimentation.I ran into a few stability issues, but they are few and far between. ""Buggy"" would be an overstatement.I found the symbol libraries very useful. It is also very easy to create your own library by re-organizing the current symbols and/or creating your own.In short, it may not have the power of the big, expensive products, but it is an excellent product for its price range."
4,In The Road To CAD,"I was interested in switching to the Computer for my design needs, but I was sure that I needed a way around AutoCAD R14 to start. But at the same time wanted to have the compatibility.Quickcad 8 was the answer, It lets me play around with a simple interface (1 of 3 actually, depending on your skill level). Got myself started with the included and simple 2 minute tutorials and I was on my way.With a little patience, it took me about 3 weeks to get comfortable and go about my business of interior design smoothly. If your looking at drawbacks, well, 1) I can't load 3D designs created by the more sophisticated Autodesk software, and 2) I have to load the *.dwg autocad symbol libraries one by one and save them in Quickcad format *.cad, for later use.Overall, it's a great tool for those of us who want to keep it simple."
4,Extremely Good Design,"QuickCAD 8 is an amazing program. It has easy to use functions and its compatability with Autocad is incredible. It takes very little time for the program to load, and once it does the program is just awsome. Great features include its Windows like interface and that it doesn't take up much memory on your computer."
1,How are you supposed to learn?,"I am upset I bought this, there is no instruction available for learning it. The Getting Started book does NOT give enough information to get started. The user guide (300 pages available only on the CD or as download) is not written for a beginner. Autodesk says after the getting started book you can start drawing; well I have read the book cover to cover and I am not able to make the settings for a floorplan or draw a line for one wall. I have spent hours trial and error without success (and this after taking an intro to CAD class in interior design). Autodesk is misleading at best, and they have no customer support, not even an email listed on their website. I wasted my money!"
4,"Primer for New Catholics, Blast from the Past for Old-Timers","One of the author's goals in this work is to ""distinguish between the essentials and the trimmings, the tradition and the customs."" She meets the challenge in 13 chapters dealing with such topics as the Mass; sacraments; prayer; Mary; angels and saints; and ""Catholic practices, minor and major."" The section on Catholic practices will evoke memories, if not nostalgia, in those who grew up in the 50s, but younger readers may be amused by the era's rules for fasting, women wearing hats to church, ""making"" the First Fridays, and the like. As a pre-Vatican II Catholic, I read about Forty Hours devotions wistfully.Each chapter contains relevant margin quotes with reference notes and a short reading list. An extensive index is included. This work would be especially helpful for catechists, parents, and those involved in, RCIA programs."
1,Torpedoed by it's own extra material.,"Perhaps other reviewers do not read margin quotes. One was from Andrew Greeley, and another one referred to the Holy Spirit as ""she"".If you can swallow this drop of poison, the rest of this little book (178 pages) is a light, easy read covering many topics that most long-time Catholics probably do not know (i.e. what does the title ""Monsignor"" signify, what is the significance of the Church calendar, what is a ""sacristy"", ""alb"" or ""chasuble"", how is the American church organized, what are some of the changes in Catholic practice brought by Vatican II, etc.)Although it would get a high ranking without the quotes, in its current form it does not merit the ""Nihil Obstat"", a few bucks, or more than one star."
1,Be smart and avoid buying the Honeywell Lynx security system,"My installer and I have been having issues with this system ever since it was installed less than 1 year ago. It would beep arbitrarily at any hour of the day or night and I'd have to disconnect it from the main source and the battery from the panel to get the stop the beeping. It also gives error messages to numerous areas in the house, such as area 8, 9 and 10. This is what triggers the beeping. My installer has been on the phone twice with where he bought the system. They tried diagnosing it and it would work for a few days a weeks and the beeping problem would come up again.The Honeywell Lynx security system was recommended to my installer by his friend and oddly, his friend now has the same problem I have and he can't even change his security code. I am going to switch to an ADT or Brinks system and they can hopefully recommend something more reliable."
3,AN EARLY ADVOCATE OF THE RIGHT-TO-DIE,"Ruth O. RussellFreedom to Die:Moral and Legal Aspects of Euthanasia(New York: Human Sciences Press, 1975)The author makes no new argumentsbut masterfully summarizes the arguments advanced thru the years.Also contains a good historical survey of the right-to-die movement up to 1975.See some other recommended books, reviewed on the Internet:""Books on the Right-to-Die"".James Leonard Park, advocate of the right-to-die with careful safeguards."
1,Ouch!,I bought this because I thought it would be fun to see Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland in their older years. Not to mention Ceaser Romero.....but man oh man what a stinker of a script. Don't bother.
3,A different era,"Garlock takes us on a trip back in time to the depression era where a doctor's visit was fifty cents and there was such a thing as a `doctor's house call'. Like so many small towns on rivers in the Midwest, the authors shows how bigotry against skin color, education, and which side of town you live on can be destructive for all involved.Her romance plot seems incidental when she brings out the secrets so prevalent in the rural river town. Interesting psychological character development. A master at capturing the flavor of small towns with its small thinkers."
5,Elvis country album,How can you not love Elvis' music no matter how old? Glad I found it available on amazon. Ordering was super easy too.
4,Very cute book,A charming story with Old World flavor about a little old woman who doesn't know she really is a witch. This story imparts values about kindness and forgiveness to young readers.
2,A little disappointed,I thought this book was going to be a great book by what the discription had said. I wanted a book covering maintainence not the history of where the impreza came from. Still a really neat book though!
4,another old scooby book,"the car on the cover is an older GC body impreza (maybe its even a jdm sti?) and if you are a fan of subaru imprezas up to 2002 this is a good book, if you are looking for info on newer ones this book isnt for you. lots of pictures. some good info, but most of this is on the internet now. if you don't like using google to find car info, this is a good book. the other book had a bit more bugeye content, but both are good resources. seems like old magazine articles."
5,Jack Benny can do no wrong!,"All 6 of the tapes in this series are worth buying, as Jack Benny was one of the funniest comedians we've ever had. If you still have a VCR, buy all of them!"
2,Foreign Subtitles,"Perhaps I didn't read the fine print, but I was not prepared for foreign subtitles in the purchased movie (Japanese?)"
3,7 out of 20,"This is a double-disc CD that is not available in the U.S. So I ordered it from Amazon UK just like a fellow reviewer did. I spent $14.00 including shipping. I too, heard a few songs from XM Chill rado station and fell in love with them, well 7 out of 20 of them are fantastic, but the 13 others sound like weak disco which I just don't like. My favorite 7 are: Marathon, Dejante, All Men Think About, Levraati, Someday I Will, Iso Maha & Deja Vu. I still think it was money well spent. Seven new songs in my life is a good thing!"
5,Great Tool,"When I found I could print small PDF file booklets with a HP 1320 printer using both sides of the paper and selecting the option for ""booklet printing"" I was ecstatic... but of course one needs a long reach stapler. This is the one I opted to try and it was an excellent choice. I buy many electronic and industrial tools of this quality and often for five times the cost. This is a great value, very well made (in China of course) and welcome addition to my office. One standard sheet of paper is now 4 pages in a small booklet. This thing will pay for itself in no time!"
2,Frustrating,"The Swingline Long Reach stapler we have in our elementary school consistently jams. It takes on two staples at once so they jam up at the end. I have to take a paperclip, uncurl it and fish out the jammed up staples. Makes putting books together frustrating and time consuming."
5,LONG REACH STAPLER,I PURCHASED THIS STAPLER SEVERAL WEEKS AGO. TRIED IT AND IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR TO STAPLE BOOKLETS. THE BUILT-IN RULER IS GREAT.
4,Swingline long reach stapler,I was looking for a sturdy long reach stapler. It has the strength and sturdiness. I hope this product will serve my purpose well.
1,this is not a film scholar's book,"Half a year ago, I read its Japanese version of an article written by aaron gerow included in the book, since I am a Japanese. I found the conclusion of the article very unsatisfying and unconvincing, because it abruptly quotes what a famous and young Japanese filmmaker said about a certain relationship between Japanese Emperor and Japanese film, which completely lacks any academic contexts in which we could discuss. Judging from the article by aaron gerow discussing Benshi, this book is nothing less than an arbitrary impression on Japanese cinema."
1,A Far Cry From Stunt Track Driver,"Following on the heels of Hot Wheels' StuntTrack Driver program (1998), I figured this onewould have even more exciting stunts andfun driving. I was very disappointed to find thatthe graphics are much less detailed and displayin a very jerky way, even on the same PC.The steering is also much harder to control.Stunt Track Driver was challenging at first,but was well worth the time once mastered.Stick with that one if you are looking forHot Wheels fun on the PC. I also highlyrecommend LEGO Racers 2 (2001)."
5,Christmas Crafts Fun,"This is a great book with clear photos and directions for Christmas things from home made mint snowpeople to tree decorations, that appeal to kids and adults."
5,An Indespensible Tool,"This manual explains how to determine astronomic and state plane grid asimuth for the purposes of preserving land surve evidence, avoiding confusion, and resolving problems.It is ideal for the thrifty land surveyor as it requires a minimum of equipment to use."
1,No way....,"Just by pass this and go straight for the real thing. Not to offend anyone, but I was let down."
1,One week,Only have had gloves for one week and they already ripped where the thumb goes. Poor product for the money.
4,Form and function in weightlifting glove design,"These are lighter gloves than I was used to, which gave me pause at first. I'm still not sure I like the thinness of the GoFits compared to my Harbingers but I give them credit for engineering and design. The smart construction is designed to give you pull handles for getting them on and getting them off with minimum stress to the fabric. This will avoid the tearing that caused the Harbingers to eventually become unstitched in the fingers. The padding is adequate when lifting but would be better with more padding. I have to add that as I get used to them it becomes a non-issue. Shipment of my order was snappy."
3,Gets the job done.,"This product is fine, it does what it's meant to but could be better. There are strips of light padding across the palm which provide scant protection. I feel that the glove's quality would be much improved if the entire palm surface was covered in this padding. Surely this wouldn't add much to the cost."
3,Very poor padding,"After reading the review of the Harbinger 1215 Big II, I went for the GoFit, but what a mistake.Pros: Easy to put in and take offVery goo fitLight and thin breathable material (very thin, soft leather)Cons: Very poor padding (hurt the palm of the hand (more than without gloves))Except that, shipping and packaging faultless.I will buy the harbinger now :o("
3,Picture somewhat inaccurate - padding has gaps,"The padding is in horizontal strips across the palms. When it lines up with the weights you're holding, it is helpful but I've found that to only happen on curls and vertical presses, not standard bench press. Instead the bar settle in between the padding and the gloves are only marginally helpful."
2,very disappointing,these gloves looked great in the picture but when I got them they felt super cheap and in twoweeks of using it its already falling apart get something else not these
3,Great grip but they lack comfort,"I just picked these gloves up today and used them at the gym for the first time.....and overall they were ok. The gripping strength is definitely there as I had no problems with grip for weight training. The only major problem these gloves have is that they have NO PADDING at all ....If you are a serious weightlifter using serious weights like me, then these gloves are not for you. If you do light weight or you are in the gym for lighter weight and more repetitions, then these gloves will definitely serve their purpose. Overall, for $12 bucks, these are a good deal, but Go Fit definitely does not impress on the comfort and padding level for the more rigorous weightlifters. I am not sure how well the duration holds up on these gloves since it was the first time at the gym but if they fall apart quickly I will make sure to update on that."
2,OK but low quality,"These fit OK and have the perfect amount of padding, just enough to protect the skin on your hands without needing a lot of break in time. The problem is that the stitching along the side of the index finger has already broken after 2 months of use. I lift 3x a week and missed a couple weeks over the holidays during that period, so this level of durability isn't acceptable"
3,Don't lift with gloves; these are okay though,"I got these when I started strength training. They're fine if you want gloves, but the more I've learned, the more I see that gloves interfere with good lifting. When you're lifting heavy, gloves cause the bar to press against the gloves and your skin, leading to bigger, rougher calluses and more hand pain than lifting bare-handed with a solid grip. Unless you have some specific hand or skin issues -- or, I don't know, a dirty rusty bar that could give you tetanus -- just lift barehanded."
1,not for weightllifting,no padding at all. Your hands will heart. these gloves are not for weight lifting!!! If you want them for riding your bike maybe will be perfect. But I doubt if anyone who left all these positive reviews have ever lift weight with them!
1,Looks good but thats about it!!,I just bought these gloves and wore them for the first time at the gym. I now have painful calluses in my palm. The glove does not have adequate cushioning for weightlifting. Apart from that they look good on your hand but does not do the primary job of protecting your hand.
2,Insufficient padding,"I use weightlifting gloves to improve grip (which the GoFit gloves do) and to provide comfort as well as prevention of callouses. These gloves have very little padding and cause discomfort when lifting heavy weights. I've used them for only two sessions and I'm already starting to develop callouses on my palms. The gloves are starting to fray a bit at the first knuckle of the thumb (lowest knuckle) from contact with dumbbells. I suspect this will eventually wear through and cause blistering at the knuckle.If you are the type of lifter who likes to really feel the bar for more control or just wants some extra grip due to sweaty hands, these will fit the bill. If you want to lift in comfort and prevent callouses, look elsewhere. I've already ordered Schiek 530Platinum ""Gel"" Lifting Gloves, which I've used in the past with excellent results and durability."
4,a little more padding and these would of been perfect,"I wanted to try these because it seems I am always buying Harbinger. I ordered an XL and that was exactly what I needed. They run a little bigger then Harbingers. The fit is good. I would of liked to had a little more padding on these gloves, but all in all I can live with them and they do the job."
1,"Dangerous, junk!!!!","These are okay if you lift light weights. First thing, the yellow velcro closure on the back had only 1 stitch and ripped off after 2nd use. The worst thing is the grip...little to none. Do not lift heavy weights or deadlift with these, they slip!! They simply do not hold the metal bar. I went back to my old worn out gloves that had leather palms...until I can get some new decent ones. Be wary... spend more if you lift heavy!!"
3,Decent features but too thin,"These gloves have a lot of advanced features you won't find in most brands, such as the terry cloth back for wiping sweat, or the rubberized interior thumb/forefinger grip. But if you are going to be lifting heavy weights more than a few times a week, the thin layer of synthetic leather on the palms will leave you with calluses. However, if you will not be lifting heavy or often, these gloves have a lot of great features. Just a note, the disc that comes with the gloves only works on PCs, so if you have a Mac, it will only make a shiny Christmas ornament."
5,"Where is the second edition, from University of TExas Press?",This book was reissued in a new edition by U. of Texas Press in 1999. In fact you used to list it regularly. Why is it not there now?
4,Nice piece of equipment,"This came promptly in a large and heavy box. The instructions could have been better as there were a few things that were not clear, but I was able to assemble it without much problem in about an hour. In general everything was in good shape, but as another reviewer noted, there were small tears on the arm pads. It is very sturdy, but after a few weeks of use I need to go back and retighten some of the bolts in the base. I mostly use it for the dips and pullups and have had no problems. The handbars for doing pushups are a good idea but not very useful, if you are not careful about your position you will hit your head on the cross beam - some other reviewers have noted this. Even when I am positioned correctly my hair brushes against the bar so I rarely use it for pushups."
4,More effective for pull-ups than dips or push-ups,"Assembly was pretty involved, which I expected. I really like the grips onthe pull-up bar. We do have two problems w/ the power tower: 1) the wholemachine shakes when we do dips. That could be because we have it on carpet,which is probably less stable than a floor would be; 2) when you do push-ups,there is a bar that you bump your head on if you're in the correct position.You have to either hold your head up or down, out of alignment w/ the rest ofyour body. Overall, I believe the machine was worth the $100."
2,Not great for chinups,"The product is sturdy, but then you have issues. It shipped super quickly. After receiving the product, I found that none of the hardware for putting it together was in there. I had to call Amazon to find the maker since the box didn't show any contact info and there were no assembly instructions.They quickly sent that out and I was back on my way.With the pushup portion on the back of the Tower, you need a lot of room to use it, so that is against the wall and unusable.But the biggest problem. When you do pullups, the bar doesn't extend far enough out from the back rest. So if you attempt to pullup to quickly and your body rocks, your legs hit the back rest."
4,Wow a true workout - to assemble,"Nice unit and good price, some components were not sized well and it took some real brute force to pry the metal brackets to the correct width... heck of a workout getting it set up and then a nice stand when done."
3,Buyer's Remorse: Others have multiple grips.,Pros:1. very stableCons:1. Other machines have multiple hand grips such as narrow grips2. I agree with other comment regarding grips would be better if they are rubber material since it will be less likely it will deteriorate to drying out and cracking.
4,Good investment!,"I haven't tried other towers, so I can only speak for this one. It's a great piece of equipment in most respects.Only a few flaws:the push-up handles should've been positioned in a way that would allow a person to use all angles of push-ups instead of just one which is necessary to use if you don't want to end up hitting the back of your head;the padding material on the pull-up bar and the dip handles should've been something different as the one used produces a burn when your hands slide off them;the machine is either a tad bit unstable or my floor is slightly uneven, but I think it's the former, so if you weigh over 200 I'd recommend a more robust tower.Other than these minor faults, this power tower delivers in all respects and I'd definitely recommend buying it."
5,Pleasantly surprised....,"I was primarily looking for a pull-up bar to support circuit training without going to a gym. Did some on-line research and found this one. I ordered it on a Tuesday and it arrived on a Friday with the free shipping. Box was intact, parts were all there, and it was easy to assemble using the instructions (about an hour). I am 6', 230 and it has been great so far. No rocking using the pull-up bar or dips. I don't have any problem with the push-up station either. For the money, this is a heavy duty piece of equipment."
4,great equipment for gym,"excellent machine for the price. very sturdy, good construction, despite being made in china.amazon deal very good esp. with free deliveryamazon's customer service was excellent (they took care of a delivery problem that was not their fault, pleasant no hassles)make sure your ceiling is high enuf for doing pullups"
1,Unused Product Due to Missing Part,"I would love to review this product, but there's a problem, it was shipped to me with a missing part. Therefore, this piece of equipment has been sitting idle in my house for a little less than a month. I received this product on June 12, 2006 in a box that was in very poor condition. I wondered how it was able to contain its heavy content. The box was ripped (big holes) and held together by bands and clear tape. I'm pretty sure the condition of the box was the cause of the missing part. I ordered the part a few days later through the manufacturer. As of right now (07/05/2006), I am still without that part and have an unassembled Power Tower collecting dust in my house. Based on other reviews, I am pretty sure it is a great product. But due to my misfortune, I am unable to review this product with satisfying results."
1,Purchased Jan 18 but it has not yet arrived.,I was asked to review this product by Amazon on Feb.18.The item was purchased on Jan. 18 but has not yet arrive.Cheers!
4,Simple,"I ordered the Ironman tower and easily assembled it by myself. The only issue was it's height! Somehow, I missed that dimension and I couldn't fully utilize the chin-up/pull-up bar because my head wouldn't clear the ceiling. I'm 5'2"" and it is a stretch for me to reach the bar - I just utilize the push-up handles for a boost, but a 6'1"" friend easily reaches it and finds it effective. The stand is simple, but it's balanced and feels stable when I use it. I like it."
3,Ironman Power Tower,I was expecting the grip padding to be made of more sturdy material; actually I thought it would be more rubber than cushion padding.
4,Delivery Caution,"Happy with the product, very sturdy. I'm not however real pleased with the delivery of said product. The box was torn to shreds and I was missing a part. I'm sure the missing part fell out of the box during shipping. The power tower is a great workout; offers variety."
4,Exposing Explicitness,"Excellent expose of the explicit sex industry with very few errors (i.e. pgs. 341-384's Production and Distribution...chapter could've used proper noun ""city"" insteadof ""area"" and Los Angeles' Hollywood and Sunset Strip as the largest of its state's""urban districts"" featuring such businesses during the 1970s (when over 400 of them were proliferated)."
4,East Texas Reigns in this novel !,"For a first book, I thought it was extraordinarily addictive. This type of romance isn't usually my cup of tea, but it was fresh and fun. A young East Texas widow moves back to her hometown of Mooney, Texas and it is replete with characters one would suspect live there. Ultra-religious mother, spinster aunt, and, of course, the cute as all git-out handyman. I just ordered the sequel."
4,A nice way to pass the time,"I really liked the characters in this book. I liked reading about their lives and I liked the fact that sometimes you can start again. I thought it was good that Ash had to work so hard to get Lucy, it seemed that he really wanted her then. She didn't just fall into his arms like so many other women did. Didn't like that fact that he was a bit loose nor that she would just take his word for things. I also would have liked to know why she bothered marrying Mitchell and maybe a bit more about that relationship. That relationship just seemed so blah. Then she hooks up with Ash eventually and her life seems so much more . . . more vibrant, passion, just more. It was really a decent book!"
2,Romance readers will love this one...,"Every once in a while, I'll buy a book I know nothing about. Usually I end up being pleasently surprised. This was not one of those times. I'm a little confused by all the great reviews this book has received. If you believe the message of this book (find a man to have great sex with and in doing so you will find true love and happiness) than this is the book for you. Romance readers will love this one, I guess."
3,snow shovel,"I ordered this shovel because it said it was a non stick shovel. Untrue. I used it today and the snow stuck on it, so why they said it was non stick stuns me. I'm not going to send it back because it will cost me ten bucks, so I'll just use it for debris cleanups."
5,pretty cool,fun book. shirley does a great job of telling it like it was. you won't be disappointed.
1,Murky on my Z3,"I can't recommend this item. It just won't give me a clear picture. If anyone has had success with this lens on a Z3, I'd sure like to know how they did it. I've tried every setting I can think of, including macro and I simply cannot get a sharp picture."

5,the best,"this is the best c.d.!My mom bought it for me,and it was gerat.Public enemy,and godsmack'c preformance is great.Buy it if U can..."
3,it leaks,I love the size of it. But I would not sugest anyone put anything into it that cannot get wet. Because it does leak. Not a big deal for me. ID and Cash and my car key dosent matter if it gets wet. But people should know it does leak it is NOT waterproof.
3,Standard hard plastic shot put.,Standard 12 pound shot put. Very hard plastic will damage wood floors if dropped from too high a distance. This was purchased for winter work.
5,Successor to the lengendary xr55!,"...what it has that the xr55 does not: HDMI, dual-amping of front mains now available during 5.1 playback, one extra set of component inputs, and all-channel stereo (called ""party mode"" on other receivers).Otherwise the internal components are identical, so expect similar performance---in other words, outstanding SQ when matched with the right speakers, blows away all other receivers under five hundred bucks and most under a thousand.See my lengthy review of the xr55 for more details.Boutique audio shops do not want you to know about this product, because it'd put them out of business...they make much higher margins selling you receivers costing several times this Panasonic's prices, since their profits are usually a fixed percentage of the street price."
4,"Store screwed me, but receiver good","I'm just reviewing the receiver, not the store.I'm no audiophile, so take that into account.First I bought a Panasonic DVD / VCR player /recorder. I picked that because it was about the best rated. Then I bought a Panasonic plasma because again, it was about the best rated. After I got the plasma, I found out that Panasonic devices marry up well, so I went on the search for a Panasonic reciever. The Panasonic receivers weren't best rated, but were very good. Good enough for me.The receiver is easy to use and set up. If you can't have perfect speaker placement, the receiver allows you to set them differently. It seems to have real good sound with my polk audio speakers.I like the way it marries up with my other devices. While it's not one button on, one button turns everything off at once. My dish network remote takes care of most functions very easily.My wife is pleased with it as it's simple to use."
1,Snow Shovel,This snow shovel is an overpriced piece of junk that will last about 30 seconds when you use it because the handle will fall off the shovel. There are two tiny holes at the point the shovel attaches to the handle for (I suppose)small wood screws. The handle is too short for an adult to use and will continually wobble and fall off. Bad design all around.
5,Awesome movie,"Definitely worth watching! It's kind of mesmerizing and magical, and it's certainly worth your time. I highly recommend it to anyone."
2,Not my cup of tea,I heard some good reviews for this movie but i was quite bored with it. so it's not my kind of thing.
4,A nice movie to watch around the holidays,"By no means a Christmas classic, but the movie did carry a feeling of a holiday flick. I was expecting a movie about the mysterious circumstances surrounding Hugo, but what we got was a slight deviation from that. The character development is actually done very well and there are some interesting twists along the way."
5,Saw the movie,"It was a really great movie, the preview was a useful tool in deciding to see the movie. Rent it or buy it, it was very good."
5,Transcends 'Good Anime',"Don't for a second think that this'll only float your boat if you enjoy other anime. It borrows none of the story telling devices or cliches, instead it's a series of vignettes that explore the physics of this world. And what a lush and beautiful world it is! So quiet and eternal, this show is calming in a way that reminds you that nature brings life and death, and that that's ok. This show doesn't compromise it's characters for wow factor, the ending of a show always makes sense. Might seem slow, but keep with it. Beautiful, worth a watch from anyone who appreciated the art of storytelling."
3,Fair Selection,"This compilation of 10 Johnny Cash songs, is only fair at best, and does not warrant the price. I won't condemn this selection of songs, as Johnny has a vast library of material to choose from, although including ""The City Of New Orleans"" with ""Ring of Fire"" on such a small selection of songs sure seemes like a poor choice. Worst of all, is the sound quality. While the selection of songs spans a fair amount of time, there's no reason the sound quality could not be cleaned up so that there wouldn't be such a wide contrast in the volume between track one and track 10! Do yourself a favor and choose one of the other numerous Cash compilations; there are better and more affordable collections out there. C-"
1,Slow shipping,"Arrived after I left for my trip, so I did not get to use it. Tried to return it, but they said keep it."
2,Pocket Dictionary,"Unfortunately I had to return this item. I was expecting a ""pocket"" dictionary to actually fit into a pocket but what came was to large. These dictionaries actually come I guess you would call it mini size."
4,Mini Concert for Your Kids,"This video stars many of Canada's all time greatest children's music performers! Fred Penner,Charlotte Diamond, Etc. The songs are catchy, fun, dance-able and positive. Themes include being proud of yourself, caring for pets, being silly, collections, friendship, make believe and more! Transitional scenes take place in a train station! Good fun!"
1,Waste of Money,This was a waste of money. It doesn't pick up half of the available channels. It is big and awkward to handle too. I was very disappointed. I didn't return it because I didn't want to waste more money on this thing. This is the only product I have ever been disappointed with from Amazon.
4,Does the job,"This works as well as the flat antenna I paid $30 for. It's ugly, but what traditional antenna isn't? At this price you're paying for function. I docked a star because I don't get every local channel."
5,Stunning,"For $9.99, I got access to full HD from the local channels, which is all I'll ever need. Perfect quality, I got all 69 channels the RCA product page claimed to get! I did have to adjust the antenna slightly for one channel, but not a huge deal. I uploaded a picture (webcam quality..be warned), but honestly this antenna works as described! Recommend completely!"
5,works great,"i was a little worried based on some reviews people wrote but i plugged it in and i have 9 free channels, no i can watch the news and antiques roadshow good enough for me"
1,Not this one.,"No good luck for me. I get nothing out of this antenna. I've tried all places and angles I could possibly place the antenna, but only three extremely fuzzy channels showed up."
2,not too bad,Not doing what i thought it would do you have to move the antenna around too much. you need something bigger
3,it is okay,I have a hdtv and I thought it would pick up all the channels in analog but it only picks up a few HD ones. I guess I still need the digital converter box.
1,I can't receive a single channel!,It just doesn't work no matter where I put it. Good quality always doesn't come cheap. Stay away from it if you can.
4,OTA TV,"This product is as expected. I get all my local channels in HD now. Sure, some adjustment is needed from time to time, but that's a tradeoff with a signal over the air.As others have stated, the 2 'rabbit ears' are a bit flimsy so be careful. Also, the attached coax cable is short and cheapy - it would have been better to let me supply my own and save more costs on this, but hey."
5,works great,"Works great with my TV! Perfect reception, looks like I have expensive cable tv! Totally worth the buy and I am very pleased."
1,No good,I received this antenna and proceeded to set it up only to find that the hole to screw one of the antenna poles into was too big. It is being returned.
5,love it.,Great signal....I love it. It works great. I have no complains. I am very satisfied with this product. It came quick and it is not hard to connect.
1,"Awful, do not buy.","This purchase was such a huge mistake. The UHF loop didn't even fit into the holes they were meant to be in, I had to actually hammer them in to get them inside. Then, I try to plug it into the back of my HDTV, and the pin is too big to fit into the coaxial input. So I force it in, thinking it's no big deal as long as it works. Well, no channels came in at all, so I was fed up, ready to unplug it, and out comes the copper tube that the coaxial pin plugs into. So now I can't use another antenna if I wanted to."
4,Strong Little Backup Antenna,"I use this antenna paired with the RCA ANT1450BM using a combiner (Channel Plus 2532) and it helps to strengthen the signal for less noise/break-up. I only gave it four stars because, on its own, it can't pick up as many channels as the ANT1450BM, but the ones it does pick up are strong and solid. Overall, a no-brainer for the price. Highly recommend."
3,Ho Hum,"I'm about 50 miles from a major metropolitan area. But even still, with this product I only got 3 channels at nearly unwatchable reception out of a possible 26 or so. That was with the rig right up against the sliding glass doors, on the second floor of my complex, facing out toward the city. If you're outside of a major metro. area, go with an external antenna for any hope of reception."
1,"Ok, if this was 1965","Actually, it really isn't ok even if it was the 60's.Are they kidding? Technology just took a giant step backwards, turning the clock back to the 60's or 70's with this design.90-95% of the TV markets do not have stations on the VHF low band and approximately 75% do not have stations in the VHF band at all (despite of the stations still using their old channel 'numbers'. Those ""ears"" are then worthless.Get one of the ""Silver Sensor"" or it's clones (as long as it's not a 'Terk' for less than $18. It's the same design the NAB used for testing in their white papers on ATSC years ago!BTW, RCA is ONLY a name. The company died decades ago, just like all other US TV manufactures."
1,It just doesn't work!,"hmmm...,I wasn't lucky with this order, the antenna didn't give me any signal on my TV.I tried different positions and adjustments, but it DID NOT work at all. Quite disappointed with this shopping and it does not worth to pay for the return fee."
3,Fair product,"Product is satisfactory for the price. Arrived fast well before the expected arrival date. Great price, fair product value. Not the highest quality but for the price it certainly does the job."
1,Garbage,"Garbage- Didn't do a blooming thing! Antennaweb.org advised I should be able to get 3 channels with indoor antenna, and I got none."
3,"signal not strong/stable, and only several channel can be found","signal not strong/stable,we live in small town, looks like only 3 channels can be found. I hope I can get more"
1,Total piece of junk,"I never could get the prongs on the circular antenna to fit into the base, so I also never could tell if it worked. Such a cheap piece of trash that it was too much trouble to return it. I just threw it away."
1,Just Plain Old Rabbit Ears,"The description said it was a digital TV antenna. It's just a plain old set of rabbit ears. While it may do the job for DTV, I think buyers would be better served buying something more modern and if power is available, amplified. I would not recommend this to a friend. We all probably have an old set in a closet someplace in the house already."
1,Basic indoor antenna,Did not pick up more than five channels in my home. Probably due to how far I live from the broadcasting stations.
1,Four stars? REALLY?,"I bought this ""antenna"" from another source, same product tho', and it does not work even a little bit. People who are getting a picture from this thing, can I get a toke off what you're smoking?"
4,Great Value,It looks old-fashioned; but it does pick up the signals.Of course you have to re-orient it sometimes formarginal stations. Can't beat the price.
1,No range,The nearest tower from me is 7 miles and it didnt pick up any channels. it was easy to install but doesnt matter if it doesnt work
4,Works well.,The antenna draws in local channels well. The adjustable antennas are delicate so one has to treat them as such.
1,Didn't pick up a single station,I bought this after reading the reviews. I wanted it to use in my RV. The TV I tried to use it with was brand new. This antenna didn't pick up a single station. We decided to use the RV antenna. This is now just a dust catcher.
1,Broke first time,I hooked up the antennas and extended them. One of them broke the very first time. The metal is very thin on the extensions.
2,Old rabbit ears have failed me.,"Got this when the cable was out. Didn't work; I tried a different brand and that also got no results. It may be my area. However, this antenna feels cheap and light, and the antenna broke. So from a quality standpoint, its poor."
4,Great price/performance,"I have this hooked to a TCL 43"" LCD TV. It's not perfect at getting signal indoors (i have it set behind my TV in my second floor apartment). The signals, when I find the ones I want by adjusting a bit, come through clear and the HD ones are very nice. Overall I'd buy it again at this price."
3,Okay for price,"In my town there are 20 stations broadcasting so I was excited to get this because my house is right in the center of town where the main signal for the TV stations is. I plugged it in and checked my signal and could only get it up to 50%. I went to check my TV stations and only got 3 including a Doppler image, music videos(cool TV), and NBC. So after spending $60 on the whole set up I got one channel. It is really not worth the hassle.If you are going to get an antenna I would recommend spending a little more money to get a more powerful antenna so you don't have the same problems that I am having!"
4,PERFECT AND EASY TO SET UP!,I bought this antenna at Best buy it's really good and affordable gives me local HD channels but for some reason whenever a car drives by my apartment the picture goes choppy! other than that it's so good!
4,Great Antenna,"I purchased this antenna for $10 at BestBuy to use in a two story home, 38 miles from the broadcast station. When i connected it to an upstairs tv, it received all UHF and VHF stations clearly. When I connected downstairs, it received all UHF, but not VHF. This may be due to several features of the house blocking a direct signal. Overall, this is a great antenna for the price. I now use it upstairs in my bedroom and the picture is great, even at a 38 mile range."
3,not all together satisfied but kept it.,This antenna works better than the one that came w/ my little portable DVD/TV player. I don't use the DVD player.This antenna was a little difficult to assemble in that the smaller of the two parts I couldn't make fit into the space they were meant to be. I asked a son to assemble it for me and he had a hard time getting it into their little sockets....and I can't get all the channels that our big TV's get but its okay for what I want of the set.I bought this from Amazon and I'm satisfied with the product but a tad disappointed. I'm satisfied w/ Amazon. They have given me several satisfied transactions.
4,As Good or Superior to the More Expensive Indoor Antennas,"The Basic Indoor Antenna is just that; basic, it is not attractive to the eyes, it does not have an electrical connection for so-called enhancement performance, it is an old fashion antennae and it works well.I have it connected to my USB Avertv computer tuner and it works as well or better than the more expensive enhanced antennae that I had bought. And it out performed a useless ""Paper Thin Leaf Indoor HDTV Antenna"" that did not work well with any television.My recommendation is to purchase this ""Basic Indoor Antenna"" before buying a more expensive antenna, and if it does not work you have lost very little and if it works you have saved the price of two to three months of cable service trying to find an indoor antenna that works well."
2,Doesn't work better than my wired fork,Just receive it yesterday. I plug it to my TV and I get only 32 channel when i get more than 64 with a fork and a wire...However it had a better signal with channels that it was able to get.
3,Broke Immediately,"The thing broke immediately when I tried to move one of the rabbit ears because the little screw was too tight (specifically, the screw that causes there to be friction to enable the ""ear"" to stay where you put it).Fortunately, I was able to take it apart, adjust the screw VERY slightly, and super-glue the broken parts back in place.(The antenna works OK, the problem is the programming isn't worth watching.)"
1,Doesn't work,"Tried to connect it to my TV that was meant to be a kitchen TV. However, it did not pick any channels - even an pseudo antenna that came with the tv set picked up two. This one didn't. So I moved it closer to the window and picked up some 6 channels, moved it to another window - picked up 3 channels.Took it along with tv set to another room with the windows facing another direction - 3 channels. Returning it today."
2,Don't bother with this POS,"Price: cheap, Usefulness: zero. If you're hoping to watch FOX, ABC, CBS, CW, or even PBS don't bother with this P.O.S. The only channels I was able to obtain were NBC, Telemundo, some channel name Quado and a bunch of other junk channels!"
2,"works, but not as good as what I had","This antenna does work, but the antenna I've had for 20 years is better. Choosing an antenna after this digital conversion is a crap shoot. I've resigned myself to never watching some networks again. I live 30 miles or less from all of our local stations and had no trouble getting every single station before the conversion. I could leave the antenna in place for weeks, sometimes months, with no problems. Now I can't move a finger without losing the entire picture. I refuse to spend $50 and up on an antenna. If you're like me, keep using what you have and forget about it. This antenna will not solve the problem."
1,Junk - do not buy,"I installed this on my tv and even aimed it at the right direction and DID NOT RECEIVE ANY CHANNELS, total waste of money. I am very unhappy with this product. I read the reviews and thought it would work."
1,Order on 31st of Dec,They are now sending my producted. to my home address. They never commuicated with there customers. My phone number is posted on my account information.
2,My bad experience,"This is the first antenna I tried, looking at all the great reviews I bought this product. I stay in DC a mile away from Capitol Hill on first floor with windows facing open street. This antenna did not catch even a single channel, yes, I swear not even a single channel. My TV does not have any button to tune the channels, this could be the problem. But I expected atleast few channels if not many. An amplified antenna might be better"
3,A NO-NO for Samsung flatscreen,"I was anxious to get this antenna to watch the super bowl in HD this year. Unfortunatly the antenna dos not seem to work work my brand new Samsung 51 inch hdtv with built in tuner. I troubleshooted everything possible with no luck. It says that it is compatibale both in my tv guide and on the description of the antenna packaing. I am giving 3 stars due to the fact that the antenna appears to be of good quality and it appears to work for other people, I am just out of luck with this one I suppose. Again if you have a Samsung flatscreen t.v. be warned!"
2,"Ok, works only sometime","only ABC and NBC channels works fine, all other channels comes and goes away. Not working always..One day it got completely stuck, couldnt able to change the channel and was turning off automatically after 2 mins, once i unplugged it, then tv came back to normal position."
4,Impressed,"I was pretty impressed by this little antenna. For a little over $8 we managed to get 21 channels, and that was without monkeying around with positioning. It's not the most sturdy, I did snap off one of the antennas pretty easily, but for the price that is to be expected. I probably wouldn't use something this flimsy if we used it every day, but we just wanted something to watch football on Thanksgiving and it worked."
5,Works great out of the box!,"What a great deal! $8 and I've got the basic network channels, right out of the box. This antenna couldn't get any easier to set up. I'm around 15 miles from the local TV towers, so I expected to get the channels, but I didn't expect the ease of use. This will supplement my Roku box in a room where cable could not be installed. Why pay more for an antenna! This one will get the job done."
1,Don't buy it!,This is the worst TV antenna I ever bought.Even didn't use it and it got broken when I was trying to use it.
4,Cheap and Works well.,"Great to pluck tv signal out of the air. Now when cable goes out I can still get local tv channels for news updates. My flat screen tv has a tuner built in and only needs 29 watts to work.So I plug me tv into a Black and Decker portable powerstation, adjust tv settings to ""air"" and get news updates on the tv regarding when the power will be back on.And if only the cable goes out I can still watch football on the local channels."
3,Works but is extremely fragile!,"I had this for a while, and it worked great but was extremely fragile. When I moved, I went to push the rabbit ears down and one of them broke. For the price, it was a decent product but this was definitely a case of getting what I paid for."
4,"Others love it, but...","It's a set of rabbit ear for 8 bucks.What did you expect?I thought I would be able to pull in the Boston stations, but alas.I'm able to receive 3 New Hampshire channels that I would never watch.Oh well."
1,Review,It broke fast. The ears did anyway. I did'nt know the ears were that weak and just by adjusting them they would break.
3,"Not bad for the money, but...","I had a dipole break also, but before it broke, the signal wasn't bad. It varied depending to which tv it was connected. The 48"" Sony Bravia got excellent reception on many channels, where the 20"" Polaroid got fewer channels, but was acceptable. I used a signal splitter for both televisions and do not believe there was any degradation despite the split, so I believe that the TV the antenna goes to has a lot to do with signal strength. Why do we have a beautiful Sony Bravia and no cable? Cable - $$$$, air - free. And by the way, the broken antenna still received a few channels with only one dipole."
5,Why pay more when this one gets the job done wonderfully?,"Not really much to say. This $10 antenna pulls in more channels for me than any other one I've tried. I don't live very far from the TV towers so the fancy amplified ones tend to overdo it and amplify the signal too much. This one doesn't need to be plugged in to the wall, is small, and pulls in every channel that's available OTA, including the ones that are broadcast from towers further away.If you're looking for an antenna, start with this one. At $10, you can't go wrong!"
2,Not the best signal,"I bought three of these because we recently decided to let go of cable and go with netflix and over the air programming. Well these antennas are definitely affordable and compact. They really do not require a lot of space. On the other hand, I could pick up a channel no matter what I did to these antennas. The ONE channel I did manage to pick wasn't something to get all excited over because I can hear it but I can't see it."
3,It's Okay,This is cheeply made. But hey you buy cheep you get cheep. This Antenna cant hold a tv station that long it breaks up. So I will later on get a more expensive tv antenna for my tv. Never again RCA!!!!!
3,Works but.......,Not as sensitive as I had hoped. Tried to use in inside the garage and it's worthless there. Worked ok near a second story window but we are only maybe 15 miles from the Sacramento/Stockton TV towers. DO NOT recommend.
3,"Good product, bad location.","I decided to try this antennae after reading all of the positive reviews. I had already tried a couple do-it-yourself antennas as well as the amplified indoor Trek, and the reviews seemed like this would be the magic solution. Unfortunately, the trees and mountains around my home still made reception difficult. On the plus side, Amazon allowed me to keep it, free of charge, so maybe I'll try it up in the attic some day or give it to a friend."
3,It is ok,"It is oIt is ok but I don't use it now, it is good price, k but I don't use it now, it is good price, I recommend for whom don't have cable and internet"
1,Garbage....,One of the actual antennas snapped off during assembly. I am NOT that heavy handed. Garbage...pure garbage. I never even got to plug it into the tv to see if it actually worked.
1,BE WARY! BREAKS EASILY--recommend sturdier antenna,"Bought this because I saw the great reviews and was referred by previous users. I know a lot of the product's efficiency is based on location and position--but my experience had another variable.It worked well enough for the first couple weeks--five out of the 7 local channels were coming through with a little tweak here and there. I think my location is bad because I had a lot of trouble getting a steady signal. I recently tried to get a local ABC channel, but while changing the antenna one broke clean off! I thought that I unscrewed it with how easily it came off--but it was a clean break without any heavy handling.I would say to be very careful with this antenna and to think about getting a sturdier one--especially if you have to move it around to get certain channels."
2,"Helps to amplify channels, but no new ones","While I did find that this antenna does a good job of amplifying the channels that were already coming in, I have not been able to pick up any new channels. One major concern is the design, which has two adjustable poles for channels 2-13, and a square loop type frame for channels 14-69. The two poles screwed in without a problem, but the ends of the loop that are supposed to go into the base don't even line up straight with the holes they are supposed to go in, and on top of that one of the holes seems to have something that is keeping the end from going in. Living close to downtown Minneapolis, I was expecting a couple more channels out of the antenna, and seeing as to how the loop that does not fit right into the base is supposed to pick up channels 14-69 and I am not getting any of these channels, I would say that is a major concern."
1,"works, but cheep","for the first 2 weeks it worked great, but from re positioning & moving the antenna around the little cable wire gets in knots then breaks. must be handled like glass"
3,ok..but not as good as I had hoped,"Based on the reviews I had read prior to buying this product, I had thought I was getting a really good bargain. And yes, I do have more now than I had before, but I get two channels that are very fuzzy. One that is very very fuzzy. And one that you can almost hear something going on, but you can't see anything. I do get PBS on one channel, but it's not any that shows up on any of my TV Guides anywhere I can find, so I don't ever know what's going to be on that channel. Basically, like I said, a few channels I can hardly see are better than no channels at all, but I defintely should have spent the money and bought one that was a little better"
1,doesnt work,I am not able to get atleast one single channel suing this antenna . I did try moving it around in the room and still no signal. i would say it is a waste of money
5,Great Antenna,Have tried about four before and did not work. With this one I can get about 16 channels. It is great and cheap.
2,economical but does work with all channels,"I live about 30 miles west of downtown Chicago. The antenna has very good reviews, and I decided to give a try. The set up was easy although I had to clamp down the loop-shaped UHF antenna with a piece of metal. I could install the other poll-shaped VHF antenna sticks easily by hand.The problem is that the antenna does not deliver channels 2, 3, 5, and 9 to the brand new Panasonic TV I purchased with. The only VHF channel I can get is 7. I recently met a fellow who told me that he bought an amplifying indoor antenna for $30 at Target and it gave him all channels (that I am missing.) Is this a UHF antenna? Consequently, I still have to stay with an expensive Comcast service that I hoped I could ditch by use of this new antenna. I hate both Comcast and this antenna. FYI, this is a totally different subject, but my municipal government does not allow any cable or cable-like service, including AT&T; U-verse, competing against Comcast."
4,Basic Antenna that just works,"I was looking for a way to get the local HD channels here in Austin. This antenna did the job. I was looking at more expensive models but decide to give the less expensive one a shot first. Glad I did. I live under ten miles from the signal tower (checked [....]) so I get all the basic channels clear (CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox, PBS, and WB). I would recommend this antenna."
4,not bad,4 stars for quality5 stars for shipongIts working and I happy.I use this especially for my receiver.
2,No signal,No matter where I placed it or what I did I could not get any channels to come through. This doesn't mean the product is bad however as I may just be in an area that has bad reception
1,Worthless,"This antenna was worthless. I was hoping to have more stable reception but this antenna got even more reception compared to the one I now have (which is not so great with reception, but much better than this antenna). I threw it away. Too much trouble to return it."
3,fine for what it is,"If you live within 15 miles of the stations and just want a basic antenna to get the job done, this will do it, however if your TV already came with a basic set of rabbit ears, don't expect this antenna to improve upon the rabbit ears at all. It is what it is, I don't remember being able to get antennas like this for 7 bucks back 15 years ago.. cheers to cheap chinese bulk manufacturing. Or not."
1,did not work,the RCA Basic Indoor Antenna did not work. I had to buy an amplified antenna. it said i needed more words in order to submit this review. this is the last review i will do. to difficult to and the font is too small to read
1,2 Channels,I ordered this as a Christmas present for my mom. I am glad I decided to try it out before giving it to her. Only 2 of the channels were clear even though I have 18 channels in my area. She got more channels with with her old one. Only good thing was when I went to return it to amazon they refunded me but let me keep the product. Not that it is worth much but still saves me the trouble of sending it back.
1,"""TRASH""","Not worth buying. Got better reception with the free antenna that came with my portable tv. I ended up throwing it out. In a word ""TRASH""."
3,Ok but be careful,"I'm not exaggerating when I state that one of the dipole antennas broke within less than 10 minutes of hooking it up. I had just hooked it up and had my TV scan for channels but no channels were found. I decided to move the antenna and fully extend the dipoles and just as I was extending the dipoles, one of them snapped near the base. I'm pretty confident I didn't put any excess stress on the dipoles and am guessing it was a material defect. Still, I was eventually able to tune in a few channels but only UHF channels from the loop antenna. I would have given this an above average rating (4 stars) but have to knock it down one star for the antenna defect. For the price, I still would recommend it as long as other reviewers aren't reporting the same problem with the dipole antennas."
4,It Works!,"Like others, I was afraid the antenna wouldn't work, but it did! I occasionally have to adjust it, but only to one or two positions. So I'm not having to find channels by trial-and-error. I live in a downtown area on the third floor of an apartment complex. The antenna is hooked to a Westinghouse flatscreen. With the picture I get from this device, I am SOOOOO glad I dumped cable. The HD is wonderful and at times, breathtaking."
3,marysu,"Not sure if depends on the antenna or on the converter box, but i need to stand many times to adjust the image :( The antenna is too big also i don't like that. The price is fare."
4,Free TV,"I didn't want to shell out the $30 extra a month for a basic cable package from comcast.. So I did some research into getting OTA signals.. Turns out they are pretty much everywhere! And Being in the City of Brotherly love I thought that OTA signals would be really easy to get.. I was right.. With this Simple antenna I recieve 43 Digital TV stations, many of which are HD signals! (780i or p-1080i or p)Couldn't be happier.."
3,flimsy antenna but does the job,"Flimsy antenna, metal pieces that pull out broke when barely touched and the other piece just sort of sits on the base w/ no way to firmly attach. Does work well @ picking up tv signals for a converter box- just be careful adjusting or moving it because pieces will break or fall right off."
3,It's Ok,I use this antenna for my bedroom TV. Its ok. I deduct 2 stars because it doesnt handle constant handling well. The end of one antenna fell off and now its hard to extend it. The other reason for reducing 2 stars is because I can't set the rectangle part of the antenna to snap onto the base. I have seen better antenna's and I probably wouldn't purchase this again if I had the money. Shop around for a sturdier designed antenna. If you are on a budget this will do
3,Set top antenna,"The antenna works well. The only problem is one of the rabbit ears has a threaded insert too small for the hole it is supposed to fit into on the mount. I only needed the antenna for the digital reception, so it did not make a difference to me, but their product quality assurance is not great."
1,It's not that I hated it but.....,"It just didn't work for me at my home even after looking up to see what channels I'd ""probably"" get. I ended up getting 1 with this antenna."
5,Indoor Antenna + Apple TV = Win!,"We live in New York, and cancelled our cable TV service years ago. After picking up the Apple TV, we decided to use an OTA indoor antenna to pick up local / breaking news and to watch the Mets / Yankees games. This antenna has been great - we actually picked up two of them and both, after some position fidgeting, have worked out great."
2,Not worth the trouble,"I bought this RCA basic Indoor antennae from Amazon. I live surrounded by brick and concrete buildings so could only pick up 6 - 8 channels and some of them would have lines and digital blocks running through them. When I finally had the antennae pointing in the exact position to get the best reception possible, which was not very good anyway, all it would take was a small bump and I'd lose my reception and all of the work I put into it. I could get ABC, NBC and the PBS stations but never CBS. I had to return it."
4,"Pulls in most of the Cleveland, OH stations OK","I can get most of the Cleveland, OH area stations OK with this antenna connected to a 32"" Sharp LCD HDTV in my basement with the antenna up in the basement window. I'm in an inner rung suburb of Cleveland only about 5-6 miles away from the stations. I can't get the WEAO (PBS, virtual channel 49), WVPX (ION, virtual channel 23) or WDLI (independent, virtual channel 17) channels with this antenna. To get those stations reliably, I'd most likely need a better, more expensive antenna in my attic. Or an outdoor antenna, which has a whole set of stuff to worry about- city permit(?), grounding, worry about lightning hit, need to securely mount to make it hold it during a storm or high winds."
3,It does the job,"This one works good, so if you are budget mined, it's a good choice. You have to do a lot of ups and downs to get it in a good position for some channels. It does work better in other rooms."
2,Just adequate,This is a basic antenna. It works as well on digital as it did 50 years ago with analog TV - Not well if you are more than a few miles from the television station.
3,Very Basic,"Inexpensive and very basic.It was easy to setup.I tend to have to adjust the rabbit ears frequently when flipping between particular channels which is annoying, but I did save money buying this.Nothing more to say."
2,Didn't work for me,Didn't catch any signals for me. Also the bulit is not very durable. The antenna broke as I was picking it up
1,cheap,It brought the first week i had it would not recommend it. made cheap bad reception. spend extra on better one
3,RCA Basic Indoor Antenna,I am a regular reviewer of products and I review by product functionality and value. For the price of this product and the fact it will perform well as it is designed as an antenna for television signal reception. Of course this product will need to be connected to a converter box to extract a useable signal. Thus 3 stars for today's use.
3,Basic product but works well.,"The product is priced low and that is just as well as this is just your basic indoor antenna. Nothing fancy to look at, but it delivers good reception."
2,Didn't work for me - Chicagoland,"I'm 20 miles from Sears tower (still can't bring myself to call it the Willis Tower) which is where all the Chicago area signals are beamed from. I was hopeful that this antenna work do the trick, but sadly it didn't pick up any channels. Antenna was placed about 10 feet from a South facing window (direction of Tower)."
4,It does what its supposed to do,It does what its supposed to do and considering the price it does it well. With it I'm receiving about 30 local network stations.
4,Great basic antenna,"This basic antenna has been working really well in my apartment located east of downtown LA. The VHF picks up all channels 2-13 crystal clear. The UHF loop picks up many channels from 18 to 63 very clear. I place the antenna near a window at an angle not blocked by apartment buildings to improve signal strength, and use it with a digital converter box on an old analog Sony TV. I would have rated 5 but because of the difficulty I had to insert the UHF loop into the base, I decided to rate it 4. I use a hard object to pound the UHF loop into the base because the insert holes are a bit too small; the workmanship on this product could use some improvement. However, the problem didn't affect the quality of the signal."
5,Works Great!,A few problems with set up intitially could not get reception. Once we determined how to program the channels on the TVit worked just fine. Love it. We get a clear crisp reception on our Toshiba 13 inch TV.
4,does what I wanted it to,"For the price I couldn't go wrong.Easy to set up,fairly compact (and when combined with digital tv box) brings in about 16 local channels."
4,"Works great, just make sure you run the scan!","If you don't run the channel scan on your tv, you're going to pick up very few channels, if any. This was easy to plug in via coax cable and after I ran the channel scan, I picked up like 30+ channels. Sometimes the sound comes out a little funny but the picture quality is always great."
4,"Can scan for quite a lot of channels, not very strong signal",I use it with an old TV and it can scan for quite a lot of channels but the signals are not so strong for some channels and no signal for a few channels probably because I live in an apartment not so high and surrounded by some higher apartments.
2,Could only get 2 out of 5 local channels,"I live 23 miles from several towers and for some reason I could only get 2 channels with this antenna. Actually I take that back, if I was standing on a chair, holding the antenna up I could get more, but that was a bit unreasonable.This antenna just didn't cut it for me. I moved on to better options like the Terk Indoor antenna."
2,Very basic indoor antenna.,"Item was as described in the listing. It's a very basic indoor antenna. It does help some, but I replaced it with a home made antenna from DIY plans I found on the Internet and about $5 worth of left over & scrap items I already had around the house."
2,Meh,"After reading all the reviews, everyone saying how wonderful this is and how many channels you pull in, I bought it. Sure I only paid a few bucks, but you get what you pay for.I set this high and next to a window, and living 30 minutes from Seattle I expected I'd pick up a few-abc NBC CBS but no- strangely I can only pick up ch13 out of Bellingham which is about 50 mins away? Oh and I Bring in 4 channels of 24 hour religion so I can go to church whenever I like and whatever I'm dressed in.Overall, I don't think it's worth the time unless you live IN a major broadcasting city. Not the outskirts.Still TV Less, I will continue to let the cable companies have it- streaming tv for me still-"
2,Cheap but doesn't work well,"I'm only able to pick up 2 of the 5 channels I want to pick up with this antenna, all channels I want are broadcast 6 miles away(very close) and I'm unable to get 3 of them. The ones I do get come in at about 60-70% signal strength with the occasional artifact on dropout(dropouts happens briefly and not often, artifacts are consistent about once a minute)."
2,"Even with direct sight lines to broadcasters, this one is spotty at best","In short, save your money. I've tried this antenna with both a DTV box, as well as with a digital TV with native tuner, and both times the results were frustrating. I placed the antenna near a window with direct sight lines to our local affiliates' antennae, most of them less than 3 miles away on a mountain top. The results were all over the board, with highly variable signal strength and regular pixelation and loss of signal.On a whim, I spent an extra $5 on an small, low-profile ""winged"" RCA antenna at walmart (also available at Amazon, the RCA ANT1050) and it made a WORLD of difference. All the channels are clear and consistent, and no more fiddling with 4 feet of rabbit ears that require near-constant repositioning.Rabbit ears are simply a design relic--there are too many better, lower-profile, easier designs out there today."
2,TV Antenna,It is broken when I got it. It cannot received some TV channels. but price is cheap. Design is good for small TV.
4,Antenna for Haier TV,"I bought this antenna to hopefully boost the signals coming into my Haier portable TV. For the money, this antenna helps the TV pull in signals alot better. Works great!!!"
5,Works great - better than the expensive antennas,"We have decided long ago to forgo cable. We live in a condo in San Diego near the beach, and the signal for many of the stations is obstructed by hills, an airport, and who knows what. The old Phillips antenna would lose reception for channels constantly, or sometimes not get a channel. We never got NBC at all. We tried buying an expensive antenna from Target, and no improvement.This $6 antenna ended up blowing the other two out of the water. No more lost reception, or fiddling with the antenna to try to get a channel. We get NBC, and all three NBC feeds. We can keep the antenna by the TV, not stretched out across the loveseat (because that's where the old antenna seemed to work best). Highly recommended."
3,good,"Good but not as robust as other antennas. I recommended this rabbit ears to all my tutors and students at TutorsTeach.com where I work as a tutor, but with caution."
4,Wow what a difference,"This antenna is your basic rabbit ear antenna. That means, if you buy it expecting poles of steel that can withstand a F5 tornado and some hurricane, DO NOT get it. These antenna extensions are like your basic radio antenna, very flimsy and easy to bend.But I will say, even though it is expanded to about 3 feet for each ear, I get super clear reception! I am very impressed with this. The only thing I can say bad about it, is that it can take a whole lot of space if you need to adjust for a signal, and the UHF loop was stupid hard to insert into the base (I couldn't even use the palm of my hand to push it in, I had to get a piece of metal to use as leverage and protect against hurting myself D:)I'm satisfied with it, hopefully it lasts a year or two or three :D"
3,You get what you pay for.,"For the price I paid, I got what it was worth. It is a very basic model. The pull out antenna's bend easy so watch out for that. Works OK for my needs. Shipping was good, got in the time stated, no problem there at all."
4,"Works, but you could spend only $1 for a similar antenna","I bought an antenna at a local dollar store in Phoenix that is very similar to this RCA unit. The UHF loop is shaped differently, and the RCA is heavier, but the reception is almost the same as the one that cost $1. There are two advantages to the RCA: you don't have to screw in the VHF dipoles if you are only going to watch digital, and the RCA has a longer cable, so it is easier to place and adjust in different areas. My advice is to check out local dollar stores if you're on a budget. Otherwise, the RCA unit is fine. You still need to adjust it for weaker stations, but for the most part I don't have to touch the antenna when I change channels."
4,It works,It does what it said it would do. Be sure you have a digital receiving television set or a analog receiving one with a converter. This antenna only receives the new digital format over-the-air. It will get you the channels you'd expect from free local TV.
4,works great,Having discovered this antenna saved me having to get cable in an extra room. I was able to get 40 channels!
1,very flimsey,"poor quality, really cheap made, broke right away just trying to ajust it. very flimsy, not worth the money at all."
5,I was skeptical....,but plugged it in and PERFECT major network channels in seconds. I'm canceling cable first thing tomorrow. The channels actually come IN BETTER than with cable. I can't believe I've been paying $100 for the few shows I watch. I'm ordering another for the bedroom (already tested there and works just as well!).
2,Not the best,"I purchased two of these, one for each tv in my house. First I will say they are affordable and the shipping was extremely fast. There's not much to setting them up; however, you have to pop in the smaller, square antenna to the base and you have to force it in. The first one went ok, got it set up easily. The second one broke during set up when I was trying to put the square antenna into the base and I had to throw it out and go buy another one locally. The one that didn't break works ok, there are several local channels that I can't receive and I am assuming it's because the antenna isn't strong enough but I don't really know. The other complaint I have is that when the pole antennas are all the way up and you have to move the square antenna to get better reception, it becomes off balance and will fall over. I would buy something else."
3,Probably depends on your area...,I wasn't able to pick up a single digital channel with this antennae and therefore obviously no HD channels either. I didn't do the research ahead of time to see where the various signals are coming from in my area... I just decided to get the cheapest one and see if I would get lucky. I would recommend doing some research first. Either that or only buy this one if you're already picking up a lot of the channels with your TV's built in antennae and just need that extra little boost to make it clearer.
3,Not a converter,This antenna will not work if you have an analog tv without a digital converter. Do not buy if you don't have a converter because it will not make your tv work.
1,Terrible build quality,"I could not assemble this antenna because the UHF loop didn't fit into the holes on the base. I could see that there were metal bits blocking the holes. I'm not the only person to have this problem -- I noticed at least two other reviewers had the same issue. It's also extremely lightweight and flimsy, and the VHF channel reception was poor to nonexistent. I returned it.My advice is to buy the ""The Leaf."" That's what I have now and it's great."
5,Could it really have been that easy all along?,"I bought this from Best Buy for $10.99 because I wanted it for the NFL today and even for that price it's a STEAL! I can't believe that for $5.99, here at Amazon, you can have this many HD channels for free. I get about 40 total stations and about 1/3 of those are in HD. When I say HD I mean crystal-clear, full-on high definition television. Of those 40 stations, about 35 are perfect and the remaining ones are a bit glitchy (i.e., poor reception?). According to the websites which detail what ""over the air"" are available in my area (Denver, CO) I'm getting every--single--one with this non-amplified, simple indoor antenna. So why would I spend 10x, 20x, 30x the price for a fancier one?I get all the local channels, FOX, QVC, PBS, MTV3, weather, and a smattering of other channels I haven't yet spent time watching. There are also about 8 stations in Spanish for those of you who are into that.Anyways, this is an absolute no-brainer for $5.99."
1,Didn't work at all,"This antenna did not work at all for me. I tried it in two locations, at my apartment in the city, and my parents' place in the suburbs. I picked up a total of 0 channels in both locations. Waste of $10."
2,Didn't work for me,I bought this and the Mohu leaf antenna after I dropped my cable company. It was $10 and the Mohu was $70 so I didn't want to buy two of those. The RCA didn't pick up all of my local channels but it did pick up the two with the strongest signals. It seems to work for some people but just not at my house.
2,cheap,the product looked good when i ordered it...upon opening it i was less than impressed. then i assembled it and one of the rabbit ears broke as i was screwing it in. no thanx.
3,basic indoor.,If you want THE basic for your tv. this is THE one. Very Light & ship very fast. Only problem if you dropped THE antena bends.
5,Mom without a dishwasher,"I use this drying rack daily for up to eight bottles and toddler cups. I'm always drying a combination of both. The nice thing is that they all fit. The lower holders get a bit crowded with 8 nipples and/or cup tops, but I just throw them on. If you only have six items on the lower portion, they fit very well, even nipples (Avent & Playtex). The front part works decently for the cup stoppers, and even a pacifier, but sometimes it needs to be tipped over and drained out so they don't sit in water. I don't think it was even made for them, but it works. I also like how the Munchkin bottle brush (my favorite) has a special spot in the drying rack too, so I always know where it is....Overall, it's a great item for the price."
5,Love the book!,Excellent research. Highly recommend for those who believe in the afterlife. There is great content and evidence that spirits remain with us after our earthly lives are over.
4,"Beautiful Watch, but item is not exactly as shown","Awesome delivery from Great Times. Watch is unbelievable, except don't purchase for multi-colored face. You can hardly see the different sections and they are opposite of the picture shown. The blue is as dark as the black. All and all though, a great purchase."
3,Not a ladies watch,This is a mans watch. Its really nice I don't mind the large dial but the band is way too long. I have skagen watch I bought at least 16 yrs ago and it still works great.
4,Good but...,"I got this as a package of 6 gangster movies. I really like the plot, similar to lock stock or snatch...BUT the camera work is awful. Maybe it's an indie/low budget thing, but the focus was bad. If you can deal with that, it's a good plot. Funny, surprises, twist, etc."
2,Bad acting,"Very bad acting in many parts, silly dialog. It trys to be witty like Pulp Fiction. But it is not. Avoid it and save some of your life."
4,Pretty Good Video,Well it took me 3 years until i finally liked the lightspeed rescue rangers getting this video helped me actually like this series most people dispised. This video has the first 3 episodes of lightspeed rescue and they're pretty darn good i'll admit it i'm 12 and when i was 9 i hated lightspeed rescue because all i ever liked was mmpr and let me tell you something all the power rangers series are very good exept ninja strom which was by far the worst series ever in my opinion.Get this video you'll watch it over and over again lightspeed rangers rule!!!
5,Easwaran is a great translator and commentator of Indian scriptures,"If you're not acquainted with Eknath Easwaran's translations and writings, go to the library and check him out. Wonderful translations and even more wonderful clarification and commentaries on all of the spritual classics from India."
5,A Timeless Classic,"This book is a beautiful masterpiece recounting personal tales of Siddhartha Buddha and his primary teachings. Even in today's world, overrun by materialism, infantilism, and fear, the Buddha's wisdom is self-apparent and just as relevant as it was ~2600 years ago. Easwaran's translations and commentary give great insight into meanings and breaking apart anything that might appear cryptic to the layman and those not already familiar with certain metaphysical ideas. Do your soul a favor and read this."
5,Great!,Wonderful book. Easwaran's translation is excellent and the chapter introductions are fantastic! The introduction is also extremely well written and very informative. I would recommend this book for all.
3,Enlightening (pun intended) reading,"The Dhammapada, a collection of sayings of the Buddha, is certainly a book filled with wisdom from a very wise man. It was great to read it and, as a Christian, to be able to appreciate his insights into human nature and into the nature of reality. Buddhist spirituality has always deeply impressed me and I was certainly not disappointed by reading this book. Easwaran's notes are generally very helpful, though his constant need to compare Christianity and Christ, neither of which he seems to understand very well, with Buddhism and the Buddha was a bit annoying at times. Overall, I think this is a book from which much insight can be gained and I recommend it to others as well."
2,Non-Buddhist translation of classic Buddhist scripture.,"The book is beautifully done. However, a careful reading of the text in comparison to other trnslations of the Dhammapada reveal differences that distort the meaning of the original text. For example, the translator renders verse 33 to read ""As an archer aims an arrow, the wise aim their restless thoughts..."", whereas a Theravada Buddhist monk's translation renders this line (as do two other translations consulted) to mean that ""Just as a fletcher [arrow-maker] straightens an arrow shaft, even so the discerning man straightens his mind..."" The translations are superficially similar, but the Buddhiust translation is obviously moire consistent with fundamental Buddhist thought. Moreover, the author's exposition of Buddhism appears to reflect his non-Buddhist viewpoint and bias, and perhaps ""political correctness""."
5,The Book of the books!,"If you decide to buy one book in your life, buy this one.It's the most warmful book. The one you need to open all others path. But it's the most difficult to put in practice, to transcend the teaching.If you want to know why you exist, it's a direct door, but to pass the door, you need to do steps one by one...the kind of book you read 2 pages a day.Wishing you to find this door, opening it and change your life deeply."
4,Just a good book,"I just liked this book. I like that the introduction has a brief on the four noble truths and the eightfold path, encouraging one to look deeper. I also like the explinations and or insites that come before the verses, not in-between the verses like some other publications which tend to muddy the lesson. Its just a very comfortable book to read and re-read time and again, and because of this I think the lessons unfold in a more natural fashion. No hurry, just relax."
4,I laughed so hard!,"I think that everyone who likes to laugh should read this book. I like how the author layed it out with the different kids saying their opinion and thoughts, like a page of a journal. Kelly Marie and Milo were probably my favorite characters. Kelly was obsessed with Henrietta and Milo wouldn't even call Henrietta by her name... he called he his Specimen! The end has a funny twist to it...but I can't tell! Read this book. It is soooo funny!"
4,Funny and engaging,"This book has action, sports, and humor, along with the points of view of some very different characters. My 5th grade class loves it, and the sports aspect appeals to the most kinesthetic readers, the ones that rarely sit still for a book."
1,Basha,"I like Gordon Korman books published before 1990. His books after 1990 are basha. This book is his worst (with the possible exception of ""Why did the Underwear cross the Road?"") None of the characters are funny or likeable. The plot seems contrived and some of it is just downright basha. Korman has definitely gone downhill since his Bruno and Boots books."
1,Sorry,"I just don't want my young adolescent reading about duds, saps,misfits & failures, even in the context of humor. There areplenty of other good reads out there."
4,Backpack Sprayer,"It works great. Easy to pump & nice wide strong spray. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is because the arm straps did not allow for enough adjustment to fit my XXL shirt size. I ended up changing out the shoulder straps & using rachet straps in their place. Besides that, it is very easy to operate & I would highly recommend it."
2,Sparks and electrical smoke?,"I have to say this was the most dramatic death of an electronic component I have ever witnessed. I've had the TV for almost 4 years with no complaints. Last night is started cracking and popping, then shot a bunch of smoke and sparks out of the power supply. I waited a day and plugged it back in... same problem. I guess it's dead. The part (if I could find one is stock) is $200.I don't know how long a TV is supposed to last these days but I expect more from a name brand company. Oh well."
5,Great Picture and High Def. Too!,I bought this LCD screen a while back and it is in excellent condition. The one I bought is this same exact model. The remote is simple and the features are easy to use. It is very basic and great for everything. It's a good screen and I love mine. It's a good one if you're looking!
3,Canister,"Seals great, good quality.. Major issues during shipping. Amazon did not package product properly everything came broken the first time. With Amazon quick response I received a new package."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I knew these were going to be small because of a review I read and was actually in the market for small ones, so that didn't bother me. The first set I got- Broken. The second set- Broken. I'm getting a refund this time. Amazon did an awesome job getting them here though. Only took the replacement 2 days to get here."
3,Function Follows Form With This Canister Set,"Great looking, these canisters seal well and are easy to keep clean. We mainly kept them because of the way they look. When it comes to function, they are not the greatest because they are small, small, small compared to other sets I have owned over the years. The smallest of the four is practically worthless for storage - we use it as an oversized sugar bowl and take it back and forth to the kitchen table when serving coffee. If your goal is to store adequate quantities of flour, sugar, coffee beans, etc. on your conter top, then do not bother with these. However, if you just want something ""purty,"" these are really nice."
2,AM I HALLUCINATING?,"As I go through the full track list, I don't find the end of the 2nd Act anywhere... Is it possible it is not there??? If so... WHY???????? I couldn't possibly considere this a serious work, given that unforgivable fault... I wouldn't by it anyhow!!!"
1,Boring...,"I agree with the reviewer who called this a real stinker. I have to suppress a lot of yawns while listening to this recording. There are so many other beautiful performances and recordings so avoid this and don't waste your money like I did, being misled to think this was beautiful like its CD cover only.There is no immediacy nor vitality in this performance. It's like listening to a concert at the far end of the concert hall instead of the front seats. It's like listening to music in a cavern, a well, the music sounds distant and ""small"" in staging. Also, to me, the music sounds unnecessarily ponderous and meandering. After listening a while, one easily get emotionally detached and bored. Just comparing this to a lesser known recording by Zubin Mehta/Israel Philharmonic/Decca (highlights, sampler) would instantly show the great difference and what I mean. The latter is so much clearer, richer, detailed, immediate, evocative, moving, dynamic, beautiful, etc...Give this a miss!"
5,Dutoit has done it again!,"It seems that no matter what work or composer Charles Dutoit conducts, the result always yields a solid performance by the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. This Swan Lake, in particular, is an audiophile's delight: superb orchestral hall acoustics, and wonderful playing by the orchestra that is both thoughtful and soulful. You just might find a tear coming to your eye as the final notes bring down the curtain of this extraordinary performance of what is, arguably, the world's most famous ballet."
4,Very crisp and technically impressive,"Although others have rated this lower for what they claim is a lack of color, I believe that the marvel in this recording comes from the precision in Montreal's playing. Fine, Dutoit may be harsh on the musicians, but his demands are well met. As far as the recording itself is concerned, the mic setup captures the accoustics of the hall extremely well and all sections of the orchestra are heard at appropriate levels. Finally, this recording continues the quality line of classical CD's that Decca/London has produced."
3,Not John Harvey's Best,"This mystery has good character development and provides an interestingsense of police culture. However, the mystery itself was weak.The story is about a kidnap and murder in the who-done-it genre. Iwas disappointed with the loose ends and lack of depth to the story. Isuggest starting with another one of John Harvey's books."
1,no popcorn. just an empty paper tub,"I was wanting the act2 brand popcorn tubs because they come with popcorn seeds and make great Xmas gifts when u put DVDs in them and wrap up. Unfortunately they are out of stock. So I tried these and they are nothing but empty paper tubs. They don't say they come with popcorn but they don't say they don't either. Not very clear on sales discription. Could have saved all of us some time. Get the act brand from amazon... when they have it. If your microwave has a ""popcorn"" button, then it works with the tubs on when to automatically stop and u don't have to pour into a bowl. Great for home theater experience. Amazon rocks!!!"
4,Good for 20 miles,Just hooked up this antenna with my digital converter box to my old TV and I have clear pictures on all channels within range. Most of my towers are 20 miles away in the same direction. UHF and VHF. The others are UHF 5 miles away.
5,Great little antenna,"We purchased another RCA antenna from a local TV repair shop for $60. It worked well, so we decided to try this one because it has even more DBs. Our digital reception is now majorly better. It is for both VHF and UHF, easy to hook up, and easy to adjust. I would definitely recommend this little gem."
1,Weak Signal and Poor Performance,"I live in a western suburb of Chicago and needed to pull in NBC to watch the Olympics. I have an old analog TV, so had to get a digital-to-analog TV converter in addition this antenna.However, this antenna (with amplifier) was unable to pull in NBC (Ch 5 - very poor signal) or CBS (Ch 2 - no signal). Channels 7 or higher were okay at best.In desperation, I went up in the attic to find my dads old 1960's rabbit ear antenna. Sure enough, hooked it up and it pulled in Ch 5 very strong (same location as this RCA). For some reason I didn't think this old antenna would work, which is why I bought this RCA.Unfortunately, this RCA ANT1251R didn't do the trick and was beat by simple technology over 50 years old! Sorry RCA, zero stars for you."
2,disapointing antenna,"I am about 23-25 miles from Sears and Handcock towers where chicago tv are broadcast from. A 2nd story bedroom facing east, toward the buildings. The antenna did pick some some additional stations vs the old rabbit ears, but not the main CBS and PBS stations. Plus some of the other ones show and do not show. Talking about the digital stations here. Was expecting a lot more considering it is amplified. Would not recommend it. Intend to try the Terk antenna."
2,Moderate,"RCA has a lower grade model(ANT301) that has a slightly better performance than this one. I bought this model based on performance specs provided, only to end up using ANT301 again. I feel I wasted my money on this one."
2,"not worth it, nothing extra","Don't get me wrong, this antenna works. But the RCA 121 Antenna works just as well for $12, so I just recommend that one."
5,good hdtv antenna,"it's a great hdtv antenna, third purchased for my family,very good deal and of course better than the other brand."
1,Waste of money,"It may pull in a few channels for you, but I absolutely guarantee that a coax adapter and two coat hangers will give you more. With my coat hanger set-up I was getting a signal strength of 54 out of 100 watching pbs kids. Unhooked the hangers and plugged this thing in and got a whopping 17 at best."
2,Not worth the extra money!!,"This is the first amazon review I have written!! I bought this antenna at best buy (on their suggestion) because I am having trouble picking up NBC in Springfield IL. It is broadcast in Decatur, which is about 40 miles away. This antenna did not get me any more channels than my other antenna (the cheapest one BB sold). It actually made some channels come in worse! Also, the cord is really short so moving it closer to the window wasn't an option. I ended up returning it. Don't buy it if you are trying to pick up channels that aren't very close. Stick with the traditional antenna instead."
1,Low power,The power boost on this model is totally ineffective based on our usage. I use it in a basement room beside a full window where it fails to draw in the signal of the local PBS station. That's a big disappointment. We get good signals with it on all other major stations in our area -- without using the power option.
1,About as good as a coat hanger,"It seems that when buying an antenna, cheaper is better. This is not cheap enough. The amplifier turns on the light, but I don't think it does anything else."
2,"This Antenna only receives VHF channels, no UHF channels.","I bought this from Amazon because of the good reviews.I search my local channels on fcc.gov website, that I should get about 30 channels with VHF and UHF together.[...]It was actually arrived very fast (Thanks to amazon prime shipping service), however, it only receives 5 Hi-VHF channels with my Sony HDTV, like ABC, FOX in my area, and none of UHF channels, like NBC & CBS, is ever receive no matter how I positioned this antenna. I buy this because I want to watch Olympics on NBC. Too bad, it doesn't work for me.I am going to try another one, and it will be returned to Amazon tomorrow."
4,Great product with clear picture,"I was kind of worried purchasing an indoor antenna however, I was quickly relieved after I went through the set up on my TV and my channels appeared. Great clear picture. Exactly what I ordered!"
2,Same as $9 antenna,"I bought the $9 basic indoor antenna here: http://www.amazon.com/RCA-ANT111-Basic-Indoor-Antenna/dp/B000HKGK8Y/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1300387419&sr;=8-2 00 It's a good antenna. The only problems I had with it are regular problems you have with antennae - picture flaking out, can't get a signal.I thought I'd try this $40 antenna. The Best Buy associate said it'd be stronger and I'd get more channels. Nope! Not only did I not get any more channels, the reception was exactly the same as the $9 antenna.Maybe it works for some people, and maybe the reviewers here didn't try the $9 one first. I think it's a waste of good money because the amplification feature offered nothing over the basic antenna. Plus you have to waste electricity having it plugged in.Stick with their basic antenn."
4,good buy,it works we have owned ours for at least 6 months and even when my boys broke it. it still works. it wont die.
4,Decent Digital Antenna,"I recently purchased this amplified antenna for my 40"" tv at home. I found this to provide a much stronger signal than my rabbit ear antenna that i had before. It isn't perfect, in that during storms and high winds it will still have choppy picture from time to time. It still is a great antenna for what I need. I have recently purchased another to use with my 52""."
4,Look old,"It looks old to me,( some dust on the antenna)but may be just because they store for a long time. I get 5 channel out of it"
1,DON'T EXPECT A LOT FROM THIS AMPLIFIED ANTENNA,"THIS ANTENNA DID ABSOLUTLY NOTHING FOR MY MOTHER'S TV.... I TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET A BETTER SIGNAL/PICTURE FROM THE NEW ANTENNA WITH NO LUCK.. HAVING SAID THAT, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THIS ANTENNA WON'T WORK FOR YOU BUT BE ASSURED IT WILL NOT WORK IN ALL SITUATIONS..IT IS ALSO INTERESTING THAT THIS REVIEW DOES NOT LET YOU RATE (WITH A STAR RATING) THE ""PICTURE QUALITY"" AS AN ""ATTRIBUTE"" THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REASONS FOR BUYING AN AMPLIFIED ANTENNA........."
2,STINKS !!!!!!!!!!!,THE STANDARD EXTENSION ANTENNA OUT PERFORMS THIS RCA INDOOR AMPLIFIED TV ANTENNA !!!!!!!!!!!! THIS ANTENNA IS NO GOOD AND WASTE OF MONEY !!!!!!!!!!!
2,antannae,"didnt work in my bottom floor condo. got 5 channels, two in english. no high def.. not recommended for everyone"
2,Less Than Expected Performance,"The antenna simply did not pull in as many channels as my old one did, even in its decrepit condition. I went out and bought an amplified bar-shaped antenna by GE that works just fine."
4,Damned Kids,"Whisper is a definite sleeper movie that will have you wondering while watching just what the heck you've gotten yourself into. An 8-year old boy steals the show in this thrilling supernatural horror. Don't read any detailed reviews, don't even read the back of the cover for a synopsis. Simply get the movie and settle in for a suspenseful tale full of wonderful twists and turns. Great story, better than average acting and a damned smart kid sporting a preppy sweater-vest over a crisp white shirt buttoned to the hilt. And You know what that means.If you know your horror, you'll sense the signs of evil lurking at every turn as you savor the tension. If you're not a horror movie buff, the soundeffects alone might cause you to jump out of your skin. But do watch, there's little if any blood splatter and no flesh eating zombies. Just a murderous game of psychological warfare being played out to the climaxing end."
3,Unauthorized Damien a Sequel,"WHISPERS is just another offshoot of the whole OMEN cycle--and it's a darn good offshoot. I liked the entire concept of kidnapping the Kid from Hell & holding him (it?) for ransome. Needless to say, the criminals are ill-equipped to handle Satan's Spawn. The Little Bugger knows exactly what buttons to push & strings to pull. I don't want to give anything else away. A great film for a rainy night. Most ages, nothing too graphic."
2,so-so,This movie was actually better than I had expected. I bought it not knowing quite what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. I am a fan of Josh Holloway and was pleased to see he made more than just a cameo in the film. The plot is pretty easy to predict but overall not bad.
5,Pretty Good...,"This was a good flick, yes it was a bit predictable...it been done before. However, it was still a interesting movie, little horror/action good acting.Its worth your time."
2,Ho-Hum,"A not very scary Omen rip-off. Tons of loose ends. The only redeeming feature is getting to look at Josh Holloway of ""Lost."" Get somebody else to rent it for you. Best when viewed through beer goggles."
3,Passable knock off of The Omen,"In this terror film, the most inept band of kidnappers in world history abducts the child from hell, an eight year old adopted boy from a very wealthy family in New England, who's in fact the antichrist or something. One by one, the kidnappers will pay for their deed. The film looks like an unauthorized knock off of The Omen, and while mildly entertaining, is hardly a great film. Made with a no name cast (except perhaps for Michael Rooker, who twenty years ago has a cult hit in Henry, Portrait of a serial killer) the good scenery from New England in winter and a good hand in the directing adds a little to this passable movie. Just don't take it too seriously."
4,Unexpected twist,"*SPOILERS*I see people comparing this to the Omen, but the only similarity is that there is a boy involved. The story is nothing like the Omen and slowly works its way to a surprise ending. The story really centered around an abduction and ransom for money. The horror end of it is revealed over time as it becomes apparent that the boy is something more than the average kid. I thought it was very creative. As far as similarities to other horror movies, there are only so many settings one can create. It is easy to compare this with many movies but I did not find it cliche' in any way. It was quite unique since it was an area that hasn't been covered exactly in this way. The boy was not represented to be the ""devil"" but something else. If you like religio/horror types of movies you will like this one. The boy in the movie does an excellent job of acting as do all the actors. I thought it was well worth watching."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"I chose this little known film for two reasons. First, for a B-Movie, the cast is terrific! Second, the best horror films are the ones with evil, sadistic, kids. What's scarier than a kid who goes around killing people? In Whisper, David is a kid of fortune, but very introverted. At his birthday party, he's kidnapped and held from ransom, but he's not really the prisoner, they are! I tried to like this movie, but honestly I didn't. The cast was excellent, but the film moves very slowly, very little actually happens, and when it does, you already knew it was coming. It wasn't an awful movie, and this cast is certainly appealing, but something just doesn't click. I'd avoid this one if I were you."
3,A Decent Attempt to Apply the Insights of Post-Sructuralism,"This book produces nothing too surprising if you're familiar all the recent post-structuralist critiques of historiography, social science, and the study of the Middle East and Islam. Nothing will be too surprising to you if you are familar with the thought. However, if you are not familar with these trends, this brief book serves as a good introduction since this is about as lucid and comprehensible as works of such a predisposition tend to get. The author shows an excellent exposure to recent post-structuralist thought and english literature on the Middle East and Islamism; however, his engagement with Islamism leaves much to be desire as he apparently knows neither modern Arabic nor Persian as his bibliography and use of texts demonstrates. A much better and much more critical work,however, has been written by Aziz al-Azmeh entitled ISLAM AND MODERNITIES."
2,Magic Jumbo Shades,Last time I purchased them they came in a nice sleeve. These are awkward and only have a band to wrap around them.
3,Eh,"I was quick to purchase this item as I saw the great review. However, in my own personal experience, the shades do little to keep out the heat from the car. The average temperature that I live in currently is 90-95F, and my car's steering wheel and gear stick still burns. Not sure if the material of the shade is good enough.."
1,Waste of money.,Wire popped out of the edge within 2 months of buying. It was a real waste of money. I can't use it anymore because the little metal wire is pretty sharp and can also scratch my interior!
3,the sunray of florida stills burns my car,"this thing looked promising with the image and the product description, but it rarely blocks out the sun and the ray, the car still feels the heat, and when I touch the inside, it is hot like a pan on a stove. While the shades don't contain that kind of temperature. It merely slightly utilizes its function, what can I say, I am still willing to use it since I don't have the time and money to look for another one. At least it is better than none."
2,I threw it away after 2 weeks.,"I've had these types of shades for years. I even bought my dad one. My would not fold the way it should of after the first time. It was frustrating! I just ended up throwing it in the backseat, and because it didn't really fit my windshield, I just tossed it and got the crinkly one from a gas station for the same price. It's not as frustrating!"
1,Cheap and Flimsy,"I got these sunshades because I used to have similar ones back in the 90's and I loved them. The accordion shade I have now is cumbersome to fold inside a small car (in this case a Honda Civic), and I remembered the little oval ones being easier to collapse. Plus, they fit in the pocket in the driver door - whereas the accordion type has to be maneuvered into the rear floorboard.The fabric in THESE shades is more like a type of tinfoil than fabric. Anywhere it wrinkles it creases and the metallic coating starts to flake away. Without the metallic coating, the screen blocks no light at all - making the shades increasingly ineffective. They should have skipped the metallic coating, used instead a thicker material - perhaps block out lining material like they use in curtains?Anyway - not worth the $$$, even at just $8. My $4 old accordion shade is more effective."
2,These are NOT the reflective shades,"I ordered these because the page suggested they would be the aluminized reflective shades, but what came was the nonreflecting plasticized cloth shades. They are much hotter (but durable), and you can get them at any auto parts store. ""Styles May Vary"" should really say ""Product May Vary"", since a ""Style"" would be some printing, slogan or pattern on the shade.So I went to Wal Mart and found them on the shelf. Apparently there is no indication on the package which kind it contains, so you have to visually inspect it before buying. In any case, the reflective sheet is very fragile, so that may be why they are so hard to find. I actually reinforce them around the edge with clear tape, then they last about 3 years."
4,Basux Magic Jumbo Sunshade,Seems to keep the car cooler but am having trouble in how to fold it up (didn't come with instructions).
3,two separate pieces,"i agree with the other reviewer that they're very flimsy. it hasn't even been 24 hours and one corner is bent already(hopefully only semi-permanent), but they do get the job done -- the size is nice in that it completely blocks out the sun.you get what you pay for. they'll work for now."
5,Summer,There were so many days this hot summer that I would get into my car and my black leather seats would burn me. But the magic shield My car cool and the leather as well great product.
3,sun shade,looks ok for intended purpose. takes a bit of practice to twist for storage. They do not quite cover full size truck window but are fairly close
2,CHEAP ITEM,Jsut used the product for roughly about a week and the refletive silver is already cracking. The size is just right but doesnt seem to block much heat. Would return but not worth wasting time to pack and send back. Very dissappointed.
1,Flimsy rubbish,"Folding is very tricky - you're supposed to be able to fold and roll them up but they just bend, and then they don't fit flatly against the windshield any more. Right into garbage after one use. Honestly I'm a careful and meticulous guy and these are just hopeless. So much so that I'm driven to write my first review ever."
1,Horrible,"Everything started out well. It did help a little to keep the car cooler. Here is where the ""BUT"" comes in. I am extremely careful when closing this product and putting it away. However the other day when attempting to fold it up as I usually do the wire that runs around the outside of the shade snapped. Now I only have one that actually works. I have not contacted the company since I have had for a couple of months and I don't want to hear that I have to pay shipping and handling again."
1,ok,"Product is made of very thin material. It has multiple pin holes in it. It does help keep the inside of my car cooler, I just don't think it's going to last very long because of the small holes."
3,disapointed with one item,Ordered 3 of the windshield sunshades and one of them has a worn-out hole in the cloth covering the wired edge. Considering that I've only been in possession of this sunshade for a month or so at the most...not too happy that it's ripped on one of the edges already.
4,"Excellent size and fit, but a little thin.","I bought one of these for my 2010 Honda Accord. It is certainly a great size, big enough so it fills the entire windshield, but it folds away easily and small.The only negative is that it is a little thin. I can actually see light through it, so I wonder how reflective and effective it is. My previous shade, which was over 10 years old was thicker and let no light shine through.Hopefully this one is just as effective, we will see through the hot southern summer."
5,No complaints at all.,"Product was as-advertised and was just what I had been looking for -- a plain-colored, packable large-size sun shade for the windshield in my van or station wagon (my local auto parts stores carry only the regular size which was too small.) Note that this sun shade is not all that big even though it's called a ""jumbo"", and it's two separate pieces, not one-piece. I still prefer this packable type of sun shade (or ""magic"" shade) and find it more convenient than the fan-fold type which sometimes require suction cups to stay on the windshield.The item arrived in less than a week even with the cheaper gound shipping. Overall very satisfactory."
5,"Low price, good quality.","Very effective. Blocking the sun light and keep the temperature lower in your car. Yes, it is still very warm after using this, of course. But it is much much better than just leaving your car under the sun. I'm totally satisfied."
1,Useless,"I had a spring type sun shade in my other cars. My Honda Fit has a much larger windshield, so I ordered first the Jumbo shade 28X31 which wasn't large enough, came in two panels and was nearly impossible to fold, then I ordered Super Jumbo magic sunshade 31 x 38 inches http://www.amazon.com/Basix-Magic-Shade-Sunshade-Styles/dp/B000G72UOQ (out of stock at Amazon) don't bother looking. The Super Size shades are even harder to fold, I gave up and they are sitting unfolded in my garage.Yes, I have a garage at home, and drive to work and park in a garage, but on a hot day I would like to pop open a sun shade to cool my car, but these products are lousy compared to the old ones that fit the standard car windows."
2,The jumbo seems to big for small models,"I probably pick the wrong size. Yes! Folding is a big problem, unless you get the tricky part of it. It does not keep the car any cooler in my opinion. The steering wheel was still pretty hot during the summer... Maybe it would have been hotter... I do not know."
5,Wonderful Sounds of the Australian Bush,This cd is a great introduction to all the australian birdsongs. If you have been to Australia for a holiday brings back all the bush memories. This couple have a great collection of all australian bushsounds. Highly recommend.
4,indoor discus,"Flies well, doesn't mark gym floor -- so it's workable. My only detriment is that one was a soft as the eraser on a pencil and the other hard. Why such variability in structure?"
2,Bad Buttons,"I installed this and it worked fine for awhile. Then one button failed so the whole thing is worthless. Why make a nice chime and use crappy buttons?No replacement available and no customer service.Oh, save your paperwork. The unit has no model # on it or even the manufacturer's name.Nada.zip! Hows that for a dodge? Shame on them!!"
2,cheap and defective,this item is very cheaply constracted. From the 2 buttons only one worked no matter of the jumper settings. The buttons didn't look very waterproof if exposed to weather. I do not recommend this product.
4,Affordable Solution,"Taking care of a sick friend, I needed an inexpensive way for him to signal me if he needed anything. Set this up with the button on the nightstand, and it worked perfectly. There are options that don't take so many batteries, and after using this I think I might have paid a bit more for one of those. Batteries are expensive these days. (Base unit used three D-size.)"
1,Piece of junk!,"The doorbell was intalled and worked for half the day. Then I got a call saying the bell would no longer ring. I went up there to check it out but button # 1 would not ring, button # 2 did ring. Changed the batteries around but button # 1 still would not work. Put everything back like it was before and only Button # 2 worked for a couple hours, then it died. Not good quality, pass on this item. I can say this though, Amazon backed up this sale and I did not have one issue with the return."
3,Only one of the buttons worked.,"This item comes with two buttons which would have been perfect for my son's house apartment. We planned to put one at the entrance and one at the connecting door; but only one of the buttons worked. We got a new battery, but it still didn't work."
4,Works,For the price it works just fine. The front and back ringer have a different sound. The stickers do not hold so you need to screw the ringers in.
2,story great format disappointing,bought this book for my kindle. it was full of typos. was very disappointed. first problem with kindle books that i have had.
2,TOO DARN SAD!!!,"I like an engrossing, good story but not one that makes me cry practically from the start. I put it down and won't finish it."
4,The Promise,I enjoyed reading this book as I do most books written by Danielle Steel. Would recommend it to others too.
3,Reading was good but wish it were hardback,"I've read most of Danielle Steele's books, had this book in hardback years ago and purchased it to complete my collection. Read was a good one."
3,Horribe Editing!,"This was one of the first books I purchased for my new Kindle. The typo's, left out words, etc., made it very hard to follow the flow of the publication. I found myself getting very angry and was wondering if all Kindle downloads would be this way. Fortunately, this is the only book I have uncovered that has had such problems."
3,"I Am Still Reading, But","Why in the world are there so many grammatical and spelling errors in this book? Is the real copy this horrible or is it just the Kindle version? The story seems okay but it is getting ridiculous when ""right"" is spelled ""rigjht"". It makes the author look dumb. I read The Cottage too and it was not grammatically correct. Punctuation was missing, misspelled words, words used in the wrong context, and run on sentences. I love the story lines so far but this is the last Danielle Steele novel I will buy until they fix the issues. Very disappointing since I paid for these books.**Edit** 9/21/2010 I just finished this book amd I have to say that it was easily one of the best stories I have read. So romantic. The characters were so likeable or able to be hated. I would have loved to have given this book a 5 but the typo's were too much."
4,"Evans, GA",Always enjoy Danielle Steel even the second time around..I am always waiting for a new one to come out. Hope it will be soon!
5,Love Love Love,"The Promise was the first love story I recall reading as a young girl.Uncanny, how beloved messages that resonate with our soul's dreams and desireswill stay in the unconscious even if we don't think we remember them, and somehow,magically, weave themselves into our lives.Uncanny! Love is...."
1,Unrealistic,"I thought this book was romantic but incredibly unrealistic. SPOILER ALERT: It seems rather absurd that Michael never finds out that Nancy is alive. Did he never read a newspaper article about the crash? Did his best man ever read the newspaper report? Did he never try to find her grave? The author never tells us what the world at large thinks happened. Etiher it is generally thought that she died (in which case the mother would have had to get the hospital to fake a death certificate, etc, and produce a body to bury) or else the rest of the world thinks she's alive (which, again, seems unrealistic that Michael wouldn't find out or one one of his friends.)"
4,Best book by Danielle Steel,"Great book. I could'nt put the book down. Very suspenseful. Loved the ending, it was great!"
4,GREAT,"This was the first Danielle Steele book I ever read. I enjoyed it so much. It touched me with the different emotions that we as humans experience. Love, anger, betrayal, forgiveness. This was my first taste of her books and I have read just about all of them. I am so pleased, that while the people and plots are different, that the theme of the emotions we go through are similar in all her books."
5,If you read ONE Danielle Steel book... Read this one!,"I've been skeptical of Danielle Steel all my reading life. After all, she seems to release new books like how some people dish out business cards! I didn't pick up this book until a friend ranted and raved about it. Well, this book made me a fan. My first DS book and she won me over. This book just got me by the heart and clamped on it. Wow, this is a wonderful book and I'd recommend it to anyone, especially anyone who's weary of Daniel Steel. I love the story of Nancy and Michael from page 1 and I was glued to the pages till the very end. And I loved the ending, tears just sprung up and rolled down my cheeks. I read the ending 5 times and wished it didn't end.This is a truly a masterpiece.Julianne"
4,A very toching story about what a promise really means.,"This is for anyone who likes love stories. It's about a young couple who has been involved for a couple of years and plan to be married. This is true love. The love worth making a promise about, which they have. They made a promise to each other that nothing would come between them. On their way to get married, they were involved in a bad accident. Michael not too seriously hurt, but Nancy almost died. Nancy being persuaded from Michael's mom to break all ties with him, and in return she would take care of all medical/living expenses until she was fully recovered. Life was miserable for both Michael and Nancy. I encourage you to get the book and find out how this story ends, it's well worth the reading.The book gives great details on what/where the settings take place. Read it, it's worth the time."
3,Not a New Novel,"I have read so many that I can't remember the titles any more. Hence, when I want to purchase one for my kindle I check the publication date to help determine whether I might have read it before. I was reading The Promise and it kept seeming to be so familiar, but I checked and rechecked the pub date which said it was new. I figure out that was the KINDLE pub date and that it was a reissue of an older novel - which, of course, I had read. I wish the listings on Amazon would state clearly that a book is a reissue, whether from another format or whatever.I would of appreciated knowing this before purchasing a book that I read already."
5,The Promise,It was an excellent novel. Couldn't put it down. Danielle Steele always writes interesting novels. I truly enjoyed this book.
4,promise,I enjoyed this book. I really thought it was great when she decided they were going to give the baby to their kids who couldn't get pregnant.. the book kept me interested to keep reading to see what was going to happen next.
1,The promise,"Wonderful love story that has endured through time. This novel was also made into a fantastic movie. Have been looking for that movie to watch, again."
4,Good read,"Enjoyed reading. It is a little dated, but still a good read. There was enough detail to empathize with the characters."
3,Good But not Great and Get rid of the FOUL language!,"The premise of the story is profound. Unfortunately, the execution is shallow. In typical Steel style the ending was wrapped up abruptly in a two page chapter that left this reader dissatisfied. And can't Miss Steel write about normal people...people who aren't rich.....people who aren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth?? Can't she write without using dirty and obscene language?? All that aside, Steel could create masterpieces but, alas, this is not one of them. It's o.k. but not great. But then, reading Steel is a guilty pleasure and one doesn't need to look for great literature. Great beach reading."
2,Too predictable!,"This book appears to have been quickly written, the storyline was extremely predictable and dull! There were so many typos in the book I wonder how it passed any editing. This book was an extreme disapointment and now I remember why I quit reading her books a year ago. She needs to come up with some unique material and take some time to produce a quality book."
3,Danielle Steel Book,"I love these books and I'm always buying them. The shipping took a little long to get to me. I order a lot off line and am not use to anything taking two weeks to get to me. Other than that, I this is my favorite book I've been looking for and it was in good shape too! Would probably buy again!"
3,THOUGHT PROVOKING,"This book is a very interesting description of the financial and banking history of the western world. Although the view is prospectively conspiratorial, it causes the reader to wonder about the transparency and stability of our financial system."
5,The root of our problems in the U.S. today:,"If any American wants to understand, really understand, what is wrong with our political system, why things are so difficult, why there is so much crime, and why our national philosophy is in moral decay, then they must understand that the root of these effects are manifest through our economic policies - the hidden policies which this book exposes the creation of. The root of evil is the choices men make and the elite manifest their evil through our medium of exchange. If you can understand this, then you will have begun to grasp what we need to do as a nation to reverse what these few altruistic elite have started. To further understand the affects this book hints toward, you must read the book titled ""Money-The Greatest Hoax on Earth"" by Merrill Jenkins Sr. and ""Bashed By The Bankers"" by Bryon Dale."
3,Comment on technical quality,"Just a quick note on the technical quality of the book which I find quite poor: Lots of formatting problems, words not separated by a space, and no table of content (reading it on a smartphone - but that should have no impact)."
4,Secrets of the Federal Reserve,"This is a great book so far, since I haven't finished it. It is obvious that the author took great efforts to do his research and to document what he says. I have a feeling that this book is the one from which all other investigative books on the Fed are based."
5,Exactly as Advertised,My book was exactly as described and arrived promplty. The only thing I could wish to change is sturdier packaging to protect the product. I'd shop with this person again!
3,Question,I am making the loving hearts afghan and have done something wrong or cannt figure out how to connect my strips of motifs together. I honestly think you left out that step. Please help.
4,crochet,"I had this book before but misplaced it. I got it off of Amazon, a hard back book, for less than what I paid at the hobby store for a paper back. love it"
3,Tends to stick to itself when fresh & crumbles when dry,"Conducted class project for 2nd graders to make carousel animals with pencil inserted into middle of animal body. Animal legs tended to stick to other legs, causing frustration among the students. Neck & head of horses & zebras tended to sag downward. Once pencil was carefully inserted, animal tended to sag in half. Had to use masking tape to hold poses. When dry, children painted their animals with tempera paint. Clay feels spongy when dry, but ears, legs, etc. can easily be broken off."
3,Works in a pinch,I needed a lot of something clay-ish that would have to dry very quickly overnight. This was quite marshmellowy material that still remained a little spongy after 24 hours. It did what I needed it to do for a children's craft but it didn't achieve the hardness I desired.
5,Can't go wrong with this stuff!,"My kids love this stuff, the smaller individual packets are perfect an make sure there is no waste."
5,Two lovers caught up in history,"I had the great pleasure to read Rod Randall's ""La Paraclete"" and didn't want the book to end. He infuses the book with insightful spiritual issues, incendiary at the times, and still pertinent to the world today. As each chapter moves the story towards its inevitable conclusion, we are faced with the lives and emotions that the characters experienced. The events are captured in stark and often iambic prose. Whether you're a newcomer to the tale, or a buff of the Abelard and Heloise legend, this book will completely engage you in their lives. If you're looking for an excellent starting point to their story, a nice summer romance, or an incisive examination of religious manias, look no further. Five out of five stars."
3,Only Satisfactory,"The stairs and perches are smooth and offer no traction to help in climbing. I covered them all with sandpaper perch covers, which helped. The steps are also a bit far apart for my cockatiel to climb easily, and the top step is too close to the top perch so he has to duck his head to squeeze through. A toy on the top perch would have been nice. The food and water cups are fine. The base wipes off easily. The playpen is colorful, which I've read that cockatiels like. It's satisfactory but I wish I had gotten a playstand that rolls around on casters, has toy hook(s) on the top perch, and a ladder from the base to the perch."
3,disappointing,201 is exactly the same as it was on tvall you get is the fussbut you don't really find out what all the fuss was about...
5,DVD#3,The product arrived on time and was just the right price to add to my collection . Thank you for the prompt service .
4,Censored,"Be aware before you buy this, episode 201 is censored just as it was when it aired originally. Every time some one says Muhammad, it's beeped out, and at the end, Kyle's entire ""I learned something today"" speech is beeped out. Comedy Central and Paramount, You are LAME."
1,"The ""real"" comedy central - Viacom","Maybe Comedy Central is actually operated and governed by the Islamic Terrorists or much of the stock is owned by some!!? Why else would they violate a constitutional right of free speach and expression? Why is it that we can produce documentory after documentory of muslim and islamic fanatics that use terrorism as a weapon? We show them training and burning flags and stating how they want to kill americans. Yet, CC (actually VIACOM) singles this out as something to censor. Viacom owns paramount pictures, which no doubt makes and distributes films that reach way beyond SP's OBVIOUS poke at the humor of all the screwed up things in the world. Maybe letters to Viacom's Execs are a thought?Sumner M. Redstone(Executive Chairman)Philippe P. Dauman(President & CEO)South Park as a show gets an across the board 5 stars from me.This rating here is for Viacom/CC. 1 star cuz i cant use 0"
1,Don't buy it!,"I support Matt and Trey and applaud their irreverent parodies of controversial subjects. The fact that comedy central has its head so solidly and intractably up its own ass regarding episodes 200 and 201 (and now even the Super Best Friends episode) forces me to say, ""DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"" Comedy central's stand is repugnant and I cannot support the network in any way."
1,Season 14: The Incomplete Season,"So Comedy Central has come to the point where they support terrorists by caving into their demands. Matt and Trey have spent a decade and a half bringing humor to topics that vastly needed it, but as soon as the one group of people in the world who should be made fun of the most get targeted, then the station steps in to ruin the fun.When the uncensored version becomes available, whether by purchase or online viewing, I will return to South Park. Until then, I can no longer support anything Comedy Central has their hands in. Hopefully Matt and Trey will find a competent station to switch to once their contract expires after Season 15. They are the greatest satirists this world has, but I will wait for their shackles to be released so I can enjoy their talents untainted."
2,really,i love south park i have every season from number 1 but this season just makes me so mad i saw episdoes 200 201 when they first aired i loved them but now i cnt even watch them with any excitment. this is america we have the right to free speak so this makes me mad also south park puts the warning in the begining about the characters they use
1,"Censored (Bad Comedy Central, Bad)","I love South Park. Overall this Blu Ray is an excellent addition to the collection. However, it contains *only* the censored version of Episode 200 and 201. How often has South Park made from of various deities from around the world? Muhammad was even featured in an earlier episode (68) without controversy. Ironically this episode, which a features a moral argument against fear and censorship and calls for support of free speech, is censored.I admit that the very act of selective censorship to appease a certain group of people makes a powerful statement about those groups. Perhaps it even makes the moral commentary of these episodes more poignant. But unless that was truly the artistic intent (which Matt and Trey have denied) Comedy Central and South Park Studios should be condemned for caving to a very vocal and apparently very violent minority."
5,Another great SP bluray,"Yet another gorgeous South Park bluray release.Nice case, nice artwork, nice discs.Beautiful menu-driven interfaces on discs.Video quality crisp as a knife.Audio quality is unbelievable.I hope all future releases are this good at the least, and come with even more artwork in the future.Cheers."
4,South Park Rules,"Thought this was one of Matt & Trey's finest seasons except for the final disc. which is exclusively ""The Coon"" related material, which, personally I'm not a big fan of."
1,201 WILL BE CENSORED!!!,"THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!!! Episode 201 WILL BE CENSORED! DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! Do not give your money to Comedy Central, a network that bows down to terrorists and fear and limits free speech. I have proof that 201 will be censored in the link below.[...]DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!"
1,"Great Season, Horrible Censorship",The censorship of two episodes dealing with islam shows just how hypocritical comedy central / viacom is. They have no issues making fun of catholics and christians in general or making fun of jews. But when it comes to muslims? Viacom / Comedy Central will not get a further dime from me until these episodes are released UNCENSORED. I truly hope Matt and Trey end south park after season 15 - the damage that Viacom / Comedy Central could do to it is unimaginable.
1,I'm not buying this until it's done right.,"To think that in the world of DVD, you have the ability to show the version that is best shown. FCC does not look over the DVDs nor does the MPAA, so you can pretty much show it uncut the way it is supposed to be shown. But to not show the uncut versions of 200 and 201 just flips me off. These censored versions were not approved by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of South Park, yet they can't release the uncut versions on DVD/Blu-ray where CENSORSHIP IS NOT A CONCERN. Why? If the episodes were censored on purpose, then I wouldn't complain about this, but nope: this is not the case. I refuse to pay for this and boycott this release until Comedy Central allows the episodes to be presented unedited. This is really upsetting as my high expectations went down the drain. Till then, no deal."
1,"I love South Park but I can't tolarate censorship...especially with South Park, who previously released uncensored seasons.","Like the title says the episode 201 which deals with the episode Muhammad is heavily censored like it was when it aired on comedy central. Don't buy this product until they actually release a complete uncensored version of the 14th season. I don't blame the creators but I do blame comedy central for not having the ""cojones"" to air this episode because of some wannabe U.S. terrorist."
4,a greatskillet with a flawed handle,the exterior of this killet is raw aluminum with a rather coarse finnish.It does notbother me but some will find this insightly. the non stick interior is without reproach but the handle is too long and causes the skilletto tilt a little when empty. Once filled even a small amount of food it is fine so decide if you want to put up with an unbalanced empty skillet. Otherwise it is a bargain and performs well and I use it routinely for extra large (six jumbo eggs) omelets usingoa teasponnfull of oil and some butter to enhance both fluffiness and taste. real butter is one definite requirement for good omelets
4,A too slick to make my top ten,"I really like this record, but it's not one that I recommend unless you already have a good Juju ear. After his ""Juju Music"" record, record company folks thought that if he just cleaned it up a little, cut some of the longer jams, he could be the new Bob Marley. What came out of that was a string of lesser albums, like this one. However, I like the use of synth, which is pretty uncommon on Nigerian Juju records. I know, it makes it less pure, but it's used well. The songs are a little too tight, and there isn't the sound of joy like on so many other of King Sunny's or Chief Commander Ebenezer Obe's best work. So, don't jump on this record unless either a) you've got a good Juju collection and want to hear King Sunny's attempt at westernizing, or b)you didn't like other Juju records because they seem to loose to you."
5,Great Value,"I Purchased 10 of these stools for my bar. They arrived in 2 days!!. They were very easy to assemble (took 30 minutes to do all 10). For the price, you can't beat them. Haven't had a complaint from one customer. Only drawback was the Shipping cost more than the product, but was fast! Would recommend company and product."
4,Cheap bar stools,"The bar stools are great, comfy seat and swivel is really nice. Perfect height for my table. The assembly was a bit involved, you do have to line things up carefully, but we got it done without too much trouble.Update: One of the chair legs snapped at the joint first time we got them out, weak :/"
3,Not great but not bad.... Priced well for the quality.,So/So Quality.... the screws are poor material. Be very Careful putting them together not to damage the screws. Other than that.. Not bad quality for the money.
2,Bar stools,I Purchased these several months ago and they are actually holding up pretty well. I bought these to make do until I could get me some more. I wasn't to Happy with these Because they kinda look cheap and they sat uneven but you can buy those little rubber stoppers and this helped some. I Actually can't wait to purchased some Wooden chairs Because these like I said look kinda cheap looking but they make do ..They Ain't to comfortable either especially if you sat in them for a very long time..But I guess they were worth what I payed for them they were cheap!!!
5,Justv as i expected it to be.,"The stool is quite okay, sturdy and strong. I have used it in the past, though i was not the one that assembled it.The only challenge is in trying to fit the round leg rest into the legs of the stool. What i did was to place the stool on a table, then fix 2 screw facing eachother loosely, do the same to the remaining 2, then tighten them up, in that way you will securely fix the leg screw without any mismatch.Secondly, the stool did not come with the screw-driver for the wooden screw. So you might have to look for a driver to drive in the screw meant to secure the wooden seat.It will take you about 20 mins. I enjoyed every bit of my assembling experience!"
1,Where is my Stuff?????,Three wks back i ordered this item and not received yet. I called the customer service and they told me that this item is on the way. I am not able to track my order as Amazon says item is not processed yet. After paying shipping charges which was almost equivalent to the product price I'm quite frustrated with the seller.
4,Great Value,"We purchased these because the price was lower than any of other options, even after adding in the shipping cost. (Note that this was a 2-pack of stools.) We were concerned low price would equal low quality, but we were pleasantly surprised. These chairs were easy to assemble and look exactly as pictured. The only quality issue we noticed was that the chairs do not swivel as easily as some other stools we've owned. However, the amount of force required is reasonable - it's no trouble to swivel while sitting. These ended up being a great bargain for us to outfit the higher breakfast countertop in our kitchen."
2,small seat,Some difficulty assembling with screws that didn't slip easily into holes.Seat quite small not terribley comfortable unless you have a small bottom. Sturdy once assembled.
1,Poor Overall,"Item shipped fast and is definitely affordable. After reading reviews I expected it to be difficult to put together. I can handle that, but it is VERY hard to put together when it does not come with the hardware necessary. SO add another $25.00 to the cost for a trip to Home Depot to purchase the screws, bolts etc that are needed. And what is needed is truly anybody's guess.I do not recommend this product or this seller.I gave 1 star only because there is no way to give no stars"
1,I regret buying these.,"I buy these stools about two months ago. They took about two weeks to get here even though I paid for express shipping. They did not come with all of the necessary parts to put them together. Secondly, the first one broke within the week. Today the other broke. I've never regretted a purchase so much."
3,counter stools,The stools are okay. They are cheaply made and were quite inexpensive. You get what you pay for....the old saying. We have had them only a couple of weeks put together and they are popping screws already.
5,Gets My Support!,"Looking for a good support for your knee? Well, this would be a good choice. I'm not totally sold on the whole magnet therapy-healing thing, but there's a lot of good reasons to try this wrap. A few things to know though...-it has an insert that fits into the knee support- it provides heat/cold primarily above and below the knee cap when tightened-to cool it, you stick the insert into a freezer for at least 2 hours-two ways to heat it- in a microwave OR with boiling water. Know that with either method, you're heating the water up first, and then sticking in the insert to get it hot-its totally washable, the recommended way being by handIs it hard to put on? Not at all. And you can easily make it as snug as you want- it uses velcro and stays put firmly.A nice little knee support, I give it two thumbs up."
4,Adjustable and comfortable,This brace is adjustable and comfortable. It helped my knee start to feel better pretty quickly. I have a lot of knee damage and I hope this brace is going to improve the circulation and overall health of my joint. The one thing I would like to see different is the color.
2,HoMedics MW-KHC Knee Wrap,"This knee wrap seems to be of good quality. However, I am disappointed with the strength of the magnets. The product information said it had strong magnets but I find the magnets to be weak. I don't think the magnets are strong enough to be theraputic."
3,Reasonably priced!,"If one is really in need of an Ice pack.. one should get a better one!I had a mild tear in my ligament, so I took a chance with this one but, it was not too long before I realized that this won't be enough!But @ $20.00 this is not as bad too!"
4,Helped my knee,"My knee was swollen when I ordered this. Shortly after using this with the frozen pack, the swelling and discomfort subsided. The only con, is that the pouch for the gel pack is a bit tight and I'm concerned that it will start ripping after a lot of use."
5,We Love the Magnets,"My husband has used this on his knee and immediately feels the difference (he hasn't used the cold/heat yet, just the magnets)I have used a pillow with magnets for at least ten years now and can tell the difference if I don't use it (stiffness, discomfort etc), so we had to try this one.Anyway, it works, we're ordering another one right now. (plus magnet pads for our pets, prices have really come down a lot)"
4,Straightforward training video,"I have checked out every potty video our library has (I think about 12 or 13) and this is the best one I have seen so far. It's British which threw me a little at first, but it was the most straightforward approach I have seen which was refreshing. It's a little cheesily animated, but its tone is friendly and repetitive without getting boring. So many of the movies we have seen are just loaded with endless songs about being a big kid; potty instruction is either secondary or practically subliminal. This one gives you the basics and then goes over them in different ways. And my daughter liked it; she kept asking to watch the snails."
1,Potty Adventure,"This is a stupid video, very low budget. My daughter got nothing out of of and is just board watching it. Please do not waste your money"
4,Great Video,"This video is very helpful getting started with Adobe Premiere Elements. I have not finished the entire video yet ,but it has kept me busy. It has a feature that lets you work along with a project. Lots of tricks I did not know about. This will get you started and then some."
1,No upgrade for the CD-ROM,"Finally I got a response from Merriam-Webster. They stated that they had no intention to upgrade this 1996 CD-ROM to suit the 21st century computer with 24-bit monitor. So if you consider to buy this CD-ROM, be prepared. You will get an obsolete and amateruish CD-ROM with no technical support and no possible upgrade in the future. It is indeed a worst buy."
4,A revisit,I remembered purchasing and listening to this album long ago on vinyl and cassette tape - I purchased a piece of nostalgia and was not disappointed.
4,good find,this was a gift for my mom and i was unable to find anywhere else. great price and very satisfied with the product.
3,Explains fundamental things about databases,"This book is good for engineers which work with databases. There are explained all aspects of databases. On the other hand, the book is not reccomended for those who are interested in theory of databases. There is no formal propositions or proves of anything in this book."
1,PERSONAL IDEAS+COLLECTED WORKS,"This book is a huge disappointment!You would think that with all these pages, this would be a great book. Wrong. It is filled with the writers own formulas that look like they were photocopied from his own personal notebook! The other material is simply a collection of readily available info elsewhere, like info on ELECTROGRAVITY and T.Townsend Brown. I found about 15 pages worth anything-the rest is just the clever compiling of already known info from other sources! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Dead to Rights Prequel?,"Ok this game is fun for the first 10 minutes then you keep repeating the same thing jump slow mow use shadow jump use slow mow use shadow ..... ya i know. Story is terrible trying to find a judge for what reason? i dont know....judge dies midway through game and jack still tried to uncover stuff on him for smoe odd reason......Dead to rights 1 was amazing best game ive ever played ""goodbye Halo"". not enough disarms in DTRII Fist fighting sequences rsucked bad like cartoon animated fighting. Why is shados adrenaline meter attached to your adenaline meter? wenever u use shadow u lose adrenaline and wen u slow mo jump u lose adrenaline so screw the mutt. This game is not fun id rate it a 1.5 out of 10 50 bucks wasted go buy the orignal for 10 bucks at Electroncis Boutique."
4,Great entertainment,"No real mystery here a bang for your buck and a couple of hours of distartion. Phantoms as a bit more on edge with a sinister plot with the typical government ""I'm here to help"" but a great late evening or rainy day movie set."
2,Review,Cost for product this kit is not bad and serves the purpose it was intended too. Make sure you get the right size attachments though as the 52mm filters don't work with the adapters. Also the Bower adapter is too short and causes impact errors with the lens. The Canon Bower adapter is a much better choice. Fortunately I had one. The company replaced the filter kit after some time at no cost. The wide angle lens has substantial focal distortion at the edges if you desire to use zoom from the main lense. The adpapter is visible while using lenses without zoom so the package is not a balanced kit. I would not suggest this unless you can't afford better.
3,it's ok,"it fit my 50s olympia just fine, it worked and it was cheap. The ribbon was a little dry to start with so it will need to be replaced more quickly, but if you plan on doing alot of typing it will do just fine."
4,Won TMF Best Dutch New Release with good reason,I bought this cd last year during my exchange year to the Netherlands and it's a good one:) Not my top favorites but definitely up there. Wish I could have seen them live!
1,Real cheap item.,"I am really sad because a really good company like Amazon has this bad quality item. The one that I got didn't work, you better take a good look of what are you selling."
3,remote car starter,product was good quality and performs perfectly. however if your vehicle is newer than 2002 i could not obtain any wiring diagrams and customer service is dead or they don't answer phone.if you're not up on tracing circuits stay away from this product.
2,"Works great, until you lose the remote","Had the DesignTech 23326 system in a Dodge Caravan since 1999. Finally lost the last remove 11/2012. Try to find a replacement... their phone line gives you the runaround for as long as you put up with it... ""please call back during regular business hours..."" uhm yeah this is Saturday 12:20pm, so you should be open according to your hours which you just recited... Many places sell such a remote transmitter [for $50 +shipping - not much less than the entire system cost]... but they claim the one that looks like our remote 23361 is not for our system 23326... different frequencies. Factory paperwork has nothing about the frequency, FCC number, or anything else that would HELP in getting the correct remote. At $50 a pop, we cannot afford to guess which remote is correct. So, great product, but ZERO USEFUL TECH SUPPORT. Cannot even speak to a person at all."
4,Welcome Home Cracker Meal,"I have been searching for cracker meal for some time, as my area no longer carries the product. This is necessary for cooking seafood and chicken!"
4,Silly Fun,Silly fun can be had with this. The keychain is small and hard to read but still a great conversation piece.
5,Just Buy It!!!,I flipped though it and bought it on a whim. It is the best thing I have ever done for myself. This book is amazing!!! It's not just wonderful because it is a great pick-me-up... but it's also brilliant in the writing. Many of the things could be performance pieces or hit a wide audiance. Just read it you won't go wrong! Highly recommended
1,very disappointing,"I actually bought this book for a single article (Judith Podell's ""Blues For Advanced Beginners""), but aside from her piece, as I browse through the rest of the book, I have not found one item so far that even got me to snicker or smile.Either the American comedy writers of today have totally lost their sense of humor, or are trying to be too high brow and pseudo-intellectual, or I am getting too old and insensitive.In any case, I will soon pawn this book at my local used book store..."
4,Delightful kart-racing madness!,"Let me start off by saying that this is one of the best kart racing games for PS1 ever made. The characters are creative, each with their own personality, (although their physical features don't vary much). And you gotta love soarin' down the track at 200 mph. Not to mention the arsenal of weapons and traps. And perhaps the best feature of the game, the shortcuts! There is a shortcut in all but one track! (After all, the motto IS ""Whatever it takes to win""). Plus, hidden bonus characters to keep the player interested. The only down-side of this game is that sometimes it can seem far too difficult. For example, the final boss race, which I, myself, haven't beaten yet."
2,Not what you expect,"I purchased this game because I believed it to be similar to Crash Team Racing and because I had read reviews that it was fun, addictive, etc. The graphics are great. I found the characters very hard to steer (you get light, medium and heavy characters to choose from)and I tried several. My dual shock controller was no help (I think I actually did better with the regular controller), which is odd for a game released in 2000. It needs work. I suggest to anyone considering this game - stick with Crash Team Racing - a lot more fun without as much frustration."
5,"Move Over Mario,Diddy,and Crash...Here Comes SPEED PUNKS!","I Recently bought this game and it's Great. U get 2 pick from 6 different racers with their own look and stats,and there are some secret characters that u can unlock 2.The graphics are the best part of the game,even if your fly'n at an unimaginal speed,there is no hint of slow-down.The couses are well detailed making it hard 4 the player 2 become bored,no-matter what the track is always changing in some way making it Fun.The control is very cool,allowing u 2 powerslide on sharp turns and 2 shoot weapons at ur opponents.If there is any downside 2 the game its the sound(which is not a big issue)The sound of the characters is different from other go-karting games where in CTR the drivers talk alot during the race.But the Drivers in Speed Punks never really talk,instead they make little laughs or gestures.So Basically,SPEED PUNKS is a must-have game u should definitly buy and add 2 your game library,especially 4 racing gamers."
4,"Good,But Not Good Enough To Outsmart CTR","CTR was a very good kart racing game.I was a little disappointed when I got Speed Punks.For one thing,no adventure mode! No hills,no big drops,that sort.The graphics are about the best in the kart racing world.That is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of three.The missiles come in three types,untracking missiles,untracking three missiles together,and homing missiles.Another bad thing,the game is very difficult! I got past the easy tournament and medium tournament,but the hard is just plain difficult! Another bad thing,just six racers! Monica,a boy hating girl who is tyed with her enemy,Monty in racing,Tabitha,a spoiled rotten little girl with good acceleration,Tempest,who encourages the other racers to skip school to go racing,and who stole the kart of who was going to be a speed punk,Tetsuo,and Brains,the computer expert."
5,I have other products too,"I also have the Aveda Bodywash. This Rosemary/Mint combination stimulates your head as it washes, making it feel really clean and the smell is great. Expensive, but you don't need much."
3,Shampoo is shampoo,"This is OK Shampoo, I didn't find it to be any better than any other. The smell is OK too, though not my favorite."
1,Doesn't clean my hair well - leaves it weighed down and feeling dirty,"I've used Aveda Rosemary Mint shampoo in hotels and bought a bottle for myself since I liked the refreshing uplifting scent. Just over a few days, my hair feels heavy - weighed down by residue and oily. So I switched back to a standard shampoo with SLS and my hair feels clean and light again.I think that it doesn't work if you have a very oily scalp and thick hair. I've found this to be the case with SLS free shampoos with my hair like Kiss My Face as well."
2,Heavy Metal,"The steel Hot Rod peddle car is too heavy for a child to use. The small steering wheel provides inadequate force to turn the large front wheels. My son would ride to the end of the block, get out of the peddle car and walk back because he could not steer the car around, nor could he lift the heavy car and turn it around.Not worth the money spent."
4,For my Grandson,"I bought this car for my Grandson. The only problem was assembly of the steering wheel. I had to cut 1/8"" from the center of the wheel, in order for the screw to align & I question the durability of the plastic steering wheel. When my Grandson saw it, he jumped right in & his eyes lit up. It was worth it to see his reaction."
4,Instructions?,"We bought a 70230, took it home opened the box, no instructions, not even a scrap of paper! You folks at Valley should at least put instructions in the box. Aggravating. My husband figured it all out but the swearing was not appreciated! Overall good looking product."
4,weight distribution hitch,"Packaging was poor, box was torn open when my husband rec'd it. Would have been nice to know whether or not this was made for a v front trailer or not. Shipping was fast, however."
4,Wusthof 4622 Classic,"Although a good sharp knife, this is not a traditional style fillet knife. It is much more tapered and narrower than I imagined from the picture. Also, at the time, it said it came with a sheath but this version did not. The seller did make good on that, after the initial purchase, to which I was thankfullIt would excell as a boning knife, and for intricate cutting or removal of fine bones- but for me it did not produce even fillets for fish, especially smaller stripers.I ended up purchasing a Dexter Russell fillet knife on Amazon, which fit the bill to what I was after.This Wustof is better left in the hands of a culinary expert, rather than those of an old school fisherman such as myself."
5,1st Class Seller,Wusthof clearly makes the best cooking knives...and this seller is right up there with them. Great customer service. THANKS !!
4,Very Good.,"Very Nice, Very sharp knife. Wish it would have came with a knife holder for the price. Would purchase again"
3,"Not the knife pictured or described, but still a great knife","I have a Wusthof set of knives, and I love them. I was purchasing this knife for my man-friend as a Christmas gift for his fishing trips. The website shows and describes a completely different knife than what I received, but the product I received has the same name as the product listed. So, I guess my mistake for not researching a little better.Either way, the knife you will receive is great, but not ideal for taking on a fishing boat."
4,Bootiful!,"Loved these boots, wanted to keep them but they had issues.... Calves WAY too wide, and the boot just runs about a half-size big. Would have exchanged for smaller, but they were sold-out. Worth your while and $$ to buy them and have the calves taken in at a shoe repair. The leather is soft and thick; the boot in general is beautifully made and sleek (except for the huge calves). The heel and platform are in perfect proportion, not too high or thick, just right. And the boot is soooo comfortable and easy to walk in. Wish I could find in my size in Black!"
1,not even close,not even close to the right item. you put in the make model year style of your van & get something totally different.
2,No Good,"I was sorely disappointed by this album. I expect bands to release live albums when they are actually good live, when the album documents them ably performing their songs, but with the energy that comes from a live audience, etc. This album does none of that.I was very excited to get this cd in the mail, but while half a dozen songs are well done, well performed and sound great, I have to believe that Juliana could have chosen tracks that were more mistake free (the album is frought with bad solos, off-key vocals, and general sloppiness). Additionally, and this may have more to do with the order of the tracks on the album, but there is no momentum here. Likely the result of culling tracks from various shows, there is no continuity, and this lack of continuity enhances the flaws that are there (flaws that would likely be ignored if we were getting an entire show)."
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge JH fan and was really looking forward to this. Unfortunately it just doesn't gel for some reason. Maybe not enough of her better songs or whatever, but it definitely misses the mark. ""Choose Drugs' is one great track though."
2,A piece of junk,"Flash didn't work most of the time and if it did, it took to long to set itself up again. Had to change batteries constantly!!"
2,good for a first digital camera,"This camera is basically only good for someone that doesn't know alot about computers and digital camera.what stinks about this camera, is there is no flash....and you can't buy a memory card to store more pictures, so it's not good for a vacation.the quality wasn't the best, kinda grainy....but if you're just looking for a simple camera to learn the basics of how to work digital cameras, this is a good way to learn w/o spending too much money"
2,HELP,"I RECIEVED THIS CAMERA FOR CHRISTMAS. I HAVE NO YET HAD A CHANCE TO USE IT, BECAUSE WHEN I RECIEVED IT, THE CORD THAT CONNECTS TO THE COMPUTER WAS CUT IN HALF.I HAVE TAKEN PICTURES BUT I CAN NOT RETREVE THEM BECAUSE THE CORD WAS CUT IN HALF. I HAVE TRIED TO CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE TO FIND OUT WHERE I COULD GET ANOTHER CORD, BUT THEY WERE NO HELP. IF ANYONE COULD PLEASE HELP ME OUT, LET ME KNOW WERE I CAN GET ANOTHER CORD I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY. I HAVE TRIED LOCAL CAMERA STORES, THEY DO NOT CARRY THEM. SO IF SOMEONE COULD PLEASE HELP, I WOULD LOVE TO TRY MY NEW CAMERA"
3,GREAT FOR THE PRICE,"You definitely get what you pay for! I purchased mine just to email pictures to my friends and family and it works great. I still use my regular camera for important pictures that I want printed.It's a very simple camera for very simple purposes so if you are one of those cheapskates who thinks they'll get high quality for pennies, you better look elsewhere.You do need a good amount of light since it does not have a flash, but you can't take pictures without light even with a regular camera.Overall I'm very happy with mine and it fufills the purpose intended."
2,it needs Windows2000 s/w to overcome compatibility problem,i am unable to download the photoes to my PC b'cos my pc is winodws2000. the s/w provided with the camera is for win98 .so it would be better and helpful to furnish with windows 2000compatible s/w or atleast windows NT compatible.
1,Shame on Polaroid,"My 6 year old got this camera for Christmas. I did not expect much but got astonishingly less. The resolution is great (for 6 year olds and email). The quality of the pictures is horrible. I would not trust a company that put their name prominently on a camera like this. This camera needs A LOT of light! The compromise on the flash is acceptable at its price. However, there is no excuse for the quality of the pictures, blurry and out of focus, even when a tripod is used to take a picture of a stationary object."
3,Emailing The Photo,"I recieved this camera this past March.I since have played with it to email the photo's out.The instruction booklet was of no use. Since then I havemissed placed it.I had called the company for help.They were of little help may I say.So here I sit with this nice digital camera, no instructionand not a clue how to email out my photo'sCan you help??ThanksAnn"
2,Don't expect much....,"I got this camera so I wouldn't have to get the film developed. lol. I also bought it for simple snap shots. What I like is that you can download the pictures onto your hard drive, erase them from your camera if you don't like them, comes with a battery and cord, you can retouch photos (not in a professional way), add special effects, take video captures, and play with 'photo fantasy' (your face on someone elses body). It doesn't take the good photos (made me rethink why I didn't get a camera with film). This Polaroid is only for kids or those who is new to digital cameras. Start with this model and get familiar with it, then buy a better camera."
1,not good at all,"this camera is a waste of money, please just take my word on it, it is a good price but you do get what you pay for this is not even good for a kid."
2,WANTING HELP AND NOT GETTING IT,"I BOUGHT THE CAMERA SINCE I NEEDED SOMETHING TO LEARN ON BEFORE TAKING MY VACATION 07/2002.I HAVE TRIED TO DOWNLOAD THE PICTURES TO NO AVAIL.I'VE TRIED TO CONTACT VIA THe WEB,WHICH IS NO LONGER WORKING.tHE HOURS LISTED FOR AVAILABILITY IS NOT CORRECT.i HAVE YET TO SPEAK TO A REPRESENTATIVE OR SPECIALIST.aT THIS POINT, THE PICTURES REMAIN IN THE CAMERA SO i CANNOT ATTEST TO HOW GOOD,OR BAD THEY ARE.I DO BELIEVE iF I EVER TALK TO A LIVE BODY,I WILL HAVE SOMETHING TO RATE."
3,i lost the software to my polaroid digital 320 camera,so wood polaroid send me the sofware for my camera my polaroid digal 320 s/n.049pson106858 to 17427 donert-st hesperia ca 92345
4,I love my camera,"I am novice at the computer and this camera was easy for me to install and use. I mainly use it to take pictures of the grandchildren to send over the internet to friends and selling things on auction. No, they are not professional pictures and I've never printed one out but if you just love taking pictures and want to save the picture developing charges...this is the way to go.At least it is for me and I have enjoyed my camera tremdously!!!!!"
1,A Piece Of Junk,"I'm ashamed to have chosen one star for this product. If I was able to click -0-, I would have. Don't waste your money on the Polaroid 320. Trying to get the pictures to download is a trauma in itself. It's a piece of junk."
3,Not A BAd Camera if You Have No Other.,I DOnt Have A digital camera so this one will do just fine.But everything must be done in Bright Light or else the picture comes out poor.i would say if you dont own a camera & dont wanna spend alot of money this is not really alot of money to spend. But dont expect AWSOME pictures the pictures just get by with alot of help with a picture editing program. But hey its my 1st camera & i think i can make it work. (just affaid to grab the camera to tight affraid i might brake it)Buy one for FUN!.
2,not worth the money,"I was given this camera as a Christmas gift. I can't believe that a camera was actually produced in this day and age without a flash. It is useless unless you are outside. Even outside, you can only take close up shots and they don't come out really well. Forget distance shots! Other reviewers are recommending this for a child but I wouldn't even waste the money to do that. I'd rather buy a cheaper 35mm camera with a flash for someone just beginning to take pictures. I'd definitely stay clear of this one!"
2,OK .... It's not a great camera,"OK ... This is not a great camera. No flash, low resolution pictures and limited capacity. But what do you expect for $50? For an easy to use, low priced first step into digital cameras, this is a good choice. The software is easy to load and operate and the picture quality, though not good, is sharp enough to get you started on how to adjust digital pictures and use them on the Internet. The kit includes everything you need to start taking pictures right out of the box, camera, battery and serial cable. Try it out, then upgrade and give it to the kids for use with their friends! As I said, for $50, it's an OK package."
1,Save some Money,"Digital cameras, like computers approximately double in power and halve in price every 18 months. True, digital cameras are easy to use and fun to play with on your pc, but please save time and money, and don't be tempted by the promise (or price) of anything under 1 megapixel. This camera looks nice, and thats about it - grainy picture quality over 3""x5"", blocky resolution, and poor light enhancement. Do yourself a favour, and stick with a normal camera until you can afford to really experiment with something worthwhile."
2,Needs Contact Lenses,"This digital camera needs contact lenses! The images produced by the camera were all blurry, just like my eyes without glasses. I admit that it is easy to use but the resolution is not satisfactory."
3,It's all right for having fun.,"This one is okay. It takes its best photos midday, outside, at about ten feet. If you're too far away, it's not that great. If you're too close up, naturally you'll get a blurry photo. The flash often makes the object being photographed a big, white glare. It's good for beginners, not too expensive, and good to practise with. The software is not that great. You should probably supplement with Adobe. Take a lot of pictures, and know your camera for the best satisfaction in photoshooting. :-)"
2,Not -SO-Good,"I found that the camera was not as good as they had admitted. Oh dont get me wrong for the price it's great ( for outdoors in daylight ) it takes a good picture but still pixelated and it does show up ""boxy"""
1,guaranteed out-of-focus shots,"When I purchased this inexpensive camera, I expected poorer than average image quality, but I never considered that the images might be unusable.Every single shot taken by this camera appears badly out of focus. Shots I took at 5 inches (!) looked no worse than those taken within the recommended 3-6 feet. Some reviewers seem to think that the poor quality is because of the small size of the images - but on web pages, 0.07 megapixel images should look just fine."
1,Very poor camera,This cheep plastic camera is not worth the effort to produce. The tiny photos are grainy and hard to make out. Don't waste your money on it. I ended up trashing it because it's useless.
4,Does work with Windows XP,This Camera does work with windows xp except to make it work you have to change the compatibility on the setup file from xp to 95 or 98 so it will work except you have to do some things before.This camera is a great bargain except if it had a flash it would be much better
1,GARBAGE!!,"THIS CAMERA WAS THE WORST CAMERA I HAVE EVER HAD, I HATE IT. IT TAKES THE WORST PICTURES I HAVE EVER SEEN AND WITH NO FLASH IT IS A PEICE OF JUNK THAT SHOULD BE THROWEN AWAY. PLEASE IF YOUR THINKING OF BUYING A DIGI CAM BUY SOMETHING ELSE......I am planning on buying the poloroid PDC-700,... ...AND GO FOR VALUE IN THE CAMERA NOT JUST THE CHEAP PRICES.."
1,Not worth the money,"I found this camera VERY unsatisfactory. It seems like a waste to even produce something of such poor quality. No flash, does not focus well on still objects. The pictures are grainy at best, not at all like the ones in the sample gallery. Hardly worth giving this to a beginner, they will only be disappointed in the ability of the camera. If you are a photographer, forget it. You truly get what you pay for. Not worth the shipping cost. What was Polaroid thinking?"
4,Excellent device for the Price.,"I bought this little camera and was pleasantly surprised- forsuch a small price you get a camera with 320x240 resolution which is fine for onscreen viewing, and although the docs say that the camera can only record 18 shots- I was able to shoot no less than 41 images on one test. The image quality and focus were very OK! Can the resolution be better? Obviously. Would it be nice to have on-camera previews? Obviously. Would it be nice if the camera was faster? Obviously. BUT for those you have to be prepared to shell out at least $100 to $200 more dollars. In Short- For its price this is probably the best value you can get today- as long as you remember its limitations and do not expect it to perform like a $300 machine."
1,Unbelievable this is still on the shelves..,"I was very disappointed with the product. I was gonna give this to a family member after first testing this product. Made some photos with it and found the camera useless. The qualitity of the photos is so poor. You need a lot of light for photos inside (next time I would get a flash camera). Photos outside hardly show the image. The number of pixels are apparently too low to expect a decent picture. Unbelievable Polaroid sells this product. I was emberrased to give this camera as a present. Instead, returned the product and bought a 20USD bottle of wine!"
1,"Awful, don't waste your time or money","This camera is just awful. Although you can't expect much at that price, you sould at least get pictures that you can recognize. Just don't bother."
1,Not worth your purchase!,"This item is too light, has an awkward handle and leaks! I'm getting something to replace it because it leaves pools of oil on my counter!"
4,A great way to keep learning while you drive,I love the selection of words presented in this tape. I bought volume 2 as well. My only complaint is that I wish they would spend a bit more time on each word to help solidify it in your memory. I often have to rewind due to the relatively fast pace. But I guess you can always listen to it again. The words are presented in a conversational format between two people -- as if they were having a discussion over coffee. This helps maintain your interest. I recommend this for anyone interested in developing or maintaining a good vocabulary (and who spends too much time commuting to work).
5,Up And Comer!,"Wow! This is a very good band playing SRV style blues-rock. Would rank along with Joe Bonamassa, but not quite as polished. The video is very good and the audio is clear and well mixed. The band is tight and very enjoyable to watch as well as listen to. Their version of ""Almost Cut My Hair"" is VERY good and shows their style changes and vocal range of Davy Knowles. This is one I will watch again as well as pick up there CDs.I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's DVDs and Blu-ray's.1. Performance2. Quality of Audio3. Quality of Video (for DVDs and Blu-ray's)1.****2.*****3.*****Bands that wish to have there performances recognized and recorded should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it."
1,"""Shower Crazy"" more like...","Ridiculous book!Was it me or was the main character Rosie jumping into the shower every other page? Seriously, I know she's training for a marathon but do we have to witness every shower she has or every shower she wants to have or every shower that other characters might have??It was just a painful book to read."
3,"Was alright, but have seen better",It was just alright. She did give some insites for woman as to why some do the things they do in a marriage. But had a hard time understanding her feelings at times. I was able to finish it. But was hoping for more real feelings that Rosie had to of had towards her husbands verbal abuse. It was a easy read if you want to just pass the time.
3,"Not that great, just ok.","I found this book to be a little unbelievable. Rosie became a muscle bound, 15 mile a day jogger, canoer and all around fitness champion in a matter of weeks. That was just too unreal. Also, who would bet on a $302 million lottery with the likes of Kent...and on a Triathalon at that?Just not a good story line."
1,Surprisingly poor,"What happened to Fern Michaels' writing style? I was sadly disappointed in this book. The dialogue between characters seemed to be run-on sentences. Each person said absolutely everything that was on their mind in one rush of air. Rosie's sneaky, conniving husband changes for the better and becomes a decent person. It was a totally unbelievable character change. I don't think I've ever disliked a book this much and I'm a connoisseur of romance books on the best sellers list."
5,What a wonderful story....,"This is a fantastic book. It's got everything I love.... a good story, fantastic characters and a wonderful message. The ending took my breath away. I felt on top of the world when I finished the book. AWESOME!"
3,It Could Have Been Better,"The story premise is good, but the continual comments about a size 14 woman being ""huge"" is a mistake. A size 14 is not that huge! I guess we were to assume that the main character was that size because she ate so much and didn't exercise. At least she learned to eat properly and take better care of herself. However, some of us are a 14+, work out reguarly, and eat right, too.I like that the main character feels better about herself as she becomes slimmer; however, when are we women going to appreciate that we don't have to be a size 4 or 6 to be beautiful?"
2,Namco needs an education in what an RPG is,"I was looking forward to a long rpg. But it turns out Dragon Valor is a straight forward adventure game. There is no brain twisting or puzzles. Just straight forward hack and slash. It's true you have certain rpg element as in magic and medieval stuff, but besides that you're limited to choices. Once you past an area you can't go back there. I repeat once you beat an area there is no return. So already you're looking at a level based game. There are no villages to walk through or a bars where you can go in to dally with average people. All you get is a one time trip to a shop. Worse part are the shops are restricted too. Each time you encounter a shop what you get to do is already chosen. It alternates between selling, buying and trading. Where is the freedom to roam towns, mingle with people, and go back to old places for deja vu?"
4,Dragon Valor is good,"Dragon Valor is a very good game. I really enjoyed playing it,mostly the three possible ways to go. But, be warned, some of these bosses will really make you mad, especially Dahaka. I'm still trying to beat that little....uh...meanie..yeah, meanie. If you like RPGs play this game!"
4,Dragon Valor,"This is a very unique game from characters, to story line, to game play. It has a fairly large learning curve, meaning it will take you awhile to get used to all of the many moves and functions of the game, however once you have a pretty good grasp of how to play, the game itself is very challenging and fun.For as old of a game as this is, the CG movies are class, and the voice acting isn't to bad. The differences in the available extrats and endings makes this game worth a try."
1,Namco + RPG = A Flop,Upon reading the back of this case I thaught this game would be great. I alos was happy to find Namco doing a game that isn;t fighting or Racing. This game mixes elements from a lot of other rpg games I have played and most of the time when there is a lot of diffrent systems in one RPG game it is great. Too Bad this wasn't the case with Dragon Valor. I am so sick with myself for shelling out [price] for this. I guess im stuck with it until Arc The Lad comes out for Psone if it isn't delayed again. I would also like to make one last note. Namco stick to Fighting and Racing.
3,Good story if you don't like much spice,"I found this to be a good story and very much a true depiction of the characters of the Regency period. If, however, you like to see the romance develop a little spice, this does not. The attraction barely goes beyond a chaste kiss. This is the same in both of the Louise Bergin books I have read. The dialog is a little bit stuffy also."
1,Romance Novels have gone down the drain,"This dribble of a novel has not kept my attention. Hardly any romance, i do not recommend this author."
5,I get so emotional baby...,"While I was living in England (I'm American) I bought a compilation CD of ""Britpop"" music and the song ""This Feeling"" was on the CD. It was love at first listen. It is probably the most beautiful rock song I've ever heard. I tried to get this album and even though I was living in England I could not find it. I finally found it here at Amazon last year and boy was it worth the wait.This is the type of music that just grabs your emotions and twists them. You close your eyes and get transported to another landscape. If you are into Britpop and/or emo then get this album."
2,Rusty strings,"Product was delivered quickly, however 3 of strings were rusty.Seems like this product stocked for such a long time in not appropriate condition.I found those after I put 2 good strings, so I could not return the product. Sigh!That's why I gave 2 stars."
4,Great Strings,I got these strings for my Ovation Guitar per manufacturer suggestion. I put them on and they sound great. They arrived as scheduled. Overall this was a great buy.
2,I wouldn't want to be her partner...,"Tori Lowell is an FBI agent with something to prove. She's been stuck behind a desk since the academy and she's finally gotten a chance to prove herself only to find she's been partnered with her old nemesis, Carter Sinclair. But Tory's got a chip on her shoulder a mile high. Everyone's out to get her. Never mind that she'd be totally untrustworthy in a field situation. Her conviction that she always knew what was right was a tad annoying by page 50, but by p200 I couldn't stand her. To like a romance novel I have to like the hero & heroine. He was fine...too bad he was saddled with her. Poor man."
1,Not built sturdy enough,"We got this for our son. On the first attempt to use it, it stopped working after making one ice. The chamber that spins the ice over the blade stopped spinning. The gear that drives it is also not spinning, meaning something broke closer to the motor. The warranty calls for sending it back (at your cost). Back to the store it goes..."
4,This was great!,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas after reading how horrible the Snoopy SnowCone machine was to use. I find that this is really easy to use, you get a lot of ice in a short amount of time and everyone is happy with the finished product. It is loud, but for the short amount of time that it's on I don't think it's so bad. I'd buy it again in a second."
1,"""Let's stand here and get drunk""","Featuring perhaps the most awkward and stilted dialogue ever, what The Ghosts of Goldfield lacked in writing, it did not make up in acting or special effects. We did get a few laughs out of it; unintentional ones I'm sure, but not enough to recommend it for its camp value. Really, there's nothing to recommend this poor excuse of a movie at all. Except for the Kool-aid blood."
3,Rum-Rum,"Any review of this recording that fails to mention the distracting background noise makes one wonder how closely the reviewer was listening. Throughout the Duruflé Requiem, there is a consistent noise that sounds like a needle stuck in a grove at the end of an old LP: ""rum-rum, rum-rum, rum-rum..."" While it is possible one might not hear it played back through speakers, it is impossible to miss through headphones.As to the performance, I prefer the austere sound of the organ against the ethereal sounds of the chorus. My only reservation lies with the boy tremble, whose vocal output is unsteady, almost nervous sounding, as though he were being forced to sing. I don't think an idea performance with organ accompaniment exists, but this performance comes as close as any I have heard."
2,Deceptive Durufle,"If one were to listen solely to the Faure Requiem and some of the other choral works on this 2 CD compilation, this would be a decent recording of great French choral music. However, as someone looking for a good recording of the Durufle, I was highly disappointed. Not only is the recording simply an organ reduction of full score, but the quality of singing was below what one would expect to find on a CD from a major label. Marked by under-developed techniques and inconsistencies in pitch, the recording is good if you need to learn the work in a hurry, but little else. If you're in the market for a Faure recording, this will do the job and you can preview the Durufle, but look elsewhere for a serious recording of such a rich work."
