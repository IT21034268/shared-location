2,Not great quality,The cost is good but the quality is not so good. You get what you pay for I suppose.
4,"Technical excellence, contents: esoteric","We organ lovers find it rare to find good organ works that really give the pipes a good workout. This one has nice loud passages, plus good voicing (choice and mixture of the pipes).Each track has in addition to the organ: wind instruments! Reeds, brass, flutes, and percussion too. Result: A truly unique album that sounds great, yet reminds us of being at an organ recital with a marching band playing, or perhaps competing.Lovable & annoying. But truly memorable. A+ for effort and originality. A+ for doing a Percy Grainger work. A+ for not recording the Big Ben theme for the 11,000th time. C+ for lacking in symphonic balance. C+ to this reviewer for not being more open to novel interpretations.Most organs CDs have at least one passage that reminds you of being at a funeral. But not with this one."
5,"Powerful Music, indeed !",This is the way it should be done ...a great recording that will knock your socks off if you have the system to do it justice. I mean don't judge it by how the song samples sound on small speakers. A system with a subwoofer or subwoofers is a must. The Polka & Fugue from Schwanda the Bagpiper with the organ pedal points included will spoil you for any other versions without. The liner notes by Michael Barone (host of MPR's Pipedreams) are a great addition.
1,Not worth the money,I bought this for my classroom because it was described as a Home Alone in Spanish. The movie is unwatchable. It isn't funny or cute. Don't waste your money.
4,Good for lapsteel,"I bought this book to help with my lap steel playing. After all, lap steel is playing slide in a more comfortable position. This book gives you the information you need to play licks in a blues scale for a number of different tunings. It does not give you all of the patterns you can use, but it will get you where you need to be. It also gives you information for forming minor chords in different locations on the freeboard. These are explained, and there is also a diagram of the location of the minor chords on the fretboard. The book is user friendly, but may be a bit difficult if you do not play guitar already."
3,Disappointing,"I know Fred Sokolow is a good series of guitar books, but when it comes to the ""slide"" books I am disappointed by this: his fret maps are the same as in other of his books that I have seen. When you ""fret"" a slide guitar you have to land the slide directly over the fret. When you make a chord or select a note on a non-slide guitar you have to land between the frets. It appears to me that the fret maps in his slide books are exactly the same maps that are in his regular guitar books and I find it frustrating to interpret. Time consuming."
2,Messy film,"Jigsaw puzzle of a plot line. Very primitive fight sceens and death blows. I felt like I was watching a remake of a movie made 50 years ago the was remade trying to be very simple and true to the original.This movie is very simplistic and although interesting at times you will find yourself asking the question am I really still watching this.If you want a movie depicting a Russian / Poland conflict buy the movie ""1612"". It is light years ahead of this movie in quality.Bottom line is if you like period pieces with large scale battle scenes and war this movie is way down the list of must sees and will leave you wanting more out of the movie."
1,Religion and Nationalism,"If the point of this movie is to display how life was once a bit messy then in every redundant grimy bloody detail it succeeded. The actors, dirt, blood & Vodka, etc. were continually well played to the point of being overly used and eventually tiresome. Is there some sense of historical record? Yes, I suppose, but who's to say after 500 years with few first hand accounts. Even Gogol rewrote the Bulba novelette, two hundred years after the portrayed events, in the mid 1800s to appease Russian sentimentality.One star because the entire production from writing, to directing to editing is an affront to any viewer who succeeded in passing the 11th grade (graduation not required). If there ever was a modality to showcase nationalism, particularly with religious underpinnings, then this movie did so but contrary to it's intent the result is a sense of disgust. Did the producers really think their audience would be so naive or did they care?"
5,Terrific double-feature!,"My 4-yr old and our family love both DVDs. There are some very serious topics in Prince of Egypt including slavery and death. But we were able to discuss with him in an age appropriate way. Both include inspiring life lessons for both kids and adults. I especially love the presentation of Joseph's life and perseverance. The DVDs both warn in a beginning note that all the facts may not be correct, but that they capture the essence of these accounts- which I agree Dreamworks did marvelously."
5,Super,My kids are at 7 and 4. They both like these two movies and they have been watching them over and over again since we received the CDs. It is a nice way to tell biblical stories. We all enjoy the songs in the movies too. Now they can tell the stories to their friends.
5,IBM Thinkpad battery,The 9 cell Lithium Ion rechargeable battery for IBM ThinkPad series laptop and notebook computers really does extend the user time from 21/2 hours for the original battery to 5 to 6 hours.
4,Works as advertised - just set your charge cycle properly,"Nineteen months after using this battery everyday, it's now showing some signs of wear. Occasional reconditioning restores some capacity, but from a high of about 2.5 hours, am now down to 40 mins per charge, all things being equal.I've modified the cycle, as suggested by the IBM Battery Maximizer app, hoping this will extend the life some more. Apparently, if you're plugged in most of the time, it's better to get the charger to stop at less than 100% capacity, and start recharging at below 90% capacity.Nothing wrong with the battery, really. It works as advertised. I just wished it would have lived a little longer."
3,Is it really a Ni-Cad battery ?,"battery life is only about 18 months old, then it will last about 1 hour before dying on you on a full charge. Looks more like a Ni-Cad than a Lithium-Ion."
5,"Fun, Basic Sunday School songs!",My boys LOVE our music time during the day where we spend a few minutes listening and singing along to this cd while dancing around!! It has all the great basic songs. I would definitely recommend this CD.
3,not what I wanted,I do not like how it has 3 songs grouped together on a track and when I put it in the DVD player to listen and it was just the music without the singing.
1,Is there singing bc I can't hear it?!,This CD for kids would be great if you could actually hear what they are saying in the music. I would really like to get my money back for this item. Not a good purchase.
5,Maybe Songs Grandparents Love to Sing,I was glad to replace my copy of this CD that went astray in the Sunday school classroom while I was taking the summer off from volunteering. The songs are familiar and easy to sing and tell the Bible stories for children.
5,This CD has all the great kids church songs!,My son loves when we listen to this CD in the car. I has all the same songs I grew up singing in church.
2,Doesn't have words,"I was pretty dissapointed in this cd. It only has music. Most of the songs I don't know which song it is even suppose to be, so forget singing along to it. And I know a lot of Bible songs! Wish it would have mentioned that it was only music in the description, then I could have saved my money for something else."
1,Bad,"no words just tunes that arnt orginal..i wantd 2 hear the ole songs, with the lyrics..anothr bad investment.and iv got to write atleas 20 words. Lol lol"
5,Bought as a gift,"We own this CD and play it in our car almost every time we go anywhere with our 2-year-old daughter and now newborn son. Our 2-year-old pays attention to it, listens to it, loves it, and sometimes tries to sing along or sing the songs on her own later when we're not even listening to it. She's been listening to it since she got the CD over a year ago and isn't bored with it yet. Since she loves it so much, we bought it this time as a gift for a neighbor's son who is 3 weeks older than her for his 2nd birthday."
5,"""Roman, a Must for Religion & History Buffs!""","""Roman..."" intrigued me both because of its historicity and its narration of the trial of a clergyman. I found it very interesting and informative. I did not realize the great division in Indiana between the immigrants and the ""Americans.""The author evidenced great research and shows the ability to bring history alive in this highly unusual story."
3,only fuel for this movie is the cast,cast are great in this movie..Michael Madsen plays a bartender whos sister played by Virginia Madsen is getting married...Madsen's old boyfriend who left her at the alter played by Tom Sizemore(in one of his best performances) comes back for forgiveness..meanwhile theres this cocky scheme man played by Jim Belushi who becomes friends with Luke Perry..Perry takes Madsen's money for the wedding and Belushi ends up taken it and then when Belushi thinks hes gone Sizemore pops out of the back and takes it back....Jeremy Davies is a woman lover..Chris Penn plays a booky guy whos marrige to Mary Stuart Masterantonio is crumbling and Hal Halbrook plays a man at the bar with some old stories for Madsen...great performances all around. sort of dry in some spots though but you wont notice
2,This book is supposed to improve your spelling???,"I have to agree with ""tomtrumpet"". I was seriously disturbed when I went through the diagnostic tests with my daughter. The very first problem on one of the very first tests has the words ""immediatly"" and ""enviroment"" as being spelled correctly. What?!?!? I thought I was going insane. Maybe I read the answers for the wrong test?? Nope. Those are the words they had marked as being spelled correctly. I have not gotten past the diagnostic tests, and am now, seriously considering whether or not I want to proceed. I expected more from a book that promises ""Better Spelling in 30 Minutes a Day."" (Yes, I do realize book titles should be capitalized, but was not able to do that on this review format.)"
2,Not that great,"Unfortunately, this book has too many typos and/or errors. I wouldn't recommend using it as a reference. However, it does have a couple of useful spelling rules (but again, I'm not sure whether I can rely on them)."
4,Excellent,Excellent book. So many twists and turns I could NOT put it down. Looking forward to reading more of his books.
5,Intrigue and mystery on Long Island,I totally enjoy reading a book (preferably a mystery or thriller) that takes place on the East Coast. This one was also fun to read. Will look for more by Scoppettone! I'm a fast reader so having a Kindle to pick these books from (on Amazon) is fantastic. No waiting! Reasonably priced.
5,A real who done it,"Thoroughly enjoyed reading Razzamatazz.fast paced, good story telling and wellresearched. Kept me flipping pages on myKindle til I finished. Will pick up more of Scoppettone books."
4,Spellbinding,"Excellent book, very well written and keeps you in suspense until the end. I would recommend this author and book."
4,Interesting story line,The author does keep you guessing 'who did it' throughout the book. Quick read and holds your attention. Would recommend.
2,garbage feels like paper headset,"this one works like not having headphones on at all.feels lightweight and very cheap, what do you expect from chinese manufacturing their 2125 headset while also garbage at least makes your voice sound loud and clear although the earpieces and headset is so tiny and lightweight maybe a girl would like it better. their amp stinks too its 4.5 volts , plantronics amps are 7.5 volts but plantronics headsets and amps are also garbage, so i'd stick with the gn 2125 and gn 8000 amp. i think it sounds better because of the boom mic spongetip design. dont bother getting their most expensive headset the jabra biz duo the noise cancelling mic cancels everything including your own voice. you cant hear yourself in the headset."
5,Love How He Sings,"Marcos Witt is Christian but, I never had a Marcos Witt CD and end up being unhappy. Usually he sings in Spanish but, however he sings I love it."
1,this camera is the worst,"I got this camera for christmas, I was very excited to take pictures and e-mail them to other people. Unfortunatley this cameras pictures never turned out on the computer. this camera said that it could hold 128 pictures but it could really hold about 20 unless you wanted your computer to freeze when downloading them. After about the first two months i gave up on the camera just in time for it to break. this is not a very good product that has low features. i strongyly suggest that you not buy it."
5,Great low-end digital,I have an Olympus D-360 that I am very impressed with as a snap-shot camera for adults. I bought this Kodak for my 10 year old daughter for her birthday. Perfect choice. I'm sure the camera will pay for itself with what I save on film and processing. Great little camera for learning and quick web-pix to Grandma.
2,Always just a bit off...,"This is a good little camera for the price, don't get me wrong. But the thing that bothers me about it is that you are always compensating to get the actual shot you are looking for. Even though the lens is right under the eye hole, it seems to take pictures right, left, up, or down of that point and so when you are trying to use the camera for life's little events, you can lose a lot of shots!The quality of the picture isn't that great either. Alright, but not great.Let's put it this way, when I wanted to take pictures of some jewelry I was listing on an auction site, I took better pictures with my scanner. Nothing flat, we are talking rings here, and that's just a bit sad to me."
2,Not very EZ,We bought this camera as a first digital camera for a photo happy kid to save film. Well the pictures weren't all that great and not all that bad even in low light but the software etc certainly wasn't easy to use. We wanted to be able to click on a thumbnail and see that picture but no you hace to save all of them first. Just too much hassle for a first time younger user. Also if you paid over 49.99 you were taken . We got ours a our local Wally world for 49.99
4,Way easy!,"Very easy to work, download, review etc. . great pictures.. not the absolute best, but for the price great.."
4,Not much more than a toy - but a great toy,"For its price the camera gives an opportunity to experience the fun of digital pictures and making your own little movies. The camera takes low quality pictures that look a little grainy even on the screen. It can also connect to your computer as a video camera allowing you to record your own digital videos or use NetMeeting video conferencing.It's a lot of fun, relatively cheap and probably a good way to get started. Make sure your computer has a USB port available."
4,Delivers what you pay for,"Easy to set up and operate, this camera gives you what you pay for. It takes web and e-mail suitable pictures which are quickly and easily transferred via USB to your computer. The included software is well-designed and easy to manipulate. Negatives on this camera are: 1) No display to see your pictures. 2) No flash. 3) Fixed focus"
2,Shallow,"I felt the story was really shallow. There was no depth to the characters. We wait forever to find out what happened to Jessie's mother and then it was like the writer was tired of writting and just ended the story. There was nothing joyful about the book. It was all sad, nothing happy about it. The only likeable charcter was Bill (the Cowboy)."
2,Nice,"This book was okay. I recieved it as a gift. But to me, Jessie wallowed in self-pity way too much. It got pathetic. Many kids have gone through much more, and didn't whine nearly as much. It was hard to read through. You could guess what was going to happen in the 7th chapter.I think that it's cool that a male author wanted to write a book. But let's face it. He's a man, yet, he wrote from a women's point of view. Men think, act, show emotion, so much differently from women. If he wanted to write a book, he should have written it from a man's point of view. Because, obviously, he IS a man. Few men can be sensitive and emotional. But David did a decent job."
3,battery eater,"great mouse but i would recommend taking the batteries out after use - the cutoff switch doesn't work and you will be changing batteries everyday - otherwise, it is a great mouse for laptop use - i bought a refurb for $4"
4,A Personal Holiday Classic,"This is a good album that I look forward to litening to each year. All of the songs are well done, and some of them are excellent, especially ""The Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy""."
1,Did not receive iten,"Amazon sent me email to review the item Pikmin 2 that I ordered for my son. unfortunately, I still have not yet received the item after more than a month of waiting. I would not trust Amazon, especially if involves the company Penny books."
3,elmo is ok,"It's ok but not ""wow"".I think it's to expensive for what you're getting.Wouldn't buy it again."
2,Looks fine...if you can get it off the backing,"Everything arrived in time and as pictured. After following the instructions to a ""T,"" I was not able to remove the image from the paper backing without ripping it. The instructions explicitly state ways to help remove it from the backing if it is difficult to get off, which we tried - multiple times and in multiple ways - and nothing worked. We finally had to get a butcher's knife and carefully run it between the now ripped image and the paper. Once it was on the cake, it looked fine, but there were some tears that were noticeable. It is not an easy-to-use product."
4,"Freedom to be Sheena Easton ""Pop Icon""","Freedom is Sheena's 13th album and was originally issued in Japan only back in 1997. I am glad to see that the US has finally issued the disc here stateside and It is good to hear Sheena voice again.This is a disc of Pop and R&B; songs that Sheena is best at. Her voice is older and yet still as strong as ever and is evident on songs like ""When you speak my name"" to songs like ""Let me go through this alone"". One of the standout tracks is a song written by her ""Love will make you wise"". This songs shows you she can write a lyric as good as any other artist today. Other standouts are ""Now that my baby's gone"" and a remake of Steve Perry's ""Foolish Heart"".Put the disc in you favorite sound system and just enjoy it.Peace,Sanatino"
4,It is wonderful,"Realy, I like the CD. Because I am form Argentina and here the CD was not edited. I recommend you listen the ""Misty blue"" song- Excellent. And the others. Thanks."
3,A mixed bag,"Sheena Easton's 1997 album, Freedom, is aptly titled as it is the first time Easton has both produced and written any of her songs. The results are quite telling. The three tracks she has produced, the gliding, well-harmonized remakes of ""Misty Blue"" and ""Foolish Heart"" and the power ballad ""Love Will Make You Wise"", are the most interesting on the record. Other pleasing tracks include ""One Man"", ""When You Speak My Name"" and ""Now That My Baby's Gone,"" which have a strong R&B backing and Easton's most powerful and warm vocals to date. What remains, however, is quite dowdy with ""Love Me With Freedom"" reaching a new low in Easton's career. Fans will no doubt be pleased and at the least the CD proves that record companies don't always know best. Let Easton have more control over her lyrics and production and you will have some of the best music of her career."
2,Another sub-average album from an excellent voice,"I can't begin to describe my frustration with the way Ms. Easton's career has gone. Due to hum-drum writing and poor lyrics, Ms. Easton has never found a writer's voice deserving enough to be the vessel for her own talent. Depressingly, Freedom is nothing more than another notch in the album belt. With the exception of Misty Blue, the songs are flat and entirely forgettable. And whomever recycled Modern Girl should be fired from his/her P.R. job! The only upside here however has to do with the continuing development of Ms. Easton's voice. It beckons towards the Blues and longs for another album of classics like No Strings. There is raw talent here, even polished. We, the listeners, and Ms. Easton just need some song lyrics worthy enough and large enough to resonate and have an impact. For whatever reason, the power ballad wanna-bes keep finding a home in Ms. Easton's musical repertoire. Give us a break and set her Free!!!"
2,A Major Disappointment!,"Being a big Sheena Easton fan, I can't tell you how disappointed I was with this album. Given that it is an import, even more so. When the CD opens with a children's chorus singing la la la la, I knew I was in trouble.Sheena's voice is a apppealing as ever, but the material here is very blah, very forgetable. Songs like ""One Man"", ""Misty Blue"", and ""Love Will Make You Wise"" keeps the CD from the trash can. These should be pleasant album tracks, not the standouts.This CD is an example of why Sheena doesn't have a U.S. record deal. She needs to reteam with Greg Matheson or Chris Neal; producers that made her successful and a star."
2,It's no Pell Mell...,"I never understood the title of this album until I bought a (Baldwin) Fun Machine.This is nothing like their work in Pell Mell, but might be of interest to late night insomniacs. Almost a modern-day Eraserhead soundtrack kind of vibe..."
4,Playful and relaxed.,"Even with hubby in the limelight, Stacy Kent still steals the show.Saxophone player Jim Tomlinson is Stacey Kent's partner both in a personal and a professional capacity. So, when recording his latest solo album, it was a logical step to call upon his wife's vocal talents as the cutting edge of an intimate small band set.""The Lyric"" is a wonderful journey through a selection of classic jazz standards.Stacey Kent and Jim Tomlinson fit together hand in glove and on ""My Heart Belongs To Daddy"", ""If I Were A Bell"", ""Something Happens To Me"" and ""Cockeyed Optimist"", her sublime vocals and his lush tenor are a delight.Stacey is relaxed, playful and has never sounded better.The stand-out track is the lightly buttered bossa nova of Antonio Jobim's ""Corcovado"" which sounds as good as the famed Getz/Gilberto version from 1963.Tomlinson also purrs through two instrumentals - Manha De Carnival and Outra Vez - like a well-fed cat. An essential purchase for all Stacey's fans."
3,A setback for Stacy,"Nuts. Hubby Jim Tomlinson and his tenor sax and percussion contributions intrude on this collection of 13 show tunes and Europen/S.American favorites sung by Stacey Kent... and Stacey is clearly the add-on.Her redentions of show tunes are awkward and out of place. ""If I Were a Bell,"" ""Cockeyed Optimist"" and ""Surrey with the Fringe"" are just not the kinds of tunes that Stacey can wrap that beautiful, enormously expressive and articulate voice around.At her phenominal best on other collections, Stacey sings each song as if it were written just for her. In this collection, she sings as if she's borrowing each tune from somebody else.Dave Newton on piano, Simon Thorpe on bass and Colin Oxley on guitar are as they have been on Stacey's other albums, superb. So is Tomlinson, when he isn't trying to push Stacey off stage.Get your own album, Jim. Let Stacey do hers."
1,not helpful,This book was useless and provided no real advice for someone seriously wanting to make a career change.
1,Save your money,This book is now old and outdated but even when it was brand new it wouldn't have been very useful. It doesn't provide any new or creative ways to use your JD.
2,Thin on new ideas,"Although a good starting point, I was disappointed with the lack of new information that hasn't already been covered many times elsewhere. It needs to be updated for sure."
4,Good Resource That WIll Make You Think,"When I picked up this book I knew that I had always had an interest in law, but was unsure if I wanted to work for a law firm. Before going to law school I wanted an idea of exactly what my options might be after school.This book helped me a lot. I have not made a final decision, but I am definitely closer than when I picked up the book. The two most helpful sections to me were the assessment exercises that helped me think about what skills I have and the last 2 sections on actual jobs available.If you just want someone to tell you what job is right for you then don't choose this book. If you want/need to think about yourself, your life, your skills, and what you want your job and your life to be then this book is a tool that will help you on your journey."
1,Repetitive Rehash,"This is a book like the dozens of other career change ones out there - you can find this information in publications from years ago, and with much better advice. No new information, and would only help lawyers who would lack the imagination to think of ""legal publishing"" or ""in-house counsel"" as career options. Truly unhelpul."
2,just poor,"very vague, unhelpful, i trashed my copy, not even worth reselling because I wouldn't want someone to waste their money on this. One chapter of the book talks about various professions people who are lawyers have ventured into. Some of the items are: restaurant manager, chef, erotic bakery owner....Seriously, anyone that is a lawyer/looking to be a lawyer find that last profession helpful? Probably not, pass on this book."
2,"Decent, but underwhelming","For the price, I wouldn't really recommend this book. If you're an avid Titanic fan and have read everything else it's a decent buy seeing as how most of the photographs that you see of the Titanic came from this man, but the pictures aren't very dramatic and it's not a good place to look if you want a good summary of the Titanic and what happened. I'd suggest ""Illustrated History of the Titanic"" for that. This is mainly just a collection of photos of some of the people on board. Rather dull."
4,chilling,photo's of ill-fated ship titanic is hidden tresure.the pictures are fascinating and chilling.the pictures of captain smith peering down chill you to the bone.
3,very good for a titanic historian,"As a Titanic Historian and a avid book reader I found this particular book to be a great reference for a person who wants to see life on the great ship. however the book was based upon father brownes photographs and since he took only a few onboard, the book is rather incomplete. but I still enjoyed it and still open it up every now and then."
1,Caution,"Despite the picture, these are NOT Energizer. They are a generic brand. I purchased these because they showed they were Energizer. Have requested a refund because of the deception. We'll see what happens."
5,Must Have for Every Plaintiff's Lawyer's Shelf,"I have seen David talk at a number of ATLA conferences/colleges. He always has great advice. This is a slender volume that reviews why juries give money, why juries hold back money and the current 'tech' on how to increase damages. He has also included sample outlines for opnening statements, closing arguments, and how to structure the case. I've had it for about a year and every case I work up, I flip through and review the good qualities and danger aspects of the case. This is the most useful book I have in structuring a case and setting a discovery plan. Whenever I speak at seminars or conferences I always push this book. This book has helped me a lot(His book on how to conduct focus groups yourself is great too! We routinely conduct our own focus groups for $300)."
5,Great book... but there is a new edition now,Fantastic book but the newer version has more information. The 2005 edition is red. Get that one instead.
4,"The Men who answered the ""Long Roll""","This work is a basic primer for studies on the foot soldiers of the Confederate armies of the American Civil War. Exhaustive research of primary sources, letters from soldiers forming the bulk of the material, went into Wiley's treatise. Wiley's books formed the base from which many ACW historians - starting with Catton - derived inspiration as well as information. Wiley is not a story teller of Foote's or Freeman's quality, nor does he offer analysis or philosophy on a level with McPherson or many others. However, Wiley's work has stood the test of time as a definitive history and memorial to the lives of the men of many callings who rose to answer the ""Long Roll"" for the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. Wiley did similar service for the men who served the Union, in his subsequent companion work, ""The Life of Billy Yank"". Wiley's books are basic cornerstones of the ACW student's library."
3,Don't rely on this book for everything you need,"Recently, I took a cross-country trip for six weeks and used this book along with several others to help plan our itinerary. It is informative and has some decent city maps, but gives very limited options for lodging and provides little detail on quality of hotels, motels, etc. Many prices and phone numbers are outdated- an unpleasant surprise!I would recommend using this guide only as a supplement - it has some good suggestions on things to do and see, but you'll definitely need other books along with it. For the money, there are better options out there."
1,Better luck next time,"Admittedly, it's the first time out for a whole-USA guide from those Australian backpackers, but this guide has a long way to go. Fine cultural information, but this book's write-ups are ambiguous at best, treating the best hostels in the USA the same as the very worst. True, these books are accurate, if by accurate one means ""not listing any hard information so that the hard information can never be wrong."""
2,What does this book inform the readers?,"This travel guide probably says more about the authors' perception of the US than what America is truly about. The book assumes that you are from a Commonwealth country (read: Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and to a lessor extent, Canada) because everything is compared with the broad Commonwealh culture. If you don't understand much of the Commonwealth culture (such as cricket) you may comfortably skip the entire culture section.Another thing is that some descriptions are incorrect. For example, it claimed that New Yorkers had ties ""back to the UK"" during the American War of Independence. In reality there was no country called the United Kingdom until 1801, well after the end of the war.So my advice: try another travel guide."
4,comprehensive and helpful guide,"I bought and use this book during a recent trip to DC and NYC. Advices and directions were right and extremely useful. Map quality has improved since earlier guides. Maybe, it lacks details about passes for local transportation (eg NYC) I recommend it over other guide books."
5,This makes me flail and spaz.,"Great Big Sea is a band that is best seen live, and this CD pulls a ton of the joy of seeing the boys live into one VERY exciting CD!It's all their best songs pre-Sea of No Cares and a few off of Sea of No Cares as well!Great Big Sea fans will love this release. It is absolutely terrific!"
1,"Only useful for a pit, not as advertised","I pulled this out to use it for the first time when my basement was getting water in it after a heavy rain. This pump is advertised to be used in flooded basements, etc. and no where in the advertising or on the box or in the manual does it say you need several inches of water to prime it and that it only pumps down to the 1 inch level. That is appropriate for a pump that goes into a sump pump pit, but not to pump out your basement floor. Fortunately I had a Wayne utility pump that was able to do the job. I would not buy this unless you are using it for a pit. I have requested a refund from the Amazon seller; we'll see what happens."
3,It's not stereo,"I bought this solely for ""Once Upon a Time"", and was dismayed that the CD is mono, not stereo. The quality of the recordings leaves much to be desired, as many of them lack the pristine quality I'm used to on a CD."
1,Cooking in 1920,"I ordered this book because our club was cooking like great, great grandma in 1920. This recipes were in existance then so we are making sirup."
2,Tooti Frooti,"I bought a bag of this to try and my parrots will not even go near it. I thought the smaller pellets would have less waste to them, so it was worth a try. I have bought other foods in the past that they ate, but didn't seem enthusiastic about, but at least they would eat it.These pellets smell like bubble gum. I have never purchased a food with such a strong smell. At least the food doesn't appear to be loaded with a lot of food coloring to the point it is bright in color. If you have a bird that doesn't seem to take to strong candy like flavors this isn't the food to buy."
5,Beautiful Sax Music for the Holidays,"For those who can't get enough Kenny G., this instrumental collection fills the gap. The sax soars and spirals through the tunes with light support by keyboard and percussion.The performers include Mark Douthit, John Hammond, Gary Lunn, Mark Baldwin, Bob Patin, Tim Akers, and Eric Darken. The Christmas music is treated very well and not overwhelmed. I loved it! The music is very subtle and contemplative."
2,Don't care for it - elevator music.,"Sorry to differ from the other reviews, but I was quite disappointed with this CD. I bought it in a bargain bin at a home improvement store at least 10 years ago and have only listened to it a handful of times.The music is very spacey, ambling and pretentious, and has too much added reverb. Many of the traditional titles are barely recognizable as being the song they are.Nothing at all wrong with the recording quality, but if you're expecting anything in the way of traditional interpretations of these familiar songs, you'll be disapointed too. I guess it's a matter of personal taste."
2,OK,"I received these in a great amount of time. However, when I pulled them apart the pictures stuck to the backside of the mat. It peeled it in several spots. I covered with my bowls during playoff parties but would recommend that something be put in between the mats at shipping."
2,Unreliable quality,"I bought several of these batteries. 2 of them are toast. They just simply won't hold a charge. :( Based on my experience, I'd say that it's hit or miss on whether you will get a good battery!"
1,bater will not hold charge,the batter i received worked good for 3 months then would not hold a charge.the seller would not return e mails. so i would have to give this a bad review.
5,An important book for young people thinking about life,"This book goes into the root of human problems, addressed to young audiences. Spoken with clarity, it can cause a turning point in a young person's life, as it did to me when I read it while at the university."
4,Interesting Read!,"This is a book taken from transcripts of lessons given to Indian students on the meaning of many aspects of life by Krishnamurti.Many, many topics are covered, for example, what is the root of fear, why are the poor happy and the rich unhappy, what is obedience, and the list goes on with many questions asked and answered according to Krishnamurit's theory on the aspects and meaning of life.For the person that maybe searching some life answers this would be quite an enlighten read and one that will hold your attention. It is very in-depth and will leave you with much to think about."
4,Different!,"This is a book taken from transcripts of lessons given to Indian students on the meaning of many aspects of life by Krishnamurti.Many, many topics are covered, for example, what is the root of fear, why are the poor happy and the rich unhappy, what is obedience, and the list goes on with many questions asked and answered according to Krishnamurit's theory on the aspects and meaning of life.For the person that maybe searching some life answers this would be quite an enlighten read and one that will hold your attention. It is very in-depth and will leave you with much to think about, question and wonder."
3,Schrade Deerslayer with Leather Sheath,Good product for the price. It holds an edge and is a good beginners skinning knife. I would buy another one like it if I had a reason.
3,Shrade Deerslayer,"The knife is sharp, but is made in China. No stamp on the blade to tell you where it was made. Identified by box."
5,Schrade Deerslayer Review,Great blade for a great price! VERY sharp and ruggedly made!It's a lot of knife for the money.
2,Not recommended,"Quite a disappointment for a laptop costing [price].Pros to this machine is obviously the big screen and the high resolution. But the hard drive is a royal annoyance with a constant crackling sound. Not only that, it seems to be constantly polling the hard-drive even when no activities are going on. As a result, while scrolling the cursor, it becomes jerky when the obnoxious polling happens on the hard-drive. I called Sony's helpdesk and have a walkthru reloading the entire system files and not to my surprise, did not fix the cracking hard-drive sound. The sound is quite obnoxious, reaching the level of a mainframe disk-drive. Unfortunately I bought this thru [a store], with no exchange, nor refund policy for computers other the the option of sending it to Sony to fix this problem.BIG DISAPPOINTMENT !!!!!!!!!!! Warning to those who cannot jump into the latest and the greatest...and ultimately will be disappointed."
4,Fun SF romance with interesting ideas,"In order to be a ""faster than light"" pilot, you have to remove your heartbeat by getting a continuous rotary pump in place of your heart. (perhaps inspired by the rotary Mazdas that don't seem to be around any more.)But what happens when you achieve the much coveted status of Pilot with a successful transformation, and then meet an intriguing guy that you really like/love who has an extremely strong time sense...?I read it many years ago, more than once, as much for the romantic attraction as for the drama and speculation about how we might modify the human body for various uses, from deep sea living to space travel... I think there's a sequel that continues the characters."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"In Vonda N. McIntyre's Superluminal, a woman has to undergo bodily augmentation and alteration in order to cope with the pressures of being a starship pilot, e.g. the ability to go superluminal.Don't want to be a cyborg? Then this is not the job for you, the whole flying around in space thing. You won't have to worry about getting a pacemaker though."
3,Good plot but doesn't have many sparkles,"Courtesy of A Romance ReviewHis Heart's Delight is the first book of the Braedons family, featuring Christy and Morgan's story. Christy is a little country girl without much experience in life. She always seeks advice from her elder sister, Joanna. Morgan is a charming bachelor with a sense of humor. He finds Christy' s laugh most attractive, so he always makes her laughs. He is also a perfect gentleman, although he wants to seduce Christy badly, he still controls himself. Ms. Blaney's first regency in the series has a good plot but it doesn't have many sparkles."
3,carrying case for in focus projector,"This is a very nice carrying case for the projector with one major fault. The bad is too small. I cannot use all the fancy packing that came with it nor can I carry a light weight extension cord in it. I need to use a second bag. However, it is much better than the paper thin bag which came with the projector itself."
3,More than slightly used and has a library code on it.,"It's a book I want for my class and am familiar with, it's just that it's more than slightly used...etc."
4,Hot Time in the Australian Outback!,"Gina Petrocelli, computer programmer, struggles to resist the charms of rugged station owner, Parish Dunford. The sparring between the polished city girl and the self-assured man of the outback will remind the reader of Margaret Way's always great, Australian romances.The seductions are hot, though the misunderstandings that keep forcing the couple apart seem a bit contrived. The descriptions of outback life and scenery enhance the story. I look forward to trying another in ""The Australian"" series."
5,I felt like I was in Australia!,"Parish Dunford is the sexiest Aussie around. He'll linger in your memory long after you finish Alison Kelly's BOOTS IN THE BEDROOM. And Gina Petrocelli sure gives Parish a run for his money! I highly recommend this romance novel with its witty, fast-paced dialogue and its utterly luscious sensuality. This is romantic entertainment at its best!"
4,Enjoyable,I enjoyed the book and am reading it again for the 2nd time. I was able to relate to the writer.
5,"thought provoking, entertaining and delightful","I picked up this book due to the title. I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I found it to be entertaining and thoughtful. I also found inspiration in this book as well. You don't need to have read the shape articles to enjoy this book. With honesty about her struggles along the way, anyone can identify with Courtney."
3,"Liked it, but...","I could definitely empathize with Courtney's struggles with bingeing, and I enjoyed her writing style; however, if my family (mainly her grandmother and twin sister - calling her fat and degrading her at every opportunity) were that mean to me, I would have disowned them. I keep waiting for her to stick up for herself. I haven't finished the book yet, so I'm hoping by the end she finally does (?)"
1,What Weight Loss? No inspiration here.,"This is not a weight-loss memoir. It is a badly structured tale of one whiny woman who refuses get help for her eating disorder, somehow thinking that dieting will help. She loses some weight at first, but then spirals back into disordered eating, gains it back and never comes back out.The worst thing (in terms of the writing) is that she admits to tacking falsely-hopeful endings on her magazine articles about weight-loss, and then tacks on the same kind of ending to this book.Sorry, Courtney, the book makes poor reading because there was no real development to your story. I hope you find a way to resolve that chapter of your life. When you do, I'd be interested in hearing about it from a more empowered place."
3,Not Your Typical Diet Book,"If you have ever experienced the daily struggle that is dieting, you will find a familiar voice in Courtney Rubin. Honest to a fault, she presents a diet journey unlike any other, and courageously says out loud the things we have all thought at one time or another. It's a relief to know that someone shares our pain. The only problem I had is that I was waiting for her ""aha"" moment, when she would at least get on the right road, and it never came. If you don't need to find ""the answer"", this book is definitely worthwhile, because ultimately, isn't it true that we all need to find our own way? And while you're finding it, isn't it nice to know you have a friend like Courtney struggling along with you? It certainly was that way for me."
2,"neuroses, thy name is Courtney Rubin.","I read the book all the way through, which I suppose is saying something. But from somewhere around page 30 through about page 230 all Rubin does is WHINE. On and on and on. Some of it is enlightening, and it did explain her process (which can at times be interesting), but for the most part it struck me as neurotic and extremely redundant. She also doesn't take much responsibility for her own physicality. Connections are important (i.e. mother, father and sister), and I know some things can be ingrained, but at some point we have to be accountable for our own lives.This book could have been about a hundred pages shorter.Sorry."
5,Great and insightful book,"I read Courtney Rubin's book on a cross-country flight and it made the time pass remarkably quickly. In a witty, insightful and humorous way, Courtney shared with us her struggles with food and her weight. Up until now, I have never read a book that so honestly deals with this topic. Kudos to Courtney for revealing her deepest thoughts and feelings to the world!"
2,"Kvetch, kvetch,kvetch---feh","I hated her column in Shape but I was having a fat moment and decided to read her book anyway and man, oh, man, it blew. What a whiny drama queen!All she does is blame and refuse to take any responsibility for the fact that her weight loss project sh^t the bed becasue she has no control over her eating. Wah. Po' Coutney. Have another Jumbo muffin."
2,Stop Blaming Your Mother - Take Responsibility,"I gave it two stars rather than one because the book did hold my interest throughout the entire reading. It is amazing to me how many people blame their weight problems on ""their mother"". Please enough already - maybe if when you were very young your mother fed you tons of goodies I could understand but after you left home to keep blaming your mother for what YOU put in your mouth is ridiculous."
2,Frustrating.,"This rack is very easy to mount, however, getting a bike up there is very difficult, not to mention 2 bikes. Very tight fit."
3,needs foam lining on hooks,"Was attempting to put the Saris Sentinal 2 bike rack on the trunk of my car. The instructions say to put the strap in between the hook and the car. However, when I tighten the straps with it wrapped around the hook, the strap becomes taut and comes loose of the car. Planning on buying some foam rubber to stick to the inside of the hook so I can actually use the rack without damaging my car from the hooks."
4,Not Exactly How I Thought,Did not hook up exactly how it said it would. Did not sit right over my spoiler (I have a 2002 Nissan Sentra) But was able to go under the the spoiler. Feels pretty secure. Had to strap it down with some bungee cords. Have not driven to much with it but if it does not work well while driving I will leave more feedback. Feels pretty secure.
3,Good at a price,"Decent rack at a good price, but there are a few drawbacks. Not enough space between the two bikes . It takes a bit of maneuvering to get them both on without having pedals and handlebars interlocking with spokes. Also, the inside bike hangs closer to my trunk than I'd like and I have a nice new scratch to show for it. Lastly , it could use frame stabizers. On the up side, it holds the bikes securely with little wobble. It's a breeze to install and remove. It's really reasonably priced. If I had it to do over I would spend a bit more to get a rack that overcame these shortcomings. If you're not going to use it a lot, it's a good buy."
3,Just ok,"I used this rack for a cross country trip and it didn't quite do the trick. Took constant adjusting and watching. Would be ok for short trips possibly, but its a pain to watch it the whole time."
4,Very easy to use,This rack is very easy to install and I appreciate that it is all in one piece. Great value for the money.
3,Only ok,"This is the first bike rack I've ever owned, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm pretty disappointed. My road bike is pretty light, but it's still a bit tricky to lift the bike up and over the poles (much more so with my mountain bike, which is a lot heavier). The real problem is with the fasteners--they each have 4 tiny holes that are meant to snap over 4 corresponding nubs, but this is easier said than done. I actually have to use my car key to get the fasteners in place (because the plastic is too rigid to push down), and even then, it seems too flimsy a mechanism to be secure. Plus, the bright yellow elbow joints are a real distraction in the rear-view mirror while driving. It wasn't a lot of money but, like I said, it's only OK."
3,bikes fell off!!!,"So, I'm pretty handy and I couldn't believe I didn't pull down on this rack hard enough to alert me because I drove through an intersection and looked in my rearview only to be greeted by nothing...the bikes fell off and I stopped immediately. The top straps did not hold tight, they were already threaded as I was told it ""was ready to go"". Once I tied the loose ends it worked fine and I was so glad to run into g & dj, who got me back on my feet. Once we tied the ends the rack worked great. I'm taking it back to the store that sold it to me to ask if the clasp is working as it should. My 2 cents."
5,Saris Sentinel 2-bike Trunk Mount Rack,I bought this rack in order to pick up a bicycle 160 miles away. I went to the Saris web site where they were able to tell me what rack to use for my car. The Sentinal 2-Bike Trunk Mount Rack easily and firmly fit on my 2009 Pontiac G6. My only comment is that I wish it had come with more tie-downs to better immobilize the bike. A couple of over-sized Velcro cable ties worked just fine.My other concern was whether this rack would scratch the paint on my car. The foam pads did a nice job of protecting the trunk and the plastic coated hooks left no evidence of the rack on the car. The rack easily breaks down to store in its original box. It was a good investment. I'm sure I'll use it again for other long distance trips with my bike.
2,Look elsewhere for highway driving,"I just got back from a trip from Vermont and spent much of my time pulling over to the side of the highway to reattach the plastic straps to keep the bike in place. At higher speeds (many of the highways have a 65 mph speed limit) the wind resistance on the bike caused it to go practically horizontal while in motion. Eventually the plastic strap would detach and the bike was precariously hanging off the rack. I only had one bike on it so I doubled the plastic straps on the bike and used an additional strap to tie down the wheel and frame. That was moderately successful. I stopped in Boston to visit a friend, bought a new Allen two bike rack and tossed this one. The Allen rack had ample strap slack to wrap up the frame and wheels so the bike did not budge when I drove back. Additionally, the Allen rack keeps the bike closer to the car, which I think helped with wind resistance.If you're driving local, this will work fine. For highway driving, I would look elsewhere."
1,this sucks,"no one should buy this for $11.00 for one pack because it is a horrible deal and whoever priced it this way was wrong. $11 for 9 cards is a total rip off and completely disappointing, not to mention the picture and description are deceiving, especially to young kids first entering the pokemon scene."
1,big disappointment,What happened?! I ordered this package of cards with the understanding that they would be EX cards. None of them were. They were not even any good cards. Total disappointment and misrepresentation of a product. Very unhappy!!
5,Carbon Filters,"Great price on these filters! In store they are almost $5.00 more, for the same ones. Am loving my filter and having the replacement pads on hand makes me feel even better about my purchase!"
3,Odd book,A rather odd book. Most of the time the author is carrying out a conversation with just two authors Nygren and Outka as if these two authors represent the summit of all that has been said or written on this topic.Also I find the way the author classifies love to be very odd. He defines Eros as the love for the sake of Lover; Agape as the love for the sake of Beloved and Philia as the love for the sake of relationship.He gives no hint that many other authors do not understand various loves by this criteria.
5,Great tool for hardwood flooring,"The Cepco floor jack is a fantastic tool if you are installing hardwood flooring and want really tight joints in those areas next to a wall where you cannot get a flooring nailer. Instead of using screwdrivers, chisels, or wedges to force the flooring together, the floor jack simply presses it into place with no bother and no fuss.I recommend using a 2x4 or 2x6 at least 36"" long against the wall that you are going to press against to keep from damaging the wall or pushing a single stud out of place. The wall jack can generate a lot of force and in the hands of a careless installer it could dislocate a wall or partition.While this tool is designed primarily for installing hardwood flooring, creative carpenters will undoubtedly find many was to use this tool to precisely move framing members. It is worth every penny that I paid for it.Pete BucyNC1, Inc."
4,"Good product for a ""non professional"" floor installer",Used this Quickjack to install about 450 square feet of 3/4 inch oak flooring. It snugs boards tightly together even when nothing else works and it doesn't damage the boards. I only gave it 4 stars because the handle interferes with the wall and could be designed much better. It is also priced a bit high compared to the other tools I purchased. I used it to install prefinished flooring and I had to be very careful that this tool didn't scratch it as I moved it around the room. All in all a very useful tool with a few issues that I noted.
3,Uplifting but limited,"This film readies you for more than it delivers. The concept, the humor, the relationships all point to greatness, but the ending is lacking. An opportunity for a meaningful nativity play was trumped by a flashy performance. Nevertheless, the ending did energize & uplift.One caution: the film repeatedly includes off-color dance moves performed (mostly) by children."
1,"Glass Soap ""dispenser""",This is my second review. I was very disapointed with this product. It was deceptively SMALL and the dispenser part didn't work. I ended up with a very small soda bottle with a decal on it which was not worth the price.
4,A book about love and heartache,"A really wonderful book once one is able to understand it. Set in Ireland the phrases are a bit hard to understand at first, but once over that the book is great. A must read for all women wondering what to do with there lives. The book gave me a lot of inspiration"
5,Excellent and Funny Book,"This, I think, is an excellent book on porn. He covers the classics - both the old and the new. The biographies of the stars are great. It's nice to know what those old divas are doing now! He also has a few sections on doing your own porno, if you're so inclined. Those sections, while not long, were fairly complete. The best part of this book in my opinion is the humor. This guy is funny. It's a good read for 8 bucks. Nice binding too."
3,The 'small' big book of porn !,"Im not that big of a porn buff but every thing in this book i already heard before.Nothing new to me unforntunentley ! I did not hate this book, i liked it very much for the 2 hours it took me to read it !"
4,"Like the cart, but not the Operator's Manual","Good quality cart but when reading the brief text in the operator's manual, I prefer to read the details of operating the equipment I purchased rather than getting quotes of biblical scripture.Thanks."
4,Worth the buy,This song is a great buy. Whitney Houston and Deborah Cox sound beautiful together. It's a wonderful song and I strongly reccommend this cd for a music lovers.
5,Fabulous 5,This CD is fabulous! I am not a regular R & B fan but this CD got my attention with the different changes and the build up of music. The light classical style mixed with the vocals that really sound alike was an awesome idea. Keep up the good work and looking forward to more projects like this.
3,roto zip,"worked as advertized, seemed to dull too fast, was a lot better than a hole saw on cement shingles. bit heated up way too fast, could have started a fire."
3,Gets the job done - once,I used this to cut a hole in lath and plaster. It made enough holes for about 6-8 normal electrical boxes. Unfortunately the bit was pretty much toast after that. It did a good job but by the end it was almost burning the edges of the lath. Not that durable but good enough.
1,Terrible movie,"Amazon did a great job, fast, safe shipping... But the movie is probably the worst movie I have ever seen... It's so low budget and acting is terrible... I was so excited after blood in blood out thinking man this will be awesome... MAJOR let down... I do NOT recommend..."
5,Vatos Locos,Great movie if you like Gangster films. It was a low budget but I realy liked the action and it had a cool movement. If you liked Damian Chapa in Blood in Blood out You will love this film.
1,Ang,Bought this movie for my husband since he was a big Blood in and Blood out fan but I have to say I also watched this movie and it was bad acting was horrible filmed very bad also. We were very disapointed:( Thought it would have been a lil better we knew it wasnt a part 2 to blood in and blood out but it SUCKED!!!
1,"There are ""A"" movies...""B"" movies...and...""What the hell movies""...and this is one of those.","Whoa! What up, ese?! Oracle', homies...what were you smoking when you filmed this? The plot line was terrible. The characters...unbelievable. And the editing was so Junior High School. This flick pales in comparison to such East LA classics as ""My Family""...""American Me""...""Blood in...Blood out"". I'm sorry, I was hoping that ""Vato Locos""...would be a keeper in my film library...but instead...I'm sending it to my home boy back in the Varrio to use it for target practice.OSO...Varrio Venice"
2,Just Awful!,"Bad acting, bad dialogue, just bad all around. I can't say I hate it only because it stars Damian Chapa but because it stars Damian Chapa, I expected better. This was just an awful waste of time."
3,Decent movie,"This movie was alright. It wasnt the best but it was still entertaining. If you like this type of movie, I highly and strongly suggest the movies ""Blood in blood out"" ""American me"" and ""Warriors"""
5,Great Book!,I had the honor of taking a short course at a software security summit from Robert Seacord. I would have to say it was one of the most informative security related courses that I have taken. This book encompasses the course that I took and does a great job of explaining what to watch out for when writing code.I highly recommend this book for any serious developer.
1,Not my cup of tea,"Recommended by a friend, but I did not enjoy the book. The author seems to place the crude perspectives of the jungle inhabitants on a moral pedestal. Great for tree huggers and naturalists, but I am neither."
1,Anthropology?,"I was certainly bothered by this book though not because of the graphic violence, but by the fact that this is really a christian apology. Under the guise of speaking through a Yanomamo shaman (now deceased), it presents a bleak view of constant suffering of this Amazonian tribe. Then, whites (nabas) bring Jesus to the jungle and everything is becomes wonderful.While pretending to be an anthropolgy book, it is really an attempt to justify the intrusion of Christian missionaries into the lives of ""primitives"" all over the globe."
5,an amazing true-life adventure into the world we can't see,"Wildly fascinating and extremely important, this is the book I will first recommend if anyone asks. I read this at the lowest point in my life, and I haven't looked at anything the same way since...being truly made aware that if the supernatural realm is that vivid in the dark, nearly-undiscovered Rainforest, how much more sly and effective are the evil spirits around us in this modern world, where we let them influence us with their lies by refusing to acknowlege their existence. This book not only changed my life, but helped save it. The stories are brutal, but hope is in the Truth that's delivered: there is a light more powerful than darkness!"
1,Dont waste your money,"I bought this game today, spent about an hour trying to get it installed, then couldn't even get it to run. After finally getting it to work I played for about 10 minutes and was so bored I quit. The graphics are horrible compared to games out there now (ie. myst, riven, so on), and the mouse movement was Way to fast. You use the mouse to turn, but just slightly moving the mouse over to one side or the other I was doing circles so fast my head was spinning. And there is no way to adjust it, that I have found. The music was bland, and it just didn't appeal to me in any way. Thank God I only paid [a small amount of money] for this game, and it wasn't even worth that. Perhaps if someone likes older games with not so great graphics they would like this game, but I think most people will find it a great disappointment."
3,"Yes, but...","The other reviewer of this book gave it five stars, calling it ""intelligent and top of the line."" Yes, it is a beautifully photographed book, and Stefandis is one of the great decorators of our era. But I was looking for a book that would help me decorate and design my new house, bought in 2002. And, alas, ""Living by Design"" is already dated. It was published in 1997 but was photographed earlier, AND IT SHOWS."
3,TERMINALLY CUTE FAMILY FILM,"This ultrasweet sequel to MIRACLE DOGS brings us two spaniels who have the miraculous ability to heal, and how they stumbled into a young boy's life. Adults may find it saccharine-heavy, but it is a good film for the family to enjoy together. A good cast consisting of Charles Durning, Janine Turner, Patrick Muldoon and an over the top Lesley Ann Warren bring some life to the pedestrian script, and all in all, should be entertaining as family viewing."
2,Movie Review for Miracle Dogs II,"I bought Miracle Dogs and Miracle Dogs II because the concept of dogs helping with healing was interesting to me. Unfortunately, the movie was focused more on a boy keeping some puppies hidden in order to keep them. The healing concept was only briefly touched on and not a major element in the plot. The movie is definitely geared to young people (7-9) and very wholesome. It is a good family movie to share with young children."
5,DVD for kids that like dogs,"Purchased for Grand Children who are at the age of loving dogs, they liked the story and watch it often though I don't know how they can watch it so much.Came well packaged and on time, was priced right and in the condition stated by the vendor."
3,"Terrible script, terrible acting. Unfortunately, my toddler loves it.","The original Miracle Dogs movie had a bad script, but at least the acting was decent. Miracle Dogs Too, however...ug. Plus, it's called Miracle DOGS, but the dogs are the least seen characters in the entire movie.There are a few familiar faces:The guy obsessed with ice cream? Steve Urkel from the TGIF show Family Matters. Doctor Jeff? He played Jeff, the older guy that Kelly met at The Attic and broke up with Zack for on Saved By the Bell. The red haired guy who works at the Curiosity Store? He starred on the movie Firestarter with Drew Barrymore. Nurse Natalie? She played the part of Kelly in the original Miracle Dogs movie. And then there's Lesley Ann Warren.As much as I hate this movie, I'm giving it a three star because my daughter loves it. And since it's a kids movie, her opinion is really the one that matters."
4,Dick Tracy book,"This book was very interesting from a cultural/historical perspective, and arrived quickly, in good condition, well packaged, with the dust jacket intact. It had the slight odor of old books, but not offensively so."
2,Not Renoir's best by a mile.,"Woman on the Beach (Jean Renoir, 1947)Trite, predictable noir-esque romance, not at all the kind of thing one would expect from a top-notch director like Renoir. Simple plot: military man (Robert Ryan) is suffering from what we would now call Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Gets scared. Wants to marry his girlfriend (Nan Leslie) immediately. But then meets seductive, sexy married chick (Joan Bennett) with blind ex-painter husband (Charles Bickford). Becomes obsessed with sexy chick (at which point girlfriend becomes almost a cameo in the film, rather than the main character she's set up to be; this is what I mean when I say you don't expect this level of filmmaking in a Renoir movie). Confrontation with husband. Repeat as necessary. You know the drill. I wonder if Renoir just needed the money? Some not-half-bad acting, but under no circumstances should you be expecting another Rules of the Game or Grand Illusion here. **"
4,an inspired album...,"I think this album is much better than the last two she's put out (excluding Strange Little Girls). I'm still in the listening phase, trying to develop a sound opinion of this album. I like that she has more acoustical piano, a reason why I fell in love with her in the first place. I'm not crazy about all of the back-up vocals she does, but it's not a big detraction. I need more time to formulate a solid opinion..."
5,Tori 1 - Sarah 0,"A few years back Tori and Sarah were tied. Tori with To Venus and Back had reached soaring hights, and Sarah with Surfacing was flying pretty high herself. Before that Sarah had the lead with her amazingly wonderful Fumbling towards ecstasy, though some may argue that Tori was on a par with Under the Pink.In any case, right now Tori has proven to be more talented or maybe just more inspired. Over 70's minutes worth of high quality soaring music, incredible voices, unbelievable piano, profound and uplifing all the way through. I know Sarah has the talent, but she's obviously not as inspired as before, maybe she should have waited a bit more?? Or maybe she'll make up for it next time..In the meantime, Tori has not failed."
5,This album solidified me as a true Toriphile...,I admit it... I am... Words cannot express how much I love this album.
3,"i love tori, but...","the first cd i ever owned of tori was ""from the choirgirl hotel"" and i absolutely loved it. her music was a refreshing change from the usualy canned-pop-star vocalists that dont even have the talent to play their own instruments or write their own music. every song was original and different. with ""scarlets walk"" i was incredibly disappointed. the songs are all good, but there seem to be about three tunes throughout the whole eighteen tracks. her singing is as gorgeous as ever, and her skill at the piano is still there. even the lyrics themselves are good... but the cd, all together, leaves something wanting. if you are a first time tori listener, i would not advise this to be your first cd of hers. on the other hand, if you know what she is capable of, this cd should be worth it, because all the songs sound good, if not different."
4,Tori's best work,"Tori's timeless ability to renew her coming-of-age laden tunes are even better this time. Her talent remains singular in her songwriting and musical attainments. Old Tori lovers everywhere, buy this CD."
4,downward spiral?,"Do you remember Boys for Pele? Absolutely amazing. But after that album, I've noticed a trend towards less interesting songwriting from Tori. Do other people notice this too?Well, she seems very happy anyways. I suspect that might be the cause of this trend."
3,Is this all?,"After listening to this several times, I was left feeling something was lacking. It's as if she ran out of inspiration. 'Gold dust' is the notable exception. The lyrics and music complement each other to the degree of 'Winter' & 'China' from Little Earthquakes.Also, her live performances were a let down from the past. She had no fire.......... not even a small spark. As if she couldn't in fact, relate to her songs either."
5,Buy it,"If you listen to this and don't love it to bits, then you must also think that George Bush is an intellectual giant."
5,****,"Though nothing is ever going to match ""Little Earthquakes"" or ""Under the Pink,"" this album is pretty darn good. Admittedly, many of the songs do sound somewhat similar, and I think this is because they all end in about the same way. However, I like this album because it doesn't sound overall like anything she's done before-- no synthesizer like on ""To Venus and Back"" and ""From the Choirgirl Hotel,"" and no ""screamers"" like ""strange little girls"" and ""Boys For Pele."" Like any artist, Tori has a right to grow through her career, and her fans shouldn't bother waiting for another ""Little Earthquakes,"" because it ain't gonna happen. I like the direction she is going in this one, and I can't wait to see where she goes next."
1,I rather run far than to take a walk with this album....,"Tori, what have you done to yourself?!?!? This album just [bites]. I just saw you in concert, and you are so pretentious it makes me sick. All the songs sound the same, I mean, Wampum Prayer has to be the most horrible song ever made on earth. Yes, there are one or two good songs, ""Wednesday"" and ""Gold Dust"", but the rest are just horrible. I miss the old Tori, bring her back. I would NOT recommend this album. The style just has changed so much. :("
2,A Disappointment to this Tori Fan,"The first few tracks are vintage Tori, but most of the album drones. Overall, it does not live up to Tori's previous achievements."
2,My opinion about Scarlet's Walk,"Well guys, yesterday I have bought the album and enjoyed the Tori's voice and talent. What can I say? Her ""A sort a fairy tale"" is a real diamond masterpiece, I've ever heard of all songs that I've listened this year. It's really cool! Many thanks to her for it. The song ""Taxi Ride"" also very-very good!But the over songs on the album are nothing :-( My advice to you, just find in MP3 these two songs and save your money to buy whole album! ;-)Have a Happy NEW YEAR! :-)Cheers,Ejen"
4,Pleasantly surprised,"To be honest, I think Tori really lost her audience on her last two albums, neither had that Tori feel to them, that Kate Bush meets Joni Mitchell and slaps her in the face kinda thing, but this album really does make you a fan again. There is a little ""Choirgirl"" mixed with a ton of that ""Strange Little Girls"" sound (which did let this album down a little), for example ""Pancake"", but tracks like ""I Can't See New York"" and ""Taxi Ride"" (tho that track could of easily fit into that whole ""Venus"" sound) do bring this album to life, it's a good thing that the gems on this cd are spread out, it tends to send you to sleep. A lot of dull tracks here, but I still rate this album highly, I really did enjoy the bigger part of this album and the good weighed out the bad for sure. This album is for the die hard fans, not the casual."
4,What a return to Form,"This CD is such a comfort after the last two. I was afraid that Tori was on a downward slope after the horribly inconsistant ""To Venus And Back"", and the less than stellar cover album ""Strange Little Girls."" This album is probably my second favorite album by her behind ""Little Earthquakes"" and ""From The Choirgirl Hotel"" which are tied for my number one spot. However, in many ways ""Scarlet's Walk"" is a better album than both of those. I say this because this is the first one of her albums that I can honestly say I love every song. For me, Tori's biggest weakness has always been her inconsistency. There were always a few tracks on all of her albums that either screamed b-side, sounded as though they didn't belong, or were simply bad songs. I can honestly say that isn't the case with ""Scarlet's Walk."""
4,Beautiful...,"Tori Amos is not recognized enough for her huge talent,in my opinion. She has brought so much feeling into music that no pop songstress could ever do. This cd belongs in the collection of pretty much any music lover...if you like poetry and great musical sensibilities, then go for it. It dont matter if you are a long time fan or a new comer to Tori-just try it! Pretty much anyone can relate to at least something she has to say. Plus its like she just keeps getting better and better, and noone has a voice like her. I bought this cd the day before halloween, and have barely had time to hear it, but i am so impressed that i have a feeling it'll be in my stereo for a while..."
2,Bad for Tori,"If you like Tori's early years, you will not like this. It is boring and a real disappointment. Tori can do better and she is getting worse with each album. She is becoming mainstream and her lyrics reflect that. She would rather go platinum than write a song that could change a person's life, like ""Me and A Gun."" I truly wish I could say this CD is good, but my heart and mind say it is the worst one to date. Good concept, poor music."
3,I can't do this easy listening ..,"Maybe once I'm getting closer to 40 like Tori, I'll be able to enjoy this, but right now at this time in my life - this CD is not for me.In order for me to take time from my life to analyze lyrics and the deeper meanings of this 'sonic novel', I have to at least be hooked by the songs. Unfortunately, I feel as though I'm listening to a single one that is an hour and 15 minutes long. There just isn't enough musical variance for my taste.I will say that this CD is better than Venus and SLG - that's it."
3,"A Couple of Gems Here, Not Much Else","This 18 track album, in contrast to some of her previous work, is so slow and mellow that it almost puts you to sleep. If you're not a Tori fan right now pass on ""Scarlet's Walk"" and buy ""Little Earthquakes"", an album in which nearly every track is strong. There are three stand out songs on this album---""Carbon"", ""Sorta Fairytale"" and ""Taxi Ride"". Tori fans should buy this only to add those three songs to their music repetoire. If you're looking for an overall strong body of work, ""Scarlet's Walk"" is sure to disappoint."
2,Tori is now a Muzak fixture.,"Not in the mood nor do I have the liberty to write a dissertation on this CD.Ok, been a Tori fan for over 10 years. Done the shows. Done the obsessive-tori-is-a-god bit. While this CD isn't absolute crap (as SLaG is), it is dull. Boring. Monotonous. It's a 78 minute long song.Maybe I do expect too much. However, I guess I'm spoiled cause Tori did deliver in the past.I'm moving on. Bye bye Tori."
3,Tori's Walk,"This is an excellent CD which continues to grow on me with repeated listenings. I don't know that it is my favorite of her works, but it is definately one of her best. The special edition comes with some very neat extras which would make it a nice gift."
5,Beautiful Beyond Words,"Tori Amos is truly one of the most talented artists of all time. Although she did have a couple disappointing albums, in Scarlet's Walk, Tori Amos is back. While Little Earthquakes is still my favorite Tori Album, Scarlet's Walk is incredible and beautiful beyond words."
5,"Full of musical intelligence, magic, wisdom and grace","In my opinion, this is Tori's best work since I fell in love with ""Little Earthquakes"" in the early 90's. You can listen to this CD one hundred times, stare at the lyrics, and still find new, fascinating things hidden inside. My personal favorite is ""Carbon."" Other faves include ""Taxi Ride,"" ""Your Cloud,"" ""Sweet Sangria,"" and ""Don't Make Me Come to Vegas."" I definitely recommend spending the few extra bucks and getting the Limited Edition w/DVD for us hardcore Tori fans. The map includes lyrics and tracks the places where she wrote each song, which is very interesting. The DVD is also beautiful to watch and listen to."
2,What happened?,"I have been a huge Tori fan for many years. However, when I listened to this album I was thoroughly disappointed by it. I feel that it is too radio friendly. I would recommend for those of you just getting into Tori to purchase ""Little Earthquakes"" as a starter album. If you like it, go from there."
5,Loved every last song!,"I have never had this happen before, and had to write this review as soon as I could to document this strange event. This CD has 18 tracks, and I was so shocked that I LOVED EVERY LAST ONE! I have never had that happen before...there are always two or three songs on a CD that I just can't get into, but this one pleased me from beginning to end and back again. It ranks right up there with Little Earthquakes for me and can't recommend it enough. I hope you will give it a try and that you will enjoy your walk with Scarlet. There is little else to compare and I doubt you will be displeased."
5,trail of blood and amens,"Tori Amos tells the true history of America through the eyes of Native people using the traditional American Indian storyscape, map of the land through story and song. Brilliant modern take on an ancient story form. As a Native person, I was so touched by her rendition of this way of storytelling, especially since she herself is a mixed blood. It gets a little long towards the end but it is such a good album, I could care less. key tracks for me are Gold Dust, Virginia and Your Cloud. Your Cloud is about separating the People from their Land via the Trail of Tears and how is felt like it was like separating water molecules. Genius work and I praise my Native sister."
5,Incredible album!,"This is a must-have Tori album (or any album for that matter), as they all are! There are no words to describe how incredible this really is."
4,"Not so edgy, but still touching","I've been a die hard Tori fan since Little Earthquakes, but I prefer her more edgier albums like ""From the Choirgirl Hotel"". This album is beautiful, though much more subdued than previous works. We can see that Tori has entered into a state of content with herself, and her life. Gone are the furious rants of prior albums, instead replaced by quiet, reflective tracks that soothe the soul. She still maims with her cutting words, and inspires with her uplifting vocals. A definate must have for Tori fans."
5,Very harmonical and intimate,"I judge it the best album since Little Earthquakes. Though I indoubtedly love all her other works, yet - Scarlet's Walk is finally that piece of classical Tori that links us to her talent and music. That 'surrounding' voice of her, bosom lyrics, emotional and harmonical piano sound... this album shoots two aims at once - it cheers up and saddens at the same time."
5,Miss When She Made Albums Like This,"I feel like this was her last truly great album in its entirety. Yes, there are a handful of good tracks on each of the albums following this one, but she's just not putting out this kind of comprehensive quality anymore. Its a shame. I feel like all her best creative efforts have gone into her musical The Light Princess which she's been working on this whole time. At least, I hope that's where all her effort has gone. Scarlet's Walk is considered by many to be Tori's masterpiece as a fully grown musician at the height of her talent in both creativity and production value. This album also boasts her very best packaging of any album she has ever released. It came with a map of the US with crayon-colored paths marking what cities she was driving through while writing each song. That's pretty cool. This album is amazing for road trips and a companion to the book American Gods by Neil Gaiman. The book and record reference each other shamelessly, and I love that."
3,"A Good Album, But not her best","I have been a HUGE fan of Tori since Little Earthquakes, been to 3 concerts and all that jazz. I have to say I found this album to be lacking something. It may be inspiration or a passion she has shown on her previous albums. It seems a bt flat and a throwback to her earlier music (almost like a bite for fans who have complained about her progression into more complicated music mixes which I for one love). It's not a bad album, I play it more aften than not as background music when I am working, but it doesn't move me like her previous albums. It's too even keeled, there are no ups and downs that make the listener feel the emotion behind the music.Her last two releases to me, have been kind of disappointing... Is she not giving 100% to her music now that she's setled down and started a family? My thoughts are the noise in her head has settled down and she is finding hard to find her own thoughts in such a calm silence."
4,our tori is back,"many tori fans who have found some of her recent efforts leaving them wanting will find themselves in love's little way-back machine when they hear this graceful, earthy, dreamy album. tori has taken the sweetest elements from past works and weaved them carefully into something new and truly elegant. i love this album."
2,"Somewhat uninspired, ma'am","Well. I have to say all of Tori's previous CDs have evoked wonderful emotion in me. This, however, does not. The whole CD makes me feel that I have one song on repeat. Discordant, haunting, beautiful melodies that are signature Tori are missing from this album. I find it uninspired, a la the great American trek or not. I do not deny her talent, and this CD gives inkling of her enormous gift. Still, it leaves much to be desired. I'll be waiting with baited breath for the next CD, because this one is a skip on the journey to Mt. Everest."
2,Not forth it,"So very empty. There's barely nothing left of the Tori music I fell in love with. Melodies are dull and lyrics, I think, un-Tori-like."
1,i don't need to hear EVERY thought tori has,"painful as this is, i couldn't stand this album. a wounded cat offers more originality.this album has no heart. it feels fake. i've seen tori in concert many times, and unfortunately, saw this album in concert too.hey tori, you're weird, quirky, and all, but enough. now you're just being nonsensical because you're lazy.purple monkey dishwasher.doesn't cut it."
1,Most pretentious artist ever,"Tori Amos is a great pianist and nothing else. Her lyrics are horrible and her voice, which used to be good, is so groggy. Tori tries to be different but she just ends up being kooky. Check out some of her lyrics or interviews to see what I mean. Tori should have packed it in after To Venus and Back, but no! We're going to be subjected to her nonsense for years to come. Scarlet's Walk has a few good tracks (A Sorta Fairytale, Carbon & Virginia) but the rest is terrible. Give it up, Tori! You stopped being good six years ago!"
5,Exellent!!,"This latest release finds Tori wonderfully blending the old with the new. There is plenty here for the seasoned Tori fan...who remembers just her and the piano without the constraint of an underlying regular and rhythmic beat...as well as her newer style incorporating a very well put-together group of souls who obviously are ""on the same page"".It has been interesting to watch the evolution of this very brilliant performer over the years...and as usual...she has released yet another piece of her soul for us to enjoy...."
4,She's Back!!!,"Though not opposed to growing and changing, Tori's last two offerings (Chiorgirl and Venus) smelled a little too much of techno (read: disco). Tori has finnaly returned to where she belongs: behind the piano. For those who liked Earthquakes and Pele this is a great selection."
3,Less than the original,"Ms. Lavin recommended this updated version of her earlier ""On a Winter's Night"". Sorry Christine but I think the original was much better. Better recordings and a nicer balance of music in my opinion. If you have the choice, buy the original."
5,Brothers Four at their best,"I bought it just for the BMOC, but learned to really like much of the other LP album as well. So, it not only takes me back to the sixties, but gives me something new as well."
4,Very pleasant. A Good Feelin' CD,"After hearing about this band on KUT Austin this CD reminded me of how I felt while listening to early Nancy Griffith, Shawn Colvin and Allison Krauss. Although they have very different styles I knew that with their unique voices they would make it as great artists. A good feeling CD"
4,These guys are great...but,I love these guys. saw them with kasey chambers - twice - went back the second time just to see them. This cd is good but i feel like the big studio washed some of the sparkle and energy from their music. The first two cd's - which have many of the same songs - have something just a little extra that makes them 5's and this a 4. Still the music is great and robin and cruz are both super - got to chat with both of them at the house of blues in new orleans. solid.
5,"Poignant, Cozy, and a little bit Sassy","I first heard Robinella's CD playing in a printing press in Knoxville, Tennessee, and had to find it immediately. It feels like a favorite shirt you've had for years. Holds on to you from the beginning with hints of Allison Krauss injected with Anita O'Day. Sweet and heart-wrenching."
3,Mainstream Country,"I heard the first cut of this CD on the radio and thought it sounded interesting (a bit ""alternative/folk/bluegrass), however the other songs are a little too mainstream country for my taste."
3,Not Quite What I Was Expecting But Pleasant Nonetheless,"I expected to hear a unique hybrid of bluegrass and jazz. Instead this CD features a bluegrass song, followed by a jazz song, followed by a country song, followed by.....you get the idea.Not bad, although a little underwhelming. I agree with the reviewer who was surprised this band is on a major label. The band has its bluegrass and jazz chops down, that's fer sure, but something is missing...there's absolutely no tension or nothing adventurous.Still, I like it and recommend it."
5,Refreshing and original,"I found tihis CD to be both refreshing and original. Being a great appreciator of music and that it enriches my life, I love it all; classical, R&B, jazz, rock, bluegrass even some pop... You name it, I'll give it a chance to move me. I'll admit that I can be a harsh critic. So I was enthralled when I heard a short ditty and interview on NPR recently. I decided to gamble on the CD and after just a few listenings found myself really liking it. Even my 6 year old daughter can hum a lot of the tunes. This music is hard to describe because it has moments of reminding one of bluegrass, jazz, country, and even Ricky Lee Jones-ish at times! The music and Robinellas' warm voice do not take long to grow on you. There is one other CD that reminds me of this wonderful group and that is ""KUKURUZA,"" (meaning ""corn"") a Russian folk bluegrass band that is also well worth hearing. Thank you Robinella and the C.C. Stringband. I look foreward to hearing more in the future!"
1,Can't cut the stuff!,"I needed tool to go through plaster for a remodel project. After buying the high dollar plaster bit, I could only get about 3"" until it burned the bit up. Not exactly what they advertise for this everything tool. I did try the tool on other materials and found it could only do a good job on drywall (a little more messy than a key hole saw). I think the tool is a rediscovered drywall tool with a nice handle. A case for the tool would have been nice so when I toss it to the side it dosen't get damaged under the building material that I cut with a real saw."
4,Roto Zip Original,"I have used this product in its original form for over two years. I find it to be very good for cutting drywall and other light materials. It does not do so well on heavier materials, such as ceramic tile. It can also be difficult to control during use if you do not concentrate on the direction of the bit rotation. It does work very well for cutting out electrical boxes and circles for recessed lights in drywall. For these reasons alone it is worth the purchase price if you do a lot of this kind if work."
1,If I could give it NO stars.....,"I read a lot of reviews on this tool, some were good, some were bad. So I thought I would give it a try. First of all, it's the loudest tool I've ever heard, my wife told me to turn it off so she could hear her table saw. The main complaint in the reviews I read was that the bits break very easily. I have a lot of experience with tools, I read the directions, went very slowly, let the bit do the work, and after five minutes, SNAP! I took it back in an hour. I was cutting poplar, a super soft wood, about 1/3 inch thick. If it can't cut that, what can it cut? Also, when it was cutting, it cut extremely rough, if would take forever to sand away the rough edges it left. I would recommend a jigsaw as a much better tool. I have never broken a blade on a jigsaw. And it cuts much cleaner. And you can get on for half the price of the rotozip."
2,Pattern Cutting,"I am really disappointed with this tool when it comes to freehand cutting of a 1/4"" plywood template. I could not follow my pattern line with a smooth cut no matter how much I practiced. This tool cannot replace a saber saw or band saw when it comes to this kind of application. No way could I duplicate what they do in their TV commercial."
3,Slapstick Comedy,"I first ran across this movie on the Spanish channel one night. It caught my attention because it was obviously a comedy. My Spanish is very limited, but I could follow what was happening because of the B grade slapstick. Many people find this kind of humor stupid and not worth watching. You can choose English if you want; but if you have had some high school Spanish, you may wish to watch that first and get the real feel of the movie. Spanish insults can lose their punch in translation."
5,so smooth!,"this is a really nice cd as it combines two great Four Freshmen albums, lots of good tunes. no other vocal group has ever come close to the smooth perfect blend of their harmonies."
5,"""Vintage"" P.D.Q. Bach","I was first introduced to the ""artistry"" of P.D.Q. Bach in the late '70s via ""The Wurst of P.D.Q. Bach"" compilation. That album is long gone, so, now that I'm going through my mid-life ""transition"", I'm rediscovering good ol' P.D.Q. via the original Vanguard recordings. This is, to my knowledge, the first of the P.D.Q. Bach recordings, and it is truly a side-splitting classic. The cantata, ""Iphigenia in Brooklyn"", including Schickele's introduction, is to me one of the funniest recordings of any kind ever made. The ""Concerto for Horn and Hardart"" is also absolutely hilarious. WARNING: if you listen to this while driving, make sure you're on a road with a good, wide paved shoulder. You will likely need it so you can pull off to recover from a fit of hysterical laughter."
4,a legend begins,"I first met PDQ Bach in The Intimate PDQ Bach and An Hysteric Return. When I spotted this I had to have it. The Concerto for Horn and Hardart (whatever that is) is wonderful, as is John Ferrante. However, I prefer The Unbegun Symphony to the Quodlibet. I listen to a classical station, and I can't hear Mozart's Jupiter Symphony without expecting Ta-ra-ra-boom-dee-ay!"
3,Better books out there,"In much of this book, there is a very strong emphasis on exactly what worked for Dave Scott. This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, and in some cases isn't, but I find it more helpful to hear the coach's perspective as opposed to the athelete's perspective. The reason why this is important is because a coach will very often know the difficulties that wide ranges of people face during triathlon training while the athelete really only has to deal with his own challenges. The other thing to note is that the information is a little dated.It did cover a lot of territory though... There are also some good gems that I found as well as an underlying emphasis: 'your training should as accurately as possible reflect your race'.(My rating should be 3.5)"
5,Dave Scott's Triathlon Training,Pretty good so far. Haven't finished reading it but it has a lot of detail about how to sent yourself up for success in triathlons.
3,"Too much information, needs to be boiled down","I have read every Triathelete magazine for 2 years and thought this book would be great. However, it has to much info and the training schedules are too complex for the ""non- professional"" triathelte. This is more an encyclopedia on everthing he knows about all three sports"
1,Do you like split tongues?,"I'm installing about 1000 sq ft of 1/2"" bamboo flooring, and I found the Stanley Bostitch Flooring Stapler Model MIIIFS to be awkward, the staples were prone to split the tongue of my flooring, and the base plate often scratched the new finish. I gave it a couple of rows to see if I was too critical, but I'm not--I'd rather do floors manually than use this tool.Of course I'm not going to do the floors manually, so I borrowed a friend's Porter Cable Flooring Cleat Nailer (FCN200) and fell in love."
5,WORKS GREAT and EASY TO USE,"Having never installed a hardwood floor before, this Stapler made it easy. Even my wife, daughter and son-in-law had no problem installing the hard wood floor sections. The first two strips of flooring and the last 4-5 had to be done using a finish nailer because of hammer swing and staple magazine. Heavy duty equipment and well made."
2,Really small,"For something being advertised as a ""Long Beanie"", I am extremely surprised at how short this hat is. I guess for the price it is good, but I would NOT recommend buying this product."
2,Not good quality. It's ok. Good for the price.,"I bought this to replace my white burton beanie. This one is just low quality and the fibers stretch and soon enough it doesn't fit very well anymore and just doesn't look that good. Buy it if you just want something cheap, and it's fine for that. But to make it your main snowboarding beanie for example, you would be better off spending more and getting something that will last more than a month."
3,"Visually Apealing, Conceptually Empty","Polynesian Odyssey is the VHS release of an IMAX film. The locations and sets are stunning, but amount to nothing more than a series of shallow snapshots. The story of the polynesians' exploration and habitation of the Pacific goes completely untold. I'm donating my copy to the library.We avoided the Polynesian Cultural Center (producer of the film) for years, assuming it was just a tourist trap. Now we consider it a must do on Oahu- better than Disneyland as theme parks go."
3,Great seller!,"Great seller. Book arrived on time in great condition. This is not a typical dream book. I find I do not use it much. It is an interesting read. Instead of relying on a book, I write my dreams down and pray to see what meaning God will tell me my dreams have."
3,"Sorry, this AIN'T the complete works...","I think that Rich Kienzle must have written his review based on the good faith that this set would include all of the Delmores' Bluebird and Decca sides. It does not. It's a good hefty collection of their pre-war material, but there are many important sides missing. The Columbia 1931 disc is not there, and most of the Decca sides are absent. Some Bluebird B-sides are also MIA.This is rather shocking for JSP. They are usually so thorough in their reissue boxes. I'll grudgingly buy this, because I know the remastering will be good, but don't believe for one moment that you're getting the whole enchilada. If you're curious as to what these guys sound like, or like 'em and want 4 hrs of their music, go for it. But there's many sides left out. :( Maybe Bear Family will get off their arses and finally do the Delmores right."
5,Delmore Brothers Box Collection,"I have a few Delmore Brothers songs from what I friend of mine gave me. I have been a lover of the real true classic country music for just a short period of time, 25 years. I just received this Delmore Collection last week in the post and it is the best collection of Delmore songs any person could want. It covers all their different musical styles with flair. If anyone is contemplating on adding this to their collection I would highly recommend it. It is the Delmore's at they really best. To me a five star rating is a bit too low. I would at least give it twice that. It should be in anyone's classical music collection. I really highly recommend it. Perfect work."
4,High speed smash and grab,Well depending on where your grabbing it can be slow. But if it's got firewire like most Macs it's fast and with just about all computers now having at least USB you can get files from just about anywhere. I have it partitioned half Mac and half PC and at least the Mac reads both so I can easily transport most of what I need for 2 computers and be set to download anything I need from anywhere.
5,sounds great,I bought this product because I was losing sound quality when I was playing my HD DVD's on my 360. I have a first generation 360 and I had to turn my stereo system (1000 watt) all the way up to hear the movies at a desirable level. I hooked this up and noticed an immediate change the sound is crystal clear and I only have to put it on 20 as opposed to 50 to hear anything. I would recommend this to anyone who wants better sound quality without upgrading their entire stereo system.
1,came in and doesn't work,"The item arrived and the hydraulic does not work - The over all construction seems good for the money, but yet to use it."
2,Not A Ghost Story DVD!,"I bought this DVD after finding it on a search for St. Augustine, Florida. The area produces more than its share of ghost stories and I wanted to have a DVD of a few. This DVD was more about history and only had a brief mention of St. Augustine. I was very disappointed and returned the DVD."
1,Not impressed...,"The first problem with this cd is the singing, it tends to be very monotonous. It sounds like the same little girl's voice on all songs. Then after we played it a few times, the layer of vocals was erased! Now, we just have the instrumental version of the songs. Very strange, this has never happened to me before. I guess the monotonous voice problem is solved..."
4,The hooded Hawk Mystery,"This book was interesting because it was exciting about the pigeons, the way the criminals were catched, the bombing of the Hardy home, and the falcon. I'd like to have one of those. This book may be four stars, but it can still be considered one of the top ten, and is definitely one that all fans can not miss."
2,Change of Heart,Published in 1954 - As a child - I rather liked this volume. I read it once as an adult and was very very bored. The Hardys seemed to professional to my liking in this one. First book to contain interior artwork - so it is a hallmatk of the series. The Hardys are given a Peregrine Falcon to aid them in solving this case. Not much to say about it other than it was sub par. RATED C-
1,90 minutes of awful,such great actors in such a terrible movie. Don't waste your time or money. This has to be one of the worst I have ever watched and the ending leaves you wondering why you wasted your time. I would give it no stars if I could.
1,I expected more,This movie was so predictable and boring I didn't watch it to the end. I have a very high tolerance for sitting through movies regardless of the quality -- Not this time. The only other movie I bailed-out on in the last year was Yes Man.I like Val Kilmer but his performance in The Chaos Experience was poor at best. This is a renter or wait for it on cable. There are so many better movies for the price.
1,Contrived. Idiotic. Pointless.,"I know Kilmer likes offbeat roles, but this one reaches new heights..or depths, as the case may be. His eye twitching and facial contortions vary from ludicrous to absurd. Assante does the best he can with the role. Eric Roberts starts OK, then he too gets carried away with his role. Check this out at your local library before you spend your hard earned money on this piece of junk."
2,Low class.,Val Kilmer should have stayed home. Only money could have made him accept this part. A waste of time.
3,C'mon ...its not THAT bad,"This movie doesnt hit on all levels but c'mon Ive seen worse. Val Kilmer delivers the goods. So does Eric Roberts. The plot was better than most ""direct to dvd"" plots. Hey, I finished the movie...the story held my interest. Ok, its not TOP SECRET, WILLOW, TOP GUN or REAL GENIUS. The 80's are over. Val is just getting started.I smell a comeback."
1,Worst Val Kilmer's movie!,The story reminds me of SAW. The dialog is poor and the execution even worst. I watch the movie because I like Val but this movie does nothing for the actor that performed incredibly in Tombstone and the Saint. Do not watch it is terrible.
3,Worth a watch,"Could be better written for sure, not a lot of gore, though what there is pretty real looking, mostly a mind playing movie. You think it's all in his head then it's not, then you not sure. Pretty well shot, nice camera work. I'm not a big fan of Val Kilmer but he plays a physo global warming professor quite well. I think some better writing would have lead to some better overall acting but it's still not too bad. I'm probably biased since this was the first movie shot in my Hometown Of Grand Rapids after the Michigan Film incentives passed but it's quite well done for a budget of only $7 mill. It's nothing like the SAW franchise but that is the best way to describe it, a eco not very gory saw."
3,Fooling a world,"A bit boring stuff of semi-naked strangers (actually, does being completely unrelated attend a steam bath of mix genders???) truthfully depicts reality of madness surrounding a modern time natural climate change as the privileged academics did fool commons with threats of ""human- made earth environment disaster"" for mere personal gains.Not much to watch but some nice bodies struggling for the air."
2,"Why, Val, why?","Kilmer and Assante do their best with this oddly written thriller. I don't mean odd in a good way.Zero suspense, poor story-flow, and a laughably bad ending makes me want to one-star the effort. However, Val Kilmer and Armand Assante manage to elevate the production to ""curious"". The victim's introduction scene in the steam room will be your challenge; if you can get past that, you won't be too disappointed by the time you suffer the end - you know the letdown potential is fairly high early on.There are several ""uncomfortable"" moments which are surely worth something, but there are no shocks for the horror fan, and no neat twists or dialogue for the intellectual thriller crowd.The soundtrack (Don MacDonald) stood out, and Grand Rapids natives will be interested to see home on the big screen. Otherwise this is hard to recommend to anyone but a die hard Kilmer or Assante completist."
1,help I'm locked in a steam room and its really boring in here!!,"Let me put it this way...I would rather spend the day at work than watch this movie again. I would rather spend 2 hours in the dentist's chair than watch this movie again..I would rather go have my colon examined...I would rather wait on line at the bank..I would rather shovel snow..I would rather look at ugly baby pictures..I would rather write long winded pointless movie reviews about terrible, contrived, painfully boring movies.."
1,I those two hours of my life back!,"Dont waste your time or your money. I LOVE Val Kilmer and I almost cried at how bad this movie was. The ending, especially, is so stupid."
3,Much too average,"It just did not hang together, as is true of so many films.On the positive side, the photography was sort of artsy, like of the people in bathing suits in the sauna. But most of the film was so poor that it made the artsy flourishes seem pretentious. Too much gratuitous violence and blood. Also on the positive side it was fun to watch an overweight aging Kilmer play an intelligent schizophrenic who was overdue on his meds. I think he overplayed it, but they have to do that in Hollywood films for the mass audience, and looked at that way his acting was fun.Not one to rave about!"
1,Worse than Idiotic,"Ok you know a movie is horrible when you keep looking at the clock to see how many minutes are left. It had two good actors Val Kilmer and Eric Roberts so I kept waiting for it to have some redeeming quality. It didn't. It doesn't. Like another viewer said I want my two hours of my life back - it is that bad. The plot - well if you could call it that - moronic and makes no sense. I would tell you what the plot was but I honestly don't know. Something about killing people in a steam room to protest global warming.Unbelievable and gratuitous violence. The whole thing is disjointed and stupid.The acting bizarre and terrible. The ""ending"" topped the rest of the movie which I didn't think was possible in being ridiculous and fittingly nonsensical. I was saying thank god it's over. This may be the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen a lot!"
1,This really a bad movie--Skip it!!!!,"Why is Val Kilmer in this movie? He should know better. I guess he needed money because he doen't belong in it. its way below his level of professional ehtics. Senseless plot, bad acting, hard too follow and to sum it up, it is one bad movie. Avoid this one---Skip it please!!!!!!"
1,Who would pay for Makiwara?,"If you want a REAL Makiwara, MAKE ONE~! For example, Just wrap a thick phone book with a Duct tape would make an excellent Makiwara."
5,Eagleson has done it again!,"I loved Eagleson's first album ""Don't Wait Up"", so I just had to get this one, even though I was sure he wouldn't be able to do it again. Boy was I wrong! ""Bipolar Bear"" is even better! From start to finish, there's not a bad song on it. It's obvious that Eagleson's songwriting has grown both emotionally and musically, and the production quality is impeccable. It's almost impossible to tell this is an independent release... and it's hard to believe Eagleson isn't a huge star yet."
5,wonderful,Wow - what a great CD. Was very impressed with the quality - and can't think of one song I didn't like. It is even better than the first CD.
5,Gotta Like Mike!,"Michael Eagleson is officially my new favorite artist. Where is his recording deal? That aside, this is not some guy singing in his garage ~ Eagleson is the real deal! Bipolar Bear is one CD you won't have to skip a track on to get to the good stuff. It's ALL good! You won't find better lyrics (and ones you can really relate to). He can tug at your heart strings, make your reminisce, or flat-out make you laugh. The best part ~ there is NO mindless filler and no songs that repeat the same two phrases over and over and over. What a concept. This is what music is supposed to be like. The vocals pull you in accompanied by tight backgrounds and awesome accompaniment.BUY THIS CD ~ YOU WILL LOVE IT! You should also check Michael Eagleson out live ~ did I mention he's the real deal?"
4,Inspiring,book vividly portrayed the love these girls had for September and what determination can accomplish.my interest was heightened because one of my daughters loves horses. Good for any young horse lover.
3,Even for an old horse book... meh.,"I got this book because it was free for a day. Even so, it wasn't especially worth the time to read it. There are excellent older horse stories out there - I'm not against books that were written in the 30s, 40s, 50s, etc. It's not the lack of technology that makes the writing fall flat. The premise is okay, but the horse stuff makes me wonder if the author ever actually rode a horse. That said, maybe the book would be okay for a non-rider who doesn't realize how ridiculous it all is."
4,Lovely,"Haven't had the time to finish this book but I do honestly like it, I always try to read new things"
4,A Horse called September,"Unfortunately, last time I read this book I was 9 years old. Regardless, I can still remember it very clearly and it was also one of the most touching books ever - it introduced me to the concept of people changing, and friends growing apart. Along with the obvious 'love for a horse' theme, there is a powerful tackling of a fading friendship, which is heart-wrenching. I would love to read this book again but I just can't find it anywhere!"
5,Loved it!,"Story of two young girls that have always been friends even though they are from different social classes, and the horse that changed their lives. When one girl gets sent to boarding school she leaves the other girl in charge of her horse. Both girls love the horse but as the other girl makes new friends away at school and finds a new horse to love things change for their friendship and for the horse. An excellent book that I would read over and over again."
4,Great Realistic Badass Russian Gangster Flick,"I started watching this, not expecting much, but the actors themselves quickly pulled me in...these guys ended up seeming to wander around Eastern Europe, bumping into other local crooks and gypsies and women, and the girl herself, well she's the star....I sure wish I could find her in something else...but anyway, this movie rocks along: prepare to be pleasantly surprised and to wish whoever made this would get cracking and make another one..."
1,Just a bad movie,"We ordered on a Sunday night to watch with the family, Russian with English subtitles, in-laws could understand Russian too. It turned out to be the worst movie we have ever seen. We had to turn off TV after half hour. Do not waste your money."
3,"Hmm, something lost in translation",A standard bloody shoot em up. Dready looks at Eastern European underworld. A bit depressing with several really good scenes.
3,A neat scope- but for low magnifications only,"This is a cute little scope, and certainly the smallest automated observatory available. But be forwarned: That short-focus 60mm scope is not in the same league as Meade's similar-looking ETX-90,or even most 60mm refractors. The short focal length means that trying to use magnifications much over 40x-50x will result in severe color fringing. It's a fine little package for viewing many deep sky objects, comets, and for low magnifications of the moon. You can count the moons of Jupiter and Saturn with it, but don't expect Hubble-like views of the planets, most of which will appear as small dots.If you understand the limitations of this scope, you'll enjoy it. If you're looking for more detailed planetary views, or in exploring a great number of deep sky objects, look to a larger scope."
4,the best money I have spent and the many $$$$ i spent later.,"I got this telescope for no particular reason. I had no interest in Astronomy or any thing closely related to star gazing. My back-ground is banking and investments. However, I bought it to start a new hobby. Low and behold, My free time began to disappeared and i was a full-fledge convert of the star-gazing cult. to make it simple it is a great gadget to pull your leg but no a particularly good piece. The software that comes with it is exceptional and indispensable."
1,Very Disappointed!!!!!!!,"I purchased this item as a gift for a very eager young man. We could not wait to get this scope opened, when it arrived it was missing important parts including the owners manual. My nephew was heartbroken. We PDF the manual from the meade website (40pages) and we still could not get the scope to navigate it just points upright. I will never purchase anything from this merchant again. All the merchant can tell me is it was never used and still in the box and it was checked by a professional. That professional should retire."
1,"It struck me with awe at first, then with ugh...","After several hundred dollars, I've discovered that this telescope is pretty much useless. An avid star gazer, I would have been better off purchasing the cheapest model at the local department store. I was sold on the idea of the ""auto finder"" but after reading the instructions and following them. The auto tracker still does not prove worthy. What a piece of junk. The nice thing about it is you can see the moon - oh...and it looks like a really cool telescope....ugh!"
2,"Good concept, bad game","I enjoyed Dreamcatcher's idea for the game, but it wasn't a very good game. My main complaint is your character moves WAY to fast when you try to move around with your mouse, even with the slowest setting on. It has alright graphics, but I believe it doesn't have that great of an interface.If your REALLY desperate for an adventure game to play, go ahead and buy this one, but let's not count on it being on the top ten great games list for awhile."
3,Egypt was ok,I've played games like this before and it was ok . the graphics were good but it was hard to get around the village and the temple . But beyond that it alright.
2,Graphics are terrible,"This game sounds intriguing. The graphics are terrible and dark. Maybe 4 or 5 scenes to the game. Puzzles are not good and the game is very short. The title sounds like it would be interesting. The game is nothing like the title depicts. Just 2 stars from me. In fact, maybe 1 1/2 would be better."
3,pretty cool but not what i thought,i have a very old computer (OS XP) that this is did run on but it won't run on Vista or Windows 7. it was ok but nothing like the computer software available now.
1,Game Would Not Run on Win XP Pro,"I would love to have played this game, but was very dissapointed when it would not play on my XP-Pro System, which has top of the range sound and graphics cards. Total waste of money. If I could give it a zero rating, I would."
5,First love memories,"I heard the We Five play this album in 1966 at a concert in Boulder, CO. I got the vinyl version the next day. I took my first REAL love to the concert. I can close my eyes, listen to this music and be back there with most of the emotions, just not as intense. I later received a ""Dear John"" from this person while I was in military training in Mississippi. I enjoy the memory of the music and feelings of love I had at that time."
5,A Voice of Distinction,"Bev Bivens has one of the most distinctive voices of all time. I would place her in the company of Petula Clark or Judith Durham of ""The Seekers."" I have looked in vain for a used copy of ""You Were on My Mind"" for years. My original album wore out years ago. It is a testament to this group that it is virtually impossible to find any of their old LP's. Five stars is hardly adequate for the brilliant, soaring harmonies on this CD. I recommend it to anyone who would like to spend a few moments reminiscing about an age of fresh-faced innocence when war was in history books, drugs were in pharmacies, and sex was a budding rose with the petals still intact."
3,"Where is ""There Stands the Door?""","I love We Five and have everything by them from 1965 to 2002. Collector's Choice usually does a great job, but how could they have left the original band's final single with Bev off of this? ""There Stands the Door""is a psychedelic, raga folk-rock masterpiece and arguably the best thing the band EVER did.As much as I love the Signe era Airplane,this single blows them out of the water. It has droning Rickenbacker 360/12, electric banjo and Bev. WWWWWWWWWWWWWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYY couldn't they have put this song on? I can't believe it was copyright difficulty. This set could have been so much more. Instead, to get a good copy of this song you have to search and search the net for the 45 rpm on vinyl. Just try to find a reasonably priced MINT copy. Good luck! Such a shame! Such a masterpiece of a single..it should be on Nuggets."
5,The best 13 bucks you'll spend this year...,"I was fortunate to see We Five in person at Yuba College, CA in 1966. Three weeks later, I shipped out for the Southeast Asian War Games. The sound, depth, and range of Beverly Bivens' voice stayed with me, as well as the group's arrangements featuring the then-new electric ""San Francisco Sound"". I bought a copy of You Were On My Mind in a PX in Japan, and memorized the entire album. I still have it and regard it as a prized posession, even though it shows the scars of being played hundreds of times on less-than-studio-quality equipment!Make Someone Happy has about four outstanding cuts, the rest are merely wonderful. If you remember the mid-1960's this two-album CD is for you. If you don't remember the mid-60's this is an excellent way to get acquainted with the transition from popular folk to folk-rock.To any We Five members who may be out there: I'll be eternally grateful for your helping me hang on through a very rough time in my life."
3,we five cobo,We five combo cd.The first part of cd was good second partb of cd not that good. Shipping time was good considering it was ordered on the weekend and over the holidays. Was very happy with Ammason.
5,Once upon a time,"The '65 Senior Prom. Cruising Foothill or Holt Blvds. The Giant Slide in Glendora. The Orange Julius across the street from school. Playing our guitars in Baldy Canyon or at the beach. Vietnam was far away. Drugs were only heard about not seen or tried. It had not hit yet. After '67, it would change. Listening to the We Five on this CD brings this back and makes me want to return."
4,"""You Were On My Mind"" continues to lift my spirits.","""You Were On My Mind"" is a tribute to the innocence, optimism and especially the energy of the time it was written. When it is played every few months on the Oldies radio station, my spirits are lifted just as they were when it was played regularly during my sophomore year of high school in Bluffton, Indiana. Thanks to those who have made this available on CD."
3,"Great Music, Lousy CD transfer","I was so excited to receive this CD, mainly for the first one, which I used to own on vinyl, but also to hear their versions of Get Together and High Flyin' Bird, songs I'm somewhat a 'collector' of. I'm not criticising the original studio recording, but I've heard plenty of archival music that's been cleaned up, and brought back to life in a quality manner. This thing just sounds like the publisher was out to make a buck, and spend as little money as possible making it sound better. The hiss is instantly noticeable, and something unnecessary in today's world of digital filters and so on. Having said that, I'm not sure what to tell people who really want to have this. There's still lots of great music, you just need to get used to hiss and crappy sound. Be forewarned I guess about anything this label puts out."
2,"Great book, wrong binding","while the story and illustrations were great, I was expecting a hard-bound copy but a paperback arrived. The book was to be a shower gift and a hard-back copy would have been more appropriate."
2,need more episodes,If you have the first 4 available seasons you dont need this. I am patiently waiting for the remaining seasons. Wish they would get off their butts and release the remainings seasons.
3,love the one with mork,my favorite episode is on season 5. robin williams as mork i think was the funniest thing he was in. mork and mindy was not a funny show but mork on happy days was hilarious.im waiting for season 5 so i can get that episode.
2,A wonder Action Thriller,"its bad,not readable and does not have a flow. the author is trying to show off her profficiency in english rather than involve the reader."
2,Not for me...,"These sandals were not comfortable, they felt stiff and the straps cut into my feet. They looked okay, but that didn't make up for it. Returned them."
4,roto-zip bit,"this is really a great tool! it works great for light duty work,such as ceramic wall tile and 1/4 inch cement board.a little expensive though."
3,Not good on large floor tile,"I read several good reviews on this product, but they all seem to relate to wall tile. I found that the bit performs poorly on large floor tile. ..."
2,Not good for floor tile,I thought this tool was the perfect solution for my tiling project. Heed the warnings about not using it on floor tile or thick ceramic tile. I burned up a blade trying to drill through floor tile. It worked to make an irregular cut in the floor tile before it was installed but it took FOREVER. It was actually quicker for me to drive to the hardware store and have them cut the tile.It did work great on the cement backer board. I just noticed the diamond wheel for cutting tile and I am hoping that will be better.
3,Good Value,"Nice looking edition for the price. Will look good on your shelf, but anyone really looking to get into Poe will be better served with an edition that has some footnotes. Poe's heavy use of French and Latin had me running to Google to figure things out."
5,Revis !!! A Sure Cur Above The Rest !!!!,"All i can say is that Revis is surely gonna become a great band within years !! I have heard many many hard rock bands.. but none matches Revis.. they have come up with an Unique Rock sound !! All their melodies and riffs are different.. This is Commendable For a Debut Album. Rockers who make great songs by their 2nd or 3rd albums will be surprised by how Revis had managed to get almost 90-95% rite abt their music in their first release itself !! Now , we all can imagine how Awesome their 2nd Effort would be !! iam sure they r gonna beat everyone out there very soon !! All they need is a Little more radioplay ..coz they r still like an uncut diamond !! Believe me guys They r different.. iam not saying this just for the sake of it..!!!All the songs are very good and Revis has a Stunning singer i.e Justin Holman ! Hes much much better than Eddie Vedder !!I hope they reach the top sooner or Later !!!"
4,pretty good,"i bought this album like many others did after hearing them on the daredevil soundtrack. their sound, to me, reminds me something of nickelback. although i tend to like these guys' style better. anyway, this is a powerful debut album. tracks 1 through 4 are GREAT. its at track five where the cd starts to suffer. tracks 5 through 9 arent anything special. track 10 and 11 however.. are wonderful. i can honestly say track 11, looking right through me, is my favorite song on the cd.. yes i know its rather short (only about 2:30 run time) but i can really relate to it. after it ends there is about 30-40 seconds of silence and then a instrumental song i guess you could say? its pretty good. all in all this cd is only 10 bucks at all best buys so you can't really go wrong. i look forward to their sophmore album."
4,Good,"This is pretty good, even though the singer isn't the BEST in the world, he does a good job. And I disagree w/ a previous reviewer: The Exies have an awesome album and shouldn't be ignored, either. Anyway, check Revis out."
4,Listen-worthy,"These guys are certainly entertaining. I actually just saw them earlier tonight performing live as an opener for Evanescence, and I was very impressed. Their live show is very energetic, and that energy is certainly mirrored in their CD. If you get the chance to see these guys while on tour, take it up. It's worth your time. :)"
4,Great Straightaway Rock - This band deserves mass Radio-play,"What a great album. The only disappointment is that clocks in at well under 60 minutes. While the album is not technical, it will move you with it's moody songs and catchy hooks. Even if radio stations don't have the courage to play it, give this album a try. If you like the Goo Goo Dolls and/or Lifehouse, you will spin this disc over and over. Go Revis!"
4,Being original...,"is always good. Especially with your debut album.With Places For Breathing the young talents from Revis present both originality and a solid mature sound, which is never lost in the world of the modern music, and impresses surprisingly well.Recognizable melodism and appreciatable heaviness, with a strong and passionate vocals are what really works in this case so efficiently that Revis can count on succeeding in the fight for a popularity, with no trace of doubt.Caught In The Rain, Your Wall, Spin, Seven, and Living Rooms are the best examples to show how good a new born music talent can be, and how good once again Don Gilmore is.The really good buy."
5,Original lyrics and great sound,"First heard a Revis song (Caught in the Rain) come out of a computer game and when I heard samples of the album I decided to give it a go... Good choice! This is an excellent CD with a good combination of solid, strong lyrics with variable paced melodies, Revis really know how to set the mood of their songs. Highly recommended."
3,Should have burned it instead...,"Don't judge a book by its cover- or a CD by its first single!I must admit that I am not a grundge rock fan or a fan of fuel or related bands, but I know good music when I hear it and Revis is BORING. Don't get me wrong, the first, fifth, sixth, eight, and tenth songs are worthy of praise. But the rest of the songs on the album literally start off good and strong, but around a minute and a half later the song goes downhill faster than sh*t through a goose. If you are expecting the same drive and originality that the first single had you will be sorely dissappointed.Don't get me wrong this CD for $10 is a great deal, but if you have high hopes, drop them now. Or burn the it."
2,Boring After First Song,"I'm not exactly sure if this band has sold out, but I read in a chat room that their original material was more underground. Anyway, their single, ""Caught in the Rain"" was very promising. It's just too bad that none of the remaining tracks equal this song, in my opinion. Not even close actually. The sad part for me is that on paper, this band should be much better. The lead singer has a unique voice, and the rhythm section sometimes is very solid. I just didn't hear anything of substance that would make me go out and purchase the CD again. After listening to the album about 1/2 dozen times, I just couldn't take it anymore. Hopefully, Revis will create better riffs and add more bluesy grooves to their songwriting in the future, because they do show a lot of promise. Sorry to differ with the other reviewers, but there are much better new artists out there like Audiovent, AFI, The Used, and Ben Kweller that do this much much better, and sound a lot less ""corporate."""
1,Enough with the recycled grunge,Nothing makes this band stand out. The greed of record companys trying to make a quick buck is evident. They sound exactly the same as a million other bands. If they ever find their own style who knows?????
2,This was just HORRIBLE,"Revis huh? Think Creed. And we all know how Creed blows. Therefore, so does Revis. But at least Creed had some catchy songs - but Revis doesn't even have a particularly good rock beat to it either."
5,Loved It!!!!!,"WONDERFUL!! I was searching all over to find this CD. My husband stumbled over a song by them and he loved them. I had looked at all the stores in my area and none of them had it. So, I was happy to come to Amazon and be able to find it! I would definitely recommend this band."
4,Underdogs,"From what little I gathered from the 45 seconds I spent browsing through the previous reviews, this band is no more. If you do in fact remember their hit song 'Caught in the Rain' and enjoyed it or found it catchy, this album will not dissapoint you. I really thought it was going to suck, and bought it on a Warehouse going out of business sale only knowing about their hit track. While I think 'Everything After' might be their weakest track, the other tracks are great. It's a great alternative rock band that didn't neccesarily break any boundaries or set any records, but a solid artist to check out, and I found it refreshing to listen to an album where almost every song was good."
3,The bad boy,"He has much better songs than the ones in this albun. When he did ""Los Rompediscotecas"" he had other good artist doing songs with him. The artists on this CD are not as good."
1,Basura!,"This is why reggaeton is grabage. First the name of the CD is The Bad Boy, and all the songs are about love and girls. The beats are the same, all the same beats all the time..........is like bubble gum music. and by the way this ain't hip hop."
2,"Good story, nice pop-ups, poor layout","The book has a nice rendition of the classic story. The pop ups are very nice and entertaining even after multiple reads. The main issue I had is that the black ink print is often placed over dark areas of the artwork making it difficult to read. For people like myself who have vision problems, it makes reading the book a difficult chore."
2,Too many errors in array design (tchevysheff),"I teach antenna course and have found that students get confused when problems are incorrect. At least 2 problems (6.40, 6.46) design Tchevy array with specifications that are impossible to meet. The solutionary is wrong too! The required SSL of 30dB is never attained 'cause when you verify the visible region of T(z)doesn't reach sidelobes (z<1) so don't meet for given d and N. Need to increase spacing or N. This is serious bad training for students. In addition, the author use of beta for phase-shift instead of alpha is missleading and confused with nomenclature for k = 2 pi/lambda. Other aspects are very good, but needs color and photos."
5,An excellent text on antennas,"Any one who have had an introductory course on electromagnetics may use this book either as a reference for an antenna design or as a perfect learning material. Balanis' clear, informative language, enhanced with many illustrations help the student to understand the subject easily. Due to its wide range of topics, the book is of invaluable help for an antenna designer. The diskette provided with the book includes FORTRAN codes for many practical design problems and frees the reader from complicated formulas. A must have for any enginneer involved in the subject!"
4,Well organized and easy to follow,I used this book in a graduate Antennas course. I found it to be well organized and the most thorough of the three books on this subject I have used. Equations and their derivations were easy to follow. Problems were clear and followed the level of introduction in the text. All necessary material was clearly introduced. I would recommend this text to any professor looking for a good solid antennas text.
3,It doesn't brighten/dim,"This lamp module is compact and easily programmable. However, you have to get past the 5 step installation and operating instructions and then to note number 3 before you learn that this module is not capable of responding to bright/dim commands."
2,Doesn't work unless you buy another Transceiver,"I bought this Screw-in ""Socket Rocket"" and the ""Eagle Eye"" motion detector, but apparently I now need to spend another $20 for a transceiver to make this system work. The info available did not make this clear when I initially ordered these components, so be aware before you order! I'm giving it 2 stars for that lack of information and the additional costs that are now incurred to find out if it works."
1,Should have paid attention...,The songs on the CD are not really sung by the original singers. A disappointing buy. The music is barely tolerable. Fortunately I didn't pay much for it.
3,Not bad,"I won't bill myself as a connoisseur of 60s folk compilations, but this one isn't half bad. The real stars are Doc Watson, Flatt & Scruggs, and Mississippi John Hurt whose version of ""Candy Man"" is unequaled in any other Hurt collection I've heard (and I now own four). Joan Baez, Odetta, and Pete Seeger are also in rare form here, and you're likely to enjoy cuts by lesser-known artists whose records casual folkies are unlikely to own. Unfortunately some songs that were popular in their day (e.g. ""You Were on my Mind"" and ""Walk Right In"") now sound awfully dated to those of us born after '65. A less important problem is that the styles represented on this CD are so wildly divergent that no matter how you arrange them, it's hard to find a sequence that really flows. All in all, I recommend buying this CD. If you already like some 60s folk music, you may be introduced you to other artists whose music you will enjoy."
5,helped me fall in love with folk,"i borrowed this cd from my dad a while back and taped some of the songs i liked at first, and excluded others for lack of patience. so while i haven't had the opportunity to thoroughly examine a few of the tracks on here, some of them i loved and discovered particular artists from. my standout picks include ERIC ANDERSEN - VIOLETS OF DAWN, ODETTA - JOHN HENRY, RICHARD AND MIMI FARINA - PACK UP YR SORROWS, JOSE FELICIANO - LA BAMBA, and PETE SEEGER - EAST VIRGINIA BLUES. some of the songs annoy me, particularly anything with joan baez (her voice drives me nuts!)... the song WALK RIGHT IN by THE ROOFTOP SINGERS is rather dated and whatnot as someone said elsewhere, but i like it anyway.i recommend this set, but not all of it's good."
5,MUST for ALL Who Deal with Children,"This is a MUST book for teachers, administrators, counselors, and parents! I have a PhD and a Masters in Counseling. This is one of those books that makes life easier when working with children that need redirection. It is common sense, but when a person is not objective, then we often overlook strategies and methods that work well with children. Disciplining children at home or at school is generally by trial-and-error anyway. Why not take the guess work out of the equation."
1,"Stop, Save Your Time and Money","Waste of time. Waste of money. This book is a compilation of tips for the single traveler, but does little more than spew common sense and websites at you. It's ridiculously simple and unnecessary. I can't imagine that anyone who has ever traveled (alone or with a group) would need this book."
5,Practical travel advice and great stories all in one book!,"This book is a great blend of practical advice for the solo traveler and inspiring travel stories from the author's myriad of fascinating trips. The book covers where to go, all the way through the trip. The tips and advice are even useful for accompanied travelers. ""Solo Travel"" makes you want to grab your passport and go. Don't read this if you can't take a vacation anytime soon."
1,this woman is a ditz,"I kept on reading just thinking there must be some bit of knowledge I can use in this book...nope....she's just as whiny as the Eat, Pray, Love chick."
5,Floor Runner,"these staples and the gun they are used in are the absolute best for installing Bruce ""Natural Reflections"" 5/16"" flooring. What a time saver over gluing this product!"
3,Check the Gauge on the staples for your gun,"these staples are 20 gauge. they will not fire in a gun that requires 19 gauge.19 Ga = 0.0418""20 Ga = 0.0359""the difference of 0.0059 does matter.The staples did arrive in good condition"
1,"received box broken open,Amazon did not reply to my e-mail,","Box received with 50% of staples broken, Amazon did not reply to our complaint, once they have payment, you are on your own!!!"
2,poor shipping,"I ordered staples the packaging was poor. The staples were out of there boxes.some were broke. this is not the first time this happened. The only reason iordered them again was the price waas unbeatable and i needed them fastB & C Eagle 97/25 1-Inch 20 Gauge 3/16-Inch Crown Staple for S3297-LHF (5,000 per Box)"
1,no packaging research,The little box of staples was inserted in a bigger box for shipping and after miles of travel the little opened scattering 5000 staples throughout the bigger box making them useless. The most frustrating was the attempt at contacting the shipping to get them resent. After wasting an hour I gave up.
3,Terrible shipping,"The box the staples were in was very flimsy and all the staples fell out. They were loose in the delivery box and all broken up. So many of them will not fit into the gun properly, therefore a waste. I cannot believe Amazon does not do an easy correction to this problem by just wrapping the box with some packaging tape."
1,NOT WORTH THE SAVINGS,"I bought three boxes of these staples thinking it would be a great savings.After spending half my time pulling out staples that crushed instead on going in the flooring I have decided they are not worth the savings.These China made staples are undersized to begin with and will not penetrate hard wood flooring like the stanley bostich staples. I will never make the mistake of buying cheap off brand staples again.I would advise anyone considering purchasing the staples to go back and buy the bostich.A. MartyB & C Eagle 97/25 1-Inch 20 Gauge 3/16-Inch Crown Staple for S3297-LHF (5,000 per Box)"
2,Still haven't learned,"Amazon has ignored all these reviews and still poorly package these staples. The staples are in a flimsy cardboard box that was thrown in a padded envelope. The box totally disintegrated and the staples broke apart. If you have time to mess with them, than this is a great deal."
2,Poor Packaging ... Old Stock ?,"Ordered these staples along with the Bostitch Stapler together. As happened with other reviewers the packaging was very poor. Shipped in the same box with the Bostitch stapler with only a 3 section ""air"" bag to fill in all the extra space. Half the staples were no longer full length. It also looked like this was a ""Returned"" item that was restocked and sold again cause part of the flap on the box was missing. On top of all this the staples were not coated as was stated and pictured. These were as shiny as can be ... no brown coating as pictured.No time to complain and return these so got the Bostitch staples at the Tool Rental store. Even Lowes and Homedepot didn't carry these.Go with the Bostitch staples as their box is HD and made the right way so as not to open on their own."
2,bad shipping,The product is a good value but the condition of the item upon reciept was very poor. The boxes were broke open and the staples were scattered throughout the too large of a shipping container which allowes the staples to shift about during shipment and makes using these very difficult causing jams in my staple gun which never jams when a full stick of staples are used. Dont order unless amazon finds a better soultion to package these items
5,after so many years...,"I used to love Ian and Sylvia when I was in high school. I had a few albums, but they got lost along the way. Someone mentioned them a few weeks ago, so I thought about their music again. This CD has all the songs I loved so much. It is wonderful to hear them again, even though I hear they are no longer together. I hope to buy a few more. They still have a very unique sound, and the lyrics are beautiful."
4,Pretty Nice Lens,"I do real estate photography and the 11 - 18 is essential for interior work. I've been using the lens for about 2 years now and like it pretty well. The major problem I have with it is color fringing along lines of high contrast. The lens also suffers from some minor fisheye distortion in the 11 - 13 range, but it is easily remedied in the digital darkroom. It has less distortion in the 14 - 18 range than my Nikkor 18 - 70 does at 18. It is not a good choice for people photography. I consider it a good value for the money."
1,Sister Lovers/CD Hater,"""Third/Sister Lovers"" by Big Star is, quite possibly, the worst cd I have ever heard. There is not one song worth listening to. I played the cd twice (figuring it couldn't be as bad as I suspected after the first listen) and it was worse the second time around. It sounds like something a bad high school band would have recorded in their basement. While I was a fan of Alex Chilton and the Box Tops, with the exception of the song September Gurls, Big Star seems to be a product of myth and the hype machine. Other than the aforementioned September Gurls, Big Star didn't have one song on their three albums that would have been an AM radio hit. It's no wonder that a major recording studio didn't pick them up. The band sounds as if they are stoned throughout the recording. It's disjointed, poorly mixed and the songs are horrible. George Martin himself couldn't have done anything with these tunes. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this dreck. What more can I say."
4,"Flawed yet beautiful, terrifying and moving","Third is best listened to, late at night, in a darkened room, in a contemplative mood. Others have said far more and more eloquently than I, but I will confine myself to stating that Big Black Car, Nighttime, Blue Moon and Take Care are some of the most beautifully fractured songs ever. Holocaust is sad beyond words, harrowing yet strangely moving. Approach with caution if you loved No. 1 Record and even Radio City, but if you give it the chance this is one of the most amazing records you'll ever hear."
5,The Ultimate Dark Night of the Soul Album,"There are bleak albums and then there is ""Third"". There is nothing quite so unhinged in the whole rock canon (there is not even an agreed track listing for the album), so swaying back and forth between manic lows and forced cheery highs as ""Third"".""Thank You Friends"" is probably the best Big Star song there is, tainted with a compelling dash of bitterness. ""Jesus Christ"" is the best Christmas song you'll never, ever hear on FM radio. And ""Holocaust"" is one of those rare songs that instantly bring down a weight of foreboding on any listener. And when Alex Chilton sings ""I'd rather shoot a woman than a man"" it's simply unblievable that he could consider anyone but himself.Quite simply, ""Third"" is the sound of depressives being forced to write happy songs -at gunpoint."
5,Bizarre Brilliance,"After establishing himself as a teen popper with The Box Tops, then moving on to proto power pop fame with Big Star's first two Beatle flavored albums, Alex Chilton made a bizarre and daring album called Third/Sister Lovers. This music is not for everyone,a lot of it is dark and quite depressing(""Holocaust"",""Kangaroo""-also later recorded by This Mortal Coil),yet well executed and a brilliant piece of art.A few moments recall Big Star's pop like ""Thank You Friends"" and ""Kizza Me"" yet somehow sound like they are from a darker realm. The bonus tracks from the sessions are cool also,some much in the vein of the loose later solo albums like Bach's Bottom and Flies On Sherbet. The version of The Kinks' ""Til The End Of The Day""(maybe better than the original ?) with an opening riff that sounds like the band is going to play The Who's ""Anyway,Anyhow, Anywhere"" is a cut I play often."
2,Depressing,"After listening to #1 Record/Radio City, this album is just depressing. That may be the intended or unintended point of Third, but that is not what attracts me to music. Some of the songs, such as Kizza Me and a few others, seem like a waste of space, and the best song on here, Till the End of the Day, is not even a Big Star song. Also, the inclusion of Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On is completely pointless. There are a few good moments, and the album would have been a lot better if the length had been cut in half. In general, Third has absolutely no direction and is a cult classic simply because it is the product of a crazy, albeit influential, guy in a band on the verge of collapse. By far Big Star's worst album."
4,An album way ahead of its time,"It takes listening to this album a few times to really appreciate it. It has the same haunting sadness of, well a Smiths or Radiohead album. This is definetly an album to listen to when you just want to dwell in your misery, yet there are a few surprise additions too. This is a must have for any true music lover."
3,Disappointing and Bizarre,"I have to agree with other reviewers who said that after listening to the first two Big Star albums, this one is somewhat bizarre and disappointing. It has its moments. But its very uneven, half hearted. Chilton was drugged up during the whole production and it shows . Kangaroo and Holocaust? Stoner music, pure and simple. Listen to it sober, the ""brilliance"" of those songs will disappear, trust me. Probably be a hit at an Emo party though. Just depressing. And its not that its not typcial Big Star pop. Its that its such a weak effort on Chilton's part. He sounds like he can barely stand at the mic to sing. I'm a big Big Star fan, but I have to agree with the one star reviewers on the #1/Radio City reviews that people can convince themselves anything is ""genius"" if they hear it enough. Remember kids, ""Just say no"". lol.I do like the sarcasm(?) of ""Thank you Friends"", and the best cover of the Kinks ""Till the end of the day"" I've ever heard. Blue Moon is a good tune also."
3,Uneven performances and bizarre moments on 3rd BS album,"Alex Chilton is an enigma. When Big Star's first album appeared, he and collaborator Chris Bell created a perfect marriage between soulful rock and power pop. By the time of the second album, Bell was gone and Chilton was fully in charge. Still, their second album had as many highlights as the first although it was a bit more ragged.Then came Third. Chilton's career can be summarized as follows; very talented musician who chucks it all to do very esoteric albums and erratic concert dates. Third demonstrates Chilton falling apart. In its raw, unfinished state, it's a fascintating record but certainly not his best. Really, this is an Alex Chilton solo album in all but name.Some of the music is quite powerful while some quite trival. They're mixed side by side. If anything this reminds me of the erratic Let It Be for than anything else."
5,Best Record Ever !,"Though it is a beet childish to decide a certain record is ""the best record ever made"" to one's opinion, in that case I have to be childish and say : ""That's actually the best album ever made..."" . Dark yet colorful beautiful songs which fill my eyes with excitement tears of totally mixed joy and sadness in each time I listen to it. If you're interested in more detailed review on the songs take a look at Chris K's review. I tend to agree with most of what's written there. If you are a true music lover (one that listens to music and not just uses it as a 'background'), do not hesitate - get it immediately."
3,Death in national parks,"This book is OK.It is a compilation of old newspaper accounts of tragedies in national parks. Unlike the ""Grand Canyon"" and ""Yosemite"" books this does not go into any type of detail about the accidents. It also does not categorize the events, rather it does them in a chronological order."
2,Over My Head,"I sat down to watch the first episode of this DVD with high expectations, knowing something of the host and one of the guests.But as I watched I found myself annoyed at the theological language and posturing that was happening. I continually felt like a good point was coming, only to watch as they steered clear of open and honest answers to stay safely in the zone of human wisdom.What I wanted was real dialogue between three people in hopes to spur along the conversation in my own life.What I found was another example of impressive resumes winning out over personal content.I recommend the Nooma series instead."
1,No acid with the battery,"I ordered this online on Sunday and got an email on Monday that the seller wanted to be sure I was aware they do not ship the battery with the acid ""charge"" pak, and asked me to confirm I was ok with that....HELLO!! Why would I buy a battery w/o acid? Read the small print on this. I have contacted them this morning to see if I can cancel the order. I will update later today or whenever they answer..."
5,Que joya,"Todavía estoy sorprendido con este disco. No ha parado de sonar en mi auto, en mi computadora....Indudablemente este disco es una joyita escondida que al encontrarla te das cuenta que todavía hay grupos que valen la pena."
2,Overrated by other reviewers,"I bought this CD based on the reviews and because I really like Firewater and Gogol Bordello -- 2 other bands with a strong eastern European influence. Unfortunately, DeVotchKa is simply not in the same category as these other phenomenal bands. With a few notable exceptions, most of the songs are derivative and lack energy, and frequently consist of too much repetition of simple melodies without adding good counterpoint. If you want something like this that will knock your socks off, get Firewater ""Get Off the Cross ... We Need the Wood For the Fire"" or Gogol Bordello ""Gypsy Punks Underdog World Strike"". DeVotchka is an OK band, but certainly not worthy of the endless 5-star reviews it got for this album. I strongly suspect a lot of the 5 star reviews are from band members or friends of the band. Buyer beware!"
5,devotchka's best,Great group of their most popular and followed songs! Their music draws you in and grabs you. Enjoy the album.
5,Highly recommended...,I purchased this CD when it was first released three and a half years ago and am still listening to it on a regular basis.The vocals remind me of Roy Orbison (one of my favorite classics) and the instrumentation and production are lush and very atmospheric.
2,We have come a long way.,"As someone who works with adolescents that sexually offend, I was appalled by Lakey's characterization of this population. Her book does little to actually educate its reader. Lakey is clearly someone who is afraid of children with these issues and she wants everyone else to be afraid of them too. Fortunately for everyone, research tells us that everything that ""experts"" like Lakey thought they knew about this population was wrong. But she wouldn't know that because although this book was published in 2004, Lakey relies on research produced before 1997.Graduate students are discouraged from using research findings more than five years old - there is a reason for that."
4,If they're into Ben 10....,"you can't go wrong. This toy is 12"" and my boys like playing with it. I thought they would like the 12"" toys better because they're bigger, but they really enjoy the metamorfigures better because they turn into other things."
2,I returned it to Home Depot,In using the tool over a two day period I found it worked well on dry wall.It was not do all cutter that the salesman told me about.I broke three bits - high strg carbon cutters - in twenty minutes working with a countertop trim job. I returned to using my ten year old Porter Cable Lam Cutter with the same bit I have used for two months - everyday.Save your money - buy Porter Cable.
2,Disappointed,"I have found that the Roto Zip battery opperated, in not worth the money. I have use mine a few times on drywall and it gets very sluggish very quickly. The batteries last a very short time. I was using it on a small job and the thing just stopped. It made horrible grinding sounds and chugged then stopped. I have email the company but haven't heard from them yet. I don't think it was worth the [money] I paid for it. Buy another tool!!!!!"
4,Customer Care,"I have this tool which I use everyday (1 yr.)in the line of work I perform as a electrician. I work building new homes doing the final finishes (lighting and switches etc..). I used the tool everyday cutting out vinyl siding and some sheet rock work. The tool has gotten dirty and is need of some maintenance so I will be sending my tool back to ROTOZIP for this. If they take care of this then I will give it a ""5"". I will write back!! Remember this tool is only battery operated 12v DC not 120v AC!!!Warren"
4,Not sure why it is so hard to find.,"It took me a long time to find this item. But I have been very satisfied with it. I can't imagine using a tool like this with a power cord. The cordless option is outstanding. Especially for drywall wall and ceiling work. I've also used it for some very tricky trim work, trick or odd flooring cuts, and even the occassional finished carpentry. Having the right bits is everyting. So get yourself some extra bits of various kinds to have in the toolbox for when you need them. My only criticism is that the height guide is easily bent, and just not made to the same quality as the tool. It can eat batteries, so keep them charged or buy extras."
1,AP Ace,"Best review? More like the worst. Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. The books practice tests (well REA's practice tests in general) are terrible. I think the last time anyone from the REA took a real AP or SAT test was back in the 1970s or something. The review section is helpful just in terms of basic grammar, but this book is not an effecient way to study."
5,Brings History to Life,"This journal describes the building of the Union Pacific Railroad in a realistic manner that truly brings history to life. With the dramatic landscape of the West as the backdrop, we see the struggles between the whites and the Native Americans, the Irish and the Chinese, and the main character Sean and his own self-doubts. This is a classic, well-told tale."
3,Ok for Boys,"It is a good book for more boys. It can keep you interested in it. There was alot of flashback in the story. He keeps remembering when he had all the different jobs on the railroad, and keeps thinking how lucky he is where he is.My favorite part in this book is when the indians shot at them. It made every body jump."
4,Bringing back good memories,"I haven't heard Brother Dave in years but have thought of his comedy routines many times and laughed to myself over ""The Motorcycle Story"" or ""The Haunted House"". I told them to my friends and now I can play them for them and share the laughter. Thank you for bringing back such good memories. Brother Dave was one of the great southern comedians who has been over looked over the years and it's good to have this CD to share that with others who have never heard of him.""Here Julius hold this. Et tu Brutay? No man, I ain't et nothing""...."
2,Great Reproduction,"This CD is a great reproduction of exactly the same albums my parents listened to in the 1950's. It brought back all the ""weird"" sayings we got from Dave Gardner, who was ahead of his time."
5,Dave was a man whos jokes will live on when we're memories.,I remember Dave Gardner from when I was child and I was supprised when I pulled out the old vinal at how current his jokes still are. He and Bill Cosby have a commonality in that they both like to tell good entertaining stories that are filled with thought provoking yet humorous ideas and concepts at the same time. He keeps you in stitches every moment you are listening to him.
3,Rejoice dear hearts / Kick thy own self,"I was a fan of ""Brother Dave"", back when he was plying the clubs. I owned most, if not all of his ""ROCA Alblims"" that over time disappeared. I was happy to get these CD's and have enjoyed them greatly. I look forward to getting others that are available. His humor, imagination, sense of reality and use of our language is not equaled by today's crop of comedians."
5,Now That's Humor!,Takes me back to early childhood listening to Brother Dave on an LP my Dad used to play. CD was in excellent condition and I've enjoyed sharing this CLEAN humor with my kids.
5,Thank goodness these are on CD!,"Many years ago my family dearly loved playing the Dave Gardner LP records. Now the next generation is able hear him on CD.Unfortunately, not all of Gardner's albums have been produced in CD format. That leaves me with the task of converting the LPs I have on hand and using software to edit out the scratches. That can be a very long and arduous process. So, lets have all of his albums made available on CD!"
5,"The Best of all Southner comedians. No Hard sayins""","We live in a time when its still hard to find individual talent.James Dickey said the key to SOUTHERN humor was that it was self=deprecating. All of Dave Gardners characters lived and are still living in these United States.Still, nothing like Brother Dave."
5,The Father of Modern Comedy - A MUST HEAR!!!,"Brother Dave as he was and is known to a loyal group of fans influenced the development of recorded comedy as much as Muddy Waters and Jimmie Rogers influenced music. In the rabid days of McCarthyism, the beginning of the Cold War, and the Civil Rights Movement; Brother Dave brought out the dark sides of life through humor, forcing those who listened to think about and question their beliefs. I am of the George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Cheech and Chong age, but Brother Dave broke the ground in the clubs and the studio's to give rise to a brand of comedy adapted to different audiences, in different regions, of different races. Know Thy 50's and 60's mind set and history, then Rejoice Dearheart in the throes of laughter!"
3,"The Dark Island, The Black Watch","I have been looking for music by The Black Watch for some time, having great memories of a long lost vinyl rendition from the early sixties entitled ""Highland Pageantry, The Pipes and Drums of the Black Watch"". I believe it was on RCA Stereo or possibly Columbia Masterworks. This current version is as stirring in many ways as the old, and I liked the updated rythms in the drum section. However, there is a contemporary influence that seems to be trying to appeal to a wider audience by including some songs that don't seem to belong to ""The Ladies from Hell"". I am left seeking the original vinyl recording. Does anyone out there know where I could obtain a copy?"
2,The best of the three so far,"I found this DVD of the set to be the best so far.Lauren Winner makes one great statement that this whole section could have been based on...""Adoring God is an end."" Meaning that there is nothing more to gain from the practice. We are here to adore God. (period)I liked how she brought up this point, but then seemed to almost contradict herself by going on to talk about the importance of spiritual disciplines and how Christians have forgotten them.In my history with the church I can not often recall a friend who didnt wish that they read their bible or prayed more. Or who didnt make statements that alluded to how brief their quiet times are and how much they wanted to change that.I think for me it would have been refreshing to watch a conversation between two people discussing the importance of adoring God as an end and not a means."
3,Not for all brands of wood.,"I purchased the adaptor for my 401 nailer to use on 1/2"" solid flooring. I had used the nailer for 2 other floors that were 3/4"" solid hardwood and had experienced little or no problems. The results here were quite different. I immediately started damaging the finished edge above the tongue because the nailer was bottoming out along this edge at least 1/32"" before the nailer contacted the tongue. It was crushing the edge of the wood when the impact of the shoe was brought to force against the wood. I needed to use this nailer so I fabricated a brass spacer to take up the space which allowed the plate to strike the tongue first and thus eliminated the problem. It appears that all wood manufactures do not mill there wood to any type of standard and therefore, on size 3/8""-9/16"" nailer does not work with all woods. That problem solved, I am now experiencing numerous bent over nails which also destroys the wood. Haven't figured that one out yet, but it isn't the shoe."
5,MJH's Classic Live Performance,"Mississippi John Hurt here performs largely his own original compositions, but also some spirituals and some standards--at the peak of his form. Here hs is the master of technically demanding finger-picking, and here his voice is mellow and mature--absolutely great. This is a five-star concert recording, not only for its wonderful and extraordinary content but also for quality of sound. I feel privileged to own a copy of this cd, and listen to it nightly--it simply doesn't get old: it has that much character. Buy this cd."
5,"Great album, but...","It's a live album recorded at Oberlin College in 1965 in front of an audience and not what most people think of as a ""Best of"". Someone mentioned this below, but I thought it was worth pointing out again. The audience is very, very quiet (except when they are overly amused by a few subtle lyrical slip ups - if they didn't laugh you really wouldn't notice too much in my opinion... sorta annoying)."
5,The best of MJH,"Having seen some guitar Tabs of his songs I came across this album and brought it out of curiosity, ( I like the old blues musicians) Brilliant! Recorded infront of a live audience MJH entertains through the whole album. At times I became frustrated wanting to know what the audience were laughing at. If you want to hear a great blues guitarist then buy this one. I listen to the cd now and again, but not just the once, it always goes on 'Repeat'. Now I can't find enough of his material."
3,Gift for a friend,"This was a gift for a friend who likes Su Doku, she seems to really enjoy it. I don't think it's something she would have bought for herself, but she does seem to like the way that the game is set up."
5,A hidden classic,"This album, their third, shows the band using a more sophisticated approach to songwriting than their earlier efforts. Still, the songs are short, intense little drops of wonder, with a sweet innocence to the lyrics that make you wish life were this simple. Feargall's voice is as wonderfully wacked-out as ever(what a funky gene pool to produce his trill), and the O'Neill brothers' songwriting is top notch power pop with a Northern Irish soul."
3,experimentation=free rein to bad ideas,"Positive Touch is as catchy as you would expect from The Undertones, based on their first two albums, but prepare to cringe at some of the gimmicks on this disc. Some are merely silly without spoiling whole songs, such as the dopey ""AAAAH-AH"" backing vocals that begin ""Fascination."" The same goes for the gratuitous reverb on ""Julie Ocean,"" and all the horns. But others are just embarrasingly stupid--the pan-pipes on ""Hannah Doot,"" the Spanish guitar on ""I Don't Know,"" and pretty much all of the title track. Xylophone, slide guitar, latin beat, a title that sounds like the name of a straight-edge band... this song's a train-wreck.That said, the album will grow on you. It is a tribute to the songwriting powers of the Undertones that I find myself singing along with every ridiculous song."
1,NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME: TABLE OF CONTENTS IS NOT WORKING!,"I don't have a problem with the content of this book. However, the Kindle edition is not ready to be sold, as you can not access the table of contents. The only way to navigate the book is to literally click the ""NEXT PAGE"" button page by page,until you reach the content you have interest in reading. You can look forward to you buttons to fail. Too bad, the material seemed very interesting. I plan to purchase the hard copy."
1,"Oh no, not more","Will various banal interpersonal conflicts of a personal nature all turn out for the best in idyllic fantasyland Cape Light? Just as surely as Thomas Kinkade will get millions more dollars selling holiday pennants, air fresheners, Christmas choo-choo trains, and overpriced prints of his egregiously sappy artwork!In this volume, the good people of the village of cozy cottages, old-tyme independent businesses, and upright churchgoers face yet another harrowing dilema! Should they be evil hypocritical secular humanist snobs and turn away a new center for troubled teens? Or should they do the right thing and trust in providence and be welcoming?What do you think? Do you really need to shell out bucks and read this schmaltzy little screed to find out? Thomas Kinkade is reportedly worth $75 million. Why further enrich him?"
4,"A HOMEY, SMALL TOWN STORY","Cape Light is the kind of place where you'd like to spend some time getting to know its inhabitants and enjoy the scenery. It's a town where people hold secrets and pain in their hearts as well as their secret longings. But it's also about people trying to get through the everyday struggles of living and working together. Of course there are those who rub you wrong, as the case is with Charlie, who is not only running against Emily for Mayor, but is doing so in an underhanded manner. And then there is her mother, Lilian, who is against Emily's sister Jessica, who plans to marry Ben. Lillian thinks that Ben isn't good enough for her daughter. They are characters you might judge at first glance, but come to realize the pain and guilt that compels them to act as they do. Much like real people react to mistakes they've made. This story holds secrets to the way we can respond in a possitive or negative way to our wrong choices and how they affect others. This is a good read!"
5,another geat Cape Light book,Am reading and keeping all of these Thomas Kinkade/Katherine Spencer Cape Light novels. Throughly enjoyble and always want to read more and keep caught up and look forward to meeting new people.

1,Traumatic,"One reviewer went as far as to say that the spanking is ""healthy"" in a relationship.Excuse me? Pain is ""healthy"" for two people who had a horrific past? Um, no.This was a terrible story with an awfully sadistic point of view. Some people really don't understand how bad bringing that particular thing into play in the bed. For passionate- yet tender-hearted readers, which is what we all are since we're reading Harlequin and not authors like Rachel Kramer Bussel, it's not fun. It's not sexy. It's not ""healthy.""The spanking ruined an entire book. It's extremely unrealistic for people who had traumatic pasts to like this. And I hate that there are some authors who really don't understand that. I've read many books where this has happened, and I wonder, why do these writers think that someone who was abused, or came from a tragic and hurtful past, would actually like a spanking? That's what caused the pain and trauma in the first place!Skip this book. It's just ridiculous, and absolutely unreal."
4,Meatloaf,"Not long enough, of course. For what it was, and how much I paid, not bad.More concert footage would have been nice, instead of just little bits here and there."
3,meatloaf in search of paradise,"nicely done, just not what i expected.would like a more in depth look at the early years."
5,Very helpful for my paper,I was glad that amazon had this available. I used it for my biomedical ethics class. It is an important topic.
3,Inspiration,I find this book to be something for inspiration. It does not go in to details so for a beginer it is OK.I was looking for lot more.Waste of money.
5,El Retorno del Rey,"The book came promptly and was in great condition. I was totally happy with my purchase and thought that, if anything, the product could have been rated as ""like new"" condition instead of ""good."" Not much of a complaint!"
5,The Definitive Guide to Istanbul,"As someone who has guided tourists through Istanbul, this is the best book available to provide site seeing advice and a true flavor of the history of this magnificent city. No book prior or since has painted a more comprehensive description of Istanbul."
5,Works well!,"I actually bought this to scrape off the adhesive and backing from the glued down astroturf the previous owners of our home so wonderfully decided to put down like 20 years ago. It works well, and it took some abuse from me. I managed to remove the backing from our 360sqft 3 seasons room in about 2 hours, and I'm a woman. If my husband had done it, he probably would have been even faster! If I had done it with a hand scrapper, it would have taken FOREVER and it woulda been pretty painful. I HIGHLY recommend if you need to remove some flooring! It is very well made, and definitely worth the $25."
5,Very Nice...,"My husband is a captain, so what better gift for a captain??? Right??? I gave them to him for Christmas, and he loved them. The detail of the ships was impressive too. Very Nice!"
5,Great Album,We heard this band on PBS and just loved it so we ordered all of their albums. Very danceable.
5,Travel to an exotic place without leaving home,"This album transcends any currently playing mainstream radio. Amazingly good and although I'm unfamiliar with Khymer, I want to sing along or at the very least swing my hips to the music.Definitly different, but also definitely great."
1,Tales from the Crypt,I chose these tapes because my husband and I use to watch them on TV years ago and enjoyed them. When I found the series on line I got excited. However when we got them we didn't know they were unsensored. The fowl language and the nudity was very unneccesary. We didn't have any of that when we watched it on TV. So I thought that was what I was getting.I feel there can be movies made without all the garbage and still be enjoyable.I would not recommend this item.
2,Not My Cup-o-tea,"I forgot these were originally on HBO.I have only seen these on Sci-Fi edited. I must have only caughtthe tamer episodes. I mean Blyth Danner, Adam Ant, Salome Jens andeven Clarence Williams III (Linc on ""The Mod Squad"")are great in ""Maniac At Large"" with their adventures in the library.""Lover Come Hack To Me"" is actually funny and fun to look at;cool, old rainy house; As long as the ""Old Battle Ax"" doesn't bother you too much;You know what I mean?I thought there would be more like that.I give it a high grade for production and performance of dvd'sbut I can only take about 5% of the content, and that's generous.(I did buy three single seasons, later when I realized I may have missedsome I would like, because I gave away my complete series, anddid find a few more I could like.)"
4,"fun, enthralling story that made me finish it in a day!","After reading reviews about 'happy story' and 'uplifting characters' I was a little weary of what I might be in-store for when I started this book.It is a fun, light but touching story about a woman who finds herself - mostly thanks to the Institute of Affirmation. I finished this book in less than 24 hours - I couldn't put it down.Whether you are trying to find yourself or just want to enjoy a book without having to worry about figures in history or geographical data - this is a great book for you... highly recommend."
3,A light and frothy novel.,"I enjoyed the novel for what it was: an interesting but insubstantial read. Its not one of those ""stick your ribs"" books: I finished the novel yesterday and it is already fading from memory. We get to know Jenny Brown quite well, but her husband and the other supporting characters are not as fully developed. Also, the ending struck me as a little too perfect. Still, for a quick and unchallenging diversion, I would recommend it."
4,An inspiring novel!,I first stumbled upon one of Sara Lewis' novels (But I Love You Anyway) at an airport newstand and have been a fan ever since. I finished The Answer is Yes in two days and was completely absorbed from start to finish. It is filled with wonderful characters that the reader truly comes to care about and is strongly reminiscent of Anne Tyler's work. And if only there really were an Institute of Affirmation!
5,DO YOU WANT TO BE HAPPY? READ THIS BOOK.,"I just finished re-reading this book and I loved it even more now than I did the first or second time I read it (I'd first read it years ago.)It's like the author is your own personal cheerleader and you in turn will be the main character Jenny's cheerleader! The book will make you happy.Reading this book gets your positive, creative juices flowing and you start thinking about your own life and wanting to make plans again. You also start keeping an open mind and an open eye for the possibilities God may be sending your way. It's energizing, a verbal dose of vitamin B12.If the Institute of Affirmation had classes in every city across America would the classes be filled? ""The Answer Is Yes""Read this book and tell your friends about it too."
2,I tried,"I really tried to like this book. Ultimately, though I found the plot to drag and the characters to be very cliche. It was a very slow read and although I finished it, I found it to be more of a chore than an enjoyable read."
2,Sappy,"This wasn't the worst book I have ever read, but it was far from being one of the best. It tried so hard to be so syrupy sweet and good and wholesome, but I just didn't buy into it. I felt absolutely no sympathy for the main character, Jenny, who seemed to stumble through life with no direction just accepting what ever was dished out to her. That her life could miraculously change by attending some classes at a school of affirmations was to me just a little too crackpot to fall for. That it all came to an end in a neat happy little bundle with very little struggle or sacrifice makes this a quick read that you really do not even need to concentrate on. The whole ""let's put on a play"" theme reminded me of too many sappy Andy Hardy and Judy Garland movies. I am not a grumpy, cynical person. Rather, I am pretty much happy go lucky all the time but this was too much even for me to take."
1,Fake product,"I used before product from Ulta, it made my hair so smooth and shiny, this time I ordered it online, on amazon, it doesn't make any difference, it leaves my hair frizzy and dry. I suspect it is a fake product, although the bottle has the same UPC code as the one from Ulta and the colour of the cream is the same...do not buy it on amazon."
1,Disappointed with seller,"I've always been a fan of this hair mask but unfortunately I had to give it 1 star since the jar I got in the mail is either fake or defective. The stuff made my hair really really dry and tangled. I noticed right away because everytime after I put this hair mask on, I always touched my ends and they felt really soft and smooth; this time however they dont. I am returning this jar and probably wont never buy it from Amazon! BEWARE"
1,useless,"If I could give it zero stars I would. It did nothing for my dry, frizzy hair. I kept it on for 30 mins as suggested by some of the reviews. Totally waste of money. My search for a hair repair mask continues.Disappointing."
2,Got shipped in USED CONDITiON,"I received this item in a box, appropriately packaged and all but when I took it out to open and use, there was liquid/product all over the sides of the lid. It was clear someone had used it or it had been opened, spilled and then the lid was put back again. It was smeared all over the sides. It was really disgusting and I decided to not use it in case of any bacteria/safety issues."
3,Smells good..works alright,If you are looking for a miracle product I dont think this is it. I love the smell and the consistency. But I didn't find any more benefits after using this product then I did using Aussie 3 min miracle deep conditioner. So the choice is yours but its just alright.
3,I expected better...,"I thought that this product would make my hair really soft, but after the first, then second, then third time I used it, it didn't really make a significant difference in the texture of my hair. It's not something I'm recommending, because for the price, I expected better.I have straight black hair, slightly damaged (slightly coarse, some split-ends), mid-length, and despite the fact that my hair is not so damaged it didn't do much to enhance the shine or texture of it.One pro is that it smells good, but the smell does come off a bit strong, which might bother some people, but I like it."
3,Can't keep smelling it but...,"I heard tonnes of hype about this masque and bought it off amazon and had it shipped to all the way to Singapore just to try it out. The smell is AMAZING and I couldn't keep my nose off it when I first got it. I have fine, straight, slightly color damaged and frizzy hair. Tried it out for the first time and I left it on for 20 minutes. It felt so smooth after I rinsed it out but after my hair air-dried, my hair was still frizzy. Tried it out the second time together with the healing oil and I left it on overnight which was a bad idea cause it got my scalp really really itchy and the results was still the same. A little disappointed with the product but it did work on my friend who has thicker and very dry hair so I guess it all depends on your hair type! Shall keep trying to get better results!Pros: Love the scent that lingers in my hairCons: Made my scalp really itchy, frizz was only slightly tamed."
2,Not that awesome...,"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about this product. I have highlighted curly hair that is very very dry and damaged. I left this on for 10 minutes, when the recommended is 7, and still it didn't do anything. The only thing about it that I really like is the smell, and I would much rather have a product work, than smell good. Overall, way to pricey for some good smelling conditioner."
1,"Not for dry, curly hair","I was very frustrated with my unruly curly hair and I was excited to get this product. Tried it several times and, with each treatment, my hair got worse! The scent is fantastic, though...I will miss that!"
1,did absolutely nothing,"i have really dry hair which is why i wanted to try this product. there is nothing i like about this product. i followed the instructions, but it did nothing for my hair. i hated how it felt in my hair, and it definitely did not norish and moisturize my hair. i actually used it till it got finished cuz i figured my hair would have to get used to it. i was very disappointed but oh well, you win some, you lose some."
5,Best Smell - Great Product,Results showed FOR ME after about two uses (every 2 weeks). Great Smell and leaves your hair feeling soft.I want to try more of this line's products in the future.
1,Waste of money.,"I have dry curly ethnic hair. This product made herbal essences look good. It made my already dry hair very dull and extremely dry. It gave me breakage and I was very disappointed since the product has such good reviews.If you have curly ethnic (black white mixed) hair, I suggest you avoid this product."
5,it does its job,"this makes a difference in your hair right after the first use. After using it for a couple of months, my hair has been softer than ever and super shiny too!"
1,awful,This product didn't work well with my hair at all. I'm so disappointed at the result and I think its a fake one. It's a waste of money and I don't recommend it at all!!
3,THE SCENT IS WAYYYYY TOO STRONG :((((((,"This works really well. It is not time-consuming, it's easy, and it works sooo great. It leaves your hair really soft and silky and hydrated than it ever would be. It is a little pricey, but on Amazon it is way cheaper than in Target, and the product seems to be authentic.ONE THING. It smell so, so strong. Looking at the outside of this product, it seems so natural and mild. But the scent it so strong i can smell it even when the jar is closed... Now, I am a very sensitive girl when it comes to scents, but the smell is strong even for someone not as sensitive as I am.It smells like a lot of chemicals.. not natural at all, not fresh, and it's kind of weird. Totally unpleasant. It smells like it tried TOO hard to smell good and then failed.I'm so glad i bought 8.5 oz instead of 16 oz, because that would have been a lot of money wasted.I wanted to love this so much, but turns out that I don't."
2,Not that much of a difference,"Ok I didn't buy this expecting a miracle, but it hasn't done much to improve my hair. I purchased solely on the reviews. I've been using it for almost 3 weeks, have not notice any significant improvement. My hair does feel a little bit less dry but I am not getting what I was expected. I think the price is too much for the quantity."
3,It's just OKAY,I had read a few of the reveiws on this product and thought that I would give it a try and it was just okay. there is still better products out there that are better priced as well
1,Caused hair to fall out on very first application,"I bought this product because of the raving reviews and after trying it for the first time yesterday, am a little shocked. I followed the directions word for word and when I started washing out my hair, a huge clump of my hair just fell off...no exaggeration there. It continued falling out till I stepped out of the shower. My hair doesn't feel any different than it would if I used a conditioner and it actually seems very flat today. Nevertheless to say, I will not be using this product anymore and it is going in the trash."
1,"Liked ONLY the smell, nothing else",I read all the great reviews for this product and purchased it a couple of weeks ago.I have a wavy black hair that reaches my shoulder. I hoped that this product would hydrate my hair and provide moisture for my dull looking hair.It did NOTHING !! The only think that i liked was the scent of the conditioner. Just a fancy looking product. Disappointed.
2,Fake!!,Did not give me any results at all like the one I get at Ulta!!! The texture is not the same either!! Will spend a little extra to get it at Ulta next time!
5,Love this product,"My hair has never felt so soft before. After using so many conditioners that promises soft, healthy hair, this product actually delivers. Just one usage and I saw a difference and my hair has substantially grown. Worth every penny!! Definitely placing another order once the one I have is finish."
3,"Like it, but pricey!","I really liked the smell of this product, and i think it's a decent for a deep repair mask.BUT, im not crazy bout the price. I checked around, and most of the stores sell this for about $30,which is actually wayy too much for what you're getting. This is a good hair mask, but I believe thatthe Pantene beautiful lengths replenishing mask is just as good. And that costs about...$4-7? So yeah,if you're worried bout money, i'd pass..."
3,It's okay...,"First off, this is not a negative review. Maybe I just expected too much, but I really didn't get what all the hype was about. It was a good conditioner, but not worth the price tag. I even tried putting it on one side of my head, and Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose on the other. The results, outside of the smell, were the same. Once again, it was a good conditioner, I just expected more. I probably won't repurchase."
1,fake fake fake,False PRODUCT PLZ DO Not BUY.. Very unhappy the Hair Mask is suppose too be a Very thick paste not creamy
5,Smells good!,"I bought this product for my fiancé, and it has helped make her hair softer,now I did see some complains of smell... I don't understand why. The product smells delicious and I would definitely recommendf it to others. Overall I am really satisfied and would definitely buy again!"
2,NOT for people with thick hair,"Seller was grreat and should get FIVE STARS. However, the product itself is designed to fluff up hair. For someone like me -- who already has thick hair, it gives toooooooo much body and makes the texture very rough."
4,Works wonders!,"I have used this product for about 3-4 months(NOT A WEEK OR TWO) At first I was skeptical because I've used a lot of products that say are for ""deep repair"" or ""deep conditioning"" and once I have taken the product off my hair is dry as broom!I have curly hair and I use a lot of hot tools on my hair (flat iron/hot rolls/blow dryer)So it is easily to get dry and dull hair...The way I found this product to work on my hair is by using this product and adding a little bit of the Macadamia Healing Oil Treatment... leave it in for 30 minutes w a hair cap and I promise you, your hair will feel better, look better and will have shine!Trust me when I say that if you use a pump of the Macadamia Healing Oil Treatment along with this mask it works!!"
4,botox for hair!,"I use this mainly as a hair conditioner because my hair has become so damaged after I coloured it a few times. LOVE THE SMELL. It has a nice warm and nutty flavor that stays in my hair for a while. Don't use too much otherwise you will get greasy hair, this is what I did the first time. I learnt that if you use a small handful, you will get nice, manageable and soft hair. So glad I found it."
3,It's a Good Deep Conditioner but Not Great,This is a good deep conditioner and it smells nice but it's nothing special. I can buy a deep conditioner at the supermarket and it will work just as well. This isn't worth the money when you can go and buy a cheaper one that does the same (or better) job.
1,FAKE!,"I have ordered before from different amazon sellers and got the real deal, but this time I didn't get so lucky. This is fake! I didn't return it only because I am still using it. I have three little boys (2 are babies and one in lots of sports) and no time to drive 20 mins to my salon and buy the real thing from my stylist. It is still conditioner and smells similar but completly different (cheap) texture. To bad amazon is turing in to a risky place to get deals!"
1,this is fake.,"as soon as i opened the container i knew it was fake, i can't believe i just wasted my money on this thing.do not buy this product."
2,At first highly dissapointing,"After all the reviews, I purchased the large jar and was expecting great results. That is far from the truth. At first my hair was very dry after using this product and that was very disappointing. After that I started using it in large quantities per treatment (just to get rid of it) and it started working quite well. To this day I am not sure if it just takes a bunch of applications before the results are evident or just need to use large quantities at a time. Either way I highly doubt I will ever purchase this product again. There are so many more to try and this is not a keeper so far for me."
3,umm,"i was so so so excited to purchase this given its about 50% off on amazon compared to the original price..ive used it twice and it does make my hair softer for sure but im reading all this stuff about how the one sold here on amazon is a fake one. if so ill be VERY disappointed & would LOVE my money back so i can go purchase a real product. hasn't done anything wrrrong to my hair but its not an incredibly different result. so far i do like it, it smells WONDERFUL! if this is the real product i love it 100% but if its not shame on amazon! its a white/light pink color and ive heard the real macadamia masque are pure white. let me know if you are concerned for the same reason. i will not repurchase from here though, i will buy from an Ulta next time. dont know if i trust this.."
1,It left my hair like straw,"I have used this product 2 times. The first time I wanted to cry because I have damaged hair but after using this product my hair looked worse! I followed the instruction precisely so this didn't happen because I left it on my hair too long or washed off too early. The second time, well, I have the belief that we should always give a second chance and the result was the same.I dislike this product so much, the worst I have ever used! Fortunately, I was able to find a good shampoo that repaired my hair and it's organic (Aubrey organic shampoos) I didn't even have the need to use a conditioner. Although, I was able to find a solution for my damaged hair, I wasted my money on this expensive, useless product...I wanted to give it to my mom because it would probably work on her hair but no, I'm not going to run the risk of ruining my mom's beautiful black hair so this jar is going where it belongs...to the garbage."
4,softens and detangles,This mask is worth it for sure. I have long wavy fine colored hair and this mask works very well for me.I use it once a week and it really softens my hair and detangles it. It is very light and smells really nice.I did find a better mask though and stopped using this one.
2,Overrated product,"I bought this product a month ago and I`ve been using it as indicated, however, I haven`t seen much difference in my hair. This product smells great but it's sadly to say that my hair doesn't look more neither hydrated nor shiner. I usually make my purchase decision based on others' reviews; unfortunately, this time seems like I wasted $20.00 because I didn't get the results I was expecting."
2,No difference . . . .nice smell,"Been using this product for a number of months, but i don't think i have been able to see a difference. yes your hair does get a bit softer than usual, as well as a nice fragance stays with your hair all day long. BUT there is no nice shine to it, nor have I noticed my hair healthier or anything.Then again it may work great for some people and it may not work at all for others."
5,LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!,"I have used this product only 2 times. And I saw results the first time I used it. I have coarse thick hair, and I go to the salon every week to get my hair blown out because its so frizzy and thick. This weekend I decided to blow out my hair myself, and it came out the same way, as when I get my hair done in the salon. Its shiny, soft, and flexible. I'm going to try the shampoo and see if I get better results.This works with any type of her. I love this product and I highly recommend it!!"
1,i brought it for the review,Product left my hair dry and brittle feeling and not easy to comb through....I could have use a drug store brand for a better result.
4,Great product,"This product is good, it smells fantastic. I left it on longer than the suggested time around 45 minutes. My hair was soft and shiny after I dried it!"
5,VERY NOURISHING,"I love the macadamia oil deep repair mask. It smells incredible and the scent lasts about 2 days, depending on what shampoo you used. Also I left it on for about 20 minutes (during my workout) and then rinsed it out, to have soft shiny hair! Love this and would buy it again."
2,"Yeah, this is fake.","I was so excited to see this product nearly 50% off on Amazon! So great! However, upon arrival it was A- Open and all over the inside of the box, and B- Very obviously fake. The real product has a stronger/sweeter smell, is a pure white color, and is creamier in consistency. I have used this obvious replica a few times and the results are mediocre, like a regular conditioner... but they are nothing in comparison to the real thing. Save yourself some cash--- Go to Ulta, or even CVS and buy it for the extra cash. You'll be glad you did."
4,Increases hair volume,"This helps increase my hair volume more than anything else I've tried for my fine, thin hair; it's also reasonably priced, especially when you get the large liter size."
2,Didn't work for super straight highlighted blonde hair,"So I have extremely dry hair due to coloring and using bleach to highlight my hair. The first day I used it, it left my hair extremely dry and stringy and not to mention how brassy my hair color looked! I had used it in the shower and left in on for about 10 mins and completely rinsed it out. So the next time I used the conditioner I left it on for about 30-40 mins and rinsed it out but left a little bit in. It did leave my hair extremely soft that time but my hair color still looked really brassy and made my blonde highlights look Bleh :-( Was not really satisfied. One more thing,since I didnt rinse it out completely it left my super straight lifeless, thin hair even more lifeless. I guess this product may be good for brunettes with thick hair (no way did it work for my straight blonde hair)."
2,nervous because of news of fakes,"I've bought this before at an Ulta and was excited that it was cheaper here. although the product smells correct and has a similar texture, it doesn't quite seem to be the color I remember. when I opened the package it seemed like perhaps the product had been opened, as the lid had product in the grooves despite the inside ""seal"" that comes with the product. I will betaking this home with me this weekend to compare it to the real thing-- until then it WILL NOT touch my hair.I simply don't trust it yet. I'll try to figure out how to update this review when I compare the two."
5,Believe the Hype!,"After a hair bleaching fiasco, my hair was DRY, DRY,DRY. It felt like a brillo pad. My sister-in-law told I would need some intensive hair conditioning to get it back near normal.I had wanted to use this Deep Conditioner before I destroyed my hair. SO i decided to buy this and give it a try. After ONE application my dry, brillo bleached hair, it was shiny, soft and smelled great. My hair looked better than it did ever before. I do this once a week and my hair looks great, the color has been preserved, and I am never trying anything else. Ever."
4,great product,"i've noticed my hair to have more volume than usual. there's still a frizz here n there but maybe because i just let my hair air dry. after my first wash i noticed right away that my hair is not that brittle as before! i dont end up with a huge clump of hair after i shampoo anymore. i usually put more at the ends because thats the driest part of my hair n leave it on for 7-10mins then wash it with warm then cold water after. i have used other masked before and this is the only one that i have noticed my hair seems to be healthier, has more volume n no dry ends."
5,Great for fine hair,"I love this hair mask. It smells great and works great. I have extremely fine hair so I have to be careful that the products I use don't weigh it down. As long as I don't use this more than twice a week, it won't weigh mine down. And that's saying a lot! This makes my hair much softer. It says to leave it in for 5-7 minutes which really isn't so bad. Just get everything else done and rinse this out last."
2,*Shrug,I really didn't notice a change in my hair after using it. Didn't make it softer or healthy looking. Maybe your hair has to be really dry and damaged to take advantage of this product. I would say it smells nice. A little bit like how Herbal Essences used to smell (but not as good) before they changed it to the fruity scents they have now.
4,Worth a try!,"This isn't a bad review. I saw a review on this product on YouTube by Tessahlations. This product was reviewed for all hair types including mixed/ bi-racial hair like mine.I have chemically relaxed hair and applied a keratin treatment 3-months after my chemical relaxer to help transition from relaxed to natural.I purchased this product on amazon for a great price. It worked fine with my keratin. I admit I wasn't using this product 1-2 times a week instead I was using it twice a month. Initially, I loved this product. The smell was great! It left my hair feeling incredibly soft and silky.As my hair grew, I noticed the product didn't smooth or control my frizz. My hair was also thicker after use. Aragon hair treatments work better for my mixed frizzy,wavy hair.This product is definitely worth trying."
2,Fell flat,"I tried this shampoo after reading multiple reviews on another website (I think [...]?). It didn't do much for my hair. I did try to stay with it as multiple reviews said you needed to keep using it for a couple of weeks, but it actually seemed to build up in my hair and weigh it down. Also, the smell is not one I would choose. It's not HORRIBLE, but it's really not enjoyable."
1,Fake product :( Shame on you Amazon.com,"I should have realized that something was wrong when I was able to purchase the Macadamia repair mask for 1/2 price. I always thought Amazon double checked everything they sold so I didn't think twice when ordering from them. I was wrong. I knew this product was a fake after opening it, it smelled different & had a completely different texture than the real macadamia repair mask I had purchased at my hair salon. After using it I saw no difference in my hair at all. Disappointed with Amazon.com :("
2,don't buy,"Save yourself the money and buy some olive oil instead. No noticeable difference in my hair. It does smell nice though. I use it like conditioner (since it says to apply to wet, clean hair) once a week. The packaging is nice."
2,"Totally, and completely OVERRATED!","I purchased this product because I needed something equipped to handle thick, coarse hair to make it smooth and more manageable. The product smells great, a little bit goes a long way and purchasing the bigger jar is definitely the better buy BUT, there was nothing at all spectacular about this product. I picked up some Suave conditioner for $1.72 a bottle at Wal-Mart to do a quick rinse in between washings. Well, I decided to use that conditioner in place of this and when I tell you that I got the EXACT same results I am 100% serious. As a matter of fact, I'd say I even preferred the effects of the Suave conditioner over this. Save your money! There are other products out there that are cheaper that will give you the same, if not better results!"
2,Poor packaging,The nails shipped loose in a large unlabled box. I can't tell if quantity is correct. I have concerns about how they will feed in the nail gun since they are not packed straight and neat.Not the same as other products from amazon on this vendor.
5,great Military strategy,the military strategy was outstanding and throwing dragons into the mix made it more interesting.
2,Not Lame maybe a Charlie Horse,"I liked the first two books much more than this one. Up to the point he sails off in search of the dragons he deals with the aftermath of a war that changed everyone. What was exciting about people has ceased to be exciting, and relationships start collapsing. Then it does get lame as he heads off in search of the land of the dragons. It feels like the first part of the book was a novella that lacked a satisfactory ending and he desperately grabbed for anything to come up with a rock-em sock-em ending (which it wasn't)."
1,Lame,The first 2 books in the trilogy were interesting and fun to read. This third one is a sorry attempt to carry on a series that in reality ended after the second book.
1,Bad product and service,I pointed this thing at several known hot spot and didnt get it to recognise it. Several others who bought this said the same thing.Called customer service and the lady was rude and tech support didnt know anything.I am very upset. dont buy from irock.
4,works for me,I have had very good luck with the iRock. I can drive by areas I think have hot spots and this device takes me right to them. Well worth the money
2,Runs really narrow and small,"Cute, but runs really narrow and I ordered a half size larger than my daughter takes."
4,A Super Gift,What else can I say than as a gift for a lovely girlfriend who lost her first Raggedy Anne doll which Ir eplaced last year I thought that Raggedy Anne would be lonely without a boyfriend so I am giving her this Raggedy Andy doll for Valentine's day this year.
3,So far my son had not show interest in it,"As expected good quality, right size so far my soon is not interest in it but I am sure he will be later."
3,Maiden Flight an interesting Plight,"I received this book as a gift from a friend, and although I do consider myself a sci-fi fan, I was even surprised at how quickly I poured through this book. The plot is interesting, the concept of living in the sky is exciting, and things are very well explained. It's not a very hard read, and the style of writing reads more like a Harry Potter than a Isaac Asimov.If you've got a couple of hours to kill, then pick this up and it should fill in the time admirably."
2,Not really Science Fiction,This book is more about an adulterous love affair between an airship captain and a engineer than SF. Throw in a side story of teenage angst and you have a thoroughly boring book. There are also many spelling errors and difficult grammar.
5,The first three tracks on this cd are very good,"This is definately the best Prodigy single. It includes an excellent live version of their law and Poison, which is very different from the original. And also there is an instrumental track: ""the trick"". This one, the Poison single and the Out of Space single are worth to buy."
2,Dollar store ones are equal,"Heat resistant my butt. It started melting the first time I used it. I do like that it's rounded, much better to use for pancakes. But I see nothing better about this Oxo from the ones I buy at the dollar stores."
3,Huge spatula!,This spatula is designed for large really large pancakes. It is useful for this purpose only. Probable use will be limited.
4,Great for pancakes,"It is very flexible, which is great for pancakes but, not so great for other items. However, I was looking for a great pancake flipper!"
4,Strength and Comfort,"This item has performed beyond my expectations. The reason I purchase this spatula was for pancakes, how ever I have found that I have been using it for everything. If there is any negative comments about this item I guess it would be the length of the handle. I do like the metal neck that allows the spatula to be placed on edge of pan without getting hot or melting."
2,NAMES ON THE LAND.....,"Quite a disappointment, actually two of them since the book I ordered at the same time, How the States Got Their Shapes, was disappointing also. Truly a record to get two losers at the same time. I disliked this book so much I stopped reading it. Very boring which is a shame since I am normally interested in this subject. I love American history also but this book didn't cut the mustard for me. I think it may have gotten better if I had stayed with it but I had had enough. Sorry there aren't many reasons given to backup my review. It was such a forgettable book, to me, I simply forgot them."
4,Pretty good for a first,Good songs. Good Vocals. Kinda short but still a very good first record. I really enjoyed the buried track after song 5. I will definitely be looking for Valhere's next record.
4,Novio Boy: A Play,"I like this book called Novio Boy. I thought this book was good from the beginning. It is about a boy who likes an eleventh grader. Her name is Patricia. And he asked her on a date, but the problem is that he doesn't have enough money. So he and his friend Alex set up a lemonade stand. Even though business was slow he earned enough money to go on the date. So back at Patricia's place she and her friend go to the beauty parlor to get her hair done. Later that day Rudy meets Patricia at the restaurant called Steaks Steaks y mas Steaks. Back at Patricia place Alicia and her go to get Patricia's hair done. Later that day Rudy meets Patricia at the restaurant, they go in and sit down and order. Everybody shows up at the restaurant."
3,My review,"The books name is Novio boy. It is about a boy and a girl the boys name is Rudy. The girls name is Patrica.soon They are going on a date to Steak, Steak y mas Steaks. They live in southern California it doesn't say what city.I like it because it was fun saying the girl's parts. I didn't like it because there were too many Spanish words."
4,Novio Boy Book Review,"The book that I am going to talk about is called Novio Boy. This book is about a 14 year-old boy who is in the 9th grade going on a date with a 16 year-old girl in the 11th grade. They are two years apart in age. The boy's name is Rudy and the girls name is Patricia. Rudy's mother does not approve with him going on a date with a woman two years older than him and Rudy's mother does not know he is going on the date with Patricia.Rudy is a small, sweet, and funny 9th grader and Patricia is a tall, romantic 11th grader. Rudy and Patricia are going to eat at restaurant named Steaks, Steaks, y Mas Steaks. They did not know that Rudy's mother and uncle were going to be there too. During their dinner they were talking about cats. Then Rudy Uncle Juan started to play his guitar.Here is some of the Spanish words them us in this book:Mas-MoreNina- GodmotherNovia/o-sweetheartPapi- daddyRaza- the Latino peopleVato- guyViva La Raza- long live our people"
3,navio boy,Novio boy is a book about a boy named Rudy and a girl named Patricia .Rudy asked an older to go on a dtae with him and she says yes.The whole play is basically about Rudy preparing and getting advice about what he should do on the date.I liked the book it was very interesting to meet all of the chartactres in the book. I would give this book three stars.
3,Novio Boy,Novio Boy is a good book because it kind of reminds me of my first date. It mainly is about a boy name Rudy is taking an older girl on a date. At first he can't find any money and then his uncle helps him out. And then that night comes Rudy goes on his date with Patricia.Rudy's uncle is singing at the restaurant that Rudy is taking his date to. Rudy and his date are at the restaurant and his mom and Estella come spy on him. Then Rudy finds out that Patricia really likes him even thou she is two years older.
3,novio boy book reveiw,I REALLY LIKE THIS OR PLAY. THIS STORY IS ABOUT PATRICIA AND RUDY GOING ON A DATE BUT RUDY DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY TO GO SO HE AND ALEX WAS SELLING APPLES FOR RUDY TO GO ON THE DATE WITH PATRICIA.
3,My Report,"Hey, this is Robert and I'm going to tell you about a book called Novio Boy. I liked this book because when we read it as a class we made it interesting. When we read it the boys read the girls parts and girls read boys parts. I thank it was more fun that way.But also there were some things. I didn't like. Like at the end they never tell you what happen to the old man and Estella. Or Rudy and Patricia after there first date. Also they don't tell you what the old man meant when he said he was married some times. Well that is what I think about the book Novio Boy."
4,My great review on novio boy,"In my seventh grade class. My fellow students and I are reading a very great book called Novio boy. The play is about how these two very nervous teens. Are very scared to go on a date with each other. If you really think about it, they both really need each other, because he has never been on a date with an older girl. As well she doesn't have as much experience in that dating area. I really think Rudy and Patricia make a great couple. Because different people go great together. Because she is in the eleventh grade, tall and romantic, Rudy is in the ninth grade, small, sweet and funny. My favorite seen is when they went on there date. They seemed like they had a good time. And I wish I could eat the food they had it seemed great."
4,my reveiw of the most twisted play ever,"Guess what?! My class is reading an outstanding book called Novio Boy!The book is about a boy named Rudy fromSouthern California who has a date with a girl named Patricia. But the thing is that Rudy has never been on a date! He then starts to take advice from his best friend Alex. Alex is helping his friend from his experience of going on a nine year old date to the park. At the restaurant near the end however, Rudy turns out to be himself and earns a girlfriend, if you know what I mean! Patricia loved everything about Rudy, but hated her hair almost more than she hated the fact that her mother already knew about Rudy, and was listening to every word her and Rudy had spoken!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Patricia's Novio Boy,"The book Novio Boy was a good book and play. It is about a girl named Patricia going out wit a younger boy named Rudy. They both are very excited about their date together both are very nervous to. The characters in this book are Patricia, Alex, Rudy's Mother, Uncle Juan, Estela, Old Man, El Gato, Mama Rosa,Alicia,and Alex Rudy's best friend. The book Novio Boy is a good book and play you should read it you will like it. That is Novio Boy."
5,Novio Boy Review,"The play ""Novio Boy,"" by Gary Soto, is really great. It's about a boy named Rudy, who's in ninth grade. His life is fine, except that the girl he likes is in eleventh grade. He has to build up a lot of courage to ask her out. It's really funny when Rudy's best friend, Alex, is telling him about when he went on a date. In my class, we connected that part to the movie ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" and did a little impromptu. Overall this play is really funny and is great for class or for just reading by yourself (though it's more fun to act it out). This book is really just one big coincidence, and if you read it, you'll find out what I mean."
3,Exciting story of the life of a Hispanic teenage boy.,This book would definately appeal to readers ages 9-12. The book has a great storyline and does a good job of using 90's slang that would keep younger readers wanting to read more. I would not recomend this novel to anyone high school age or older.
3,novio boy book review,"I like Novio boy, it's alright. I like all the challenging,Spanish words. They make the book more fun to read. This book has two main characters, Rudy and Patricia. They are best friends. One of the best parts of the book is when Uncle Juan sang one of his songs with a rap like beat it goes something like this:Tort pushed Frijoles on my plateShouting ""TAKE THIS TAKE THAT.""Frijoles, our piping brown brother,Got mad and said, ""meet you outside homie!I'm gonna gas you up!There is a little more but it too much to type. I liked the end of the book the begging was good to. I would recommend this book to another student, because it's a good book."
2,omg its a book,"Alright my class has just finished this book it's pretty good. This book is about two main characters. One's a boy named Rudy and his in the ninth grade. The other's a girl in the eleventh grade. There are a lot of other characters in it like Rudy's mother and his best friend.Ok now I'll tell you more about this book. The book is about this two high school kids going out to lunch together, and on the way to the day they go out it tells about the other people in the story and how the two people started going out. The book starts out with Rudy and his friend Alex talking about what he should say and ask about on his first date.Last I'm going to tell you the things I liked and disliked about the book. First thing I liked was that it had my name in it, and the second thing was I learned some more Spanish. The one thing I disliked is that it was written like a play."
4,Drywall bits,These bits are great for drywall. I have been using them to put in the outlet holes. It goes through drywall with ease and it makes accurate cuts. The double-end makes it last twice as long!
5,I miss this record,"Been looking for this one for years. I just became aware that it had oh-too-briefly been reissued, and then disappeared again. Got an old LP out in the garage that's totally worn out, and no record player anyway, so add my voice to the chorus of pleas for a re-issue that will last! So many favorites here, and every one of them is in my blood...hearing the clips it's as though I had just heard them yesterday (and was 10 years old again!). Great great record, and a piece of cultural history that needs to be available."
4,DOES THE JOB!,The Telpro Troll does the job! The only thing that would make it even better would be a longer handle.
5,Very handy for a specific job,"The Troll is a modest looking tool, but it is amazing for moving full sheets of plywood around the shop. You simply lift one end of the sheet, work the troll into the middle, then roll the sheet where you want it. Balancing the sheet on the Troll is not difficult and steering the sheet is easier than trying to carry it. If you have to move a full sheet of plywood by yourself very often, this beats the alternatives. As other reviewers have noted, the handle is too short for you to hold while moving the sheet. It rests against the sheet. I wouldn't recommend grabbing the handle, picking up the sheet, and using this as a carrier. The plywood can slip around too easily. Buy a Gorilla Gripper for that."
5,A huge help,"This is one handy piece of equipment for the ... ahem ... older set. No problems transporting 4'x12'x3/4"" sheets of MDF or 4'x8'x5/8"" sheets of drywall. It's well balance and the large urethane (?) tires handle most floor imperfections. Yes, it's a bit short but that's easily remedied with a lifting strap. My back thanks me every day I use it. Go get it!"
2,Tool Roller,"The handle is too short to use when rolling a 4X8 sheet of plywood. You have to bend over so much to reach it that you can't see forward enough to roll it. It is built solid and would be outstanding if the handle was around 7"" longer. The small wheels limit the tool for use on flat hard surfaces. Will not roll across thick grass. If the handle was extended this would be great!"
4,Not perfect but very useable. A back saver!,"At first I would have agreed with some of the other reviewers and their opinions that the handle on the Troll is too short, but after using this thing for a month, I've gotten pretty comfortable with it and probably wouldn't have liked it if the handle WAS longer. I've been carrying MDF, drywall, and plywood and find it much easier using the Troll than old fashioned manhandling of these sheet goods. I'm 6'6"" tall and find the handle lift height is just about right for me especially going up stairs into the house.I thought the wheels would be a great asset but find that they create more of a problematic balancing act than they're worth and I would rather lift and carry the panels than roll them.Overall, I'm pretty pleased with the Troll and wish I'd gotten one sooner."
2,Troll is for trolls,"This little wheeler is so short, that an average man has to stoop over to us it."
3,It's OK,"For light panels and maybe some sheet rock it works OK, but don't try to move 4' by 8' sheets of 3/4"" MDF with it. The handle would be better if you could adjust it (the height). Also the wheels are held on with press rivets -- they look sturdy but I would feel better if they used nuts instead. Bottom line, works good for lighter stuff, but if you have some real heavy or bulky panels/objects to move -- nothing beats an extra person (or persons) to help."
2,Might work well if you are short,"I bought this tool to help me haul large sheets of plywood. Many good reviews, but this tool must have been made by someone 4 feet tall. The handle barely comes pas my knees. At 6ft2in tall I anticipate having issues with the ultra short handle."
2,Lacking substance,"For someone who is not familiar with, for example, Susan George's work, this was an interesting general introduction into how multinational corporations in combination with governments exploit poor countries around the globe. However, I found it overall vague and would have liked more facts.The last part of the interview, in which he talks about how our planet could become a better world for everyone, was annoying because he didn't present any ideas as to how this could be accomplished. The world might indeed be a better place if the ""corporocracy"" could be eliminated or at least reigned in, but that's much easier said than done - and what are we to do in the meantime?All in all, at least in my opinion, not much (factual) substance here."
2,"Great Poet, Lousy Singing Voice","John Trudell is an inspirational poet who touches my heat with his words. That said, his songs are terrible. I could not believe how good the music was and how bad it sounded when he started talking. I recommend his books of poetry but not his CDs."
2,Not a great Cd,"I first found out aboot the Slumber Pary Girls a few years ago, when they were on channel 2 (CBS) and I watched ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch"" (the new cartoon version), and ""Trollz"". I though that the CD would be pop-y and bubblegummy, but it was like hip hop and dance. Most of the songs lacked tune and the only good songs were the two from the ""Bratz"" movie: ""Summer's Gone"" and ""My Life"". Carasoul was also okay. Don't buy the CD unless you really want something new to listen to."
3,DANCE REVOLUTION CD,"I REALLY COULDN'T SAY, I BOUGHT THIS FOR A GRAND DAUGHTER'S GIFT, SHE LIKES IT!!"
5,Done using [...],"The product itself was exactly what I needed. Even had a couple dollar discount from the local store. However, the ridiculous wait didn't make it worth it. I'm done using Amazon from this point forward. Very unhappy with the inability to put something in a box and ship it."
4,Alt country Vibe + Quirky Songwriting = Good Stuff,"Jason Collett has a voice that's appealing, easy and versatile. This album makes me want to be friends with him. Great solo record and good to listen to on a sunny day (regardless of the season)."
5,Do your ears a favor and buy this album,"If you like Bettie Serveert this will become your favorite of all there albums. If you have yet to hear them start with this one. You will be immediately drawn in and will proceed to purchase the rest of there albums. (palomine, lamprey, dust bunnies) You won't be disappointed.It is great alternative pop. If you ever liked Belly or The Darling Buds or even the Throwing Muses you will embrace Bettie Serveert. Not to say they are anything like any of the aformentioned, but they definitely are in the same vein.It is the one album I have to listen to on a daily basis."
2,This book is not original at all.,"I found this book to be complete and rather heavy in a class of book that is supposed to be light and airy. It is well written and contains all of the correct facts and figures, but is missing that certain spark to make it very good, never mind excellent."
4,What One Man Can Do,"This was a wonderful movie. James Earl Jones (one of my personal favorites) plays the part of a recently widowed man who doesn't know what to do with himself after his wife's death.Thinking of what his wonderful wife told him, he took on a project that many thought could not be done. But he showed what one man can do, as long as he has the patience and will to do so. In working on this project, he gained the love and trust from those he came in contact with, even those who doubted him, and his adversaries."
1,The Reading Room,"We were very dissappointed with this DVD. The sound was very low, even though we had the TV turned up as loud as it would go. Also, my husband could not enjoy the DVD because it did not have Closed Captioning. My hearing is fine, but even I had a hard time hearing it.We were very dissappointed in this DVD."
4,Delightful,This movie is a remarkable piece done with James Earl Jones; This is very well a family affair movie and the episodes touches your emotions in a nice way.
1,Not worth your time!!!,"One I am a great fan of constance o'day flannery, her time travel series are simply put, out of this world. i really would like to know what made her think that she could write about a super secret agency of shape shifter out to help the world one high powered person at a time, is beyond me. This novel dragged on and on and on..... The string of though is endless, the reaccuring ex-lover/mentor/trainer in and out of her life is a bit trashy! I would not buy this novel if I were you."
5,Hilarious!,"From the flying rabbit fairy to the portly female piglet (Hester), this book is hilarious. The text is simple and energetic, and the story starts off with a bang--you know what the problem is, and you want to know how the little piglet is going to fix it. The illustrations are comical--in keeping with the tone of the story. When I was a child, this was one of my all-time favorites. I just adored Hester. She's an ingenious little piglet who finds a solution for everything."
4,Serious Foreign Policy Book,"Pillar's importance has come to light to ""the mainstream"" of American thought after his piece titled ""War, Policy, and the War in Iraq"" came out in Foreign Affairs critizing the current war. Pillar, however, has had a long established career in foreign policy work. The book is not an ""easy read"" and is quite technical, but it is an essential read if you want to know what our country's top analysts think is the best way to deal with ""terrorism"". Furthermore, his insight into Bin Laden and his Al-Queda organization is very interesting as this book which was written before 9/11."
5,Remarkable DVD,Very clever and funny. Unlike any comdian I have seen or heard. Highly recommend for anyone who wants a good laugh. AAAA+++++
1,Look for another book,"The author might be an expert at mathematics, though I don't see it from the book. Anyway, he obviously doesn't know much about baseball. If you've been reading BaseballProspectus, BaseballPrimer, Bill James or someone like him for some time, this is just not for you. It's too naive and too superficial. And if you've not read sabermetric articles, don't start with this book.The author developed a few formulas which lead to unexplainable, implausible outcomes, just combining unrelated numbers in a awkawrd manner. He hasn't even adjusted for park effect. So he ranked Larry Walker as one of the best hitters of all time. It's ridiculous.Don't buy this one. If you want to see things like this, just search the web, and you'll find lots of better ones in 30 minutes."
5,Happy and Glorious,"This is a sumptuously illustrated, well detailed biography of a most fascinating yet sad figure. King George VI, the father of Queen Elizabeth II, in all his reluctant glory. This is a lovely, respectful conversation piece book, but it remains substantial. See the points and highlights of the life of a monarch who would have preferred a quiet life as a princely royal duke...a king who had to struggle with his own disabilities while fighting his resentment of his brother, the abdicated King Edward VIII...a brave man who went out to the people after the bombing of WWII with his wife, Queen Elizabeth (The Queen Mother). Do not miss a chance to own the beautiful, spectacular and majestic English history in this book.Truly, the newer biography by Sarah Bradford is not much more substantial than this beautiful, wonderfully illustrated biography of a king who stands even now as an example for all of us. George VI embodies his WWII motto, ""KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON."""
4,good clamps,"I'm just a do it your selfer, I'm installing 1500 sqft of flooring in my own house. I bought 8 clamps, they our great for pulling joints together. I found that once joints our pulled tight that blue tape holds them in place. If clamps our pulled to tight your last row will come up. I could have easily gotten by with only 2 clamps."
4,Very finny,"Note to self: Do not write ""snail mail"" to actual snails.Doing so might seem harmless enough, but when Peter Alan caps a perfect day at the beach by tossing a note to his finny friends, they come a-calling:Where you live is pretty cool. You should come visit us someday. Plus my Mom makes good pies.The next day finds catfish mowing a lawn, puffer fish as birthday ballons, and an octopus who gives new meaning to bad hair day. It's all in surreal good fun, but little Peter eventually has to disinvite his smelly, slimy visitors.That's okay -- the story ends with a reciprocal invitation tucked into a conch shell.Gall hand-engraved the images on clay-coated board, then digitized the color. The result feels straight out of old Art Deco posters, but in a more contemporary palette of autumn tones and ocean hues.Watch for visual puns on every page: the sea horses at the rodeo, mice running from the catfish, etc. Even the end papers will keep you busy."
5,A Caldecott Contender,"I bought this book because my 3 year old nephew loves fish and spends a lot of time at the ocean. When it arrived I was amazed at the quality of the illustrations which most certainly could put this book up for a Caldecott Medal this year. Happily, my nephew was as enthralled with the pictures and the sweet story as I was. This is a book he'll enjoy for many years to come as will anyone who reads it to him. For the pictures alone, a new classic that belongs on every child who loves the beach's shelf."
5,Granddaughter loves it,"I bought this, along with "" Bible Action Songs"" for my 5 year old granddaughter. She loves the songs and asks me to play them for her. I remember these songs from when I was a kid. Its great seeing her enjoy them."
1,Lonely Planet Guide - Venezuela,"The Lonely Planet guide to Venezuela had a lot of inaccurate information! The prices quoted in the book were way off. The budget hotels they recommended were very dirty and usually had a ""bad reputation"" amongst the locals. I would not recommend this book to people traveling to Venezuela. There are better guidebooks out there. Basically, we threw out the book after 3-4 days as everything in it seemed to be outdated or grossly inaccurate. For very general information, it's ok - but take it with a grain of salt."
4,"Not up to the expected standard, and out-of-date !","Venezuela is quickly changing. Prices one day may double the next day. Politics and society are in fervid change. All in all, Lonely Planet has not managed to produce a guide up to the standard of other Lonely Planet guides. Having said that, I do not know of any better guides on Venezuela, and this is still a book worth taking with you. Though you will have to take all its advice and contents with some care, not for granted."
3,Not Weyl's finest writing,"Space, Time, MatterandSymmetryare two true classics by this arthor.This book translates badly and the subject has been covered better and more clearly by others like:The Principles of Mathematics.The KAM theorem made Weyl's arguments obsoleteas it gave a better technology for the rational number continuumapproximations used in these kinds of discussions. He never quite made his circulus vitiosus idea work."
2,Runs larger than expected,"I agree with the previous reviewer who says it runs large. Potential to be very beautiful and comfortable - but only at the right fit. I wear Trotters size 8.5 - but this ""Janet"" pump fit me about a full size larger than those do - even though it says ""8.5"""
4,To boost their stars a bit...,"In truth this may be more of a 3 or 3.5 star disc. I see where S. Rowland from rant-zine.com is coming from (and his webzine is cool too-- check it out) but I personally don't have a problem with the fact that The Hospitals are noisy and messy. They don't do the retro thing; it is beyond that, and I applaud them for it. I like this album quite a lot, and I sure don't like much music that has come down the pike in the last 15 years, so that's saying something. I wouldn't call it essential exactly either, but it is miles above most rock and roll these days. Definitely beats White Stripes. I hear this album as kind of a mix of Coachwhips and something noisier and more free like Sightings. Maybe it is a bit more on the side of traditional songs than the amazing Sightings, but they are a lot more loosely structured than Coachwhips, etc. It's a good one to chew on. Try it and see!"
4,Incredible footage of one the best stage performers ever!,"Amazing live performances captured on film are the reason to see to see this.The interviews with Janis don't reveal much, and there's no real sense of her history. Even the stage stuff is shot pretty straightforwardly, but, man-o-man could she sing!One wonderful thing is that a lot of the numbers are uncut, allowed to go their full length, which, with Janis in concert, could easily be 8 minutes or more. The power, the emotion, the energy, the sexiness, the sweet sense of fun she brought to the stage could only be hinted at on her albums. For those reasons it's more than worth sitting through the slightly homogenized off-stage material.It awful to think that this is essentially unavailable. Time for a decent DVD re-release!"
4,Janis: The Way She Was,"Awesome video. Interviews and performances are special. There is not much out there on Janis which is why this is such a great video. Tape came in great condition and as advertised. Quick shipping. If you like Janis, this video is a must have! I was lucky enough to see Janis live in 1968 when she performed in Cleveland, Ohio. She has always been my favorite female performer. Get this video if you can!"
4,Wonderful Company and Treats,"Picked these up while in Newfoundland one summer. My Boxer loved them so much I contacted the company directly and had a case sent to my house. For sensitive or food allergic dogs, these organic treats are a dog savers. Very pleased to see that these are being offered on Amazon."
5,i love it,my nephew love this wallet i give it to him for christmas. he really into jimmy neutron allday long jimmy jimmy neutron
2,Early Elgarts,"I've never heard the CD of these two albums but I have listened to the LPs. Even if they remastered these two albums to make them sound good, you might be better off looking for the later Elgart stuff. These albums were recorded in the early to mid 50's. I found the arrangements to be very simplistic, predictable and boring. Don't listen for any piano solos. The Elgarts never used a piano in their recordings. The bass trombone is always evident which I think makes the Elgart sound somewhat distinctive. I've listened to many Elgart albums over the years and I would suggest ""Great Sound of Les Elgart"" or ""Best Band on Campus"" as alternates. The early Elgart recordings may be OK for dancing but not much for listening."
1,Best Show Worst Game,This games is so bad I'll never try to play a game by Pressman or B1 games again. Obviously no human testing went into this game. Spending 1/2 hour or more trying to figure out one challenge is not fun at all. I've never had a worse experience playing a game.
3,I enjoyed it.,"I have to say I had some trouble at first. It is hard to figure out how to control movement in some games. I eventually checked the website and found hints to get the timing down. There were also a lot of tips that might be helpful if you're stuck in certain areas. So with a little help, the game was pretty fun."
1,Lamest thing since Kim Bauer vs. a Mountain Lion,"As others have stated the DVD mini-games are nearly impossible to play due to wonky controls. I also have no idea what the cards or pieces are for, other then they may come into play if you ""win"" the main game.They should have just done a choose your own adventure type game. It would have been less high-tech, but you could at least have a laugh when you choose ""set up a perimeter"" and the terrorists once again escape.DO NOT BUY."
2,24 game,"This game was put together with a nice concept, be a CTU agent and help Jack Bauer stop the terrorist attack. Also, I liked the fact that there is a mole and that someone right next to you could destroy the whole game. However, the interactive games and such used to get more clues are not made well. Though you try to do what it tells you to do, it doesn't seem to work. Since these interactive parts are so simple, yet not made in a way that one can control what is going on, you waste your time trying to do them and you never get to the end. I had three college students and two adults try it adn no one could seem to get it to work correctly. So, if some bugs were worked out, this game could be a much bigger success."
2,Too Hard,"This game is very very hard. The concept sounds cool but i would not recomend to purchas this item. After about the 2nd turn everyone just says this is impossible. Then everyone starts working together, not using the board, not doind the right turn, and looking through all the clue cards. It is not a fun game in my opinion"
1,Very very frustrating,"My wife and I just wasted the last hour or so on this game before we got too frustrated and gave up. We got stuck on both of the camera puzzles in day 1. It seems that it doesn't matter what you do on the remote, it will just keep failing you over and over. Since our DVD player can be a little flaky from time to time, I tried it in two other players- but that didn't make any difference. The board has nothing to do with the game, except for the ""extended play"" part. But I'm sure very few people make it that far! I'm going to see if I can get in touch with the manufacturer. They should do a recall."
1,Impossible to play,"This game is a complete waste of time. Four college educated adults were unable to complete this game. It is extremely poorly designed and flawed in too many ways to list here. The instructions are not clear for each of the mini tasks along the way, and are impossible to complete due to a delay with the remote. It becomes a game of will and luck, rather than skill. They should pull this from the shelves and refund all money spent. If the company that made this game had tested it - even ONE TIME - they would have seen that this game is completely ridiculous and crappy. The actual board part of the board game was completely useless, because you have to complete a day to get the code for extended play. We were unable to get a code. Sad, really. Please do not buy this game! If I could rate it a zero, I would."
1,Reading the reviews is the best part,"I bought this for my husband's birthday last year, never questioning why it was on clearance. We were very excited to play, since we are big 24 fans. There's no need for me to go into the problems; they've been covered by all the other reviewers. After we tried unsuccessfully to complete the assignments, and got yelled at by Jack too many times, my husband decided to read the reviews here.We laughed until our sides hurt at the ridiculously accurate descriptions of the worst game in the world. It's like the saying goes, ""When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."" We had more fun reading the reviews than playing the game.We passed the game on as a prank to my parents' friends.Me: ""Why doesn't this game work?""Engineers: ""We'll explain later! You're gonna have to trust us on this one!"""
1,Big fan of 24...worst game ever,"We were really excited to try this game. It was disappointing to say the least. The board has nothing to do with the game...at least for the main portion of the game. You really don't have control over the flow of story and the mini games range from easy to impossible, but are consistently boring. Honestly, not worth the time it takes to play, let alone to spend money on."
1,The Opposite of Fun,This game is quite terrible. The format of the DVD causes any sort of reaction based game on the disc to be impossible. My girlfriend was ready to throw the remote into the HDTV after playing it for 30 seconds. It's not even worth a dollar. I suggest you watch the show instead -- you'll have a lot more fun!
2,A little off,"I bought this thinking it would be a fun game to try out, as me and my wife are huge fans of 24. After 20 minutes I was frustrated and my wife had given up on it entirely. The game consists of very little reasoning, and mostly following patterns the game flashes on screen that you must, in a variety of frustratingly difficult and poorly-explained ways, input back to the game to move on. If you're not sure what the game wants you to do, there really isn't much you can do besides enter things randomly until you hit upon something by accident. Its incredibly frustrating. The voice acting is quite good though (Keifer Sutherland is here), and the live-action sequences were better than I expected from a DVD boardgame. However, overall this game was a disappointment and it may be some time before I store up a reserve of patience to attempt it again."
1,Not good...,"I too purchased this game thinking it would be excellent, as I am a huge fan of the hit tv show and I had read on the internet that Kiefer Sutherland himself had provided his voice for the game... I couldn't have been more wrong. After about 3 minutes of gameplay me and my girlfriend were stuck in seemingly impossible tasks, having to use the DVDremote as a 'wanna-be' gaming-console controller....this doesn't work at all (not surprisingly).I am surprised and disseapointed that so much money and effort has been put into such a terrible game. I predict that word will spread and that this will not sell as much as predicted."
1,Waste of time and money,"Sure wish my mother-in-law had read these reviews before giving this to me for Christmas. Tried to play it once with my parents, who are also big 24 fans, a few nights later and were sorely disappointed. This game was obviously just shoved out the door to feed off the popularity of 24 the show and not to garner any popularity in its own right.The mini-games were an exercise in extreme frustration. The problem is that the DVD is not ideal for those mini-games. Whenever you try to move there are only two subsequent animations: the successful one and the unsuccessful one, which made it seem like it was just moving at random. Other than that it seemed like the game was going to be pretty linear, the clue cards contained no useful information, and the board completely superfluous, unless apparently you are masochistic enough to get to the bonus level."
2,Much too grand for me,"I was looking for a more real world book on Swedish interiors, i.e., color palettes, decor ideas, etc. This book depicted lavish, extravagant rooms that would be more in keeping with very high-end decorating. If I had a castle, perhaps....Wonderful photos of truly beautiful rooms, indeed, but the uptopian flavor of the book matched its price, so rather than keeping it on the shelf, I returned it."
3,intermediate players a prerequisite,"The instuctional part is good but the animated fretboard does not always follow what the instuctor is doing on the guitar, it sometime plays the notes in a differant position on the guitar.It is very helpful to know the notes repetitive postion on the fretboard other wise you may have a hard time following how the instuctor is playing.good cd but probably not for the beginner."
3,Almost perfect circles,"This rotozip Circle Cutting Attachment is very handy for making almost perfect circular cuts... I've used it a couple of times, and the circles were very accurate... Recommend highly..."
3,Handy in specific instances,"This is a good solution for certain situations:- Cutting ceiling tile for hi-hat - Speaker cabinets - Portholes in boats - cutting fiberlass shower stalls for large valve handlesIt is NOT good for:- Cutting arcs in plywood - Tile - Thick wood (over 3/4"")I found that the center point drifted in these applications, and it was too hard to affix the center point to the material being cut.Like the roto-zip, it's a tool of great usefulness in specific situations. I'd never get rid of my Jig-Saw, which picks up where this tool leaves off."
2,A messy job at best.,This cuts great circular holes and it's easy to use. The only bad thing I quickly noticed is that if you are trying to cut in a circular hole in a ceiling the airflow that normally keeps the cutting area clear blows the dust everywhere. It makes a big mess and throws more dust and debris in your face then using a circular saw or sawzall. It only rates 2 stars.
4,Rotozip Circle cutting in plaster,"I bought the Circle cutting attachment for cutting circular holes in a plaster ceiling for can lights. Previously I have used an electric jigsaw for this, but the RotoZip is wonderful as long as you use a 1/8"" solid carbide bit. Also be sure to drill a starting hole because of the danger of breaking the bit on the first insertion."
1,"Missing parts, doesnt work on SCS01","Received item was missing parts, did not include items pictured - thus, will not work on SCS01 regardless of what the description says. Saw another review that said the same thing - too bad I didnt read reviews before I purchased."
2,Missing circle adaptor part,I had the same problem as others in that the round adapter was missing from the sealed package. it does not work with the scs 01. pretty crappy. does anyone know how to get the adapter?
1,Image does not match product received,The image you are using does not match the product that was shipped. The manufacturer has changed the fastener. I needed the item as shown.
3,Missing parts,"Even though pictured in the catalog, the circle cutter does not come with the adapter for the model SCS 01 tool. I called Rotozip and they mailed me the adapter free of charge."
3,Not worth the trouble,This thing probably works in some applications. I found it more trouble to use than necessary. Just take out a Sharpy and mark a circle and cut it out.....That's my spin on it.
4,A Very Good Collection of Home Plans Found in this Book,"The overall content and organization of this book was very good. It adequately broke down houseplans by their characteristic features and there were plenty of color ones in the beginning of the book as well. The sample of smaller and larger plans by the square footage was excellent. Some houseplans were fairly conservative and functional while otheres were luxurious and had a flare of uniqueness I found refreshing. This is a great book to get if you are just starting out to build a custom home and need an initial foundation to start your search. In addition, the book did a great job in the ""Ordering"" section. It described what you would get in fairly good detail when purchasing a certain housplan. The cost was similar to most other houseplan books. Overall, this book is an asset to those who are initializing the search for their dreamhouse."
2,Could have used more info & a better editor,"I spent most summers of my childhood not to far from where this couple spent a couple of months -- so I was very excited to read this book especially because not much is written about this area -- actually very little! However, when I started to read it -- I was quickly bored -- it was a short and fast read about their stay with very little description about the area, no humor and nothing much to go on if you are interested in the area (how could they not include anything about Armagnac or Foie gras -- the two things the area is international known for?). I am giving it 2 stars because I want more books written about this little known area of France, but this one need a lot more to keep me interested and engaged --sorry!"
1,Not for Advanced Exercisers,"I like Gunnar and Brooke but this video is simply not challenging enough for the advanced exerciser. Also, I find the setting (a modern looking gym) to be a bit sterile and boring. Believe me, after repeatedly working out to the same video, scenery will matter."
1,Collection of papers,"It's a collection of papers u won't understand anyway. So instead of paying an exhorbitant price for only 200 pages, buy a Ferrari instead."
5,Good Job,"I felt like I was sitting in a barbershop listening to a guy on the edge of his seat talking about how bad his day went. From him inheriting brownstones to drug deals to women to crazy neighbors to cross dressing, this book was one entertaining read. I love how the author talked to the reader as if in conversation, from complaining about how he used to be able to climb fire escapes better to the crazy lady walking down the street.2nd look: I hadn't read the last chapter before I reviewed this book. If I could, I'd change the stars to one. I can't believe after this whole book with the narrator overcoming all these obstacles, he embraced the n-word. That is so discouraging."
5,Have done 5 living rooms now,Excellent product. Works as described. Much easier than hammering. I've had this for over 3 years now and it's still going strong. I've done 5 living rooms of hardwood floors.
5,Cheaper than buying glue.,"This stapler is reliable. This is also much cheaper than buying glue. Much faster also.. Glue down is a mess!! Only one misfire due to hitting subfloor nailing. otherwise well worth the cost. If you are installing over 400 square feet with two people, this tool is worth buying over renting.as it took me three full days in an odd shape room. I recommend buying staples B & C Eagle staples at the same time if you order from Amazon. 5000in one box is not too much if doing 400 sq. ft. givin 6"" o.c. nail spacing."
3,Native American spoken word.,"A spoken-word approach (it has music and backing vocals) and somewhat Native American (it's all in English). He's pretty good at it, really hitting it with ""Grafitti Man"" and ""Wildfires"". Interesting and novel, it's hard to imagine he would be without an audience."
5,Works well in fine hair & smells great,"I have shoulder-length, fine hair. This product gives me the ""boost"" I need for that voluminous look everyone's after. I use it with Got2B Fat-tastic mouse. The pump works great, and the product smells wonderful... very clean."

5,DISCOURSES ON THE IDEA OF DEVIL FROM PAST TO PRESENT,A wonderfully written and illustrated book takes you through the concept of devil from the ancient egypt to modern times. Paul ideas on the demonology of the christendom will keep you on the edge of your seat. A must buy classic!
3,Carus Drops the Devil Ball,"Mr Paul Carus comes at the problems of evil in society with a refreshing,albeit strained, neutrality. I think that Mr. Carus seriously digs Satan and this comes through in the background of his writing, especially when he came no longer hold his tongue in the witchcraft sections. He is a mighty scholar, tis true, but I wonder, Mr. Paul Carus, where is the discussion of our present understanding of evil? The Chapter ""In Verse and Fable,"" was a move in the right direction, but sadly, the book dries up before Carus can point to any application of his fine scholarship to our present existance, so it becomes simply a fine reproduction of the endless parade of devil literature..."
4,street punk rock n roll is back!!!,"finally after so much bland gutless music coming out of the punk scene this year, criminal class usa serves it up with a solid straight forward riot-along punk rock release. perfect mix of punk and no crap rock n roll. shout along choruses out the [ear], catchy hooks in every song that are addictive without being poppy and really great lyric writing. one of the best cd's i've picked up all year. proof again that GMM records (dropkick murphys, oxymoron, anti-heroes) doesn't make many mistakes."
1,Criminal Class USA CD Review,"This CD has got to be a joke. This band is not tight, the vocals are awful, really awful. I'm not sure who wrote the other reviews, maybe they were in the band, but there are not ANY catchy hooks. In fact, it's almost hard to tell when a chorus comes in. The songs have no structure and lack feeling. I do not recommend this to anyone, unless they like to listen to trash."
5,Wonderfully passionate singing!,"There are a lot of Renaissance compilations out there, but this one is truly worth having. Familiar works by Allegri and Palestrina find interesting partners in lesser known pieces by Rebelo and Guerrero. Truly first rate."
2,It's better than nothing,"I rented this game and within 10 minutes I was already bored. It's just plain boring. The backgrounds are bland and the ability to fly makes it way too easy. Even if you like the Powerpuff Girls show, you should stay far away from this terrible game."
4,Cute movie,This movie was a cute way to show my kids that bees are important to us and we need them. it was fun to watch.
4,Bee movie,"Entertaining. My granddaughter (age, almost 3 years) loves it and wants to see it over and over again."
4,Bee Movie (Full Screen Edition),"When the bee Barry B. Benson graduates from college, he finds that he will have only one job for his entire life, and absolutely disappointed, he joins the team responsible for bringing the honey and pollination of the flowers to visit the world outside the hive. Once in Manhattan, he is saved by the florist Vanessa and he breaks the bee law to thank Vanessa. They become friends and Barry discovers that humans exploit bees to sell the honey they produce. Barry decides to sue the human race, with destructive consequences to nature. The visual feel of the movie is incredible. Some of the bee hive interior and flight scenes were just breathtaking. This movie has lighthearted humor with playful animation for the entire family."
1,Cancelled!,The Bee Movie has been cancelled for HD DVD Release...why does Amazon still have it available for pre-order?
4,Perfectly acceptable.,"This is fine, ok to watch with your kids or grandkids. Tries a little too hard maybe. I find Vanessa strangely attractive, not Renee Zelwegger but Vanessa, the character. Strange."
4,Very entertaining,"I bought this for my grandson, who is not yet two. He watches it 2 - 3 times a day when he is over here. Actually, I am not tired of it yet. It has adult humor and the animation entrances kids."
3,bee minus score,why everyone loves this movie i will never know. the human bee interaction in the movie is just strange. the bee jokes got stale after awhile and the plot had potential then just got worse.I did not hate this movie it just was not great. Like a lot of modern day kid movies there are a lot of jokes made for the adults so I will not lie and say i did not laugh but maybe my expectations were a little too high.the funniest thing about this movie was the trailer on Shrek 2 dvd. If you own that movie look at the trailer. I give that a higher score than the actual movie
3,Cute,This movie was cute but not unforgettable. It was a nice flick to sit down and watch with the kids. No worries about inappropriate content.
4,Jerry Bee,"Bee Movie presents the daily life and worldview of a bee through the eyes of Jerry Seinfeld. Bee related humor and puns are abundant throughout. The typical day of busy bee life in the hive gets stirred up when Barry (Seinfeld) discovers that people are stealing honey from bees and putting the gold product (of hard work by bees) in jars to sell at the store! As a result, the bees take the humans to court. Celebrities are called to testify including Sting, ha-ha. John Goodman portrays the dramatic lawyer who represents the humans. He gives an over the top performance in the courtroom. Renee Zelwegger is Vanessa, a florist who befriends Barry even though bees are not supposed to talk to humans. Patrick Warburton plays her saccharine appreciative boyfriend who doesn't care for Vanessa being friends with a bee.The movie is cute and has some take-away lessons. Little things can make a big difference and every job is important in the overall scheme of things. Kids can learn about ecosystems too."
3,Bee Movie - surprize ending,"We found this movie to have good, simple messages that teach children how to be more aware of the environment and how there are consequences for actions and that things are connected. We really like how it is put across in a fun way. The only thing we did not appreciate much was the romantic allusions between the bee and the human lady - if it were more of a friendship that was suggested, we wouldn't mind. Does everything have to have romance in it - even children's movies? The ending of the movie was a nice surprize and made up for the minor disappointment of the romance stuff. Overall, a nice movie."
3,Don't know....,"what all the buzz is about! Yes, it is a cute movie and my ten your old did like it but there really much in the movie that had me rolling on the floor with laughter. It was a pretty clean movie but there was still a little inuendo here and there. It was pretty ridiculus. A human and a bee? What? Oh, well, it was a pretty good slice of entertainment but really, all the rave was a bit overboard."
3,"Decent movie, barely 4 stars","Well my wife wanted to see ""Bee Movie"" last night. So there I was hand in hand with my bride walking up to the ticket booth just to get striped of 20 dollars of my hard earned money. I really didn't expect too much from this movie. Oddly, this movie performed above my expectations (which is why I'm inclined to give it three stars). Although the movie is slow in spots, misses on it's humor on more than one occasion, and subjects the audience to Jerry Seinfeld's voice it still out performed itself.The positives of the movie are that it has what I will call it's ""enjoyable"" moments. For example, Chris Rock plays a mosquito and at the end of the movie works as a lawyer. I also think most children will enjoy the movie. In the end I'm not sad I saw the movie. However, it's definately a wait until it comes out on DVD flick."
3,30 Minute Lifespan,"The first 30 minutes are great -- far superior to Antz as far as the writing and animation go. Unfortunately, the rest of the film reminds you exactly why Seinfeld's sitcom was only a half hour in length -- the writers simply run out of steam and the plot bites off way too much before being quickly resolved. I mean, if you're going to spend years animating a script, why not choose one that made it past a few more rounds of editing? (6/10)"
4,A Pleasant Movie,"This movie features many voices we have grown to love, Jerry Seinfeld, Renee Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Chris Rock, Oprah Winfrey, Larry King, Sting, and more. While not being the best computer animation film out there, it holds its own well enough and is an enjoyable viewing experience for all ages. Some very young children won't get all the jokes, but the fun factor and eye candy make it worthwhile. I liked the spin put on the movie that bees could communicate with humans but weren't allowed to by traditional bee law. Complications ensue due to the law being broken by the main character Barry, and he ends up getting involved in a lawsuit meant to assist bees everywhere from being exploited for their honey. It goes well, but doesn't exactly turn out like Barry intended. Fortunately he finds a solution to the problem he unwittingly created. A solid four stars from me."
2,Dreamworks' Most Forgettable Film,"Out of all the Dreamworks' CG Animated films, this is probably the weakest (kinda interesting because the NEXT film ""Kung Fu Panda"" would be my favorite of all time). There's no comedy, no adventure, it's just bees talking to humans and humans being surprised by talking bees- *sigh*. I have only seen this once in my life and I barely remember that I even saw it. Jerry Seinfield is a bland boring uninteresting actor, the other characters are forgettable, Patrick Warburton is kind of funny, but he's an actor who have played in too many roles. The climax is boring and weak. Also the idea that bees can only choose one job and are stuck with it forever is just-terrible! For me, I can't find enough to like in this film. Personally, I'd skip this one."
1,"A few funny lines, but not worth sitting through",Many better kids movies to watch instead. Some parts of the movie not appropriate for children IMO. Overall one of the worst animated movies I've seen.
1,bee movie purchase,"I was so happy to receive Bee Movie because my kids never seen it and when I went to play it, it didn't work. I was very disappointed and so were my kids"
3,Good first try at cartoons for Jerry Seinfeld,"Dreamworks seems to be in perpetual competition with Pixar. Year after year they come out with CGI-animated movies dealing with weird and wacky subjects that try to be as innovative as the Pixar movie coming out that year. This one is one of the better ones by Dreamworks. Starring Jerry Seinfeld, it revolves around a bee who decides to sue humanity over our theft of ""their"" honey. The feel of the movie is bright; bright colors, bright music, cheery dialogue, and of course, bright-colored characters - bees. The setting is NYC with humor straight out of the Seinfeld TV show as befits the main actor. All in all, a good 1.5 hours of comedy appropriate for all ages."
4,Admiring colors,"in bluray, with the right calibration for your tv, this movie is going to be VERY colorful. With details that you just did not see from when you watched it on the dvd. Its a must have for any bluray lovers.sadly the sound quality is nothing to brag about"
3,"Beeware, this is no Toy Story","The first half of this movie is great. It was clever, funny, and original. The second half, while there were shining moments, fell short. Seinfeld was great, and his humor found its way through. Nearly all of the activity inside ""the hive"" was very entertaining. The problem with these types of movies is that it is becoming so easy to make them quickly. Movies like Toy Story and Monster's Inc. took years to make, which also gave them plenty of time to tweak and change the plot and script to make sure that it was perfect. Now that they take less time, and money, to make you end up with movies like this one (along with Madagascar, over the hedge, etc.) Yes, they are funny. However, in the end they don't quite measure up."
3,not the best,i got it as stated and on time i am a collector and it was cheap couldve been better and jerry seinfeld as a bee? pass
4,Bee Movie,"It may take you 20-30 minutes to get into the movie. But once you get in, you won't leave long after the credits started rolling. It's got Seinfeld written all over it. A G-rated Seinfeld at least. A good clean fun for the whole family."
4,Entertaining enough,"It was a good movie. An interesting movie. But I've seen better. The acting was fine, the animation, cute. It is worth seeing if you are a young audience, but definitely nothing to write home about. It wasn't boring."
4,Cute movie!,I loved this movie. I saw it at the theaters and I knew I had to buy it when it comes out on DVD! I can't wait. ONE more week to go!
4,To buy Bee Movie or not to buy,That was the question I had. I belong to blockbuster just so I can rent movies and save money. I am a real movie freak and I used to buy every movie that came out. Now I rent them and then if I like them I would buy. I thought the movie was OK but my 14 year old son loved it. It did have alot of humor in it. The more I thought about it the more things I liked about it. Although I thought the ending was alittle weak. But all in all a good movie to add to my dvd collection. Well worth watching!
3,"Good Overall, some jokes not appropriate for children",My husband and I enjoyed watching this movie but there were two things we didn't like for kids.1) It is one of those movies where you can't get to the menu until you watch all the previews and one of the previews is pretty scary if you have smaller children.2) There is a joke about the bee and the girl in the movie making a suicide pack. I just don't find this funny at all in a movie made for kids.
5,Seinfeld's first?,"I love the actor Jerry Seinfeld and when I found out that he was going to be in the movie ... I was really excited. The first time I watched I fell in love. Jerry was great in Seinfeld and now awed us once more with this great movie. All I have to say is ""bravo Jerry"", and I look forward to seeing if he stars in any other movies. I highly recommened this movie to anyone who wants alittle different storline to ants and bugs and penguines.Well done Jerry!"
4,Oh C'mon it's great fun!,"I took a date on to this movie and while we barely knew each other we had loads of fun watching it. We missed the first 10 minutes but got immersed in the plot/world immediately. No it's not high art, it's just a fun movie. I would say it's better than Antz and equal to some of the Pixar offerings. Enjoy."
5,Suprised,"I thought this movie was going to be the typical kids movie, I loved that it had adult jokes in it, that I am sure kids wont get. It was a really great movie that I know I will be watching numerous more times. If you think that this movie is just for kids your missing out on a great movie that can be enjoyed by all."
1,Truly one of the most awful movies I have ever seen...,"I don't even want to waste my time writing a review of such a ridiculous, inane movie but am doing so to (hopefully) save an hour and a half of someone else's life. I find Seinfeld mildly amusing, but Jerry's voice was actually painful to listen to in this film, and Renee Zellweger's character was nothing more than a squawking schizophrenic mess. The jokes were neither funny nor clever, and aside from the vibrant colors, the movie was exceedingly dull and difficult to watch. My three year old son and I didn't even make it to the halfway point. I'm surprised that this fruitless movie even made it to the theaters...it may have easily been one the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life."
3,Slow movie,Box new still in plastic. The movie itself is somewhat slow not that funny but my daughters wanted for christmas
1,Delivery of Bee Movie,"I ordered the Bee Movie for my Granddaughter's birthday. It arrived about a week late. I was promised delivery before her birthday, so needless to say I am NOT pleased with the service."

4,Bee Movie,"Quite a cute picture for all ages, the quality of animation is excellent, the story is sweet and funny. Well worth watching for any age."
2,nice movie,I heard great recommendations about this movie & I was a little disappointed when I watched it. The story was not interesting enough. Seinfeld's voice was the only nice thing about this movie.Einat[....]
3,"Cute, good ecology film for children, not profound for adults.","Bee Movie (Full Screen Edition)Cute, good ecology film for children, not profound for adults."
2,Glad I didn't go to the movies for this,"Just a little bit too boring. My daughter (8) found some bits funny as did I. Probably will not watch this again. Borrow someones copy, or for five bucks you can have my copy."
2,A C- for Bee Movie,"I bought this DVD Movie, thinking that after what these studios had done before, there wouldn't be any doubt about the quality of this movie. Unfortunately I was rather disappointed, very disappointed. It's a mess and there is unfortunately nothing really funny. There was a lot of potential with the subject and unfortunately the studios didn't use it. It's a movie to see once, but only on rent I would suggest."
4,Great movie,I bought this movie for my baby boy. He really love to watch this movie on his new DVD portable player
3,It's okay,"My son did not particularly enjoy it. I think the plot is more grown-up- like Antz. I liked it, but I never get to watch it because my son chooses the movies."
3,bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ;D,it's a cute movie. there are plenty of other computer animated movies i like a lot better - but this one has its moments! chris rock as the mosquito...OH MY GOSH!! HILARIOUS!!!! he cracks me up anyway - he's fantastic in this movie!!! would i run out and buy it tomorrow? (i actually own the dvd...) nah...it's one of those that if you collect animated movies - you should add it...but only at a decent price (i paid around 10 bux for mine - wish i had only paid 5...oh well...) - again - it's a good movie...worth watching once...
2,Ehh,"This movie was okay at most...I bought it for my 3 year old who lost interest pretty quickly. The story line was silly (but not silly in the sense that a child would enjoy it.) It was silly to the point of...who came up with this! Anyway, I wouldn't recommend for a child OR an adult..."
3,somehow loses the plot,"started off well.. then wheels start falling off. especially the interaction with humans, even ant bully was believable, somehow bee movie fails to be so.."
2,Pretty Bad,"Boring and not very funny.I'm glad I didn't pay money to see this.If your kid has a short attention span,then skip it!"
4,Bee Movie,I ordered The Bee Movie for my grandson for his 7th birthday. one of his friends has the movie and he asked me to get it for him. He and his brother and sister watched it that night and they loved it. I was happy with the fast delivery and free shipping!
3,"Okay, but tries too hard","Like many folks, I'm sure, I had high expectations for this movie. I enjoyed it in the theater but the buzz (bet you didn't see THAT coming, did you?) wore off soon after I pitched the popcorn container in the garbage. Jerry Seinfeld does a fair job in the unappreciated world of cartoon voiceover (just ask Nicolas Cage and/or Julia Roberts whose Ant Bully performances were horribly dull) and John Goodman is outstanding in his small but entertaining role. But the plot takes a bit long to get to the obvious point and the frighteningly real crisis in our world involving a demise in the bee population and the consequences therein is something that shouldn't be so easily remedied as it is here.There are plenty of funny moments and the thankful change from ants to bees was quite welcome, but I expected a bit more. I am still hoping for the Incredibles sequel or at least a return to that level of output from this crowded genre."
5,Don't think so hard,"loved it.my honey, Norman, and I just watched the delightful Bee Movie, and we loved it. laughed out loud nearly all the way thru it.maybe it's a ""kid's"" movie - but, we are an old married retired couple with no kids in the house and we laughed our asses off.the humor, in part, may go right over the heads of kids. little things like the Larry King part, kids are not going to get it. oh, kids will enjoy this movie, but, we adults need to not pass it up thinking it's ""just a kid's movie,"" as it is great for all ages.why compare it to Shrek, or Ice Age, or Monster's Inc?? it is nothing like those. it's a great funny nice movie.stop thinking so hard, you'll hurt yourself and you'll miss the delight in life.so says gramma Sally."
1,B movie,"It seems as though they made a list of every bee joke they could think of, and then designed a movie around it. and then, when that didn't make a movie that was long enough, they go into this whole muddled lawsuit thing. It's funny how kids seem to not like the movie when a grownup doesnt. and when the movie is well done, like cars, they love it. And no, they did not like this mess of a movie."
5,The Bee Movie,"We took our kids to see this movie and they all loved it. I liked it because they didn't include sexual innuendos like the Shrek movies I've seen. That always makes me angry that this type (sexual innuendos) of writing has to be included in what is supposed to be a children's movie. Anyway, this movie is great for small children as well as bigger kids. The jokes are funny, and my kids thoroughly enjoyed it. Although at one point it seemed rather weird that a bee can sue humans, it all fell into place in the end. We all have to realize that this is animation, not real life, so no real life acting should be portrayed. They all did a wonderful jobs doing their parts, especially Jerry Seinfeld. Well done! I will be buying this when it comes out."
2,"Give it a ""C""","Not painful to get through, but didn't offer much in terms of laughs or memorable scenes. Main character Barry B. Benson was decent, but the ""cute"" factor could have been bumped up a few notches. The weird relationship/emotional affair between Zellweger's character and the bee was a little strange and doesn't resolve itself even at the end of the movie when she continues the dependence on Barry as a friend and intellectual/emotional support instead of fixing things with her distant jock of a husband. Two and a half stars."
3,Bee Movie Gets a 'B',"This was a great movie for the kids, which is exactly why we got it. The connection between bees and pollen and the collapse of the economy is greatly oversimplified, but the animation is great and the jokes are funny. As long as you are prepared to explain how pollenation really works, you should be O.K."
4,My daughter loves Bee Movie,My daughter saw Bee Movie in the theater and had to have it on DVD. She's only 3.5 but can watch this over and over. And she loves the songs Sugar Sugar and Here Comes the Sun. Everytime they play in the movie she gets up and dances. I think this movie would bee good for kids of all ages. It was better than most animated movies.
2,A shallow movie,"Though the movie intended to be funny, it was pretty shallow. The starring bee of the movie, Barry Benson, finds that he is in love with a human, more specifically, a woman. It became awkward when it became clear that the woman had equal feelings for Barry too. Though the protagonist of the story took action of what he thought was right for himself and the community, he placed the whole bee community and human society down the drain. It was good that he took responsibility of his actions, but it wasn't quite what I expected it to be. Many scenes produced rude remarks and there was a scene about a grandma that was clearly NOT funny. Besides that, the ending of the story seemed rushed and without character. The makers of the film tried too hard to be funny and to create a ""fantastic movie with morals"", but it lacked both. It was a very disappointing movie, and I felt I could've done a better job at directing the movie myself."
5,Classic Seinfeld comedy.,Great movie. The adults as well as the kids will love it.The only problem is that the little kids will think bees are nice and can talk and might run up to them in the yard.
3,Don't wait for a record company -- you can have this now,"You can compile the album yourself -- all of these songs can be purchased from Amazon in mp3 format and burned to a CD. My mom loves this album and only had it on LP, so I'm buying her all the songs for Mother's Day. Here are the download links:In Concert- Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair- Fennario- House Carpenter- Jack-A-Roe- Once I Had a Sweetheart- Queen of HeartsIn Concert, Part 1- Matty GrovesJoan Baez- All My Trials- East Virginia- Fare Thee Well (10,000 Miles)- Henry Martin- House of the Rising Sun- John Riley- Mary Hamilton- Silver DaggerJoan Baez Volume 2- Barbara Allen- Lily of the West- Old Blue- Railroad Boy- Silkie- Trees They Do Grow High- Wagoner's LadRare, Live and Classic- Go 'Way from My Window"
4,Atlas of the Presidents....a must for children,"I purchased this book in the early 1980's, thus the last President mentioned is Ronald Reagan. The text is appropriate for children, comprehensive but not overly so. What makes Atlas of the Presidents special to me is the Electoral College map of each Presidential election. It breaks out which state voted for whom and which candidate had support in certain areas of the country. Although each Electoral College map of the country is given small attention in the book, they all reflect the historical attitudes of our nation. As the back of the book, it contains a table showing comparative data of each President, and John Kennedy advice to young people seeking the Presidency in the future."
4,A must-have addition to quilters' libraries,"Even in the first few pages of this book, I was learning something new about the use of colors in quilting. The book provides illustrations of color combinations and categories; as well as pictures of quilts employing interesting usage of color. There is plenty of wisdom packed into most of the sentences in this book so it is worth the reader's while to read carefully. My only point of contention with this book - and it is a minor one - is that I do wish there mught have been a few more pages, a few more illustrations! Despite that, I deem this a must-have for every quilter's library."
5,Love this book!,"I have been searching for books as guides in color selection. I love this book because it does not stress strict formulas using a color wheel. It does use a color wheel as part of the analysis of color selection, but it uses other methods also. The illustrations are great. This is a great book to have in your library."
4,good stuff,"very happy i bought this book last minute as i didn't have a guidebook for the italy and spain parts of my trip. went to Barcelona, Cinque Terre and Rome. The book saved my sanity with its directions . Generally good information. Prices were higher in some places as can be anticipated. Great guide to Roman Forum - or else i'd have no idea what i'd be looking at. I really liked the information on transportation connections. Some descriptions of locations didn't work but they were generally good. He should mention that you have to pay cover charges at restaurants at places in Spain and Italy for (as the waitpeople tell me) the bread and the table cloth. The more sophisticated French don't do this. Good on ya Rick Steves."
5,Read it twice,"As they say, don't judge a book by its cover. At first glance, this paperback book appears to be a lightweight study guide. Upon reading it, however, you will find it to contain a mountain of technical information. Every page offers so many relevant details that you will need to read it twice, just to absorb them all. Fortunately, it is not written in a dry, jargonistic manner. As the title implies, the scientific principles involved are simplified for easier digestion and application. This makes the information all the more useful. And although it is not a full-fledged textbook, a prospective reader will still benefit from having a basic knowledge of chemistry before opening this book, because it is not a kids' book either. Take some notes as you read, and you will find it be a real learning experience."
5,beginner soil science,"This book is great for somebody just starting out in soil science. It explains the basics of soil science very well. I would also recommend this book for anybody interested in learning more about the concepts behind agriculture. Although the entire book may not apply to agriculture, it is completely enriching non-the-less!"
3,Soil Science Simplified,"The book was for a soil science class I was taking. The text seems to be translated from another language, as the sentence structure is very difficult in many places. This is a ""beginner's"" text, and as such was useful."
3,OK book mostly pirate stories.,"Seemed pretty factual, it was well written, just not my favorite genre of stories. I was hoping for old west stories. Good for a free read though."
3,Old tales compiled into one book and re-printed,"It is hard for me to believe that the author wrote these stories. The prose and verbiage seem to be written in the 19th century. It seems to me that the author more likely collected the tales from out of copyright stories and assembled them into this one book. I bought this book in the Kindle edition and did not notice if the author made reference to the original printed sources. This would be my error. All of the above said, I found the stories interesting and well told. If you intend to buy this book to search for treasure, then pass on buying this book. The treasure locations described are vague at best. If you are seeking to learn more about the pirates, their background and legends, then this book is for you! Enjoy !"
4,"LOOKS GOOD, DOES THE JOB","Overall I am very happy with this screeen. It arrived very promptly, and was in fine condition. It is lightweight and reasonably sturdy. I bought it because my baby girl has her crib in my bedroom and I wanted to create a ""seperate space"" for her. This screen works perfectly for that. For naps and bedtime I put it around her crib, she has a bit more privacy and I can move about my room without fear of waking her. It also happens to match the ""cherry finish"" on her crib perfectly. Only bummer was about a week after we got it, my 2 yr old knocked it over and it crashed against the footboard of my bed. Now there is a slight crack in the wood on one of the panels and one of the hinges is tweaked/warped so it is not exactly indestructable. Also be prepared to pay almost as much in shipping as the screen costs though. Otherwise a fine product for the price."
4,very satisfied with the screen,"The quality of this screen is better than I thought. The construction is not very solid but OK. It looks nice in my apartment, at least from a distance. You can find a few obvious joints and misaligned hinges if you look closely, but you can not ask too more for its price. The shipping/delivery is super fast. I am satisfied with this purchase."
4,Saw one for twice the price at the mall,"I am very happy with this tall 4-panel shoji screen I purchased to help provide privacy for a house guest staying in my bonus room. I was at a local shopping mall yesterday and saw a 3-panel one of what appeared to be the same material for $79.99. I purchased mine for about $40 and then paid $19.95 shipping - and mine is 25% wider than the one at the store. It arrived in perfect condition and all of the hinges were fine, and so was the paper/cloth in the frame. I am a happy customer!"
4,Excellent product for price,"Product was received in excellent condition and quickly. I was concerned about the smell that was mentioned in a prior review as I too am very sensitive to smells. Thankfully, there was not an odor to the product unless I stood with my nose just about to it. The screen does provide the privacy I needed for a home office."
4,Better than expected but not great,They are inexpensive so 5 stars on price.Packaging and shipping wash 5 stars.Quality 4 stars.These are not high end products and are obviously fragile.They are semi translucent when back is lit.Overall very happy with them.
4,nice,"This is a very nice screen. Workmanship is fine and the wood has an authentic cherry or rosewood look to it. The only negative for me is the faux rice paper, which doesn't seem very sturdy so who knows how long it will last before becoming torn."
5,Love them. Great deal,The panels can fold two-ways...thats pretty nice. I really like these. I used two of them to enclose my small dining room. I used some small anged brackets to set them in place to the floor and also installed a small. black cabinet door pull to make sort of a bi-fold door. They worked out great and they are good quality. They loook awesome with some light behind them
2,Flimsy,Now I know why it was so inexpensive. Does the job but often it falls over. Not sturdy AT ALL. Warped wood in places and cheap hinges. I would not recommend this product.
3,Nice but lack of attention to details,"Overall, the product looks nice, although the thinest pieces of wood making the ""net"" are not sanded and quite rough. The synthetic white material is well glued, without stains. The screen was well packed, with additional protection and was delivered without damage.The downsides : some hinges are not properly aligned, making the long pieces of wood to bend slightly. After two month of dry atmosphere in the apartment, the morteses of the structure are a bit loose. What is more of a concern to me is the smell of the product, off-gasing of the varnish I guess. Not strong, but still noticeable after two months."
5,Awesome,I bought these for my Mom to separate her living area and make better use out of the space and she just loves them!
3,It wasn't the best action figure,When I got this set in the mail I was very disappointed. I noticed that his joints were NOT ball hinges but joints that mainly just go up and down which I found made it harder to play with. If I were to choose anybody though I would most likely recommend this toy to collectors or people that like older toys.
4,Wonderful,This was the first time I purchased a used toy on the net and I must say it wont be the last. My son loves this action figure and for the price I think it was more than worth it.
4,"Well done, lots of information not found anywhere else","This is a well-researched book that goes into much more (and better) detail than I expected when I purchased it. I had already read quite a bit about Fenway, the old Huntington Avenue Grounds and the old South End Grounds, but this book added some very interesting pieces of trivia. The author also covers ""forgotten"" ballparks and arenas, which were very interesting and new for even an ""expert"" like me. ;)The only thing I felt the book lacks is more pictures and photos, especially of the parks and arenas that are now just memories, but that could be more due to lack of information than to a decision not to include them. Overall, I highly recommend this book for any Red Sox, Bruins, Celtics, Patriots or general sports history buff."
4,"Great grill, but high price","My parents purchased this grill recently, and the convenience of the gas ignition counters the argument of first-to-cook from the gas grill crowd. Also, nothing beats the look of the stainless steel surfaces on the cart when you're aiming to combine good looks and great cooking.The inaugural meal was a ham cooked with the optional rotisserie attachment. The coals (natural wood charcoal, of course) were ready very quickly, and the indirect cooking method kept the ham juicy and flavorful. The thermometer in the lid was great for knowing when to add coals or adjust the vents to maintain the temperature without having to constantly lift the lid and lose the heat.After helping prepare the meal and tasting the food afterwards, I was sold. However, the. . . price tag was too high for my wallet, so I purchased the Weber One-Touch Platinum, which was $200 less. . . this would be a 5-star product, but the high price knocks it down a notch."
4,Only one problem with the Weber,The ignition system on the Peformer is really worth the extra $$. We use our grill a couple of times a week - it really gets HOT (the thermometer won't even measure the temp - somewhere around 800-degrees!) so you can sear steaks just like the restaurants do. We use the natural mesquite wood. Only problem with the BBQ is that it has gotten so hot the plastic knobs on the top vent melted off and all over the top of the BBQ. They could have designed that part better.
5,Weber Performer - long duration experience,"I purchased a non-gas-ignition Weber Performer in 1992 and have used it 5 times per week, on average, since then. I LOVE this grill and my wife likes it even better, I think. About the only things we cook in the over now are Osso Bucco, Lamb Shanks, and one or two other dishes that need long, slow, low-temp cooking.My ash catcher/one touch cleaning system is starting to fail. Heck, the ash pail fell part-way off a few weeks ago and I had to fiddle with it to get it back on. I'll be contacting Weber to see if it's replaceable at this point (the thumbscrew is sheared off).Anyway, I really like the idea of gas ignition. The lighter fluid smell is my wife's biggest complaint. My question to you long-time users (over a year at least): how does the gas ignition system stand up to repeated use? Do ashes clog it? Does it light charcoal in the side baskets (I only do indirect cooking, even steaks)? Your input will be greatly appreciated."
4,Best of Both WorldS,"Now that I've got this working I can't imagine grilling on anything else. Assembling the grill was time consuming (~ 2 hours) and I got a bad gas tank, which resulted in a public-utility-like experience with Weber customer service. Halfway through the experience I vowed to never buy another Weber product again.The grill itself is awesome to behold. I definitely feel like the rich kid who's got awesome high tops but doesn't play too well whenever I burn the chicken. Getting a great set of coals going is simple. Weber did a great job designing the performer to be easy to use. It's the little things like the way the lid slide back into the holster and the grill has flaps to replenish the coals that make the performer awesome.I'm sure you'll enjoy."
5,"Cooking without ""Jet Fuel""","I don't know why it has taken us 30 years to realize the improved flavor food has that is cooked on a charcoal grill without using lighter fluid.We purchased the Weber gas-start charcoal grill and love it. It takes less time for the coals to get hot for cooking and all you taste is the great flavor of the meat and the smoke.Don't hesitate to pick up one of these grills, and you will never cook anyother way again."
4,Gray Magic = Steel Magic,"This story was also printed as ""Steel Magic"" (in ""The Magic Books"" ISBN 0-451-16638-8. It is an excellent juvenile (but I still like it at 64). See the earlier review by J Hamm for the story line. It is vintage Norton fantasy, though the mixture of characters from various legend lines is a bit much."
5,Jesse can do it all!,"Bending or breaking the rules doesn't always guarantee the creation of great music, but in this case the ""bending"" has made the music soar. Two great artist traded energy and licks to produce a cd of diverse music. Each piece has just the arrangements of mandolin and fiddle. From the speed demon ""Blowin' up a Strong"" to a standard that I thought I would not want to hear again, until now, ""Sweet Georgia Brown.""I saw Jesse and the Virginia Boys recently, at Fort Bledsoe Bluegrass Festival, playing at 9:30 of a cold, cold night, but his hot playing, found on this cd, heated audience! Highly recommended!"
5,This is the BEST Water or Feed Bowl you will find..,"I am a licensed kennel. I have searched high and low for a heavy... sturdy water bowl. These are the best. I own all that is available on the market. They do not compare to these. These are heavy and cannot be tipped over or chewed up. They clean easily..... I LOVE THEM....They are a great price too..... I would pay double for sure. THANKS, Sherlyn"
5,An unpretentious album that grows on you the more you listen,"This is a collection of melodies that really grows on you the more you listen. These songs are somewhat different from the typical CSNY fare you might have. The songs are 'soft rock' but have an almost jazzy quality sometimes. The mixing sometimes leaves a little to be desired in that volume levels aren't always consistent. But while it doesn't have the same well-polished finish that a lot of other albums have, there is a real 'honest' quality to the music. It is difficult to describe the genre, as it ranges from kinda-country to serious-rock, to a harmonic vocalization in the truly haunting title track. And a number of the songs do cover a range of social issues. If you like most of CSNY's stuff, this is a must-have!"
3,THIS 2008 UK RELEASE HAS SAME 2000 REMASTER,"The text above is worded to imply that this 2008UK releasefrom Troubador Records states this CD is newly remastered. This is not true. The master utilized for this release is the same U.S. remaster released in 2000 on MCA.The cardboard LP-sleeve provided by the label is the same size as all Japan mini-sleeves. However, the images of both sides of the 'sleeve are darker than the original artwork, with a sizeable loss of photographic detail.There is a genuine Japan mini-sleeve of this title, also released in '08, that has artwork more faithful to the original release, but unfortunately, it is not available on Amzon."
5,Wind on the Water,"This is one of my favorite songs, together with the 2 songs which are a prelude to Wind on the Water. Everyone should listen. It takes me to a better place."
4,Worth Buying For Title Song Alone,"Would you be happy with three or four good songs, five or six forgettable ones, and one that's off the scale? Then consider buying this album.Among the good songs are Carry Me, Bittersweet, Love Work Out, and maybe Take the Money and Run.The title song, however, is miles beyond the rest of the album. It's hard to even think of anything CSN&Y did that compares with it. Somehow they have risen above themselves to produce a beautiful yet tragic piece (it doesn't feel right to call it a ""song"") which juxtaposes the beauty and freedom of being a whale with the tragedy of their slaughter. I can't listen to it without tears. Without this song the CD would deserve 2.5 or maybe 3 stars. With it, it's a four-star CD. I would have been happy if it had nothing but the title song."
5,Time Has Been Good To This Music,"I bought this LP the day it came out. I saw the tour and even took some very good pictures of this time in David and Graham's career. They played Moody Colliseum on the SMU campus in Dallas. Compared to some of their later work this album stood the test of time. With Russ Kunkell on drums, Leland Skylar on bass and all assorted guests these guys laid down some tremendous songs and soaring harmonies. To The Last Whale made me mad and sad at the same time. I mean killing whales for eyemake-up. If you have ever been on the water in a boat next to one of these gentle giants the song hits home. The guys in this backup band were the most sought after session men in L.A. for years. They were tight. Once again I lived this album. I put it on cassette the day I got it and I know every song by heart. I can't help it. I love these guys. These musicians both influenced my songwriting and my desire to seek music as a career. This album moved me very much."
1,PLEASE!,"i bought this CD because it had all my fave fred hammond songs on it. but little did i know that they are all, ALL bad versions of them! you can't even sing along! this CD sucks! DO NOT BUY THIS CD!"
5,Glorious,"A spectacular CD with remastered studio versions of some of Fred Hammond's best songs. It's a great CD, you cannot go wrong with this one.My favorite is the remastered studio version of ""We're Blessed"". This alone makes the entire CD worth it. But there are 13 other songs on this CD that are #1's in my book.""When The Spirit of the Lord"" has a new hot intro. ""No Weapon"" sounds really great in the studio. ""Let the Praise Begin"" is exceptional.""You Are The Living Word"" and ""Please Don't Pass Me By"" are some of the album's sweetest and most intimate worship songs.This is a brilliant CD. I praise the Lord for this music. May Fred Hammond continue from glory to glory."
2,Wine-Opoly Game Board,"This product ...game board tokens, cards, were overall of extremely cheap & poor quality, I was disgusted with how flimsy & sub-standard everything was."
5,A Gift,A Christmas gift and one that my son and daughter-in-law love. They enjoy wine thus the reason for the gift.
2,"compact, but low sensitivity","The product is not bad and I like the fact that it can be used in either camera orientation. It seems well made and the finish was good. The fluid used is quite viscous and creates a significant damping effect on the small bubble, for better or worse. The significant flaw of the device is that it has very low sensitivity to tilt. By the time the bubble is noticably off center, the camera is tilted enough to be obviously visible without the level. While I haven't thrown it away, I don't find a lot of use for it."
1,A Waste of Resources,"Other reviewers have expressed eloquently the reasons Ono's records should never have been released to begin with, so I will simply add this: If anyone ever deserved a boxed set less than Yoko Ono did, I cannot think who it might be."
1,One question,"You only need to ask yourself one question. Had Yoko Ono not been married to John Lennon, would any of this ever have seen the light of day? Maybe one other....what does it tell you when a 5 CD box set hits the bargain bins?"
5,Great Show of Metamorphosis (Ono-Lennon),"Yoko was an artist by herself,but Lennon brought out the best in her!This compilation shows her from the start,and the changes she went as years passed by.Great Metamorphosis Ono-Lennon-Lennon-Ono!"
5,Wow... mesmerizing... brilliant...,"I have had the box set since before it was officially released. I still listen to it all the time. I go through phases of preferring one over the rest... I constantly lend them out because I want others to be turned on to this... BUT, I somehow did not get my copy of Run,Run,Run back and so.... if anyone has an extra copy of that particular CD... PLEASE let me know....!"
1,Dissapointing,I did not like this album at all. Yoko should not try to sing. She sounds like a whistle. The only thing she should do is promote John's work and leave the music for the people that know how to sing. Some people should not go near a microphone and Yoko is one of them.
5,Yoko Ono - The Mother of Alternative,"Where would artists like Kate Bush, Bjork, the B-52s, and so many more be without Yoko having been there first? Answer: nowhere. And artists like Alanis Morisette, Fiona Appel and Meredith Brooks could take a lesson page from Yoko's book of artistic angst.A consummate artist, innovator, humanitarian and social commentator. A beautiful human being. And probably a big part of the reason why John Lennon became the John Lennon whose passing we mourn."
5,"I used it for 2,000 sqft floor","very easy to install and use. Not many failed ones if the stapler is used properly. In times I have to remove it, best way is to cut open and pulled out with the cutter!"
4,One touch Kettle,"I have used Weber Kettles since 1981. There were several changes made to the model I just purchased, two of which I am uncertain. 1. The new handles absorb heat too quickly. After about an hour, the hands require some type of protection from the hot handles. 2. The grilling surface is made of a smaller gauge wire and I am not certain if I will get my usual 7-8 years service from it."
3,Clancy's are better live,My grandfather had an eight track of the Clancy Brothers performing a live concert. It made this hillbilly wish he was Irish. I have to say that the studio recordings on Greatest Hits loose a lot of the ebergy from that eight track.
3,Nice posable Optimus Prime,"This Optimus Prime model by Revoltech is pretty cool. It's made with special ball-like joints for creating dynamic poses and comes with some swappable accessories. The painting is poor and there are visible molding lines, but it's a fun cheap model to keep on your desk."
5,LOVE IT,"Wehn growing up Transformer's was the best out there next to GI JOE. I know all you, ""I Love the 80's people."" I am very pleased with this purchase and recommend anyone that has been a TF fan to get one. Brings back memories!!!"
5,A must for Op fans,I've loved Optimus Prime since I was seven. This super poseable figure lets me put him in the awesome action poses I've always wanted but could never get from the real toys.
2,Not worth the cost.,"I love the Transformers...and Optimus Prime has always been my favorite Autobot.So when I found the revoltech figures I was really excited. But after receiving him in the mail...I must say that I am really disappointed.For the current price listing (49.75 USD), I have to say this figure isn't worth it just because of its size. Yes it is very articulated and heavily detailed as the description states. But the figure stands much shorter than even the McFarlane Halo 3 Master Chief figures.If you need them....get Megatron or Starscream first. They are much cheaper and you can see the size for yourself. From that you'll see Prime is not worth the extra cost.I love Prime...but I would have been better off getting a full statue or one of the original toys.Transformers: Cybertron Commander Optimus Prime Convoy Revoltech Action Figure"
2,Boring,"For me, the book just doesn't flow comfortably. It seems to be a curious mix of triviality and abstruseness. It's not an academic kind of book, but somehow it reminds me of all the boring English teachers I had in school. Maybe it's the small type and compactness. Perhaps it's the bland layout of the text. The contents are accurate enough, but the tutorial explanations seem ---ironically --- ponderously written and the exercises are really boring. It's cheap enough, I suppose, and if one's writing is in desperate need of help, it might be useful to buy it. Truly though, ""thirty minutes a day"" might be me more time than one is willing to put into it. Don't even consider buying it for a normal teen or preteen. An adult might better tolerate its boring format. There are probably other, equally inexpensive, sentence writing books that are more interesting."
3,Useful but Not Comprehensive,"Better Sentence Writing in 30 Minutes a Day has a lot of good information about grammar, and it is presented in a easy to understand way. However, the book does not get far into the art of composing or revising sentences."
5,Outstanding!,"The mix of Don Williams bass and Susan Taylor's angelic vocals is a match made in heaven. I bought the LP ""Time"" back in 1965 without ever having heard of the group. The picture of a sultry Susan Taylor on the cover and a nice selection of standard 60s folk tunes in the track listing was more than enough for me. Every song on that ""Time"" LP turned out to be a knockout. When this became available on CD I jumped at the chance to buy and discovered a new gem as a bonus track, ""I Believed It All"", a beautifully sung ode to the the innocence of childhood.Williams of course went on to bigger and better things in a C&W vein but unfortunately Susan Taylor seems to have faded into obscurity. In any case, this CD would definitely be in my ""stranded on a desert isle"" backpack."
4,Pozo-Seco Singers/Eric Clapton,"I,too, recall listening and buying Pozo-Seco Singers 45 ""Time""in the San Francisco Bay Area where I grew up. Apparently Pozo-Seco were only a hit in the LA/SF area most likely because of the influence of Drake Radio i.e. KHJ/KFRC.What is most interesting is that Don Williams,the tenor of Pozo-Seco, went on to become Don Williams, a HUGE Country star and the biggest influence to Eric Clapton since Muddy Waters. Listen, It's true... Clapton in the late 70s early 80's was really Don Williams. ""Livin' on Tulsa Time"", ""Wonderful Tonight"":. etc.. Clapton was either Williams or J.J. Cale.Oh yeah... this is a great 60's era folk album..."
5,time,i was excited that they finally put out these albums on cd.at least i can listen to them sing again .i only wish they would put out the last album when only don & susan where left in the group . the album was called shadows & light . i have this one album& it is excellant.
5,Beloved album found!,"My mother bought the second part of this in 1969, and I confiscated it and played the LP until I wore out the grooves on the LP especially over ""Mary Jenkins"" and ""Johnny,"" among the two most huanting ballads I've ever heard. I second MojoDJ -- this is one of the few albums that hasn't got a single bad song on it.I didn't even think to search for it until Christmas Eve night, and I am so happy to find it again after almost 30 years. Though my partner is about tired of hearing ""Mary Jenkins."" ;)"
4,Great deal...,"I like this holster a lot. It looks nice...The leather isn't cheap...and it protects my phone. For the price...it's a really great deal. My only complaint would be that it's a little bulkier than I would like. With the belt clip, it protrudes out at twice the depth of the actual phone. But overall, a great holster."
1,product won't work and it's to old to get troubleshooting help from the company,"My computer runs on windows Vista. When I purchased this product the start up disk would not work, and when I went to the companies website to get assistance with troubleshooting it stated that the product was to old of a version to get technical help. It did have some things posted that I tried but none of them worked."
3,nice concept but could use some work,"I loved the idea of these things but I knew they were too good to be true. The first weekend I used them and the waters got rough overnight, I came back the next day to see one of the buckles snapped & hanging off the post. My main problem with these is that there is no locking feed to keep the straps in their position. I wound up tying the slack of each strap to each other just to keep them from drooping. I am going to drill these into the posts to make sure I don't come back one morning and see them floating 100ft away."
5,repositionable protection,"I bought 3 of these bumpers thinking I'd have to cut off the straps and screw them in, but after seeing how well the straps held I decided to rethink permanent installation. I have a 20' ""cuddycabin"" type boat, the bumpers work quite well and if tightened firmly, they don't move around. By keeping them portable I'll be able to redistribute the wear evenly between them and store them away easier. Other considerations are that in time of extreme tidal shift you can adjust their position, and you can take them with you on the boat if needed. I think this product is well made and offers good protection for small to mid-size boats(say >32'appox.)"
2,Pretty but clunky,"The first pair of these I purchased, the teeth kept getting stuck on each other. I received a replacement quickly, but that pair wasn't great either. With this type of thinning shear, you get what you pay for. So go for the more expensive pairs is what I recommend. I bought a pair that was half the size for about $40 and it works beautifully."
2,"Ok, but found wanting.","Chan presents some good things to think about but what he offers is more questions than answers. Not enuf meat here for me; I agree with him that the church needs to get a lot more sensitive to the Holy Spirits guidance however he did not provide many suggestions or dwell on much Scripture. I guess if you would like to watch a girl tear wallpaper off a wall and have sheets of paper swirl around her then get this DVD but otherwise I think there are better ways to advance your obedience to Christ. Frankly, I wish I could get my $$ back!"
3,I mis-read the label,"I ordered this in a hurry thinking it was regular lobellia tincture like the Dr Schulze lung formula. When it arrived I realiSed it was homeopathic. Come to think of it that should have been a good thing since I could have kept adding vodka to it and shaking it up to make it last forever, but I got really sick and downed the whole bottle. I use other homeopathic products but for an herb as naturally potent as lobelia, I would really have preferred to buy the regular lobelia herb tincture as it is very strong on its own. I found the homeopathic one a bit too dilute for my needs. It did not help me much.(Long-term asthma and pulmonary ascariasis.) I would not purchase again."
4,Iraq and the Middle East,"This is not written as a history of the Iraq War. In this book, the author provides information and background on the politics, culture and religions of Iraq and the Middle East. The author describes his own experiences in Iraq and the people he met as a framework describing the personalities and factions who are affecting the history and current war in Iraq. The author provides enlightening information, but this is not a history of the war or a comprehensive history of Iraq. I enjoyed reading it, and learned much about important personalities and Shia and Sunni attitudes, but was somewhat disappointed by a lack of current information on the war."
2,"A travellers journal, only for the intensely bored or ignorant",It's become a little tedious this slew of writings from inside the Green Zone and while I'd hoped for particular insights from this author they were absent. Perhaps the author has spent so much time in the USA that he has lost the capacity to emphathise and a teacher's desire to inform this reads like a rather dull travel journal and did the least of any recent books to inform me about the tragedy of a wasted war and a conflict rooted in fear and ignorance rather than common sense.
1,Need knowledge of people & place for this one,"Oops, I thought I was reviewing the seller. The book is a dry read. It is written from the perspective of someone who knows all the people and the places over there. To read this and get something out of it, one needs extensive background knowledge of the situation and the people involved. I found it very difficult to read. Not real crazy about it at all."
4,What else are you going to buy?,"For general purpose cutting these are the choice. They do well in a variety of non-abrasive materials. Just don't push them hard or you will need another 5 pack right away. The bits do better if you just let the tool do the work. They are kind of hard to control if you want a nice cut. But that's the nature of spiral saws . The down cutting spiral is nice since the dust is blown away from you instead of back at your face. It's pretty simple , if you have a spiral saw , you need these bits."
3,not very long lasting - burns up fast,these bits do not last long. burns up or break after only a couple of hours of use on pine and plywood. am looking for other brand bits for prolonged use.
1,ARE YOU SERIOUS???,This has to be the WORST written book I have ever read in my entire life. It has no detailed description of the characters in it which leads you to believe that the author didn't care about his fellow Marine's. The flow of writing and vocabulary is that of an elementary school kid. Don't get me wrong as I am grateful for his service. But if he'd shot as many soldier's as he took day's off and as many beer's as he'd drank than he'd for sure be in the record books. There are several contradictions in the book and even more events that leave the reader baffled as to what point the author was trying to make. The fact that so many people gave it good ratings is a miracle. But the fact it was published has to be the miracle of the century!!
2,"Not the best, save it for the end of the list.","This is the least interesting of all the Viet Nam sniper books out there. I also think it's mostly a work of fiction. Not one person in the book has an actual name. Instead everyone is known by some stupid nickname (which of course makes the author's story hard to verify, now doesn't it). Even the photos are nameless. I recommend reading the other more popular sniper books first, and then if you haven't got your fill read this one."
2,not much to like,actually pretty boring after you have read about what his boot camp and sniper training were like. good to see he turned his like around after Vietnam.
2,Action but poor character!,"Dead Center: Lots of action. You don't want to put it down--EXCEPT--it is full of cuss words. The language got so BAD that with less than a chapter to go, I tossed it in the trash. I do not recommend this book or authur. I like war stories and understand reality but this is not needed. -Ron."
3,Not the best/Not the worst,"I have read probably 100 books on The Vietnam War and as far as an over all rating; three stars is about as high as I can go. There simply was not enough about the war and too much about sleeping etc, Also a new perspective was described in this book, that is how locked in with the boots and the command structure the snipers seemed to be. Other books of this period showed a lot more independence on the part of the snipers. It is an OK book, but this would not be my first selection if I was going to read about the era."
2,Not that great,"I have to disagree with most everyone here. I was disappointed that there were very few stories that were directly related to sniping. It was an all right book, meaning he did tell his story of what he did during his tour in Veitnam, but not that much seemed to be related to sniping. Joseph T. Wards book ""Dear Mom"" was much better. As far as the launguage in the book, I was extremely disappointed. For a person who thinks he is saved and claims Jesus Christ as his Savior, his launguage proves him otherwise. Don't buy this book if you want stories on sniping. But buy this book if it is ""cool"" to you if someone cusses. I would say ""grow up""."
1,not worth it,"i put this book down half way through it. snipers save several lives by the taking of one enemy life. this proffesion is often looked down on by outsiders mainly because of people like this author. by the time i reached half way through this book he seemed to have no respect for life or for god. maybe he did by the end but it wasn't worth finishing. if you want a good book that centers more on the art of sniping, try marine sniper by Charles Henderson"
2,Whatever,"Hard to keep interest, rambled back and forth to much, did read the whole book. Sorry but would not buy another by this author."
3,Not so intense marine action,"Let's be honest: if you want a high-intense marine sniper action, you have to buy ""Marine Sniper, 93 Confirmed Kills"". Dead Center is more about the life of a marine sniper on Vietnam based on a every-day point of view. Sometimes the book tells you how boring was life on the camp. However, this doesn't mean the book is not helpful and entertaining. If you want to know how a marine lived on Vietnam, read this book but, if you want to read exciting stories about impossible sniper missions and crude enemy infiltration operations, you should try ""Marine Sniper, 93 Confirmed Kills"".Now, about the book, its very funny to learn how the snipers made life on war fun, and how they killed boreness with certain games that we may call stupid. Besides, we get to know the impact of war on people's behavior, and how the sniper, because of being sniper, was more vulnerable to severe behavior changes after some time on war. The story about sniper missions are not very exciting."
4,The Vietnam Experience,"Fascinating book.Some of the other reviews suggest that this book is exciting, and others suggest that it is boring. It is really both, and that is why Dead Center is such a good book. By telling his story so honestly, Ed Kugler helps us to understand a little more about what it was like for young men to train and fight in the Vietnam war. Part of their time was spent in boredom and loneliness. The rest of their time was spent surrounded by fear, combat, and death.This book would not make a good Hollywood script. The Marines described within are not glamourous and witty, and they did not always make smart choices. Again, that is why this is a good book. It really describes what happens when you hand a bunch of very young men rifles and throw them into a war like Vietnam. By reading this book, I gained a deeper understanding of the experience of war, and gained a deeper appreciation for our veterans. Thank you for sharing your story, Mr. Kugler, and thank you for your service."
2,Uch...,"I'm going to be quite frank with you, it smelt awful. If I was to compare it to something, I'd say a mixture of nursing home, men's locker room, alcohol, and a very VERY faint scent of flowers."
3,nice but some reservations,"This item is very easily assembled,installed and looks nice on my Nissan Xterra. My only concern is it's durability since it's completely constructed of some type of plastic. I'd give it 5 stars if some of it was metal. The product description doesn't fit this product...shame on you Amazon. Go Gators!"
4,Not a kids book,"This is a beautiful book with beautiful stories but I would move it up to the 20+ reading group. I am still baffled about their definition of ""fully illustrated"". Sixty sketched, black and white, illustrations in 803 pages does not constitute ""fully""."
1,Andersen deserves better,"It is just sad that publishers like this one are opportunistic and know that just because Andersen is on the cover the book will sell. The translations are rickety and unreadable. And the quality of the book is disappointing. I immediately resold mine and bought another, far superior, volume. Don't get taken for a ride."
2,Mediocre Quality,"This is a decent collection of tales. All the popular stories are included; however, there are some tales that didn't make much sense.Readability is average. I wouldn't recommend giving this book to a child to read. As for a parent reading this book to his/her child, the overuse of colons, semi-colons, and commas can make for difficult story telling.Overall, if you're looking for a good collection of tales by Hans Christian Andersen either just to keep or to read to your child, you may want to pass on this book."
4,Fairy Tales,"I bought this book and must admit to not paying attention to the typeset or quality of the paper. It didn't matter to me because I was still being transported away with the memories of the wonderful fairy tales from my childhood.The book still serves its purpose, the tales are as wonderful and magical as I remember them, and I look forward to reading them out loud to my grandchildren. Better still, the format will still see them enjoying it in their adulthood as it does me.It is good to see these stories have been kept alive and well preserved.For the price, its been well worth it for me."
1,Disappointment.,"I own the paperback copy of the book illustrated and love it. The inside contents of the e-book, however, were not the same version of the stories."
5,Church & praise & worship,Get your praise on! Just play at the house and get your praise on and poppin. To God be all the glory.
5,Sony CD-RW,"Formatted all 10 Sony CD-RW's without any trouble. Bought 10 Memorex CD-RW's, 3 wouldn't format, didn't care. Now I know where to buy now. Thank You. John R. All"
1,Broke apart after first use,This is a cool concept I must say where you have a ball head for a flash. I got the idea from Bob Krist and Joe Mcnally from thier CLS video.The item looked good and also looked quite sturdy but it broke apart after i used it for the first time. (quite unfortunate). The real bummer is that my SB-600 fell to the ground and now it has a nice crack on its side.I later found out that the steel cold shoe was dislocated from the flash mount. I found the cold shoe stuck to the bottom of my flash on the ground.If you like the idea I would recommend a different setup. Giotto MH1004 (ball head) with Stroboframe Bracket Cold Shoe Mount. Very sold setup (double the price though)!.
4,"The early days of Univac, Control Data, and Cray.","Lots of first person inside information about the early days of commercial mainframe computers. The story covers Univac, Control Data Corporation (CDC) and Cray. The author tells how disenchanted Univac employees founded CDC and then later how Cray was founded when CDC managed to offend their lead designer Seymore Cray, whom they had lured away from Univac. The strange and incestuous relationships of the three companies is covered from an insider's point of view. The author reveals what a hotbed of computer development the Twin Cities (St. Paul and Minneapolis Minnesota) was in the '60s and '70s. It also has some absolutely fascinating information about Seymore Cray. Any serious student of computer history should have this book."
3,Lacks Detail and Poorly Organized,"This book is obviously derived from the factory Ford manuals, but in an effort to condense the information into a smaller book, the publishers left a lot out, crammed it all together with smallish type and poorly reproduced illustrations, and made it difficult to read. Overall it's a poor substitute for the OE manual. I do find it useful as a companion to the factory manuals, however. I can take this one out into the barn, use it as a quick reference for procedures I have already reviewed at length in the more detailed factory manual, not worrying if I smear grease on it. That fact, combined with it's relatively low cost (especially compared to the factory manual) allows me to give it a higher score than I think it really deserves. If you are thinking of this as a stand-alone manual, I'd give it only two stars and recommend finding an original Ford manual."
2,Not good,Bought it in Sep 2002. It has been very disappointing. THe keys falling apart. The cd drive door broke. Keys getting stuck etc. Was not at all happy with the model.
1,Pricey and not worth it,"its pretty pricey at the price, and 2nd is the ram they give you is maxed out meaning 512 is the maximum ram it can handle in total. the processor itself is stuck on 1.6 meaning it cannot go any higher or lower then the 1.6ghz they provided, its a pretty dissapointing thing in total so my rating is very poor since the fixed processor means that if you short it out its VERY pricey to replace"
3,Decent Short Read,"From back cover:SKIN TO SKIN...Tonya Griffin had been a lovestruck assistant when she had thrown herself at her boss. Twelve years later, Web Tyler was making the now-famous photographer a lucrative offer. Tonya had dreamed of this moment for years, but her revenge had soured: Web Tyler had forgotten their night together!Web had come to Tonya's remote cabin hideaway to convince her to sign his contract, but the close-quarters' contact made keeping his mind on business impossible. Her scent drove him wild, her touch made him shiver and he was desperate to test the springs on her creaky iron bed. He'd never met so tempting a woman...so why was there regret in her eyes?--------------This was a decent read, neither great nor awful. Perfect if you're in the mood for something light!"
1,Bostitch Staples,"I received 2 shipments of staples. First order was not packaged properly and all staples were loosely packaged. Staples I received in first shipment was broken up. Individual section had been seperatedin 4 to 12 staples. Utilized what was intact awaiting second shipment. This shipment was properly packaged with all staples in tack. These worked Great. When I inserted loose staples 4 to 6 staples, I experienced jams and discontinued use of first shipment."
2,Packaging is definitely a problem,When I opened the box of staples I was shocked to find that the staples were literally thrown into the box with nothing securing them in any way. The staples were bent and broken apart from each other making them totally unusable. I can't vouch for the staple performance because I returned the box as soon as I received it. Harbor Freight has the same staples for less than half the price (and the packaging was adequate).
1,Beware!!,"Poor packaging. Someone apparently dropped and box the staples were in and it had broken open and scattered the staples throughout the Amazon box. In addition, these staples are not coated with adhesive as are the Bostitch staples. I had to return them and ordered the Bostitch staples. Now I have to wait for a March 3 ship date."
5,Hinges worked perfectly,"I needed to replace a few of our kitchen cabinet door hinges because of wear and tear (my cabinets are 20 years old). Some of the doors were uneven and another continually would fall half way out when opened. I had no luck finding replacements at the big box stores and resorted to searching on line, I was extremely happy to find exactly what I needed. I thought that I would be receiving 3 hinges, but I was pleasantly surprised to instead receive 3 pair of hinges. As it turned out I needed 5 hinges so I was happy to have the extra hinges over what I thought I was ordering. The item description doesn't indicate that they are sold in pairs. Great product that has saved me many headaches of doors falling out or not closing properly."
5,Very Focused B2B Information,"In this thorough guide, authors Martin P. Block and Tamara S. Block delve into business to business marketing research, describing its component elements and explaining how to apply research techniques. They don't consistently discuss research in the context of the marketing department, so you should probably have an idea of how research fits into your strategy before you open this book. Still, its narrow focus and intense expertise makes it appealing and valuable, if academically written. Block and Block describe how to manage research and find information. They explain how to use customer databases, analytical tools, survey techniques and financial values. This book is not light reading, but we recommend it to anyone interested in or working with marketing research."
5,Homeless -- a must read,"I recently picked ""Homeless: Portraits of Americans in hard times"" on ebay and it has knocked my socks off.The portraits in the book are stark, shot against a black backdrop, with minimal posing. They are beautiful photographs --- ironically, since so many of us try to avoid eye contact when we encounter homeless people on the street, they make you want to look at homeless people -- and they are often accompanied, on the opposite page, by words from the subjects.Mr. Schatz took the time to talk to the homeless people in the book, to listen to their stories, and to photograph them as they are -- not as he, the photographer, wanted them to be seen. In my eyes, this helps them go from being a group of homeless to people to individuals. They all have stories and dreams and struggles, just like you and I."
4,Some great R+B and pop but maybe a little inconsistent,"I bought this CD purely on a whim, and I have to say a year later that it proved to be one of my better buys. Tracks like Hundred mile high city and The Riverboat Song are great up tempo songs that get me moving whilst Debris road and Get Blown Away are slower melodic tunes that really stir me. Yet as good as these and others are I still find it hard to listen through the ENTIRE album without finding some of the tracks a little disjointed and boring. Believe me I have tried many times but its not a ""hear-through to the end"" album. Good album but not up there with Mosely Shoals"
5,Perfect,This product is perfect. Your skin would be very smoothy after using it. This includes almost everything that you need to take care of your hands every week in winter.
5,Amazing,this cd makes most other cds look like crap it has a lot of hidden things in it and everytime you listen to it you find something new but the best way to put it is you will either love melt banana or hate them
4,Their most accessible record to date...,"I bought this CD after seeing them live on the ""Geek Tour"" opening for fellow weirdos, Fantomas. I was thinking the entire time ""They could never match their live performance; not even close!"", but I was definitely wrong. Obviously, nothing can top Melt-Banana's live performance. Even if you HATE their music, you have to be entertained by their live show. This is easily their most accessible/""radio-friendly"" record so far. I am excited to hear some new material, that's for sure. And to the dude who called them ""college rock""? Dude...I thought ""college rock"" was REM? You friggin' dummy."
5,A Viva Terlingua 20 yr reunion!,"If you have his Viva Terlingua CD, then this is a must! Live and just as relevant as that one was. Probably my two favorite ones............well you still need the Brown cover one from 1974-5................and then there's the new Moon Child.............................just get 'em ALL! Life is Short...............(also one of his titles) Go for it! !"
3,Jerry Jeff grows up but not quite old,"There is a common story shared by Jerry Jeff, Jimmy Buffett, and Hank Williams Jr.; youth and wildness, plus talent, will make you wealthy enough to settle back and rest on your laurels. The old fans will be there for you and still identify as they settle into their own new, peaceful lives. Viva Lukenbach is a 360 from the drunken beer joint jam of the electrifying Viva Terlingua; the ballads ring with wisdom rather than despair, and the uptempo numbers chug along like a freight train but never threaten to derail. It would be false to say that this record is exciting, but hey ... comforting is not such a bad thing to be. And when there are tunes as strong as ""Some Phone Numbers"" and ""I'll Be Here In the Morning,"" why quibble about a slower pace?"
5,Dry Wall Helper that Doesn't Complain,This is by far the best product for hanging dry wall I have ever seen. I only wish I had one 30 years ago. This product makes dry walling a breeze. And the best part is this helper doesn't complain.
5,One man job,"I used this to do my whole basement by myself. What a life saver. I could never have done it alone and even with the help of two other people at my disposle, which I didn't have, wouldn't have been as convenient as using this wonderful invention. With the ressesed cans for lighting in the basement I just cranked up a 4 by 8 by 1/2 inch thick sheet tight to the cans and used a rotozip with a bit designed to ride along the outside edge of the can or outlet box, and buzzed the wholes out then cranked the rock up the last inch and screwed it up tight."
1,horrible - read only if you seek to misunderstand,"This is painful. The other comments rating this low are spot-on. Assuming a deterministic paradigm is not outside science's normal workings, in fact as a pragmatic assumption it serves science the best. Recent exceptions in physics are not the rule, and are not appropriately extended metaphorically to the idea of ""uncaused causes"" that Skinner rallied against. As for the gentleman who accuses Skinner of starting with a conclusion, he clearly has not studied the inductive nature of Skinner's research very closely. This is yet another example of someone criticizing work that they clearly don't even understand."
1,URGH!!!!!,B.F. Skinner is the greatest scientist of our time. The author doesn't like his conclusions so rejects him. Just like when people couldn't accept the earth revolved the sun people always villify what they don't understand. This is more than pathetic. the author is an embarrassment to science. Please buy books by B.F. Skinner. He is not afraid to reveal the truth through true science.
2,So so,"I bought this CD based on a recommendation. It is a little boring. I know, I know, it is a preparation for meditation. It's not very inspiring."
5,This CD Single,This is an excellant CD Single and has some great remixes of the song. I hope this has encourged you to buy this albun it is great.
3,"Nothing much, but a lot of it.","The sheer mass of material on this disc propels it out of the generic rock wasteland. Musically and vocally, I can't say much more for it, though. It doesn't inspire much criticism either way."
4,Besides...,Does anyone know what the picture is on the cover of the album?I've always wondered and cant find an answer...
4,excellent product,I needed this for building guitars. It was recommended for installing end jacks. Delivery was prompt and the price good.
2,Ellroy,"A very unusual crime novel, with the plot all in the last 10 pages, using typical Ellroy news headlines we saw in LA Confidential. A study of the criminal subculture that 99% of the population will never come across unless they are robbed or murdered. For those of faint hearts, or otherwise normal, this is very pornographic, sick and violent."
3,Not too exciting,"The 3 D could of been a little more interesting & so could the whole movie, but just have to buy stuff in 3D"
3,"Fun, What The Heck","Amusing computer generated flicker. These computer generated flickers, that are based on what we think we know of the past, tend to be thought provoking and worthy of viewing. The graphics motion gets better all the time.The script could stand a little more depth."
3,Dinosaurs: Giants of Patagonia,"For the kid in all of us that loves dinosaurs,the Giants of Patagonia is simply fun to watch with nice 3D effects."
1,Disc wont load !!!!!,I'm onto my 2nd copy and neither will loadI have a ps3 and 3d tvwhat the heck ?Can't review as I still haven't seen it
3,No action,"This is more a documentary than anything, no real action to it. Nothing thats going to keep a young childs interest."
2,Slow,I got this for my 3 year old. He loves dinosaurs. This disc was more talking and dig footage than animated dinos. He was not interested.
1,GHOST STORY,Ok the price was rite so why not buy it .What a mistake not only is there ghosting but triple images I am not depending on some of the so called big reviews on the internet been burned too many times.Save your money on this one it now ranks as the worse 3d movie I have Best Buy will not let you return for a refund so the grandkids will just have to watch it in 2d how lame is that.
4,It is about ok,As a documentary film it is ok. The 3D format could have been better. But still it can be recommended.
4,Movie script is so-so but great 3D effects,"Like many of these 3D documentaries, the movie script is a little dull, but this movie has the best 3D effects I've seen so far. One of the things that make the 3D effects so good is that the images are very sharp and the 3D separation is very good. Even the hairs on one of the dinosaurs backs was completely sharp in 3D. The Patagonia landscapes are also nice. This is a good way to try out your 3D TV if you just got one. I rented it on Blockbuster, but Amazon has a bigger selection of 3D movies."
3,Still waiting on a 4 star 3D Dino movie,"I've got 3 of the 3D Dino movies...I would say this ones's the best(with whats out there that ain't saying much).The flying Dino's are the best 3D part in my view.I'm into reptiles,interest started with Dino's,if you share the same interest,then it might be worth it.The 3D parts are ok,nothing special."
4,Dinosaurs recreated yet again,"Ever since Steven Speilberg created Jurassic Park, there has been an ongoing movement to create more realistic dinosaurs on film/dvd. This is the latest of the wave of dinosaur documentaries. I must admit to liking Donald Sutherland's narration. He probably did not write it, but he delivers the dialog with appropiate poignancy.I am not sure if this is the best rendition of the dinosaurs yet, but it was worth the price. My only complaint is it was too short.(under an hour)."
3,Slightly disappointing,"I bought this book, as I often do, on the basis of the gushing reviews. The quotes themselves are wide-ranging and varied, and do live up to their promise of motivation to a degree, maybe not to the extent promised by the author: ""Don't wait another day, achieve success TODAY!!!"".I would have preferred if the quotes were grouped into some sort of chapters or themes, rather than randomly listed. Shallow as it may seem, I found the layout and design quite unattractive, which matters to me in a book that you should want to handle often."
2,1001 Reasons To Get Another Book,"I love quotes. I waited 3 weeks for this book to arrive, anticipating ""great stuff from great minds."" When it finally arrived, I eagerly flipped through the pages and wondered what the heck I'd done. About the half the quotes are anonymous and uninspiring. Every other quote seems to be from Anthony Robbins. (So why didn't I just buy one of Robbins' books instead?) Many of the quotes are from the bible or some evangelist on TV. Hardly any quotes from women. This book was NOT what I thought it was. Oh, well. Like they say, ""Live and learn!"""
5,A wonderful book!,"It is a whimsical and enchanting book! My 3 1/2 year old daughter requests it every night. She has memorized all the rhymes, and it is a complete delight to listen to her sing along. Thank you Carly Simon for bringing such joy to our bedtime routine!"
1,What a waste!,"Not only is the accompanying tape only about 10 min in total length, but there are only about 10 rhymes in the whole book!I bought this for my nephew as a 'starter nursery rhyme' book. My SIL likes to sing, &thought; this would be good for all. After receiving,they were strangely silent about it. When I finally visited last wk, I was horrified to see how badly I'd been ripped off. I couldn't apologize enough.#1 - each little verse is sung only once.#2 - as mentioned, the tape looks like a joke. If it plays 5 whole min before it needs to be switched to other side, I'd be surprised.#3 - They could've at least made the book better, by putting each verse on it's own page w/picture, but no, it's a couple per page with one main graphic & tiny ones maybe for the other verses.Book is good for toddlers, with hard pages, but is so short, & the TAPE IS SO SHORT, that it is a total waste of time to even put in a cassette player.Was Carly desperate for a payck or did she just not care????"
3,Can't access controls with grip in place - Lumix G,"I gave this item three stars because it is touted (and marked on the package) as ""one size fits all"" If ""fits all"" means it can be installed on the camera, then that is accurate. If ""fits all"" means it allows you to access the controls, then not so much. I tried lots of different strap lengths and several different hand-holds and couldn't find a way to reach the rear dial or the four-way controls on the camera back. In addition, the grip's base has a locator tab which interferes with the complete closing of the display.The grip seems well made, but it is not suitable for the Lumix G."
2,Wasn't comfortable on my Canon 7D,"I don't care for neck straps, so this seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately, it wasn't comfortable once installed. It was fine for just holding the camera, but it made taking pictures difficult."
2,"Great Seller, lowsy product!",It is a terrible design! Definitely not designed for a Canon XSI! Having said that it is better than nothing! But I still would not recommend this product to anyone!Update to my previous review!All though the design has its flaws I have become more accustomed to it! The connector plate for tripod use is very secure and safe for a heavy SLR/DSLR. I have also found that if change the way the strap adjuster is to the bottom instead of the top it is much more comfortable. It takes some getting used too as far as functionality it can limit rapid shooting! I would only recommend this product if you have small to medium hands and can't stand a neck strap!

And can has not got used still. ;-))"
4,Great for average-sized hands and no tripod available.,"Great for steadying the camera for those shots when a tripod isn't easy to setup. I find it great, but it's too small for my guy friend's hand (he's 6' 7""). Also, it attachs in the same places as my camera cover does, so it's a tight fit."
4,Great alternative to a neck strap,"I bought this to use with my Nikon D200 as a way to ""break free"" from those Neck Strap Blues. It works fine with the Mb-D200 vertical grip attached, although you do have to loosen it to change batteries (which you would have to do without the vertical grip anyway). But that is only a matter of unscrewing it a few turns - easy. The construction is pretty decent and it has a loop so you can still hook a neck strap on if you want. Even with the weight of the camera, vertical grip, super-wide/long lenses, and sb-800 speedlight, the hakuba camera grip holds tight and I never worry for the safety of my camera.My only mild complaint is that it takes some time to get it adjusted right so you can still have enough slack in your hand to operate functions and focus.Overall, I am VERY happy with it and think that, for the money, it's the best hand strap out there."
2,Not their best by a long shot,"Something's missing in this one that was there in the first couple of CDs where the songs were razor sharp. But these songs are neither wiseass or dark, like the great earlier tunes, they're just kinda flabby and safe. Weird. Where'd they go?"
4,Track listing,"From www.amazon.de:Audio CD: 11.The Great Pretender2.Wonderful Life3.She Drives Me Crazy4.Sweet Dreams5.Drive6.Johnny B.7.The Best8.Spirit In The Sky9.Kyrie10.Americanos11.Orinoco Flow12.Perfect13.The Harder I Try14.Hymn15.Licence To Kill16.Human17.When Doves CryAudio CD: 21.Take On Me2.Shout3.Faith4.Wot5.You Keep Me Hangin' On6.Who Needs Love Like That7.Precious Little Diamond8.When The Rain Begins To Fall9.Ghostbusters10.When The Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going11.Let The Music Play12.I Can't Wait13.Manchild14.A Love Bizarre15.Love Missile F1-1116.Theme From S'Express17.Pump Up The Volume"
2,Wrong part.,"The web site I ordered my headlight switch for my 68 Mustang, had the wrong part listed, the vendor did stand behind the return. I will use Amazon again in the future. Thanks.G"
3,Gotta be a better way,This saw really vibrates. Figured it would as it's a reciprocating saw but even when properly supported it hurts to use it for long. Several other issues are 1. The saw trigger (as you can see from the picture is on the blade side of the handle. This is probably good for working above your head but when doing flooring cut outs you have to use the trigger with your little or ring finger..not good. 2. For some reason the cord (which is very stiff) runs off the top of the handle (again from a floor perspective) this creates very bad dynamics as the cord is always trying to creep around the front of the saw where it could contact the blade which is definetley not good. Seems like a rear handle design for the cord would have made this a much freindlier saw. All said it makes a tough job easier.
4,under cut saw,"Althought there was some vibration, once I got used to how the saw worked the vibration became easy to overcome. It sure is better than doing it by hand. This blade is super. I hooked it to my old handle and works better than any i've used."
1,Don't bother,"This has got to be the worst power tool I've ever purchased. Ergonomics are poor, including the placement of the switch where only the little finger can be used to operate it. My saw came with no documentation or free replacement blade. The warning that this saw vibrates is a gross understatement. Chances are that you will let the blade chatter up and down your trim or jamb before you ever get a clean cut started. I went back to my manuel 10"" Stanley reversing backsaw. It takes a little longer, but produces much better/smoother results with much more control. I guess that sums up the Mortensen saw as it is totally OUT of control."
1,Do Not Buy This!!,I love Amazon and use them all the time - as I do Skype - but this phone is terrible - I have given up and boxed it up - software just does not work - look on line and see the litany of problems others are having
2,"Waste of money, time and effort","Tried the phone bc of dual use possibilities which were rare at time of purchase. Product didn't deliver. I sent it back after 3 days. More technologically savvy people probably can get higher return, regular people won't."
3,For those that like technical reading,You can get very bogged down with all the technical archeological speak in this book although it contains very good information for those willing to plow thru it.
5,Very Pleased,This was the first time I have ever replaced treads on a staircase. I ripped up carpet and put oak treads down. Nothing was square on this staircase. This tool made it so easy to cut the treads to fit. This tool made the finished job look like a pro had done the instalation. Shipping was very fast and it comes in a reusable storage container.
5,"If your building stairs, you need this tool",This tool worked perfectly for both treads and risers. I was adjustable to fit perfectly between skirt boards. The cuts were perfect on all treads and risers. For the risers you could set the height so it marked the boards at the exact spot based on the height so there was a tight fit.
5,Excellent stair guide. Worth the price.,"If you do trim work for a living, you can't afford not to have one of these. I have installed stair treads with and without this guide and I will never do one without it again. It will pay for itself on the first job in saved time.I have never seen a perfectly square inside to inside stairwell, and this guide will let you cut perfect treads every time.Well made, and 5 stars rating."
5,stair wizzard = $$,this tool is great the sliding dovetail arms are a little sticky but some wax fixes that. I have never done a stair case this fast and tight it is like i was cheating! i advise anyone who builds stairs to buy this tool it will pay for its self in the first 5 steps you do on a stair case. i have made other tools or jigs similar to this but this is by far the best and can be used for other things than stairs like wall to wall closet shelves .
3,Not what was in the picture,"I had ordered the PL200 stair wizard from Wheaton Tools,and I wasnt sent what was shown in the advertisement picture. It was stated that it was made out of metal,when in fact the tool I recieved was made out of wood and is pretty flimsy."
5,It has amazing heart and soul and mystery and reality.,"I am in awe of what Nan Gregory has been able to accomplish by page 2, the respect she has for her young audience's intelligence, and for all the seeds of other stories she plants along the way but chooses not to tell. Ron Lightburn's gorgeous, moody, illustrations help draw the reader (or listener) into Cindy's world, far away from sentimentality and cuteness. A great book; one day hope to read it (and Charlotte's Web) aloud without sobbing. Please give us more of Cindy."
5,Good product,"The is a nice looking faucet, it arrived sooner than expected and it works well. I can recommend this company."
2,Finite following,"2 1/2Much of this can come across almost laughable in its attempt to, under far less a range of talent, parlay the vaunted Godspeed aesthetic, yet it somehow cannot become entirely dismissed either."
2,not pleased,"Sometimes you get what you pay for. I bought these because they werent very expensive. When i separate them from the package and try to use them, the ends curl up, making them hard to use."
2,Not a bargain,The ends of these curled up and the product did not really seal well. I would not purchase these again. The pouches that came with my purple cow machine were much better quality. I will be looking for a different brand.
2,"This is a Lousy ""Guide""","I don't know why this is called an ""ultimate guide"" because it only covers one volcano, and it spends more time focusing on evacuation procedures for a nearby village than discussing volcanoes.I gave it two stars because it is somewhat educational, but it's still one of the worst volcano documentaries I have ever watched.I thinkNational Geographic - Volcano!is a far better choice, for any age group."
5,Great Product,"Most antiperspirants irritate my skin after using them for a few days, stain undershirts, etc. Not this one. Smells great and works great."
4,"A weighty, serious tome for serious readers","This text is now a bit dated: it does not cover the tumultuous events of the 90s. This book, nevertheless, covers what took place earlier in the 20th century with great depth and balance. Jelavich's book is for any person who wants a serious look into the history of the Balkans. Such knowledge is a must and a primer for a true understanding of the ""balkanization"" of the Balkans in the 1990s. If you want a quick, light read, this book in NOT for you. This book is at times heavy and hard, but is worth the effort."
4,Biography or some more about Author,cao! I would like to found more about Author s biography Thanks advance Boban Barbare
3,Decent,"Leonard Rosenman attempted to do the seemingly impossible for RoboCop 2: Creating a soundtrack superior to that of Basil Poledouris' original score for RoboCop. Unfortunately, he missed the mark. The soundtrack alone is a good listen, but mixed with the film, it doesn't seem to do the cyborg cop justice.Overall, Leonard Rosenman's score does a decent job and is worth a look."
5,under estimated ...,"Don't pay too much attention to the other reviews : Rosenman was a great composer, far greater than Poledouris will ever be ... The only reason why Robocop's score is prefered has to do with his harmonic simplicity and use of synthetizer and drums ... The score of Robocop 2, with its rich orchestration (including voices), suffers only of a too short CD edition. If you like Rosenman, if you like good symphonic music, don't miss that one !"
4,Fantasysoundtrack,"I have choosen and rating this Soundtrack becauce the People likes to now how it is.I like this Soundtrack very much,specially when it Fantasy.There is noting to recomment on this ProductMany Regards from SwitzerlandR.Cavallaro"
3,Robocop vs Star Trek - who would win in a fight?,"I do have to agree that Robocop 2 has a definite Star Trek IV feel, but that's like comparing Horner scores - yeah, they're all the same too. It's just the artist's style. In any case, Robocop was done by Basil Poledouris anyway, not Rosenman. Better to criticize when you have your facts right."
4,SHOWDOWN IN THE OLD WEST,"This debut novel has all the action packed page-turning twists that delight fans of Westerns.Our hero, Joe Trento, has worked and saved to buy a ranch in New Mexico. When some of his cattle are rustled, he heads for town to report it to the marshal..However, before he can reach his destination he is set upon by five men who accuse Joe of rustling their cattle and killing one of their hired hands.The question is how can Joe save himself and his ranch? Critser has done an excellent job of evoking images of the old West, and keeping readers interested until the good guys win."
5,Blast from the past,"I received the ""complete"" Macmillan Sky & Telescope Library as a gift back in 1975. Imagine my surprise when I recently discovered that a ninth volume, ""Space Science and Astronomy"" was published in 1976! Naturally, I needed to obtain a copy to complete the set. As it turns out, it is a very gratifying read. It contains a collection of essays, articles and editorials from Sky & Telescope going back to the late 1950s. It is fascinating to watch the progression from informed speculation, to tentative discoveries and, eventually, breathless reporting of space exploration milestones, recounted in appropriately technical language for an informed audience. As a chronicle of the development of modern Space Science, this is a unique publication. It was like reliving the excitement of the ""Space Race"" all over again."
2,How to be your own veteriarian,I have reviewed this book it is a excellent book The publisher tell me it is still availiable why are you not handling it? I would like to purchase a copy. Please let me know when you can provide it
1,I love music.. just NOT THIS!,"I am and will always be a music lover.. thats why I DO NOT love this.. it is NOT MUSIC.. just noise with a singer that GARBELS her way trough the songs.. I really gota say, maybe she should learn more notes that just 1!"
1,YIKES!,"You would think that with song titles like : MY MAN, BROKEN and TEARDROPS that there would be some FEELING in these songs.. well you would be wrong. I must say, very MONOTONE. Too bad :("
4,Soul Fishin' is a Great Catch,"It's not like me to buy without having heard at least one track on a CD, but I took a chance on Mad Hattie and it really paid off. This is a great folk-blues-rock collection with lyrics and music that blend seamlessly. It features fantastic incorporation of banjo and harmonica, as well as a few other classic instruments which have been sadly ignored by other current artists. The vocals are strong with the range of Janis Joplin, but mellowed with the classic style of Bonnie Raitt. Excellent for listening while working, driving, chatting over coffee or just kicking back. Try it! You'll find yourself being carried away for some ""soul fishin"" of your own."
5,Amazing!!,This album is the most beautiful and amazing music ever... Track 7. Your Baby is the best!!
4,Dreamy,"I agree with Chilipep. This is a nice little record. I'm not great at describing music either, but you should check it out if you're a fan of Luna. It's a dreamy little record. Ginger Snaps is one of my favorite songs. I just really like the way Dean and Britta's voices go together. Britta has a very sweet voice and Dean's low voice complements hers perfectly."
2,Bad album. Bad!,I bought this and it is a silly album that feels forced. Only the Doors cover song at the end is decent. Pity because Phillips has a great voice but the writing is awkward and I felt I wasted my money. I'm a huge Luna fan.
1,Not Luna,"I love Luna, this is not luna. That is the main thing to remember. For me this was a BAD thing. It wasn't as complex, and it was too sappy. A disappointment."
4,Very usefull,"Untill now, I think It is very strong an usefull. I had one, and now three of the same."
3,Not Her Best,"While the book was interesting enough to keep me reading, I thought it was too overdone.Duncan is basically willing to throw away everything he believes in for a woman he spotted across the room at a party. There's too much focus on that and not enough to playing out the whodunnit.And forget the whining, nagging, annoying DeeDee. I kept hoping someone would push her off the bridge during the investigation!"
3,I really look forward to Sandra 's books,"I enjoy the suspense and romance of all Sandra's books. Some have a little more than others. This one is average for me, but is very interesting! Definitely keeps you hanging in there to find out what is going to happen. A little slower than Chill Factor or White Hot, loved them.Another great book, just a little slower than some of the others.Highly recommend it for a vacation read or to take your mind off other things."
1,'Ric'kety crime drama,"I had typed up a longer review of this snoozefest, but it must have self-destructed from the novel's dullness!This is a lightweight 'crime drama-legal-thriller-romantic page-turner', which doesn't do justice any of those three genres.Yet another tired, cliched mess, filled with characters who are either unlikable or forgettable...much like the story itself! It's amazing how stories that read as if they were written in a few days can be so dull, they take weeks to finish!Once again, I find myself reading an author for the first time, disliking the story, and reading a lot of apologetic reviews from 'diehard fans' claiming that 'she's usually so much BETTER!' No offense, but I find Sandra Brown 'in contempt of readable fiction', and will not 'bail her out' by reading another one of her books."
3,poor character development has me ricocheting between reading Sandra's next book or not,"I have read all Sandra Brown's suspense/romance novels so I feel justified in saying that although Ricochet was a better read than White Hot or Chill Factor, I was again bothered by the poor character development. Duncan was a fairly well developed character--DeeDee somewhat better, but not much for any other players. The concept of ricocheting between the lies and deceit carried out by Elise, an unreliable character, is too much to ask of the reader. I am personally insulted that I was cheated out of the inner workings of Elise's mind, thoughts, and force fed her version of everything. The concept in writing is, ""show don't tell."" None of that here!The only recurring theme that exists in this book is, sex hound hot guy falls for dysfunctional hot girl. I finished this book believing that if this were a real couple their relationship wouldn't make it and that is not why I read this genre."
2,Not her best work...,"I've been a Sandra Brown fan for many years - and still am - however, I'm glad I borrowed this from the library rather than buy the hardback. This was definitely not her best work. Try your library first!"
2,Ricochet,"This book was a disappointment. I couldn't get drawn in because I didn't like the main characters. Duncan Hatcher was especially hideous. I don't know which was more disturbing, his involvement with suspect Elise, or his total disregard of police procedure. The story never seemed to end, and didn't have the expected drama and suspense."
2,not her best,"i have read every book by sandra brown and this like her last one chill factor was not very good. Her books have always been great like The Switch,or my personal favorite The Silken Web this book was not that good i knew ""who did it"" from the begining i just thought it was slow and wasn't very suspensful. i was disappointed."
1,Disappointing,I have read all of Sandra Brown's books and I have to say that this is the only book I did not like. I found it very contrived and boring. I usually pour through her books in two or three days. This one took me over two weeks to read because it just didn't keep me interested.
4,Nice read,"Wealth and high society can't stave off animal attraction, even in a good, honorable cop working a sticky murder case. Detective Duncan Hatcher and trophy wife Elise Cato send sparks flying. Elise is full of secrets and kind of a shady character. The suspense and sexual attraction is first rate. Ms. Brown, as always, does not disappoint.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"
3,"3.5, Lengthy Mystery","I didn't really like this book. It was ok, but it went on way too long. Typically, Brown has more of a romance backdrop to her stories. This one, didn't seem to. There was an attraction between the detective and the woman under investigation, but the mystery of the story overshadowed it. I found myself getting bored, waiting for it to end. There were alot of characters, and alot of dialogue. The story bounced around, involving character after character. I wasn't very impressed.Not one of my favorite Brown novels."
2,Not her best,"Sandra Brown is my favorite suspense/romance writer. I always look forward to reading her new releases and this book was no exception. However, I was very disappointed with Ricochet. Normally, her books have so many twists and turns that you can't figure out ""who did it"" until the very end, which keeps you up all night wanting to read. This book was different. I kept thinking it would get better but it never did. I highly recommend Chill Factor or White Hot instead of Ricochet."
2,Okay story with dull characters,"While the story line was okay, the characters of this book did not work for me. While Duncan was okay for the most part, he was written one dimentinal and flat. Elise just didn't have any redeeming qualities at all. Between the two, it seemed that there wasn't much more than a physical attraction on Duncan's part and Elise wanting to use Duncan (like she does many others).The story itself had an interesting plot, but the characters just weighed it down and the result for me was very forgettable.The best character in this story was Dee Dee, Duncan's partner. She's bright, intutive, tough, caring and funny."
2,Ever heard of fact checking?,"I mean really, just have someone (publishing staff, maybe?) check some of the facts or at least catch some of the glaring inconsistencies in this book. It's like no one took the time to read through it before it hit the press. OK, it's fiction and a light read. I don't expect too much. But it's just all too distracting to enjoy.Please try to stay somewhere within the realm of possibility. . . I especially like how we go from murder to conviction to sentencing in just 4 months . . . so realistic . . . this book was just a big yuck."
4,"A good book, despite the clichés","I really enjoyed this book. I'm a great Sandra Brown's fan, despite her clichés. In ""Ricochet"" there are glimpses of ""Fat Tuesday"" (a detective with a grudge against a powerful person of a court of law and his strong attraction to his trophy wife), ""The Alibi"" (the cool, beautiful and sexy heroine with an obscure past, and the hostility between her and the hero's female partner) and ""French Silk"" (the sexual involvement of the main male character and his prime suspect during the investigation, placing his career in jeopardy). However, the story is really good, full of surprises, unexpected twists and some witty lines."
4,Brown's ability to write characters is amazing!,"Sandra Brown's amazing ability to pen believable and fascinating characters once again saves the day in this latest book. The husband/wife murder plot is a little convoluted and over the top at times and it's sewn up a little too conveniently in the end but by the time you get there, you care about Brown's characters and enjoy their quirks, faults and strengths so much that you can't wait to see what they do next and you don't want to bid them goodbye. I recommend this one heartily. It's better than Chill Factor. It's also nice to see that Brown hasn't forgotten that one of her strengths is being able to weave a dynamic romance into the storyline once again. I think in trying to 'prove' to the world what a good suspense writer she was, that she strayed too far away from romantic angles which she's such a master with. This one is worth the read-check it out!"
2,So So,"A book to bring on your vacation and leave behind. The chief detective has a perpetual hard on for the main suspect and seems to be in a daze because of his infatuation. Lust constitutes the romance part of this story and the twist and turns, well -- ho, hum. I have read better. The prose is plebian."
2,second and last S.B. novel,"This is my second Sandra Brown novel and will be my last. I read one that a neighbor loaned me.Fat Tuesday. And have finished my second one Ricochet. Are these thinly disguised romance novels or what? 1st we have the ruggedly handsome detective and the fallen angel who is prostitiing herself for what ever reasons to the big wealthy crook that said detective is out to get. And then at some point the detective and fallen angel end up by or on a river/ bayou/ lake etc. and crew like bunnies.YUCK! this is a romance novel and the 2 I have read are so predictable. But then again I don't read romance novels. If you like ""real"" mysteries skip these books!"
1,Somebody Shoot Me,"I got a little over halfway through and I had to stop. I am a big Sandra Brown fan but this reads nothing like her. The plot is juvenille and just plain boring. I kept thinking that even I could write a better book. I found nothing enticing about the characters or what was happening to them. I can't believe this made it past the publisher's desk! Here is what you need to know. There are long, drawn-out conversations and sequences that go into heights of unecessary detail that I have never seen from Sandra Brown before. I found myself in agony trying to get through them, thinking, ""WHO CARES???"" This is one of the most SLOW MOVING books I have ever read. I could barely bring myself to pick it up. Do your self a favor and skip this one. Pick up ""Chill Factor"" and ""Where There's Smoke"" instead."
1,Boring and unbelievable,"I read at least 3 mysteries and/or general fiction each month. I skipped over the last few chapters of this book because the characters and situation were completely unbelievable. The cops would never compromise themselves this way. The primary female character was a perfect barbie-doll, dead-eye shot, topless waitress concubine who's motivation was obscure and actions reprehensible. When I read that ""she looked wistfully at the little kids on the playground"" after getting a selfless tubal ligation, I gave up. The novel's climax was ridiculous. I usually like Sandra Brown, but this was awful."
2,so so,"I usually like her books, but this one left me disappointed. The story did not have much meat behind it."
3,Maybe 2.5?,"This book had a pretty good story line, but like other reviewers stated, there wasn't a likeable character in the bunch. There was no one to care about, to cheer for. The story itself seemed very familiar to me, tho' I know for certain I had not read it before. Too much formula? All in all, not a satisfying read. Try 'Play Dirty' if you're looking for a good Sandra Brown book. It remains one of my favorites."
3,Not Brown's Best!,"Sandra Brown is one of my favorite authors and with her emergence into the mystery/romance combination; her books usually keep me turning pages as fast as I can read them. However, RICOCHET seemed to miss the mark for me and only fell to the average range. That was a huge disappointment to me - Sandra Brown does not write average books."
1,Surprisingly dull,"Sandra Brown's books are usually very engrossing and enjoyable. However, this was the one exception. Except for the opening scene, there was very little in the way of drama or action. It was mainly police interrogations followed by the ""he said...she said"" type of stuff. And I grew weary of reading about Detective Hatcher's hard-ons for the victim/suspect (who happens to be married) on every other page. I normally finish a good book within 4-5 days and I had reached the point where I was dreading having to pick this one up. It took two weeks for me to make it only halfway through the book before I decided to put it down for good."
2,Dissappointing,I have never read a book by Sandra Brown that I did not like.....until now. IT was long drawn out and just downright boring at times. If this is by chance the first book by Sandra borwn that you have read don't make it the last. All the other books that I have read by her were great!
5,Awsome Single! Great Music! Great Cover!,"This Limited Edition Cd single, ""It's Gonna Be Me"" offers two great tracks performed by the talented *NSYNC. The first track is the well known album version of ""It's Gonna Be Me"". The Second track is the Maurice Joshua Remix (Radio Edit)(of ""It's Gonna Be Me""). The remix has a great beat and sound, that makes it a new personal favorite of mine. Oh, yes may I mention the COVER, it is very unique! I recommend this CD-SINGLE, to anyone who enjoys the music of *NSYNC or loves to groove!~"
5,EXCELLENT!,"This is a fantastic song -- so catchy, so singable and OF COURSE really danceable! But buy the whole CD, not just the single, since each and every track is worth repeating time and again. Even if you've never been a fan of these five guys, give this a listen.I was never a fan before NO STRINGS ATTACHED came out, and now I'm so hooked that I drove 500 miles round trip from my hometown just to see Nsync perform live in concert! The show was worth every minute in traffic!I hope they outlast the other boy bands that don't stand a chance (and I'm NOT referring to the Backstreet Boys because I think they are dynamite too!)Thanks Lance, JC, Joey, Justin and Chris. You're more than just good looks and great dance moves -- you have real talent!"
4,"A good thriller--and hey, I learned something in the process","Ernesto's Ghost was, initially, not my kind of book. The cover picture seemed bland and, on top of that, it was about Cuba (A place I know little about). But, since I'd been recommended the book and given a copy, I thought, ""Why not?"" Well, once I got started, I was hooked. It's a thriller about an American professor who unwittingly gets involved with the CIA on a research trip to Cuba...and the resulting fallout. There is suspense, drama, and romance...everthing necessary to keep me reading. And, on top of that, in the end, I walked away knowing a lot more about Cuba."
5,I Could Not Put It Down,"It has been a long time since I have read such an intriguing book. The combination of politics, geography, mystery and romance was just incredible. I was fascinated with the intricate details that made Cuba come alive for me and I, literally, could not put it down. The characters became ""real"" during my entire adventure while reading the book as Edward Gonzalez has a wonderful way with words. I highly recommend this as both entertaining and academically enriching."
4,Spy-thriller set in Cuba,Ernesto's Ghost spirits you back to Cuba in the 1970's at the height of the Cold War. The plot takes so many interesting twists and turns that you don't realize how much you've learned about Cuban political intrigue until after you've finished the novel.
3,serviceable,"This map of Iran is serviceable enough, including a close-up job of downtown Tehran.But it's a road map, intended for travelers. What would have been nice is if they had printed the Farsi equivalent of the English place names below the latter, but no such luck. The entire map is in English. With the exception of major cities, the place names you'll see when you are actually in Iran will all be in Farsi.In the interests of space, the mapmakers have divided Iran: the front of the map is one half of Iran, the back of the map the other half. For this reason, if you're ordering this map for a wall display, you're going to be seriously disappointed."
3,valerie Australia,"I found this book to be very helpful with all the practical advice contained. As a journal it contained blank pages throughout for thoughts etc to be recorded but in essence not enough room. As a carer I use a diary to record daily happenings and sometimes if time permits I might jot down any unusual sayings by the patient or change in mood etc. Carers are usually too busy to concentrate on themselves for very long so in essence as a ""journal"" it was not up to scratch but the content was excellent and would make a great ""booklet"" to be given out to anyone suddenly facing the prospect of caring for a terminally ill person at home .Or alternatively a caregivers ""diary"" plus helpful tips interspersed.I am currently looking after my husband at home and was initially totally overwhelmed by the task but thanks to Amazon and the internet was able to help myself by obtaining information .Great service thank you."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"While George Smiley only makes a brief appearance in The Looking Glass War it is still a worthwhile book.The main thrust is an inter-departmental intelligence agency turf war, and also the possibility of Soviet missiles emplacements causing problems for the West Germans.An old agent is reactivated and sent to look into the problem."
3,Looking Glass War,"A Fictitious prose narrative portraying characters and actions representative of real life in real warfare. The plot is real but the grammatical style was not easy reading. I was glad to reach the end of the novel, but disappointed to be left with a seemingly unfinished work. I plan to try a few other Le Carre's"
4,Fantastic Product!,"Use this stuff with a sprayer to safely and easily dissolve all sorts of spots, from carpeting to sneakers. Looked everywhere for higher strength peroxide than standard weak 3%, and found it here. The best stain remover ever!"
4,8% Peroxide,"This product works rather well for bleaching without harshness. The shipping was just as promised, about one week."
2,a disappointment for some,"Obviously some fans have enjoyed this album, so I'm not trying to say it isn't good-- only that it is EXTREMELY different from Martin Swan's first Mouth Music project, which I found brilliant. In my humble opinion, I think that the vocals really hurt the songs-- they don't capture the spirit as Talitha McKenzie did. Also, with the exception of one or two songs, the music is a bit weak and underdeveloped.For those who are wanting to check out Mouth Music for the first time, I'd suggest staying away from this album as it isn't a fair representation of Martin Swan's incredible talents. I'd recommend going for the very first album, Mouth Music, or the newest, Seafaring Man (which is very different than the first, but equally brilliant).Please refrain from saying that my review is unhelpful if you merely disagree with me. Cheers."
4,2 Very Good Soundtracks = 1 Great CD,"These are 2 very similar soundtracks. Written in late 80's. I would categorize them as New Age/Chamber Orchestra/Woodwinds. More low key than the westerns Bernstein is most famous for but never the less 2 of his better ones. Nice and pleasant to listen to with each containing a memorable theme. My favorite tracks are 1,9,10,13,16"
5,"Excellent!! Readable, focused and informative.","I have found Dr. Hobson's ""The Chemistry of Conscious States"" to be far more helpful than Candace Pert's ""Molecules of Emotion"". Thank you, Dr. Hobson!"
4,nice lense but limited range,its great if you need the stop range but true focal in a digital puts this lense in the wierd position of being not wide enough and not flexable enough on the close shots...if you do a lot of kid candids..buy it..otherwise get more range.
4,good debut book by Nelson George,"I remember back in 83 buying this book. this was Nelson George's first Book. it was a quick cool read on MJ from his Jackson five days through ""Thriller"". it had some random things about MJ's favorite artists&things which was cool. i remember lending this book to a Chick I was digging back in the day. about 8-9 years ago I went into a Used Book store&Found this Book again. I got it again. Huge MJ fan&always will be. Huge Respect&Props to Nelson George as well."
2,Dont bother with this one....,"Stay away from the 810. Crain has a great undercut saw. The 555 Multi Undercut saw. It is a great saw and you can get a nice cut. Also look for the heavy-duty version, you can undercut brick with it when using a masonary blade. The model number on this is 820. Also check out the Crain 795 toe kick saw. It is very nice and now includes a case.EricInstallertools.com"
3,Life of a Dominican Woman,"This movie is about all what a woman suffers in a macho society, in this case, the Dominican Republic, that although it is a very modern country it still has the mentality of the decade of the 50's.It is a comedy of how a woman put on spell on her husband, and the world is upside down, he is the neglected husband staying at home taking care of the child. The whole world is now feminist, and as cruel as a macho society.I like it, because it shows dependency is an abuse-builder, and I think it is really funny, educational and entertaining."
1,this book is so lame,i am a professional game programmer and i think this book sucks. it was so so so out of date and it cost a little to much for a piece of crap. i would suggest getting the Opengl Super Bible.i write better code.
3,"Overrated, but there's barely anything better out there","This is not a good book for beginners at all. The explanations are very hard to follow and are rather boring. However, experienced OpenGL users will want to use this book, interestingly enough, as a kind of reference. Just because there doesn't seem to be any book out there that's better does not mean that this book deserves 5 stars.I ended up learning by looking at people's code (the Nehe tutorials and others) and then referring back to selected sections in the red and blue book as well as asking on newsgroups and mailing lists before I could figure out things. In other words, with this book, you've still got your work cut out for you when learning OpenGL. However, once you start learning more, this book might become more invaluable."
5,great reference book,"This is the definitive OpenGL guide and reference book. It is hands-down the best reference book covering all basic OpenGL operations. I'm very satisfied with my purchase, and I use it every day."
5,Concise e fast way to start programming with OpenGL,"Very well writen, simple and excelent. Don't forget to download Mesa from www.mesa3d.org and take a look, also, on the OGL Reference Manual and the OpenGL Programming for The X Windows System by Mark Kilgaard"
4,Good for game engine developers,"This book is good if you plan on developing a game engine. If you are hoping to develop mature and polished games then this is not the book. This book is for people who are interested in building game engines like corona sdk, unity, cocos 2d etc. If you want to build games, just go purchase any 2D or 3D game engines and you'll be up and running in no time. Raw OpenGL is not a practical way to build mature and polished games."
5,This is one amazing book.,This was my first pick and i would like to mention that i had no prior experience with Opengl. The book has been organized in a very understandable manner and the learning curve is not that bumpy.
1,Not as described.,"The description for this audio book, lists 14 different stories, on 2 discs. There are only 13 stories, and they are different from the one's advertised. The product information should be changed to describe what will be sent, not what is offered for purchase. If I had known the ""actual"" track listing, I would not have purchased this item through Amazon. Instead, I would have purchased from an actual book store."
2,Illustrations are not the same style as on the cover,"I bought this edition specifically because I wanted to have some illustrations like the ones on the cover (I'm designing some costumes for a production of ""Into the Woods"" and wanted to use this book as inspiration). However, the illustrations inside the book are not AT ALL like the ones on the cover. I've returned the book and forgot to check, but I would guess that they are not even by the same artist. I love how Amazon now has images within books, however, this one didn't have any of the inside illustrations and so I didn't realize until I recieved the book. I'm still on the search for a book of fairy tales with medieval period illustrations."
2,Beutiful stories terribly translated,I remember reading and hearing many stories from this book when I was a child and they made quite an impression. This particular translation however leaves a lot to be desired. It seems that some parts were translated word for word and much of the text makes no sense at all.
2,"no music at all, despite the cover says so.","It is a bit disappointing that an audio book that is sold as a combination of music and classic literature for children has not music at all.well it has some music, a short intro at the beginning of each story. that's it. No sounds, no effects, no music...only the voice of the narrator. The narrator is very good, and the stories from Cinderella to Little Red Riding Hood are interesting and attractive for children. But the simple voice of the narrator is not enough to keep children between 3 and 4 interested in stories longer than 10 minutes (all but few are longer than 10 min.). Perfect would be 5 minutes for that age range (3 or 4).Another drawback is the fact that the CDs do not go with a book, so you need to buy a book for each story with pictures suitable for children of 3 or 4. Of course,less problematic are those issues for older children."
4,Excellent Grouping of Songs,"This CD was a pleasant surprise. Filled with songs about all the most important things in life: God, Family & Country. I enjoyed the wide variety of artists and the messages each had to share."
5,So lovely it hurts!,"These songs have a haunting, gentle beauty that makes my heart ache. The title song has a voice that reveres its own words. And all the songs sweep over me like the soothing sound of rain on the roof. All the artists who contributed can know that what they have created is a gift to the world that is truly appreciated."
5,Lehigh CM9H Power Tool Hanger,I use mine for holding my Stihl brush cutter. I works great and provides a handy place for storing the unit which has an extra long shaft.
3,"Great Perfume, but seemed like it was sitting there for a while","I've loved Gai Mattiolo since the 1990's but it's a shame to say this product arrived and the spray seemed old like it had been sitting on the shelves since the 1990's. The place I got this was great as far as sending me another one but I have to say the next one was the same ""old"" quality. I just think the brand stopped doing well and they have had these products sitting on the shelves for really long time."
5,Worth every penny!,This book is fabulous! The imagery is awesome and the designs chosen are very well thought out. This is a great reference of design using handmade or hand-incorporated elements. Its nice to be able to get away from digital design every now and then. I really like the way they included the designers thoughts on their compositions. I can't stop looking at this book. You won't be disappointed with your purchase.
4,Great!,"I bought this book as a gift for someone else, but after seeing it in person I'm thinking of buying it for myself! It is a beautiful book!"
4,Very cool,"When relying on a computer all day, this book lets you return to how it all began. Get creative! Draw, doodle, color, cut, create and interpret this into your latest computer-aided design."
2,OK graphic design book,I bought this book after Amazon recommended it...Pros: It has pictures and less words.Caveats: examples are average. I owe illustration books that give better ideas.Summary: It is average and likely overrated. I am afraid it will be buried in my library....I better put it for sale on this site..mmm...
2,More Wall Than Door,"Wells is never quite able to break free from an industrial age mindset, and this has always been one of his drawbacks for me towards the appreciation of his work. The title story stands on its own as a classic juxtaposition of cosmopolitan worldliness against idyllic innocence, but Wells was never visionary enough to transcend his time, and his scientific suppositions seem quaint by today's standards, especially ""A Dream of Armageddon"" which is pretty much a contradiction in terms, even if one accepts the historical constraints on the author. ""The Lord of the Dynamics"" is also offensively exploitative even if you allow for the bigotry of the age. There may be some minor typographical errors that the text preparer missed, particularly in ""The Cone,"" I am not sure, but if you like the faith in mechanical supremacy that so called classical speculative fiction offers, then you like H.G. Wells, but he just isn't quite my cup of tea, even conceding his place as a master storyteller."
5,Comfort says it all,"I have used other respirators purchased at local stores, as well as the 3M-53P71. However, locally all the stores including Lowe's, Homedepot, Ace Hardware etc. only carry Medium sized masks, and their prices are up to double that available on Amazon.com---All respirators are required to perform according to the application of their design, and this respirator does all things it is required to do by design very well. This 3M is noticibly light and the fit is extremely important. The mask is flexible and conforms to my face as comfortably, and maybe more so than other respirators I have used. The fact that I went to Amazon.com to get the right size Mask that I cannot buy locally is important not to mention sellers offering all sizes at substantial price savings. I have not found a respirator that I like better than the 3M, it's a good buy in my opinion."
3,ehh..,the only enjoyment i got with this was opening the pack of cards then i got bored. soo was it worth buying these? i say no unless you have a lot of money to waste.
5,Prime vitamins for birds,The product is excellent for domestic birds. The seller was prompt and I would order from them again.
4,Interesting Work,This book is edited by Marc Allen. He has changed the language style to present day making the book more readable. I believe he has gotten to the essece of the original work and certainly can be used as a center pillar meditation.
3,"Bowles insight, Dillon too interested in herself.","Having spent a good deal of time reading the work of Paul Bowles, I found it an interesting read for the fact that it gave insight to Bowles and his recollections of life in a fascinating time. A time of which he shaped a piece. He's a tremendously interesting character, all the more engaging because of his modesty and self effacing style.I found Millicent Dillon's style to be rather annoying, however. Dillon constantly returns to a focus on herself. She writes endlessly about herself, how she feels, how she writes, how she fits into it all - and that's not why I bought the book. I wanted to read about Bowles, and found Dillon putting herself into way too much of the book. She'd never be mistaken for a fly on the wall."
2,A portrait of who?,"I have to agree with another reviewer, I didn't think it was a radical new direction for biography either... I'm not even done with the book yet and I'm still waiting for Ms. Dillon to begin shifting the focus of her investigations away from herself and Jane Bowles.Right now I'm thinking that perhaps I'd prefer reading The Invisible Spectator by Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno. Maybe that would be a better portrait of Mr. Bowles..."
3,Was she had?,"Just finished the book. Fascinating in its detail about Bowles' life in North Africa. But, a new form of biography? No, I don't think so. Rather, a series of extended interviews with Dillon's highly subjective and personal analytical apparatus attached to them. Or, simply a memoir. I think there is a great danger of loss of perspective when a writer admires his / her subject too much, as well as admiring too much his / her relationship with the subject. I had this uncanny feeling all throughout the book that Bowles, as he did with other people he knew, was stringing Dillon along, knowing he could hand here just about anything for posterity. The photograph on the back fold of the dust jacket speaks volumes, as Dillon gazes in what looks like rapture upon an apparently inert Bowles. He wasn't that good of a writer. And, I disagree with both of them. Sheltering Sky was a fine film...."
4,neat,"Hubert is an inventor in Ancient Sumeria. This is his story. He invents the wheel and it's GREAT! Everyone around loves it, until the Assyrians try to use it against the Sumerians in battle!"
3,I expected other edition,"When I bought this book I spected to have the cover edition that came in the picture, insted of I recibed the edition after the movies projections that is a dark picture with a group o people walking. I think that idea to put a picture is try to sale exactly the same. It is very important for books and CD..But, any way, I recibed the book and it came in good conditions"
4,If you already own the Soy Zone don't buy this one,"The soy zone is a wonderful book, I purchased this one, because I thought it was full of recipes. Instead it was just a paperback copy of the Soy Zone. I rated the Soy Zone 5 out of 5, it is really a wonderful book for Vegetarians wanting to follow the Zone diet."
3,Good for a short time,"I drink a few of the breakfast smoothies every day, but this is not a good long term diet. I am older, in my forties, and realized my body could no longer process carbs like they did a few years go. So, it is good to make you more aware of what is a carb (everything, pretty much) and what isn't. Some of the recipes are just gross and some are just okay. None are so good you want to have them more than once ( other than the smoothies). I did lose a few pounds , but if you do not adopt this as a lifestyle, you will gain them back. I will continue to refer to this book for ideas."
4,Lifestyle Update,"I find that even if you do not plan on partaking in the Zone diet... since I know a lot of people do not like counting carbs every day, the recipes in this book are wonderful! Sometimes being a vegetarian it is hard to find recipes for new things, this book is wonderful in helping you find the protein you need in your diet, but also making things taste good."
2,Soy Zone=Soy Allergy (For Some),"I've been a vegan for years and I was excited that there was finally a vegan version of the protein-diet. This plan got me eating soy several times a day, at least twice the amount of my usual habit. A couple of months into this diet, I developed a very bad eczema-type skin condition, coupled with a very bad depression. Unfortunately, it didn't occur to me that my problems could be the result of a soy allergy until later in the year (since I've had a history with bad skin and depression), so I endured almost 8 months of abject misery. Another symptom of this plan seemed to be that I actually gained weight.So, I just want people who undertake this plan to be aware that if you experience weight gain, bad skin and depression, you may have an allergy. And, no, I haven't found a more suitable vegan weight-loss plan yet."
5,Finally....Something That is really country!,"I'll keep it simple. I have owned this cd for several months and it is still in my CD player. I never do that (except with Gary Allan). I buy alot of CDs and usually do not like them. In fact I usually give them away to the people riding in the car with me because their so terrible. Anyway, every track is great. If you dont like this you ""aint country enough""."
5,good songs,"I really like this CD. I bought it specifically for one song, but realized after I got it, there are a lot of songs on here I really like. I'm very glad that I got it."
5,He's great live and in person,"The Jeff Bates Rainbow Man CD is a must have for any fan of true country music. His unique voice along with years of real and personal experience make this album something country music has needed for a long time. I recently was able to see Jeff up close and in person sing a few songs from this CD, and he sounded incredible. If you're a true country music lover, you won't be sorry you bought this CD."
4,HOMEBOY'S BACK & CRUISIN' THE HOOD!,"HOMEBOY'S BACK & CRUISIN' THE HOOD! Dion, the original wanderer just released his first album of new material in about 5 years, DEJA NU, and the kid's still got it. Recorded with the same equipment and techniques he used on his historic hits ""Runaround Sue"" & ""The Wanderer"" the cuts on this disc swing in a classic 50's style. He does a couple of Springsteen songs to bring things up to date and does a nice job of it. So check out this new release from my fellow Bronx Boy."
4,Very enjoyable music,This is a very good CD. The songs are strong and the band is right there with Dion as he works his magic. This includes two songs written by Springsteen and is just very good music with an update to the Doo Wop sound and some nice pop tunes. Of particular enjoyment for me was the excellent sax which is featured on many of the cuts. Dion has continued to make good music many years after his star burned brightest.
5,A keeper! I read it at least once a year. It is uplifting.,"This story, based on a real woman's life, is impossible to put down! It walks you through her life as a small child through senior adulthood. The lessons she learned along the way are presented such a way you find yourself visualizing each scene. You will cry, laugh, and anguish over Lucy's life. I first read this book as a 6th grader ( I was/am a bookworm ) and made the mistake of loaning it never to be seen again. I could not begin to describe the joy I felt several Christmas's ago when my mother found a copy and gave it to me."
1,Ruined by horrible voice over,"This movie was originally shot in Swedish, and is brought to us with an English re-dub, not subtitles. Unfortunately, irrespective of however outstanding this movie may be, the English dubbing is so horribly done that it is unwatchable. This is not a matter of preference for high vs low budget or any other highly subjective, qualitative factor, but a simple observation that any reasonable English speaker will likely share. The experience would have been infinitely better had they presented in its native format with subtitles. Too bad."
2,be honest,"O come on, this book was boring and convoluted and you know it. It's just a stream of introverted thought. It's like ""notes from the underground"" except nothing happens. I love you Camus but give us a break"
4,The Angusty Of Camus,"In my humble opinion, after reading all of the works of Albert Camus, I still think that ""The Fall"" its one of the best works from him, the angusty and anger of Camus is reflected in the ways of Jean Baptiste, the critics are incrideble, and the plot is simple but with such a bitirness...Such an amazing work..."
4,Clearing the air,"It is essential to note that Camus was raised in the Catholic tradition, however widely he distanced himself from it in later life; he was not Jewish as a previous reviewer states, perhaps confusing only in that regard Camus with Elie Wiesel.In all his work, Camus deals with the dilemma posed by the injustices suffered by all humanity. Believing himself faced with the choice between an all-powerful God who allows man's inhumanity to man and a benevolent God who seems powerless to prevent injustice, Camus chose no God at all. I can't agree with him--these two options are not the only possible explanations of injustice--but I respect the courage with which, time and again, Camus confronts us with the question: why do the innocent suffer?In doing so, he is no respecter of persons, nor is Wiesel. Both are or were profoundly moved by injustice in all forms and instances, and each champions the human rights of all people."
2,confusion arose while reading this,"I had to read this book for my Lit. class and I'm in 12th grade and I found it very confusing, yet it made me think about what sins I have made. I have never read a Camus piece before, but the whole written in 2nd person thing kinda makes me lose interest in the plot."
3,"Not Quite The Plague, But Still Good","Camus succeeds again in making me feel empathetic to his protagonist and profoundly uncomfortable with the complicity his accusatory prose forces on me. When reading him, I find beauty in Camus's brilliance but little with his turn of phrase. This isn't a book to read for escapist kicks. It took me three days to finish 148 pages.You can read my full-length reviews at LitBeetle.com."
5,Best Book Ever Written. Period..........,"I've been reading some of the reviews for this book and can't believe that there are so many people writing about this book without really understanding it. I have read this book about a dozen times, never read any other book more than once. The first time I read it I thought it was very boring and dry, just two guys talkng in a bar. The second time I thought this Jean-Baptiste guy might be the devil talking.About the sixth time I really understood it. The narrator of the story is the Devil himself (for real). And he was talking not to somebody in the bar, but he was talkng to me personally (for real).This book changed my outlook on life and my actions in life. Just about every word in every sentence has more than one meaning. Does anyone else get this from the book?"
5,Jean-Baptiste Clamence's post-WWII Europe,"Camus introduces to the reader, in a rare second-person point of view, to Jean-Baptiste Clamence. Camus' novel is almost interactive, with Clamence answering the reader's questions and taking the reader's hand. At points in the novel, the reader is actually telling Clamence what to do, and he is responding back. It is slightly eerie, but ingenious. The novel, however, is about Clamence's experiences in WWII, and how he has survived to become a deranged, off-kilter person. The last chapter is where Clamence exposes it all, in a confessional mode, and tells with his brutal candor what happened in WWII to make him become the way that he is. It is a fascinating novel, though depressing, as usual for Camus!!"
3,"A bit slow, but overall a good read.","I was assigned this book to read for school, and being a fan of existentialism, I was excited to start reading it. Unfortunately, that excitement died down rather quickly as I proceeded through this book...The one thing that makes this book different and appealing, is the same thing that makes it painstaking to read at times. There is only one character throughout the entire book. His rhetoric seems stale at times, and is very random in its approach. This book is an interesting monologue, but that's all it is.Overall I am a big fan of Camus; 'The Stranger' was amazing. Unfortunately, I would say that 'The Fall' isn't his best work. I agree with one of my fellow reviewers in saying, ""This book is more of a study of character than a novel"" If you're looking for intriguing dialogues, read some of Sartre's plays."
2,"very different from ""The Stranger""","I loved ""The stranger"" so much that as soon as I finished reading it, I went out and bought ""The fall"" and ""The Plague"". I have to say that I am very dissappointed by ""The fall"". The idea behind the book is very interesting, but it somehow falls flat and ends up being very boring. The language is profoundly different from that of ""The stranger"" which I loved for its concise sentences. ""The fall"" is very tedious reading and despite the fact that it is short book, it feels very long."
5,I can only give five stars?,"How can I sum up the story, the plot? It's really like describing a Degas. The book gives you a feeling, and reading it is more than a mere intellectual pursuit. To call The Fall a work of art is a disservice. To attempt to explain for Camus what this book is saying is hubris at best. The central character of the story describes his fall from his lofty perch of moral rectitude. But has he really fallen? Or has he just become more cynical, of his own nature true, but of humanity in general? It seems as his self-loathing grew, his love of his fellow man contacted. Enough, I am ashamed at my pretentiousness. But really, if you are in high school, you probably aren't ready for The Fall. But if you are ready, the Fall is a work of incomparable profundity. It is over too soon, you will find."
1,Falls with a thud,"This ""novel"", if you want to call it that, consists of an ex-lawyer who calls himself a ""judge-penitent"" prattling on to a presumably interested (though I can't figure out why) fellow he meets at a bar about his life. I suppose he is confessing, in a way, yet I found his confessions to be full of arrogance and pride even from the beginning, especially concerning his sexual conquests. If I were the listener, I'd try to get away from this blowhard as soon as I could. As a reader, I did manage to finish the book, after all it is fairly short and not particularly difficult. Many people who read this believe that it describes the human condition well, and can see glimpses of themselves in this man. Well, if they look hard enough, most people could see glimpses of themselves in the Unabomber, too. I found this book to be a total waste of time."
4,Bleak but Beautiful,"Bleak but beautiful, The Fall is one of those books that reveals humans for what they are. The lawyer protagonist has worked all his life for justice, but to what end? He would like to believe that he has a selfless interest in downtrodden people and lofty ideals, but as the book progresses he is forced to confront his hypocrisy. He works hard ultimately for himself, he enjoys the public image of himself as a selfless person. The realization tortures him, and to resolve the hypocrisy he stops all his charitable endeavors and hurls himself into a life of selfish pleasure. But can any of us claim true selflessness? Camus is of course a master at showing us the hypocrisy and ridiculousness lurking under our highest ideals, and this book is no exception."
4,Existentialist masterpiece,"I read the old Penguin translation over ten years ago, and have re-read it a couple of times since. This is my favorite Camus book: very sombre and thought-provoking, I cant do better than to quote Phillip Toynbee ... ""one of those books which lie like yeast in the mind, producing all sorts of strange fermentations later on ...""Some years later, when I read Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov, I realized that he had managed to convey what Camus does in this book in a single two page conversation between Father Zosima and Katerina Ivanovna. Though I still like this book, this is mainly for stylistic reasons now."
3,.,"The least memorable Camus novel that I have read. The other books are more interesting as pieces of literary art, I think; by the time I got around to reading this novel, I'd already been through the whole ""morality as empty formality"" thing a number of times. And as I remember it (it's been a while), the brunt of the book is simply building up to and expounding on this idea. None of this is to say that it is a bad book; it is worth reading. Some may find it extremely rewarding. But I can't say it's a personal favorite."
3,Experience falling into the prose of Camus,"This is the first book I've read by Camus. I picked it up out of curiosity and was immiediately intrigued by the unique 2nd person narrative. I hadn't read anything in this perspective before. It was a decent read. Although I didn't find it exciting or much entertaining, when I was finished with it, I was glad I read it and could think about it's messages. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an intro to an easy philosophical read: it's short (I read it in 2 days) and at times it can be entertaining (I liked the narraters nod to the Greeks as he mentions the men holding hands in the streets). Overall, I was glad I read it. Afterwards, I thought of people I've encountered who seem flawless in everyway, but I can look at them differently now. No one is perfect!"
3,"Flawed, but Entrancing Camus","I didn't think this book rose to the achievement of The Stranger in terms of the nuances and all the things contained in every passage of The Stranger. However, the prose is just as excellent. This book is essentially the confession of a Parisian lawyer who, like many existential heroes, experiences a transformation out of self-reflection and adopts an unconventional attitude towards society. In this case, he becomes a ""judge-penitent"" (read the book to understand this concept), a man who absolves and convicts people. He twists our perception of human guilt and innocent before one another and the whole human race. While I found some of his long-winded speeches too gratuitious and abstract for a novel, it fits the philosophical mold of the book. This is a keen psychological dig into human conscience and the despair rising out of the modern spiritual need."
2,Confusion reigns while reading this book.,"The Fall was assigned to me for a book report, and while reading it I constantly find myself nodding off. I can't tell who's doing what or who's saying what."
3,Typically Camus.,A difficult book. No story line to follow. A monologue aimed to expose the diseases eating into man and his society. May have some connections with times of the writer but his purpose remains remote to the reader. Ideas and confessions in strands and pieces tend to make up a case for 'The Fall' but takes the reader no where. An attempt to mirror certain ideas and to be honest with oneself but mostly inaccessible.
1,Irritating and disjointed.,"I was very disappointed in this album. Normally I thoroughly enjoy the work of Maurice Jarre; however, when I first listened to this soundtrack I thought there must be something wrong with my sound system. The rare moments of beauty, mainly provided by the vocal and instrumental versions of Unchained Melody, are totally overwhelmed by a cacophony of disjointed and irritating sounds. This was especially annoying since the strnge sounds always come after a brief moment of the very soothing love theme from the movie."
2,deceptive advertising,"This vendor's ad does not state what the size is of the product that you are ordering, and when the product arrives, it is half the size of the (same brand)comparable priced product."
2,Disappointed,"The bag contained a sampling of quilling papers (very short, no room for mistakes or practice) and a few poorly photocopied, inane instructions. There are no copyrights on the instructions, so who knows where they came from? You can buy more quilling paper for the money and find better instructions for free on the Internet. I will be more wary of these kinds of ""kits"" in the future."
5,A NOSTALGIC TRIP DOWN CLEVELAND SPORTS,"BOB DOLGAN DOES A GREAT JOB GIVING CLEVELAND SPORTS FANS A LOT OF MEMORIES IN THIS BOOK. HE SPENDS ANY WHERE FROM 2-6 PAGES GIVING US AN UPDATE ON MANY ATHLETES IN CLEVELAND HISTORY BOTH PRO AND NO PRO. FROM INDIANS, BROWNS, CAVS AND BARONS PLAYERS FROM 1940'S TO THE 1990'S. HE ALSO COVERS SOME LOCAL BOXERS, COACHES AND TRACK AND FIELD LEGENDS. ALL IN ALL THIS IS A GREAT READ FOR THOSE WHO HAVE FOLLOWED CLEVELAND SPORTS OVER MANY YEARS. MR DOLGAN HAS GIVEN THE READER A PLEATHURA OF GREAT STORIES, MEMORIES, INSIGHTS AND OPINIONS. MR DOLGAN RECENTLY RETIRED FROM BEING A SPORTS WRITER FROM THE CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER AFTER MANY YEARS OF SOME GREAT COLUMNS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL CLEVELAND SPORTS FANS AND FOR ALL NOSTALGIC READERS."
4,Under-rated,"If you like their other three records, particularly Positive Touch, you should have this. I bought it for .98 + shipping...wotta deal. Worth owning, and at that price it's free. Most people seem to like the pop/produced Motown-influcence hope-it's-a-hit stuff, but I prefer songs like ""Love Before Romance"". It almost reminds me of Big Star's 3rd. Beautiful and twisted, this is a weird record. The Ryco reissue also has some great extra tracks. Get it."
2,the art is the best part,I own this album and there are a couple good songs on it. He really shines in a group. I'm hoping that his new album has catchier beats.
5,Sometimes I Feel Like Running Away from Home...,"This book is terrific! I found it at a garage sale, of all places, but am so grateful I bought it on impulse. For any Christian woman, or mother, this book resonates like few others. It is sassy, humorous, insightful, and right on target. It has been a book I have routinely reread. I found it especially helpful to get through the early years with my children. Hope she keeps writing!"
4,A Stimulating Resource,"Volume II or ""The Ancient Near East"" is a good companion to Volume I, containing mythic, legal, and monumental information from the Middle East Bronze and Iron Ages. It really puts you back there to read actual letters and contracts, or to see the developments in poetic, narrative and visual arts. The only real problem is the lack of consistent dating infomation, particularly for the artwork. It makes it difficult to form a conceptual picture if things are presented in what appears to be a random order."
5,A must for kindergarten classrooms!,"This is an adorable book which will grab a child's attention from the beginning. I think this must become a staple for every kindergarten classroom. I was in public education at the kindergarten level. The lesson taught here on ""peer"" pressure, is a lesson that cannot be taught too early in a child's school career. The illustrations are wonderful too! Ms. Elliott and Ms. Munsinger, congratulations! You have done it again!"
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,I rented this movie back in the 90s. I could not believe how awful it was. Seemed like one long neverending scene.
1,Serious contender for worst film ever made,"Here is the premise for the entire movie . . . two pathetic people sit next to a trailer in a trailer park and complain about their lives to each other for 90% of the film. Then, the goofball husband lumbers over to the other side of the trailer park, gets it on with another woman and the hilarity escalates. That's it!! Camera quality is on par with footage produced on a $200 camcorder. The only redeeming quality is the blues soundtrack. Getting a tooth pulled without laughing gas was more fun than sitting through this."
2,Looks can be deceiving,"Do not buy this tool unless you will be laying out skirt boards for stairs that have less than a 7 7/8"" rise as this gauge will not adjust above that. Also, if the stair you are skirting happens to have more than a 1/2"" bow in the middle, it better have a 7 3/4"" or 7 5/8"" rise. With carewful modification I was able to elongate the slots for the parallel gauge to allow for use on a higher rise stair, but then the profile gauge they supply comes up short in the height department. Use of a 10"" profile gauge remedied that situation. Why the manufacturer would even sell a tool with such limited capacity is beyond me, as anyone involved in renovations of older homes knows that very seldom are you going to encounter less than an 8"" rise on a staircase(the exception being some old Victorians with 11 runs and 6 1/2"" rises which number 2 in my career). Maybe on the west coast things are different."
4,No more painful toes,They do their job which is keeping you from getting worse bunions. They do shrink over time so buy a couple of pairs. No problems thus far.
1,Didn't work for my bunions,"I find that these spacers create too much of a gap between my toes. The only thing the spacers appear to do is push over all of my smaller toes. It does nothing to move the big toe. My feet also felt very strained after wearing the spacers all day, so I discontinued using them. Since these are so cheap, it's worth a try for yourself, but I wouldn't recommend them."
1,Much larger than I anticipated,These are far larger than I anticipated and didn't fit for me. I found them to be uncomfortable and an unsuitable replacement for ones I had used for years.
3,"Eh, not effective for me","Got this to relieve pain at the end of the day and found that the spacers really didn't separate my toes enough to take pressure off. They were soft, but overall I just didn't see the benefits."
5,A must-have companion for the do-it-yourself investor,"This is a great book that delivers on its promise to teach the reader how to value stocks. The valuation process is broken down into easy-to-understand parts, then brought back together to determine final results. Using the tools in this book and the software, I can intelligently and quickly review stock recommendations from my broker or make picks myself. This book will more than pay for itself."
5,Excellent Book,"It is refreshing to see that someone is still talking about valuation. This book is top notch. It offers useful tools to use in stock valuation but explains them in plain english. As an investment professional, I try to read every book I can find on the subject of valuation. This is one of the best."
5,Seeing Stars and the People That Love Them,"What a wonderfully, powerful love story filled with spiritual transformation. The Sanatana's 35 year relationship is an unusual chronicle or friendship, love,family, and loyalty. I could not put it down; from the first page I was hooked! It filled my Sunday afternoon with such unexpected joy and elation... it has made me look at mo own relationship with an artist very, very differently. Now I can see with eyes of unconditional love and non-judgement and compassion and most of all... understanding."
5,Exciting,This is a exciting story about a boy who thinks he's a superhero who can breath under the ocean and swim with sharks even though he scared of them. It's also sad because of the father who's sick with something thats killing him. I especially liked the joke about Carters sisters big bra.
4,Another boring review,Sorry I couldn't resist. These bits are an old standby. They work great in soft materials like wood and plastic. Speedbor is very accurate. If you hit a nail they get dull fast but you can resharpen them. Even if you don't you're not out much. I know a lot of guys that use these for making custom bits. maybe they grind a taper on them for candle holders or they cut the shanks for stubby bits. The list goes on and on. I threw away my rack. I wrapped the bits in rubber bands so they would stay together. The whole bunch fits nicely in my Makita box. A must have item.
1,Defective lasagna pan.,"This pan was defective so I returned it, thank you Amazon for paying the postage. The first time I used the pan I oiled it, but noticed that my piece of paper towel turned black. I washed the pan again, oiled it again, more black. I discovered that the lengthwise seam along the raised section of the bottom of the pan was open - I could catch it with my fingernail, and the black was coming from this seam. Later I stopped by Macy's and looked at the same pan and discovered the same open seam. It looks like Cuisinart is selling a defective item on a large scale."
1,Pan is defective,"The pan looked great and is nice and heavy; however, exactly like another reviewer said, there is an unsealed seam in the bottom of the pan that gives off black stuff even after multiple washings. I was very disappointed. HOWEVER, Amazon was GREAT - very fast shipping, plus they paid return shipping because the item was defective."
5,Great Lasagna Pan,"great pan to use if you make alot of large Cassaroles.simple tip: spray nonstick on it prior to each use.makes cleanup a snap, and serving and cutting out the Lasagna a simple easy no problem solution. It comes with great recipes as well."
1,Not what i expected,"I received this pan as a gift for christmas. I always wanted a deeper pan to make lasagna in. The pan is heavy and deep and the handles are convenient. I was excited to use it for the first time and was extremely disappointed in the pans cooking performance. Lasagna, that i usually cook in other pans, took over 2 hours. Normally it takes me about an hour. I am using the same oven at the same temperature. I tried it cooking a pan of mexican hots with the same results, twice as long. The pan looks beautiful but its all show and slow go."
1,waste of time,"Don't let the title of this book fool you. This book is a waste of time. Has ideas, but is way short on details. You are better served spending your money elsewhere if you're tryin to learn about building cabinet doors and drawers."
1,Avoid the b&w version get Danny Proulx's Cabinet Doors and Drawers (Popular Woodworking),"This is a poor black and white representation of the book---Danny Proulx's Cabinet Doors and Drawers (Popular Woodworking) [Paperback],unfortunately I purchased both.Avoid this title building cabinet doors and drawers,get the original."
3,Building Cabinet Doors and Drawers,"If you want to see what kind of doors you CAN make, this book is not bad. If you are hoping to learn how to make a particular type of door, this book is not very informative. It lacks a lot of details that you'd need to know if you were going to actually make the door that the book describes."
4,The TRUTH,"I bought driver 2 because like others I like the original driver. This game is much better than that. It is not as easy to beat certain stages (there is alwasy that stage or two that takes a little extra effort). I even had to lower the cop difficulty just so I could complete the stage. The camera view on the multiplayer mode kind of lacks because you can'tuse the view where you actually see your car. Other than that everything is improved upon. Tanner is no the ""fleetest of foot"" but he moves fast enough. I mean he can't run as fast as the cars or anything. This review might be a little biased because I play it on the playstation2 and it reads the playstation games faster and also texture smoothing. You can tell a big difference with the buildings if you don't have the smoothing on."
1,Two thumbs down,"I did not find this game to be very exciting. Some of the levels are impossible and it seems like you have to restart 50 times before you can finally pass the level. How am I supposed to catch a guy throwing explosives out of the back when he never slows down enough so you can run him off the road? The cops seem to be difficult. You can be going full speed and the cops can still ram you from the back and send you flying into a building. I personally didn't think it was very fun. Now if you could walk into the buildings and explore a little more than pavement, it would be fun. If you want a game thats impossible and frustrating, try Driver 2."
3,Not Bad,"Not as good as the first one, but it's still considered a classic in my eyes. Love collecting these old games. One day, they will be gone, but I will keep mine safe no matter what."
3,Fast And Fun,A fast and fun game for older kids.Do to the violence I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids.
2,not a good game,"I thought this would be awesome, being able to get out of your car, multiplayer, and more.. but after about twenty minutes of play time, the crappy grahpics and other things started getting on my nerves. Then, not so long after that I saw gta 3 being played at a friends house (i got driver 2 a while ago as u can see). Even since then, I couldn't play driver 2 without thinking of how much better a game was out there, that you could do a thousand times more in. Of course, you have to get a ps2 to play gta 3, but trust me, it's worth it. Especially since gta vice city is coming out soon. Ps2 is definately the way to go."
4,Good,"This movie is good, but why do I keep crashing:I give it a ****(4 out of 5), since of the crashing."
4,"Driver2 is like graduating from ""Driver"".","First off, the game does slow down every once and a while; but I only noticed that after I had been playing it for about 6 hours. I guess my console was tired. Everything from ""Driver"" is here in Driver2. Plus, when your car gets too damaged, you can hop out and ""commandeer"" another, fresh, vehicle from a ""gracious"" citizen of Havana. With the game containing 2 disks there are more cinematic scenes and a lot more game to play through. I for one love the game, and the 2 player capability should make it a title you will take out over and over again. (I haven't had the chance to bash up someone else, but the L.A. police are fine for now)."
4,He is back in buisness,"This game is about a driver on the run,you can drive fast past police cars and get chased. Plus you can get out of the car.The game is designed for people aged 8 and over because of the great driving,its great for the family.There is no swearing so its O.K for younger children.I liked it because of all the fast driving and pinching other cars."
3,"The GTA3 of PS1, mabye","Driver 2 is a pretty good, well designed game that fits the same sort of steoriotype that GTA3 used. Except, Driver 2 has many, many, flaws. First of all, it's just to darn hard, some of these goals, like 'Stop The Truck' in Havena, were so nerve racking i didn't want to touch the game for months. Another flaw is that you cannot have any weapons, you cannot have any cheats to access all the cities, and you cannot really go much of anywhere except the same area of a city.Even with its MANY flaws, Driver 2 is still better than those early GTA's, isn't it? With a very challening Undercover mode, a Free Ride mode, and multi-player games with split screens, Driver 2 is a decent game for PS1 that will keep you occupied for a while."
2,Driver 2 on PS2,"I was hopeful in renting this game to try on my PS2 that the newer console would improve some of the graphics issues discussed in the other reviews. The bad news is that the graphics are just as bad on the PS2. The good news is that the control might be just a tad better. I did not notice any substantial control differences compared to the original Driver (which I also own and could do side by side comparisons to). My personal jury is still out on buying this one, but the experience was not as bad as the PS-based reviewers suggest. On PS2, the game still isn't pretty, but it doesn't make me want to throw the controller at the screen."
1,PC Version?,Where is the PC version of this game?????? I have cash and will pay -- really seems like a no brainer marketing decision needs to be made.
4,Very Good game,I love driver 2 my 14 year old friend bought it last year and he let me borrrow it I played it more then him I never beat the game but almost did using cheats My favorite part was taking different cars I liked the limos in Vegas best the cars look cool the places look realistic and the damage is realistic I like playing take a ride it's fun using all the different kinds of cars. like I said FUN FUN FUN buy it on EBAY AMAZON or EBGAMES.com
2,Do NOT buy this game,"This game has very little of the fun and innovation found in the first one. Roughly a third of the levels (almost all of the chase levels) are ludicrously difficult without remarkable skills, and the ""tail the suspect"" levels are boring and easy. You'll often replay the same level over and over again (they really can be difficult), and between each replay you have to wait for the level to load and watch a long intro. Experts may get something out of it, but it is no fun for casual play."
2,Bad Play,"Great concept, but if you don't mind the game play slowing you down because the playstation can't keep up (oh and by the way the person you are chasing doesn't slow down) then its a great game the will just frustrate the hell out of you."
4,Tanner's amazing quest,"I thought that Driver 2 was an amazing game.I also have Driver and didn't think you could better it,well i was wrong!!!The best bit is the mix with GTA when Tanner can get out of his car and steal others.A truely amazing game but isnt my top of the charts........?! WRESTLING is more my cup of tea!!"
5,"Awesome Game, Tons of Fun","I bought this game for my ps, played for 8 hours straight, and i still love this game. I think that if you like racing or action games, this is the one for you. If you liked Driver or GTA, quit reading here and order. If you haven't played those, i'll tell you more. You basically drive a car as fast as you can, all the while avoiding police cars, blockades, tailing other vehicles, and even stealing a few. This is the best game i have played since Team Fortress Classic for the pc.The action is fast-paced, nonstop, with a thumping 60's style soundtrack, and the sound effects are awesome.The only place that the game lacks is in the graphics category. The graphics could have been better, but, the action and speed well make up for it.Well, order the game, and enjoy the ride!"
3,The wheelman is back and he's uglier than ever,"Sure, this is a 32-bit game so the graphics won't be that hot, but boy is this game ugly. Infogrames should take lessons from Squaresoft on how to get the most out of the system (have you seen ""Vagrant Story""? You should). But at least this thing plays well. It's just like the first except now you can steal cars which really adds to the replay value. If looks don't matter to you, add this one to your list."
2,Disappointing,"Driver 1 is one of my all time favorite games so of course I went out and bought Driver 2 as soon as it came out. When I played it I couldn't believe that this was made by the same company that made the first outstanding game. The graphics are hardly impressive, the control is loose, the speed is sluggish and it's just not a user friendly game. At some points you end up hating the game because you have to restart so much each time you fail a mission. They made this game extremely hard. My friend is a gaming fanatic. He plays games all day everyday. He's an expert at them. But even he couldn't get past the first disc of this game. We've both given up. Now, if I'm going to play Driver 2 it's just for the free drives around the cities. I'm looking forward to a Driver 3 on Playstation 2 but I hope Infogrames will fix all the problems this sequel had."
2,[Insert title here],"An interesting game at first, but it gets boring after awhile because it seems like you just do the same thing."
4,Not bad,"Driver 2 is a good game. First of all, the idea of getting out of your car and stealing another is great. Also, the levels are huge. The graphics are ok, but nothing really special. During movie sequences, though, the graphics are good. Don't get fooled by it saying multiplayer, its not great. You can't get out of your car, there are no civilians and you can only play half of a level. But, in the end Driver 2 is a good game and I recommend it to anyone."
4,"Good, but not great","Driver 2 is one of the best games for psx. however when you're on foot people still run from you like they do when youre in a car. It is fun for the first 10 or so plays but gets boring. the best part is not missions but a joyride mode which describes itself. buildings do pop out from everywhere however youll get used to it. Some of the vehicals you can steal are: ambulances, fire trucks, police cars(find the unused one in each joyride level), school buses, armored tucks, crvs, pickups, hondas etc"
1,WRONG THREAD TYPE FOR 92 CIVIC,"THIS LOOKED EXACTLY RIGHT FOR MY 92 HONDA CIVIC DX W/AIR,BUT INTAKE THREAD TYPE WAS INCORRECT AND WOULDN'T CONNECT TO FUEL INTAKE LINE FROM TANK."
4,great buy,great investment in well written novels and recommend it to be a good addition to everyone library
2,Hard to read and understand,"Wuthering Heights was the only story I enjoyed, and even it's a difficult read. The Victorian language and references to a bygone era weren't so bad, it was the author trying to write in the local slang that was most difficult for me. I didn't enjoy it much at all, was very disappointed and bored throughout. I should have just got the one book from the library."
4,The Other Sister,"This book provides a wonderful compilation of five great Victorian novels. While Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights are well-known classics, many people are not aware of Charlotte's three other novels : Shirley, Vilette and the Professor. Shirley is my absolute favorite with its brilliantly satiric dialogue. As far as the Brontes go, Shirley is as close to being humorous as one can get. The reason I give this book four stars is because it is missing a key component: Anne Bronte. Although her talent is equivalent to that of her sisters, Anne Bronte has been unfairly marginalized as a writer. The addition of Anne's two novels Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall would truly encapsulate the essence of the close-knit Bronte sisters."
2,Not so complete,How could they not include Anne? It's almost as if they just threw in Emily just because Wuthering Heights happens to be so popular. They should have either put all of the sisters' works in or Charlotte's alone. The glass is half empty.
5,Way better than a neck strap,"I've used this hand strap on my Canon Rebel XT the last few months and absolutely love it. It's comfortable and once I'm strapped in, I never worry about dropping my camera. Just be careful and use common sense when walking around a crowded place with your camera strapped to your hand. This came in really handy on my trips to NYC and overseas as it allowed me to hang my video camera around my neck while my Canon was ready to shoot at any time. Great product!"
2,Strap too short,I have an average size man's hand and the strap that connects to the camera is too short. It barely fits through the buckle and keeps coming loose. Wrote to the company first about this but heard nothing back. Does not inspire confidence when using.
1,Camera Grip,Did not like this grip the Wrist wrap not easy to get on or off Buy hand Strap Instead of this one.
1,useless to me,"I was hoping for something to help me steady a camera for telephoto shots but misunderstood how this works -- I think some other reviews are misleading. I fail to understand how having something to put my hand though & and that I can't get my hand out of and that is like a stirrup on the right side of the camera is going to help. Plus it makes it hard to make adjustments for shutter speed, etc."
2,Broadway By The Book,"Very competent PBS style program. Very much the style, if not the level of Ken Burns documentaries. Julie Andrews is the hostess who is very proficient. The early episodes are pretty good, but by the end it is very commericial, pro-Disney (did they underwrite this?), modern Times Square ad for NYC tourism. I wish there were less movie clips, but we have to be glad to have anything. But, if you want passion, see ""Broadway: The Golden Age,"" which I saw in a movie theater and comes out on DVD soon. That one's the real thing."
5,WELL WORTH THE $$ SPENT!!,If you are a musical fan - this set is for you!! A wonderful history full of clips - an overview of Broadway's origin to now! Enjoy!
2,Enjoyable as an Educational Document,"This will probably be a valuable tool to educators through the years. I did not find it especially entertaining as it was very much ""by the book"" in the traditional PBS sense. I would have preferred that we had heard more from the actual people that were there rather than so many acaademics and relatives of those who it was about. Also, I know so many others have said it as well, but way too many movie clips and you never knew what you were looking at. People were not identified, etc. But, I applaud them for taking the time to make it and for putting it all down. Still better to have this than not to have done it.NOTE: I thoroughly enjoyed the extra interview footage. It is actually more entertaining and enlightening than the actual series. I wonder what they must still have and what they might have done with it?"
2,TOO MUCH HOLLYWOOD IN BROADWAY!,"This series is fine, I saw the six hours as a screener, but it is very ""movie-heavy"" which surprised me. I actually would prefer to hear the stories of the film ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" over the numerous movie clips of Broadway shows adapted by Hollywood. If you want movie clips see the Michael Feinstein Hollywood PBS series, which was wonderful. This one is a first-class production, very classy, but oddly enough it does not keep your interest the way the much more ""shoestring"" Golden Age film does. Perhaps this one was a bit too ambitous. But, it does look very elegant anyway."
4,Not PURE Broadway,Love anything about broadway? This is for you. Only objection is too many FILM clips of musicals and too many great shows and flops left out of even mention.
5,Essential!,"Julie Andrews narrates this fabulous collection of excerpts from Broadway shows and interviews with the greats - performers, producers and composers.If you love Broadway, this is essential viewing. There are other collections, too, but this is the longest and possibly best. You are given a truly complete run-down of what makes Broadway great."
5,For Broadway Fanatics,A great history of the musical theater. Brings to light many musicals I had forgotten about.The commentaries are enlightening. I highly recommend it.
4,An embarassment of riches indeed!,"The program sets out to cram 100+ years of Broadway history into 6 hours. This means the final hour covers 1980 to the present which (ironically) is a period when many shows were video-taped for TV and for the Broadway archive.I hope this set is a success and will prompt more in depth looks at some of today's creators. A full 2-hour show could be devoted to Kander & Ebb, another to Andrew Lloyd Webber, still another to Stephen Sondheim. Get these people now while (except for Fred Ebb) they are still around and active in the theatre.The Rodgers and Hammerstein shows were well covered in a 1980 PBS special hosted by Mary Martin..and THAT one should be exhumed and released on DVD.Still, what IS here is well assembled and presented but even with the 3-hours of bonus material, it still only scratches the surface."
1,For Grandmas,"There are 390 pages in this book and the main couple only gets 'romantic' on page 345. I hardly call that a romance, yet that is how this book is classified - as ""contemporary romance."" This book is very far from being contemporary, and I'm not really sure it's all that appealing to women in the younger set (a.k.a. 20s and 30s). This book reads as though my grandmother was telling it to me - it's a grandma romance. One of the main romantic characters in the book is a curmudgenly old guy age 87. Not romantic, not sexy, not something very appealing to read about. The characters are sedate, the action is slim to none, the characters are boring, the plot is weak, and the writing is drab and just... oldish. This book has no staying power - it doesn't involve you or make you want to remember the characters afterwards. I wouldn't recommend this book or any others by Woods, especially if you're a younger woman. The book doesn't capture the spirit of romance at all."
4,Stretching the Carpet Not the Truth,The Crain Cutter 500H Carpet Power Stretcher is a solid product. It makes stretching carpet easy. The adjustable head and adjustable foot allows you to stretch at odd angles. This is my first time laying carpet and this product made it a cinch.
2,unhappy customer,"It is shorter than all power stretchers I rented in the past. In discription lenght was not mentioned, wich is very important part of this tool. I assumed some standard lenght based on my many years of experiance from renting the same tool.also was shipped much later than originally promised"
3,"It works, but ...","This is not a pleasant tool to use. It is noisy, it vibrates excessively, and ergonomically, it is difficult to handle. The trigger position requires the use of the fourth or little finger. Because of the unusual gripping actions required, I developed a blister after less than 20 minutes of work.The key to success with this saw is to follow the enclosed directions and carefully establish a cutting slot that will then serve to stabilize the blade. (I found myself using a spare blade to manually saw the initial slot.) The suggestion to use a scrap of flooring stock as a base is absolutely obligatory - the saw jumps all over the place unless it is resting securely on a base.(The saw also damages the base material, so do not use good flooring material or completed flooring, as a base.)Despite these unpleasantries, the saw does a respectable job of sawing door jambs relatively quickly. I would never do the job manually if I had this saw available."
3,looked for this forever~,"I love the unique harmonies in this cd, but I can do without the cheesy overly exaggerated NY accents they use in a couple of their songs. It makes you just instantly turn it to the next song."
2,I don't get it?,"After reading all reviews about how great this CD was, it seemed a logical choice to go ahead and get it. Plus, I had heard We Three Kings on the radio and really liked it. But I gotta tell ya, that song was the high water mark. A couple of others are ok (anything from the Messiah is a plus) but not anything that would make me quickly hit the replay button. What turns so many folks on about this CD? It reminds me of listening to a Jr High School Choir.Certaining not one of my top Christmas CDs. It will probably find its way to the back wall of my CD case...to be played but some unsuspecting first time listener."
2,Thumbs Down,"I highly disagree with the other reviews written about this album. Contrary to the beliefs of the other reviewers, I found the music to be boring and unimaginative. To stand out in the over-crowded sea of Christmas albums, an artist needs to perform with a moving-passion or musical ingenuity, neither of which are represented in this album. In fact, the album is at times so cookie cutter, I swear I could hear the metronome ticking in the background. Thumbs down."
5,The best Christmas collection in my music library!,"The Roach sisters harmonize the old-fashioned way--beautifully. Each of the Christmas carols is performed reverently and is perfect for singing along. The traditional winter songs (e.g., Frosty the Snowman, Jingle Bells) are full of surprises and sheer whimsey, and occasionally the Roaches' New Jersey roots show through. The Roaches began their career singing carols on the street corner and this return to Memory Lane is definitely worth the trip. Their voices are fresh and young; their harmony and discord tight and exacting.Every year I buy extra copies to give as gifts to friends and family."
5,My Favorite Christmas CD,"This is The CD I play the day after Thanksgiving. The one I listen to as I decorate my tree. The one I listen to Christmas night after all the radio stations have stopped playing holiday music, after all the guests have gone home and the kids have gone to sleep, crashed on the sofa with a glass of wine in happy exhaustion. The one I couldn't have Christmas without. In a musically perfect world, this CD would be my generation's ""White Christmas."" Read the other reviews - I'm not alone."
1,WAS DAMAGED,"Ordered this for a gift, and thank goodness I opened it first. Had 2 quarter sized ""spots"" that were stiff and looked like the solvent used to clean the printing machine had dripped on the item. It bleed through both sides of the felt and ruined the printing on both sides. I am a great fan of Amazon, and order very often, but I sometimes get damaged goods. I wish they were better at quality control, both for themselves and their suppliers."
5,Fun and great price,Lots of fun. My children had a ball learning card games and using chips I bought separately. Something different for the kids but also fine for friendly adult card and table games.
4,"Good, but gets fuzz balls after a while","This isn't a bad felt, but after a while it does get the annoying fuzz balls. I've been using mine for over a year now. I stapled itto a piece of plywood for my home-made blackjack table and use it pretty frequently. After about 10 - 15 uses you start to get the fuzz balls and they can get in the way of cards sliding freely on the felt which is annoying.In the future I will buy a higher quality felt, but for the price this really is a good deal, and a good starter felt for at-home play."
3,What you pay is what you get,"This item came at a very competitive price and I decided to get it because it was also two-sided. The felt is not very good quality and when you fold it it tends to get folding lines.Good if you want to just have fun with family or close friends, but I'd buy something of better quality if I wanted to use it for more formal gatherings."
3,Decent Felt,As stated in previous reviews it comes folded up but the creases disappear upon rolling it up and out a couple times.However with light use I have noticed that the felt does tend to bundle up already. The cards tend to get caught up on them when dealing. This is a modest replacement to a real poker table but for light use it is acceptable. Also with the pricing it's not too bad if needed to be replaced.
3,Average at best,Comes wrinkled and already fuzzy out of the box. Only reason I would not give it less stars is because it is cheap. You can't expect a great product for the price.
5,Awesome black jack and Texas hold'em table cover,"I love this table cover. I use it weekly and have had no issues with it. It is thick enough to allow aggressive betting i.e. throwing chips across the table and not make much noise or scratch the table. However, there are some fuzz balls that have appeared, but I have expected that since it is made of felt. I don't find that a problem, where others may.Overall, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to use a table they already have but don't want to scratch it or buy a card table."
1,"Made with very thin tradeshow-purpose disposable ""rug""","My god... this is identical to the disposable rug/fabric we use for trade show. They are dirt cheap! The color of the actual product is actually a dark green, doesn't match the one in shown on amazon display. The printing quality is low. The hole thing is very very thin. I can't complain for $10 and free shipping but if I saw this at the store, I would save my $10 for better quality product. That's just my 2 cents."
3,THis is okay,Kind of expensive but okay b/c everything is overprice these days.I can make a better product that is all I can say. The white line is bulging andthat causing the cards to jam when sliding over it --annoying!!
1,Easily one of the most boring books I've ever read,"I picked this up on a recommendation from a friend who's into boxing. That's the last time I ever ask him for advice. I found in a used bookstore on a recent visit overseas to Prague.While its obvious Mr. Fried has knowledge. he doesn't know how craft a project that makes you want to keep turning the page. Its just information. His book has all the depth and warmth of the back of a trading card. He must have spent months putting this book together but to what end, a boring book.You want good boxing books try:Night Train. The Sonny Liston Story. By Nick ToschesAndFinnegan. Self Portrait of A Fighting Man. By Chris Finegan"
1,Pfaltzgraff Winterberry Vegetable Bowl - Disappointment,"Cheaply made, thick and heavy like most cheap clay bowls. I thought it would be along the line of fine china given the price but in this case, you do not get what you pay for. SAve your money and buy something else."
4,Ladies Pilgrim Leather Tote,"The tote is made of very thick, strong, soft leather. Don't be fooled by the picture. It has a snap on the upper portion of each end to give it that folded look at the top on each corner. If you unsnap it,it expands to be wider and has a few pockets inside for further orgainzation and a zipped outer pocket that I use for various power cords. I love it! It carries everything that I needed it for and is sturdy for the heavy items that I have. It also holds its shape.If you have very small hands, be aware that the handles are thick and padded. It was a very good value for the cost."
5,Love it,"The drive came with all the stuff needed except the 3 1/2"" to 5 1/4"" drive bay brackets. The disc clone software worked great, the partition software ""MaxBlast"" worked equally well and the cables came in both adapter type (for mating up with legacy power supplies) and newer SATA configured power supplies. The thing is FAST. I have used this drive for about 6 months and was looking to buy another one when I saw this review page.Do not be afraid.... this one works."
4,New HD,The drive worked right out of the box...the only problem was that windows xp had been installed on this supposedly new HD before I got it. Check to make sure the seal on the static bag has not been tampered with first.
3,a little disappointing.,"i used Pitch Blaque today for the first time. i was happy with the results after using it since i looked darker. i do have some complaints about it though. after i put it on when i was in the tanning bed, it felt like it was flaking off. also it says it has cooling in it but i never experienced the ""refreshing cooling sensation"". i bought the product for the cooling but never felt it. kind of disappointing."
1,not as good as the ad leads you to think,I was not happy with the results.The product doesn't deliver the tan it promises. I will not purchase this again.
5,Great Book!,"This book is about a 12 year old girl named Orphelia Bruce. She wants to be a star,but her mother won't let her perform anywhere except for in church.Orphelia's idol is coming to town to do a talent show named Madame Meritta.Orphelia can't perform because she had gotten into trouble earlier that day.So, Orphelia does what she has to do.That includes stowing away in in Madame's storage wagon.Pretty smart,huh? Anyway....oh, yes.She(Orphelia)gets to tag along with the show and even perform.She also unravles a secret to her family's past.LUCKY!!!!!!!"
4,Pretty good.,"This was my first listen to the Sim Redmond band, and I must say I'm impressed. The album has a unique and refreshing sound, if you enjoy reggae(ish) music i'd recommend picking this up it's worth an occasional listen."
1,not happy,I still have them in a box under my bed. They are not built well. I dont advise getting them.
4,Hopeful and refreshing,This CD would serve as a great introduction to Kerouac's work. The balance between spoken word and musical performance is near perfect and serves to show the timelessness of effective poetry.
3,"disregard tomorrow, yesterday....focus on now. now.","yes. these selected readings of kerouacs work reveres his brilliance.what a comfort it is to know that people of today respect and acknowledge the superb depth of kerouac's expertise. we are on the brink of a new beat era, a bohemian revival, if you will. delve into this album and acknowledge that there is more to the words than first thought. acknowledge, and know."
5,Ethereal beauties,"I use these glasses a lot, currently for all kinds of wine and champagne. They are very tall and slender, so I'm currently saving up for some burgundy glasses to match, but in the meantime, I'm quite happy drinking Cabernet from these glasses. They clean up just fine in the dishwasher, too (3 years and counting, not a scratch on them!) I rest the base of the glass on the little flip-down shelf on the top rack, and tilt the glass down to the next row. They're too tall to stand up straight, though.They are quite fragile (we've broken one so far), but that delicacy is one of the things we love most about them, so now we're more careful about not leaving them sitting on the counter while we're cooking in the kitchen - they go straight in the dishwasher when they're empty."

1,Not so hot!,"I bought this memory kit for my sons new pc i built for Christmas. I put them in and set it according to what I THOUGHT they were 800Mhz but they would not run at that speed. I had to slow them to 667Mhz to run stable. The number on the modoles did not show up anywhere in a search on google or at PNY site so that is a hint that they were not real PNY. If it were easier I would try to get my money back. The bubble plastic packaging did not seem to be ""normal"" either. Seemed to be put back together but that is my opinion/review. Wont buy memory atleast from online again...ever! =("
2,not with windows 7,Purchased this memory in a 2gb kit 2 units to use with windows 7 blue screen of death after a few minutes. Memory works with xp/32 2gb
1,Poor RMA from PNY,"Be warned. If you need to do an RMA with PNY for this memory you will not recieve the same memory back. I bought 8 of these memory kits and 2 failed just after 30 days. Trying to get PNY to issue an RMA was a major hassel. When they sent me the replacements they DID NOT come with the heat spreaders. When I called to complain they said they do not send the heat spreader models any more even though thats what I bought. After working my way up their supervisor chain I finally got someone who said they would send me the replacements with heat spreader. I sent in their RMA memory 30 days ago and still no returned memory. When I check their RMA Status webpage, it says ""Order being processed"". I will definately never buy any product from PNY ever again and will actively suggest to friends, family, and any one I help build a computer to never buy from them again."
2,"Good, as long as it works","No problems for about a year and a half...until my HP diagnostics detected a read/write failure. I contacted PNY for an RMA only to be told that they would stand behind their product, but I would have to send back the memory modules (all) and then they would determine if they would replace them. Lacking a network of computers, I can't give up my computer while they decide whether or not to send me the replacements.This is, in my opinion, a clever way of side-stepping their commitment to replace defective products. For me, the cost of replacing memory is less than the value of constant computer availability. Obviously, my next memory purchase won't be from PNY."
2,Defective DIMM,"This product failed as it warmed up to operating tempererature. The warmer it got, the worse it got. It took me some time to figure out it didn't work when warm. I of course tested it immediately after installation using the BIOS memory diagnostics and everything was fine. Then later my system started failing, going to the dreaded blue screen (Windows 7 Pro 64-bit) and automatically rebooting. I knew the only thing I had changed was the new DIMMs so I shutdown and removed and reinstalled, tested again. Of course it had cooled down by then and tested fine. I actually had to restore my hard drive from my server backup. I finally calmed down and thought it through, tested the memory, let it warm up, some problems, warmed up completely, system would not boot all the way without blue screen and restart, tested again using BIOS diagnostics and it failed first test. Removed DIMMs, restored system AGAIN, and everything works fine."
1,Didn't Load Windows 7 = BSOD,"Right after building my system, these DIMMs caused a BSOD ""blue screen of death"" condition, issue occurred on both WXP and WIN7 installs. I chose the DIMMs when I saw that customers that bought the GA-G31-ES2L Gigabyte motherboard, routinely purchase these DIMMs as well (Per Amazon), however it was not a good mix in my case. It was frustrating to troubleshoot, since all the HDW was new, but after going over the other reviews, I did notice another person had problems loading WIN 7 as well. I went to Fry's and bought Kingston DIMMs instead, no problems after that."
3,Good,Good stuff that should be enough to say without all this required junk. Buy it if you need it otherwise get something else
2,Hey. We're your audience. Please care.,"In the late 70s, I had a conversation with a fellow Keith Jarrett fan, but this guy was hardcore. I mentioned some obnoxious thing Jarrett had said in an interview and this fan said, ""Oh, yeah, well, I try not to pay any attention to anything he SAYS.""I'm going to have to go with the appraisal of this collection as being largely self-indulgent. I think it is flawed in concept. We all know that, for the most part, Jarrett did some preparation for his best solo concerts and improvised on themes. This idea of sitting down with nothing and just playing: That might be an interesting exercise for the musician, but it come close to being an insult to a paying audience (attending a concert or buying a recording.) I've played ""Radiance"" three or four times and there's not much here that grabs me. It would have been better if it was half as long. I'll eventually pull out the best of these pieces and burn a single CD."
2,Wishing Keith Jarrett back to 1979,"It is every artist's privilege to change. I cannot deny that right to Keith Jarrett - but that does not mean I must like it. Let me say that I LOVED him after listening to his Koln and Vienna concerts. He is at his absolute best when he's on his own - composing on the fly, as it were. Unfortunately, in this double album, ""Radiance"" - there is only a faint hint of his past solo concerts and startling improvisational abilities. [...]"
1,buyer beware.,"Seemingly devoid of any melodic content or structural coherence, Radiance is a ""love it or hate it"" type of work. I find myself in the latter camp. (as apparently also did most of the Japanese audience). If you are expecting something along the lines of the recent The melody at night with you, or even the overhyped Koln Concert, this may not be your cup of tea. If you are looking for a truly awe inspiring musical experience, you are better off getting Jarrett's 6 disc At the Blue Note collection...boring standards to some, but at least they won't leave you scratching your head in confusion."
1,Nonsensical,"Unfortunately we are likely to hear a ""sampling"" of the laughable pretentiousness of the jazz crowd. We will hear that this is a great album because it's ""challenging."" We will hear them compliment it because they know most people will not be able to sit through this, which makes it anti-pop, which makes it good, right? It's not challenging, it's unlistenable nonsense with no structure or noticeable direction. Even in admiration for Jarrett's boldness in the attempt, which I have, that should in no way lead to the contention that this is a good album.Then again, if you're one of those people who liked Captain Beefheart's oddities or think that simply not sounding like things you've heard before is preferable to actually ENJOYING your listening experience then this is the album for you."
3,informative but rather silly and fake,A good video other than being a little silly and acting is rather fake.My kids enjoyed it more than me.
3,unstable,This is a very usefull tool but it needs bracing to keep it squared up.If it racks kickback results from the mitresaw.
2,Poor quality control,"Rousseau has to get their quality control improved. I received one of their 2875 miter saw stands today. Assembly was simple enough except for the casters. 3 had hard rubber rollers , the 4th was hard plastic, had a different locking mechanism, and had a shaft 3/8"" shorter than the others which caused the whole assembly to rock. I fixed the problem by adding some extra washers onto the shaft. But, I think after spending almost $500 on this product it should come with all the correct parts. Not impressed"
4,Great stand but . . .,"Have been using my 2875XL for 12 years now and it's a very good stand. BUT, I had to put 2 30# weights on the bottom shelf as it tends to be top heavy especially when attempting to move (roll it) it. Just a safety tip."
2,Not worth the money,"This unit is over rated and its not built very strong. The directions that come with it are so general that to put it together and not get it done right too a few hours. I was very displeased when it came and If it would not be for the fact that I would have to pay to have a piece of junk sent back, I would have returned it. There are many tables out there that are cheeper and better so shop around and buy in store so you don't get what I got. A pain in my you know what!!!!"
1,The Title Belies This Book's Veracity,"The author should very well know -- Divine Revelation ended with the Resurrection of Christ. There is no more ""Divine Revelation"" other than that at His Second Coming. Therefore, I need not even consider reading this trash.If we (or anyone else) do/does not believe Christ, why would we (or they) believe this author? Frankly, I think the author is having a good laugh for herself. That, or she is deluded."
1,Where is the 0 stars option?,"Oh please. This is a sorry excuse for a book. Give me a break. It actually makes me laugh. Sort of like that Holy blonde bimbo on television with the 10 pounds of makeup who cries and whines all day about Jesus knows what. LOL So since this author is so HOLY, did she give all of her profits to charities or did she pamper herself? Do not buy this book if you want to stay sane. If you do buy it, make sure you call your nearest looney bin before reading it. Jerry Falwell, eat your heart out..."
2,Don't know how to describe,Don't really believe anyone has gone to Hell to come back and tell. Was sort of scary. Not impressed. Just read your Bible and that is best.
5,Easy Read,"I enjoyed it, and I know that the author has to keep repeating what she wants the reader to catch in their mind. I just felt that it was a little bit of an over kill every few paragraphs the same thing. I passed it on."
4,A Divine Revelation of Hell,A Divine Revelation of Hell is very descriptive! It gives the reader an idea of exactly what hell is like and no one wants to burn forever.
1,"Disgusting, unscriptural HERESY!!!!","What a blasphemous work of fiction! It's too bad many Christians have no idea that this pagan idea of hell is 100%unscriptural.This woman has no idea what Gehenna, Sheol, Hades, and the lake of fire are nor their purpose. Christian teaching has jumbled all of these different concepts together and created it into Dante's pagan inferno (or Mary Baxters) to control through fear.This woman is a lying heretic and a false prophet. She peddles false doctrine for money. There is not a shred of scriptural truth in this demonic rubbish."
5,Bible Believer,"So many people want to knock this book and Heaven Is So Real, and declare that they are Bible Believing Christians.Yet they defame Jesus, defame the authors, fail to read correctly what is written and so create false statements about the books'So please would be readers, read the book without making stupid judgments.Jesus is alive today, and He has not changed.He said of Himself 'I am the same yesterday,today and forever, I never change'. He heals today, He delivers today, He saves today. No changes, God is not dead."
5,Great Read!,"This book is really easy to read, the print is medium text size and easy to follow.. Whether you believe this story happened or not the moral of the story is trust in Jesus always and repent your sins daily. Her trip to hell could be possibly real or it couldn't. But if you don't believe Jesus guided her through hell this doesn't mean you shouldn't read it.. Great book to anybody who wants to add to there library.."
1,Beware,"Beware of these Authors, Rebecca Brown M.D., Baxter, Jack T. Chick. They are using Mind Control on those who read their Documents.In Love and Light"
1,False and Perverse Twist of God's Word,"Anyone who is tempted to believe this woman's story needs to get very acquainted with scripture and they will be able to see the contradictions and the just plain made up stories that are not true. She contradicts the very nature and personality of Christ, whom you can learn about in scripture. Why does she have such a need to be so special that God would choose her? He doesn't choose people for things like this, that also contradicts scripture. She is either an unabashed liar or a nut. Avoid this book. It is heresy!"
3,Not that good.,This book is a modern attempt at Dante's Inferno except Mary Baxter tries to scare you into christianity. The author claims that Jesus came to her in a set of dreams and takes her into the dark paces of hell. Whether this is true or not I cant say but I can say her writing Isn't very good. A lot of the people she encounters in hell and there stories are repetitive.
