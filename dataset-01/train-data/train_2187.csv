3,Worked for me but digs into wrist,"I would have given this 4 stars if the edges were softer. The edges are rough and dig into your skin. As far as nausea, it worked for me on the cruise we bought it for but questionable for other users in our family. They weren't convinced if it worked for them."
5,Item received quickly,Brand new. Quick delivery. Will tell you how the item worked after I get back from my cruise in the end of September. Thanks for great service.
1,Somethings wrong with video???,"The video ""freezes"", while the audio continues, also the picture goes ""green"" (partially) while watching.... I love the movie but you need a new copy.... I watched it twice to make certain it was not the internet connection..... It had the same problems each time... Don't waste your money, until issues are fixed...."
5,National Geographic's The Secret Leopard,This VHS tape arrived on time and in excellent condition. I don't think this documentary comes in DVD form. but it didn't matter because the quality was very good.It's so interesting to see how each wild preditor has its own personality and how sweet and playful they are with their cubs.
3,Still Ticking After All These Years,"This is one of the few early volumes in this series that still has some usefulness. It is as comprehensive as the knowledge of the times allowed in the 70s and was written by a veteran of the war. It does not attempt too much coverage and thus still stands.Osprey has let many of the early titles aimed at the military miniature market stock deplete and go out of print. Deservably so.This one has been recently made available again in a facsimile edition. Although some twenty plus years old it is still useful.According to the other listings on this site a whole new edition is coming out covering the period from the conquest of Manchuria to 1945. As the original author was a mature man and a serving soldier in the war, if he is not deceased he is certainly retired by now."
2,If there's another way...look for it,I installed it November 2004 and it's July 2007 and broken. I lost audio to my right side speakers and I traced the problem to this adapter. 3 weeks prior my other Turk adapter which connects from the amp to the radio also broke. It turns out it was a cold solder but I repaired it and it's now fine. As far as this one is concerned; I HATE it! It's wonderful that these adapters make it simple but it's nothing but headaches afterwards. If I find another way to install the XM I will try it. Sorry to say it but it SUCKS!
5,Haiku Handbook,"This is not for the passive haiku reader. It provides an in-depth history of haiku, samples of old masters and new. It teaches how to read, write, and teach... just like the cover says.I'd always wondered why my haiku seemed so long and filled with so much extra words even though I followed the 5-7-5 and 5-7-5-7-7 syllable format. This wonderful guide covers this and many other assumptions that we English-speaking haiku enthusiasts have about traditional haiku.My haiku has improved by writing in 3-6-3 syllables. (This book does not recommend 3-6-3, but it works for me based on the context of info provided) Anyone shocked at something other than 5-7-5 should not read this. If you enjoy reading and writing haiku and you learn what this book teaches, you will feel like a haiku master.Some of my best haiku was written as a direct inspiration of this book."
5,"The Subtitle Says It All: How to Write, Teach, and Appreciate Haiku","I finished the Haiku Handbook last week and loved it; I've written more haiku in the past couple of weeks than I had in the past decade--and far better haiku, at that! Wonderful book! Very inspirational."
1,Junk,"Bought this for use in my garage. I'm not a pro that requires ridiculous precision, but don't want angle finder that has a needle that STICKS. Opened this thing up today very excited to get to work, but now disappointed because every few times I use it, the needle hangs up in the previous angle measurement position. The needle will return to correct position if you tap the outside casing, but what if i forget to do that one time and ruin a piece of metal or wood?Can't trust it, its going in the trash. Just ordered the Johnson version hoping for better results. I reviewed the Swanson site and thought I was supporting American manufacturing. Wrong, MADE IN CHINA."
5,Rhonda,"I love Lisa Jackson, every book is a good one.I pick one up and don't put them down until it is all read."
2,WHAT A LET DOWN,I'VE READ SEVERAL OF LISA JACKSONS BOOKS AND I'VE LOVE THEM ALL. TWICE KISSED WAS A BIG LET DOWN. I COULD NOT GET INTO THE BOOK AND I GAVE IT AWAY WITHOUT COMPLETING IT.
2,Not Impressed,"After reading her collaboration with Wendy Corsi Staub and Beverly Barton, I decided to give Lisa Jackson's solo work a try. I was not impressed.The writing was way too dramatic and theatric for the story. I also thought there was an awful lot of filler and found myself skimming a good portion of the book.I may try another one by this author because I've heard good things...but this one was a definite disappointment."
1,What?,"I had a very hard time following the story line in this novel. The ""good"" twin - ""evil"" twin plot is just worn out. The long suffering Maggie goes to rescue her twin, MT, even though MT has done nothing but make Maggie's life hell. Along with Maggie is her long-lost love and MT's ex-husband Thane - it doesn't make any sense. Why would she go off with someone she hates and doesn't trust??? And then there's Maggie's brat of a daughter; a complete and utter nasty little twit. I had a hard time believing that Lisa Jackson wrote this book. I've always really enjoyed her stuff - not this time - what a waste of $6.99"
2,"Writing OK...Annoying, Lame Premise","Classic tale of the manipulative twin sister: 1 good, 1 evil. Evil disappears after making the good one's life hell all their lives...including stealing her one true love who naturally sleeps with the twin sister after drinking a little too much. Evil sister has manipulated and ruined the lives of others for decades, but when she disappears, the Good sister heroically rushes off to find her at all costs. I really hated the 'evil' sister and the way the hero was so easily manipulated. She forgives him fast enough, though. I guess 'true love' is weak after all...a sad lesson to learn from a romance novel. The only 'twin sister' story element missing was the good sister impersonating sexy evil sister."
2,"Not my cup of tea. Yawn, yawn. Could barely finish it.",I expected more of a fast-paced action thriller. What I got was a ton of teenage characterization & the lovers' not very romantic baggage. Give this a skip.
1,Trees had to die for this to be printed?!,"It's outrageous what kind of garbage gets printed these days. Clichèd after clichèd phrases, just really bad and bland writing. Character that don't act in believable ways. Has this writer ever heard of knowing the character? I don't not finish books often, but this one I had to give up on. I was just absolutely disappointed at all the cliches and the characters."
1,"Borrow it, don't buy it","I picked this book up on a whim after reading the back cover and the first few pages. I agree with another review who stated the back cover was misleading in to letting you think that Maggie would ""turn into"" Marquise. After the first few chapters it became predictable and then just greedy and silly. One other reviewer said she couldn't put this down; well I had a hard time picking it up after I got started.If you feel the need to read this book then borrow it from someone. It's not terrible but it's not worth it."
2,BORING,"This book was terrible. First of all one twin married the others boyfriend. How gross is that?? I love to read and rarely do I not finish a book, this one was the exception. I gave up about half way into it. Save your money."
3,Mouse trouble,The first one went bad after about a week. Had a hard time explaining to the rep that it wasn't working. It would not scroll and the software did not work to change any of the actions of the buttons and the scroll wheel. Was told that I would get a new one in about 15 days. A month went by and I had to call again. They apologized and said the unit had been backordered. No message about that to me! The one that they sent works OK as long as the software is set to default. I am piloting a Mac with OS 10.4.8. I think that Kensington has not tested this with a Mac.
5,Awesome! Creative and Original.,"If I had to make a comparison to another band, I would choose The California Guitar Trio, the reason being that both bands pick the same genres for their eclectic and sophisticated compositions. If CGT decided to go full flesh, this is what they might sound like. That said, this a thouroughly enjoyable album with full orchestral arrangements, varying styles, changing meters, and expertly written compositions that move in unexpected directions, without ever losing their cohesiveness. Sometimes very light and carnival-like and sometimes quite heavy, the album has surprises at every turn. Not sure I understand the concept of the album, but it's supported by the booklet, where nice black and white photographs tell the story. A true gem, sure to be appreciated by progressive rock fans, and perhaps the even the afficionados of the avant-garde, you know - those who wear dark glasses and black clothes at all times :-). Enjoy!"
5,"Not cheap, comprehensive 1cd","Fine band,great songs.Quite good,comprehensive 1cd compilation.The best 1cd Association compilation?Price is rather high, but there is 20 tracks in this cd.(in fact, 2cd anthology is better purchase)All the essential hits.No booklet and not very much information about band history on the cd's cover (and language is French).This is digipak.Tracklist(years/composers) is ok and there is bandmembers names/pictures."
3,Poor sound great group!!,What happen to the remastering in this cd???the sound is poor to say the least!!they could of payed a better tribute to a great group like the Association.we fans deserve better than this!!i recommend the Essentials which is remastered!!
4,You Gotta Be A Romantic...,"...or a sucker for love songs done well to get into The Association.Forget about that pretentious ""Requiem for the Masses"" and that blatant attempt to cash in on the Summer of Love, ""Enter the Young"". Listen to those ballads. You know which ones...How can you not find ""What makes you think love will end when you know that my whole life depends on you?"" compelling...? Or ""I'm beginning to think that man has never found the words that could make you want me..."" something you wished you'd said to your woman? Co'mon! You gotta listen and feel what the dudes are singing about...The lyrics, the harmonies, the great Bones Howe (and the Wrecking Crew) production are the ingredients to these great ballads which always capture my attention. And I ain't necessarily one who waxes nostalgic over evry Oldies jam I hear. I like what I like. And a good song is a good song....well, mebbe like I've said elsewhere, I am a fool for great tunes..."
3,"not bad, but...","if you're an aging boomer looking for a quick trip down memory lane, go for it. but if you hunger for a thicker slice of one of the most under-rated pop groups of all time, pick up the import collection of their greatest hits -- if only because it contains the original version of ""enter the young."" the version on this disc is a lame re-mix that fails to capture the driving energy of the original -- a song that led off side one of this group's terrific, but mysteriously-out-of-print first album, ""along comes...the association."""
3,"Most of their good songs, but not good tracks","This cd had most of the association's good work on it but I feel that many of the tracks were of a poorer quality than I have heard before, say, on the 'Along Comes the Association' album. This latter album(cd) is what I would have ordered instead, had it been available. After listening to 'Greatest Hits', I wish I would have waited! I was ready to set up my old turntable again!"
3,Ow! My Sweet Tooth,"As pop music goes, it doesn't get much more sugary than The Association, who cranked out a series of syupy hits at a time when bands like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones were taking the music in exactly the opposite direction. That doesn't mean they weren't any good, however. As Sweedish popsters Abba would so clearly demonstrate in the next decade, great songwriting can make even the most cloying sentimentality palatable.That said, ""The Associations Greatest Hits"" really only soars on the genuine hits. ""Windy,"" ""Cherish,"" ""Never My Love,"" and ""Along Comes Mary,"" were all smash singles and are still staples of oldies radio today. Unfortunately, the rest of the songs lack the strong hooks that propel the singles and are mostly forgettable. Overall though, this CD is reasonably priced enough to be worthwhile if you want to own those hits."
4,Very solid group,this is not my favirote group that would go to The Beatles. However this group has very good harmony and plain out good solid music. Wendy and Never my love are great songs and so is Cherish. GodBless
4,Classic forever,"Listening to this group brought back memories of my childhood, this is one of the first groups that listened to when I was 12 yrs old. As a matter of fact Cherish will always be one of my all time favs. This is a must get for us 60's bunch, 1960's that is not 60 years old ."
5,Excellent Sixties Pop!,"I thoroughly enjoy this album. Only about half of the songs were true ""hits,"" and some of those were only minor hits, but it doesn't matter. All of the songs work together nicely and are a pleasure to listen to again and again. One gets the impression that the group really enjoyed making the music. If you like 60's pop, this is a keeper! I saw the group perform live in 86, and they put on a good show. I've never heard any of the group's other albums, but this has got to be the best of the bunch, as well it should. Finally, I liked having the lyrics on the CD sleeve (cassette version doesn't have them--not sure about vinyl) so I could finally make out what's being sung on ""Along Comes Mary""--a classic tune."
5,Timeless,"This music still holds up and I listen to it nearly every day. The Association was a great band and some of the songs on it that got very little airplay at the time, are my favorites. Great music, great group, great cd!"
3,The Association's Greatest Hits,"What a piece of schlock, but it's lovely schlock. This will remind you of the innocence of the 60s. It's a shame that this might still be the best representation of this group. This isn't a great collection but about half of it is a blockbuster. My favorites are ""Everything That Touches You"", ""Never my Love"", ""Cherish"", ""Windy"" & ""Six Man Band"". To me, these songs make owning this album worthwhile."
4,A memory of my youth,"While there are a handful of songs on this CD that are obscure (to me at least); the Cd as a whole is a fine representation of the Association's multi layered ""soft rock"" sound. Songs like ""Cherish"" ""Never My love"" and ""Everything That Touches You"" take my back to the ""puppy loves"" of my youth. And who can listen to ""Along Comes Mary"" or the group's biggest hit ""Windy"", without gaining a spring to their step. This is a feelgood CD and a must have for collectors of sixties rock."
4,Not Nearly Enough,"I'll say what everyone else has been saying-- Why, oh WHY, are this band's first seven studio albums (as well as Russ Giguere's fine solo album) not in print? The Association has clearly been neglected-- not only by their label but also the voting committee for the rock'n'roll hall of fame, who have mysteriously never nominated this group whose recordings have been played OVER TEN MILLION TIMES!This hits package is adequate, but if you haven't heard ""One Too Many Mornings"", ""Looking Glass"", ""Pandora's Golden Heebie Jeebies"", ""Goodbye Forever"", ""Dubuque Blues"" or ""Silver Morning"" (none of which are included here) you are sadly missing out on some of the GREATEST POP SONGS OF ALL TIME. At the very least, we should demand an updated greatest hits anthology that's AT LEAST 74 minutes long."
4,Good Source of Catholic Apologetics,"Fr. Lukefahr provides the reader with a solid and modern look at the Catholic faith in this 200 page book. Covering topics as broad as the Bible in Catholic theology, sacraments and sacramentals, the Communion of Saints, the Church and science, the Reformation and potentially sticky wickets such as the topic of ""limbo"", the book provides the reader - Catholic or non-Catholic, with an approachable and digestible overview of Catholic faith and dogma. This book should probably be read by anyone who IS Catholic, is converting to Catholicism, or wants to ""take on"" Catholic theology in debate. I would actually most strongly recommend it to the ""staunchest"" Catholic apologists - lay and clergy. I would suspect that some of your arguments for and about your faith will be modified, and your mind opened to a faith that is broader and more inclusive than you probably argue, believe or teach. Worth reading."
2,Read very carefully,"The way that this item was presented was very confussing and I ended up ordering the wrong book. What I needed was the manual not the work book, so now I have two workbooks and only one manual. I made the mistake but maybe the way they were presented, both books look very much alike."
1,Wrong Item,"This listing is for the WORKBOOK, not the actual paperback. It is useless without the actual book. It is also overpriced, when purchased it was $4.95, but the workbook's price from the publisher is listed as $2.95. Make sure you are ordering the correct item."
3,This pillow versus the Sonoma pillow??,"Buy the Sonoma pillow. Yes, this is less expensive, but the Sonoma lavender pillow is just better in every way."
5,I Highly Recommend Access 2000 Essentials Advanced,"This book is very clearly written and easy to follow. I consider it quite a find as it was the about only Advanced Access 2000 book written in a tutorial format that [website] had.(I'm presently studying the other tutorial Access 2000 book, Access 2000 Essentials Intermediate, which I also recommend.)"
1,Missing teaching diskette,"The other 2 titles in this series include a teaching diskette, this had none so I returned it to you. I followed your pricedures for returns, getting a RMA on line. I returned it using the shipping label. I have never heard back from you.So this is my last time dealing with Amazon for anything.What a ripofff!!!Pete Swoger"
4,Mumbo Jumbo,This book is full of lots of technical information that help understand the program to its fulliest extend. There is a large array of information that left me wit ha better understanding and a clearer view. This book is great for quick lookups and quality information. This book doesn't leave my side when I am at the office.
3,Can not treansfer video from Panasonic mini DV cam to iMac,"I got the Belkin tape, and connected my Panasonic DV600 mini-tape digital Video-camera to my iMac. The computer would not recognize the camera.Panasonic lists only Windows software for that camera, the Apple website offers no drivers for this camera. I have no reason to fault the cable, but it is useless to me."
3,works but with limitations,"My fault for buying firewire 800 instead of 400 port external harddrive. That said, tried to compensate by buying this cable to free up some usb ports. Cable works, however, throughput is a lot slower than just using the usb cable. Also, the usb ports on the external hard-drive are also not responding as well. Went back to using usb cable instead."
1,Should have bought the Firewire 400 to 800 adapter instead!,"I have an old Sony camcorder, the DCR PC115 and bought this cable because my new iMac does not have a firewire 400 input. It only has a firewire 800 input. After connecting the camcorder to the iMac I opened iMovie and tried to upload video from the camcorder. I found, to my disappointement, that the signal was not being sent.Good thing I had also purchased the Sonnet firewire 400 to 800 adapter. I connected the Sonnet adapter to the original cable that came with the camera and the signal reached the computer with no problem.I'll keep this Belkin firewire 800 cable for possible use with a future video camera... although the newer camera's use SD memory cards, right? So, it looks like I wasted my money on this cable :("
3,to big for a thin pocket pc,I think its a good product with good materials but it's big for the ipaq 1900 series. I also have a HP jornada 545 and the case is perfect for that big pocket pc. Maybe targus can do another small case.!!!.
4,Campy Classic B Movie,"This movie is SO bad it's good. Basically, this group of 4 or 5 Valley Girls (that term alone dates the movie) sell fake cocaine to save an orphanage. During the course of the film they end up at frat parties, a horse race, driving around, and finally end up in jail. The acting is so terrible, it makes me cringe -- so without trying to be humorous the actors do so just by their lack of talent. A must see if you grew up in LA during the 80s. Let's hope you didn't act like them."
4,Good movie.,I haven't seen this movie since it was on 'ON TV' back in 1980 - I still think it's a good movie and I'm just a middle aged honky.
2,"Too slow,,,,,,,,,","slow, offkey, tried to show the life in East L A....but a little differant than that, acting was very good though...."
5,its a Classic,A must have on my collection. Excellent film. Thanks I received it quickly... Dvd is great. I recommend it to everyone.
5,Bld Night,"Authentic and purpose. Great cars, vonderful actors! Very very intense and trajic history but its life on sud L.A.I have recommanded urgency.Excuse me for the language approximary"
1,Boulevard Nights,"I wasn't satify with my movie of Boulevard Nights. It was not an original copy of the movie. It was a bad burn copy of the movie. Keep in mind that all original movie are copied onto silver color on the bottom of the disc. If the color below is purple and it's a burn copy not an original. The picture quality on the movie sucks as well. There's a lot of dark screens, but don't take my word on it. If you want you can see for yourself."
3,Boulevard Nights,"Somewhat amateurish and with a predictable storyline. In contrast, I thought La Mission was well-done and an excellent depiction of low-rider culture."
5,Boulevard NIghts DVD,"This movie embodies the Latin American (Hispanic) culture in California back in the days. I'm guessing it is set in the 1970s but I could be wrong. All the cars and businesses on the strip that appear in the movie appear to be the actual city and actual cars and not a studio set or replica vehicles. It is a very good drama/action movie. It delves deep into the Mexican American culture that exists in lower California. Highly recommended. Has cuss words, gangs and violence to name a few Rated R features in this flick."
3,"BEWARE, not the best quality","beware the quality on this ""official"" release. It may have produced in a large quantity by somebody calling themselves a factory, but the artwork is a grainy photocopy, and the DVD itself is just a VHS transfer with some sort of contrast filter ran on it. It is NOT digitially remastered and it is not widescreen. There are no bonuses or features. About the only thing that makes it worhtwhile is it takes less space than a VHS, there are chapter breakdowns, and it will not degrade like a VHS will.BUT, we still need a QUALITY OFFICIAL FACTORY release!"
1,A lot of bootlegs out there,"Only buy this DVD ""new""....I was unfortunate to buy ""used"" and it had a purple side. I should have known better because of another review."
1,blvd. nights DVD,"i was sad when that dvd did not work in any player i had. it only worked in my lap top. i love this movie and the viewing of the movie looks like it was a recording. it is just sad, sad,sad."
3,Disappointed,I didn't get what I ordered. The color didn't match the picture and I have no way of knowing if the wrong item was sent (I ordered bone and the color was peach) or my eyes are just bad. There was an area of bad stitching along the top border of one set where raw material was sticking out.I didn't remove them from the packaging so I can't comment further on their quality.
5,Made me want to be an Astro-cat!,"This book is so wonderful for children because it stimulates their imaginations to the fullest extent! In this book they get to be Flyball (the SpaceCat) and travel to places unknown and be the hero! In this book a child can be an explorer, a scientist, the savior and still meet the kitty of his dreams! The book is great. It was printed before any of the lunar landings, but the imagination involved will still enthrall children."
5,Very Well Done,"I found this book in the special archives section at my university, and was very impressed. This book is clear, well thought out, and beautifully presented. If you are at all interested in this medium, buy this book."
5,Elements of Pop up,"This book goes wildly beyond my expectations. No only does it show diagrams for the pop up methods being described, there are also examples of each device so they can be examined three-dimensionally. The techniques are also not found in other books (that I know of)."
5,The Elements of Pop-Up,"Finally: A how-to book on pop-up engineering with REAL pop-ups for examples! Not only is this a how-to book for budding paper engineers, it is a pop-up collectible in itself. Authored and designed by two of today's outstanding engineers, it demonstrates with clear instructions and graphic examples (which dramatically rise from the page) the various means by which the magicians of pop-up technology achieve their almost-magical effects. This is a book for all ages, to learn from but also simply to enjoy."
5,This is a good book for aspiring paper engineers and artists,I am the author of this book. I created this project because children and teachers often asked for my recommendation for a how-to-make-pop-ups book. I hope it inspires young creative minds of all ages to experiment with paper. Have fun!
5,My first dead purchase.,"When I was a little grade school boy, before hundreds of dead tapes and discs had passed through my hands, this was the first grateful dead tape I ever purchased. I basically just took a stab in the dark, and I was not disappointed. I wore the writing off the sides of it I listened to it so much and couldn't tell which side was which, but it didn't matter because both sides are equally pleasing. Now, after losing the tape, I've just repurchased the album on cd. This version of Wharf Rat is worth the album cost alone. But if you're not satisfied with that, Bertha, Mama Tried, Bobby McGee and NFA/GDTRFB will surely meet your listening needs. I can't believe I've gone this long without reacquiring, and am giddy at the thought of having it again."
4,Balanced Styles,"This is a very good album which explores the many different styles of this classic band. Jerry, Bobby, and Pig Pen all have their time on lead vocals and each have strong moments. The re-working of Not Fade Away is just great as Bobby's vocals and Jerry's guitar bring the song to new heights not acheived on previous versions. Then the jam and the intro to Going Down The Road Feeling Bad just sounds so darn creative. Bertha is performed with such spirit that you tend to overlook Jerry's technical flaws in the vocal department. The feeling he puts into the song overides any moments that he wavers off key. Me And Bobbie McKee is another finely reworked cover with some excellent drum work by Bill Kreutzman. The Other One is a bit dull in spots but otherwise this is fine recording of the band at its best, which is Live In Concert."
5,Very good sequel!...,"This book is awesome, and a great pass-by sequel to Volume one! I think everyone who read volume one, to read volume two! I heard there is going to be 8 in the series!"
3,Not as good,I loved the first book so i got this one. This book was not aproppet for what age groups it is for. I thought this book was a disapointment to the auther and the first book.
5,Mama Mia!,"The Princess in the Spotlight is a fiction/fantasy and is a very ""up to date, modern, real life"" book. I can relate to the book in some ways; but some of it is a once in a lifetime thing. For example, finding out that you are a Princess in some far, far, away land. But at the same time it keeps the ""down to earth"" quality that is throughout the book.Meg Cabot, is the writer of many different books, including the Princess Diaries Series. Including, The Princess Diaries, Princess in the Spotlight, Princess in Love, Princess in Waiting, and the Princess Lessons. She also wrote All American Girl which is also about a girl inheriting the throne. Currently, Meg Cabot lives in New York with her husband and her one-eyed cat.I would recommend this book to girls that are around 11-13 or 14, and some yonger girls would also probably be interested in this, except some or the words are hard to understand, but it would not be too hard."
4,GREAT READ!!,Princess in the Spotlight is a GREAT book!! i Loved reading this book i couldent put it down. I finshed this book in about 3 days. This is a book that I think every teenage girl should read. Mia is a very wonderful person i love her chacther in this book she shows so much courage and is the type of person that dosent care about what other people think of how she dresses or acts she is her own person.
3,A Great Book for Girls,"Princess in the Spotlight is a very well rounded book. It has humor, adventure, and romance. There were a ton of awesome points in this book, but the reason I couldn't put it down was because it was really easy to relate too. Let's face it were all not princesses but we all have real life situations that are in this book. I think Meg Cabot did a good job writing this book."
5,WOW!!!,The Princess Diaries #2 is awesome! It keeps you interested because Mia seems never to have enough problems! (haha) meg cabot is awesome. she writes like an actual teenager and it's SO GOOD! do all of u meg cabot-lovers know that she is coming out with 3 new books this fall 2002 and spring 2003?
1,Not A Good Book,THIS BOOK IS SO FAKE!!!! I thought the first one was okay but I hated this one. And I think the book was not appropriate for kids.
1,Disgusting,"My ten-year old daughter brought this book home from her school library. After I showed the principal the text on page five he pulled the book from the school and destroyed it. If you'd let your daughter watch an episode of Jerry Springer and call it educational television, then this is the book for you. Not only is the story pathetically lame (to the point of boredom) and chock-full of neurotic characters, the author has filled page after page with filth. I'd love to print what you'll actually see in the book, but am afraid they wouldn't be able to post my review."
3,A book For The Princess In You,"This book is the Sequal to the first Princess Diaries novel. Mia THermopoplis (16) has just been pronounced Princess Of Genovia, and she is currently the heir to her Grandmothers thrown. Having just come from living in San Francisco, CA, she has no idea on how she should behave, act, or prepare for her one-day rein. In this novel, her grandmother, along with other etiquette teachers try to help Mia become who she is destined to be, a woman, a royal, and ontop of it all, a Princess.I enjoyed the book, and was intriqued by its way of writing - a journal. However, I felt that the book could have been ""spiced up"" and , although it had a good plot, was written a bit dull."
1,NOT FOR YOUNG ADULTS.,The content of this book deals with Adult problems. To say this book is recommended for a Young Adult is missleading. I would not recommend this book to any reader under the age of 17 years.I bought this book as gift for my daughter of 13 years and found it to be not appropriat. Very Dissappointed.
1,Crude,"While Princess in the Spotlight is a well-written, somewhat interesting story, I will not give it to my 9 year old to read. I haven't decided about whether I'll toss it into the trash or donate it to the library. It's an entertaining, light read. The characters are quite flat and the plot is predictable, but if you want something mindless for a blue day, you'll probably enjoy this one.Princess Mia isn't terribly bright, and I'm not talking about her algebra grades. She does strike me as the perfect stereotype of a thoughtless and crude teenage girl. Fortunately, not all teenage girls fit this cookie cutter. If you would prefer that your daughter not conform to the dubious ""norm"", I would not recommend this book. It can hardly be considered a classic, and there are much better uses for her time."
4,"A fun, light read","This book was cute but incredibly unrealistic. I mean, a princess? One that appears on TV and everything?*SPOILER ALERT*The secret admirer thing was cute, but it totally couldn't have been Michael. I'm suprised that Mia didn't figure that earlier either. It kind of disappointed me a little bit at the end because Mia hooked up with Kenny. He's seems sweet, but she doesn't like him! The whole thing with Hank and Lilly, and he being an aspiring model was not necessary, in my opinion. I suppose it might have been some light-hearted humor or something. It also kind of pissed me off how, IN THE END, Michael complimented Mia, you know, after she said 'yes' to Kenny. God, what's wrong with boys...some are too shy and some are too arrogant.Overall, 'Princess in the Spotlight' is a quick, easy read if you're looking for and entertaining, enjoyable book."
2,"Self-centered, intolerable Princess Mia","I have a soft spot for good young adult fiction and this is not it. I cannot understand the popularity of this series. Mia is not just self-centered and whiny, but she is incredibly judgmental of everyone around her, including her mother and best friend. She seems to be stuck in one gear: complain and tear everyone else down. She comes across as a brat to the core in a way that has nothing to do with being a princess! I agree with other reviewers who said that the soapy drama and focus on emerging sexuality are not appropriate for 10 year olds--and this book came home from an elementary classroom. Disappointing."
4,Great Sequel to 1st Book!!!,The first one was great (very different from movie in a good way ) and I just had to read the second! In this one Mia is getting a little used to beng a princess and is developing an even major crush on her best friend's brother! I can't wait to get my hands on the second! Read it!
4,COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a great book for younger readers I really enjoyed this book Mia is so funny.This is like reading a note from a friend. I think it is a well thought out book. I think many others will enjoy this book.
5,Princess in the Spotlight,Princess in the Spotlight is a very good book that I would reccomend to anyone.
5,Great Sequel!!,"Fifteen-year-old Mia Thermopolis is just trying to stay normal...like she ever will be again. In this contiunation of her last diary Mia is just settling down from the aftershocks of getting the news that she is the lone heir to the throne of Genovia, a small European country. However she isn't done with shocks yet. (...)The second diary of Mia was another hit for me and should be for anyone who liked the first one. However I think the first one was just a tiny bit better than this one! I am just really attracted to Mia's sassy humor and all the normal teenage problems she gets. (Such as boys, her changing body, popularity, and school) Another great diary from Mia. Can't wait for her next one! Hope she and Micheal get together:)"
4,My O Mia!,"Mia is back and she is really excited to be an older sister! She is not too excited about her algebra teacher being the father of her sibling to be... nor is she too excited about her mother partaken of who knows what carcinogens in meat and beer and who knows what else. Doesn't she know she should stick with items like tofu?! Mia also is not too thrilled that she spilled the beans regarding her mother and her algebra teacher on a national interview. In the process, she might have sent one of her friends to boarding school in New Hampshire as well as making several people made at her. But as Mia will tell you... being a princess is not easy... especially when her grandmere insists on staging a wedding fit for royalty for her mother. Meanwhile, Mia keeps on getting notes from a secret admirer who thinks she is the Josiest girl in the school. What is Mia to do?This book was even better than volume one! Congratulations to Meg Cabot for this work... I look forward to the next one!Crazy James"
4,Great sequel!,"This was a great sequel to Princess Diaries. I now own both of them. What happens when Mia's mom gets pregnant with her algebra teacher? And what happens when Mia has to do a live interview on TV? What's going on with Mia and Michael? Read this book to find out! I truly recomend this book to the reader, who is into reading about another person's worries or troubles, or just the Princess Diaries fan! READ THIS BOOK!!"
5,The hilarious sequel to The Princess Diaries.,"Mia Thermopolis does not have an easy life. She's the princess of Genovia, her mother is married to her Algebra teacher, and her rival Lana didn't get any better. And someone out there has been sending her letters -- someone who won't say who he is -- and the mystery deepens as Mia tries to figure out who the secret admirer is. But things go awry for her when she reveals a secret over the air -- a big family secret. But it seems that more mischief is about to follow, because Mia is about to go through a lot more than she thinks. Is her high school life ruined forever? The Princess Diaries Volume II: Princess In The Spotlight is a hilarious and unfailingly funny sequel to Meg Cabot's The Princess Diaries, and was a lot more enjoyable than its predeccor. I can't wait for the third volume to be released."
3,Book two...,"The plot of this book was pretty dry. Just when you think it's getting interesting, it gets a bit dull again. I would only recommend this book if you want to read the others in the series and be able to understand them."
4,good and hysterical::~~,In this book Mia is discovering a life as Princess Amelia Mignonette Grimaldi Thermopolis Renaldo can feel like a right-royal muddle. It's more of a sequel of the 1st book of the princess diaries. Mia is still in America training to be a princess. I gave this book a 4 because after watching the movie by Disney it turned out to be more confusing ang less hysterical.
3,A little dissapointed,"Overall the book is in good condition. But it was sold to me as ""like new"" and although the cover looks new there is some highlighting in the book. A like new book should not have highlighting."
3,issues with the kindle version,"I purchased this book via the Kindle. The book itself has good content and is easily readable. My issue with the kindle version is that it didn't translate the text well. The printed text has many boxed off portions I believe. What will happen is that they get cut off on my kindle. I can get the content of these ""boxed"" portions if I turn the audio on and listen to it, but it will not show up fully on my kindle screen. Because these boxes are all throughout the text, it is very frustration to try to read this text on the Kindle. I love the kindle for its convenience and for taking notes in the text (and also for there being just one less book entering my book-full house!) and was looking forward to having a textbook on my kindle. I would not recommend the Kindle version of this book though."
3,Thought I would love it...,"...but unfortunately, the seam above one of the nursing openings has split after its very first wash. I was all game to buy both colours until that happened. :("
3,Depends on personal taste,As far as the music goes it's okay. I'm sad to say that I was more intrigued with them before I ordered the CD. I simply fell out of love with them.BUT as far as the quality and the shipping goes- the CD came in good condition and with fast speed.
5,Maria Muldaur virtuoso songstress!,"Maria Muldaur has the sweetest voice I've ever heard! Her virtuoso phrasing and tone change are pure delight. Tunes of special note on this album include: Midnight at the Oasis, Don't You Make me High (Don't You Feel My Leg) and Three Dollar Bill."
5,Be nice to yourself,"If you like acoustic country blues you'll love this Cd.I first ran accross the album in it's vinyl form back in the 1970'sI looked for quite sometime before I found the cd version of it.And everyone I have played the album for has went out and got their own copy of it.So do yourself a favor.One other thing you might want to look at her Richland Wowman and Sweet Lovin' Ol Soul albums and according to the liner notes of the Sweet Lovin' cd there will be one more album in this trilogy called Naughty,Bawdy & Blue"
5,a true classic,this has been one of my all time favorite albums that ive had on vinyl since it first came out. i now can play it in my car and was impressed how good the cd sounds. Very happy with my purchase
4,excellent,"Who could blame a Maria Muldaur neophite who just got this album for ""Midnight At The Oasis."" If there is hierarchy of 1970s pop with, say, Donnie and Marie and Debbie Boone at the bottom and Steely Dan and Roberta Flack at the top, Steely and Roberta would be standing on Maria's shoulders.""Midnight at The Oasis"" is the perfect blend of soft but edgy, poppy but jazzy that made some glossy 70s radio music top of the heap. But you may be suprised that a lot of the music on this album is New Orleans based, having a high end club sound. ""Oasis"" was released as the single for obvious reasons, but the rest of this music is as well done if a little differant in approach.I am struck by the flutter in Muldaur's voice--normally such would bother me--but Muldaur understands the setting she is in and plays, making her singing a tease for the listener. It comes off with humor, and she is fully aware of this.Excellent"
3,Maria's dare,"There are plenty of Maria's 1rst LP/CD reviews that swing towards her beginnings w/Jim Kweskin Jug Band and folk start, her one-time husband Jim Muldaur and his own edge in recorded folk history. Good Gracious!, a book could be written about the cult ..but anyway that is another story..I first heard this LP/(CD) in a record store 1974 while I was flipping through the racks and had a couple of bucks that wanted to burn to something new. At that time, record stores got LPs like radio, play it , they'll buy it. I wandered around and heard the LP and bought it on a whim. Whattyada think? In two weeks I was playing for friends and then!""Midnight at the Oasis"" jumped out as a huge hit. Maria's vocal is sweet and fine, but it's Amos Garrett's guitar solo so sweet so perfect that makes it embodied DNA.Other songs on the LP/(CD) begin the top 40 emergence of Linda Ronstadt, with Dolly Parton covers, and early rock.A fine LP/(CD) '70s treasure"
4,The Best Critique,"This is the best critique of Open Theism on the market today. Frame confronts the idea that God does not know the future exhaustively with a thorough biblical overview on relevant passages pertaining to God's sovereignty. Making his case from the Bible he avoids the pitfalls of name-calling, stereotyping, and alarmism by simply showing the ideas put forth by open theists to be contrary to well established biblical doctrines.However, the book is different in that it does not deal extensively with issues within the realm of omniscience, but more or less refutes libertarian free will. Thus, it acknowledges at least in practice that the watershed issue in the debate is over free will, not omniscience. John Sanders would at least feel some vindication in this regard.Nevertheless, the book is accessible and thoughtful and helped convert this reader from open theist to classical Augustinianism."
3,Wilson Philips sings Fleetwood Mac.,"Basically, it's their attempt at singing the songs made great by Fleetwood Mac. It's a brave attempt and they don't quite pull it off, but their harmony is still amazing. I like it because I like Wilson Philips, but it's not for everyone. The 30 second musical ""bites"" should tell you if you'll like it. (If you're an average fan of Wilson Philips save your money.)"
3,Gone Another Way,"Sometimes, comebacks really don't seem to be all that they are cracked up to be. When I heard that Wilson Phillips was going to reunite, I really was excited. Unfortunately, when I heard the comeback song, it just really didn't get to me. The remake of Fleetwood Mac's legendary hit, Go Your Own Way, is a very much simple version of the song, that seems more like it is stripped down the way Stevie Nicks and company would perform it. This version of the 70's song really doesn't have what I thought of it, to make it a suggestive single. Although Wendy, Carnie & Chyna do have great taste in songs, it is a mixed bag here. Otherwise, try going back to Fleetwood Mac's version, for longtime fans here."
3,Good Songs - Only Two of Them,"I enjoyed the songs, but I didn't realize there were only two songs on the CD. I didn't pay more than just a few dollars, so the value is very good. I guess I just wasn't very clear on the fact it's more like a single. I'll have to read better next time. Overall, I think I still would have purchased the CD even if I did realize it had just the two songs."
3,Too pricy for what it is.,This camera is large and not very eye catching. Image quality is not any better than camera 1/2 its price. Cannot comment on this low light ability bacause my locations are not too dark. I am using it for the wide angle. Not recommended.
1,teddy.p,i bought one of this cameras for its night specs.I have to say that this camera is no good at all for night vision.Read more review's and belive them when it comes to night view.DO NOT BUY IT IF YOU ARE IN NEED FOR NIGHT WATCH.Try Q-see 48030.It is the best for day and night.Good luck.
1,How Dare YOU!!!,"How dare you claim this is glass!!!. The shades are made from PVC plastic. The lamp itself looks nice HAD it been made out of glass, which was what I was looking for. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!"
5,Beautiful,"I just received this CD and it really brought back memories.Of course, back in the day I had the vinyl version of this album and loved it but I sold all my albums years ago and haven't heard this for at least 20 years.Anyway, the digital remastering of this CD is first rate and the sound is excellent.The original songs sound better than they ever did before.The live ""bonus"" tracks are so-so, ranging from off-key noodling to nice renditions of songs on the album.Overall, a landmark album that belongs in every collection."
2,The Lawrence Welk Show of rock,"Over-arranged tasteless pseudo-jazz/soul/rock schlock. This was my favorite album, age 15. Wow--it does not stand the test of time. Al Kooper had soul and Child is Father to the Man--this album's predecessor--really holds up well. The man was and is a genius.This stuff. Phooweee... Bobby Columby and Jim Fielder give textbook examples of how to over-play the rhythm section into a kind of twitchy oblivion. Nothing swings. And the arrangements: Jarring lurches from style to style with no feeling whatsoever for the music--except to show off....and David Clayton Thomas. Whiter than the Lennon Sisters."
2,Disappointed,"I just bought the Single Version that is supposed to have the guitar solo in it, however, they are selling the ""album version"" of this song as the single version. So needless to say I am a bit miffed. Do not buy the single version if you are expecting to get what you payed for. Grrrr!"
1,"Stale, contrived, lifeless","One of the most 'orchestrated', least soulful horn albums ever recorded. Critic's review on this page says it all. Want good horns, soul/rock? Try Sons of Champlin or even the Flock, if you're adventurous. This album is a dog. I warned you."
4,"B,S. & ....a musician's opinion......by Max","Blood, Sweat, and Tears ""Greatest hits"" album is very embedded in my memory. In 1969 I was 22 yrs. old. I had always played music since the fourth grade and when I heard this album when I was in the Army at that time.....It floored me. ""You Made Me so Very Happy"", undoubtedly was their most memorable song...what sweet minor seventh chords their keyboardist used! Also...""Spinning Wheel"".....and ""When I die""...closely follow suit. David Clayton/Thomas was certainly a good choice for vocal replacement of another member...Kooper. Even though other great groups as Chicago and Chase were competing with them, BS&T held their own!"
5,Stunning SACD release from MFSL,"I own about 100 sacd discs and this is one of the best I have. This disc from MFSL is a stereo only mix though that is not a minus at all. The sense of sound imaging in two channels is breathtakingly three dimensional with gorgeous instrument separation and fullness of sound. If you're at all a fan of this album and have SACD capability, this is a must have. Smiling Phases, More and More and Spinning Wheel are amazing renditions that rival the versions on vinyl. If you're into SACD and love Blood, Sweat & Tears this should be on the top of your choices to purchase."
1,riding the painted pony until i find what goes up,"This is one of the worst pieces of audio that I have ever heard in my life. ""Ride the painted pony""...what the hell are they thinking? The insert calls it a ""brash and exciting wedding of jazz and rock""...I call it a harsh and painful wedding of poo and pee. Between the carnival music and choppy wanna-be funk, this seems like music made by retards for retards. I mean, really, are these guys an Oompa-loompa band or what? Blood, Sweat and Tears should start calling themselves, Terrible, Horrible and Miserable. They suck."
5,A Legend,"This album has probably turned more kids on to jazz than any other in history. In 1969, I remember my junior high band director going nuts over it. For a bunch of kids trying to play ""Wipe Out"" and ""Proud Mary"", we were blown away. Years later, some two-bit critic thinks they ruined ""God Bless The Child."" That's like trying to say Chuck Berry ruined Beethoven's music when he sang ""Roll Over Beethoven."" Which proves an old saying - Those who can do...Those who can't, critique. This album will be around long after your work turns to dust."
5,Great Switcher.,"My DLP TV only has one HDMI input and I needed 3. I use it to switch a HD satellite box, an upconverting DVD player and an XBOX360 Elite. This product works great. It works wonderfully with my Logitech Harmony 880 remote too! This was actually the default switcher in the logitech software.Highly recommended if you only need 3 inputs."
5,Belkin HDMI Switcher,"Everything you read out there tells you that you need not spend lots of money on HDMI cables or switch boxes and that a digital signal is all or nothing - sorta. Well, that's bogus! I have a 720P projector with a DVI-I input connected to a cheap Magnavox Blu-ray player and a Dish Network over the air DVR all via HDMI. I tried cheap hdmi cables and a cheap switcher I got from Walmart. I had digital drop off problems. My run is 16 feet from the switcher and 4 feet to the switcher from the sources. The fix? Belkin Pure AV Silver HDMI cables and Belkin Pure AV 3 to 1 switcher. No more devices not 'handshaking' and no more digital 'sparklies'.Yes folks, the answer was to spend a little more money for quality. May not be your home theater set up and therefore may not be your fix or maybe it could have been fixed another way cheaper. BUT it was my fix & I am done. I can start enjoying my home theater. Time is money. Thank you Belkin. Job done - as advertised!"
2,No longer functional,"Maybe I got a lemon, but the remote stopped working after 2 months of use. It worked great until then. Hopefully you guys have better luck."
2,A Different View,"I am going to have to disagree with most of the reviews. Even though Mr. Tyler's erotica has explicit details, the book read like a list of sexual acts instead of a sensual poetic expression of feeling. I felt no connection to the writer or the subject of the poetry. I think most of the women who enjoyed the book so much, have met Mr. Tyler personally. These ladies would probably agree that he is fine with a capital F, and that fact adds to their appreciation of his poetry more than its literary value."
5,EVERY BOOKSHELF MUST HAVE A COPY !,"I have just recently began to appreciate poetry.I am a college student at Florida A&M University and there are plenty of talented poets who publish poetry of love in our school newspaper. So when Mr.Tyler's book was introduced to me, it was a must that I purchase it. The words, the passion behind those words left me breathless and often times speechless. It was hard to decide on a favorite but I did it. Did You Like? I recited it to a friend on Valentine's Day and well, let's just say I think I'm in there! The appearance of the book is impressive in itself. The satin bookmark, the elegant calling card, the rose petals ! OH MY GOD...maybe that was a secret. oopps! I wish I had space to share all of my feelings about this book but I don't. I can only make a suggestion, BUY THE BOOK !"
4,"Passionate, sensuous, & sweet ..................",Adjectives that breathe life into this collection of poetry...Mr. Tyler brings all the senses together to spark the readers imagination. Each page creates a new vision to behold and savor. Like a fine wine or painting...Thanks for giving your audience a place to escape.
3,A Journey through the mind of love,This book of peotry is a rare work where we get to hear a Black man tell us of his love for his woman. As an African American woman it was thrilling and inspirational to read such moving words of passion and love. I completely enjoyed Vincent Tylers work and reccomend it to all those sisters out there that are a little hungry to hear words of praise and sensuality from their Black men.
5,I Thought About You Today,"He's got me thinking or should I say dreaming! I definitely recommend this book. There's not a woman alive who can't be touched, aroused, courted or romanced by the words so deliciously written in I.T.A.Y.T. Its not just erotica, the pages are filled with wonderful words describing the beauty in women intellectually, emotionally and physically.For those of you in the dark you may need to set the mood a little bit. When you're in the need for a little romance, light yourself some candles, get a glass of wine, put on relaxing music and allow your self to be touched by Vincent Tyler. If you 're looking for a snack, I recommend ""Chocolate Cookies"". If you're looking for a real treat you should HEAR HIM READ.."
4,A Sensual Caress For Your Mind,"Vincent Tyler speaks with the words of a man who knows what it takes to please a woman! The journey can be quit pleasurable for us women if we are open to being taken to the secret places we thought existed only in our minds.And for you brothers who may read this review, take note, apply what you read and see if it makes a difference."
5,I Thought....,"A Definite must for all women . Get a glass of wine, get in a bubble bath using your favorite scent, settle back and relax and enjoy a sensous journey provided by a live, alive, pleasure fulfilling man. Read what you wish your man would put into words. Its nice to know a man thinks about the pleasure he can give a woman and validates women in their sexuality and beauty. Men should read and learn, their fanatasies can come true by emulating Mr. Tyler"
5,exellent product,As a wonderful alternative to insure healty lifeslyle and diet -this is a wonderful aid to accomplish peace of mind-to a natural balance
1,How would you buy this?,"If you needed a DVD to tell you how to get online, how would you be able to buy it from amazon.com? I can see the internal monologue on this one.""If I could just get online, I could buy a DVD to teach me how to get online. If I just get my hands on a DVD to teach me how to get online, I could buy a DVD to teach me how to get online.""This is a Catch-22 for our modern world."
3,Plausible? PLAUSIBLE??,"I have to laugh at all the reviewers who start out claiming that the premise of the story is plausible, before larding up their reviews with caveats. The story as told by Cook is only plausible in an alternate universe where The Maestro and Helicopter Ben were never born. Cook obviously gave Atlas Shrugged a mere cursory skim, as he tries to convince us that in times of financial stress, the elites will adhere to rules, and even principles. My goodness, they even care about the dollar in his story. I would be amenable to living in Cook's bizarro world where losers take their lumps and kleptocracy wasn't the order of the day, but unfortunately we both have to live in this reality instead. In the novel's favor, it was readable enough to finish instead of throwing aside for meatier fare."
1,"Shallow characters, thin plot,, poor grammar, a real yawner","This book was primarily an essay preaching Mr. Cook's doom and gloom view of the economy, using the pretense of a fictional novel. Character development was poor to non-existent. Grammar and punctuation was poor, and dialog was choppy and shallow. Many little vignettes with characters and situations totally unrelated to the rest of the ""story"" were included for some reason, but they did nothing to bolster the story line.Don't waste your time."
2,Not worth the money,"The plot was plausible and interesting, even if breezily carried along. The editting left something to be desired and the writing was only one step above Larry Burkett's fiction attempts on economic collapse. I did not care for the shallow attempts to fill out characters by having them swear or describing their lewd stares at women's body parts - I started to view it as a sophmoric writing assignment. The main gist of the plot was good, and entertaining; it was just cluttered with faults and lapses in writing ability. I'd spend $8 on a paperback version if it were available, but $23 was way too much. A much better fiction account, with far better character and plot development, on an economic collapse is Rawles' ""Patriots : Surviving the Coming Collapse"" for $13."
5,Great Accessory For Olympus Digital SLR's,"I've got one each for my C2500L and D600L. The back pocket (zipper) holds 4 smartmedia cards in plastic cases plus remote (for C2500L). The side pocket (velcro) easily holds 4 AA batteries, and as many as 8 snugly. Nice soft leather, looks and feels good and sturdy. The only negative is the fact when you take the camera out of the case, either it has to be held separately, or hangs from the camera strap (there's a snap on one side to secure case to camera strap)...I prefer the former, just holding in left hand while working camera with right, or putting it under left arm."
5,"A beautiful doll, perhaps best from a distance","I bought this for my 6-year-old, and I think I would recommend that as the youngest age for this doll, as she is as fragile as she is beautiful. We all loved the layered-crinoline costume, the rooted eyelashes, the cascading ringlets, and the legs/feet in correct ballet position, but even with careful play the crinoline eventually shreds a bit, and the feet break off very easily and cannot be repaired.Even with no feet (!) this doll is still one of my daughters' favorites."
3,It works.,"The voice gateway works as advertised, except it busy's out my regular phone line when using Skype so I can't get another call while using it. They do not make it obvious to us Americans how to dial. For other countries maybe they are used to dialing country codes. IF YOU ARE IN THE USA, DIAL 001 THEN THE AREA CODE THEN THE NUMBER because the Skype Gateway does not know what country you are in."
5,Great Reading about a Great Battle,"After I took the book one day in the evening, I couldn't stop reading it until completion the following night. That's the first virtue of the book: Barbero delivers a catchy, well done writting, like Tuchman at her best. Then, from a more scholarly point of view, he gives also multitude of details and assestments, not in abstract but in the flow of the narrative, that is to say, of the battle itself. With all that you get a full picture -perhaps ""the"" full picture- beyond the myths of novels, movies and leyends. Great, satisfying reading."
4,Worthy Addition,"In America Gettysburg gets the attention but in Europe Waterloo is The Battle. What does an Italian bring to this somewhat overemphasized battle? A view from the ""other side of the hill,"" the other participants. By this I mean the non-English who fought there. To the benefits thus accrued that others have mentioned, I will add that you will learn why La Haye Sainte fell and that a number of popular quotes and events are probably legend. I think a few maps of the smaller battles going on within Waterloo would have helped. In a few places the problem of translations appears but it reads well overall."
5,Great book!,"This is a wonderful book about Waterloo. I really enjoyed the differing viewpoints from survivors and the quotes. This was very well researched but not dry at all. It's imminently readable.. Napoleon, Blucher, and Wellington are quoted but so is the sergeant or lowly lieutenant. Thoroughly recommended..."
4,WATERLOO REVISITED,"I have read several books about the battle. This book is a great review of the events of the day. I found a few things that were new. The role of the Prince of Orange is an example. I believe that there is a benefit to having another (other than British) point of view. I always believed that Napolean's use of the Old Guard at the end of the day was an act of desperation,but this presents that attack in a different light. I understand the battle much more thoroughly after reading this and I recommend the book."
3,Kindle edition does not have maps!,"While I have not yet finished, I would agree with most of the positive reviews. However, I would recommend against purchasing this as a Kindle ebook. While the Table of Contents lists and includes links to a host of illustrations and maps, there is nothing when you follow the link, but the name of the map or illustration. In a book about a single battle, the absence of any maps is appalling. If you are serious about this book, buy the print edition or get it from a library (which is what I am going to do, so I can have the maps when I finish it)."
5,Excellent,"In this refreshing new history, Mr. Barbero finds the perfect balance between the lugubrious detail and sketchy summaries that often plague other accounts of the great battle. Polished prose, a refined style and new information and insights contribute to the understanding of this unique engagement and the enjoyment of the book.In addition to providing a clear summary of the tactics and movements of the opposing forces, Mr. Barbero adds enough eyewitness testimony to convey some of the feel of the Napoleonic battlefield.I have studied several accounts of the battle of Waterloo but have an enhanced appreciation of the event after reading this recent addition to the literature. Highly recommended."
3,Well-researched but choppily narrated chronicle of Waterloo,"The author Barbero appears to have done a terrific job of research on the pivotal battle of Waterloo; lots of colorful contemporaneous accounts are quoted throughout the book. Also kudos to whoever translated the book into English from the original Italian. Barbero gives the Prussians a more prominent, and apparently more accurate, role in the battle than in other histories of Waterloo. He teases out some new insights on the battle (at least new to a non-specialist), particularly the low quality of the British officers, who had a propensity for charging off willy-nilly in the midst of the fighting. I thought the two and three-page chapters made for a disjointed narrative at times. The book would also have benefited from color illustrations instead of B&W, as some of the reproductions of key moments in the battle, like the charge of the Scots Greys, are high-quality artwork."
3,Solid but not essential,"This is a pretty solid vintage Wolverine collection that pulls together two separate story lines, one By Marv Wolfman and another written and drawn by Erik Larson. Of the two the Wolfman story is much more enjoyable, although it is pretty simple and the small page count per issue (7-8 pages) keeps the plot pretty thin. The Larson story runs through the last 3 or maybe 4 issues collected here and are merely OK. The story is pretty forgettable, and more an excuse to hang the art on than anything else. These stories are pretty much outside of regular continuity and can be read with equal entertainment value by readers fairly new to Wolvie or those who have a more broad based familiarity with the character.Rating: 3/5 - Solid but not essential"
1,awful rehash thats a waste of time and money.,"terrible,cut to pieces and taped back together in an awful pathetic attempt to release it as 'explicit' and 'uncut'. wate of time and money."
1,Chopped up Debbie Does Dallas,This copy of Debbie Does Dallas is a chopped up copy of the original. When it comes to a XXX part it gose into a loop as soon as it comes to a hard core part. Very Boreing.
4,Basic Bench Grinder,"Nice enough slickly packaged Delta Tool. Does what it's supposed to do. There are a number of other accessory wheels available, finer grit, cloth, etc. Work Light is a nice accessory. I use this for rough stuff, I've got a Grizzly low speed wheel for sharpening. Like a lot of tools skimping on the tool to save money may not be the best idea. I frankly think that the 8"" unit for the extra power and high surface speed of the wheels would have been a bit smarter for my use. Variable speed is great if the speed is high enough to begin with. If you can get by with a light duty grinder this one is servicable, the package attractive the light a plus. I'd rather have an accessory than a groove in the rest however."
4,grinder,This grinder meets my requirements.It was easy and quick to set up.All the parts were there.It is good for the price.
4,Reasonably good product,I have no significant complaints about the product. It is what you would expect for a middle of the road home shop grinder. The flexible light needs to be a few inches longer in order to fully illuminate the tool rest platform. There are shadows because the light doesn't reach far enough.The fore and aft adjustments to the tool rest platform are poorly thought out and require a wrench. The supplied wrench doesn't reach the back bolts very well (there needs to be an offset bent into the wrench). You can't reach it either with a socket wrench because there is not enough clearance with the motor housing. I don't even see why they use hex bolts when it would be much better to have knobs.The grinder itself runs smoothly and the variable speed works well.My biggest complaint is that the Delta grinder stand that was sold with this grinder does not fit (bolt pattern doesn't line up) and I will have to fabricate an adapter plate.
2,Poor Quality Control,"I purchased this unit and found a couple problems with it. For one, they left a burr on the arbor that caused the left wheel to tilt noticably - not very good at 3500RPM! Also, both wheels were labeled identically, even though they were obviously different grits, and different colors. Needless to say, this unit went back, and my desire for Delta gear has lessened.I will say that the dual-speed option is very nice. I almost kept it to make it into a buffing station, but figured I could save several dollars by not buying wheels or guards.On another note, I purchased this to use with a Wolverine sharpening system. None of the current Delta units will work with the Wolverine since the mounting holes do not allow one to center the Wolverine base unit centered directly under the wheel."
4,Quite pleased so far.,"I bought this to replace a cheap one I'd bought locally. I thought the speed control was defective because it would actually speed up below the half-way point. I spoke with Delta support and found a repair center one town away. However, the next day I powered it up and it then (and has since) worked fine.I also purchase a Veritas jig for sharpening. Rather than get rid the other single speed grinder I decided to keep it for rough-work and wire brushing. I mounted both on a table with a dado routed in front of them, added an Incra ""T""-track and can now move the Veritas jig to any of the four wheels."
2,"Ok grinder, speed controller quit working","The grinder itself is a solid piece. No problems. Unfortunately, with only about 2 months of light use, the variable speed controller quit working. I have since had to move and it's likely no longer under warranty (been in storage.) I would not have paid what I did for a single speed grinder. Can't recommend based on the quality control issues."
2,Dale,"The thing is, Casio makes disposable watches. Keep that in mind! The watch looks great and I am sure it is great mechanically. The combination of atomic and solar is great. But, the housing is made of plastic. In less than a week, I've got a noticable scratch. Also remember, the watch ""crystal"" is made of plastic, so it's only a matter if time until that looks bad."
4,Nice!!,"This is a pretty good watch. Looks pretty cool, keeps time perfect, no hassle of changing bateries coz it runs on avaialble light, synchronizes time with NIST by radio, scratchproof glass (believe me, I've tested this), ain't too heavy on the pocket either.The only cons (and the reason for the less than perfect rating) is the large size (not that much of a putoff fer me, but depends on your tastes), and the iffy synchronization (it dint handle the switch from Daylight savings to normal time very well)If you can overlook the above 2 minor cons, this is an awesome watch for the price."
4,Good practical watch - but could be better,"This is a good practical watch - but could be better.To make it a better watch - make the size of the case smaller, the LCD backlight brighter."
4,Cute,"The charm was very cute and exactly what I was looking for. However, it was so small the picture wasn't really recognizable. This is not the manufacuture's fault. These types of charms are just naturally small and items with lots of details are typically hard to make out."
1,Major Rip-Off!,"I was all ready to enjoy these ""blasts from the past."" Then they arrived, and what a let down! Only one of these cuts is an original, and that's ""Relley, Ace of Spies"" -- probably not what you bought the disc for. The others are covers, and don't sound like the unmistakable originals. So, be fore-warned. If you are looking for ""interpretations,"" then go ahead. But if you are looking to purchase the real thing, you will need to go elsewhere."
2,"""Various"" Artists - Not The Originals","There are some wonderful choices for secret agent's themes included on this CD (the notable exception is The Rockford Files), unfortunately almost none of them some like the original. I still enjoyed several of them for their unique approach to the theme, but if you're looking for music that sounds like the originals - this isn't it."
3,Good looking but that's it,"The Gerber Paraframe I is a good looking knife. It's small, compact, and has a good feel in the hand - but that's about it. This knife is made in China. When was the last time you heard of a good Chinese knife... or a sword? I wasn't expecting a Zolingen or a Seki for this price, but knives are meant to cut through things - this one will not do that out-of-the-box. I think this is the first knife I had that I didn't cut myself on the first day of ownership. Afterall, Gerber is a Fiskers brand. They make better scissors than knives (and their scissors ARE awesome). It's still feels nice to have it on your belt, and the steel is very strong. If you purchase this, I recommend loosening the hex-screw on the axis for easier one-hand opening. All in all, it's a ""I want to look cool"" knife."
3,"Pretty Girls, Overproduced","I enjoy Playboy video in small doses which consistently has pretty girls, but ocassionally they are obsessed with breast implants, bleach blondes, and boring celebrity nudes. This DVD has the same cookie-cutter production scheme we've seen hundreds of times before--not original or daring, only the faces change. Camera never stops moving and panning, focus on room, interview models mother, all nude shots are very quick cuts and pans, which is mind-boggeling rediculous for a nude modeling DVD. Playboy seems to be in denial of why we buy their DVDs--too see beautiful nude models without all the BS and overproduction values. Many shots are of some extraneous object around the room. The constant panning and quick cuts are annoying. I have to run my DVD player in slow motiion just to get a reasonably good look at the model. A good DVD of beautiful Playmates, but you have to know what to expect and not to expect anything explicit."
3,OK...not bad...Keep Trying Playboy!,"Ok, not bad Playboy but you need to try harder! Everytime they make a video they blow it!! I must say ALL the women are really cute, beautiful or OUTSTANDING! Yes they get naked..ok, great..but then, oh no..here comes the junk, guys faces, candles, flowers, bed posts, wine glasses, and then THE LIGHTS GO OUT Technique! I suspect there is a crazy old scientist,(Hef?)who controls all their production and editing,(heh heh..ho ho..now lets take out the good parts and insert a fig leaf, a bed post and a photo of grandma)! Other reviewers in the past have said the same things, when will Playboy learn?! BUT aside from my negative review this video calendar is THE BEST calendar they ever made! Not their slipshod editing and production ""VALUES"" just the women...incredible women! Buy it, and play it S L O W!"
4,Really usefull!,"Though you can find the entire book online I wanted a physical copy for myself. I purchased this due to a research project (comparing Locke and Descartes theory of knowledge) which I am currently working on. This is a tremendous resource for anyone who is reading Locke's Essay - the language was straight forward, yet not convoluted - something which is rare for many phil books. Highly recommend it."
5,You will not regret buying this book.,"This book really touched me. It's the story of a single mother's struggles with her own anxieties and her complex relationship with her daughter. You can't help but love the characters in this book - they will stay in your thoughts for months after you finish it. I was impressed by Juska's ability to develop the main character, Charlotte, in such a realistic and truthful way. It's a very different book from Juska's first, which is also an excellent read. I think we can expect great things from this author, and I look forward to reading book 3."
4,Hazards of Sleeping Alone Review,I could not put this book down! It show's the how Charlotte a divorced 45 year old mother had to get over her divorce and her fear of life. As her free-spirited daughter Emily is spreading her wings and taking life to the fullest everyday! Charlotte learns that it is ok to be afraid but you also have to live. After finding out her daughter is pregnant and living in a alternate living arrangement and discovering her ex-husband is in a loveless marriage Charlotte now must grasp all of this within a short period of time. Also after a lifetime of being the quiet easy going mother she has now found her voice and learns that it is ok to have an opinion. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a funny and eye opening read.
3,Borrow this from the local library!,"I enjoyed the story, and it was definitely a charming and thoughtful tale. But I could not begin to understand Charlotte until nearly the end, and it was only then that the book got good. Because I could not undersand or relate to Charlotte, I was just impatient with her and her story. It is hard for me to understand anyone being that afraid to live, but I felt like I almost understood by the end. Overall, the novel is slow to start, but ends better, and is a very good portrayal of the complications of family relationships."
5,Sweet Dreams,"This is a really awesome cassette. My son enjoys listening to it at night. Very good words in the song very positive. Hits the nail on the head if you have a baby boy, all the feelings from before baby is born till he is growing up. A++[]"
5,close to home cooking,I found the recipes easy to follow.Very close to the way my mother cooks them. Even better when I was able to get the ingredients at a store in bellevue called LA Espanola (425-641-0249). They carry the yellow chile (aji) and red chile (aji) and other ingredients that gives Peruvian cooking its unique flavor.
5,They were right!,"I had read others' comments saying that this is the best eyebrow pencil on the market, and I agree! It is much more realistic looking than the Lancome one I had used for years. It is triangular in shape, but sharpening is not a problem at all when you also order the inexpensive sharpener that is made for it. I do wish that it had a stiff brush attachment on the other end, but I've been using an old Lancome pencil's brush tip since the Laura Mercier one doesn't have it."
5,I love it!,"This pencil does the track. It is easy to apply; not messy like brow gel. I have the blond shade. It doesn't look too harsh on me. I also spent a very small amount of money purchased the pencil sharpener for this pencil, it worth every cent and then some."
3,Steal a Pencil for Me,"The story was fascinating, but for me, I would have preferred to see more ""live action"" type video, not so many still photos. NEvertheless, the story was fascinating."
4,steal a pencil for me,"Steal a Pencil for MeThe move was so good that I had too get the book and read it too. I think it is a must see move. Just to let pepole know that the Holocaust did take place that 6,0000 Jewish people were killed in concentration camps in W.W.ll and this should and will not happien again."
3,great testament of the human spirit...,"This was a real interesting take on the Holocaust. It really shows the ""realness"" of the lives that it touched. Not everyone might agree with the background of the love story, but it is love none the less and shows basic human nature continued even through the dramatic and painful period of the Holocaust. Jaap and Ina's story is a great testament to the human spirit. The best part of the documentary was when he spoke to the school children as he and Ina walked the path in Westerbrook so many years later. So much can be learned and appreciated from his words. There are adult themes in this so I don't think it would be appropriate for younger audiences."
3,"Excellent film, but...","This documentary is a great idea and it's very well perfomed. The testimonies, the images, and the documents used to tell the story are interesting and beautifully used.However, there is a problem with the item itself. It doesn't have subtitles options but in the product's review this is not specified. Moreover, the DVD doesn't work in all DVD players. I have an average DVD player (Samsung) but when I try to play the DVD it says ""Play prohibited"" so I had to watch it in my computer."
5,Straight out of the story!,"Barbie as the Princess and the Pea wears a lovely outfit of light purple with golden, cream and light green shades. Ribbons stream from her puffed up sleeves. In her hand, she carries a cute little pillow with one plastic green pea sewn on it. Her long hair is a strawberry blonde and she has a slightly lost look in her eyes which make her all the more like she stepped out of the pages of a book telling the story of ""The Princess and the Pea"". I love her look and I'm glad I have this Barbie in my collection."
4,Great Barbie...,"We bought this Barbie as a gift for a 3 year old. It met all of our expectations. And, we wanted something that she could tie in to a book (as she loves bookstores and books)."
3,"Good track, same single as another version, just no video, so not so special","Again, what can I say, Nickelback's album ""The Long Road"" was a hit because of it's excellent collection of songs, and this one was among the many. This single features leader of men unplugged live, and feelin way to damn good radio and album versions. This actual cd didn't contain the video, but I got it for less than a buck new, so can't complain. Worth a listen, but if you must buy a single, get the one with the video. If you want just one song, just buy the album, it's cheaper in the long run, cause you'll like all the tracks."
4,Good adventure,"This is a very interesting tale of high society and very precious and rare gems, skillfully woven by a good writer. The details about making jewelry were fascinating, and there are plenty of interesting characters and plot twists to keep the reader intrigued. However, I didn't really sense that much attraction or commitment between Allegra and Todd, and it is this lack that left me feeling vaguely unsatisfied after finishing this book. That said, there is still a lot of exciting adventure in this book, and it is a very good afternoon's read."
4,Excellent Christmas time reading,"In our fast paces world it sometimes seems so hard to spend time thinking of the real meaning of Christmas. However, it is so easy to have those old familar carols going through our heads, hearts, and mouths at the Christmas season. This book helps you to know just a bit more about some of these cherished hymns so that as these hymns echo though your mind your thoughts are on a few of the unique blessings of this wonderful season that we have to adore and honor that babe in a manger that desires to change your whole heart and life."
2,Robert J. Morgan Can Do Better,"This book is not up to Robert J.Morgan's usual good standards...Reads like what it is, a book designed to sell and make money at Christmas...No real depth, touch or feeling evident for the hymns or their stories. A workmanlike effort with little inspiration in the telling of the stories....Best thing about this book is the CD that comes with it. A ""last minute stocking stuffer"" at best. If that."
4,Safari self cleaning slicker brush a must have,If you have multiple dogs or double coated breeds this is the brush for you. I love this brush. The smaller size is prefect for small to medium breeds and great for cats as well.
1,Unbelievable -- and that's not a compliment,"Reading these recycled articles you'll frequently find yourself thinking, ""Unbelievable -- incredible!"" And that should be a tip-off. Rabinowitz is a superb writer but she makes her living working for the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, which is quite consciously a propaganda machine with no respect for intellectual honesty or even simple consistency. Rabinowitz is the very person who wrote the article accusing the President of the United States of committing rape on the basis of evidence much, much weaker than the evidence mustered by the prosecution in any one of the cases described here. The difference, needless to say, is that Rabinowitz didn't like the President. Her prejudices, rather than any respect for the truth, is the driving force behind this book."
3,The Wish List,The Wish List is a good book and I really like the was writer wrote it and many kids should read it..
4,Sissy Kissy,"While the Wish List has the same quirky characters as the Artemis Fowl series, the story didn't hold my attention as well. I found myself having to put the book down or go back to reread sections. The story turns direction and picks up speed at the Kissy Sissy chapter but somewhat to the determent of plot. Just suddenly the main character knows how her powers work. Then later the story stops dead in its tracks for some lengthy flashback chapters where a paragraph or two would have sufficed."
5,It was great!!!!!,I love the Artemis Fowl Series.The Wish List is just as good because he really describes the characters so you feel like you know them when you're reading the story just like in Artemis Fowl. It is the opposite of Artemis Fowl though because Meg is not the same kind of criminal as Artemis. Lowrie is also sooo funny and the way Colfer describes heaven and hell is hilarious!!! Definitely read this book if you like the Artemis Fowl Series!!!!!
3,Da Bestest Book eva (sept the Halo series),"The Wish List by Eion Colfer is a good book to read if you ever get the chance. It is about a girl named Meg Finn and her life. Cast out of her home after her mother's death by her lazy, drunken, abusive stepfather, she is now nothing more than a troublemaker. After her last stunt finding a home is the last thing on her list of troubles. Meg and her partner in crime Belch try to rob an old man by the name of Lowrie McCall. In a tragic accident she gets sent to the sprit world only to be sent back to help the very man she tried to rob. Why? Because her good and evil deeds are dead even. If you want to find out what happens you will have to read this book."
5,The Wish List is GREAT!,"Wow! Just imagine a sticky situation. In the sad story, The Wish List, Meg Finn dies and her half good soul half bad soul is up for grabs! This book besides sad is funny. Like when Meg gives Lowrie a makeover. Now that was funny!!!!!!!!!!You can't stop reading this book. Eoin Colfer makes any writing entertaining. He begins the book by saying, 'Meg and Belch were doing a job. MEG AND BELCH. ' You want to find out what happens! Who? What job? TELL ME MORE! Beginning to end the story is entertaining.Some parts were heartbreaking. Franco is the person who causes the book to be heartbreaking. Some words that they say are inappropriate. They say these curse words to descibe Franco because he does bad things. For example he sells his dead wife's diamond ring. That is why the book is very heartbreaking.To see what happens in these 252 amazing pages, read the book I gave 5 stars, The Wish List, by Eoin Colfer!By Bryanna"
4,Lighthearted with Colfer's Usual Style,"This book had a lot of fun light moments, and while the subject of going to Heaven or Hell is a heavy subject, this is definitely a comedic treatment of the whole thing. I really liked the little touches of modernization of the afterlife which were sprinkled in.The audiobook narrator did a pretty good job of using a variety of different voices for the various characters although one or two of the voices were hard to understand. There are a lot of different viewpoints so the voices helped a lot.In general this is a feel good sort of book, and while it's not all that heavy on substance, it's still a fun read when you're not looking to think too much. If you enjoy Colfer's other YA books, this is very similar in tone and style."
5,No dissapointments.,"[...]. There is no mention of a religious focus, and you dont need one to enjoy this book. It is well written, imaginitive, and something not a lot of authors would be bold enough to write about, and therefore all the more unique. Heaven and hell are controversial subjects, but you could find controversy in anything if you are set on looking for it, even in some of the topics in the Artemis Fowl books. If you have the ability to look at novels with an open mind, then this book will leave you with no dissapointments."
4,"four stars, but hey, nothing's as good as Artemis Fowl","Seeings how I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Artemis Fowl"" books and read them all in a matter of days, I didn't expect something quite so good from their author. But once again, Eoin Colfer's latest is a fantastic and catchy tale about Heaven and Hell and what one girl has to do to reach the one that will bring her to her mother. On this journey she encounters an old man, a dog-man, a couch potato, and Hell's one and only dark lord. This book was a wonderful read, and I reccomend it to anyone who is a Eoin Colfer fan. (note: the character ""Belch Brennan"" was possibly named after author Herbie Brennan, the author of Faerie Wars which was a favorite book of Eoin Colfer's.)"
3,"For my daughter,not read yet","The seller said the book was in excellent condition. It was dogeared, beat up and not in good shape at all. I am not reviewing the book, but the seller of the book. He/she misrepresented the condition of the book."
5,The Wish List Book Review,"The Wish List is a great book! The author's name is Eoin Colfer. The Main character's names are Meg, ""Belch"", and Lowrie McCall. Meg and Belch are thieves - they rob Lowrie.The Wish List is extremely suspenseful and exciting, which is one reason I liked it. I couldn't put the book down! One part that was suspenseful was when Belch was about to kill Meg.This book is hilarious. That's just one other reason I liked the book so much. One part that was very funny was when Belch's mechanical ""brain"" got mad at him, and started yelling at him - in other languages!I would recommend this book to any boy or girl who likes a funny, exciting, and interesting read. Overall the book was awesome. I loved it!"
5,Spectcular!!!!!,"This book is awesome. It is about a young girl named Meg. Meg is a girl who makes a series of bad choices in her life. Then one day she was dared to break into a house. As they left the house, a young boy who broke in with her was mad at her for trying to call the police. She ends up dead because the boy that was with her shot the gas tank. She finds herself on an epic journey to make her aura blue. (blue is aura to heaven) Meg will find it isn't that bad being good. The Wish List is a book I will never forget."
5,The Wish List,This is an unusual book and shows again the fabulous imagination of Eion Colfer. It may be a childrens' book but it is gripping and entertaining - especially to someone in their second childhood!!
2,Wish List,"I found this book very boring. I found tha language used was effective but this did not overcome the fact that the jokes made where very lame. I found it very hard to get into this book.One of the very few things i like in this bok was the relationships, such as Beelzebub and Saint Peter or Frankie and Meg. Remember this is my own personal review and you can think what you like."
1,I agree with Chris,"This review is mainly for people who were fans of the first three books, based of course on Artemis Fowl. The Wish List truly let me down. Expecting more originality and inventive plot twists from this author, I read the first 50 pages (or so) and found myself getting through it slower...and slower...and slower. I simply don't want to read about religious things; there is SO MUCH out there that a kids' author can build on with a little imagination, especially consider our growing base of science and technology. I sincerely do not feel that frightening children with the uneducated myths of older generations is what a kids' author should be doing. This is not recommended for fans of the first three books, as the originality (even for all the somewhat cliche' fairies, etc. in the Fowl books) has taken a downward turn. We can only hope that he returns to what he does well in his next book"
3,Enjoyable quick read - Suitable for younger teens,"I read through this book in two days, and I didn't read exremely heavily either, since the font is so spaced out. It was an enjoyable read, but it did not rope me in like a great book does. Eoin is pleasantly funny with his quick humor and I did laugh a couple of times while reading his portrayal of Heaven and Hell and their residents. Aside from the humor I got from this book though, there really wasn't too much else I can praise. It is a good heartwarming story but there really is no suspenseful part of the book where I even believed there would be a real problem for the main character - I just kind of floated through the most involved struggles of the book like they weren't very threatening. I would recommend this book for younger teens maybe as old as 16, or to someone who is looking for a very light read."
4,amusing and undeniably pleasant,"I'm seventeen and I read this book at the urging of a friend...to my surprise, I found it to be highly enjoyable. I will not say that it was ""great"", exactly, but it was very pleasant, almost sweet in places, funny, ridiculous enough to make it light-hearted and yet still able to convey a deeper meaning. I particularly enjoyed the strange relationship between ""Bub"" and Peter...the whole thing reminded me quite a bit of Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, actually, although The Wish List was directed at a younger audience."
4,The Wish List,"Eoin Colfer strays from his Artemis Fowl series but with minute similarities in this novel, The Wish List. While keeping the concept of a real world setting but fictional ideas and characters Colfer tells the story of Meg Finn. Meg and Belch are in the process of robbing an old man when a gas explosion causes both of their deaths. Belch is sent straight to hell. However Meg is nether good enough for Heaven nor bad enough for hell and thus the story of her attempt to get into heaven begins. Although it is predictable at times and a fairly easy read, religious views put aside The Wish List is a good read."
1,bleh,One of the audio tracks I burned on one of these cds will not play. The sound quality was great however and other than that I have not experienced any other difficulties with that cd. Although I've only used this brand once I definitely would not use it again.
5,Great Optical Mouse,"This mouse exceeded my expectations! After a very short learning curve, I found this mouse was very easy to operate. It allows very precise movements of the mouse pointer and has a lot of versatility. I highly recommend this mouse!!!!"
1,Battery is worthless ( DOA) and not under warranty,My battery will not hold a charge. It last about 1 to 2 hours then I have to put it back on the charger. I called technical support. They said they could not help. When I asked for a manager they asked me to call customer care. So I called customer care. They said that batteries are not under warranty. I'm still looking for that fine print. Well I've never worked with a company that would not stand behind their product. So I decided to update as many forums as I can to warn people to stay away from Gyration products made by Thompson. Do you want to be the next sucker with a dead mouse?
5,Say it ain't so!,"I'm sorry you had an issue with your mouse battery. I believe it was a 'fluke'...a lemon..if you please. I've used 'Gyromice' for more than 10 years now...they will wear out after a while, or the dongle will quit but that's way way down the timeline. In fact, one of my Gyromice I've been using at work for more than 10 years!!!! It's the original old school shaped one! No battery issue there! lol!! Don't take this man's word that ALL Gyros are bad..they are NOT!! I had a lemon one once...chalked it up to chance..ordered another one and it works fine and has for 5 years now! Gyromice make you FREE!! It has kept me from the 'tennis elbow' injury that comes when your hand is on the (regular desk) mouse for 10 hours a day...Gyro saved me! Now I can mouse in the air, on the desk, UNDER the desk, UNDER my lapblanket (I live in the mountains, my house temp is 58 degrees in winter!!), even from the doorway and down the hall~ Gyro! You ROCK!"
4,This is an excellent introduction to cryptanalysis,"Sinkov presents the basics of simple cryptanalysis in clear, easy to understand language. His examples and sample exercises that accompany each chapter provide the reader with hands-on practice of the concepts introduced. Whether you are new to the study of cryptography and cryptanalysis or you are well familiar with the basics of the field, Sinkov's presentation will have something to interest you. A mathematical approach to cryptanalysis that is well thought out and easy to understand."
3,Fluffy but Great Idea,"I really like this item, however I wish that they would include how long it is. I was going to use it has a foot swap for my flute, but was disappointed that it wasn't long enough.The swaps of this materal do really absorb the mosture and keep it away from your pads. If anyone has had to replace them they know they are really expensive."
4,"Nature's Answer Red Clover Flowerig Tops, 1-Ounce",the item Nature's Answer Red Clover Flowerig Tops. Came in very fast however it was NOT the alcohol free I requested
1,Worst textbook I've ever used,The other reviews are spot on. For a second edition to have this many typos is unbelievable. It does a poor job explaining the material and even my professor apologized for assigning us this book.
1,Donkey Balls X 2,"What Alex said, I second: ""There are so many typos in this book is pathetic. The book includes all these wonderful ""real world"" problems you can't find the answer to, so you spend all your time looking through a crappy supplement trying to figure out what the answer is when there isn't one. Half of the problems do not have citations to statutes. Finally, the jokes are not even that funny."""
1,Good until it stopped working,"I bought this car charger and used it for one week. Then it stopped working. The fuse is still in tact. I borrowed a different car charger and his worked just fine.I wouldn't recommend this product, even at it's low price."
4,review,its a good product and have no complaints what so ever. it charges my phone great and have no problems with it. Its cheap and affordable and it does its job well.
1,Already Released on Complete Recordings [IMPORT],Aren't all of these songs (and more) on Complete Recordings [IMPORT] (ASIN: B000E0VL4U)?[DW]
3,Hmmm,I found it interesting that the author's note takes the same tone about Ms. Mortimer as Ms. Mortimer took with the world.
4,Interesting and fun to see what the world looked like back then.,"I quite enjoyed this little Victorian traveloge. I picked it up expecting it to be more humorous, and although I found the writer's style quite dour and pedantic, I became more interested in understanding her perspective than laughing at her views. I imagine that there were many folks in her day who felt exactly the same as she did about any country that was not England. The editor makes a pretty terrific comment in the preface to this edition, however, in that the stereotypes that this book espoused back in the days of Queen Victoria or not all that different from the unfortunate and xenophobic views that so many people in today's world ...there is definitely a lesson to be learned here."
4,"I would really have hated to have been related to this supercilious, hypercritical harpie...",This woman surely must have been mad to have written some of these things. I can only say that it has to be read to be believed. It's completely hilarious.
3,4 stars if you are a big fan of Hussey or Carroll,"The previous review here is for the Alpha Video production. I viewed the film in a Mill Creek 50 Comedy set, and would agree on print quality etc. The major problem with this film is the script. It is pleasant but, medically, about as believable as a Dr. Kildare feature from MGM, and it stretches credibility way past the breaking point that a doctor as intelligent as Hussey wouldn't see past the tricks Carroll and Ruggles use to keep her in this small town. As the previous reviewer points out, the sets, etc. are very good and the actors are skilled so it's well worth the 80 minutes of your time if you like this kind of film. Old car buffs should pay strong attention in the beginning; Ruth Hussey has a car that's a beaut!"
5,I'm safer now,"I thought I was pretty smart when it comes to looking after myself, but after I picked up this book, I discovered all sorts of little tid-bits of information that I can use to make me and my family and my possessions a whole lot safer. This book is filled with common sense, useful, and easily implemented things that anyone can do to increase their awareness and their personal security. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I suggest that family with a student away at college, or a daughter living on her own, buy it and send it to them immediately; they will be amazed at all the simple things they can do to be sure they are safe."
5,Important and interesting material.,I do a lot of travel writing so I bought this book primarily because it had a section on travel safety. But I ended up reading it all. It's written in simple conversational languageand the author used plenty of real-life stories and examples to get his points across. The little anecdotes about his experiences as a police officer were entertaining and enlightening. I highly recommend it. It could save your life.
5,Best affordable motherboard!!!,"This motherboard is by far the best I have come across in the mid-range category, I spent hours upon hours looking at different motherboards and most were so expensive but for only a few better things than this, I mean this motherboard is socket 478 (supports pentium 4/ celeron), 533/400 mhz processor up to 3.06 or more, Hyper-threading support, can hold 4 memory modules (up to 4gb) of up to PC3200 (400mhz) IT HAS 7 PCI slots, the most I have seen on any mainboard, AGP8X, 2 SATA (the fastest hard drive speeds), 3 IDE controllers (for storage devices), 1 floppy controller, 6 USB ports, 3 firewire ports, integrated LAN, integrated 5.1 audio (with digital output capability), and an easy to setup BIOS. This is the best motherboard for the money I absolutely reccomend it to anyone saving money, but still wanting to upgrade later on."
5,Excellent!!! Must Buy!!!,"I love this book! I purchased it in the 90's and all of the recipes are timeless. This is a great book for first time and seasoned cooks (no pun intended). Because of all the great recipes, my friends have purchased this book too. It's also a wonderful gift. If I could give this book 10 star's I would, it is a must have!!!!"
4,A Natural Step In The Groups Progression,"This album fits nicely between ""Bare Trees"" and ""Mystery To Me"". Something that needed to be done as the group moved toward pop/rock super-stardom."
3,"A real Let Down After ""Bare Trees"".","""Penguin"", #49 early '73. This was just a real let down after their classic ""Bare Trees"". ""Remember Me"" kicks off the album with some good guitar rock, Christine McVie's ""Dissatisfied"" is good too. Bob Welch's ""Revelation"" is good also, I think the loss of Danny Kirwin really here."
2,Should have been called TURKEY,"I love the Peter Green-Danny Kirwan era of Fleetwood Mac but I also think highly of Bob Welch but this album is in my opinion a mess. The band just doesn't have it together on this one. Danny Kirwan's absence is heard very loudly on this CD and painfully so at times. Christine Mcvie's material is once again over rated and I'm not even going to tell you what I think of Dave Walker. Dave Weston is at best competant. Bob Welch's songs are once again just good not great. After Kirwan and Before Buckingham, he was the most interesting of the members but his songs can be murky at times. This is an album made by a band that is searching for a direction."
4,1st Mac I Ever Heard,Going to the beach with my friend Chuck. Listened to this and Robin Trower's For Earth Below on 8 track. Been listening to both ever since.Wish it was remastered.
4,Remaster This.......Please,"This is my first ""Remaster....Please"" review.My ears have over 35 years experience with these cuts.Like so many albums that have not had their due, I wouldlove to own a copy of this.....remastered. As I listen tothis now, while typing, my first thought is to approach anoutfit like BGO Records in the UK. Maybe start an e-petitionand send it off to someone who cares at the originating label.Never give up! Breadmanwalking.....Next up James Gang ""Bang"""
5,bible khmer,"This is a very good translation from hebrew to khmer, because not like the american or canadian bible society, God`s name JEHOVAH has been kept in most of the places, while most biles in english and french these days has taken it out because according to them there is no need to leave it. I`m very happy to have seen it. It has been really been well translated from the hebrew tetragram of God`s real name."
1,Khmer Bible,I got this for my wife so it would be easier for her to follow along when we went to church. She is from Cambodia. We discovered it only has the 1st 4 books of the new testament. We are not pleased about this at all!
4,Great Watch!,"This is a great watch that requires no maintenance -- charges its own battery and sets its own time. Very light weight. The titanium band scratches pretty easily, though. And for some reason, after wearing it for a year, the pins have decided to start falling out of the band."
5,finally one that i like,"I am so pleased to have finally found a Creole cook book that was written by a professional chef for serious amateurs or other professional chefs. Chef Carey's recipes are new and refreshing while still keeping in touch with classic Creole dishes. This book gave me a greater understanding of cooking Creole cuisine by using classic techniques that he emphasizes in each recipe. While reading and looking through the book I felt like I was in the kitchens of the French quarter restaurants that he highlights in the book. This is because of one of the unique features of the book, lagniappes, which are tidbits of information for each recipe. These lagniappes are great because they gave me a greater understanding of the recipe itself. I think that these are so important because many people, including myself don't know all that much of Creole cuisine."
4,Cool looking spikes,"Haven't been able to use them yet. I'll tell you next summer how they are. Look great, though."
5,Refreshing.,"This got me going. I don't know what Dikkers set out to do with this book. It goes beyond just being funny. He accomplishes what the books he's parodying try to. After I finished it in one sitting, stopped laughing, caught my breath, I stood up and was like, ""Damn that was refrehing."" I lent it to my fellow worthless brother but I don't think he's read it yet."
1,Horrible...,"The Onion is funny, but it must be ghostwritten becuase Scott Dikkers is a bitter unfunny author. No good. How can he write such garbage..."
2,Lame. Witless. Published by a glitch in a system somewhere.,"I love the Onion, Jack Handey, and all sorts of this ""type"" of humor. However, the utter lack of creativity made this a waste. I can do what this book does all day. I can't think up all crazy stuff Dr. Handey and the Onion do, so I look to them for inspiration. Really, is this the best you could do?"
5,This book is worthless! Just kidding...,"Why would you buy a book that is supposed make you feel bad about yourself? Because it won't. I'm not sure why, but this book is brilliant. It will get you out of a depression... may be by putting you in another one, but it's worth it! Trust me on this."
4,Irreverent Humor,"I work in a bookstore and came across this book while shelving my humor section. It gave me a refreshing break from some of the books I deal with on a daily basis in my self improvement section. As another reviewer noted, it should make you feel worse if you feel bad, but it doesn't!! It helps you take yourself a little less seriously. Clearly you wouldn't give this book to a person who is clinically depressed. I'm giving it to my nephew for his college graduation. He has a healthy skepticism about the world and will enjoy this tongue-in-cheek look at life. One quote that struck a chord with me: ""Your kids are nothing special. They're just like everyone else's kids."" Made me laugh and I'll better handle the next person I come in contact with who goes on and on about their 4 year old reading Grapes Of Wrath .... I'll think of that line and smile. One caution: If you do not appreciate jibes taken at religion (ALL religions), don't read that section!"
1,'You Are Worthless' is worthless,"If you want humor, stick to theonion.com or `Our Dumb Century'. This tired parody will impress no one. (Reminds me of spinal tap's 1 word review for shark sandwich...)"
1,too dark for me,"As an avid Onion reader, I had high hopes for this book. I eagerly awaited its arrival and sat down to read the whole thing at once. Honestly, I was pretty disappointed.The parody of numerous self help books is clear, which seemed like a pretty funny idea when I ordered the book. However, the novelty of this parody wore off quickly, and the humor was much darker than I had anticipated. I'm not sure that any book advising suicide (even in jest) would ever appeal to me. For me, this book was more unsettling than funny.I would caution the buyer to think twice (I wish I would've). This book contains much darker humor than The Onion. Just because you like The Onion, doesn't mean that this book is a sure thing."
3,"Ooooh, Biting Witty Cleverness! Wowee. (Yawn...)","Well, well, well. The perfect book for cynics like me. Not because it's a great book (it's not), but because it gives us the opportunity to chuckle at these little turds of faux wisdom that describe so many people less perfect than the corporate ""us"". Consider any of the attempts at creating sack-smackingly hilarious nuggets - and there are literally hundreds of them that will make you laugh out loud - and compare them to the fillers that do nothing more than promote ugly thoughts and hateful self-loathing in even the most self-confident: ""You will spend the rest of your life alone,"" ""You are a loser,"" and ""People who have kids are idiots."" Please, anyone, some thread to stitch my sides back up. The book is only so-so, if for no other reason than these hateful barbs are scattered haphazardly throughout. (Yeah, I know... I must not ""get it,"" right?) What's next, guys? A book of funny names from the NYNEX phone book? Wacky amputee photos? Spare me."
2,"Great Introduction, forget the rest","The introduction to the book is one of the funniest things I've ever read--I bought the book on the basis of it. But, once past the introduction, the book is bitter and nasty and could even be dangerous--much too much ""Go kill yourself"" advice. Not funny."
1,A real damp-squib,"I'm really surprised to see rave reviews on this book...probably, one of the reasons I bought..& well,...read it!!Dont want others to fall into this trap..this is the kinda book u wud like to give to ur mother-in-law while seeing her off on a vacation to pakistan !"
5,the feel good book of the year,"Man, I feel so much better after having read the good Doctor's book. It spoke to me, and it will speak to you."
3,"Really funny, but NOT for everyone","I thought the book was very tongue in cheek funny but parts were cringe worthy. It's also a very short read for the money but a fair amount made me laugh out loud. I would not recommend this to someone who is truly clinically depressed but for many people out there who can laugh at the absurd, it's cute."
3,"Mildly amusing, but generally mean-spirited without being very funny.","This book is a parody of those ""Affirmations"" books (and not really self-help books). They're fairly thin books, largely devoid of content as a form, so this is pretty much the same as parody. It's not designed to be read at length.The first few pages are hilarious. After that, it gets repetitive and kind of reminds me of an evening with my parents. ReadThe Trouble With Being Bornif you want hilariously pessimistic epigrams. If you really want to listen to someone telling you you're worthless everyday, try looking for a job in this economy. Or talk to my father.OK book to leave on the back of your toilet, not for much else."
5,This Book saved my Life.,You are worthless is a diamond in the rough. Nothing could be more uplifting and spiritual than hearing what a huge piece of crap life is. I mean seriously. How many times to the Marie Osmonds of the world tell you roses smell good and babies are cute? Well if you didn't feed them chances are your kids would probably eat you. And that is why we have You are Worthless. To remind us of all the bad that makes life worth living.
5,A Worthless Treasure,"The book was amazing! Everyone has those days where nothing goes right and this book took all of the random thoughts from those days and actually published them. As on of the most blatently truthful things I've ever read, I would have to recommened this to anyone who has a laugh-it-off, make-fun-of-the-world type of personality."
1,Can barely smell anything,"I bought five different NOW essential oil scents at the same time to try in my oil warmer. Although I do not like all of the scents I purchased, they were all strong and I would recommend them to anyone who may like those particular scents. However, this one barely puts off any scent. It's not strong in the warmer or even sniffing the bottle itself. I definitely do not recommend this product."
3,oops- it's flamable!!!,Bought this to make home smell nice. Has a pleasant odor but do add any to those olive oil lanterns! I almost caught the house on fire! have used other oils before but this one seems to be extra flamable!!! Is nice addition to natural kitchen cleaner as I don't use any harsh chemicals.
5,Now foods orange oil,"This orange oil is amazing and has a strong orange smell, I use it with my massage oils and I use it to make the home smell sweet and welcoming."
3,Good but Lighter Scent than Expected,"I was very pleased with the price for this essential oil and the quantity size. However, it smells lighter than the Aura Cacia brand for the same oil. I have other Now oils and have been very pleased with their lavender. Not sure if this is a quality issue or the one I received was old."
5,Fantastic!,"I use this in the making of soaps, oils, bath products and perfumes as well as floor washes and candles. The smell is amazing and strong. I will purchase from this seller again. I'm very pleased with the product."
5,ORANGE OIL,THIS IS THE BEST SMELLING OIL I HAVE EVER PURCHASED AND IT TRULY LASTS A LONG TIME. I LOVE IT AND WOULD RECOMEND TO ANYONE WHO LIKES ORANGES
1,ORANGE OIL 4 OZ,"I ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT THIS SELLER ABOUT THE SHIPPING CHARGES. I PURCHASED 4 BOTTLES. I WAS CHARGED $5.00 SHIPPING FOR EACH BOTTLE. ALL 4 BOTTLES COULD HAVE SAFELY AND EASILY BEEN SHIPPED IN ONE PACKAGE. THEY SHIPPED IN 2 SEPARATE BOXES FOR $20.00. THE PRODUCT ONLY COST $2.98 EACH. AFTER 2 ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THE SELLER ABOUT THE SHIPPING I WENT AHEAD AND ORDERED BECAUSE I NEEDED IT. I WILL IN THE FUTURE FIND ANOTHER SELLER AND NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY. THEY HAVE TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND GOUGE THE CUSTOMER ON SHIPPING COSTS. THEY SHIPPED U.S. POSTAL WHICH HAS A ""IF IT FITS IT SHIPS POLICY"" FOR $4.95."
4,Essential oils are Great!,"I love essential oils...I Love them for Room air freshners..justTake a spray bottle...add water and as many drops of the oilas you like...I like to put about 12 to 15 drops in about8 oz of water..totally natural..safer than Commercial airfresheners..I Love the scents available. Also..""look up on the internetabout Essential oils""..""How to use them safely"".what each one isgood for..as far as health benefits etc.I use Lavender oila lot. Many oils should have carrier oils used with them.instead of using them by themselves which can be too strongI made the mistake once of mixing up some old Potpourri withcinnamon oil..UGH...It burned my hands..so I learned the hardway about oils..Just be careful..check how and best way touse them first. I like to use Coconut oil as a carrier oil.Lavender..just a couple drops on your pillow..mix a littlewith a unscented lotion..dab a little on you and also onyour feet at night...Helps you relax.. Hope you enjoyusing the oils."
5,Oranges-4-Ever,"Now I can make all my orange dreams come true for less than $10. I have been adding this to everything from lotion to cleaning supplies & haven't even made a dent in the bottle. And the smell is really wonderful. I was worried that because the price is so low I would be disappointed, but I'm very pleased. It has all the cheerful orange goodness I was hoping for.I like to add some to my aroma lamp in the morning to smell while drinking my orange juice.The only drawback to this product is that it would be better if it came with a dropper top. As it is, I keep an eye dropper nearby to dispense it."
3,Used in homemade natural products,"I would definitely give 5 stars; however, the topper for the bottle that allows you to use it for drops was stuck to the cap and does not go back on or snap in. Unless we use a dropper we would have to pour the contents and let me tell you, that doesn't work! I tried once to pour the oil but it ran down the side of the bottle causing waste.The oil itself is great; no complaints there and NOW Foods always has quality merchandise."
2,Bottle is useless,"This company has a serious design flaw with the dropper in the 4 oz bottles of oil they sell. The dropper gets lodged in the lid and is useless. No issue with the product, but you will have to purchase a separate bottle with a dropper to use the product. I purchased 2 bottles of their product on line and 2 in a local store and all 4 have the same issue."
5,Wow! Use this in your Rainbow vacuum (if you have one),"This smells GREAT and lasts quite a while. Orange, Lemon and Pine are my fav! I use this in my Rainbow & talk about clean smelling : DThey need to add a dropper for these though :("
2,nice toy that lasted only 1 season,"A fun toy, but slow, not very responsive and certainly not durable. We only played it for 2 or 3 times this past summer and it stopped working, when I get some time, I plan to take it apart and try to figure why it doesn't work anymore.Another thing I am not too happy about this product is that you have to remove the cover and take the battery out in order to charge the battery."
2,disappointed,"I had received a sample of this tape at the wound care clinic and really liked how it did not irritate my husband's skin. Unfortunately, what i received does not appear to be of the same quality and it does irritate his skin. So I am disappointed in this product."
5,Great quality and fast delivery by seller,"I was very please with the quality of this product. My father used this product almost 10 years ago for my grandmother who has since passed away, and asked me to research it where he can reorder it to help with his current knee problem. He believes this is the best dressing and was very happy when he got the product. It was also delivered very quickly."
4,OK Little Hub,"This little hub is ok for most home networking situations. The metal case is a nice feature and much more durable than most of the cheap plastic cases on the market today. If you just need something to file and print share on a peer-to-peer at home, this is a pretty good choice."
2,a difficult understanding book,As an english-project I read the novel in class. The novel is about a fifteen year old white boy who had moved with his family from South Africa to Britain. After a lot of problems and a suicide attempt he comes clear with his life. At the beginning we totally disliked the book as it was confusing because of its difficult structure. In the end the structure was clearer. I did not like the jumps between the times and places because you could not follow the content. I liked that Selwyn's feelings were shown that you could share his identity. He directly talked to the reader and explained everything to him. All in all I liked the book because it shows the difficulties a mover has to face. Also the way of narrating the novel was good except the first five chapters.
5,The Personal AND the Political,"Tibet-O-Rama is a very refreshing book whose author is not afraid to blur the genres of ethnography and personal memoir (after all, Klieger shows, aren't our interests and observations informed by who we are?!). The protagonist, Eric, has a passion for Tibet -- is it just another case of the Westerner's Orientalist gaze/desire, or is it devoted political activism...or both? There is much to be learned here about those who readily give and receive aid, about the dilemmas that face those born with everything and those born with nothing, and about the commonalities they share."
4,Sharp is what a knife is supposed to be!,"Not sure why people complain about a sharp knife. I have several SOG knives and they are all high quality and sharp, the way a good knife should be. High quality steel holds an edge better and a sharp knife is safer than a dull one because you can apply less pressure and there is less chance of slipping. My brother is a muscle car fan and he loved the one I gave him. It's pretty cool."
1,Sog muscle car knife,"CHEAP , POORLY MADE KNIFE --- MADE IN CHINA --- THE ONLY HALF WAY DECENT THING ABOUT THIS KNIFE IS THE THICK BLADE -- POCKET CLIP BENDS THE FIRST TIME YOU USE IT - SCREWS THAT HOLD IT TOGETHER ARE BENT -- SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND BUY A PRODUCT MADE IN A COUNTRY AND FROM A COMPANY THAT TAKES PRIDE IN THEIR QUALITY AND WORKMANSHIP."
5,Great book for under 1,Our infant son loves this book! He seems to really respond to Elmer and the bright colors he experiences in this nice little book.
2,Doesn't fit standard auto grease fitting,I'm not a mechanic but I do lube my truck and trailer myself. What I was looking for was a right angle adapter that would fit a standard grease fitting. This will only work on a smaller fitting with the tip that was included. I've never seen these smaller fittings used on anything.
5,Fantastic Video,"I was at the concert in person, and it was an awesome performance. I didn't see him in the Carlsbad Caverns but it was totally awesome on the video."
4,Music,Randy Travis has done it aain this is aewonderful Dvd and cd everone who love music weather it is country or not
4,Very enjoyable,Randy was humorous and as usual did a nice job of singing the Christmas songs. We enjoyed it and the scenes in the cave are very nice.
4,"A lucid, comprehensive instruction to structural mechanics.","Regarding the 2nd edition, it's an excellent introduction to all main themes of structural mechanics itself (no reference to numerical methods included). It well combines classical and modern approaches of the subjects in a compact form. Ideal for getting insight into the real principles of structural theory and analysis."
2,Much less than expected [...],"I received my gift basket today. I bought it to send to my father who is 84 years old and really enjoys his snacks. I forgot to have it shipped to him and I am so glad I did. I was absolutely mortified at how little was in this pathetic basket. I could have bought these items and made a much prettier basket for 1/4 th of the price I paid. I am very disappointed. Money is very tight this year and I am disabled. This was a very special purchase for me. I am not sending it on to him, I would be too embarrassed. He would never believe it cost [...] and I can not believe it either. I don't have time to return itbut I just had to let you know what a huge disappointment it was. Merry Christmas, Patty Crotwell"
1,Basket with stale food,"I had purchased this basket of goodies to give my bf for our 2nd year anniversary. The basket was beautifully presented, but the food items in it was OLD and Nasty. The crackers were stale and so was everything else. He said that the only thing good about it was the cheese...but what can you eat from that basket with that cheese??"
1,"As the recipient pointed out, this was a basket of cardboard.","I was mortified when the friend I sent this to told me that she felt I should ask for my money back. She said it was a basket of cardboard, the quantities of food are ridiculously small."
1,A big disappointment,"For the money I spent on this, it was rather pathetic. I for it for my mom's birthday. It was really rather ugly. The food was all generic except for the two Russell stover candy pieces.Rather embarrassing to receive this . The description was the complete opposite of what was in the package contents."
1,Fraud,"I just received this charger kit in the mail today and it states clearly in the advertisement title that it fits nikon d50, which unfortunately it did not. Note: On the package it clearly states that this item is for canon, panasonic or hitachi ONLY. If you own a nikon I do not recommend wasting your time purchasing this item. 1 star was given because 0 stars was not an option."
5,Great charger!,"I bought this charger set for my friend as a bithday gift. She says this charger set is excellent for her to charger her battery anywhere, such as at home, traveling or on the road. It allows her catch up all greatful sight."
2,Pompadour - Not Just A Hairstyle,"A great deal of interesting historical detail, but this book reads more like a laundry list of facts than a true narrative. The author lists everything that happened in the life of Madame de Pompadour but analyzes none of it. Some people might find this refreshing, since there is no bending of facts to fit the pet theory of the writer, but it can also leave the reader without any clear entry point into or way to engage with the book. Additionally, it would have been nice to have more of the primary sources quoted directly, particularly Madame de Pompadour's own writings.It should be noted that the book was translated from the original French, and often, translators are forced to sacrifice artistry for accuracy or vice versa. This might explain the dry tone of the book."
2,Meh,"I was surprised that the author is a historian, because the book struck me as a bit amateurish. The writing was contrived in places, and elliptical in others. I agree with the previous review's comment that there were too many names tossed in and it was hard to keep them straight. I also think the book presumes a more detailed understanding of French history than non-French people will have; notes would have been helpful in some places. I have enjoyed the books of Fraser and Foreman and will probably rely on them in future."
4,Very satisfied,After reading the reviews I was excited to receive this vacuum and was not disappointed. Suction is good for this type of vacuum and the battery holds a charge well allowing time to clean a large area. The wall holder is a slick design but (there had to be a but) it would have been better if they had designed in holders for the accessories. Also found the filter had to be cleaned a couple but it's so easy it's hardly worth mentioning. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
4,Pros and Cons!,"I bought this to replace my heavy dustbuster type vacuum with a cord. My vacuum doesn't do well (at all ) in corners, around walls etc. So, this is mainly what I use this for as well as my stairs and small messes.Pros:LightweightRechargeableEasy to set upEasy to useConvenientCons:Not much sucking power(but it can pick up a cheerio)No bag or container for accessoriesNot made from very durable materials(but it has held up very well)I hope this helps !"
2,reviews?,I am currently a student @ texas state technical college earning a degree in CNS. we use this book in class but is not quite the book it is chalked up to be. it is ironic the only 5 star reviews seem to be from the author herself. this book is helpful in some ways but not many.
5,extremely good textbook!!!!,"this was just the book i needed - am so glad the instructor chose this one and not some other. being not so great at the computer, i really needed a book that held-my-hand and walked me through step-by-step without skipping ahead or jumping around. the author did such a thorough job presenting the material! this book is definitely a keeper - now that i've completed the course i find that the book is a very handy reference and i turn to it time and time again. i wish all computer books were this good."
1,Horrible,"This book is aweful. I had to study from it in school and hated it. The only reason I passed was because I already had a firm understanding of DOS. As I read through every chapter, all I could do was shake my head at how garbled it was. I knew what she was trying to get at, but half my class didn't.Anyone new to DOS will not learn anything if they are stuck with this book. Try ""Running MS-DOS"" if it is still available when you read this."
4,very engaging,"my four year old daughter and I found this channel surfing on public television. She was totally enagaged. As she was born in China, I ordered it and it is a regular watch for after dinner. It is interesting (baby pandas bark, did you know that?) and as is typical with National Geographic, beautifully filmed."
2,Yuzna's yuletide initiation,"No relation to earlier films in the series (I haven't seen #3 yet) which is a good thing.The movie stars Maud Adams (007's MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN and OCTOPUSSY) and Clint Howard (Ron's brother).A female news reporter Kim (Neith Hunter) is investigating the mysterious case of a woman's death by spontaneous combustion, which are linked to a bizzare satanic cult led by occult bookstore owner Adams and her freaky son Howard, who are on a quest for immortality.The movie is still nothing special, although there is a standout scene where Hunter is lying on her back in the grass looking up at some trees and the trees form the image of a face smiling down at her, and another good scene where a topless Hunter vomits bugs then her face melts. Nice huh? Merry Xmas everyone."
1,"WARNING ,MAY CAUSE YOU TO FALL ASLEEP!","I thought nothing could be worse than part 2 or 3 but we have a new candiate here for Initiation(which should have been the title of the movie)is the worst in the series by far. First off it has nothing to with the series and doesn't have anything to do with christmas(don't be fooled by the x-mas tree on the cover,you won't see santa in this movie)and the isn't even remotely entertaining to say the least. Its about a cult the manipulates a TV reporter into joining their cult. The movie has stupid effects with bugs as other reviewers have said and the effects are downright awful. This is the halloween 3 of the series,it is a bad excuse for a side story that should have never have been a movie in the first place just like (Season Of The Witch)or (New Beginning) of Friday The 13th for that matter.In other words the movie doesn't belong. SKIP THIS AND SEE THE CLASSIC HORROR MOVIE(1984/SILENT NIGHT,DEADLY NIGHT)INSTEAD AND YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!"
2,ILHM Reviews Silent Night Deadly Night 4,"An investigative reporter is attempting to solve a recent suicide that seems to be linked to a mysterious feminist cult in SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT 4. This film couldn't have anything less to do with the rest of the series, and clearly had the name tacked on at the last minute for publicity. No Santa Claus. No Christmas killing spree. No Fun. Instead, it plays closer to THE WICKER MAN or THE LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM. Only badly. The confused plot even has the lead fantasize about giant bugs before transforming into one herself? And for no better reason than to show off more of Screaming Mad George's gruesome creature effects. Clint Howard takes over for Eric Freeman and Bill Moseley in a throwaway role as ""Ricky Caldwell,"" if you can even call him that. Another terrible sequel.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
2,silent night deadly night 4-initiation,the fourth installment in the silent night deadly night series is not worth your money this movie had nothing to do with the first three movies and had a thing for using bugs instead of blood save your money and skip this waste of time
1,Waste Of Money...Waste Of Film...Just Plain Bad!,"I didn't really enjoy any of the ""Silent Night Deadly Night"" movies, especially this one. It has NOTHING to do with the original movie, or Christmas.Was this some sort of joke? Did they make it just for a laugh? It sure looks like it. Oh, man...I'd buy a copy of this movie just to tape over it. Freaky satanic cult...confusing plot, not to mention BORING. Please, take this one off the shelf and pretend it was never made.I was VERY disapointed with this movie. I should have just stopped after part one."

Oh, man...I'd buy a copy of this movie just to tape over it. Freaky satanic cult...confusing plot, not to mention BORING. Please, take this one off the shelf and pretend it was never made.I was VERY disapointed with this movie. I should have just stopped after part one."
4,Beverly Wong -Yang Tai Chi,This video is one of the better videos on Tai Chi that I have seen. I own 4 others. The multi-angle cameras and direction inserts help in the demonstration and of the learning of the hands and feet for each movement. The only disadvantage of this video is that some of it is in Chinese and you have to wait and listen for the English translation before you really understand. Her obvious knowledge and background of Tai Chi adds a dimension that no other video offers. This video is truly an excellant supplement to regular Tai Chi lessons.
3,Not for everyone,"This is a referrence video, not a workout video or a beginners introduction video. Very difficult with out previous exposure, the english translation is lifeless and not well cued, you might as well turn off the sound. Use this for visually correcting form, making the motions a martial art instead of the arm waving many other videos have turned T'ai Chi into. For the price you should be sure this is what you need."
4,A gift,"I got this for a gift for my father in law. He seems to enjoy it, I feel it is a bit heavy on Ad's"
1,Boring,"Nothing here except Bolin's guitar. Cheesy lyrics, completely unnecessary pseudo psychedelic sounds,monotonous voice of very unoriginal singer. There is one agricultural song too (""I'll be Right Here"").The lyrics are about drought, I couldn't believe my ears.How they got to make three albums is unbelievable."
5,My son says it's AMAZING!,The fact that there is a disc and poster just made the book even more amazing! My son loves reading all the little facts around the pages and learning little bits of information that no one else has picked up on. Plus Einstein is his fave!
4,Great introduction to the great minds in science.,This book has just the right amount of information to supplement our science curriculum. It is also a great way to spark an interest in the many different scientists and their work listed in this book. My son loves science and together we have really enjoyed this book. My older daughter has also found it really helpful. It is great for children of all ages and adults will find it interesting too. I give it four stars instead of five because it is missing a few scientists that I would have liked to see but all the most famous and a few lesser known are here.
5,Best Book for Teens Touches the Heartstrings,"It's no wonder that this much anticipated short-story collection by noted author Kathi Appelt was recognized as a Best Book for Young Adults by the American Library Association or that it is so eagerly devoured by young teens looking for stories that connect with their real lives.The school dance in these tales holds all the perils and delights of those memorable moments, the ones that young people use to define themselves and will forever look back upon.This is a book that can be enjoyed on many levels. Real, romantic, gritty, and touching, KISSING TENNESSEE will leave thoughtful readers with much to ponder and all of us still swaying to the music."
5,Loved!,I chose this book to cover for a literature class of mine and I am so glad I purchased a copy of it. So interesting. I loved it!
5,short but sweet!,"Kissing Tennessee and other short stories form the Stardust Dance by Kathi Appelt is a short book of short stories. The book is about different teenagers and their different problems. One of my favorites was Rachel's Sister. In that story the author wrote about a girl named Mary Sarah. Mary Sarah shared the sad tail of her and her sister Rachel's abusive father and what they had to go through. Another great story is The Notes Between the Notes, where the author wrote of two teenagers who don't have anything in common except one thing; they both secretly have a huge crush on each other. Definitely the coolest one was In These Shoes, in that story you/the reader get to go to the dance with all the other fictional characters you/the reader just reader about! The reason I didn't rate Kissing Tennessee five stars is because it is too short, I think I could have been longer. If you like reading fun books that put you in different perspectives, then definitely read Kissing Tennessee!"
1,Typical junior high?,"In this series of vignettes built aroung a junior high school dance, we encounter: a girl being beaten and abandoned by her religious-fanatic father; a boy reminiscing about his first love, who was killed by a careless driver; a boy realizing that he is homosexual; and a girl being raped by her boyfriend.The only thing missing is a good teen suicide. Perhaps the author ran into a publication deadline before she could write that one. Yes, this is just good, wholesome reading for today's young teen readers!"
5,"Kissing Tennessee, a book all teenagers should read","Kathi Appelt touches on serious teen issues ranging from abuse, and rape, to discovering you're gay. In Dance With Me you really feel the anticipation as the character works up the nerve to ask Lucy White to dance. You really feel as if you are one of eighth graders at the Dogwood Junior High dance. This is easily one of my favorite books. You can read and reread the stories unlike the recycled teen trash that has become much to common. You can hunker down for a moving tale that will bring you to tears, or you can pick a light cheery story if your feeling down."
5,Portraits of Bittersweet teen lives,"Kathi Appelt has taken a bold step from her picture books into these realistic short stories sporting a cross-section of teens from Anywhere, USA. Tho she sets her stories in the south at a Jr. High school dance, the experiences her characters face are real and often universal situations that most people can relate to. Each character has a fresh and unique voice. Kathi isn't afraid to include the tougher issues that some teens experience, but also handles the everyday struggles of things like a first kiss with insight and heart. This is an exellent book for peaking interest in reading in our young people who find whole novels too forboding to attempt."
2,Mothers and Daughters-DVD,I have received the DVD I purchased. The problem is it doesn't have sub-titles.How could I have known this before buying it?
5,Another beloved book in our house,"So my toddler will pull this one off her shelf, run to me so I can sing it, and go to her daddy to do the motions. The funny thing is, we can do this hundreds of times in a day....and neither my husband nor I are irritated by it. I guess it's the smile on her face when she plays with us during this song, and her engagement with the large illustrations. Another winner!"
5,Cute book!,"My 16 month old twins LOVE this book!! It's definitly their favorite. They have the whole thing memorized and love to sing it even without the book! They also have ""ten little fingers"" and it's great too."
3,IT'S OK.,"OH MY GOD! It's only 3VERSES long! I thought about returning it, but my little toddler seems to enjoy it! There is one that they sing to them at Daycare and that is MORE than 3verses long and HE LOVES IT."
5,My Toddler's Favorite!,"I bought this book for my son when he was about 12 months old. It immediately became his favorite book...he loved for me to read/sing it to him before bedtime. He's now 20 months old and still has me singing it to him almost everyday. He loves to flip the pages with me and study the drawings of the babies. The art work is absolutely wonderful. He usually only goes for books with real life pictures, but this one is an exception. When I first picked up this book I thought, ""Doesn't this song only have 2 verses...it might get old real quick."" But I was pleasantly surprised to see there was much more to it...we love sharing the new verses to this old favorite with other kids...they love it too!"
1,Do not buy for iPad!,I just bought this for my daughter to have on our iPad. It downloaded in black and white! This is ridiculous. Don't waste your money.
3,sleeper,"As a reporter who has covered Dr Blix extensively, I found the bookdisaappointing... No real news revealed in the book...Most are no more than recollections of well documented news stories.....In instances where personal recollections could make a difference, such as secret meetings with WH National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Blix says little.As confirmed by the publsiher, the book was hastily written to capitalize on the US political election year....I would have preferred a more detailed book with more personal tones included even if that meant the book coming out several months later....While interesting the book was disappointing."
4,A very good account of the WMD debate,"In all of the distortion of facts, lying and obfuscation that occurred surrounding the Iraq war Hans Blix came out with a highly tarnished reputation. Yet, he was truly a great diplomats and statesmen.In Disarming Iraq, Blix gives account of his experiences leading up to the war. He does so in a manner that is unbiased and pluralistic. I suspect in times to come this book will be held as one of the authoritative accounts of the lead up to the war.Without going into the details of this book there is really little else that I can say. Blix's account is a truthful relation of his experiences that he dealt with in a critical and unprejudiced frame of mind. This book is well suited to anyone who is interested in the politics leading up to the war. However informative, it is a bit dry and not the most entertaining read so it would not be appropriate for people who are interested in partisan rhetoric."
4,finding buck mchenry by: erik cartmen,"The book finding buck mchenry was a great baseball book. In the book an older man named Mack Henry. At first he says that he was the great Buck Mchenry but after he lies about it to a television crew he confesses that he is not who he said he was. Mack Henry coach a three person three person team called the grandstand. the grandstand won almost every game that they played. i liked this book because everthing in the book had to do with baseball, and baseball is my favorite all around sport.erik cartmen"
5,A great book for both Kids and Adults alike!,"One day my mother saw a book about baseball, and me being a major fan, she bought it for me! I just shoved it in my closet. I was not in the mood! A year later my fourth grade teacher read us the book! WOW! I felt like smacking my self for not reading it! Plus, I could really relate to Jason Ross."
1,BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!,I got this as a gift - contains 3 packets of stale cookie crumbs from Indonesia; 1 box labelled Bon Bons containing some hard fruit flavor candies from Turkey. 2 decent Cookies from Canada & 2 packets of cocoa mix. N.B. you cannot see what's in those boxes in the photos. The basket I got was not the one pictured - much flimsier. The photo shows a small container of 3 or 4 wrapped candies (Not Included). This outfit has printed plenty of disclaminers to protect themselves. BUYER BEWARE!!!
1,Lame '80's Giallo Retread,"This was one of those blind buys after Netflix never bothered stocking the title. Little wonder there; this is a poorly plotted, ridiculously inept giallo with nothing to recommend it. The box art is labeled as BLIND DATE whereas the on-screen title is APPOINTMENT IN BLACK, FYI. I was hoping for something funny, trashy and sexy along the lines of ARABELLA THE BLACK ANGEL or Sergio Martino's CRAVING DESIRE. Instead I fast-forwarded through the boring sex scenes and had no interest in the stupid twist ending(s). Best experienced while vacuuming in another room."
5,Made a huge difference when towing.,Needed to stiffen my roadmaster's ride and prepare for occasional towing. Cars] if much firmer and more stable now and felt great when towing last week.
4,singing is my life,This book is called Mama I Want to Sing. The characters are African Americans and it&#65533;s not a big issue in the story. The book takes place in New York. This story was happening during the Second World War. She really wasn&#65533;t really wasn&#65533;t prejudice against. Doris&#65533; father is a preacher of the church where she used to sing. She sang with the adult choirs when she was eleven. Doris and her friends try to become famous but it isn&#65533;t as easy they thought. Does she become famous? I really liked the book because Doris loves to sing and she didn&#65533;t give up her dreams after she could become famous and she didn&#65533;t give up. I really think that this book is good it is a good book to read. Read the story to find out what happens at the end of the story.
4,A lovely mix of electronic beats and warm acoustics.,"Combining cool, crisp electronic beats with warm, gorgeous viola and other acoustic instruments, Talk Demonic's ""Beat Romantic"" finds a happy medium between music old and new. Make no mistake, though -- the viola's the star here, haunting and lovely, and when it takes a back seat to the otherwise fine electronic elements, the album suffers. Thankfully, such occasions are rare, and the resulting music is dreamy, contemplative, and perfect company in the small hours of the morning."
2,Barbie the Biker Babe,Barbie screams down the streets in a skin tight smoking leather number. While riding a big Harley Davidson down an alley.
1,Definetly not the best,"This Barbie is as good as a Sunday Brunch on the Marrisday Parade if you catch what I'm saying. It is as fun as a Mallard Duck eating weeds in a marsh pond, as educational as an empty yogurt container in a CD rack, but as durable as a horse saddle in a bar. Buy it if you are as adventurous as Mr. Pollywobbles in a snack stand give it a stab."
5,Love Kyra Sedgwick,"My favorite show. I wish it was still on TV, but nice to know that I can watch Deputy Sheriff Brenda Leigh anytime I want."
4,The Closer does the usual 'drive by' discussions of a variety of topics but is highly entertaining.,I like this series despite the differences in philosophical and moral values between the series and my own beliefs. Season 2 helps fill in gaps in the background not covered in Season 1.
1,"Glitch in one dvd in The Closer, second season","I found a glitch in one of the segments of this dvd. The showing stopped momentarily, moved jerkily forward for a time, but finally moved on until the end. I haven't played the dvd again so I don't know if it was just a momentary thing or not, but I looked at the dvd and it seemed to be scratched a bit. I don't remember who I ordered this dvd from. This is the first time I have found anything to complain about in all the ordering I have done through AMazon."
5,My birthday present to me,"Continues to be a stellar cast and storylines. Fleshing out characters, comedy touches are like the perfect dessert. Boy, do I ever like my birthday present. Bring out Season 3."
4,liked it!!!,"only had a couple of problems with buffering, and some shows not being avalible. other than that no major issues."
1,have not received order yet,I have not received my order yet. I cant review this when I dont have it in hand. Still waiting and hoping for my package.
1,Have not received this item.,"I'm very disapointed, I have not received this item, I have emailed the company twice, with no response. I will never use that(Susyqdesigns) company again."
5,Love this show!,"So smart and well written. Heck, a show you have to listen a pay attention to. Love that. And all the actors are so into their characters..."
5,GREAT Series,"Very Enjoyable series. Kyra is great. Reminds me of an American ""Prime Suspect"" with Helen Mirren."
5,The Closer Season 2,I love this show. The ability to watch without commercial interepution is wonderful. Kyra Sedgwick is great.
1,Missing Subtitles,"I ordered this without reading the specs carefully. As I am hard of hearing, I expected to be able to read English subtitles. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that English subtitles was not included.Why would a producer make a DVD for an English customer base without English subtitles."
5,Another Closer Season,"This is one of my favorite seasons. I have favorite episodes in each season that I watch. Love the cast and many of the murder plots. Like the personal lives of characters thrown in. Occassionaly, there's slips in dialogue which are poor."
5,Great show.,I now have all seasons but the last. I am happy to be able to find tv program dvds with such ease.
5,So glad to see so many people agree with me,"This is simply the best TV series out there. I cannot wait to see this show flourish although I don't think it can get any better. I simply adore Chief Brenda Lee Johnson and her team. Including Comm. Taylor, Chief Pope!"
1,Do not buy,I have used a lot of floor jacks before and this is not a good product. It could hardly jack up on end of my Ford Ranger than after 20 or so uses the seals went out and now it is useless!
4,Brian Wildsmith's illustrated story of Jesus,This was a perfect gift for a young friend who was making her First Holy Communion.Brian Wildsmith is a wonderful illustrator of children's stories.
2,faces,"ooh la la 5 starsnod 4 starslong player 2 stars - too much stewart, not enough lane & wood1st step (small faces/actually 1st faces album) 3 stars"
4,Let the Good Times Roll,"This is the Faces at their rawest. It's a album that was meant to be seen more than listened to. I had the privilege of seeing them live during this period. This was like watching a good ole bar band getting it on. They sang & drank Matus (wine) on stage & just appeared to have a great time which in turn made us feel great too. Yes it's a wee bit sloppy, but it's honest rock'n roll. Feel So Good just makes one want to get off one's arse and boogie."
4,Interesting hit and miss release,"Faces / Long Player: This album has their great interpretation of ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" in which Rod Stewart outshines McCartney's own version. The rest of the album is a mix of party tunes and miserable attempts. However, even with all its flaws, it works together as an album. I like it, so I give it four stars."
5,Where pop-up books and art history meet.,A beautifully designed pop-up book that's a MUST for any collector. Very educational and interactive.
1,Why?,"Lena Jacobson does not play Buxtehude - she uses his scores as a bases for an improvisation.The scores are used as if they were rhythmically blank - like the Preludes Non Mesures of the harpsichord French School. In one of the g minor preludes she adds an ending, when I think it is completely spurious: the final chords and pedal upward movement are final and anything added just spoils the music.I am not exaggerating one bit: the notes are there, the rhythm is not, and the rubato is so exaggerated as to transform a crotchet into a medieval brevis. All the rest comes afterwards, regardless of note values, as small note values.It is almost unbelievable.If you want to listen to Jacobson rather than Buxtehude, this is your chance."
4,Not A Fourth Book...More Like *DELETED* Scenes From Other *POPPINS* Books.,"I enjoyed MARY POPPINS IN THE PARK, but this book is more like an ""extras"" rather than a complete book.There are a collection of stories and magical happenings that surround Mary Poppins and the Banks kids, and of course they all take place in the park.The stories and illustrations are still charming and I really like that in the beginning of the book there's a two-page spread showing an illustrative map of Cherry Tree Lane, the park, and the various locations that were used in the stories including Number 17, Miss Lark's house and Admiral Boom's, and Neleus the statue. And there's a personal note from author P.L. Travers that explains this book.Another good book for bedtime stories."
5,A wonderful book....,I am so happy to add this book to my collection. I loved the Mary Poppins series as a young girl and hope my grandchildre will love them as well. Thank you Amazon for giving me the opportunity to find this great seller and thank them for their super service!
4,Cool Barbie,"Barbie is Barbie. It just depends on how it is packaged. My niece requested this particular one for her birthday. I was told that I would be the coolest Aunt if I was the one who gave it to her. So, who am I to say otherwise. A 5 year old things that this is the be-all and end-all of her 15 Barbie collection"
5,Discernment of Spirits,This book is great for anyone wanting to know how to discern from God's voice or the Evil One's voice in your everyday life. A must read for anyone who wants a deeper faith with God!
5,Best lotion for me,I have sensitive skin. Very dry. I tried quite a few number of products. This is the best among them for me.
4,It's a Hardy Boys For Gownups!,"I have read three of the ""McNally Series"" and enjoyed them tremendously. Take them for what they are - a good fun read. Don't expect to be enlightened (although your vocabulary might improve) shocked or deeply engrossed in a serious puzzel. Unashamedly, the plots are as thin as a Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mystery but with a healthy dose of Bertie Wooster style. That is half their fun.So do yourself a favour this summer. Find yourself a beautiful sun drenched beach (with lots of pretty girls in bikinies - Archy would approve) bring a few imported beers (or if your in the right mood - a fine bottle of chilled crisp white wine or maybe a thermos of exotic cocktails) sit back and enjoy. Oh also bring some food - after reading about the wonderful meals you will be hungry.I look forward to finding my next ""McNally"" in my far from home bookstore."
4,Great Find!,"For a fan in Sweden!Thrilled to find it. Can't think of anything more fun than a ""visit"" with Archy McNally!Thanx!BZ"
4,Very good for practical use,"This Cable is good for playing, It is good quality, and the sound comes out well... not really anything fancy... doesn't reduce the popping sound while changing guitars or anything. It's just your standard Cable and it does come with a handy holder for storage..."
4,Very Happy,"I am very pleased with this watch and recommend it to anyone. As attractive in person as in the picture. I like the uncommon brand and German origin...as opposed to yet another Swiss watch. Even though you need to wind it everyday - hint, about 15 to 20 turns is the max and will take you through the full day, I have actually found the movement rather charming. I was hesitant at first as I had gotten used to the automatic movement with an Omega that I have. The reality is, I end up dealing with setting the time / date about as often because if you don't wear your automatic one day, or over the weekend you are re-setting anyway. Last point, learning to set the date took a few extra moments of focus, but ultimately easy to do."
1,Very Disappointing,"Benjamin deserves much better than this! With so much material to work from, I can't see how the author managed to produce such a dull account of one of the twentieth century's most important thinkers. Benjamin travelled widely, worked outside of academia, experimented with drugs, etc., etc., and generally led anything but a dull life, and certainly not unexamined life. It is the kind of book one should perhaps produce a la Benjamin's own fantasy of a book composed entirely of quotations."
3,Unbias Benjamin,"I have yet to read this book, but based on the reviews that say it does not give insight into Benjamin, as an academic..., I am very interested in seeing an account that may or may not fall pray to the narrative."
3,"A bit dry, though an interesting topic...","This book is jam-packed with information about Rome and its architecture. However, it does not present information in the most readable format. This book was downright painful at times (especially the night before a test). However, after having read it, I do feel that I know a great deal more about the topic. Does provide a nice foundation for further study."
5,Love these cards - helping me with birds in my area.,"This is a nifty tool. I know there are others, but this one is great. Some birds ""talk back""."
5,Let's make her fly,"My daughter who is 3, just loves to play with her Flying Butterfly Barbie. She likes to play with her outside. We attach her to the clothes line and she just flies back and forth. Emily wants me to hold Barbie and help her to fly. The only thing that she doesn't like is that her wings come off too easy. I guess that happens so the wings wouldn't break off completely. She has learned that she has to make her fly; that the dolls does not fly by herself."
2,I hope they sell spare wings...,"These dolls are bautiful, the gorgeous face, perfect hair and make up, the dresses are lovely, and the wings are colorful; but the wings keep coming off, they come off when my daughters play with them , they come off when I wind the dolls up. After 15 minutes of trying to play with them, wings and all, my daughters gave up, and they were making Barbie fly without them, now, they could have done that with any doll. Besides, this is a wind up toy, and, in my oppinion, batteries would have been great."
1,Worst Barbie yet!!!,"My daughter had been asking for this barbie for at least a month. Bought on Friday, the wand was broke by Saturday. I believe that I was just as frustrated with it as her, the wings would not stay on, especially when her little 4yr old hands was trying to wind her up. Now lets talk about the string that helps Barbie fly. I don't know how many parents want there kids to play with fishing line, I know that I didn't. She had it tangled up around her feet quiet a few times, could be very dangerous because it easily knots and binds. Needless to say, wings are lost, wand and string are in the trash, and for the money that I paid elsewhere,sadly it turned out to be a 4$ Barbie. Very disappointed. This barbie was meant for collectors, not children."
4,Butterfly Barbie's Wings,"I bought this for my four year old granddaughter and it is a hassle to keep the wings on. I had to glue the wings into the little tabs to take away the frustration. Other than that, the toy is cool, ""flying"" back and forth."
4,Fun for one child or two,"My five year old loves this doll. It's a different kind of Barbie that just doesn't sit in a doll house. It's also a good toy for children to interact with each other. Two children can make the doll fly back and forth a long the string. Or, one child can attach it to a bed post, door knob, etc. to make it fly. The only downside is the string can get tangled easy with smaller children, and the wings tend to fall off easily. Otherwise, it's a better than average Barbie."
4,classic EWF,"EWF in it's prime. This CD and ""The need for love"" Cd are classic and a rare sound for EWF, before the addition of Philip Bailey, Larry Dunn, Ralph Johnso, etc. You would definitely have to be a true EWF follower or a funk collector in order to really appreciate this album."
4,"Earth, Wind and Wonders to Come","I remember hearing this in '71 and being transfixed by a group that sounded so completely original. A ""different"" Earth, Wind & Fire than we came to know, but no less interesting. A muscular horn section with strong jazz sensibilities. Strong harmonies, funky, tight. They cover a wide range of styles. A great shame that it was out of print so long. I wore out my copy of this about 6 months after it came out. ""Love is Life"" is a joy with simple and idealistic lyrics(appropriate to the mindset of the time), it's strong harmonies. The first three pieces are exceptional."
2,not what I ordered,"I purchased this plan with my Blackberry Storm. Like the Storm. Like the plan. HOWEVER, I had to immediately go to a Verizon store and get the plan stuff all changed. They automatically sign you up for different stuff hoping you won't catch it! The store rep told me they see this every time with an online order. I saved money online, but NOT HASSLE! Verizon has some issues. However they have a sweet phone and good signal everywhere I go!"
4,A Delightful Read!,"Ms. Arwen will captivate your imagination in Romancing the Stars. It was a delightful and thought provoking look into people's actions and why they behave the way they do. She used celebrities most of us are quite familiar with. While you may not agree with the assessment of each and every person selected or may not like a particular celebrity, you will be intrigued with Ms. Arwen's possible insight into their behavior. You will see yourself many times over in this book and will find yourself chuckling aloud at many of her comments.The story that impacted me most was the tribute to Peter Jennings. I thought that perfect!Congratulations, Ms. Arwen, on a job well done!!!"
1,Product did not work with WACOM tablet,"Product advertises that it will work with WAYCOM tablet but it does not. Contacted tech support and I recived no help. Don't know how well it works with other products, but does not work as advertised with WAYCOM"
4,Works well,"I got the Keyspan USB Serial adapter to connect my old serialPalmOne m100 Handheldto a newApple iMac G5 Desktop with 17"" M9843LL/A (1.8 GHz PowerPC G5, 512 MB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive). The device is straightforward, connects to everything easily, and works well. The software for OS X works well also -- zero problems -- although when you begin to install it, you are warned that the software will alter your Kernal and it may damage your operating system. You are then admonished to, ""Use caution"". That's it. No other instructions to help you ""use caution"".Disconcerting at best, though I must admit that, once I bit the bullet, held my breath, and hit the ""install"" button, this device and its software have worked flawlessly. Very fast transfer rate too. I would give it five stars based on its performance, but I'm giving it 4 stars instead as payback for scaring me to death with the install ""directions""."
2,Literature?,"I had to read this novel for a college course in American Literature...I have to say that I find the writer's style interesting, but her choice of subject matter distasteful. I thought the only interesting character was a minor one, ""Shadrack"". The novel would have been better if it had stuck with his turmoils instead of the glorification of immoral behaviors, disregard for life... exhibited by the rest of the characters. I'd be insulted by the content if I were of that culture.... There was nothing redeeming about the characters or the plot. It was indeed a bad exposure to the writings of Morrison and leaves me never wanting to read anything else by her. I'd not consider it material for an American Lit course, maybe a course on women writers, but definately NOT literature!"
3,The Last Word BookClub,"After reading ""Sula"" by Toni Morrison, I felt that the story was too confusing and complex. It was hard to complete a page or two without re-reading a chapter looking for clues about what was going on in the story. Sula & Nel relationship was strange, I question the ""sisterhood bond"" between them. I took National Suicide Day has a curse in the valley and on the people. Hard winters, feeding the family, accidents?, superstitions attitudes. I would not recommend this book, Sorry."
4,good price,"it was used and looked like an old library book, but i'm fine with that and you can't beat the price."
3,It was alright.,I liked the book because of the characters. There was something going on for each character in the book and it does tempt me to read some of Toni Morrison's other works. The only problem was that the writing style seemed a bit too much like Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea (WSS). I couldn't get too involved in the book becasue it kept reminding me of WSS. It just prompted me to reread Jean Rhys.
1,what was the point?,"I was extremely disappointed in SULA, I had to force myself to read the entire book. I found it to be very boring."
1,The audio version is not for the moderately hearing impaired,"I'm sure I would have loved this book. Unfortunately, the audio recording was not loud enough for me to distinguish the words being spoken. I have a ""moderate"" hearing impairment. I always listen to my books while I drive, as I travel a great deal on business. Even with my audio in full volume, it just didn't work out. Guess I'll have to resort the print version someday when I'm retired. The one-star rating I assigned is a single vote of confidence that the author probably produced a good work."
1,Terribly disappointed!!,"I have read a lot of books, but this has to be one of the worst that I have ever read! I found it to be terribly slow and very hard to get interested in, not to mention that there are several parts that are downright offensive. Don't waste your time, there is much better reading out there!"
1,Worst book I've read this year.,"I'm embarassed to say that I paid [money] for this book, and I actually finished it. However, the only reason I finished it was because I spent [money] on it. I couldn't wait for the book to end, and I saw absolutely no reason for this book to be written. Complete waste of time and money....."
3,Well... if you have nothing else to read,"I wouldn't recommend reading this book if you absolutely could avoid it. It's quite dull throughout most of it and isn't very entertaining. The message throughout the novel is obvious however and that is the part of the book that I did enjoy. This is not a book that I think men would enjoy at all -- if anything, it is a poor excuse for a feelgood strong woman novel.Toni Morrison writes well -- her descriptions are detailed and somewhat interesting, but I almost struggled to get through this book."
4,too graphic,"This novel traces the history of a black community since 1919 to about 1965. I will say there are two main characters, of course she adds more details to one than the other, very specific, too graphic, almost pornographic (unnecesarely) some parts are so crude that makes you fell sick, the message is confusing. I don't know if she wants you to feel some sympathy for the community or feel discusted."
4,Enriched by the experience,"It speaks of a culture I know little about, Toni Morrison lets me in and makes me think about it."
3,Culturally Enlightening,"This novel portrays the segregation of the black and white communities during the Civil Rights Movement. It's eyeopening to see the different lives of characters, though fictional in this novel, and how the dynamics change between an old world black woman, Nel, and a new world black woman, Sula. Though I wouldn't put this book at the top of my list, being that I could never really get to appreciate the characters enough, it's still worth reading if you're interested in this time period and what kind of characters you'd find if you were to go back in time. On the other hand, Morrison's descriptions can be very vivid at times and her words are enjoyable to read."
5,A book for every woman in America today.,"This is a book that will make you think about what being a woman IS. When overwhelmed we tend to see only our own ""lot in life"" and forget there are others that have overcome so much more with so much less. Read this and realize not only how lucky you are but how strong you can be."
1,Sula....a disappointment,"About the only positive statement I can give is that Sula is a short, quick read. This novel lacks depth, plot, and is a mishmash of characters and ideas. I found the book disheartening as I have greatly appreciated other books by this Nobel Prize winning author."
2,unimpressive,"I had to read this novel for class, didn't enjoy it. There are some good lessons to be gleaned from the trials of the characters, though, not worth my time for how uninteresting the story,to me at least, was. Couldn't wait to get done with it so I never had to think about it again."
2,Point of book is lost on me,"I tried hard to understand and like this book. But if I did not understand it, then I cannot recommend it. One major positive aspect was the beautiful imagery depicted by Toni Morrison - very descriptive style of writing. But when it came to writing about the characters, specifically Sula, I did not understand what Morrison was trying to say. Sula was a very mysterious enigmatic woman who lived her life like no one else and dared to do things she wanted to do. She did not put herself through the experience of childbirth or stay at home tending to others like her childhood friend and all other women mentioned in ""Sula"". I didn't know what to think after the ending. What was the point?"
5,Everything I was hoping for and more!!!,"This novel is without a doubt one of if not the most beautiful thing I have ever read. I am a huge Toni Morrison fan and have loved everything of hers I have ever read, so I was bound to love it. But I really feel that you would have to be void of any emotion not to feel like a better person after reading this masterpiece! A truly wonderful book that everyone should read at least once!"
4,sula scottcampos,"Sula, a book that talks about the issues of being a black women is a really good novel to read.One of the reasons I recommend it is because of its realism and its themes - death, sex, friendship and poverty.I also think that its characters are very good, its easy to identify with one or both of them. I really recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature."
4,my personal fave,"This was my first Toni Morrison book, and has remained my favorite. You have not experienced fiction until you have read this book, or any of her books, for that matter. I'll just say she writes purely and poeticly, I couldn't give the story away."
4,Fine work from a Nobel laureate,"This novel tells the story of two life-long friends. Sula comes from a line of independent women and grows up to have contempt for the small-town morality of the Bottom, where she grew up, as well as an abiding hostility toward her mother and grandmother. Nell embraces the life of the community and tries to pursue a conventional life as wife and mother. In their future awaits an act of betrayal that will force them to reevaluate each other and their own lives. Toni Morrison's beautiful prose brings to life the community of the Bottom."
2,Sorry Toni...just not a fan...,"I know it is almost blasphemous to put down Toni Morrison's writing in this day and age. I just did not like this book. I found all the character's despicable and for that reason could never connect with any of them. This is a short book but I had to really push myself to finish the book. This was my first try at Toni Morrison and probably will be my last. I see where her prose is a big hit but if the plot and characters are no good then no amount of prose can save a book.Sorry, no Toni Morrison fan here."
4,Beautiful Book by Master Craftswoman,"Sula is a great character study. Boiled down to its simplest form, it is a story about love and relationships, as most stories are, but Morrison's prose and characterization make it impossible for you to boil it down, especially because you're too busy soaking up its poetry and trying to decide how much you can reasonably dislike each character while still being intensely interested in their lives. The complexity and depth Morrison packs into a single sentence is truly inspiring.That said, I thought part two could have done with a lot less summary and more scene. I understand the need for the narrative to move quickly, and the language was still beautiful, but it felt like a lot of over-explaining of character motivations for the benefit of the reader as opposed to the benefit of the story.Beautiful book, over all."
2,Hmmmmmm.....,"I chose this book because it was on the reading list for a very well known University and is part of Oprah's Book Club. However, I honestly didn't care for it! None of the characters were developed to the point of being able to relate or connect to any of them. The literature was contradictory in that Ms. Morrison writes beautfully but at the same time includes language and depictions that are very unbecoming and unnecessary. I almost felt like she was writing for shock value. I can definitely understand why this book would be good for discussion in an English class - it evokes a wide range of emotion. But the story itself was slow and ultimately, I just couldn't relate."
1,What a disappointing book,"When I first began to read this book, I was expecting some empowering and life changing novel. Instead, what I got was 174 pages of complaints about how tough life is. The novel had portions that were actually disgusting to me. It was extremely poorly written and if it wasn't for Oprah no one would even bother with it."
3,An Ignorant depiction of African Americans,"The book was a charm in the beginning until she began to skip around and I forgot what I was reading about. Although what Toni describes in the life of African Americans at the time was a personal opinion, she really made African Americans seem really stupid. Dont get me wrong some of us were piss poor at the time of the Civil War, but we were really not as dumb as she depicts. She has won her prize due to her outstanding creativity with bouncing around in her stories. After reading about Nel getting married, I did not feel compelled to pick the book up and continue. I really would not recommend this book unless you are taking a class, like me. But then again if you like ignorant drama, and outlandish metaphors Sula is definetly the one. I have not read any of her other stories but this story would not stop me from reading them."
3,Is Toni Morrison gunning for the black community?,"The book Sula is all too liberal in its character portrayals and the context in which it describes The Bottom, an underpriveleged African-American area, which the blacks of Medallion, Ohio were swindled into accepting from white landowners. Throughout the book, Morrison portrays The Bottom's characters as immoral lowlifes who have every tendency to committ heinous criminal acts in everyday situations. For example, a mother's pouring of kerosene on her baby and burning him to death. Also, the rampant sexual activity of women of all ages demoralizes black women as prostitutes. The entire style and prose of the work is something suitable for the new regime of social communism being paraded in our public schools, as if the author and leading teacher's unions conspired to create such a biased and controversial text for no reason other than to extend racial hatred and prolong social misgivings."
3,Sula,"Sula by Toni Morrson is a scandalous story about Sula and her friend Nel and their experiences growing up in a racist time in a colored town in Ohio called the Bottom. Sula's father dies when she is very young which forces her mother to move back in with Sula's grandmother in order to raise her. Sula's mother, Hannah, never remarries but throughout the novel makes love to many local men. Sula's grandma, Eva, is the matron of her household. Eva witnesses the death of two of her children by means of fire. After Hannah's death, Sula models her mother's behavior and ends up sleeping with many men. She eventually dies from illness, being outlived by Eva and her best friend Nel.Sula scandalous,Maker of love with many men,Lover of Ajax.Down to the Bottom,Racially separated,Sula and Nel walked."
1,Horrendous,It is amazing that a novel so poorly written could be published. This book is not worthy of anyone's time or attention.
3,A Disappointing Read,"After reading The Bluest Eye I expected better from Toni Morrison. This book was o.k but not what the back cover promised. I usually read the back cover and expect the book to follow it at least loosely. This book promised that Sula and Nel would reconcile, they never did. Sula died the day that her friend visited and they got into an argument then, there was no reconciliation. That and the fact that after being caught with Sula Jude leaves Nel and never returns. This doesn't sound like any man I've ever known. This was an unrealistic portrayal of a man. And what made Sula sick, the reader is never told why Sula was sick or what she was sick from. It is also never explained why the girls decided to kill Chicken what had he done to them? Overall I like the book there were just some points I didn't understand."
3,Very Funny,"Toni Morrison proves herself to be the D.H. Lawrence of the black voice--that is, minus the elegance. The most interesting attribute of this work is its dialogues. The characters talk very funny and, like, real."
5,A Beautiful Work Despite Confusions,"Morrison weaves these characters masterfully in her tale of two black women--Nel and Sula. Throughout the novel the reader is given characters who each hold different ideas about how a person/woman should act. While Sula (the character) presents herself in a way most might find inappropriate, Morrison never gives a difinitive answer as to where her sympathies lie. While I am contented to side with Sula, I can never forget the values of the other characters and how they contrast with Sula's. But, all in all, this confusion of morals, sympathy, and love is the beauty of the book. And without any of this commentary, the end presents a story one simply CANNOT miss--absolutely beautiful!"
5,A first-class page turner,"Nell and Sula grow up very differently in a typical black settlement in the 20s. Life choices move them apart, and when they meet again years later, it appears as though they are nothing like the best friends they once were. It takes tragedy for them to realize that they are more alike then they think, and that their bond is far stronger than any other in their life. Morrison has the uncanny ability to transport readers across time and place, and she has an amazing grasp of black history. Her words are like the weaving of a wonderful spell, the reader becomes magically engaged in the story, unable to put the book down until the last page is turned."
4,Great Book for a Quiet Weekend,I had a great time reading this book. Saturday morning with a cup of tea I sat down with this book and didn't get up until I had finished it. It's easy reading and a good story. You can really see and feel the characters.
4,Best novel to get introduced to Toni Morrison through!,"I have read the Song of Solomon, Beloved, and The Bluest Eyes and without a doubt Sula was the best one of all of them. It's an easier read compared with the others and therefore great introduction to Toni Morrison's writing. Sula is inbedden in the context of the Black experience in America. The Botton, a segregated community of mythical Medallion, Ohio, can be seen as any Black community in any town during the time period of 1919 to 1965. In addition, Sula can also be seen as a symbol of a strong African American woman, who chooses to live the way she wants to and not what others tell her to do. Definetly a must read if one wishes to master Morrison's writing!"
4,A Wonderful Book,"There are a lot of things about this book that I enjoyed. For example, I like how the author designs Sula in such a way that the reader characterizes her themselves. In addition, Morrison did a great job on exploring the theme of friendship between two women. Finally, the novel ahows the effects of racism upon black American life and I feel this is important in understanding our whole American culture. I would defintiely recommend this book to anyone."
1,Disappointing Book,"Sorry to say that although this author is one of my favorites, I couldn't get into this book. Boring, boring, boring."
2,The book makes no sense.,This book from beginning was unclear. Toni seems as if she had nothing better to do when she wrote this book. Her writing was unclear. What was the meaning to have Sula turn out just like her mother. The whole book was just stupid.I didn't like it and would not reccomed it to anyone. Its a boring book.
2,"Just Misery...Know Sula, No Peace...","SULA, I don't know why folks have been saying this book was hard to read, I read it in 2 days, while watching basketball play-offs! It was not difficult at all. This is the 2nd book by Morrison I've read, the other was THE BLUEST EYE. I don't like Morrison and she is not so great a writer to me. I don't understand how people reviewing this book could say it was a ""masterpiece"" or ""so meaningful to me""! It was about a dysfunctional family, hell a dysfunctional town. I don't get how this could be ""the best I've read"". Hell, it was depressing and Sula Peace had no peace at all. I really felt sorry for Nel because she befriended such a s.o.b. as Sula. I'd hate to have her as my only friend. Generation after generation was off from Eva, to Hannah, to Sula! Pick up a book that has some happiness about it instead of this.Just my 2 cents!"
3,My Review of Sula by Toni Morrison,"I received an assignment to read Sula, by Toni Morrison for my English class. I would definitely recommend it to others because it is a very educational book to read. It is also interesting because it tells a story of more than just one person. You get to look into the lives of Sula, Nel, Eva, Hannah, and Shadrack who all lived in the bottom. I enjoyed how it showed the friendship between the two girls who became such good friends, and then they went their separate ways. The novel to me was very dramatic, and emotional. Especially when Sula stood on the porch, and watched her mother burn to death. It was very detailed in describing the way things were happening. If you have a chance to read it, I would suggest it for being a very good book."
1,Don't bother reading Toni Morrison's Sula.,"I had heard wonderful things about Toni Morrison's writing, so when I needed to choose a book for my English class I decided on Sula. I was extremly dissapointed. The plot lacked taste. How could a reader sympathize with Sula? She had watched her mother burn to death with a sickening interest and slept with every man imaginable including her best friend's husband. The character Eva wasn't much better, she torched her son, Plum. The whole book left me unsatisfied. Also, her style of writing was too wordy! She'll go on and on without ever reaching a point. I do NOT recommend this book!"
1,why do these reviews need titles?,"This is a dreadful, nasty, unpleasant book about dreadful, nasty, unpleasant people. I couldn't finish it. I know Morrison can write, because her criticism is fine, but this...avoid it at all costs."
3,Thoughts on Sula,"Being only around 180 pages it is worth a read, although I would have attained more reading enjoyment from $25 worth of comic books."
2,Uneven,"I won't repeat what others have said about Morrison's lyrical and literary prose style (good) or her lack of character development in the novel (not so good). Rather I would caution potential readers not to attempt the audio version of this book. Morrison herself is the reader, and her breathy, whispery style does not translate well to listening in the car. Her voice drops off at the end of most sentences making it almost impossible to hear all her words. Very frustrating, to say the least."
5,Absolutely LOVED this book!,"I read this book in a day or two, from the first moment I could not put it down. Fantastically written! I only had a slight issue with the ending, but it was OK. Great book!"
5,amazing,this is an amazing piece of literature and i'd recommend it to any reader with an open mind. the book came earlier than expected and in great shape.
4,Sula by Toni Morrison,"Despite its similarities to Morrison's other novels, Sula is a powerful novel that deals with the themes of good versus evil, family, friendship and racism in a poor community. In Sula, Morrison is able to portray good and evil in a not so ""black and white"" way. Her complicated friendships and relationships leave the readers questioning who was right and who was wrong. Morrison's ability to develop such vivid and lively characters allows her to develop clear and powerful themes throughout the novel"
4,Sula review,"Sula by Toni Morrison is a novel about two little girls and their friendship as they grow up. Sula Peace comes from a home where men are used for sex and then tossed out, and her friend Nel Wright comes from a good home with a caring mother and father. The girls become best friends through captivating adventures as they deal with bullies and their impoverished lives in Bottom, the small black town in Ohio. Sula is a rebel while her friend Nel conforms to the societal norm, creating foiling characters that keep the story interesting and make it difficult to put the book down. Morrison's free usage of sexual behavior also seizes the reader's attention and the harsh but reality based situations that arise in the novel are scintillating.HaikusSula and friend NelFriends but different peopleLive separate livesStrong black evil girlSleeps around with lots of menShe can never loveStealing Nel's husbandSula betrays her friend's trustSula's death ends all"
4,Excellent book about British fighters history,"The Putnam is an excellent series of aviation books. Every books in this series provides detail information of aircrafts, systems, development, performance and history. This book covers the history of British fighters from 1912 to now, almost every fights you can find in other books. Although there are books for individual Britich aircraft company in this series, this is the book to give comprehensive coverage of all British fighters since World War One to current fron line fighters."
4,The poetic companion to Evyind Earle's mystical art,"This unassuming hardback book holds some of the most beautiful short poems and verse I have read. After all the splendor of his art works, I have to admit, when I bought this plain looking book sight-unseen, I was not expecting too much (I had to have something for Evyind Earle to sign however!!). But as I read through the pages taking in the beautifully rhythmic quality of his rhymes I came to realize how much his poetry was a reflection of his paintings and vice~versa... simple yet vast, concise yet unrestrained, melancholy yet uplifting... An excellent gift on it's own or as a companion to his artwork, this book is sure to open your heart."

1,Book is in SPANISH!,"Why didn't the Amazon book description (in English) mention that the books is in Spanish? If you hombres read Spanish, I'm sure it is a very definitive book."
5,it is one of the best motherboards,"it is a great motherboard but you have to be a little computer literate and you will be great!!! the overclooking and hardware monitoring software ""uGuru"" is very useful just take sometime and you will get the hang of it... you can update the BIOS with one click (don't need to upgrade the BIOS if you don't have a good reason to do so) it is a dream (mine) board and a great motherboard... if you are a crazy geek who wants to know what's behind everthing and google's everything that is new to you.... then this is the board for you trust me you will be not only a Gamer but a very DAMMN good A+ technician to. the board has everything you want and don't want is has only one PCI expansion slot but it is SLI ready and when in SLI mode you get a boost of 32X (hence the name) instead of 8X or if your lucky 16X with other boards. it has a great cooling system and two fans which pulls out the heat to the back... it is a strickly gaming board.......... so get it!!!!!!!!!!1"
1,The Motherboard don't work.,"Not Boot and stop in code 25, change the PSU, graphics card, memory and the problem follow."
4,Nice Watch,This is a very nice watch you dont have to ever buy batteries again the pic is a little off you dont get the one with the roman numerals but it is still worth getting. An awesome find
5,WVA510DA-1AV,It is the best watch I have ever bought. There seems to be a concern regarding the ability to receive a calibrating signal. Not so in my case. If I can not receive the signal indoors I just set it outdoors but so far has not been necessary. I recommend this watch to anyone. It is excellent.
3,i dont get it,"Is this watch really worth the trouble?Would someone please explain why putting the watch on a windowsill for several minutes every night, or overnight, to set it to the atomic clock is less trouble than just setting it manually every now and then?You can get a Seiko perpetual calendar watch that is accurate to within 20 seconds a year without the bother of hunting for radio time signals for a little more money.And what's so difficult about changing a battery every two or three years? Some watches have batteries that last for 10 years. And, as most people know by now, rechargeable batteries do not last for 10 years. They die."
1,false advertising,A three ball one eh? NO. Didn not get the 3 balled one. Got a regular hitch. Not worth the effort in sending back and getting another. Went to local store and spent MORE money but got what I needed. Time was a issue by that point. Somebody somewhere either didnt read the order or just didn't care when they packed and sent this.
2,Should have been a non-fiction,"First off, this book could have used a good proofreading before going into print. It is rife with grammar, usage, and punctuation errors.But more importantly, the style of writing is as close as fiction can get to non-fiction. Just take a non-fiction and put ""Christina thought that..."" in front of each sentence, and you have this book.The information the book imparts is good stuff, and I may have bought a non-fiction book on this topic, but the authors just didn't do a good job making a story out of their knowledge on the subject. They try to cram too many facts into the shape of a story line."
1,a bunch of new age crap,"This was quite possibly one of the worst books I've ever read. I was expecting an exciting story centered about the current debates over New Testament history. What I found was an unoriginal poorly written plot, that only digs into New Testament history, as it is currently seen by scholars, enough to advance the authors own beliefs in some new age omnigod. If you are seriously interested in real history there are far better books available."
4,The Queen's Best,"On Tour is Queen Ida's best work, primarily because this album contains ""Frisco Zyedco"" and ""Grand Basile"" on the same album. I don't regularly listen to Zydeco music, but I've never gotten tired of these two songs, and I can stand to listen to the rest of the album too."
4,Monsterific!,"My daughter, aged almost 3, loves the Monster Show. She's not scared of them yet, and delights in all of the crazy, colorful monsters. Harper demonstrates, yet again, her creative, witty talent!"
3,Flimsy Switch Contact,"Like others I like the design because I am often holding it with my teeth to leave my hands free. However, and this is not my first 2410, the contact arm is made of a very light material and after continued use will either distort or break so it no longer makes contact."
2,Royal Organizer,"I am not super thrilled with this because the screen is hard to read. Also, the batteries that came with it cost $11 to replace and they went dead within days of receipt.Oh well, it's only an interim solution until I can upgrade my phone to something that syncs with Outlook."
2,Royal electronic organizer,"One should not expect much from such an inexpensive item, but it was all I could find to replace my wonderful Sharp Organizer. It is difficult to use and when you do get some information in it some items, especially phone numbers are hard to read. I stopped using it and will keep looking. Not like the usually fabulous things I get at Amazon."
2,"Nice considering the price, but not suitable for my application","I needed a simple gadget to store phone numbers and addresses. The latter is no success: only one line is available to store the complete address. As a non-USA resident storing e.g. a USA address is not handy. The display of the address line only scrolls from one end to the other and vise versa. Also no PC software is include, but that's probably my mistake.For storing just phone numbers it is probably great value for money."
3,Not as good as the Sharp,I bought this item hoping it would be just as good or better than my old Sharp product. I was kinda disappointed. The product does have some good points but overall not as good as my old Sharp...
3,Royal Machines Organizer,I received it today. Having the hardest time reading the instruction on it. Can't figure it out too good. But I will call the manufacturer to see if they can send me a larger instructions on how to do it.
1,Not good !,Not easy to use! Quite complicated. Will not go to a drop down screen. Phone #s will read on the same line as address. Not good. I would recommended not to buy this product.
3,How I like the product,"I have a telephone/address book (electronic) that I have had for years. Since it's getting old I saw you item and ordered it. It is not like the ""old"" one but I think I'll get use to it."
2,Royal Machines DM&)&)R Organizer,IT HAS SUCH LIMITED MEMORY THAT IT IS USELESS AS AN ADDRESS BOOK. PERHAPS IT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE IF ITS LIMITATIONS WERE NOTED IN ADVERTISING.
3,Be trying to be organized,"I thought this was a great idea to keep addresses, that was until the battery died. I'd much rather keep my info on a storage device and plug it in my PC."
1,Instruction Manual defective AVOID!,"The machine seems OK, BUT the instruction manual is BLANK on every other page...no number or anything. I am low-tech and NEED this information. Called THREE times and each time they said they would send a manual via email or snail mail, but it never happened. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM."
4,Good replacement for my dead Sharp organizer,"I used my Sharp organizer for many years. I replaced it with another one when the first one died. When the second one died, I tried to find a replacement. The same model like the one I had, was very expensive and still, it was old technology. So I gave up on having a new one, till I saw the Royal organizer on Amazon. Now I have my phone numbers, and schedule and alarm, all in one place, and it fits in my shirt pocket. The packaging indicates that the organizer is from 2007.I've had the Royal organizer for a week now, and the battery is still working.I am thrilled to have this organizer, since it does a lot of things you find on a smart phone, without the expense of the high monthly phone bills. I went with a pay as you go phone. Some months, I don't use my cell phone at all, but it is there should I need it. The organizer will be used a lot and was really reasonable to purchase."
2,Not for Me,"I wanted an electronic address book. Though technically this holds addresses and phone numbers, I returned it. Too hard to read the smaller lines, and no indication of whether it is home, cell, or work phone."
3,Royal memo,I have found this product to be as it was described . I have found the dictionary part most helpful. It takes some time to enter reminders and addresses but it does the job.
2,Royal Machines,"Product worked OK, however we wanted to use them as telephone/address directories. The data storage capacity was far too small to contain several dozen address/telephone numbers. It could be the other (useless) functions of the device consumed most of the storage capacity."
2,ok.......,I should of listened to all the bad reviews because it was worst then that.I know that people want to be nice but I would but I can't that was a totale waste of my money.I hate people or companys that sell broken or not working products.It sucks.If you are looking for a way to waste your money here here!!!!If I could I would put in bold print here is the place to waste 20.00.I think I am done
2,This item was not what I thought it would be,"When I bought this organizer, I first thought it was what I had been looking for. It Does have a lot of good items on it for keeping info on it. But, one thing I was looking for was an ability to use small letters on it when recording e-mail addresses on there. There was no ""shift"" key on this to be able to do this. There were other reasons I would use capital and small letters too. This is why I sent it back."
2,You get what you pay for,"I was looking for replacement for a Sharp OZ organizer I had used for 15 years. Couldn't find anything close in Sharp, setttled on this. It is O.K., but limitede for my use as a calendar. It shows appointments, can't schedule a length of time. Can't look at the day/week/month at a glance. Limited, but I got what I paid for. Disappointing, nonetheless."
2,difficult to imput info,"I thought this item would be great, instead it's very hard to imput information, difficult to follow instructions. The instructions are not always correct or even helpful. I should return both of them, but it's just not worth worrying about.I had to throw them away, neither of us could use them, and I had several other people try to understand this also"
3,Royal Organizer DM7070R,"I have already had to buy new batteries less than a week after buying it and that is with limited use. The buttons are small,so I use my thumbs when keying information. Also it was a little hard to figure out how to use. But as an organizer, it serves its purpose."
2,disappointed customer,"Cannot use, so setting on a bookshelf in my home as description in write-up about alarm was not as it actually is. It has one ""beep"" and then a blinking light to let you know it is time for an appointment or to do something and I cannot really here it while in my work environment and I certainly can't just sit and stare looking for a blinking light to appear. Very disappointed."
2,It looked good in the write-ups,But when it arrived and I started loading data into it..I learned very quickly that the very small amount of storage it has makes it a ridiculous gadget. I sent it back because it simply don't have enough storage to make it worthwhile for any modern day use.
2,ok for overview but some test questions not properly edited,"I would have gave this 2.5 stars but there is no option to rate in half star increments. Some of the answers to test questions are not correct, or do not fully illustrate the solution (working the problem out step by step to help people learn the process or identify where they went wrong). Since people are using the software to learn it is CRITICAL that problems have correct answers and fully illustrated solutions. Also, you must have the cd inserted to run the program, but if you do not have it inserted there is no prompt to insert it, the program just refuses to run, and there is no error message either. This is problematic because there is alot of software nowadays that DOES NOT require the cd to be inserted, microsoft office being a prime example, so developers and publishers should not automatically assume that people will just know to have the cd in the drive."
3,MAC users beware....product description incorrect.,"The product description reads (Win/Mac).It is PC only....If anyone can recommend a good math tutoring program that is Mac compatible, please post it here.I am adding a 3 star rating due to a friends recommendation, not personal experience.Thanks."
1,an obvious agenda,what a disappointment!!! the Bush family and the entire cuban exile political structure equals the devil....fidel and raul castro etc..they're kind of cute !!! thats what Ann Louise would have us believe ! the betrayal at the bay of pigs is brushed over...I guess Ann figures a democrat was president and they are almost perfect...
1,Disgusting,"I did not rate this 0 stars since that isn't an option. I know some the people accused in this book and I will tell you this is a pack of LIES. Ms. Bardach makes things up or twists things to suit her purposes. Don't buy this book, take it out of the library and THROW IT AT THE AUTHOR!"
1,I guess anything gets published these days,"If you are sitting comfortably in your apartment or house on your PC or laptop enjoying theluxuries this capitalist society has afforded you, then please skip this book. However, for those of you who feel cheated by the fact that you've never had to deal with a totalitarian communist regime, then by all means you will enjoy the waste of precious trees that went into publishing Ms.Bardach's book. Even if you consider yourself a liberal, you'll be insulted by the author's take on Miami's Cuban anti-comunist population."
3,It should be Vengeane and Vengeance...,"There is little ""love"" here. the book should be titled ""Vengeance (in Miami) and Vengeance (in Havana)."" I won't say the book wasn't extremely informative and extremely detailed, but it was a bit too disjointed and confusing for me. Bardach gives you an in depth study of the Elian Gonzalez saga as it related to the politics in Havana and Miami during the time of Elian's 6 months in the States. I learned a lot... in fact I had to take copious notes just to keep up with the names and events. I finished reading it with some difficulty, but I didn't want to return it without reading Bardach's final take on the Cuban situation. The book ended while Fidel was still president and, as we now know, even though Raul took over, Fidel is still alive, kicking, and causing lots of trouble for all!"
4,This is a good book,"I really enjoyed this book. Most of what you hear coming out of Miami and Havana is incredibly biased to whatever it is you support. I found the author's approach fairly even handed. I do think she did herself some injustice by inserting opinions as though they were fact, especially in the Elian issue. Her insight into Jorge Mas Canosa was revealing and her balanced approach to the enigma that is Fidel was very good. I will probably re-read this and enjoy it just as much the second time around."
4,A Great Read!,"Bardach confirms, in this highly readable fast moving book, what I already knew about the rabid, Fidel-obsessed Miami Cuban immigrant community. There were some things I was not aware of that stunned me; the puppet courts of Dade County, the spinless Miami Herald, corruption of civil government etc... If she wasn't describing a city in my own country I don't think I would feel as repulsed as I do. Her scathing criticism of this community is relentless and does beg the question if she does have an axe to grind. Even so, if half of her allegations are correct, then this community is more insane than I gave them credit for.I've visited Havana but never Miami and after reading Cuba Confidential, I think I'll keep it that way!"
2,Not a fair assessment,"While the book has some interesting parts and is well-written, there is a lot of biased information to weed through. Every group has its extremists but the author seems to have a personal axe to grind with the Cuban exile community. Having lived among them in the past, I can't say that I agree with the stereotyping in this book as a blanket description of the community. Are they passionate about what they went through? Sure. That doesn't make them all drug dealing, corrupt wackos. None of the ones I met while living there ever were. They were just the opposite. Knowing this and reading the book made me sad for those who will read this material and believe it to be true."
2,Very Biased,"Cuba Confidential is an extremely biased book. Anyone with knowledge on the Cuban people will clearly see the bias against the exiled Cubans. This book portrays the Cuban american community as a bunch of extremist crooks who will do anything to get their agenda across. Of course in the Cuban community their are some extremists, but not to the point that the author makes it. This book seems to sympathize much more with Castro and his regime than with the Cubans here in the U.S. trying to live a free life. The book has very few unbiased facts. If you are looking for a completely objective book, this is not the one."
1,"Very Biased book, not really a Good Book On Exiles.","As a Child of Exiles, I know firsthand after reading and re-reading this, that this is not a Good Source on Cuban Exiles and the Cuban Experience,The author tries to be balanced, but could not get over her bias, and it seems her distaste of Cubans, The book makes me a little upset and I feel sorry for the Author. Cuban Exiles like anyone Make Mistakes, But this book seems like a Mouthpiece for Castroites,Lefties. It has biased sources, The book reads a Little like A SuperMarket Tabloid. It's up the reader to decide, but My Honest Opinion is that it's only book to check out at a library and not take very serious."
1,Ignorance about Cubans and Cuba,"Every time I read a book about Cuba I used a highlighter the inaccurate/incorrect statements before search for any sign of bias. This book has the record: +15 by page number 10 (i.e. US Cuban-American population = 100000; black population in Cuba = 70%, etc.). Her exhibition of ignorance about Cuba and Cubans is outstanding.It's amazing how easy some ""writers"" run to publishers with such a low quality material."
2,"Why is this ""Confidential""?","I found the book seriously incomplete and fairly biased in several respects. To argue that the Elian Gonzalez case reflects the views of the Cuban American community is, in a word, ignorant. Many Cubans in Miami in fact reluctantly favored sending this unfortunate child back to Cuba, in part because they understood that Castro would make political hay from the case. And he of course did. The recent spy cases, including the four ""diplomats"" sent back to Cuba this week by the US Government, underscores the extent to which Castro has infiltrated the US communities. Some of the most vociferous folks arguing to keep Elian here were in fact Castro ""plants"" who knew the impact and value of this issue to Castro. Most of the 1 million Cubans in Miami understood the politics and obviously were not among the 100 or so who paraded and hung out outside the house of Elian's uncle. And Cubans in Miami, notwithstanding this book, don't have a monopoly on corruption. ..."
5,It's NOT surprising....,"...to read the polarity of reviews with which Ann Louise Bardach's book has been received ... but actually reading them makes one think that there is some sort of ""agenda"" behind the dismissive or more vitriolic ones. CUBA CONFIDENTIAL is simply brilliant. It reads like a great detective story and I finished it (devoured it, actually) over 2 days. Anyone interested in Cuba, history, politics and future generations or descendents of the Cuban people should DEFINTELY not miss the opportunity to ""catch up"" on an amazing story."
4,The Unvarnished Truth Of The Matter,"I had the unique experience of living in the Cuban exile community for six years of my life. My ex-wife, daughter of Cuban exiles, provided me with a good introduction of Cuban morays and mindsets. I have just finished reading Ms. Bardach's book. I find it an unbiased and accurate account of the ongoing ""Cubiche"" drama played out in Puerto Rico, Miami, New Jersey, and anywhere else ""those crazy Cubans"" live and breathe."
5,Dark Mirror,"Have you noticed how most of the readers who disagree with this book use the basest language permissable to dismiss it? (ie. it's only good for toilet paper, etc). The reason they express themselves this way is because they don't have a bomb or molotov cocktail at hand to toss at the writer or her readers. Just the very fact that they are so intolerant of a different opinion and crass in their comments proves that just about everything Bardach states about the exile community in Miami is very likely true. Of course, there are those who live there who are not as vociferous, but I suspect they are the ones who quiver lest they say (or even think) something that does not agree with the Exile Agenda. Cuba Confidential does not take sides, it simply exposes the unfortunate truth: Little Havana has become a mirror image of Big Havana - except in Little Havana you get to wear more jewelry."
4,Indispensable for learning Romanian phrases,"This offers a lot! It offers conversation that goes beyond ""I'd like a room with a bath."" and ""Where is the nearest movie theatre?"" If I were going to Romania, this is definitely a book I'd take along! It has pronunciation tips, which help. In the back there's somewhat of a two-way English-Romanian Romanian-English dictionary which also helps. It doesn't cover grammar. For that see ""Romanian Grammar"" (ISBN: 0870528920), also by Hippocrene. It also doesn't come with tapes or CDs nor does it offer them. That's why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars."
2,BonJour Smart Coffee and Tea Brewer,"I was not happy with the shape of this tea brewer. The low rounded cup shape takes up more real estate on my desk than my previous mug-type brewer and gets in the way of my paperwork. The tea brewer often slid off its base that is meant to protect the surface it is resting on, resulting in wet surfaces and an unstable cup. I gave it to charity and bought another brand with the mug shape."
5,Great Little Coffee Brewer,"I've had this little drip coffee brewer for over a year now and have no complaints. I have used it at work, at home, and for camping. It doesn't leak, doesn't take on stains or odors, is unbreakable, and is easy to clean. It sits on a little coaster while brewing. The body of the brewer is then placed on the cup and the coffee is released with a twist of the top section. The brewer holds a generous mug and a half, or two regular coffee cups. The strainer in the bottom is stainless steel and unsnaps with a twist. I gave two of these to friends at Christmas and they are very happy with the performance of this great little coffee brewer."
2,Not so smart brewer,"My advice? Buy another model or if you already have this, recycle it. The engineers who designed this drip brewer must have had their head up their a%% or didnt do any product testing. The lid is a great idea but it doesnt tip back far enough to STAY open, dropping back easily. Very annoying. The lever operated dispensing unit is very drippy, making a mess. Be careful to push the lever tight. I recommend the Clever Coffee Dripper from Sweet Marias, even tho it has its own design flaws."
2,Started leaking not holding hot tea!?....,"In the beginning the idea & design worked for me,I really could not accept theplastic body for tea?one big flaw is too much plastic.Sorry.UPDATE -after 1,5 month started leaking,customer be aware""Leaking hot tea!!!""Not reliable-simply junk! not recommended"
2,I just do not see the appeal.....,"I mean the cases are bland, the acting wooden, and the writing non-existent. They say this is the highest rated cable show around, but i have yet to see any facts to back that up. I also can not stand Kyra's bad Southern accent."
5,"""SHE LOVES IT!!!""","I brought ""The Closer"" for my friend and though I'm not a follower of the series, she just adores it. She especially loves her favorite character, ""Brenda Johnson"" with her famous, ""Thank you SO much!"" phrase."
1,"Cheap, noisy, falls apart easily","I wanted to have a complete set of test probes and T-connection to use for my class because parts provided by school are old and not reliable. As it turns out, I think I would have been better off using those parts than this piece of junk. I wasted most of my time trying to figure out my output was noisy or not present at all. I went over my circuit carefully and everything was connected correctly. I tried using different wave generators and oscilloscopes, but nothing worked. I finally borrowed a T-connector and all my problems went away. This thing is so cheaply built that if you pull on the BNC connector just a little bit, it comes apart. Don't waste your money."
4,I love this program.,I am a vegetarian so getting alot of protein has been a problem for me. Not anymore! I have alot of energy and most important I am not hungry. But one question I do have when amd what kind of dessert do we get?
2,"So, what was that ""principle"" again?","Free radicals are bad for you because they are molecules that destroy your cellas and promote ageing and sickness. Wow.Unfortunately it would seem the evil stuff is everywhere so there is no real escaping our sad certainity of ageing and decay.Mostly it goes like that. One actually useful bit of info: avoid salami, sausages and the like.We get more substance once one reaches the inevitable My Recipies part. Let's see. OK, you are supposed to eat a little salad for lunch, a small piece of chicken for lunch with some veggies, and so on.Yeah right. You probably will lose some weight.Yawn."
5,Comments from Oregon,"I have lost 50 lbs. since the 1st of August. I began eating lo-carb when I read Suzanne Sommers new book and quickly switched to the Schwartzbein Principle after reading the Doctor's book. I am in my 50's, female, and have been very obese for years and have struggled with various weight loss methods all of my adult life. This book seems almost like a miracle to me. I have been taken off one of my blood pressure meds, I have more energy, I look and feel better and I don't crave sweets! I do intend to continue to follow the Schwartzbein Principle as closely as I can and I know that one day in the not too far future, I will be normal weight. I never thought that could happen. Thank you, Dr. Schwartzbein!"
2,schwarzbein principal,The book presents a lot of info but for the person looking to change eating style there is no clear IE table style presentation of how to follow the plan. The individual must read take notes and make their own which seems very cumbersome.
1,not applicable to all people,I have read this book and found that it does not really apply to everyone and can have negative effects on people who have certain medical problems. I do not recommend this book for certain types of eating disorders as it can cause tremendous weight gain. This diet plan does not work for everyone and should not claim to work for all people. Dr. Schwarzbein is an endriconologist who is not well versed in weight loss or certain medical problems
1,Liked THE MENOPAUSE DIET book better.,"I found a similarity between Dr. Schwarsbein's book and Dr. Larrian Gillespie's. But, The Menopause Diet was an easier, friendlier read that told me what I needed to know to fix my own diet and not some pie-in-the-sky, ""Gee, if I were only perfect,"" model. Everyone's different, but Dr. Gillespie explained how we get that way and what to do about staying that way, better."
1,This program made me GAIN 10 lbs,I followed this program very carefully and gained 10 lbs on it. Back to Weight Watchers for me.
3,The Schwarzbein Principle,Interesting concept but may be difficult to follow. I have not tried the plan but have heard of others who have been successful with it
4,"Great info, but need more . . .","Someone recommended this book to me. Very interesting information -- much of it counter to what I have been told in the past. I do not have severe weight problems, but my cholesterol numbers have slowly climbed over the years despite being on a low-fat diet for decades. I am skeptical. Every body is different, but I am giving the plan a try to see if it brings down the levels for me. Most of the book is scientific background and case studies. It feels light on the diet itself, 4-week menu plan and sample recipes. (Maybe the diet is just that simple?) To me it feels so radical that I ordered Part II and the recipe books for more information. Overall, it is a very interesting approach if you have tried other plans and found them unsuccessful."
5,Spectacular new road to optimal health and weight!,"Thank you, Dr. Schwarzbein, for a new body. In a year, by carefully following this simple, sensible, satisfying way of eating, I lost 97 pounds. My blood pressure normalized. My internist is amazed, and has me coaching his patients on The Schwarzbein Principle! My friends who have failed on other programs, or who have successfully lost weight only to regain it, have had the same wonderful experience with TSP that I have had. We think it should have been titled, ""The Schwarzbein Miracle""!"
5,This eating plan is great for PCOS women,"This book makes a lot of sense! Even though she disagrees with many of her contemporaries, Dr. Schwarzbein explains how high-carb, low-fat diets really affect our metabolism. Frankly, everything she says makes a lot of sense. This isn't a fad - it's balanced, healthy eating. I have PCOS, and I think this is perfect for a person like me, who is Insulin Resistant. I felt a difference almost immediately after giving up sugar. I'm looking forward to feeling better, and being more healthy, the longer I follow this eating plan!"
3,"Great book, except advice for soy for vegetarians","This is a great book, and I love most of the advice, and the testimonials that Dr. Scwarzbein had in the book. I agree with everything except the encouraging of vegetarians to use Soy. If you google Soy, you will see that it is NOT a healthfood. I do understand that some vegetarians will not eat animal protein--I get that. But I wish Dr. Scwarzbein had listed the right kind of Soy protein to get on this diet. Soy protein that is fermented is the only good kind of soy to ingest. Perhaps this is what she meant, but she did not specify this in the book. Most soy milks, tofu, etc. is made from unfermented soy and can be dangerous.My hope is that she makes changes in her book regarding this with perhaps a Scwarzbein Principle III in the future."
5,Good and bad carbs and fats.,"An easy diet plan that explains the difference between good and bad carbs, and good and bad fats, plus explaining the influence of food on hormone imbalances."
2,Not as good,"The book was a long string of examples how people were coming in the doctors officeand in the end she was managing to change them around for the better.What exactly those people did in daily habits and in numbers is missing.The doctor in her attempt to try to relabel the low carb dieting into something she discovered leaves out important information thatacould derail some people in their attempt to go low carb.Other books in this field are much better for example ""primal blueprint"" etc etc.Having said all that though it had some good information about hormones and the balance of those in the first chapters."
3,confused about cholesterol,"At first I really liked this book and thought it was informative and made sense for the most part. However, as a person with inherited high cholesterol I find her chapter, ""Why you must eat cholesterol"" unconvincing and this undermines the validity of the book as a whole for me. Now that the Reverse Heart Disease diet is mostly vegan,and the China Study advocates a vegetarian diet, I wish this information would be updated. I have her vegetarian book also, but it includes eggs and dairy. I guess each person has to find the right balance for themselves."
3,Can you loose weight?,"I have been researching this area of weight loss and nutrition philosophy ever since the Atkins diet came back into favor this past year. I personally do not believe that the Atkins diet is one that I can live by for a long period of time. The Heller diet (as featured on the Oprah Winfrey Show) seemed good but may also be a little far fetched. In my search for a middle ground I found the Schwarzbein Principle. I have yet to finish the book but I will say that my energy level has improved and my cravings have nearly stopped completely. While I would like to lower my cholesterol I really want to loose weight. I would like to hear from some readers that have followed the plan to loose weight - how much did you loose?, how fast? and have you kept it off?"
5,Amazing,This book is absolutely amazing with such important information. Definately makes sense. No more obsessive dieting for me it will ruin your health.
5,good book,This book is packed full of information regarding how bad sugar is for you. It has changed my eating habits. I have purchased 3 more copies of this book and given them to other people. The author also includes some recipes at the back for you. She gives you an eating plan to help get you on your way to healthy eating. Quite a few testimonials from people about how her plan has helped them.
4,Interesting reading but be careful,"After 4 month of limiting carbs to 100g per day, eggs every day, etc. I found I felt good, dropped a few pounds around my waist and lowered my blood pressure while eating all kinds of fat... but as I am 5-10 158lbs and work out 5 times a week, I did this to lower my cholesterol and not to really lose weight... my cholesterol went from 215 total with HDL 46, to 355 with HDL of 61 and LDL of 280 (recommended level less than 130). Not exactly what I was looking for. At least my triglycerides were good."
1,What am I doing wrong?,"I have faithfully followed this plan for over three months and have not lost any weight nor body fat. It is very discouraging because, although I realize that years of low fat dieting have destroyed my metabolism, I expected that I would see at least a little improvement, when I compare my situation to some of the example patients in her book. Although my blood sugars are normal, I had three gestational diabetic pregnancies. That was when I first began to gain significant weight, not before. Dr. Schwarzbein does not address this subject in her book, and I wonder if I am eating too many carbohydrates on the healing plan. My OB-GYN considers me a ""borderline"" diabetic, but Dr. S. says there is no such thing- you either are or aren't. So does a history of gestational diabetes, with normal readings between pregnancies, make me a diabetic? Does anyone know how to contact her?"
1,DANGER!,"After steadfastly following the Scwarzbein Principle for one year and two months, with ever worsening symptoms and weight gain, the final result for me is a diagnosis of ""fatty liver"", a condition that leads to cirrhosis and ultimately death. The book, ""The Amazing Liver Flush"", by Andreas Moritz, explains in depth why a high animal protein/fat diet caused this to happen to me. Please read the Moritz book before embarking on your path to destruction."
2,Not for everyone,"I would like to warn potential buyers that this book is not for everyone. I purchased this book online, hoping to find a healthy way of eating, and hoping to lose 10 pounds in the process. I read the entire book (I also purched the vegetarian cookbook, although I eat fish and chicken), and it seems that the plan is very healthy, but it would not work for me for several reasons. I am 24, and I do not make the kind of money one needs to live on this sort of diet (free-range animals and organic fruits and vegetables). I also do not eat eggs, which makes following the diet impossible. Does anyone who works 40 hours a week really have time to cook breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day? Basically, after having read about exactly how unhealthy and destructive my eating habits/lifestyle are, all I am left with is the feeling that the only solution to dying young is to quit my job so that I can spend all day thinking about what I'm going to eat for the next week. Very frustrating."
1,Audio is terrible,"The audio on this concert is horrible. It sounds as though a microphone was placed in front of a TV and recorded. I could do better with my old stereo from 1985.If you want to compare, listen to the bonus live tracks on the remastered It's Hard CD. The tracks are from the same show. On It's Hard's version of Eminence Front, the guitar solo is piercing and you can hear each of the members of the band clearly. On Live from Toronto, it is a muddled mess.I have to believe that Pete Townshend or Roger Daltrey did not play a role in this release, because it is third rate. This concert was on HBO in the early 1980's, and I was looking forward to its release. Now, I am disappointed I made the purchase."
1,Awful sound quality,"I have the dvd of this particular concert and was very excited to see that the audio had come-out on cd. However, the quality of the cd is horrible. I was really hoping to have a good quality cd because I had seen them on this tour. It's as if someone had simply recorded the the dvd from their tv set onto a cd. I can't imagine that personnel from The Who endosred this poor sounding cd. I also noticed that the cd wasn't even on MCA records (The Who's label). Clearly there was no re-mixing or preparing the audio for typical cd quality. It sounds nothing better than a run-of-the-mill bootleg. I was very disappointed when I played this on my stereo. If you have the dvd, just stick with that. As much as I love The Who, this was a total waste of money. It's very unfortunate that MCA didn't record this specifically for a cd at the time (in December 1982). It was a great concert from their last great tour."
5,A beautiful album!,"This, I am told, is the last album Doris Day recorded, and, it is absolutely delightful. The songs are all old and familiarstandards. Doris is, as usual, in excellent voice, and the arrangements are lush and appealing. From my point of view,Doris retired from singing much too early. Further, her movies were so successful that her singing tended to be undervalued, at least in the last 15 or so years of her career. For my money, she is absolutely among the best of the best singers ever. If you like good music, you can't go wrong with this one."
4,The Lost Album...,"...After the death of Doris's husband, Marty Melcher and during such a busy time filming for her CBS TV sitcom ""The Doris Day Show"", a newly recorded album was lost and forgotten. That was until 1994, when Doris Day released and promoted ""The Love Album"". These are laid back, lushly orchestrated songs that make for ideal lounge music. Not my favourite of Day albums but worthy of a place in your DD collection!"
2,Damaged CD,"this CD is great. The songs are nice, but there is a flaw in the recording that kind of ruins the recording, but I couldn't get out to mail it back. Too bad because it kind of puts a damper on the whole thing."
2,Cute but uncomfortable,"These shoes are really cute on, but I couldn't wear them for more than an hour...OUCH! My little toe kept sticking out from the side straps which were cutting into me. Unfortunately I wore them to work and was stuck with them all day. I couldn't wait to take them off. I would take them back, but my son threw away the box. I may attempt to wear again, but only for a very short time."
2,Haven't worn yet...,because the plastic packing stick stretchd them out and the strap barely stays on my ankle.
3,Not what I expected as an independent traveler,"This book has some excellent general information on traveling to and around London and includes several interesting walking tours, but I already have several tour guides containing this same information. I was looking for a book geared specifically to someone traveling alone - hotels that are safe and welcoming to the single traveler (particularly the single female tourist), restaurants where single patrons would not feel out of place, etc. I have been to London twice before as a single traveler and hoped that this book would enhance my next experience in that city. Although the book had very good over-all information for anyone visiting London, it had little to do with traveling independently. As a general London travel book I could have given it a higher rating, but had to settle for three stars as it did not help me any more than any other London travel book as far as advice for the single independent traveler."
2,overwhelming,"If you do not have a background in Indian history or are Indian yourself, do not buy this book. The book is great for those that know a lot about the evolution of India and that are familiar with all the terms in the book, however if you do not know what ""Mauryan"" means, do not waste your money. Each sentence has about 3 terms in it so you feel like you almost have to read it with a dictionary sitting next to you. The book is filled with lesser known details on history however, since it goes into such detail you may also find yourself wondering what the chapter was about in the first place. Definitely not for beginners."
5,Big Bang For The Buck,"I've had this unit about a year now, and find it to be performing no less than spectacular. It does everything it is supposed to, and does it very well."
4,Excellent Program,"I bought this program the other day. It is very intimidating with so many features, you dont know where to begin. I watched the video that came with it. The video helped a little.I bought this program to record a story that I wrote while inserting sound effects and music. After a few hours playing with it, I got it working to my satisfaction. I would have to say that this program is as complicated as Adobe Photoshop. If you are new to making music like I am, prepare for a huge learning curve, but it is worth it."
2,Nice loop library. Horrible interface performance.,"I have two versions of music maker: 6 and 11 deluxe.I'm just going to review the 11.Pros:-This programs has a lot of effects and ""tweaking"" capabilities such as: stereo, amp simulation, eq, reverb, etc.-Its relatively intuitive.-Tons of loops.-Cheap. Got in on sale at 9.99.Cons:-The program somehow WILL CORRUPT ALL YOUR PROJECT FILES. You won't be able to open them.That pretty much sums it all. Don't buy the program.I'm an amateur recording artist, and spent lots of hours recording my songs and the program won't even recognize the project files. I thought it was my computer, but I have re-installed the program again and again. Its a faulty program."
5,I like this Music Maker.,"This is the best product from the magix company I own and is a very affordable compare to Sony Acid and the loop collections from magix are affordable too. With this software you can built songs from jazz, rock reggaeton, 80's, 90's many styles, then you can upload your song to magix community and let other user vote for your songs and now you can upload your pictures and home movies too."
5,"Well Done, Robert","I found the book to be insightful on a variety of topics that many professional athletes wouldn't dare to touch--simply because they don't have the wisdom to articulate a thoughtful opinion on the subjects. And any criticism heaped upon the author for self-promotion of his ego should be balanced against both his skill on the football field and with a comparison to many of the self-serving books written (or should I say ghost written) by many contemporary athletes.The book is both frank and truthful. My only quibble is that I came away wanting more. Perhaps there will be a follow-up at some point.And, for the record, Robert Smith simply had the most elegant running style that I have witnessed on the football field. That long, loping, knees-high stride was a thing of beauty to behold.I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. We hardly knew ye'."
2,Somewhat Interesting....Not Very Intelligent guy,"A great RB, who explains why he quit the game....he got hurt too much.The book takes us through his amazing career as an athlete...Its not that the book is interesting. It is that, for a self-proclaimed ""the smartest man in the NFL"" there sure are alot of grammatical mistakes. Basic stuff like ""My mom and me"".And when he writes the essays on society at the end of the book, I had to put the book down. His thoughts travel from one subject to the next....mid-sentence.Don Banks of SI wrote an article about this book on 7/23/2004, that Robert Smith was a thoughtful, complex and an intelligent man off the field as he was intuitive on it.""Unfortunately, the book simply does not backup that opinion."
2,Pass On This One,"I was very disappointed in the overall content of the book. Very little insight into the game of football. The author's view of race, religion, and politics added nothing but a few pages to the length of the book."
1,Disappointing,"I trudged through the book hoping there would be some kernels of stimulating thought. But I never really found any. The same themes -- sometimes nearly the same sentences -- appeared over and over and over. Smith seems to want to capitalize on his football status as well as the idea that he's ""articulate for an athlete."""
4,GOOD SHOW,"The Amazon tracklisting is correct,but the cover art they show is from an older pressing. This is the sextet of Blanchard Harrison and Toussaint with a rhythm section led by Mulgrew Miller. This was recorded in May of 1985. After which the group went to England for some gigs like at Ronnie Scotts then returned for another gig at Sweet Basil in December adding a Trombonist to the group and recording among others NEW YEARS EVE AT SWEET BASIL"
4,"Perfect fit, great value","This is a great product and a more economical alternative to the WeatherTech brand. It fit my 2004 Grand Cherokee LTD is perfectly. Its nice and thick, so it seems like it'll withstand some abuse. It's shipped rolled up tightly in a box, so it took a couple of days for it to settle to the proper shape by adding weights to the corners."
1,Dimensions in Question,"Before buying be sure the dimensions are correct for your vehicle. There appears to be an error in the dimensions listed in the Amazon material for this item: 8.5"" x 8.5"" x 48"" ????? Can't be right...for an SUV cargo floor mat???"
5,GREAT!,I LOVE IT! I was so happy my daughter asked for this for Xmas because I enjoy playing with it. I went out and bought a bunch of Kelly friend dolls (the set doesn't come with dolls. The ferris wheel and coaster both work together at the turn of just one handle. It was easy to assemble and so much fun to play. It's also easy to take apart and reassemble. You'll love it too.
4,Surprised by the good quality of this toy,"I expected this toy to be poor quality, but have been pleasantly surprised. It is a VERY cute toy. You manually turn a handle on the back of the ferris wheel to spin the ferris wheel and to move the roller coaster conveyer belt upward. When the cars reach the top of the conveyor, they coast down and around (by gravity) for another turn. The only time I have had any problem with it falling apart is when you try to move it to a new location. But it is so easy to snap together and the connections seem very well-made and durable, that it isn't a problem. I would highly recommend this toy."
5,Lots of fun,"My 2 1/2 year old twins got this toy for Xmas and have had lots of fun with it already. They are able to work the crank (with some practice) and love putting all their small people toys in for a ride. Note: ""Little People"" don't fit very well. The crank does come off with vigorous use but is easily snapped back on."
5,must have toy!!!!!!!,"my 5 year old daughter recieved this from ""santa"" it was instantly her favorite christmas toy!! she wanted and also got the hot toys like diva starz and bratz.. but after we opened this one she didnt touch them again! excellent toy easy to do , no batteries required!! recomended to all!!!"
5,Fun toy,"I bought this toy for a five year old girl. She and her eight year old sister never really played with their kelly dolls, but this toy has inspired them to pull them out of the closet. Of all the toys she got (including Barbie travel train and Barbie pink corvette) this was her favorite. The handle on the toy kept wanting to come off, but a little super glue worked wonders. I would recommend this toy for any little girl who likes amusement parks."
2,Play ONCE!,They play with it for 2 minutes on the day they get it and will never play with it again.It is like paying [money] to watch and play with Barney. My sister almost never played with it and she is 6 years old.
4,Very informative,I bought this for my 10 yr old daughter who is fascinated by ancient Egypt. She's spent lots o time reading it and has found it very interesting and informative.
5,"A neverending visually stunning,intricate, guide to the mysterious world,of ancient egypt","Eyewitness guides were still,continuing to bring to,readers, books that had visually stunning intricate photos of priceless,jewels that,were still rich in glimmer,and,beautifully decorative in design of it,s artefacts,that,still,continues to,this day,without ageing at all in appearance something that only,archaologists or egyptee devotees,can't wait to find out in all about for it,s popular imagination in lengthy,stories and art.Which of course still,continues now,to be a, serious collectable gift,for anyone,needing to finding out,about ancient egypt's historic thrilling,neverending,past!"
3,a mom in Nashville,"I got this book because my 5-year old wanted to learn more about the ancyent Egypt. The images are pretty cool, but the information and contains are randomly written (maybe this is good for older kids that already know some about the ancient Egypt culture). However, you could get a better introductory book for 10 bucks more."
2,Not much replay value.,"It is a VHS,so quality is that of a VHS in extended long play mode. not a great picture."
2,Good basics but over 10 years old - not current,Book had some great basics concerning retailing and retail management. Current marketplace dynamic virtual environment. Book has no sections dedicated to the internet or cyber retail marketplace. Should be updated with reprint very much needed.
2,Not much new ground here. Badly edited.,"I was hoping that this would fill in gaps left out of other Lennon biographies. It does take some stands on issues such as Lennon's supposed homosexuality (this author votes ""no""), but the poor writing and editing hurt this biographer's credibility. Not knowing the difference between ""waste"" and ""waist"", and using ""compliment"" when it should have been ""complement"" makes the author seems like something less than a seasoned journalist. These are freshman-level grammatical errors that proofreading should have caught.Books on the life of John Lennon seems to have taken a cottage industry status these days. No single one of them is truly complete, but the lot of them makes a sloppy, overlapping patchwork quilt."
1,John would have laughed,"Lennon once made a comment to the effect that every two-bit hack associated with the Beatles would eventually get one book out of the deal, and in this case Kane is already on number two. Don't waste your time; if you want a real page-turner that brings up truly new insights, check out ""The Beatles"" by Bob Spitz, which is extremely insightful and well writen. I'm going to sell my copy of Kane's book: anyone interested?"
1,Lexar Compact Flash,"This item is not worth it. It's bulky, fragile, and is about the same size as my camera which means I'll probably leave it at home and not use it. The pitiful 16mb card should just be left out or at least substituted for one of acceptable storage size. Suggestion: pass on this one! There are other better solutions out there..."
4,Out of Egypt,"This is one of my favorite 'introductory' books into the gnostic traditions. I have it in paperback and cannot wait until it comes out on Kindle. For the advanced student, the book really begins in Part 3 with the Chapter 8 on Spiritual Practices. This is where the ""practical application"" kicks in after the ""lecture"" part of the book. I would like to see Mr. Smoley write a book that picks up from there."
2,Better Options,"Important subject, but disappointing book. I don't know of a great overview of the subject, just good individual statements. It may be that the subject actually resists summaries and overviews in favor of supporting the reader's own experiential journey. My personal thoughts on better places to start, each with their own angle:Jacob Needleman, ""Lost Christianity"" and ""The Indestructible Question""Cynthia Bourgeault, ""The Wisdom Jesus"" and ""The Meaning of Mary Magdalene""Elaine Pagels, ""Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas"" and ""The Gnostic Gospels""P. D. Ouspensky, ""In Search of the Miraculous"""
1,"ponderous psychology, not christianity","I was looking for a book that would explore some of the non-traditional thoughts and philosophies of Christianity to help me with some of my own struggles. This is not the book. One has to wonder what, if anything, Smoley beieves is actually true and historic about Jesus and Christianity since his writing clearly indicates he feels the bible is all myth and legend. I'm not a fundamentalist, but I also don't accept that the bible teaches us nothing more than how to relate to our inner being through some pretty far stretches of interpretation. Psychologists who are willing to endure a ponderously written text in order to learn how to write off every significant aspect of Christian beliefs, without threatening their clients, may like this. But those looking for an insight outside traditional religious thought to grow their faith should look elsewhere."
2,Light burned out after 3 months,For the price I paid I expected the light to last longer than the 3 months that it did. The magnification is great however since the light blew out I bought myself another wall mounted light for half the price that I am very happy with.
2,Lame light,"Love the magnification, but the light is lame. I end up using another lamp next to this mirror to see what I'm doing! Would not recommend."
3,Partly great,I liked everything about the light except it's fairly dim. It works well if the room is very light.
3,Great product !,The light on this mirror is very bright and useful ! I also like how this folds away for easy space saving when done being used.
3,Quite heavy for air travel,"This is a very substantial mirror. I purchased it for an international trip, however, it is very heavy and bulky, so I won't be taking it when I travel abroad. It would probably work great for home use or perhaps a road trip."
4,FUN,I totally agree with the first review. I play it all the time. I just wish it had some well-known pro players in the game.
1,unsatisfied,the book was advertised as one edition and it was actually different. it caused me additional time and expense to return it and re order one that was better addition not happy
2,There MUST be a better way to teach policy!!!,"This must be the MOST boring Policy book I have ever read! Most of the information covered in the beginning of the book is review material (how the US Legislature works, etc.). The rest of the book focuses on the methods and ways to change/enact policy. If you read the first sentence of every paragraph, then you will be fine. The rest is just too redundant and boring. If you are interested in Hurricane Katrina and Policy, this book provides numerous illustrations and articles regarding what was done, should have been done, and what was NOT done before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina. The earlier editions do not."
3,Cepracol,Still have not received product. It was ordered on Feb. 8. Shipper has agreed to reship. Sure hope it arrives soon.
1,It won't work!,"I used one powerglove for a month and it was sporadic at working and then quit entirely. Amazon sent a free replacement. It did the same thing. I couldn't get it to turn on, then after 8 minutes or so if it did turn on I couldn't get it to turn off. It needs major redesigning. I like the concept and it was comfortable but that's about all. Barbara Baxter"
2,Not easy to use!,"I had great hope for this item after reading reviews, but found that it didn't function as described, and that the three buttons that control it are so close together that my fingers were unable to press them individually...and I have tiny hands. It's a great idea, but needs a re-design before I could use it."
5,the power!!!!!!!!1111,"I own one and bought one for my mom, it's convenient and accurate. I recomend it, thanks!"
4,Works for me,I use this product exclusively for the heart rate monitor while walking. My package said there is a software update and I had no problems with the powerglove turning on and off with one push. I love the display; it's bright and looks cool at night.
5,badass,"fits perfectly on my hip and i really love the tension adjuster , so you get just the right amount of resistance when drawingworth every penny"
5,OUTSTANDING Holster!!!!,"Outstanding Holster for my Ruger GP100, 4inch.Love this holster. Fits great and rides nicely on my hip.Very snug fit and holds Revolver securely without problems on draw.This holster will be great during the Zombie Apocalypse."
3,Fits securely,"When I initially bought this I had the stock iron sights on my gun and the holster worked well. It was a little tight when trying to draw the pistol out but I assumed it would break in. Since then I installed fiber optic sights which sit a little higher. Now the front sight hits if I'm not careful. The holster can be loud if you don't draw slowly, so not great for hunting."
5,Very Nice,"I have had a bunch of guys give me flack abotu this item as it is inexpensive and kind of plasticky looking. To be honest I was not impressed when I received it. However, after wearing it for a few days, my mind was changed. This is a very nice piece for the price. The backing is large enough so keep the gun flat against my side and hold the weight very well. Mine is a 4"" barrel GP100 so a longer jacket is needed to hide the weapon but for cold weather use it is perfect. The draw is easy and adjutable by loosening or tightening the screw on the side.Very nice product for the price. I even bought another one for anotehr weapon I have"
5,<3 loved it!!,Great love story!!! My favorite author!! Josie returns home to try and face her ex after a terrible accident remembers why she fell in love with him and he doesn't recognize her since her change in appearance after the accident. The change in hair and all. Then he figures it out. A great read!!!!
5,Another a great read,"As of most of Susan Mallery's book, this was a delight to read. she keeps you interested as to what will happen next. It is an easy read. Hope others will enjoy it."
1,I just don't understand????,I wonder: How can anybody do such a lousy movie???????Well it's done but the worst thing is that I paid money to rent this movie.One of the worst films ever made. rating: 0 out of 10
1,In a word.... ughh...,"A dog... I'm not surprised to see Pauly jump on the bandwagon since his career's been somewhat in the dumps these days. If you want to see a good ""Blair Witch"" satire/spoof, check out ""The Blair Witch Rejects"" or ""The Oz Witch Project"". Both of them a thousand times funnier and more clever..."
4,Ohhhh...scaaaarrryyy,"A spoof of a spoof of a spoof...common...it's pretty funny to see the ""serious filmmakers"" of the ""Blair Witch"" phenomenon made fun of...and some of these directors do it pretty well. It's worth a laugh or two. Better than the original anyway. The Willie Witch Projects is the best of the bunch."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,This has to be one of the worst movies ever! Its not funny and it is not entertaining. Waste of time and money. Do not be deceived by the fact that Pauley Shore is in one of the segments of this movie.
2,Um....why?,"Ok, I know there were lots and lots of Blair Witch parodies, but these were the worst and most I dunno...stupid, I have ever seen. They're basically the same thing, over and over. And what's up with this channel Woods thing? All of those little commercials had to have come up by drunk people. The reason I gace this 2 stars is for the last parody. It's the only thing that got my laughs in the whole show. I usually don't give bad reviews, so I'm feeling bad for doing this, but I did it. I do recommend you rent it for the last parody!"
4,Pauly Shore... Well its on of his better ones,"The bogus witch project is a very, very, cheesy take of the Blair Witch Project. It takes us through parks in search of big foot and through the streets of Watts in search of the Watts Bi**h.While it is a very humourous take of the Blair Witch Project it seems to be donbe with a very low budget and well Pauly Shore... but other than that it is well worth a few laughs."
2,unncessary software...,"I read a tutorial for converting VHS to DVD and it suggested a program such as this one. I bought a capture ""card"" and with it came software to do basic capturing and editing... all that this did. It comes with cheesy fade screens that I guess some who are into that stuff would love, but that's about it. It wasn't compatible with my capture card/system and didn't read my sound card so I couldn't use the program to actually capture, just edit. This box is just sitting in the corner now since I have no use for it."
5,It can't be as bad as Pinnacle's Video Creator Platinum.,"Trying to install Pinnacle Video Creator Platinum caused headache and many wasted hours. I even set the compatibility in Windows Vista to be compatible with Windows XP, to no avail! However, Honest Technology's Video-to-DVD Deluxe states distinctly ""WINDOW VISTA READY"" and also includes the interface box between VHS player and computer. At least Honest Technology offers a Vista ready product so soon after Vista's release, and I commend them for that."
2,"A bit dissapointing, but still a nice doll","I bought this doll, mostly because I loved her beautiful gown, and because she looked nice in her box. I got home and unpackaged her, only to find that her dress was completely sewn together and there was no way to get the dress off the doll! I then tried to put her on the stand, and the seam holding one part of the dress came undone! She is still a beautiful doll, and has great face paint. Her gown is still pretty, but if you are planning on putting it on another doll, or putting another outfit on this doll, forget it! You must be careful with doll when putting her on her stand, because the part holding up the skirt is cheaply sewn together. She does make a lovely display doll, but don't buy it for children to play with."
5,A concise text on sinus grafting,"Dr. Jensen presents a very well organized text on one of the most frequently used bone graft procedures in implant dentistry. It is a book for the uninitiated as well as the seasoned implant dentist or surgeon. It illuminates the different grafting options in very great detail, and substantiates them with quality research. This is a ""must-have"" for any implant dentistry practitioner."
2,uh...,"The story line is great and everything, but the writing is terrible! I found million of ways that the story could have been more decriptive and definetely better written. I'm 16 and I could have written better than that when I was 12. If you don't mind poor wrting style, then go ahead and read the book. The storyline was fantastic, but it sorta seemed kinda rushed."
4,The Decision Between a Vietnamese and an American,"A girl born in Vietnam has fallen in love with a buffalo herder who has seen the mayhem in the war. The girl, Loi lives on the streets. The buffalo herder Khai is whom she has fallen in love with instead of an officer. Those thoughts have been trailing the minds if Loi should leave her family to have a better life in America."
5,Pretty Close to Perfect,"This may not be the ultimate Gordon Lightfoot collection imaginable(it was released before ""Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"" was recorded - for that you need ""Volume II""), but it comes darn close. Words can scarcely describe the effect that this collection has on a listener; Lightfoot has a storytelling, melodic magic that transforms the audience to another time and place. It's music that evokes powerful images and memories...just read the other reviews contained here to get a sammpling of what I mean! Whether he's been part of your life for decades or this is the first time you've heard him, you'll be hooked...it's a desert island disk."
4,Sends You Back,I remember when I was growing up in the 70's we lived in the country in New Mexico and my dad used to have some of Gord's albums and played and sang his songs on the guitar. Since then whenever I hear his music it reminds me of those days. I found the album on cassette but have since worn it out and none of my vehicles has a cassette player in it. I've never heard much about the man who wrote and sings these songs but I feel that a small generation of people like myself will never forget them.
3,Overlong anthology,"Gordon Lightfoot's best material, like ""Sundown,"" ""Carefree Highway,"" and ""If You Could Read My Mind,"" is among the best singer-songwriter pop from the 1970s. Unfortunately, the rest tends to be fairly bland, and ""Gord's Gold"" is at least twice as long as it needed to be. Additionally, the epic masterpiece ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,"" is not even included. This may be a great album for Gord's most ardent fans, but we casual listeners need a more stripped down version."
1,Gord's Gold? NOT!,"At the risk of ticking off the ""serious"" Lightfoot fan, let me just say this: What is ""Gold"" about an album that excludes the man's BIGGEST hit? For better or worse, Lightfoot is known for the epic, ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald."" In a clear ploy to get you to buy more of his albums, that tune is conveniently absent on this ""Gold"" album. I mean, really. Would you exclude, ""American Pie"" off Don McLean's Greatest Hits? I was suckered into buying this album. Don't make the same mistake."
4,"great music, great memories","I had to laugh when I read the review titled ""Gord is good for kids"" _ he sure is! I had an almost identical experience of growing up listening to Lightfoot each Saturday doing chores around the house, dancing while dusting and polishing. Dad was a huge fan of Gord's and would always play his albums through the weekend. To this day Lightfoot's songs still sound like the uncomplicated happiness of childhood to me, even though the sweetness of his tunes is almost always undercut by sad and lonesome lyrics. And I still think ""The Pony Man"" (which is actually on Gord's Gold vol. 2) must be one of the most beautiful lullabyes ever recorded. Glad to know I'm not the only second generation Gord fan out there. And anyone who likes folk or country music at all should pick up this album!"
3,Good Songs - Poor Quality.,"Gordon Lightfoot is without a doubt a great songwriter but the quality of this cd is terrible. It's no better than a mediocre cassette. The high frequency is clipped causing it to sound flat.'Sundown' is one of my favourite Lightfoot songs but all these selections show a sensitivity not found too much these days. The only remastered album I can find is an import which doesn't have most of his material I like. Oh well - if this gets remastered, I'll buy it again."
5,Great Lightfoot Songs,"This was one of the best buys I've ever found, not only a great price, but I have been looking for this album for a long time. Thanks Amazon."
4,Remaster in order,Been a GL fan for decades and learned to play guitar with every songbook I could get my hands on. Love the re-records but wish they had included 8th Ave on the cd. I got around this by taking it off the vinyl and compiling my own cd. Looking forward to a remaster of GG which I will immediately buy
4,Wow Thw Memories!,"When I was growing up, my first girlfriend and I had the song ""If You Could Read My Mind"" as our song. I never thought to buy the album though. When I was in the military, about 1984, a friend gave me a self recorded cassette recording of Gord's Gold. I listened to that tape until it broke. It outlasted the first girlfriend though. I have been looking for it on CD. Now that I have it, I remember how crisp and solid these folk songs are. I am imnpressed at how many of the words I still know. It is always good to hear great songs that the oldies radio stations seem to overlook."
3,Some thoughts on half of a great album....,"Since 1968, I have followed this masterful singer songwriter.I have thoroughly enjoyed this recording. That being said,it is frustrating that Warner/Reprise has not remastered Gord's Gold, because one can hear how blurred the sound is, especially the UA material. You can HEAR the difference in the sound, if one has the 4 CD Songbook, regarding the remainder. This may sound like heresy, but I suggest skipping Gord's Gold, Vol 2. That is the only disappointing rerecordings of the incomparable originals."
1,Terrible Product,"I completely agree with the other reviewer. I have not found another skin for the Zen Touch, so I purchased this one. Before I could even get it to work, the skin ripped. Stay away!!"
1,The Worst skin out there,"This skin is just a plain waste of money. The rubber is made way too cheap and doesn't even stretch enough to put your player in. The other items that come with it just feel and look cheap. This case rips very easily. When i was trying to put it in My Zen Touch it ripped right on the corner where it holds everything in. I wouldn't recommend buying this product. It doesn't even come with instructions on how to put it in right, even though it is self-Explanitory. The only good thing about buying this item is the shipping is way fast. I got mine the day after i ordered it."
1,haynes manuals,"haynes manuals are for amatures, the majority of info needed is not given, insted you are referred to your repair shop, not why you would buy the book."
1,haynes manuals,"Haynes manuals are for amatures; the majority of info that is needed is not given. Instead, you are referred to your repair shop, this is NOT why you would buy the book. I also misunderstood in thinking this book covered a Ford A4OD trans."
4,De-mystify working on your Ford Tranny,"Using this manual, I was able to easily disassembly and rebuild my C6 transmission using basic tools with limited need for ""specialty"" tools. The book explains in detail what to do for each transmission, what special tools you'll need and what special tools you WON'T need. I bought the overhaul kit from a local shop, this book and a few simple tools I needed an excuse to buy and I was off. The book has good info on diagnosing problems as well as very detailed step by step instructions with pictures. A very useful tool for the home mechanic."
4,Pretty Good Shop Manual,"I've been a car guy for a lot of years and recently decided to attempt to rebuild my first automatic transmission. I bought this shop manual to help me with the process. The manual is very easy to follow with step by step pictures showing disassembly and reassembly. I also bought a CD showing the same process on video. Rebuilding an automatic transmission isn't easy and definitely not for the inexperienced. If you want to give it a try, I recommend this manual and would buy it again."
2,disappointed,"this manual is not very detailed,if you were to work on the valve body for instance,this manual is useless.also the troubleshooting is way too basic,no details,the symtoms and possible problem sources are not detailed,i think this manual could have been a lot better."
2,Not real thorough book,"This book only really covers tear down and build up, There is not a lot of inspection. I really don't see the point of rebuilding a transmission just to put bad parts back in. Not a lot of pictures on the build up side either. I think that I expected more because I have used ASTG transmission manuals before. I would save your money and buy an ASTG manual."
2,Great for older Fords,"In its prime, this was probably a good manual. However, time marches on and this manual has not kept pace. The newer Ford automatics from the early 90's on are not covered. If you want info for earlier models, this would be a good reference, otherwise, you'll likely be disappointed."
3,Is this the old recipe (pre- 2006) or the new one?,"The picture indicates that this is the old, awesome tasting Chi-Chi's Fiesta Salsa. Around 2006, they switched to a much blander recipe, and the packaging changed as well. I've been to other websites where the picture shows the old kind (as it does on this page), only to find the new recipe, to my dismay. Can anyone vouch that the container actually reflects the picture here? If so, I'll buy a dozen. That salsa was the best I've ever had; it's such a shame they abandoned such an amazing recipe.Edit: I should have added this a while ago--when I received it, it was the newer, blander recipe. I've since contacted Chi-Chi's, and they've told me they've unfortunately abandoned the old recipe :o("
5,Hendrickson at her best,"Emily Henridckson is one of the finest Regency authors around, and her descriptions of gowns, etc. are mouth-watering. Her characters are always superbly drawn and sympathetic, except for the vilains and villainesses, of course, and they we LOVE to loathe. This book gives hours of enjoyment, and a completely satisfying ending. I'm now ready and eager for Hendrickson's next. May it not be long in coming."
1,badly done,"Lord Hendrickson breaks the first rule of a good regency by ignoring the customs of the period. The plot is set in motion when a nobleman wills his fortune to his male heir, but wills his title to his daughter. Not possible. Titles were never at the disposal of the holder. There were very rare cases, such as that of the first Duke of Marlborough, when there was no male issue, and the family was well connected at court, when a daughter's son inherited the title by special dispensation of the Crown. The second absurdity is that we have a countess, the widow of a wealthy man, left virtually penniless. English law prevented such a thing. No man could die in England without leaving his wife a specific and quite generous proportion of his estate. If he wrote something else in his will, the courts overturned it.The book is also poorly written."
2,Acronyms in Paradise,"If you believe that a Computer projection of Hurricane's behavior is better than human evaluation,then this is your book.Jack Williams of USA TODAY gives us a dumbed down version of science that his newspaper specializes in.Want a terrible sounding MEOW?Well, a computer can do it for you without any reference for historical record.I recommend reading Dunn's ATLANTIC HURRICANES or even Hearn's CHITA so you can start evaluating Hurricanes on your own terms."
4,Almost Great,"I bought this book based on its subtitle (Essays on Faith and Fiction) and on my appreciation for Ron Hansen as a faith-filled writer. I expected it to be more about the integration of faith and fiction, and I loved the sections dedicated to that topic. As an author myself, I feel a kinship with Hansen in that I too write fiction from a faith perspective. I felt a little bit cheated by the chapters on Hansen's family members, but moved deeply by the story of the murdered Jesuits in El Salvador. That's why I rate this book ""almost great."" I don't fault the author but rather my own expectation that it would be something more than it was. All in all, I'm happy to have the book in my library, and much of it is highlighted in yellow."
4,Much of what I expected,I could not give 5 stars because the reading is sometimes confusing relative to what fractal it is refering to. Adding to that the mathematic definitions are not very strict although it can be a positive point to some readers.I liked the amout of descritive details about every case of study and the inovative aproach about the geometry of nature.I recommend this book for the ones who want to get a first glimpse towards fractals.
4,Fractals are hard,"It's a difficult but insightful book. Mandelbrot explores applications of fractals in advanced topics of many disciplines. So don't expect to understand everything. The best way or reading this book is to pick the chapters that are more accessible to you, independent of their order. Fractals are a hard but fascinating topic. It might take some time to develop an intuitive idea of fractal dimension, but once you do it you'll see the world with new eyes."
4,"Good, one of the first, but not the best","The book is still a milestone in the history of fractals, but it gets currently lost among the many available publications. Surely a good book, but there now exist other texts that can be considered more advisable to a reader, particularly to a computer-oriented one."
4,A fractal is by definition,"A set for which the Hausdorff Besicovitch dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension.The definition of a fractal pretty much sets the tone for the book. There are mostly definitions and monochrome diagrams to explain the more classical fractals. The book does shows some practical geometric uses for fractals but I would not let it get anywhere near my Koch Curve.I am not being kind to this book as there is a color section in the center. That shows ""The Great Wave"" by Katsushika Hokusai (1760-12849.) And an extensive reference section.The book its self could easily be used as a text book for school.Fractals: Hunting the Hidden Dimension (Blu-ray) [Blu-ray]An Eye For Fractals: A Graphic And Photographic Essay (Studies in Nonlinearity)"
2,A review on the book -- not on Mandelbrot,"Mandelbrot is the person who introduced the fractal theory to the world in its present form. Many fields of science including geophysics have gained from fractals. However, this is not the book one should read to gain knowledge on the subject.It is not an easily readable book. 1. It is not well-organized 2. It does not cover necessary things in detail 3. Frustratingly long in some parts. Instead the books: Feder, Fractals; Turcotte, Fractals and Chaos in Geology and Geophysics can be recommended.Fractal geometry may be interesting as a historical book, after one gains a sufficient knowledge on fractals."
3,A dated but still fascinating book,"This was the book that first caught my attention. It was the cover diagram: a figure the like of which I had never seen. One thing led to another until I finally wrote my own application of fractals, Fractals in Music.Mandelbrot is an odd character, but a superb thinker. His book does not offer a lot of science, but rather a compelling view of how this fascinating and growing topic developed. I recommend it highly."
3,It's OK but....,"Benot Mandelbrot is unquestionably a great savant but he should have taken some lessons on how to write books.There is an intense feeling of disappointment after reading this book and it is hard to pinpoint why. It's all there: nature in a wondrous new light. An original work which almost singlehandedly (well... almost) spawned a new field, a field which is not only beautiful but immensely useful as well. The discourse is not too complicated and it is not simplistic pap-science either. Yet there is something missing, a passion or what some might call 'heart'.When I pick up a book about fractals, even when it is a highly technical work like formal fractal geometry, there is always a certain sense of excitement, of dabbling with a new and beautiful toy. You won't get that feeling with this book.I still recommend it, in fact I think that it is a must-have if you are serious about this topic, but don't expect too much excitement."
4,Good tea,My favorite of this tea brand is the Scottish Breakfast tea. Though this tea is good also. I thought I would expand my Horizon and am trying this one. Again it's good but not my favorite.
5,A great Book for beginner,"Well, If you are a beginner (Like me...), this book is for you~It gives u a general idea of the most common thoeries related to the everyday harmony of popular music.However, you need to find and read some more after finishing this book~"
4,Excellent for fast comprehension and practice learning,"This is an exelent tool, for beginner musician, interested in a professional music study, after you have read this book, you'll be able to understand music theory concepts and jazz basic theory knowledge."
2,Say what?,"We're using this in a senior music theory class. So far it's pretty confusing for most of the class. These are mainly retired educators so it's not a shabby group. It seems to be consistently just shy of enough information to give you a reasonable understanding. I find myself going back to my Music Theory for Dummies book to figure things out. Music Theory for Dummies appears pretty comprehensive but I don't know what else is out there. If we didn't have an instructor to expand on and clarify the book, we'd be up the creek. On the plus side, it appears to be sort of ok for the purpose given there is not much to read but several exercises. In reading the rest of the reviews, I suspect they are plants. I mean we even have a retired Physicist who gets confused in chapter 4 on intervals."
3,50% workbook...,"I'd just like to note that this book is about 50% workbook. About half of it is quiz fill-in. Which is great if that's what you want, but if not, it's an annoyance, and it doubles the size of the book.I'd like a complete, concise, and well laid out theory reference book for guitar...and this is not that."
5,sizing and general,"really fly looking shoes, very clean and people like them.on the sizing issue i wear a 11.5 nike and i used that to order these and i would say they fit very close to my nike shoes.another cool thing is the box they come in looks like a display case and adds a bit of flare to them.get them while there hot."
5,Wonderful Book on Signs and Symbols for Dreamtime & Realtime,"I have had my copy of this book for well over 5 years and without a doubt I can say this is the best book I have ever read on dream interpretation. And this is not only a book on Dreams. The Secret Language of Signs also encourages you to look for signs and symbols in your waking life, which you will find are easily as abundant as the signs in your dreaming life.The first four chapters of this book are dedicated to helping the reader discover how to work with signs and symbols in waking life as well as the dreamtime. The bulk of the book is a remarkable dream dictionary which gives a great starting point in working with symbols, but is not so specific as to be either limiting or ridiculous.I find Miss Linn's writing enjoyable and easy to understand and would highly recommend this wonderful book for both the beginning and advanced dreamworker."
4,Leaves you thinking,"I've had this book for years! I can't tell you how many times I've referenced it and how many times it was accurate. I remember most things that I've referenced in it, but still like having it around just in case. I only wish it had more signs indicated."
3,Reader From PA,I was interested in the book when I was able to look inside and read some of the pages. The book was alright but I did not realize that half the book was a dictionary for signs and I think it could of been a little more interesting.
5,Signs are ALL around you....Start paying attention!,"They're the most useful things you pay no attention to. When dealing with signs and symbols, you may experience an emotional, psychological and spiritual resonance. This occurs when the symbols connect with your inner self. signs also communicate large ideas in order to bring people together in loyalty, obedience, love or fear. One example of a symbol is the war in the Middle East. It does not matter if your experience or attitudes about the war are different from another's. This symbol evokes great emotion. Today, people fight and die for their individual emblems or flags. In this war, the combatants may be Americans, Europeans or Middle Easterners, yet all are willing to die for what their respective symbols represent. All of these people have come from different societies, yet their symbols are powerful enough for a person to risk their life. While some symbols are universal, others are specific to a certain culture or a different time period."
4,50's small big band jazz,"surprisingly modern jazz, due to garcias creative arranngements and tunes. many of the best muscisians of the day.playng at their best"
4,"Great price, now just to figure out how to configure it","Great price for this PCI card, but after weeks and not reading the manual thoroughly; still trying to figure out how to configure them to get them to work on my network"
4,Pet Shop Of Horrors,Pet Shop Of Horors is one of the best anime i have seen in a long time. It`s dark fantasy meets horror movie. The only bad thing was it was to short. I can`t wait for vol.2
5,Excellent and Suprising,"This DVD features all four episodes of the Pet Shop of Horrors series. I would say that this is wrongfully named. The horror doesn't come from the pet shop, but the weaknesses of the human owners. The 3rd and 4th episodes actually have a sweet twist at the end."
4,Wow... Umm...,"Well, this is hardly the most original series in the world and certainly not the scariest but it is extremely good. It really is. It creeped the hell out of me when I borrowed it from my friend, and it usually takes a lot to do that. The first episode is the worst and least original- the entire episode I kept thinking, ""Humm, where have I seen this before??? I wonder???"" (in the least sarcastice way possible, of course.) It does scare you, though. I personally thought the Medusa episode was the best, though; very effective at getting across the characters of the main victims (as I like to call the poor souls who go in Count D's shop-what other name is there?) I would probably watch it again just to see things I missed the first time, but I would rather read the manga than see it a third time; everybody I know tells me the manga is even better."
5,Only Knifes I will Buy,"I LOVE RADA knifes, I have owned mine for 5 years. Holds a good edge (although with any knife you have to sharpen from time to time)recommend getting a sharpener. Don't put in the dishwasher, only hand wash or it will dull the shine of the knife. HIGHLY Recommend these if you want a knife that last."
5,best knife,"Having received a smaller Rada knife for a gift, looked them up on Amazon as I was most pleased with the smaller knife. This size far exceeds my desires. I have had all sorts of expensive knives and this is far superior. It sharpens very well and is very easy to clean."
3,Is This a live album?,"Listening to this I have the sense that it is live.The playing isn't that good, and Dave Walker was alwaystheir worst vocalist. That is why their record sales wentdown in the mid seventies. The covers of their old standardsdidn't do them justice. I saw Savoy at the hight of their career.This record sounds like a poor immitation. There are too many5 star ratings of 2 & 3 star records. Come on people the publicbuys these based on your reviews. Be honest.I know the music today sucks, but back in my heyday this record would have beena big disapointment."
4,"Great, but one little thing","The jar is wonderful and seals well, my only very small issue with it is that the lid can come off if the back metal parts aren't secured very well. You can put it back on, no problem, but that's my only criticism. I would order the jars again, so no biggie!"
1,Junk,"Where in the world was this made? The lid fell off in 1 week due to the poor construction.The thin wire holding the hinge in place quickly bends and hey presto, falls on the floor.STEER CLEAR"
1,Latching mechanism comes apart,"This is a terrible product, and I regret having bought it.I bought one of these to hold some natural facial cleanser, because the jar that it came in was made of cheap plastic and not airtight. Unfortunately, it hasn't lasted me very long. The wire latching mechanism eventually came apart, and it wouldn't close properly after that. A total waste of money."
5,"Great quality, air tight, perfect for most storage","I use these jars for storing coffee, beans, cereal, and more. I have approximately 10 of these jars and have had no problems. After about 6 years, I had to replace some of the gaskets, which are available inexpensively. They are airtight, unlike many of the plastic jars. Glass is inert so there is no worry about contamination from plastics, though there is a possibility of breakage (knock on wood, hasn't happened yet.) Highly recommend."
4,herb jar,"I use it as an herb jar, does a decent job keeping fresh picked herbs fresh some still dry out in it a little faster than I would prefer, though it woorks better than any jar I have used before it..."
1,disappointed,"Add read 17- 1/2 -ounce , which I thought meant 17 jars. The price was only for 1. I could have gotten it cheaper here or Shopped somewhere else."
5,Great item,Item was just as described and exactly what I was looking for. I was dissapointed to find a few of these at much cheaper costs after the purchase though.
3,Not a bad album...,"I heard these guys on a sampler I bought earlier this year. The song ""Sundowner"" was on it. I found myself really getting into the song. So when I saw this album for about three dollars at a local record shop I decided eh, what the heck might as well give it a listen to.Now the thing about this album is that a lot of the songs start to blend together after a while. I think this may be partially due to the frontman's voice. Don't get me wrong, I like his voice. But it seems to overpower the instrumentals very often in the songs. If you like bands such as ""Silent Drive"" and ""Vaux"" you'll probably enjoy these guys.Like I said, it isn't a bad album, it just seems to get a bit repetitive after a while."
5,Hot Damn!,"This Cd is Incredible!!!!!!!!!1 all i have to say is go out and buy it, this band is sooo awesome, with really deep lyrics."
4,I thought this was compromise - at first,"Strike integrity down as you listen to this CD with repeated times on yo playa and it's like eating a dinner plate. That's what I get for purchasing this CD for $15, window-shopping at a local HMV store not too far away on where I live. Purchased this immediately as soon Alexisonfire was gaining commercial momentum on Equal Vision records. Don't wear this name down to yo punk-ass. It's true. It's coming to a city / town near you.Be a sucka and give this a chance. It's a beginning."
2,Did not hold up,"I have own this product for nearly 2.5 years and just threw it away. Despite following care instructions explicitly, this iron developed problems fairly quickly. The steam adjustment function stopped working first so that it was almost impossible to vary the steam quantity. Then, about 1.5 years into it, it starting having problems keeping the steam pressure. I had to turn the iron off and on again to rebuild the steam. Then, about 2.5 years into it, it started leaking hot steam and water out of the steam chamber...almost scalding my hand. They apparently want to charge a fortune to fix this problem...I can easily replace it with a different brand. I have had similar problems with Rowenta irons...dripping and spitting, steam not adjustable, etc. even when you use bottled spring water (recommended by them) and clean the items on a regular basis."
5,Well Designed,"If you're looking for a serious iron, here it is. Plenty of continuous steam and easy to re-fill with tap water. No filtering required. No spitting of dirty water onto clothes. Great docking feature too.WELL WORTH THE MONEY!"
1,Do not waste your time with this iron.,First the good news: When this iron works it is great. Now the bad news: The iron rarely works. I received this iron ten months ago and have had it in three times for repairs a month at a time. The steam stops working all of the time and they keep sending back the same lemon iron to me. For all of the money that I have paid for this it's costing me more than $1 per garment for ironing! My $9 Sunbeam from the drug store works better than this iron ... at least it turns on! Rowenta says that they will give me no warranty credit for the time that the iron is in the shop. Talk about NOT standing behind your product. What a waste of time this has been.
1,Quit working-no support from Rowenta,"This iron was great for about a year, then it started to spit and leak water. It quit working soon after that. Rowenta just did not care-the warranty was for one year. The iron is too expensive to last just this long."
2,Disappointed But Hopeful,"I purchased this steam generator for a Christmas present for myself - have used it everyday since 1/1/05, and loved it. Thought I had found the perfect iron. Now all of a sudden it has stopped producing steam. No matter how much descalling and rinsing I do to the boiler chamber it will not produce steam. The red light indicating it is out of water has also stopped working. Haven't gotten in touch with Amazon or Rowenta yet as it is the weekend. Read on an earlier review a bad batch was produced so maybe this is one and I can get it replaced - if so - and it works longer than 60 days I think it is a great iron steam generator! If not, Rowenta has gone down the tubes in quality as my last 2 regular irons from them have been awful with a leaking problem."
3,Exceptional product,"I have used this product for a short time and I find it is amazing. The steam generated is exceptional. Ironing is quick and easy. Sewing is my hobby and this product steams new seams and hems with a professional finish, quickly and easily. The upkeep required is a very simple process. Really enjoy this product."
5,Rowenta 980- the ultimate iron,"Hi - I want you to know that this is the absolute best steam iron that one could own. I bought the Rowenta 980 model and when I iron, I put the iron on one spot once and it is ironed.No need to go back and forth. Need a crease out? Press the steam button and presto...no crease or a new one. I will never go back to a regular iron; it is worth it's price."
5,the best iron in the world,"This is the second steam generator I have purchased from Rowenta. The last one had to be replaced because I dropped it two many times(on a cement floor). I hope I have gotten better and hanging on to things. Because this one is so eazy to use, so quick to get up to max heat and top pressure. It can be used to deliver steam in any position. It is as light as an everyday iron and has a very long cord. I have used steam gererator type irons for 10 plus years now in my home based sewing busines and this is the nicest, easest to use and quite nice to look at too. The water tank comes off to make it easy to take to the sink for refills, instead of (like the old ones)having to bring the water to the unit. All around a great value and a beautiful unit. I hope I can keep my hands on this unit for a long time."
3,not durable,I have had my generator less than one year. Part of the housing unit upon which the water tank sits broke. I sent the unit to the repair center recommeded by the company and was told the repair was not covered by the warranty the cost was greater than sixty dollars. I appealed to Rowenta bcause I knew I had not dropped the generator to no avail. I have used Rowenta products for 20 years and I will never buy another.
5,Romenta DG-980,"The Rowenta DG-980 is fabulous. I am delighted with the results it produces. It's a bit bulky and cumbersome as well as pricey, but it really gets the job done."
4,Steamer,"This steamer is great, except it does not work well trying to steam garments that are hanging. As for steaming on the ironing board, it is great."
5,This is a great whisk!,"I have started to simplify my life and have gone back to basics. Instead of using a machine to blend and mix my batters, I now use a stainless steel mixing bowl and this wonderful whisk. It is very pretty, also, in my favorite pink color."
4,The Change of Life Diet and Cookbook,"I really like the way the book is ""arranged""....by symtoms of menopause and what might work for you. Recipes are really good too...always looking for something different to try!!"
4,great tweezers,"Great tweezers, just what I was looking for. I recommend this sight for anyone looking for precision products.Shipping was without problems"
2,Didn't really care for it.,"I have Chillout 1 2, and 6 and just got this one because I like the others so well. I really didn't care for it. I didn't enjoy most of the song on this disc. Very disappointing."
3,"Just ""okay.""","I did not connect with Chillout 05 nearly as much as I did 02 and 03 (incidentally, I did not connect with 04 as much either). It was okay, but not as spectacular as I was hoping. I looked forward to it all year, and bought it the second it came out, but I have to say that I was a little disappointed in many of the tracks."
3,Chillout is the vibe!!!!,Chillout 05 is a great introduction to the chill music....If you like this kind of music then check out this artist... [...]
2,CANDY COATED OVER PRODUCED,UNFORTUNATLY THE SOUND IS OVERPRODUCED. THE SOUL IS TAMED TO THE MAXIMUM. RAW NO. STRINGS YES.
1,Not bizarre; incomprehensibly rotten!,"Despite the adventurous album cover, this album is complete trash, and I don't know why Allmusic Group gave the previous, more credible 'concept' album a one star, everything they said about it was actually true of 'Bizarre'.They really sound washed up here; very few vocal harmonies or anything, on practically every song there is a drum machine, then there's some rapping, or often just talking, and the occasional, forgettable synth. And that's it!Occasionally there's a hint of backing vocals, but never anything to redeem the album, just makes you wonder where those sweeping strings, sweet vocal harmonies and the joy went?"
1,The product doesn't have what it says,"The product description says it has 20+4 pin main power supply, 12V ATX, 6 peripheral, 1 floppy and 1 SATA. Instead the PSU has 24 pin main power supply (instead of the split 20+4), 3 peripheral, 1 floppy and 2 SATA. Even the picture on the box shows the supply with 20+4 pins but inside the box it is different. This was no good for me because I couldn't even use the main power supply. I guess the product wasn't as advertised.Had to return it. Now I need to look for another PSU!"
3,Great plate - don't order from Amazon,"I ordered 4 dinner plates and 3 of the 4 were broken. I mean not like a crack but in a million pieces. These plates are beautiful and fantastic, but I recommend ordering them from somewhere else. The plates are a 5 and Amazon shipping is a 1. I also ordered the cereal bowls, and 2 of the 4 of those were also broken. These were in a different shipment, too. I had much better luck ordering directly from the Villeroy and Boch site."
2,Beautiful but...,"Very nice looking plates, but they chip very easy. Be careful loading into dishwasher by not hitting other plates while loading, and make sure nothing will beat against them during the cycle.We originally bought a set of 12 (of each size plate). We are now replacing all 12 of the dinner plates. After 10 years everyone of them has at least one chip most have 2 or more."
5,Neil Young Zuma cd,I bought this for myself cause i don't hear it on the radio at all anymore. It sounds great to hear it again.
5,Zuma,"Excellent, mellow, beautiful as only Mr. Young can do. I owned this album years ago. It was stolen when my home was burgled. So happy to have it again. It's worth buying again."
4,A somewhat overlooked gem,"Young and Crazy Horse have done so many fine albums that this one sometimes gets overlooked. Most fans know ""Cortez the Killer,"" but check out ""Barstool Blues"" (wonderfully redone on the live ""Year of the Horse""), ""Don't Cry No Tears"" and ""Pardon My Heart."" The sound alternates between soft and hard. A strong effort that is among the better Young albums."
2,cortez is great,Cortez may be my favorite Neil song but I have had a few of his cd's and this is the one one where I only like one song. After listening to the who 36 minutes a couple of times I only put it on to listen to Cortez.
5,Love it!,"I thought I knew all Neil Young's songs, but I just heard some new ones on this CD, and I love them. I bought this CD just for Cortez the Killer (one of the best guitar solos ever), and I happily received some new great songs along with it. Yay."
5,zuma review,"Very bare bones and honest Neil, maybe too plain for some.He and the Horse in a quiet place.'Cortez The Killer"" stands the test of time, and ""Pardon My Heart"" tears at your own.I've liked this album since I owned it on vinyl decades ago, and screw the purists who decry digital sanitation."
4,WHERE ARE THE 70S ALBUMS?,"This is one of the best of his efforts from the latter half of the Seventies. ""Cortez the Killer"" and ""Barstool Blues"" are two of his best songs of that period, and there is plenty more to recommend the album, like the CSNY track ""Through My Sails"". But it makes one wonder why Reprise chose to release this on CD while holding back the others of this period--TIME FADES AWAY, ON THE BEACH, and AMERICAN STARS & BARS survive only as scratchy vinyl relics. If LANDING ON WATER can make it to CD, then why not these?"
5,get all neil from the seventies,"zuma is another masterpiece from neil and crazy horse. in fact all of neil young's stuff from the seventies is awesome. zuma is a little more of a rocker than on the beach or tonight's the night with guitar tracks like dangerbird and cortez the killer, then throw in a few acoustic ballads and you got perfection. i got zuma last in my neil seventies vinyl collection and was not disappointed, in fact i listen to zuma more than all the others. on a saturday morning, listen to everybody knows this nowhere, harvest, after the goldrush, times fades away, on a beach, tonight's the night, then zuma, and don't forget comes a time from 1978, now your listening to neil's best stuff."
4,better the most,Being a Neil Young fan and looking back Zuma is one of his better albums much of his stuff does not wear well long simplistic guitar solos or pathetic whiny crying (i like some of it still) looking back his albums are spotty containing great songs I just purchased TRANS trying to recapture the magic on CD . A couple of great songs with filler . same old same old FREEDOM CD (another so called comeback i believed it) the same way . RUST NEVER SLEEPS another one trick pony . In some ways i guess Zuma is his last good album.
5,One of his best,How can anyone who knows likes Neil Young not think this is one of his best albums? Cortez the Killer is a classic. Stupid Girl a classic. Through My Sails a classic. Wait. Virtually every song here is a classic. Highly recommended!
1,Bad Movie All Around!,This movie never should have been made it's an embarassment to a great actor and the actress was absolutely horrible. I wouldn't give this movie to an enemy.
4,Ignore Joshua's review above,"If you look at all of Joshua's book reviews above ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G2N8MSG1W50Q/ref=cm_cr_auth/002-0062097-2436865?%5Fencoding=UTF8 ) you'll see that he's entered the same exact critique for two different William Lyne books. It's obvious that someone wouldn't write the same exact critique for two different books if he actually had read both.I would suggest that when the only negative comment for an author is from someone who's been proven NOT to have honestly given that critique then this particular criticism should be ignored.If you are interested in this particular subject the book ""Man-made UFOs: 50 Years of Suppression"" is a tremendously well-documented and scientific approach to researching this topic."
4,One of the most important books written on UFOs.,"Bill Lyne's book and Gregory Kanon's The Great UFO Hoax, together, I believe, show the solution to the true nature of UFOs."
1,"The truth from Communist viewpoints, that is","Well, I didn't know that Fidel was a big fan of open expression opinions and truth, but his admirers seem to think so and have collected some of his speeches and some of Che Guevara's into this collection. It reads like most books on Cuba, total polemic. While some works claim Castro is Satan and Cuba is heck on Earth, this one takes the other irrational side in this silly debate - namely America is Satan and Castro is the savior of the world's working people. You won't find balance here and you won't even remain interested throughout. I at least expected Fidel to be interesting rather than dull. Oh well. C'est la vie."
4,What's up with the vocal tracks?,"I would have given it a 5 except I'm aggravated and baffled by the fact that it is a movie originally filmed in Chinese, yet they were too lazy to LEAVE IN the original chinese audio track! They already include English subtitles too! How hard is it to leave in the default audio and use the subtitles already provided? I mean, they bothered to put a french dub on there, for pete's sake!And this is on the DVD! They have plenty of room.That's just stupid. Instead they include more film trailers than I've ever seen. What a waste. I didn't pay for film previews.Still, at least the dubbing isn't bad."
2,OMFG Dubs ONLY!,"This movie is one of the few I showcase to friends when they talk about how much they love Jackie Chan. I often follow that statement up with, ""Well, have you seen this.."" I do love this movie and for every Jackie Chan fan, its one of the movies you need to watch. When my VHS version 'died', I got a copy of this version to find... f***in A, they dubbed it, and dubbed it horribly I might add. I really don't understand why you would want to lobotomize a film like this, or any film for that matter with D-list vocal talent... So my rating is for this dvd release of Drunken Master II, a 5 star movie otherwise destroyed by the stupid dubs. And though that won't matter to most of you, for some it will mean enough to keep many from even thinking about purchasing this release, and that is who this review is for."
1,Executives must have been drunk to release this lame DVD,"Drunken Master 2 is one of the greatest martial arts films ever, especially given that most of its amazing highlights were done without any special effects, only the determination and skill of Jackie Chan and crew. The Legend of the Drunken Master dvd release represents an edited (slight but for any film purist significant enough) version of the film and most of all features NO original dialogue track, only the typically awful English dub. Hold out, and hopefully someday someone will have enough respect for both the film and target audience to put out a DVD worthy of this movie. For now, avoid Legend of the Drunken Master and find/make a friend who owns a subtitled vhs or laserdisc copy of Drunken Master 2."
3,If it wasn't for the dubbing...,"I'm not a huge Jackie Chan fan, but Drunken Master II is one of my favorite Hong Kong movies of all time. The end battle alone is worth the price of admission, Johnny Lo is a great villain, and Andy Lau's cameo at the beginning of the movie is hilarious. Unfortunately, the American release of this film has some of the worst dubbing and translation I've ever seen; the bad voice acting and incoherent writing nearly ruin the film. If you can't find the original, Chinese-language release of this (and I know it is on VHS in America), this DVD is sufficient, but it's nowhere near as entertaining as it would be with the original voices and subtitles. Too bad...this could have been one of the must-buys of the year."
5,The Legend of Drunken Master,"Jackie Chan stars as Wong Fei Hong , and this movie has action and adventure at the same time.The story is about a young man named Wong Fei Hong tring to save China's history from an evil abassador.When Fei hong was on the train tring to get the gin-seng,he wounds up with a special artifact,and the bad guys found out and chases him around.That is When the action and adventurecomes. At the end , he uses drunken boxing to defeat the evil ambassador...it is a very good movie."
5,Best actions scenes of his career!,"Don't get this movie wrong because it's one of his older ones, because I know I did. I first saw it at home on a movie channel, passively, but it quickly got my attention, especially at the superbly choreographed fight scenes. There were plenty of them, and whilst I won't spoil it, the very last fight scene(s) were so thoroughly thought out with such creativity that I saw this is a *must* buy for any action and/or martial arts fan!"
5,buy this movie now!!!!,this is my favorite jackie chan movie. any fan should own this. excellent action and story. buy this movie now!!!!
2,This is as good as it'll get,"For those of us who aren't completely tech-savy, I suggest getting yourself this VHS release of ""Drunken Master 2."" Buy yourself a VHS to DVD recorder, and then record it onto a DVD-R or DVD+R. Unless you know how to do it with a laser disc, this release is as good as this movie gets. The picture quality will be pretty bad with burnt Chinese/English subtitles.Hopefully within our lifetime we will see a remastered release with excellent picture quality, audio quality (in its original language)."
5,Drunken Master 2,I have been looking for this DVD for a long time. With Amazon its like a dream come true that I will get it.
4,I'm not an alcoholic. I'm a boxer.,"I'd love to hear that excuse. In this fantasy world, getting wasted makes you a better fighter. I don't like this 'sequel' as much as the awesome Chan classic 'Drunken Master' from the 70s, which is my favorite of all Chan films, but what great fun. One of the few Chan films available on DVD in anamorphic widescreen."
4,Fast Paced Kung Fu Action,"If ever there were a movie to take me back the the days of Kung Fu mania, continous play triple features at budget theatres during the 70's, its LEGEND of DRUNKEN MASTER. And best of all, this movie actually has a plot!Trying to stop British (a throw back to the days of British ownership of Hong Kong?)smugglers and poor factory conditions of his friends, Jackie Chan's recreation of Wong Fei Hung has fast paced, exciting kung fu featuring some of the most ecxiting, intense fighting sequences ever filmed (in the restaurant and steel mill scenes). Although peppered with the usual out of sync dubbing made famous by these imports, the voice of Hung is the actual voice of Chan!Originally released in 1994, this sequel to 1978's DRUNKEN MASTER is a must see by all Jackie Chan fans."
5,awesome martials arts movie,"This is a great movie for those who love well choreographed martials arts scenes that does not look artificial. No super human flying in this one, just realistic stunts. I normally watch Jet Li more than Jackie but I really like this one."
3,Why break something that doesn't need fixing?,"Drunken Master II is a lot of fun, and showcases Chan teaming up with one of the Shaw Brothers' finest filmakers.Shame someone saw fit to give it a lousey re-dub and drop what was a very engaging original score.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has proven that there is much more than a marginal market for Hong Kong cinema in it's original form - so how about a release for the REAL cut of Drunken Master II, instead of this altered version?"
4,Absolut Jackie Chan,"I've loved Chan's humorous and carefree exhibition of martial arts, even in movies where everthing else suffered. It's a rare gift to garner laughs during fight scenes. In this move, Chan is at his best, using a fighting style that highlights the humor of his art. The stunts and choreography are amazing. Even if it is dubbed and censored, this movie is not to be missed if you enjoy Chan's antics. Once you've finished chuckling, though, consider the issues raised by the movie. Cultural appropriation did not die when the Chinese kicked the British out. It continues now in more subtle forms than ex-missionaries decorating their rooms with the cultural treasures of those they evangelicized. Consider the New Age appropriation of Native American rites, songs, and sacred objects. Look at the commercialization of Anarchism by Earthlink and the Gap. (If you'd like to discuss this review, please drop me an email by clicking on the ""about me"" link above. Thanks!)"
3,better than average!,"I have to agree with Kelly M ( see posts above ). This movie is not all that. Don't get me wrong, I love Jackie Chan flicks, but once you see what Jet Li is capable of, you won't turn back. Fist of Legend is AMAZING! This has got to be the ultimate martial arts movie ever made. If you need proof go watch it for yourself."
4,"Fun, Light Comedy","I'm not a fan of Chan, but boy can Jackie Move! Jackie stars as: Wong Fei Hung the son of a respected Chinese herbalist/doctor.Wong Fei, in an effort to save his father some paying taxes on his imported herbal medicines, Wong Fei, puts an expensive parcel in the baggage of a Chinese Official. Later, when he goes to retrieve it, he inadvertently steals an ancient Chinese relic, embroiling Wong Fei, and his wacky family, in a ton of trouble. (It was a stretch to believe Jackie was a YOUNG man, but the plot was amusing and funny, that this discrepancy could be overlooked).Chan's moves, and facial expressions were great as the inebriated Wong. His parents were amusing and well portrayed. I admit I had no clue who the minor characters were- (this must've been covered in the first film which I missed), however this didn't really matter so much.... Overall, an amusing movie. Great Martial Arts action! sure to be enjoyed by fans!"
2,I am heatbroken!,"I was extremely sorrowful to watch the legend of drunken master. One of the best Jackie Chan's movies was ruined brutally. The dubbing betrayed the original meaning and made it so ridiculous. The stepmother in the original movie is a hilarious but righteous and kindhearted woman, but she became annoying after the damn dubbing. Some parts of the movie are robbed away from the original movie. The worst thing that I can't tolerate is that they changed the musical score during the fightings. It makes the movie like meaningless mortal combat.I love the original drunken master II, and I want to kick the butt of whoever came out with this damn ""The legend of drunken master""."
1,Stay away from the Disney DVD,"I won't say anything about the movie itself ... just advise people to stay away from this Disney-released DVD (unfortunately they acquired worldwide rights for distribution). Dubbing is extremely poor to the point of being an offense to the buyer. Needless to say, the original (cantonese) audio is not included. The movie's original score has been replaced by a completely new one as well. The hilarious last scene of the movie has been cut completely. Other than that, the transfer is nice (better than other DVD releases) and yes, this DVD is uncropped & anamorphic."
5,Jackie's Best Film Ever,"Simply put, Drunken Master II is Jackie's best film ever. If you have enjoyed any, I repeat any, of Jackie's movies, you should buy this immediately. It is more in the vein of his older style (more technical fights, fewer stunts, but some great stunts nonetheless), but can still be enjoyed by anyone. If only this would come out on DVD..."
2,You have to be drunk to like it,"This moive will be a disapointment to most Jakie Chain fans in North America, the dubbing is even worse then most of his moives and the action just dose not make up for it. The begaining is painfully slow with some sentences that will make one eyebrow go up and make you wonder what they are trying to say. True thier are some half decent fighting sceans in this movie but not enough to keep you're hand off the fast forward botten. This is a rentail unless you are a hard core Jakie Chain fan and most have all of his moives."
3,Would Someone Please Kickbox His Stepmother?,"YES, Jackie Chan movies are fun, and YES, this movie has the best fight sequences I've ever seen; but won't SOMEONE agree with me that his stepmother's role was the most annoying thing they've ever endured? I can't help but feel that there's something RACIST in the way westerners are falling all over themselves to give this film 5 stars, like, ""isn't it cute the way those Hong Kong actors really can't act, and isn't it kind of sweet that they don't bother with an interesting or plausible script?"" I've heard reviewers compare Jackie Chan films to those of Fred Astaire, and I agree, you watch them for the fight/dance sequences and merely endure the story in-between. Well, that's fine, but if you can put those great fight sequences in a better movie, well, you'd have a better movie."
2,"Subtitles, please!","This film was a major disappointment to me. First of all, even if this is a martial arts film, it should have subtitles. Dubbing in any movie (except maybe something on the level of Godzilla) is unacceptable. Secondly, Anita Mui, who plays Chan's stepmother, is annoying beyond distraction. She ruins every scene that she's in with her vaudeville shtick. I love Jackie Chan and he goes to extraordinary personal lengths in this film to deliver an exciting product. However, the great fight scenes aren't enough to overcome the limp humor that plagues this film. Even Jackie lacks the charm that usually infuses the comedy in his movies."
2,find another Jackie Chan flick,"The fight scenes are pretty good, but the dubbing to English is extremely poor. I enjoy Jackie Chan's movies, but I can't see myself watching this one again."
4,A 5-star movie ruined by poor quality transfer,"This is superb Jackie Chan movie that has everything--incredible fight sequences, humor, and great pacing. Chan is simply extraordinary in this, as all of the reviews below indicate. The movie deserves five stars, but the tape I recently purchased has subtitles that could barely be read. A lot of the humor was lost and what little plot there was, also got lost. I highly recommend the movie, and only hope that someone will take the time to make a clean print, prepare readable subtitles, and clean up the sound--a classic movie like this should be seen to its best advantage."
5,Best fight scene in any movie...,"This movie has quite possibly one of the best fight scenes in the history of martial arts movies. The only bad thing about this movie is that it will ruin all other fight scenes for you. Just look for the guy in the tan suit, you'll see..."
3,Just watch it,"This movie has heart. Jackie Chan does his usual un usual stuff, and hits the target.The story is touching and and action packed. A great buy for any one who likes Jackie Chan, and wants to see some of his earlier stuff. Which I think is better any way."
3,A genre film,"Fans of Jackie Chan and the martial arts genre will relish the many fight scenes as well as the comedic performance of this film.The story revolves around a son trying to win his father's approval, the smuggling of Chinese antiquities out of China into England, and the legitimization of a form of martial arts known as ""drunken boxing."" The story is not the frame of the story, but merely a device to hold the action scenes together. The fight in the steel factory and the fight under the train are tour de force.Unless you simply want to watch to fast action and masterful fighting, I would not recommend this film. There is not enough of a plot to really get involved with the film."
4,drunken boxing is cool but scarce here,"drunken boxing refers to a kung fu style in which the user moves as if he were drunk making it difficult for his opponent to guess how he will strike.theres really not very much of it in the movie.jackie chan doesnt fight that well at first but when he gets drunk he starts kicking ass!so,its a play on words.his father beats him for doing it after he forbid him to.then he goes and fights the bad guys to make things right and doesnt use drunken boxing again.kids like jackie.its better than a lot of the more recent chan movies.shanghai noon is better i think.his dad is an ass in this movie.his mother is a liar and very funky.i think there may be an older version or 2 also."
2,Disappointing,"First, let me state that I'm a big martial arts film fan. When my wife got this DVD for my birthday, I was pleasantly surprised. When it was re-released in the US, I never had an opportunity to see it on the big screen, but remembered all the good reviews. I was really looking forward to a good movie, but was very disappointed. Although I realize that Jackie Chan movies are somewhat comical and campy by design, this movie suffers from bad acting (the stepmother is horrible), lame dialogue, ridiculous story line, over-the-top bad guys, etc. Although the fight scenes where well choreographed as you would expect, they are inserted around so much garbage that it cannot salvage this turkey. 2 stars out of 5."
1,orriginal soundtracks on DVD's PLEASE!!,"Fantastic film, but why oh why dont they ALWAYS put the orriginal soundtrack on DVD's :o("
2,So-so,"Ok so I really enjoyed the songs of theirs that I heard on myspace, but when I bought the cd it turns out that those are really the only songs that I like. Most of the other songs just kind of blend in, it's kind of like they used the same formula for every song. Part of that can be blamed on the fact that they use those really high clashing notes in 10 out of the 11 songs if I counted correctly. Guys, those notes sound cool when used in moderation, but seriously, every song? It makes all of the riffs sound the same. The keyboards are cool though, I will admit that. Also, for some reason it bothers me that some of the songs clock in at no longer than 2 minutes, it makes them seem like random parts thrown together rather than songs with actual structure. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure these guys are cool dudes and I know they put on a good live show, I just think that what this cd needed in order to be strong is distinguishable songs rather just a mesh of high notes and open palm muted chords."
4,pretty damn good...,"good cd, i reallly like the keyboard elements in it, sometimes the songs will break down into just the keyboardist playing and some slow singing, but mostly this is good screamo/hardcore. although the music isn't too original (nothing is these days tho) these guys definitely know how to play music and play it right. they're really young too, so they will be around for a while. the reason i only gave it a 4 was b/c the album still has room for growth, its really good but they will get better as time goes on."
4,"Are you for paedocommunion, Dr. Mathison?","With much insight on his historical studies, the mainweakness is the author's somewhat wobbly stance, if youwill, or rather his inclination toward paedocommunion,as you may also find in some of ""Ligonier School"" peoplethese days.On that matter, this book should be read with RobertLetham's *THE LORD'S SUPPER* (Presbyterian &Reformed;,2001)."
1,THIS PRODUCT SUCKS,I bought the 1 gig for my camera... worked GREAT for about a week then in the middle of taking pics it acts weird. Turns out when I turn the cam back on ERROR! Looked up the troubleshoot in my camera manual and it says either Damaged or Dirty! I havent removed the stick so its damaged. Take it back and it is damaged. Get a new one and today (1 week later AGAIN) its broken! I was taking pics and it was acting weird AGAIN! This time Its a format error and I read about in the manual... I do what it says and reformat it and guess what? WONT WORK! Looks like this stick is gonna be returned too. Im so fed up. Im gonna get the SONY one hopefully because sandisk let me down hardcore!!!
3,Boater's necessity,"I ordered this for my sister and after looking at all the reviews, it seems like this is an average kit. If you want to spend a lot more money, you can purchase all your tools separately but since you only use them on occasion ( or not at all), it wouldn't be worth it. Most reviews said that all the kits will eventually rust too. We will see how this holds up. It was shipped in time for CHristmas.The one problem I noted was that all the tools on the top side were out of their holders and fell all over when my sister opened it. It the tools don't stay in place, that is going to be real annoying and will probably make me buy her a waterproof bag for the tools and just throw the case away. The case is rather flimsy."
5,Best one I found for the price.,"This is my third case. I always had different tools in a box and was a real mess. Now I have all in one case and find every tool in it's own place. I have three casesi: One in my boat, one in my home and one in my office. You don't need any other tool to work on those normal jobs around. The best part of this item is the price. I looked around and this was my best option. Just be sure to take a good care cleaning it often, specially if you live near the sea shore, because we all know that the combination of salt and oxigen are equal to corrosion and they don't respect some metals."
2,No movement,"I purchased this lava lamp for my daughter as a Christmas gift, she had been asking for one for months. She was real excited when she unwrapped the lamp. We plugged it in and waited for the lava to start moving. It took 7 hours before the first blob separated from the rest of the lava. It immediately fell back down to the main lava ball and nothing ever separated again. We left it plugged in for 9 hours Christmas day only to see that 1 lava ball rise up. She was extremely disappointed, as was I.I gave this lamp 2 stars for the fact that it looks nice, but that is about it. It is pretty small also (only 13"" in height). Perhaps a larger wattage bulb will make a difference, I will try and find a 25W bulb like others have suggested and then update this review at that time."
2,Murky not Clear,"Problem is, when the product photos are taken, the light is turned off after it is warmed up and working so you don't see the yellow-ish murky fluid instead of the clear. Could be the nature of black/clear lava lamps? Works well but is Ugly."
4,Son loved it :)s,"I got this lava lamp for my 9 year old son. He got it quickly and is very pleased with it. It's not a large lava lamp, but perfect for his small room. We are both pleased with the lamp and the rocket shaped base is really perfect for a young boys room decor. No problems thus far."
3,lamp not hot,i ordered two of these lava lamps the scale was a good size for medium size room but the bulb in the lamp was not hot enough took to long to melt the liquid about 4 hrs before it started even making a slight bit of of movement. contacted company where i bought it told them my concern never heard back. go to walmart they have them if you still ant one save on shipping.
2,"like it, but disappointed","My seven-year-old was SO excited to get the Starship lava lamp. He checked the mail every day for an Amazon package. When it arrived, the bulb did not work. That was a huge disappointment for him that evening. The next day, I visited Wal-Mart for a replacement bulb and they did not carry a 120V 15watt bulb. Another disappointment. We do not live close enough to a major home store (Menards, etc.) for me to check their inventory during the work day, so I put a 25 watt bulb in the lamp (based on a previous review indicating that a 15 watt bulb is not hot enough). The bulb was $4 - I assumed a brand new product that comes with a bulb would come with a working bulb. However, we are enjoying the lamp now.One additional note - the option of black lava in clear liquid appears to be more eggplant (deep purple)."
1,very disappointed,"I bought this for my autistic son's birthday. Well, after 5hrs, the lava was barely burping, not moving. At the 8hr mark, there was no improvement. The lamp is a lot smaller than advertised. We were extremely disappointed. I'm purchasing another to replace this one."
2,"My son likes it, but it's junk","I bought this for my 4 year old son's birthday because he's really into volcanoes, outerspace, science, etc. and I thought this would bring many of those concepts together. I suppose it does and he likes it, but I was really disappointed. First of all, the white and blue don't contrast nearly as well as they do in the picture. The liquid is more cloudy. Second, the whole thing is very flimsy. Don't even consider moving it unless it's completely cooled. The ""base"" was especially annoying to me, as it is totally hollow. I thought it would be solid to offset the weight of the glass lamp/lava part but it isn't, so the whole thing is very top heavy. It wouldn't take much of a bump to knock it over. Also of note, ""13-inch"" refers to the entire thing, top to bottom/base to tip, not just the lamp/lava part so it is rather small."
2,Doesnt work,"Was very excited to receive this lava lamp as a gift for my girlfriend.We got it, and left it plugged in, and the lava doesnt move at all.Waste of 20 dollars."
1,Not as described,"I had to return this item b/c the ""clear liquid"" looked dirty and the black bubbles all settled at the top and could not be seen."
2,Doesn't work well,The bulb never gets hot enough to get the lava moving much. I get maybe one blob an hour making it's way to the top. I do like the space ship design.
3,Very Disappointing!,"I bought this book for my wife who is a native Spanish speaker that learned English by speaking and not from classes, so her English vocablulary is limited. So I thought that this book would have several words she didn't know. Going through the entire book, I was only unfamiliar with less than a handful and we felt that that it did not give anything more than my basic Spanish/English dictionary. Another complaint is that Amazon sells it for $3.99 which along with the shipping makes it cost over $ 6.00 but the book itself is marked $2.00. Also, in many instances a word has more than one meaning but the author was lax in not providing all meanings as a good dictionary would.The good thing about it is that it simplifies culling out of a dictionary for the beginning student, some of the very common words. As I would prefer to have a pocket dictionary with me I think it is an unnecessary expense to have to also add this book."
5,"Like the show Friends , only better!","This show is so funny and so cute that it is better than the show Friends. I am sure that anyone who likes sitcoms about a group would appreciate this show, regardless of being a fan of baseball or not. Check it out; I doubt you will be disappointed. My only caveat is that there are no extras in this box set like the first season."
3,Pales in comparison to Season 1,"After watchingMy Boys: The Complete First Seasonand waiting on pins and needles for months to find out who PJ took to Italy (I don't have cable), I was sadly disappointed to get my collection of Seasons 2 and 3 and find the seasons were much shorter (only 18 episodes total), lacked the warmth of the characters found in Season 1, and no special features. Very disappointing to say the least. Every episode felt rushed and like it was missing the nice bits about Chicago that made it so fun. Not nearly as much about baseball either, which is a big reason I love this show. And it seemed to really lack the spark with the friendship that was so important in the first season. Overall, it was just really disappointing, but I wouldn't say it wasn't worth purchasing. I still enjoyed it, despite the fact that it was nowhere near as good as Season 1."
5,laugh all the time,I love my boys and have wanted the next seasons to come out. It was great getting it at home and not fighting the lines. Thanks
3,For Women,"I don't generally go for books that don't have a crime mystery or conspiracy theory, or something edge of your seat. But this was a good read and a nice change of pace. And it was easy to relate to for me, even though I'm not really a ""girly girl"" that goes for ""chick books."" Her book, Eye Contact, was more my speed and I absolutely LOVED it, which is why I bought this one. Even though this was less my style, Cammie McGovern is a wonderful author and it was still a worthwhile read."
3,A lot of pretty imagery but...,"I have to say that I was not as impressed with this debut as some of the other reviewers. While it had a fascinating premise, and did keep me turning pages, I was ultimately left unsatisfied. There's nothing to indicate why these two women are so repressed and essentially emotionally [messed] up. The sibling issues are nicely treated, but all in all I felt it was very hard to make a connection with these people. The New York Times Book Review comments that it feels like you're looking at this world through the wrong end of a set of binoculars; I completely agree.From a strictly mechanical viewpoint, I also had problems with the author switching between first and third person as she alternates between the sisters' perspectives, finding it cumbersome and detractive to the story itself. Because McGovern is a skilled writer, I have to figure that this was done for a purpose. I just didn't get it."
5,Extraordinary,"Spent a late summer afternoon completely enchanted by this remarkable novel! The writing is poetic, so beautiful. . . Cammie McGovern is an extraordinarily talented writer. What is so remarkable is that this was her first novel! The story of these two sisters is told with great insight, the dialogue at times heart wrenching, and other times humorous. It all rings true. I will most definitely share this wonderful book with my sisters! Looking foward to more from Cammie!"
5,Part one Rocked it,"I only just finished the first part of the series (was at origins game fair and did not watch it until i got back). The girls are training and preparing for the next round of the tournament, as they prepare to fight in one on one battles the queen prepares her own plans in order to keep her crown. New fighters and darks plots abound as the field gets whittled down to the final matches, and the queen works to turn friend against friend, starting with a certain Bandit of the Wilds.The story just gets better, the action is amazing and the characters just do not stop entertaining. While the usual fan service and the body flashes and unusual names are still part of the series (come on when the head of the church has the name of Milfina you just have to wonder where the writers come up with them), they do not take anything away from the story. The story is reaching the final stretch and I am looking forward to the final fights.Later"
2,=_=,"...the story line only exists so that the anime can continue....this is just plain and simply a cartoon made so it can show tittiesit has provocative talk, whorelike and innocent characters....the whole thing is basically just for teen age boys. that is the only people I can see buying this when they know what it is...if it was any more obsene it would be a straight up hentaiand it is VERY questionable...the queen looks like shes twelve and the only thing she wears below the waist looks like some sort of barbed strap on....not really worth the buy unless your into that sort of thing....."
4,Wooden staffs do NOT sound like swords!!!,"The overall show is great. The concept behind it is good. The characters are the same old type you see if most anime. I pre-ordered this & part 2. Part 1 came same day it was released. Packaging was perfect fit. Only down side I see about the show itself, is that some of the sound effects don't match up. By that, I mean how do two WOODEN staffs make sparks when they collide & sound like swords colliding? Other than that, its pretty funny & there's plenty of action & loads of fan-service. Plenty of nudity so definitely NOT for under 17. But that's my opinion."
5,An Excellent prayers for the teens of Spirit filled mothers,"If you are a Spirit filled Christian concerned about a teen, this book is a God send. It covers the themes we are concerned about such as: their spiritual life, sexuality, character, relationships, education, careers, and maturity. There are 136 prayers each back by a list a scriptures relating to the prayer. As a fund raising project I have sold over 42 of these books. A number of people have brought multiple copies,often as gifts to friends and family. I highly recommend this book"
3,Every day I pray for my teenager,I was disappointed that the book I received did not have the same cover as pictured. I received an older version of the book which is not the updated one that is pictured. This made me feel that I did not get the full benefit of what I thought I had ordered and paid for.
3,"Poor time synchronization, heavy","I ordered this one for $75 a month ago.Really BAD reception (tested on dozens of places in NY). For the whole months it sync'ed only once, the very first night. It's 1 hour back now.Well, I ordered another one for $75 - the second's arm was not on its place (!), and NEVER EVER it gets sync'ed...Now it's $70. Should I order the third one to try? ..."
5,A Bear in Paris,"Grigory Sokolov is a Russian Bear, a recluse who seldom records but plays the piano like a demon. This two hour concert in Paris is a unique opportunity to see and hear him.I have the entire set of Beethoven piano sonatas with Daniel Barenboim. Sokolov plays three of them on this DVD. I can guarantee you that there is no chance of sleeping through any of them. He also plays six dances by Komitas Vardapet. VardaWHO? Apparently he is very big in Armenia.For me the highlight of the concert was Prokofiev's Sonata no. 7. I have been listening to him since Peter and the Wolf as a child. The music for the ballet Romeo and Juliet clinched it for me. Prokofiev is a modern composer who uses extended chords like Charlie Parker did. Sokolov got a standing ovation for this work. With four encores the concert totals 123 minutes of widescreen HD entertainment."
5,Excellent product !,I bought this hub because in our office we couldnt print while we are connected to the VPN. Since the printer wasnt on the same network anymore.This Hub solved our problem. 4 users are able to connect via USB and print with no problems while connected to the VPN.The only problem I would say is that we have to manually switch and control who gets to print. Basically only one user at a time could be connected to the printer and you can control that through a software included with the Hub.But otherwise......a Quality product !
2,not edition advertised,The book did not come in the binding that was advertised. The condition was god but not like new. I thought about returning it but it would be difficult to find the edition advertised. Im keeping it but its not what was advertised by a long shot
5,Another great collection,"More inspiring fantastic photographs to look at. This collection is as good as it gets. Covering advertising photography, abstract, portraits, people, architecture, everything.If you love photography, a student, professional or just a fan, you have to see this.Enjoy"
2,"If you're not Catholic, may be worth getting","This book was not as helpful as I'd hoped. At least half of the questions are answered ""it depends...check with your local parish"". May be informative for non-Catholics but contains a lot of information most Catholics already know."
5,wonderful documentary,"this movie gives a gilmpse at the heroism and courage that these people portrayed in the film showed.not for a moment,or an hour,but for years.these families truly loved these children, and their humanity is quite stark against the actions or inactions of many of their countrymen."
5,Ellsburg books. Passport for Jennifer,"It took a while to find one, but I'm glad I did. I have read most of Ellsberg's books and this is another good one."
4,Great gift..,"I got this for my father-in-law when I noticed his smaller version was about done with all the daily wear and tear. I was still at home so I had an opportunity to see it when it came in. The organizer is exactly how it's pictured. The leather is good quality and all the extras like the calculator and appointment schedule were solid, not flimsy or cheap at all. My father-in-law loves it and he's had it now for two years. So I would recommend this to others who are looking for a small enough organizer that has a little of everything to make day to day activities less stressful and more organized."
3,Piano music from Pride and Prejudice,"It was a little disappointing, but I was prepared as I read reviews that its not really for advanced pianists."
3,Freelancing,"This book contains a lot of valuable information and as the author is a former magazine editor it is useful to get a point of view from the other side of the fence. However, there is also a lot of useless information and I would say that The Renegade Writer is a more useful book to anyone new to freelancing. Overall though, worth buying."
2,Poor Quality,"The VHS tape was ok, but the content of the material was disappointing and the performances were not full content but cut off in the middle."
5,A terrific story,"I was eager to read this book because there are hints about the Brasillach case in Kaplan's memoir, *French Lessons*. *The Collaborator* doesn't disappoint. It combines historical research with the drive of a legal thriller. And it raises interesting moral questions about the accountability of writers to society. I highly recommend it."
4,Kodak i40 Win 7 64 bit,They have a Twain Windows 64 bit driver that works well with Paperport 14 and Windows 7. I have been using this on a 32 bit system for several years. Works will for documents. Need to pair with a flatbed for photos and books.Kodak i 40 - sheetfed scanner 888-2649 )
4,Here's to the winners,"The question is: back from where? The answer is: retirement. Yes, Frank Sinatra retired in 1970. It didn't last long, though. This ""comeback"" album was released in 1973. After that, Sinatra pretty much stayed unretired until he died 25 years later. This album, while not his best, has some good performances on it. I especially like the four songs written by Joe Raposo (Sesame Street composer). Recommended to Sinatra's fans."
3,Soft rock and the Chairman: just okay,"Everyone loves a comeback, and this album represented Sinatra's return to the studio after a brief first 'retirement'. There are some nice performances here, including the first track and especially 'Send in the Clowns' and 'There Used to be a Ballpark', the latter with some interesting lyrics. Some of this album is awful -- the Kris Kristofferson number notably. 'Noah' is also just wrong for Sinatra, suffering from the same overproduction as much early 1970s music. 'Dream Away' is just hokey.On the strength of Sondheim's 'Clowns', this album is listenable, but there are many more cherishable Sinatra albums that I would recommend before this one. In the post-retirement period, The Main Event Live is a great album, for example."
3,Missing Tracks,"I have the original LP for this record and I have fond memories of listening to it, however I am perplexed as to why the track Cycles, has been left off the CD issue of this LP. This is surprising as in many ways it is one of the best tracks on the original LP.Because of this I am very relunctant to purchase this CD and this is reflected in my overall rating of the CD. I think I will stay with my original vinyle LP and perphaps burn my own CD"
5,Vitas ~ Need I Say More?,"Yeah, Ditto, what the four above me said :)I couldn't have said it better myself!"
4,"F Troop, A Great comedy",This show is a great comedy! A fun wacky show as in Gilligan's Island and for the whole family! Love the Mountie episode and Our Brave in F troop. Can't wait to watch the rest!!!
5,"F Troop, 2nd season of laughs",This was a childhood favorite and never fails to please. The interplay between characters who expertly stay in character shows great acting skills.
4,F Troop: Season Two,"I purchased both seasons of this show. It is a very funny show and I recommend that people purchase it. It is too bad that the series didn't continue past the second season. Ken Berry is very good, as well as the other actors. I was happy that the second season was in color. If you just want to sit down and watch an old fashioned funny show this is the one for you. It is right up there with Gilligan's Island and I Love Lucy. Pure enjoyment."
4,Funny Show,"I waited for this shows price to be lowered before buying it. I purchased seasons one and two. It's funny and entertaining. Agon's my favorite character. Vincent Price, Don Rickles, were a few of the guest who appeared on the show. There's the clumpsy Captain, played by Ken Berry, who is helpless without his troops assisting him at times. The Sarge and Corporal Agon pretty much run the camp. The dealings with their Indian partners are funny to watch too. I don't remember the person's name who played the Chief, but he is hilarious. It's clean fun, which is almost non-existence these days."
5,That dont make comedys like this anymore,"Very happy with this purchase, Vincent Price , and other great guest stars. A Get Smart spoof , Mini-skirted indian girls , great stuff."
4,More fun with the brave men of Fort Courage,"The screwball comedy F Troop may never be considered a great classic, but it is great fun. Ken Berry is the bumbling captian incharge of Fort Courage Kansas. He and his band of idiots and misfits are all that stand between Kansas and the indians. But luckyfor Kansas the indians are almost as dumb and cowardly as the boys in blue.It`s great fun for all ages."
5,F Troop- The Complete Second Season,"I purchased this video for a Christmas present. I haven't watched the video yet but I was very satisfied with the service fromAmazon. I order from this site occasionally and am pleased that my items are received in a timely manner and the packages are in good shape when they arrive.Thank You,Victoria F. Murton"
5,Practical and Effective Book on Improving Sleep,"The title is a tad misleading. It suggests lightweight content. The book is indeed concise and easy-to-follow, but it also solidly professional and rigorous. Of the three books on improving sleep that I read when I was experiencing sleep problems this past winter, All I Want Is A Good Night's Sleep helped me the most. It provides two effective strategies for incrementally improving one's sleep, one night at a time."
4,they work,"works well, floor must be very clean and if you get the feet dirty they must be cleaned as well or on a hardwood floor they will slide around."
3,worked good for a month,"well, we were putting them on chairs with metal bases, so screwing them on wasn't an option. We've had them about 2 months - after about a month, they started falling off; and the chairs weren't even used all that much. twice a day at meals. That kinda sucks. Come to think of it, I guess we can try some crazy glue, but i wouldn't think I'd need to - they should have stayed on... Otherwise they worked as advertised while on the chair."
2,Wouldn't Stay Put,"These worked great...when they stayed attached to the bottom of my chair. But, after a few days of pushing and pulling my chair up to my desk, they popped off. The adhesive used just isn't enough to hold these guys onto anything that's going to be moved around fairly frequently and with any weight on it (i.e. a desk chair).This is a problem with pretty much any product you buy, and these are no exception. I'll keep hunting around for other options so I don't scrape up my floor."
3,Trouble keeping them on chairs,We are using there on 2 recliners and a couch. For the couch they are working great because we were able to screw them down. For the chairs we stuck them to the metal bottom with the supplied double sided tape and it will not stay on. With all of the traction with the floor the joint with the chair keeps failing. These work well with preventing items from sliding but works better with larger furniture or things that are not used frequently.
5,My son is really in to scooby doo.,He likes to see which character is on his fruit snack. Betty Crocker Fruit snacks are among the best.
5,Great for small cameras,This case works great for my Fujifilm Finepix J10.Pros:Small - doesn't fit in my pocket but isn't massiveHard - the case isn't just cloth. It is slightly harder to help protect the camera betterConnections - attaches very nicely to my camelbak for easy access when hikingRoom - can fit an extra memory card and MAYBE an extra battery with the cameraThere aren't many cons as I see it. I'm not a pro and just need something well made but cheap that will hold/protect my camera somewhere that's easy to access while hiking. This fits the bill. It won't fit a camera much bigger than the Finepix J10 I think.
5,Great quality boots!,I purchased these from Amazon and I love them! They are comfortable durable and the great Ariat quality I expect this is my fourth pair of Ariat's that I have purchased in the last 2 plus years I still have all 4 and I wouldn't buy another brand you truly get what you pay for with these a great quality durable comfortable boot that will last!How many thing's can you say that about anymore.
1,VERY POORLY MADE AND DESIGNED,"THIS CONTROLLER IS THE WORST THING THAT I HAVE OWNED EVER SINCE I GOT MY XBOX. I USED TO USE IT FOR A 2ND PLAYER CONTROLLER, AND NOW I CAN'T EVEN DO THAT. THIS THING IS TOTAL JUNK!!! WHEN I GOT IT OUT OF THE PACKAGE, I THOUGHT IT LOOKED TOTALLY COOL, BUT IT REALLY WAS A SCEME TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY WERE BUYING A QUALITY ITEM, WHEN ALL THEY WERE BUYING WAS A CONTROLLER THAT DIDN'T WORK RIGHT. I PLUGGED IT INTO MY XBOX. IT DIDN'T WORK. IT LIT UP, BUT IT WOULDN'T WORK CORRECTLY. ALL IT DID WAS SCROLL THROUGH OPTIONS, AND NOT WORK WHEN PRESSED. I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS PROCUCT AS IT IS TOTAL CRAP!!!"
3,A good sampler,"This release is like a box of chocolates, lots of examples from an artist who is constantly pushing his own envelope. I'm not a huge fan, but in a rustic, rudimentary way, Shakey Deal (aka Neil Young) makes his music, HIS MUSIC. I like uniqueness in artistry and Mr. Young is definitely an original."
3,No Horse With No Name,"A fair collection of reasonable songs, however I would have preferred if they had included what I think is his best song, ""Horse With No Name"" and maybe also Keep Rocking in The Free World and Harvest Moon. On the whole its ok though and you do get a lot of songs for the money."
1,Wouldn't know,"After making me wait nearly two months (TWO MONTHS!!) for this CD, Zoverstocks informed me that it could not deliver it!"
1,needs to be remastered (content 5 stars),"As much as I love the stuff on this two cd set before I buy it , it needs to be remastered. Why has this set or even after the gold rush or Neil Young, his self titled solo, not yet been remastered?"
2,"The worst fidelity in my collection of 2,000+ CDs","The music would be a fine introduction to early Neil Young, but the fidelity sounds like an old car radio playing through your friend Larry's coat. Every track that is available elsewhere sounds better elsewhere. (Compare ""Like a Hurricane"" on this album to the one on ""American Stars n Bars,"" which is HDCD in standard release.) If you simply must have some of the oddball cuts it doesn't look like you have much choice. Actually, the smart thing to do would be to wait until Young's back catalogue gets the audiophile treatment."
4,Decade Review,"There are songs on this album that I don't have on any of the many Neil Young albums I have. This was the greatest decade of Neil's career. I love every single album and song he came out with at that time. Even Time Fades Away, which Neil himself doesn't like."
3,A Brilliant Musician...,"but not exactly what I was expecting. I get a mixed feel when listening to this album. Some of the songs are vivid and excited while the slower and deeper songs are quiet and hard to hear. I'm not saying the songs are bad, but I agree with the poor sound quality comment. Neil Young has a huge blend of musical styles that are portrayed pretty well on this album, but I spend too much time turning up the volume in order to hear them all and then turning the volume down because the following song is so much louder. I would like to find a best of album that has a better digital recording, but until then, this one does the job."
2,"As an album it's five stars, as a CD it's 1 star","Decade is the best summation of Neil's career by default. With no word on when Neil's massive ""Archives"" sets are going to be available, if ever, and with Lucky Thirteen being the only other compilation available of any part of Neil's career, it doesn't have much competition.Each song was well-chosen, but the triple LP had much better sound and packaging than the CD does--indeed, Neil's work deserves an overhaul. Furthermore, although Young's liner notes are always interesting, there isn't much of a context for new fans to latch onto.Hopefully one day Neil Young will finish compiling his ""Archive"" sets and make them available to the public, at which time ""Decade"" will probably be redundant anyway. However, until then, ""Decade"" will be the best introduction to Neil's music."
5,required listening. period.,"this is it. this is the best. it doesn't get any better than this (unless neil finally puts out that decade II collection he's been talking about for the last 10 years). this is a must-have for any record collection. this one has it all, from soft acoustic ballads to rock 'n' roll at it's loudest. if you want an answer to the question ""why is neil young idolized by so many musicians?"" then look no further than decade."
5,great value!,"Nice, small, (5oz.) plastic cup. Heavier duty plastic than I expected. They are easy for small children to hold. They are holding up well to our day care setting."
3,Not for people with Candida!,"I'm not sure why this book is touted as a reference for people candida. It has recipes calling for the use of potato, milk, fruit, and more. THESE ARE ALL NOT OK for someone trying to kick a candida infection. Is it a healthy book? sure, but it is not a book that deprives yeast from is main food source....SUGAR and carbs."
2,Yeast Feast,"Feast without yeast was very different from most books that deal with the yeast syndrome. What worked for this author is not typical. This author advocates the use of honey. Most books on yeast say that yeast feast on honey. I found very little useful information in this book. It is a quick , easy read. I would not recommend it to people who suffer with yeast problems. I don't think it is for all sufferers of autism. I did not find any recipes that tickled my taste buds!"
3,Good information,If you're looking to read about YEAST... I would recommend this book! It's easy reading and very interesting... As well as informative on short receipes.
1,Should've listened,"I was so excited to receive this book so quickly. And I was just as excited to put it away. I was looking for real MEALS, not a lifestyle change. This book is for those who are already on the path of a a major diet change from mainstream food, NOT FOR BEGINNERS. If you aren't on board with everything the author is saying, the menu items are pretty useless."
1,Feast without Yeast,"Advertised as yeast, sugar, mostly wheat, mostly milk free. The bread & biscuits recipes all include wheat. I was looking for yeast and wheat free recipes, quick breads, muffins. Didn't find any? Milk free recipes include butter. Most of the recipes are for meals that would seldom, if every, have yeast in them. Egg salad recipe is the most bland stupid recipe I've seen. Eggs, salt, celery, and safflower oil, wow. A granola recipe, no yeast obviously, wheat, barley, gluten, yes. I think the author owns an interest in a company that sells expeller-pressed safflower oil and clover honey because its in most recipes. Don't buy this book unless you don't own a cookbook and want to own a poor one."
2,Yeast Free Junk Food... WOW,"Author talks about recipes which are yeast free, and for all those who want to avoid yeast because of candida, can just use a lot of high carb recipes mentioned in this book. Carbs = sugars = candida = more yeast.Then there's french fries recipe, I mean, seriously? Who puts yeast in french fries anyway? And a whole lot of potato recipes, which are starches = sugars = candida = more yeast."
3,3 stars,I aas looking for more information that what the book provided. Perhaps I made my purchase a little too quickly.
2,"Gluten, wheat free - NOT!","I wanted this book for Wheat/Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Yeast Free Bread. Imagine all the recipes for Yeast free bread have Wheat in them and several of the desserts have wheat in the recipe. HELLO! Wheat/Gluten Free means no wheat ingredient should be in the book. I have not tried any of the recipes, I have several Wheat/gluten Free, Dairy Free books and they do not use wheat in their recipes."
4,Feast without Yeast,The book was in excellent condition when I received it. It is very informative and helpful to me at this point.
3,Good For Someone That Knows Something About Candida,"Because if you DON'T know anything about Candida, you would not be able to avoid the pitfalls of the ""avoid"" foods that are mentioned in this book.Proceed with caution and always listen to your own body where this book and its recipes are concerned. Not sure I would recommend it."
1,Can't tell what it is. Runs *extremely* small.,My daughter told me not to get this costume but I thought maybe I could make it work and the price was right. I also liked the medal. My dog is actually 17 lbs and pretty small. I ordered the medium. The medium would be about the right size for a chihuahua. The main problem with the costume however is that the covering is nothing like a lion's mane and there is nothing recognizably lion-like in the structure of the costume.
1,Don't Buy This!,"We ordered one of these power bricks from Smart Parts USA December 15th. I don't know exactly when it came, but within a couple of weeks the plug had developed a crack in the plastic, then two cracks, then it fell apart. I contacted Smart Parts and, upon receipt of my defective unit, they sent a replacement. This past week it developed the very same crack and we know what the end result will be. Smart Parts says my 90 days are up; probably not if you count the days I was without the first one. DON'TBUY one of these units. Apple probably took delivery, found the whole lot defective and sold them off to these guys. Yes, you'll save a few dollars up front if you buy from Smart Parts, but you're going to end up buying one from Apple in the end."
1,defective 65W power adapter for iBook G4/powerBook G4,"this vendor said it was new, but it's obviously used!!! it frequency shuts off, whenever the voltage changes! eg: when i turn on the lights in the room. in order to turn it back on, i have to unplug it and replug it into the wall socket! how annoying!!!"
1,Most terrible apple product,"This is my second adapter and it is going to die soon. Since my first adapter died in one year, I took extreme caution of using the second one. However, it only persists for 2 years. I have to buy a new one again and I am extremely tired of wasting my money on this junk product again."
1,Don't do it!,"Yep read the other posts, I am going to go check out the iGo Juice. Our Apple Extra Portable 65W Power Adapter is total shot. It is now dangerous becuase you have to wiggle it so much in the wall jack to get a connection it is a hazard. And my kids use the imac the most"
1,TOO FRAGILE - I'M ON MY THIRD POWER ADAPTER - VERY ANGRY CUSTOMER,"I love my powerbook G4.. It's lasted me 5 years, no problems EXCEPT for its power adapter. I'm on my third one! I hate that the plug easily slips out and I hate that the plastic on the adapter easily breaks apart. 80 dollars is far too much to have to pay for this for a 3rd freakin time. I wish I could get my money back."
1,Consistently bad quality,"The original adapter that came with our iBook just decided to stop working (no one kicked the cord, or dropped it, or anything like that - it was always plugged into the same outlet under our kitchen desk). So, we bought the replacement. Worked fine for about a month, but then I had to unplug it temporarily the other day to use the outlet for something. In doing so I accidentally dropped the charger about 4 inches onto our wood floor, and killed it. Ridiculously fragile!"
1,Shockingly bad,"THIS ADAPTER IS NOT ONLY DEFECTIVE, IT'S DANGEROUS. We've been through three in less than two years. I love my G4 PowerBook, but this adapter is so fragile that it literally should not be used unless you leave your laptop on a desk and put absolutely no strain whatsoever on the plug. This, of course, entirely defeats the purpose of owning a notebook computer in the first place. Buy an aftermarket adapter if you need to replace the one that came from Apple; you do NOT want this thing to start sparking while it charges your laptop overnight."
1,Almost caused a fire,"I absolutely love Apple, but this adapter is a fire hazard. My cord like so many others got a tear in it(only noticed this break after examining the cord later). I was sitting there writing an e-mail when all of a sudden smoke started coming from where the adapter plugs into the computer. Luckily I was home, and even luckier than that was on my computer when this happened. I would suggest to stop using the adapter that comes with your mac and get an alternative like Macally, because the cord is just too fragile."
3,"Cracked plug-in, but works like a charm","Received the charger, but had a crack around the input to the computer. It's now cracked fully and fallen apart, but still works. Seems a little dangerous though."
5,Exactly what I needed,Nothing special. I got this item very quickly. It worked perfectly. Now I can use my mac... Awesome !
1,Not one of Apple's best,"No denying Apple makes great products, but this is NOT one of them. They spent their money on the visual design and forgot that in order for the item to function it needed to be sturdy. The cord on this WILL break and you will need to buy another. The cord is too thin to withstand anything more than occasional use. Apple should be ashamed of this one and I'm surprised there hasn't been a recall."
5,Great product,I really like this product. Everything worked like it was supposed to. I would recommend it to anyone that needs a replacement.
1,Do not waste your money.,Do not waste your money. This is clearly not an apple product. I am quite disappointed about my purchase. It is a cheap replica.
1,Just Embarassing for Apple,"I love my iBook G4. I have had it for about 5 years and it has been a great computer (though I recently purchased a MacBook out of necessity), BUT the power supply for the iBook is absolutely worthless.I have now purchased two of these power supplies, both with the same ending, a pop, and then nothing. The first time this happened I figured that some substantial traveling and at least moderate use was to blame, but the second one I had for one month and again, pop, nothing. Dead light and now dead computer.As I mentioned before I love Apple products, the OS and majority of the hardware (iPod a different story) has been fantastic, but a power adapter that can't live up to that expectation puts all their products in a bad light.Apple, please, if you are listening, make a power supply that can stand the usage your customer base demands."
1,Money down the drain,"I think this item was to be used for Halloween as the cord lit up and looked like something to be used in a Jack-o-lantern. I do hope to find an adapter that works or I may have to get rid of my ""ancient"" mac."
3,Seems to work alright.,"I purchased this with a little hesitation after reading all the negative reviews. However, it seems to work just fine, with no issue (so far)."
2,Flimsy cord,"Pretty much what everyone else has said. The cord is ridiculously thin and fragile for a laptop. After a year of use, mine is shot (started smoking this morning). The strain relief on this thing is a joke."
1,lasted just one month,"Bought it as a replacement for the original charger, got overheated at one point and died. Does not work after just one month of use."
1,wrong product,"the title says this is a powerbook g3 charger witch it is not. i recently bought this item and it dosent fit my computer at all. i dont understand why it would say powerbook g3 when it clearly is not. this product failed to satisfy my needs as a amazon shopper and apple powerbook g3 user. so, for the above mentioned reasons, i have given this product an unsatisfactory rating of one (1) star and will be reporting this obvious product default to amazon.com."
1,Bulky and (now) broken,"This adapter came with my iBook, and I'll never buy this type again. It has a pitifully short chord: unless you have an outlet right next to every desk, chair, and couch in your house, give up on making it work without an extension cord. When you do get an extension cord, the adapter's bulky base will take up at least 2 outlets, if not 3. The wire covering has come off my cord, leaving half an inch of wire exposed. Because the cord is stiff near the end that plugs into the computer, it easily breaks open, exposing the wire. Try something else, anything else!"
1,DO NOT BUY - Charges only 5 minutes before it stops.,"This adapter is not working. I plug it into my computer, and it will only work for 5 minutes, tops, before it stops. If I would have known this, I would have bought a third party adapter. What a piece of junk. The product description said NEW, but it is NOT a new adapter; by no means. It started smoking and caught fire. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM."
2,Not the item I ordered,"I am waiting for a response from the vendor, because maybe this was a legitimate mistake, but I did not receive an ""original Apple"" power adaptor, as stated in the title. It's a third-party adaptor. It is not the one in the photo and not the same length. Hopefully, the vendor will find the one I actually ordered and mail it to me so I can then return this one and not be without a power cord for even one day."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I have called Apple a couple times and told them that my power adapter fried. I originally bought two. The first popped in a week. The second after about 8 months.It's interesting to see all these negative reviews and then have the AppleCare person tell me that this is not a common problem with other customers. Wow.Dear Apple executive, RECALL THIS ITEM.Make something better!This product is also over priced."
1,Apple got this one wrong,One year and the thin wire got cut. The twin prongs just can't hold the big white block to the socket when plugged into the wall if yanked a bit. Buy 3rd party on this one.
1,The key is the .........key,The lock is solid but where I feel Kryptonite cut corners is the key and inner workings. The key feels like a toy and if you were to put any pressure at all on it it would surely bend/brake. The inner workings of the lock dont give a positive 'click' type response. When you insert the key its a loose 'maybe its working maybe it isn't' type of sensation.

1,"Bottom Of Tha Barrel Cheapie: One of the worst ""movies"" I have had the misfortune to see!","My friend bought GHOSTS OF ANGELA WEBB for $5.00. That's about $5.00 too much. It is one of the worst ""movies"" we have ever seen. everything about it is poor: The script, the acting, the writing,the not so special ""special effects""...EVERYTHING.This is now the ""movie"" we base all other bad movies on!""I saw a really bad movie last night. It was GHOSTS OF ANGELA WEBB bad.""Beare: The guy who directed this has made OTHER poor quality movies (He made a vampire flick that was a little better than ANGELA WEBB...but not by much!)Any movie that you can tell in the first 15 minutes was made at home with a handheld camera should put up a red flag that the movie is going to be a dud.ALSO BEWARE the similar cheepie Horror movie box set VAMPS (another waste of $5.00!)"
1,Inappropriate language for younger teen readers.,"I purchased the first 3 vol. books for my teen reader for Christmas. Upon arrival I opened them and scanned them. The books went right back into the box they arrived in to be returned to Amazon.com. These books were full of inappropriate language! These books were recommended for teen readers, which is way I ordered them. I am glad I checked them myself before giving them as gifts."
5,an interesting biography,"it is an honestly written book that tells of the authors experiences-- her disappointments, her hopes and how she was introduced to falconry. it contains a variation of experiences, and there are more instances not related to falconry than expected."
1,Nothing to recommend it!,"I'm taking the time to offer my opinion of this book, simply to prevent you from making the same mistake I made. This book has nothing to recommend it. A better writer could have spun the same plot into a decent novel, but C N Bean wasn't up to the task. The book is amateurish. I probably couldn't do as well, but I have enough sense read books rather than try to write them. The prose is completely uninspired, and the plot simplistic. Dust to Dust is a real stinker. The real mystery is how this book got 5 positive reviews."
3,Better than his first. . .,". . .but with a totally unsatisfactory ending.The premise: a renegade group of US soldiers are going to stage a biological attack in the US in order to bolster the need for a strong military and bring to the fore the need to protect against terror. The victim: the young daughter of an officer with connections with (but not part of) the conspiracy. Although written in 1998, the plot is extremely timely, in light of the events of the past year.Like his first novel, the criminal investigator involved in the case is a woman with a seriously messed-up private life. Such a convention is rapidly becoming stereotypical, and this might be off-putting to some readers.For this reviewer, however, the book was weakened by an unsatisfactory ending and the use of children as victims, which I find distasteful."
2,"Not the best, by a long shot","The only reason I finished this book was because I had spent $8.99 buying it. I found the style of writing distracting - for example, ""He and she sat down."" Has the author never heard of the word ""they""? There was just one too many spelling mistakes, which only drew attention away from the somewhat muddled storyline. I had too many questions when the book ended - perhaps I wasn't perceptive enough, but who was the FBI leak? Not a bad enough book to be included on your summer holiday reading list, but if your reading time is limited, pass it by."
5,Worth a second read,"I was amazed when I read Dust to Dust. I read it once and found myself rereading. I never do that. If I get confused by a book, I throw it aside. In this case, I reread the entire book a second time. That never happens. This is a great book! Deep with plot twists. Deep with meaning. Separates the seasoned reader from the child."
5,"epic movie, epic bandana, dissapointed with ""commericals""","I was really excited when I got this, The bandana that came with it was also very epicly awesome, and so was the movie. but the only downside of it was that every scene they would re-show old episodes instead of the actual movie. That got really really annoying after a while. Its like ""i've already seen those! why are u re-showing them?"" I would find myself fast fowarding thru those parts...i wanted to see the movie...not old episodes. If i could i could rate it a 4.5 because of that, but everything else was really great! I really liked the movie itself!! Epic is what describes it!!!"
3,Not the best if you already own the series,"I love Hetalia and have the limited edition dvds released by funimation for seasons 1 and 2, which is why I had to have the movie. Unfortunately I was less than dazzled. You still get a fun little bandanna but considering this is the MOVIE its odd there is only one disk. Once you watch the film you understand why, you get maybe 40 minutes or more of new stuff but old skits from the series are inserted throughout. A real let down to those who are familiar with the series and were looking forward to a lot of new material. I don't regret adding it to my collection and this would be a great introduction to beginner fans but the film on a whole is not too great."
3,Classic Hetalia,"This movie certainly is classic Hetalia, however, as you would expect, this movie was trying to give Hetalia a plot which just doesn't match Hetalia's style. It also threw in some strange clips from the series for no reason confusing the movie flow, which worked with the series, but threw off the movie. Over all it was entertaining, but not really worth the time. The series itself is a lot better."
3,Its what I expected.....,"... so I wasn't really disappointed by it. But its Hetalia, so I had to get it. If you've seen Hetalia enough to get it, you'll also get what I mean (at least the first part of what I said). If you're unfamiliar with Hetalia and want a good place to start off, stop reading this and go buy ""Season One: World Buffet""."
2,"The movie is great, but...","I'm a fan of Hetalia and I love the movie. The actual movie.I don't know why Funimation did it, but they decided to stick random episodes from the first 2 seasons into the movie. At times, there are 2 or 3 episodes in a row. Its very jarring and irritating to see everyone working together, more or less, to fight the Pictonians, then all of a sudden we're in the middle of WWII or France is proposing to England or England is learning about Japanese culture from a kappa. One of the worst instances is where Funimation decided to interrupt the build up to the final battle with a random episode.I don't know if Funi felt the movie was too short, but it didn't do the movie or itself any favors. I hope the Japanese studio or manga author complain to Funimation."
3,Paint it white-ish,"I am a huge fan of Hetalia and have watched this movie subed forever ago, the voice acting is good, but does it need to padded with clips from Axis Powers: Hetalia? It is a good movie, but anyone who is watching this movie will have already seen these clips many times, such as Germany going off to fight Russia and Italy freaking out. Or England visiting Japan and hanging out with the Kappa and onion oni. These clips have nothing to do with the Paint it White Story line, and are simply there to pad the movie out. So maybe they are good of you are showing this film to someone who has never seen Hetalia.But that's not to say i disliked it. I know not everyone likes the dub, but i found it good. Not quite as good as it was in Axis powers season two but decent. It earns points for the Doctor Who reference and i almost died at America's line near the end.America: ""I'm happy to see you hands, we are going to have so much fun!"""
5,Must have for Hetalia fans!!,I pre-ordered this at the beginning of September. I was fortunate to attend the premiere at AWA in early October and cannot wait for this movie to show up at my doorstep!It's such a great movie and I want to re-watch it! >_<
5,Epicness,"Hysterical! If History isn't your thing, you may find yourself lovin' every minute of of after this movie~A MUST-HAVE for the Hetalia Fans. The bandanna is super cute too! <3"
4,New book,"This is New so condition is fine. Read is informative; however, I think a bit ""preachy"" in parts of the read. The author is obviously a religion man who relates that your body is a ""God-given"" gift. He has a good deal of knowledge about the body and some of his statements are his perspective/observations. I will see if I become a colon hydro-therapist, whether I agree with his correlations. As a 25 year massage practitioner, there are a few I am questioning as I read. The way he addresses the anatomy psychology is simple and easy to understand. This is always good for those of us in study /learning mode!"
5,great book!,"don't miss out to read this book, it is very well written and gives a lot of helpful information for who wants to improve his or her health and lifestyle."
1,Beware religious overtones of this quack Dr.,"After reading this book one paragraph sticks out about the section on the male testicles. He states that ""wasting"" the male sperm causes senility and overall weakness. He goes on to state thats the reason why we have marriage and adultry laws in the USA. What planet does this moron live? He states he is a doctor but beleives that drivel? I could see if this was written in the 1880's.Book is a total waste."
3,Ok Book,"The book was alright. Not exactly what I was looking for. I thought it was going to explain how to cleanse the colon and keep it taken care of, but itonly mentioned getting colon hydrotherapy and had sections on each part of the body and what it's purpose is."
4,"Great for Entertainment, Fun and Quirky Protagonist","Wow. What a story, and a great plot. It was exciting enough to keep you on your toes, but not so overdone that you were left thinking, ""And she was in high school? Psh."" Lissy is a great protagonist and narrator, and her inner dialogues give good examples of a conscience that every teenager should have. She's great to look up to without being boring.The story seemed to be a bit short, although it may have been because of my recent readings of extremely long books. Or it could have been that I didn't want it to end. It took me only four or five hours to read, but it was amazing. I recommend to anyone who enjoys your humorous High School tale with a twist of supernatural."
4,"Easy reading, thorough, and all in all a great book!","The pictures and illustrations are fantastic. Shows step by step on how to execute beginning moves from crossovers to three turns, and mohawks. Only thing I wish it covered were some basic jumps and spins."
3,No Miracle?,"Reading the review, saw ""all i need is a miracle"" in the songs list.At last, one of my favorite songs in a DVD, and in concert...I'n still looking for the song!The concert?... it's O.K., nothing special.Where is my miracle???"
2,Editorial Misleading- NO MIRACLE HERE,"Only one other person has noted the wrong product description given to Amazon by the manufacturer. Namely, All I Need Is A Miracle is NOT on this DVD. Couple that with another US Top 40 hit, Taken In, and this lowers the rating. It is an average DVD, worth the cheap used price, but a rip-off if you pay full price. How they could not manage to include ALL of their few chart hits is inconceivable. It is not like they have a huge catalog like an Elton John does, and have to make tough decisions of what to include or not to include in a show. Pretty lame not to have all the (albeit few) hits on their only DVD release."
3,review of mike & the mechanics . . ..,"i am a big fan of this group and was elated when i learned of the DVD. good video and sound quality. i was disappointed in the song selection, but that is a personal matter. paul carrack carries 100% of the vocals since paul young is deceased, but nevertheless a must have for mechnanics' fans!"
3,Exactly as shown!,"This item does not include a cover or boot. The box has a comment that one has to be ordered separately, but does not offer any part number to help."
1,A Great Doorstop,"This title is so bad that words simply can't do it justice... but I'll try. This is low-budget filmmaking at its absolute worst. There's no effort made toward character development or logical plot. Everything in this smacks of someone simply putting a movie together for the sake of putting a movie together... and I'm not even sure profit was the motive here, that's how amateurish this film is.Malcolm Genesis offers a review on this title that, quite frankly, I must call into question since all of his reviews are for films by Dan D'or and G. Phillip Jackson (the producers of this film and the others that he reviews). The fact that Mr. Genesis knows a little too much about these guys makes you wonder how truthful the review really is. My suggestion to you is to take a look at all the other reviews, including this one, that pans the film. Trust me on this, there's a reason why we're giving it a thumbs down."
1,Stinkeroo,"I hardly know where to begin. It was like watching the worse car wreck you have ever seen in slow motion. The story, well I don'tquite know what the heck this thing was about. The effects were pretty good, but that just makes this whole mess sadder. Quite possibilythe worst movie ever made. Im not talking plan 9 form outer space bad, at least plan 9 was funny. Must be seen to be believed { ITS REALLY THAT BAD ] But don't waste your time"
1,Question: Just how bad is this film?,"Answer: This film is so bad that free copies were given to Pocatello high school students at the senior party, along with other useless crap such as keychains, plastic windshield scrapers, and t-shirts with the local bank insignia.This film doesn't rate even 1 star; minus 20 stars is more like it."
2,Dissapointed,"I was very let down with the book. When I previewed in Amazon, it had 5 stars so I expected it to be a good first read of Alice Munro. I found the book very sluggish and couldn't keep tract of who was who or even what generation she was talking about. I didn't even finish the book, which is unusual for me."
5,Mistaken review,This seller should be a 5 star great seller. Somehow I mistakenly only gave one star.
3,Solid program,"This is a good, solid mass building program. The reason for only 3 stars is1) The book is really more of a pamphlet or newsletter. It is quite small for the cost.2) You really need to purchase the nutritional program along with it, which is also very short.Both of these combined for the price of one would have made a more ""book like"" length and justified the cost.With that said, if you are looking to do a winter ""bulking"" routine then this would be a great plan. It is basic exercise with a lot of recovery between workouts so you can really push hard when your in the gym."
4,Solid Advice,This is a great program that is easy to adapt and produces quality results. By focusing on the major muscle groups and introducing variety in to the workouts Bob keeps you growing. The book itself is pretty light in the content but the value of the material far outweighs the quality of the writing and publishing.
4,Fantastic program!,"I've been working out steadily for about 3 years, and have used a variety of exercise routines/diet plans, but this one is hands-down the best one I have used yet. I am in better shape is less time than I have ever been in my life. I bought this book because the principles behind it made sense, and I thought I'd give it a try. I couldn't be happier with the results! Why did I give it only 4 stars? Because the editing is terrible! I know the author probably just wanted to keep production cheap, which I respect, but there are some inconsistencies with what he says that don't correspond with the routines themselves. That said, don't let that minor drawback dissuade you from buying this book! If you follow it as I have, you'll look and feel great."
1,not sure about this,hey if you don't know much about flash... a great freeware to try before you use these difficult/expensive software is http://powerbullet.com
4,The Cimson Tide: An Illustrated History,"A must have for the Tide Fan. A beautiful composed book of illustrations and short stories. From the first Alabama teams to some of the most recent rumbles, this book has it all...including some great memories of Bear Bryant and Friends. Hard covered with exquisitely glossed pages. The perfect gift for others, or a special surprise for yourself!"
1,Book should include chapter on UCF win in 2000!,"This book did not include a chapter on UCF Golden Knights spoiling Alabama's homecoming in 2000! Obviously, Alabama is afraid and has pie in their face and CANNOT ADMIT IT!UCF has been in I-A football for only 5 years."
2,snowman earrings,"These earrings are for a baby - they're so tiny. I erred in buying these for myself, but had a relative's child to give them to."
5,Malo Es Bueno...,"Was way too young to remember Malo when they emerged in the early 70's. Thanks to my older cousins who introduced me to their sounds years later, I have a new found respect for this type of Latin music. I can also see where Malo and Santana have been compared to each other(brothers Jorge Santana from Malo and Carlos Santana from--well, you all know). However, the distinction I can make is that Santana uses more of a rock edge sound than Malo. Malo has a more romantic Latin dance flavor.Even in the new millennium both groups still sound hot !"
3,"I bought this CD for ""NENA"" and ""SUAVECITO"".","I bought this CD because I really liked ""NENA"" and ""SUAVECITO"" and expected the remaining music to be of the same quality but I was greatly disappointed."
4,heroes area a welcome find,"I had this music on an LP long ago and bought it to include in my CD collection. It's a welcome addition, rounding out the days when Bob Welch led the band. I must recommend this CD to listeners that want to experience the evolution of a great band."
5,BOB/CHRISTINE HISTORY SONGS!,"This a great work of art. My favorite songs are the title track and ""Come A Little Bit Closer."" Both by Christine McVie. I don't own this but I do own the boxset and listen to some songs on it. This is a wonderful album. I like it very much. The only thing I regret about is that Bob Welch gets to write more songs than Christine McVie. It's a great album any way!"
3,Hooks are hard to find,"This album was the last of the middle/ muddle period of Fleetwood Mac, between Then Play On, with the Peter Green-led band at the height of its powers, and the eponymous re-debut of the band, ushering in its merger with the duo of Buckingham and Nicks.This and the previous five LP's all suffered from the same weakness, no doubt brought about by the whirlwind of cast changes of this period. They had a few songs with infectious grooves and/or compelling riffs, but mostly they struggled to fashion mediocre and trite concepts into listenable songs.My dream concept, although I doubt anyone besides me would want to do this, would be to take the best 2 or 3 cuts from Kiln House, Future Games, Bare Trees, Penguin, Mystery to Me, and Heroes, throw in the orphaned single ""Dragonfly"", and release it on one CD. Now that would be a powerful disc!"
5,guess you had to be there . . . .,"This lp and it's cut 'Come a little bit closer' , a FM standard of 1976-77, was one of the few bright spots,musically, of what was a very dark and lethargic period in American popular music. Christine McV.'s hypnotic piano playing and hauntingly vulnerable vocals on that tune specifically and on the rest of the work,generally, make this a solid catalog buy for any serious collector . . .CML"
4,Surprisingly Great,"Having been too young to remember this album on its release and having been told that Fleetwood Mac was nothing but a blues band before the addition of Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks to the lineup, this is a fantastically interesting and listenable album. It also cements my respect for Christine McVie's contribution to the band before and after the superstardom. Fleetwood Mac seems to be able to change for the better and worse by it's added talent, and Bob Welch's work is as impressive as what came afterward in many cases."
2,Great book; terrible Kindle version,"The book itself is a beautifully written novel, but Amazon needs to demand better quality control from publishers. The Kindle version is replete with typos the detract from the reading experience. Is there some way to notify Amazon of this problem? Such errors wouldn't be acceptable in a hardbound edition and the same principle should apply here."
2,Maybe a book for a loooong winter's night,"Mark Helprin's book was extremely self-indugent. While some of the writing was beautiful and evocative, the overall feeling that I got from reading this book was that I was on a never-ending trek through a blinding snow storm. I finally took refuge in the warm feeling that there was no requirement to get to the end of this arduous journey. I left the book unfinished(unusual for me) and moved on to a more pleasant sojourn with an Ann Tyler novel."
2,Winter's Tale,"A book with so much potential and yet it served up so much dissapointment. Someone tell me, what happened to the editor after the first half of the book? Sick, busy, bored?"
2,confused,"i don't understand....this is the kindle deal of the day, but there are recent reviews indicating that the kindle version is filled with problems. why would amazon push a bad version? i guess i'll skip this one. i have to give it some stars, so i'll give it 2. but i'm just going by other reviews here of the kindle version."
5,Life affirming!,"Only book I have read several times over the years. Men love it (even non readers!) and women don't seem to get it. Pearly Soames is a memorable cad, and the Short Tails are unforgettable! Martin Scorsese suposedly bought the movie rights several years ago, I am waiting patiently- it will be a masterpiece! Lex Horbal"
5,"A unique book, exceptional use of imagry and language","In 40+ years of serious reading, I have not discovered a book more memorable or poetic. Mark Helprin's use of language is rare and beautiful. The fantasy is intriguing. As a writer entranced by the power of words, I can unhesitatingly recommend this book. I intend to buy it again, in hardcover, as a true keepsake.If you love music, this book is the equivalent of the CD of Bayless' piano transcription of Puccini's operas."
2,Disappointing,"I really liked A Soldier of the Great War and looked forward to reading Winter's Tale. What struck me as odd was that he seemed to change his story at page 193. He got so far, didn't know where to go and took a huge leap in another direction. With his time, climate, geography, and history shifting there was no place to plant your feet. Deus ex machina took over and we went wherever Helprin's imagination wished to take us. So we lost the reason why. We lost a sense of why this and not that. Even a good fantasy gives us rules that cannot be broken, some sense of perimeters that cannot be crossed. Yet Helprin captures some moments beautifully."
2,could have been great,i agree with another reviewer here--this book is simply boring. the love connection between the thief and the sick woman is pretty darn good but from there the unbelievable storyline completely loses interest. i was skimming thru the story just to finish. i wish this was better becasue it was structured to succeed.
1,Why was this book published?,"I worked for a major publisher for 20 years and was astonished at how much junk got published when manuscripts probably 10 times better were rejected by literary agents and editors. Winter's Tale is one of those cases. This is an overindulgent, overwritten, absurd piece of nonsense. I lasted 88 pages and skimmed the rest just to make sure the author didn't at some point come to his senses. He did not. Please don't waste your time on this, all the misguided good reviews notwithstanding."
1,How the Mighty have Fallen,"My first exposure to Mark Helprin was ""Soldier of the Great War"", a breathtaking novel of inspiration, beauty, poetry and eloquent writing style. Helprin's style in ""Winter's Tale"" is still eloquent, but it can't revive the flat and predictable storyline, crawling along on life support. I was heart-broken by this one."
1,Disappointing...,"I purchased this book because I read a review that compared the style of writing to one of my favorite books, ""A Trip to the Stars"" by Nicholas Christopher. I was also impressed by the incredible accolades and heartfelt devotion displayed by so many reviewers. I'm only 150 pages deep into this 700-page behemoth and each page is an uphill struggle with boredom. I haven't disliked a book this much in such a long time and I truly can't figure out where the wide-spread appeal stems from. The only reason I continue to read it is because I want to get my [money]out of it. I fear I'm only torturing myself and paying even more. I don't find the language beautiful,nor is the story compelling. The descriptions are tiresome and I CANNOT stand how the author addresses almost every character by their first and last name."
1,Not for me,"This guy writes wonderfully, which is why I bought the book...I read the first few pages, however, the story eventually flies into fantasy...I stayed with it, but it is a hefty, heavy thing, and for me, the story went too long."
2,Helprin writes huge checks he can't cash,"Overall, I found this book childish and cartoonish. Even worse, the cartoonishness wasn't even particularly funny or pleasing. In fact, much of it was extremely trite and facile.The breathless comic book exaggeration with which everything is described gets tiring very quickly.The only people who could enjoy this book, I imagine, would be people who desparately need an alternate comic book description of NYC in order to salve the years of misery they have had to endure dealing with the real thing.There is no narrative, as such, just one more outlandish development piled on after another.I came to this book with only mild expections, but even those were let down.Another book that takes a similar story telling approach is ""Perfume"" by Peter Suskind, and that only succeeds for the first half of the book. Sustaining an ominscient view magically-real narrative for even 200 pages is no simple matter."
5,I repurchased this when my first copy disappeared.,"Wonderful imagery and symbolic allusion. The author weaves his improbably tale so deftly that I found myself wanting to research portions of the story as if they were true. It is sometimes hard to tell the line between reality and pure fabrication, here. The beauty of the story carries throughout."
4,Where Is The Proofreader?,"I am not yet finished the book, which I am enjoying, however, I felt compelled to write that I was - and continue to be - extremely disappointed with the number of proofreading errors in this book. Prime example? Cocoa Van instead of coq au vin!"
3,Typos Typos Typos,"The story is wonderful, however there was obviously NO editing done before this was available for sale on the kindle. There are so many errors in the kindle edition that it is just irritating. I recently have come across a section where t's are replaced with r's.....and that goes on for a couple pages. Also, some of the typos just leave you scratching your head- in one instance.....you see >4 in the middle of a word....what is that?!?! It seems like someone was dictating this into a program, and if the program didn't recognize the word it did the best it could with what it sounded like. Hard to believe that this was available for sale with the number of errors throughout the story. Glad I only paid 1.99 for it- if I would have paid full price I would have demanded a refund."
2,Wordy and Tedious,"Mr. Helprin has imagined an outrageous premise for this story....and I'm sad to say that he totally loses it in the telling. The authors need for over the top, wordy pages of descriptions become both boring and tedious by the end of chapter 4. I gritted my teeth and finished his book purely to see if, in the end, there were any redeeming factors that would make the chore of wading through all of his prose worthwhile. Unfortunately, in my humble opinion, the answer is no."
2,Winter Tale,"Too many unnecessary words, especially adjectives. I like a good descriptive book but this was all description and no story. Had to give up on it at about 17 percent into it. What little story line there was was silly."
4,What a puzzle,"This was one of the most difficult books I have ever read. It almost took till the end to understand the entire book. If I had the time I would have begun it anew to appreciate it more. However, most of the scenes were impossible and it took a while to realize they were all metaphors, for what, I still do not know. Perhaps I will pick it up again in another decade."
2,Floundering in a snowdrift,"I picked this up based on the New York Times putting this on a list of the greatest books ever. While it starts off being somewhat of a period piece / love story, it degenerates badly into a nightmare of ridiculousness and entire pages of gibberish. Parts or it are beautifully descriptive, but it's not enough. I found it impossible to suspend disbelief and was rather resentful that I felt like I had to finish it after plowing through several hundred pages. It's a matter of taste I suppose. Be warned."
2,Couldn't finish...,"I'm sorry I didn't read the sample before I purchased this book. From the beginning on one has to wonder where the author is going with the story line especially after all the rave reviews it received. There are a million similies on every page interjected with unfinished character situations that have one wondering what just happened. Some reviewers have said it's a fantasy and filled with symbolism....but honestly, no matter how I tried, it just couldn't tickle my fancy enough to continue reading. If this is the style of Mark Helprin's writing, I don't think any of his other books will make my wish list."
2,A huge waste of time,"It's clear that readers either love or detest this novel. I was swayed by all the glowing reviews, and let's face it, the price is right. I'll admit that the imagery can be stunning at times, but it eventually becomes too overblown for its own good. Like the ""rainbow bridge of light"" it shimmers and vibrates, but for me it was a road to nowhere. Additional warning -- the typos make for an infuriating reading experience"
2,dreadful editing ruined a beautiful book,"DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE EDITION! This such a wonderful literary gem, I could not say enough praise to do it justice.How very disappointing, then, to discover that whomever edited the Kindle edition was evidently either highly intoxicated, grossly inattentive, or both. The sheer amount of typos, punctuation errors, and every other editing mistake you can think of mae this unreadable. Whomever was responsible should be smacked up along side the head with the properly edited, hardbound edition.Tl;Dr: BEAUTIFUL BOOK BUT THE KINDLE EDITION IS A SHAMEFUL EDITING NIGHTMARE"
5,One of my top ten forever!,"I first read this book in the jungles of tropical South America, where I gave its cover (the white horse flying over the city) to a campesina. Back in the states I gave the book to a friend. Big mistake, because I had to get another copy, which I read and loaned (gave away). Repeat that process three or four times, people simply won't give it back! I now have copies of all Helprin's books, not loanable, but I always recommend this one to introduce them to this wonderfully complex author! Notwithstanding his politics, he writes books that make you realize the world is truly a magical, wonderful place, and that no matter what happens, it can never annihilate you - kill you, maybe, but never, never destroy you. Winter's Tale and The Mists of Avalon score a tie for my two favorite books of all time!"
5,Just As Good the Second Time,"I just completed this book for the second time and I enjoyed it as much as the first time. Helprin's ability to imagine the charaters, places and events in this story is breathtaking. When I read this book I was both entertained by the story and in awe of Helprin for creating it."
5,An astounding piece of American literature,"This book left me absolutely breathless. As a native New Yorker I see the imagery that Mark Helprin created in this incredible work almost every day! I could swear that while riding the Staten Island ferry in my daily commute, that I have seen the great fog bank rolling in in the distance. As I look out at Bayonne, New Jersey in the distance, I can almost hear the Baymen slogging through the marshes digging for oysters. It is a wonderfully imaginative book and should be on everyone's book shelf."
2,Winter's Tale,"Very hard to follow, confusing, all over the place. I have never not finished a book and couldn't bother continuing to read this."
1,Strange and Not So Wonderful,"As a big fan of Mark Helprin's Freddy & Fredericka and A Soldier of the Great War, I was excited about this novel. I was prepared to employ some ""suspension of disbelief"" and was not suprised to encounter flying horses and mythical tribes in the first few chapters. Unfortunately it didn't end there. The story became SO abstract and convoluted that It was distracting. Some of the other negative reviews of this book indicate that the readers didn't finish it. I was determined not to give up and now wish I had followed their lead."
1,Like Listening to a Boring Intellectual,I purchased the book because a co-worker said it was his favorite book. The story starts off with an exciting edge and it kept my interest for a bit. The love story between a middle aged man and a much younger girl is nothing new. The author is too descriptive and long winded for my taste. It did not have to take over 600 pages to tell a story.
2,Lost In The Snow,"Beautiful prose is not enought to save this book. I enjoyed the first third and was moved by the loss of Beverly Penn, but by the end of the tome I frankly didn't care who lived or died when the Apocalypse arrived. It was a surprise to find out that only middle class urban journalists and their friends will actually go to heaven while the poor burn in their hovels. Having said that, Helprin is capable of writing a great novel; A Soldier of The Great War remains one of my favourites."
1,Just Don't Get It,"I only read the first 20 or so pages, because I couldn't get interested in this far-fetched tale. It may be as good as others say, but I don't have time or the inclination to keep reading a book that doesn't hold my interest."
1,Boring,I did not even get to 2nd chapter. It was totally boring. I just could not continue to read. ThaNK YOU FOR THE OFFER So sorry ..thaNK YOU nywY
1,Worst Book I ever bought,"I can't remember what made me purchase this book, because it sure was a waste of money. It is too difficult to follow, it doesn't seem to have a story, just people, unbelievable people, who really aren't doing any thing except running around New York. I have tried and tried to get into this book and can not. I don't think I will ever finish it, it does not hold my interest, I keep reading in hopes that it will get better, but it doesn't."
4,A Mystical Read,"I am so glad this book took many hours to read. Whenever I read a book I love, I want it to go on and on. Winter's Tale was a book I thought I would like because I loved Helprin's other books. And I was not disappointed. The language is what grabs me when I read Helprin. A beautiful description, an unusual word pairing or a way of presenting an improbable image, is one of my favorite reasons for reading. Winter's Tale does all that. Many reviewers have given the bones of the story so I won't go there. However, the editing just about drove me crazy. I kept trying to overlook the typos-I counted them as I went-but it became so irritating. But I am glad I did not stop reading just because I was irritated with the editor and I would never let it stop me from the many hours of enjoyment I got from reading A Winter's Tale. The poor editing did effect the reading and hence the number of stars. This book deserved the best editing possible."
3,Beautiful but labyrinthine,I think that Mark Helprin is truly deft in his crafting of the English language and of imagery. Paragraphs and pages of this book are a pleasure in an of themselves. That said I have to admit to not being able to get into this book. It seemed to drift for me.
3,"Started out good, but then tappered off into the unknown","I can't lie when I saw I don't really know what to make of this book in the end. Imaginative and different, yes, but perhaps that is not a good aspect in this case. It was too much of those things to make it a book worth recommending.The first part of it, which is like 150 pages was magnificent and I couldn't put it down, but then it became dull and the newer characters I got introduced to did not interest me whatsoever. The story life didn't grasp my soul as it may have other readers because of these new characters, and how their story didn't quite fit with the beginning.Also I didn't understand the time travel that was going on with Peter Lake, or the people that seemed to be stuck in the present. In short, too many pages for a story that doesn't capture my imagination."
2,Stop the madness! What the eff is everyone talking about?,"A decent book, but grossly overrated by the Amazon community. I'll keep this short.The good- Helprin is an excellent writer. A master of descriptive prose.The bad- He spends too much time mired in elaborate descriptions without adequate character development- As I neared the conclusion of the book I found myself indifferent not only to how the book ends, but also what happens to the characters. Not a good sign in my view- While the cover and the synopsis on the back call for an enchanting description of old NY. I feel obliged to warn you. 1) This book contains a flying horse. 2) Only about 40% of the book actually takes place in NY City.Buy this book if you are interested in fantasy, lore, symbolism and tall tails. Do NOT buy this book if you were looking for Romeo and Juliet meets Gangs of New York, or a flowing story about love and life in the best city in the world."
2,I don' t get it.,"There is some wonderful writing and imagery in this book. However, I found this book a long, wandering conglomeration of scenes that seemed to be more of a collection of ideas than the buildings of a plot. The creative language could not make up for the lack of a coherent story. If there was a big message in this book, I missed it. The only reason I even finished the book was because it was a selection of our book club.Maybe the secret is you have to be a New Yorker to love this book...what do I know, I'm from Boston."
1,I don't get it,"Reading this novel was like trying to ski downhill with snow up to your thighs. I kept thinking that I would eventually understand what some of these positive reviewers were going on about. My mother and I read this book at the same time and she finished first. She warned me that if I was confused after the first 200 hundred pages I would not feel any better after 500 pages. I should have listened. Thousands of beautiful words strung together does not make a story great if there is little to no plot, character development or connection to reality. I wish I understood what the author is trying to say but it really shouldn't be that hard. I like challenging novels but I just didn't feel any reward when I reached the last page."
4,"Lyrical, Beautiful writing, but not quite magical","Like many reviewers, I loved the first half of the book much more than the last half. When reality seemed to slip away without explanation, I began to lose touch with the author's tale, particularly at the end. However, I could not stop reading it. No words of mine can begin to describe the beautiful style of writing. Helprin is one of the greatest American authors in any century!"
2,"Amazing Book, Amazing Amount of Typos!",This is an important and wonderful book. How did Amazon let so many typos through? It is a real distraction and I would advise reading a print copy until this situation has been resolved
1,Fire the Editor,"I mean no offense to the author, and may try again to read this book if I come across it in paperback. But REALLY? Typographical errors began in the very first paragraph of this Kindle eBook, and I couldn't stand it. Clearly the publisher of the Kindle edition didn't edit at all, and has no regard for the reader. I am appalled."
3,Not for everyone,"This book was very slow starting. I almost gave up on it several times. A good story, but very wordy."
2,Stuck on a scenic train,"The author uses wonderful descriptions, which get in the way of the plot. It was like being on a train stuck in the mountains. For a while you can enjoy the scenery, but after a while you want the train to move on."
2,A (long & boring) ode to New York,"Winter's tale is a series of connected vignettes taking place in Manhattan and upper state New York, spanning more than a century. It is really an ode to a fictionalized version of New York City, from its slums to the homes of its movers and shakers. It is the tale of the search for the perfectly just golden city, that New York is (unbeknownst to most of its inhabitants) striving to become.Winter's Tale is a maddening book. Helprin is an extremely gifted writer and individual passages are a delight to read. But the story meanders over its 600 pages. There is no coherent plotline. All I can say is that it took me 6 months to wade through it. It is long and it is dull."
1,Title,I never finished this book. A weird tale that is at the same time reality and others mystical. I could not get into it even after 200 plus pages
1,This book was going where?,Could not get into. The writer was all over the place. Did not get past the first 40 pages even though I tried.
2,Dissapointing,"I'm a fan of Helprin's, based on having read and enjoyed ""Refiner's Fire"" and ""A Soldier Of The Great War"". I found ""Winters Tale"", however, to be a big dissapointment. There's a fine story contained in its 700- plus pages, but its buried in so much unecessary and flowery prose that the interesting parts are like islands separated by an ocean of words. Like the two books cited above, Helprin makes use of magic realism here, but while it was used to good effect in smaller doses in those works, ""Winters Tale"" chokes on it. Helprin seems to be showing off here, and the writing sounds self-indulgent and calculated to impress the literati, rather than entertain the average reader. A word to the wise: if you haven't yet read ""Winters Tale"", try ""Refiner's Fire"" or ""A Soldier Of The Great War"" instead. You'll be justly rewarded, and come away with a much more flattering impression of this author."
3,magical realism with expressionism over-tones,"The author may not like magical realism, but for me, this heading most clearly defines this novel. When a story and its characters waver and shimmer so that the reader never gets a good feel for them while at the same time staring them in the eye page after page; what else can someone say then to announce that they have been bewitched. For me, in the end, the novel's spell proved neutral in that i was neither mesmerized nor repulsed. As for the specifics the good points of this novel were: originality, creativity, and a strong sense of purpose - the bad were: plot drifting, clutter and a sense that the editor fell asleep at the wheel (not to mention the e-book typo's which are too numerous to recount).As with most three star reviews, in the end, i really don't have any strong opinions about this novel other then to say that for me - it read long."
3,beautiful.....but odd,"It is rare that I am unable to finish a book. I read alot. But, I cannot finish this one. I find myself dreading picking this book up. There are pleasureable bits and pieces, and the wording is beautiful.Georgous in fact...and maybe, just maybe, the story will get somewhere, but I am on page 393, and although I get the plot and the theory of this book, I find that it means nothing to me. I quit! I am not much of a fantasy reader, and maybe that is my mistake in picking this one. It has an element of reality and history mixed in with sheer fantasy which mixed together really frustrate me. As Charlie Brown would say......AGHHHHHHHHHH! My advice: give it a try. Maybe you will like it...but if you get 150 pages into this book and it doesn't grab you, then don't waste your reading time. Good luck :)"
2,Winter's Tale,"Very convoluted, with rampant hyperbole that was to be taken as literal....and too much non-sensical gibberish that I couldn't see how it advanced the story or mood. I was very disappointed."
5,TO BE REREAD OVER AND OVER AND OVER.....,"Someone once asked me what would be the ONE book I would choose to have on that infamous deserted island we could all be stuck on some day - After much deliberation, I narrowed it down to this one. I have loved this book from the moment it was published and have given dozens of copies away."
5,Transcendent and Profound,"Much ground has been covered in previous reviews. What is important about the book is its profound effect on its readers. It has not been diminished, but has been enhanced, through time. I can think of no other book that has given me greater perspective on the juxtaposition and tension between past, present and future. An astounding book that still leaves me breathless."
5,Shimmering imagery that lives in my mind years later...,"So much has already been said, so I won't repeat. Let me just say two things. One, I don't know anything about Mark Helprin being classist or elitist...I've never gotten that. Second, I think if I could only ever recommend one book to anyone to ever read, this would be the one."
4,Great Book,I really enjoyed this book. My great grandfather was a coal miner in Kentucky in the 20's and so this book really helped me understand they way of life during that time and what he must have gone through. I am truly amazed at Karen Tintori's versatility in writing...reading Something Borrowed/Something Blue and now I am currently reading The Book of Names...I am very impressed. I can't wait to read Unto the Daughters.
5,True account,"This is a great, sad account of a disaster that I have heard about for all my life. James Cherry, superintendent of the mine and for whom the mine and the town of Cherry, IL, were named, was my great-grandfather. I am grateful to the author for providing a true account of that awful day."
4,A local point of view,"I live 5 miles from Cherry, and we have already had a local author who retold the story several years ago, so I was interested to read the new version of events. The author has obviously done her research well, and attempted to relay the events in a logical sequence, but I felt the text needed more diagrams, possibly a glossary of mining terms. A list of the dead is included, but a list of survivors would be interesting from a local point of view."
4,stubby flex wrenches for working on my plane,makes it easy to get to hard to reach places. used very numerous times for routine maintenance tasks on my plane. Liked them so well also bought some for my mechanic.
5,Loved every second of it!,"Okay, Gena Showalter doesn't disappoint with this one. The characters are awesome, the plot is awesome, the dialogue is awesome, everything is freaking awesome. You don't need to know more, really. This is a must.If you have a taboo on romance novels, then I recommend you to start with this novel, or any Gena Showalter's novel. She does know how to write and captivate one's attention--completely. You won't put it down until you're done"
1,Playing With Fire? STOP PLAYING WITH READERS!!!,"Cute, Quirky story - but was released before - the authors and publishing companies have to stop duping readers into thinking this is a new story by placing a new cover on it and changing publsihing venues. What is being done to the reader is deciptive and dowright stealing - I almost feel like Bernie Maddoff has something to do with this! Ms. Showalter - you are very talented - I like your work - STOP STEALING FROM READERS!!!"
5,Amazing Book! Great read.,"This was an amazingly hilarious paranormal romance!! I loved the dialogue and the way that the herione reacted and interacted with others. She says the things that we are all thinking. The hero is super hot and the interactino between the two of them is downright laugh out loud funny. This is a must read for any fan of the genre. Sit back, be prepared to laugh and have a good time.I can not wait to see what is next for this series."
3,Playing With Fire,"This book is about a woman named Belle who gets something put in her coffee, she gets sick and when she finally wakes up there is a man in her room.Rometells her she can control the elements and that he is also something supernatural. This book is about Belle learning how to try and control her new powers and the problems that comes with. She andRomestart to fall for each other and try to figure out who is trying to kill/ kidnap her. This book was interesting and had a lot going for it. The secondary characters were really funny and added the conflict that needed to move the book along. As much as I liked the writing and story line, I had to rate this book lower because the main character bugged me. I thought that Belle was really immature and that she had a tendency to whine a lot. I also had a problem when at the beginning she uses her boobs to get out of being in trouble with her boss. I borrowed this book from library and I did like it but I don't think I am going to buy it"
4,No Lending,"WARNING. The Gena Showalter ebooks I've bought to date do not allow lending. I still love her books, but will wait until I go to the bookstore to buy future titles."
2,disappointing,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. The concept intrigued me and I've read and enjoyed other books by Ms Showalter. But I had trouble following the plot. I gave up half way into the book. I couldn't even finish it. It just didn't hold my interest, Dick"
4,Gena Showalter is full of awesome!,"Playing with Fire is the first novel in Gena Showalter's Tales of an Extraordinary Girl series. This book was so much fun. I felt it could easily be mistaken for a young adult novel because of the cover and title. Be warned this one is definitely NOT for kids. This book contains several steamalicious scenes.The characters in Playing with Fire were fabulous. Belle is the twenty-something protagonist who has to learn to control her new superhero powers. Rome is the sexy bad boy sent to kill her. All of the secondary characters were a blast too. The author must have a killer sense of humor because this book was full of quick-witted and sarcastic dialogue. It made me laugh out loud many times. I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in the series, Twice as Hot."
4,Another Must Read book by Gena Showalter,"After the Atlantis Series I was hooked on Gena's writing. This is a different type of setting, but the setting and subject matter are very compelling. I love all the wonderful interplay between the characters. Working on reading another one of Gena's book now."
2,Bummer - I'd hoped for more...,"The cover is great. The teaser blurb is great. So I expected a book handling the idea of chemically induced mutation and the resulting problems of suddenly acquired super powers in a younger lady. Or at least a rousing and heroic battle against the forces of evil. Or maybe even the learning experience of new powers. A neat premise...The hope gets lost in the many long and loving descriptions of hard nipples, how they turn hard, why they turn hard, and what they turn hard for. And respective other body parts.Oh well.... Not going to re-read it to look for redeeming features..."
2,Blah,"The book, for me, started out badly. Belle's interactions with her customers were painful. Belle was incompetent, but then seemed surprised when her customers were upset. And the customers were unrealistically rude.Belle's whole attitude bothered me. She was concerned about her father and being able to provide for him, but couldn't keep a job for more than a couple weeks. And her reasoning for her inability to hold down a job - dissatisfaction with her life - was flimsy.I just couldn't make myself care for Belle, and while the storyline was ok, it didn't make up for my annoyance with Belle."
2,"Little strategy, no technical help","This book is easily read in a couple of hours. It goes over the basic elements of the game in a thourough manner but lacks any hard technical information.It's useful to read to get some basics, but the internet is a 1000% better source for dealing with character development strategy.Nothing on the arguments regarding what is best item, what skills are useful in combination or any information on multiplayer strategies."
2,Outdated right from the start,"I have preordered this strategy guide with Diablo II Collector's Edition back from april. And when I receive them in July and start playing the game, I found out a lot of information stated in the strategy guide is already outdated. I also found out there are alot, and I mean like %70, of the information missing. The description of the skills are too short and simple. There are almost no mention of how two or more effect affect each other. Not to mention missing creature types, item types, etc. After applying Patch ver 1.03, half of the already little amount of information is obsolete. If you want to learn more about the game, and there is a huge amount of things to learn, goto a fan site like diabloii.net or game site like gamespot.com. You will find much detailed and updated information there."
2,Outdated,"This strategy guide has several problems.First, it was outdated since the first patch of Diablo II to 1.03. Several skill tables are just not true anymore.Then it is not complete. No normal item descriptions, requirements, exceptional items, detailed monster information are just not there.The Chaos Sanctuary at Blizzard's website is better than this book.I'm playing Diablo II since its release; both with single player and with realm characters."
4,"Helpful but not perfect,","The Diablo II strategy guide was had some interesting facts on everything in the game. Very little was left out, and so it was helpful. If you're a strategy guide type person this is worth it's money. However, I wish I wouldn't have bought it because it spoils some of the fun in the game."
3,"A good resource, but ...","As are all of these types of guides, the resource is good, with listings of monster types, weapons and quest walkthroughs. However, you could save yourself the money and find most (if not all) of this information on the net. What this guide gives you is the convenience of having it all at your fingertips, gorgeous maps, etc. and not having to waste time to try and find it online."
1,Hardcore Diablo Fan??? Not with this book,"After extensively playing all 5 classes through Nightmare and Hell difficulties, i decided to read this book while browsing in a shop... Wow... Whoever wrote this obviously never played the game more extensively then Act I, and if you ever want to build a decent character, avoid this guides advice at all costs... Examples: Necromancers revives do NOT benefit anything from additional points to revive, neither do their skeletons or skeleton mages... Thats what Skeleton Mastery does... Terrible guide... don't buy it! Izawwlgood"
1,What a disappointment...,"Whereas the Guide to Diablo (one), was insightful and helped separate the wheat from the chaff, as well make weird but creative suggestions, this Guide for Diablo II is simply a rehash of stuff that's already out there for free. Save your money, hopefully someone will come out with an unauthorized version that will be worth the money."
2,I wish there were more hints,The hints weren't that good. And the book didn't provide me with very many spoilers. It seemed to be a more detailed version of the manaual as oppose to an actual strategy guide
1,Diablo2 Guide Sinks,This book stinks to put it bluntly. You cant have a stradegy guide to a game thats maps change constantly. It also taks all the fun out of exploring and finding things out for yourself. The only good part about it is: it tells you how much damage a spell does before you can pick on your skill chart. If i could I'd give it Half a star. If i were you I'd buy Diablo 2 and not touch the stradegy guide.
1,this guide sux...,"this guide sux! it doesnt give any overall characterstrategies, and tells you everything you DONT need to know aboutquests - i dont care how to find the boss, tell me how to kill him! italso makes the bad skills seem good, which caused me to WASTE SKILLPTS on them. it also doesnt show how good some skills are. the guidesdoesnt show the damages for weapons, or even mention exceptionalitems. blizzards official website gives more info, and for free! italso has more pictures, and in color. i thought the guide would giveinformation not on the site - which MOST guides do. but no, it wasjust a waste of money. id get a better guide if i went to kinkos andtold them to print out and bind the whole blizz site."
2,Something for stupid people,"The only thing I found useful in this guide was the list of items. Everything else in the guide has either been outdated, or is just some crap opinion from some guy saying that ""It would be powerful if you did this..."" and it's really only something useful in a single player game when you're just messing around.I suggest to anyone that plays Diablo2, to just enjoy the game and look up anything they need to know about items on websites. All the other info in this book is pretty much useless, and becomes your own knowledge within a week of playing on your own anyways!"
1,I'd rate it with .5 stars!,"Too bad one-half of a star isn't an option, because this is by FAR the worst strategy guide I've had the misfortune of buying. I'd played through Act I and was starting Act II when I bought this guide, and when I leafed through the pages, I realized how gypped I was! A majority of the information is outdated, now that I have the newest patch. I've got first hand experience with the game, and this is really inaccurate. If you want a decent guide for this game, hope Prima makes one. They know how to do it, their Diablo guide was awesome. BradyGames should call them up and take notes. This game guide is missing weapon and monster details. People want details in a game like this. Even the quest section is bad. It gives a brief, ineffective walkthrough. And, not that it hampers comprehension, but there are spelling and grammatical errors abound. I only recommend buying this if you are a die-hard fan of the game."

Terrible guide... don't buy it! Izawwlgood@hotmail.com"
1,BIG WASTE OF MONEY,"First of all, anyone who wrote a review and gave the it 5 stars...GIVE ME A BREAK! Look at what they wrote. Obviously it was either the author or someone from his publisher's office. Simply put, this book is a waste of money. Do you want some good info? Look on the net. You must already be on the net if you can read this, so go find your answer. Blizzard did a disservice to the people who bought the game by intentionally leaving out information in the game manual. We SHOULD NOT have to buy a third party game book in the first place.Well that's my opinion"
1,DIABLO II,"I can't see how any one can give this guide 4 1/2 stars. The book gives few, if any, insights into the game for any player of Diablo I. I have played D1 for years and have had a lot of help from that guide. If I give the D1 guide four stars for the help it gives, I would be generous if I gave this guide book one star. In a nutshell, poor at best. If you have read the D1 guide don't expect any help on characters. The only help this book gives is the quest description. It seems to have been written by someone who has never played a game in their life. I'd pass on it unless you have $ to burn."
4,It is a good commentary on Yoga Sutra for western aspirants of Yoga system.,Authers have very lucidly explained the terse aphorisms of Patanjili Maharshi to grasp the essence of the philosophy of a great Indian tradition.
4,Perfect for understanding Yoga Sutras,"I'm in a yoga certification course and the instructor recommended we have the book. It's great! Really helps in understanding the Yoga Sutra's. It's not something you pick-up and can't put down, more the read a little bit everyday type of book. Kind of like an apple a day."
5,Simply Excellent,"The first I heard of Patanjali's aphorisms was through George Harrison's song 'Brainwashed' which captions thoughts on the Soul. Intrigued, I searched this book out and had a beautiful and subtle enhancement to my meditation practices as a result.I recommend this book, which was co-authored by two Vedanta followers (for more about Vedanta please see http://www.vedanta.org/wiv/overview.html)of quite diverse backgrounds. It is an exceptionally readable text."
5,Yogic Flying,"""How To Know God: The Yoga Aphorisms of Patanjali"" (from my understanding)is required reading for anyone interested in beoming a Sidha and practicing Yogic Flying. The process of Samyama (concentration, meditation, and absorption) creates a clarity of mind that is highly focused. A fascinating study and is an essential reference for anyone who teaches and practices Yoga."
1,Not recommended,"This is not a good translation and in addition the authors add so much commentary that wanders away from the meaning (and is often completely tangential to the meaning), that this book cannot be recommended. One wonders to what extent the writers have actually meditated. There are better translations with better commentary."
5,Blankie,"My son loves horses and his blankies!We looked everywhere for a horse blankie,but no store had them. He was very happy to recieve this on his birthday.It is nice and soft and he takes it with him everywhere now!"
5,very cute,adorable and really soft; it's also nice to have a horse instead of the typical bear or doll. it's also small enough for an infant to grasp and a toddler to carry around
5,Plush Spotted Paint/brown Horse,"Adorable horse blankie friend for baby. I bought this for my unborn little boy, and can't wait for him to use it! Good quality, and exactly what I was expecting! Thanks Amazon for offering this for such a great price! Perfect, toy for your little cowboy or cowgirl!!!"
4,Horse lovie,"The questions for the ratings really don't apply to this, since its not a toy, but a child's lovie. My son received this as a gift and LOVED it. He's 2 years old and its his best friend. It goes everywhere with him. Well, Mom washed it one day and he really wanted it. But you can't really give a child a wet lovie. So, Dad decided to dry it - quickly. So he pulled out the hair dryer and ended up burning the hair on the main....which resulted in hard hair and a few holes. Dad was devastated he destroyed the lovie. Mom quickly got on amazon and searched and found an exact copy. It arrived a few days later, at first my son didn't like it because it was new smelling. So, Mom made sure to hold it as much as possible to get the new smell out and bring on more of Mommy smell - it worked and he doesn't realize its a different one and he's back to being one happy kiddo with his lovie."
5,Animals in the Womb,Very informative! Happy with this video and will donate it to the local library for others to enjoy!
3,Was $3.99 at Cost Plus in 2004,"I really like these. But the fact that the price is more than double what I bought it for in 2004 on State Street in Santa Barbara, California is too much (Santa Barbara ain't cheap either). Wow, many are making less money and the price of Fido glass jars more than doubles??? They're just made out of glass, right? The product is decent, but 2 jars costed me $7.98 before and now I have to pay $21.70??? Oi vey!"
1,Broken,"I purchased this from Amazon for my son as a gift to keep his sour dough start in. However, when the Bormioli Rocco Fido Round Clear Jar arrived it was broken. Glass shards all over the box. We decided to return it and they wanted the broken bottle returned also. What are they going to do with the glass shards? Disappointed with this purchase."
3,Not as air tight as I hoped,"It is a little bit of a struggle to close the jar, didn't keep as airtight as I had hoped and I have to close it slowly to keep it all in line with the rubber sealer that goes around the rim. Still this jar looks great for storing things like herbs and spices. :)"
5,Great for pantry storage,The seal is tight fitting. The glass is heavy and durable. I use mine in my pantry for storing various dry goods in my pantry. I will be ordering more.
4,jars,"They are decent jars. There is not much to say about jars, other than what I do with them, and sometimes that scares me. Right now my 2 jars are currently incubating Kombucha scobys and that means I have a cupboard with 2 jars that looks like they have alien fetuses suspended in brown liquid. If you too want to have such an interesting cupboard...purchase this product."
3,Diss appointing,The wire connector holding the cap and base bottle come apart very easily. This is the first time I've been disappointed in an Amazin purchase.
2,Broken Glass,"I ordered 2 cartons of the glass jars. I love the jars they made beautiful baby shower gifts. These were going to be decorated for my daughter's surprise baby shower that just passed on July 14th. However i was so disappointed3 jars came broken. Now "" I am short 3 baby shower favors "" How do i get in touch with the company to ask them to send me a replacement for the 3 Jars that came broken from delivery ?? i did not know they were broken until i started putting the favors together the night before the surprise baby shower party. I will rate better when i receive the 3 replacement jars... Help Now i owe 3 more favors to the invites that came :("
5,We read it every night,"What a neat little book! Easy to read, colorful, and even talks about using the potty. My youngest won't go to bed without reading it! Sweet!"
3,Kat's Kind Review,"The children's book Maisy's Bedtime by Lucy Collins was not a very interesting book. I think the only reason that it was not very interesting to me was because I am an older child and the book was angled towards younger children. The book basically tells how Maisy gets ready for bed. It tells every single step that she takes in order to get to bed. For instance she has to close her bedroom curtains, then she had to put on her pajamas, brush her teeth, use the bathroom etc; I would only recommend this book to children that are the ages 2 to 6."
4,A fresh look at Penn's wisdom,"Penn's wisdom was timeless and practical. The truth that scored three hundred years ago is still hitting the mark today. Mr. Taylors' modern language edition sharpens the point for modern readers and helps the spiritual truths penetrate. Without the barrier of archaic language, Penn shines through all the more.The historical introduction alone makes this book a good buy. Mr. Taylor has boiled a sea of Biographical information into a salty context that gives the reflections a better flavor.Get it! Read it! Do it!"
1,Revenge of the Snob Squad,"Subject matter NOT appropriate for elementary grades because it is full of name-calling, hate, sneakiness, deceipt, lying, breaking of school rules, etc. Introduces children to ""psychic stuff""."
1,This book is USELESS...,"Don't waste your money and time on this book.I can't believe someone actually allowed this book to be published as ""Step By Step"". It seems the intention of writing this book was just to get something out or the author has no idea how to write a ""Step By Step"" book.The first three chapters are basically about the history of Web development and how ASP.Net is better. Then suddenly, in chapter four, he jumps into ""Custom Rendered Controls"". With a few short descriptions, he closes the chapter and the frustration begins. You begin to think, what is this chapter has anything to do with a ""Step By Step"" and do a project. Next he gets into ""Composite Controls"". He covers it in a hurry and it's to the next chapter. A very short overview of Validation, Treeview and MultiView.You keep reading and thinking that I'm eventally going to get something going to finish a project. But you'll be building frustration than an ASP project.This is by far the worst book I have ever read!"
1,Don't waste your time or money,One star is too high a rating. This book has far too many errors and omissions. You will find yourself having to debug the examples in the book. The published errata is a joke. There are 10 times as many mistakes. Weak.
1,Disappointing,"This book is poorly organized, and does not really deliver the goods as an introductory tutorial.Recently, I have been fairly impressed with the software books from Microsoft Press. But this one is almost enough to drive me back to Wrox, which is saying quite a bit."
2,dont bother,"I have worked through the first six chapters and it just gets worse and worse. The code, both in the text and the CD is laced with errors. There are sudden jumps with no explanation. I do think the choice of topics and the examples are well chosen but the book book is so sloppily edited that it is not worth the time and money. This is more like a rough draft than a final copy. I am an experienced C# programmer and this book has caused a lot of frustration and time waste.I would be ashamed to have my name on something this shoddy."
1,Do not buy this,Absolutely dreadful if you expect to learn step by step. The accuracy of the text and level of detail is simply not sufficient.
1,"Houston, we have a problem",If you are a programmer who is smart enough to be hired by Microsoft -- this is the book for you. For the rest of us mere mortals -- buy something else.
1,This book is useless!!!!,Dont buy this book. Many omissions and typo errors. You will spend all your time trying to get the examples to work.
4,This is NOT a useless book,"I have read some reviews here and found them a little harsh. I can understand them feeling bad because they really intended it to be beginner's book, showing everything step-by-step. Unfortunately this is not the case, but I wish the the title was different not the content. The contents are well written, but not exactly for somebody entirely new to ASP.NET.I would give in between 3.5 to 4 stars."
4,good introduction to ASP.NET,"I found this book to be an excellent introduction to ASP.NET. Some reviewers have stated that the chapters at the beginning of the book are too complex. This material is, however, fundamental to developing the ability to program ASP.NET pages effectively.The step-by-step format provides a good introduction to the major aspects of ASP.NET along with significant practice in working with Visual Web Developer, pages, and web controls. An extended example showing how all of the pieces fit together would have been nice but there are other books that serve this purpose quite well.I deducted a star, however, because some of the examples do not work as they are written in the book (they might have been fixed on the CD but I lost mine so I am not sure). This was frustrating but I still found the book to be a valuable introduction."
1,Disappointed highly,"No doubt the author knows subject matter. Before releasing this book, some one should have asked several people who dont know asp.net to actually use the book and learn form it by following step by step in each of the chapters to the 'T', they would have found out that they cannot do it.Too many errors, and missing steps. This is not a step by step book, it should be called ""Missing steps book"", it is not for some one who does not already know asp.net; then again if you already know why would you want to get this book anyway."
1,What not to do with your examples cd,In the book it says that the CD examples are installed to c:\aspnetstepbystep\examples. In real life it is installed to C:\Microsoft Press\ASP.NET 2.0 Step by StepIn the book the web is shone to be ASPNETStepByStep. In real life it installs to aspnet2sbs.selectfeature2.htm calls for http://localhost/HttpHandlers/selectfeature2.htm but your CD does not set up a HttpHandlers site.I am on page 10 and have found this much already. How much of the code that is shown and installed will fail because of these problems?
4,Good book,It is a good introductory book for ASP 2.0. Author lives up to his reputation. Book is easy to read and has good explanation of examples.
4,Instructional,"Length:: 0:56 MinsThe pictures and some of the words are small, but this is a good book to read when you want to explore feeling with your children. Some of the feelings discussed are happy, proud, angry, sorry, scared, jealous, The pictures and some of the words are small, but this is a good book to read to explore feeling in your children. Some of the feelings discussed are happy, proud, angry, sorry, scared, jealous, guilt, brave, shyness, sadness, peacefulness, bored, and many others."
5,Wonderful tool,"My husband bought this for our son, who is three. It has been his favorite book for several weeks now. The book is separated into smaller stories and we read one or two at night before going to bed. It's been a wonderful tool to use to help teach our son about his feelings, about others' feelings."
2,Too short,I think this video should of been a lot longer its to much money for only 30 min. it goes into detail but not step by step and it is very basic
1,Save your money.,I was very unimpressed with the video. It was very short on wing chun basics. If your looking to learn wing chun from a videotape. Go look for Augustine Fong's instructional videos.
5,Win-Chun Today,"I have been waiting for this video! Because of my schedule, I don't have the time to train at a Wing Chun school. I have bought many of the other Wing Chun video's and they have not been clear enough for me to follow along. They usually have the same two guys in the same room for thirty minutes demonstrating technique's that only a student of Wing Chun could pick out. Wing Chun Today is very thorough, and very detailed. This video is very easy to follow and corrects the faulty technique as you go. With a combination of beautiful scenery and detailed instruction, Wing Chun Today will keep you interested to the end!"
1,clouding the truth with glorified impressions,I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU PURCHASE A VIDEO YOUR GETTING A VIDEO. YOU CANNOT LEARN THE TRUTH FROM SOMETHING YOU SEE ON TV. A TRUE MASTER WOULD NOT GIVE FALSE HOPES OF SELF ACCOMPLISHMENT THROUGH A TRAINING VIDEO.WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW A PROFESSIONAL IN THE WORK PLACE THAT LEARNED THERE SKILL FROM A VIDEO? MR.LAU SHOULD BE WISE ENOUGH TO NOT GO DOWN THE COMMERCIAL PATH AND GIVE A BAD NAME FOR THE ART AND HIMSELF.MY EXPERIENCE WITH HIM IN THE PAST IS THAT HIS STUDENTS WERE LEARNING THE WING CHUN STYLE BUT COULD NOT BEAT THE STUDENTS OF OTHER SCHOOLS THAT WERE LEARNING THE CORRECT METHODS OF WING CHUN.I PERSONALLY HAVE PUT A FEW OF HIS STUDENTS ON THE FLOOR WITHOUT BREAKING A SWEAT.ENJOY THE DORKY SELF-INVOLVED VIDEO.
5,"Bravo, Sifu Lau!","I am a student of Wing Chun in Brooklyn NY. In the past, I have been mostly dissapointed with martial arts videos; either they try to pack too much into a video so you can't follow what's going on, or they offer too little for the would-be-student. When my friend told me I had to see this video, I was skeptical, but consented. Boy was I impressed! The video was done very well (not like many others that seem to have been done in someone's basement) and Sifu Lau's explanation of basic concepts were quite lucid, as were his explanations highlighting some of Wing Chun's basics. His sense of humor and dynamic presence made the video more interesting as well. The demonstration of the Sil Lum Tao by one of his students was excellent, textbook done! I think I'll have to get my own copy now. (By the way, I hear there is a 2nd volume coming out. If it's as good as this one, send it to me now!)"
2,"Don't be fooled, these are generic","I have installed these labels in my dymo printer, and they seem to be working fine. However, it is entirely unethical to show pictures of ""DYMO"" packaging and use the ""DYMO"" description and then send generic labels. I'm sure the dymo people wouldn't be real happy about that either.If you are selling generic product, then say it in the description. But misleading customers, regardless of the quality, is poor business."
1,no delivery confirmation,I needed these bad. I ordered rush overnight delivery. Guess what? No Delivery confirmation on these labels. The 30387 are supposed to have delivery confirmation. These do not. Don't waste your time ordering with Amazon. Order these through stamps.com You will get the correct item through them
5,Dymo 30387 Internet Postage was described as advertised.,Length:: 0:20 MinsDymo 30387 Internet Postage is the real deal.
5,"Forget the ""hound"" - go for DIONNE","Talented, amazing, pin-up good looks, and a really nice guy. The heck with the movie. Go to see Michael Dionne. And watch out Messrs. Pitt, Clooney etc. You have competition sneaking up from behind. You GO GET 'EM, Michael."
1,BIG BAD WEREWOLF......NOT!!!,This is one of the worst Werewolf movies on the market today. Do not waste your money like I did. I only gave it one STAR because I had too.
2,Werewolf: Thre Devil's Hound,"A vicious but alluring she-wolf breaks free from her crate while being transported to her new home, and it isn't long before she sinks her teeth in to the locals while seeking out a new mate. WEREWOLF suffers from a complete lack of identity that causes the entire film to suffer. On the one hand, it attempts to be a straightforward creature feature with a unique costume design and a decent amount of gore and bloody FX. On the other hand, the amateurish filming techniques and ridiculous attempts at humor distract from the horror and give the film an unintentionally goofy tone. As the limbs begin flying, heads start rolling, and jugulars continue to spew, any fans with a decent amount of patience and a love for low-budget animal flicks should be able to stick this one out until the end for its cheesy B-Movie charm and cheap gags, but there is no mistaking that this is terrible Horror at its finest.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
1,Oh My Goodness Gracious!,"After about 30 minute's or so I actually fell asleep. Based upon the brief interaction I had with this abominable film, I must in all honesty say, ...... This is quite nearly the worst film I .... NEVER SAW!"
1,This movie bites the big one!!!,SPOILER ALERTIt could have been a pretty good low rate movie. The s/f wasn't too bad but the story telling and acting was downright scarier than the movie. It could really have been a good movie IF the director had taken the script more seriously. I'm really glad I didn't buy this movie. I rented it for free at Blockbuster.
3,Old time Limeliter Fan,"Originally bought with the idea in mind that this was an ORIGINAL remastered recording. After initial disappointment, it's not bad and I'd recommend it but don't compare it to the originals as there is no comparison. The voices are fine but the Yarborough lilt, Gottlieb humor and Hasselev banjo just aren't there nor is the comraderie.(Nor for that matter is Yarborough) Having said all this I enjoy it for what it's worth - a new group with an old name and a new presentation and some old gems"
4,But I can see how others might only give it three-stars...,"There are some tacky commercialized third- raters here that I can barely listen to, like ""This Town"", ""When Somebody Loves You"",""Domini"".But there are also three enjoyable rare ones too: ""Something Stupid"" which is no more stupid than any other folk-rock at the time,and better than just about all of them, as well as being Frank and Nancy's best duet,""Softly As I Leave YOU"", with lyrics that have been interpreted to mean the husband is comforting his wife on her death bed (where else is there a song like that?!). And ""The World We Knew"" with lyrics that I can very personally identify with,and a nice arrangement.If only they would have used celloes instead of that annoying fuzz tone in the beginning,but that was the ""in"" sound at the time. If you don't already have ""Summer Wind"",and ""Very Good Year"", this CD is the easiest way to get them too,and they are obvious Frank essentials."
5,Great CD,"I purchased this CD because my school's Celtic Ensemble has been working on Welsh music this semester and we're doing a few of the tunes and songs that happen to be on this album. The music is wonderful, the players are great, and the CD booklet is very useful (and contains all of the texts to the songs). I'm very happy with my purchase."
5,Outstanding!,They should make more TV sitcoms like this nowadays then TV would be worth watching. Good actors and good comedy!
4,This is a BIG compact net! WOW,"Quality of the product overall is fantastic, the size of the net is amazing. However, one down side to this system. The collapsible poles for the net have a bungee cord/shock cord inside them (not the issue)and the caps on each fiberglass pole is made out of a thin metal. My 6 year old son was ""helping"" to clean up and was spinning the metal cap on the end of the pole. This metal cap cut the shock cord and caused the pole to come apart.This is an easy fix but something I wanted to share so nobody else has to fight pushing 30 feet of new shock cord through the poles.Have fun!Randy"
4,A very special film,"Only watch this film if you have experienced a profound sense of loneliness at some point in your life.The storyline isn't anything special, but the STUNNING performances will pull you in. The musical score adds infinite emotion. This film is a small slice of life, and can be a bit too morose for some."
3,Worth viewing.,"Britain is captured here in a very delicate, very introspective way. Three sisters battle depression, loneliness, and disgruntled lives. They are trying to make the best of their world without losing sight of themselves. Michael Winterbottom scores well here in this view of life in the seemingly normal streets of London. In the end, they will tackle the pains of one-night stands, the darkness of trying to find purpose, and the grief of watching a loved-one go AWOL.A good watch if you have time. If not, try something else.*also of note, a great film score helped bring this movie up a few notches."
1,I received the wrong video,"Instead of Michael Winterbottom's Wonderland, as was pictured and reviewed, I received a different Wonderland - a murder mystery about a porn star. It only cost a penny plus $2.99 shipping and the return would cost as much so I am not bothering. But I was disappointed as I sat down to watch my Friday date night movie!"
2,Did not like this one,"I couldn't get past the home-made documentary feel. The lighting, sound, and picture quality sucked big time. The ""faceted hues"" made me sleepy. The characters are boring and I didn't care about them. Too bad, because I really wanted to like this one as I love slice of life movies."
3,gay/lesbian?,why is this movie listed in the gay/lesbian section? there is no gay content in this movie!?
4,Waitress in The Donut Shop,"As good as I remembered it-- and what a guest roster! The title track Sweetheart is mesmorizing and smooth. But my favorite soon became Gringo en Mexico, with a beautiful haunting melody and accompanyment and a real showcase for Muldaur's sultry voice. The whole cd has a very forties jazz feel to it, but there are some favorites that have been made hits by contemporary musicians. She does a great job with Allen Toussant's Brickyard Blues, and adds some grit to her selections with It ain't the Meat it's the Motion. Guests include Kate & Anna McGarrigle, Linda Ronstadt, Paul Butterfield, Mac Rebenack (Dr. John), and more. This CD certainly stands the test of time--and suits the mood of any season. Whether you are curling up with it on a winter afternoon, or feeling the warm summer breezes, you can listen to these tunes over and over and discover more nuances."
4,Some very fine cuts,"Not her best, but a good mix of pop, blues and jazz. See ""Richland Woman Blues"" album for gutsier, more... overall interesting Muldaur cuts. The treatment here of ""Brickyard Blues"" (w what seems to be Dr. John's identifiable piano in back) is great, though - brassy and funky at the same time. There's a fine version of ""It Ain't the Meat It's the Motion,"" and the best ""Travelin' Shoes"" delivery I can recall hearing. I did deduct a star for a couple of clunkers that edge so far away from her best, earthy work they sound intended for elevators and supermarkets right out of the box. But her time with the Jim Kweskin Jug Band does season the music in a lot of places, which, as always, makes her great fun to listen to."
3,A Teen's Point of View,"This is a pretty good book. The ideas in it are original and it's an interesting read, but... I think that three stars is right for it. I don't know, maybe it's something about the characters..."
1,What was I thinking?,"I read this book, because it was there in front of me. Pls do not do it. It is very boring and predictable. You will spend most of your time reading in circles....I gave it 1 star for two reasons, I cannot give it less and it always sent me right to sleep....."
3,"Wild, alright","At least they didn't make Batwoman fly! I wouldn't trust a studio hoist with a budget lower than the continental shelf.I enjoyed watching this drive-in feature which probably never got distributed too many blocks beyond the warehouse....or the Producer's garage. Katherine Victor glides into the various scenes with grace and sexiness - she's probably a tad over 42, but that's cool - for a woman who can fly she's got very well-toned legs...and so do her go-go dancer helpers...in fact if you wanna jump to the final scene, all the femininityreaches critical mass at a pool party. Hip character actor Steve Brodie gets tossed in, to his chagrin, and to the delight of the interns.Brodie is always good: Elvis Presley fans might remember him as Big El's nemesis in another sunny tunefest [this one's not a musical but I always wanted to use that phrase in a review], ""Blue Hawaii"", and about three years later, in ""Roustabout""."
2,I Still Don't Know What Happened...,"I own several episodes of MST3K - including Manos the Hands of Fate, which I think we can all agree is pretty horrid in terms of film making - but The Wild World of Bat Woman may be even worse. I ordered this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend and we were completely perplexed by this incoherent film. The bots didn't have much to work with...and that shows too. Bat Woman runs around in a freaky get up with a bat drawn on her chest and a strange doodad pinned to her bosom communicating with her beach bum bat girls. All the bat girls really like to do is shake it in the sand while listening to weird music. Seriously, is that a song about a rhinoceros? I mean, WHAT IS GOING ON? I recommend this flick to serious MSTies only!"
3,Don't get this unless you are buying it for the bikinis,"Boring. Stupid. The heros (Batwoman and her vampires) are more inept than the horribly inept bad guys (Ratfink and his team). Tom and the robots couldn't seem to come up with much, other than the general agony of being present. The bikinis and their contents are the source of the three stars."
4,How bad can a movie be before MST3K can't even save it?,"If ever a movie was soooooo bad that even MST3K couldn't get me to sit through it, The Wild Wild World of Batwoman would have been the one. Thank heaven for Mike and the 'bots! This was a downright painful film to sit through, but the SOL crew made it all worthwhile!"
1,didn't work,"I ordered a copy of the Wild World of Batwoman from Amazon and doesn't work. When I first got it, it almost played on my DVD/VCR television and it wouldn't play on my PS2. Now it won't play on any DVD player.I want a new one"
1,Possibly the worst movie ever made!,"Imagine giving a scriptwriting job to an 8 year old, and you have the plot for this dud. Batwoman looks like an aging hippie madam to her harem of bikini-clad women. Nothing of any redeeming value whatsoever in this movie. If you absolutely feel you MUST see it, then I suggest getting the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment of it. At least THEY have some fun with it and make it partially bearable (but it still hurts to watch it)"
4,Goofy film...what was the director doing?,"This movie is a wierd, goofy one. Don't attempt to watch it without the MST3K support group. It's intolerably bad. The ""Cheating"" short is a classic one...don't pass this up, but realize it's Mike, b/w, and....lengthy (even though they're all 2 hours, this one seems loooong)."
4,Classic MST,"If you are a MST fan, you will love this one. The movie is terrible - that's why it was selected for MST - and Mike and the bots do a great job of poking fun. It's almost too easy. The only down side is typical of the Rhino videos - Rhino does a terrible job of mixing the audio, so the audio from the movie is very hard to hear, while the audio from Mike and the bots is quite clear. That means you miss the point of some of the jabs. Hopefully, now that Shout Factory has taken the MST videos from Rhino, they will do a better job of audio mix."
3,"Awful, awful movie","There is no way anyone should have let this movie see the light of day. This is one of those MST3K movies that is so bad that not even Mike and the bots can save it. Although, it does have it's funny moments that make this purchase worthwhile. Make sure you're already in a silly mood before watching this one, because if you're looking for this to cheer you up in any way, it isn't going to work. You'll most likely be hunting down the director of The Wild World of Batwoman and demanding two hours of your life back."
5,Amazing new album from Deathstars.,"Deathstars have done it again. They've created another masterpiece. Their first album ""Synthetic Generation"" rocked. Also try the album ""Unsaved"" by Deadstar Assembly."
5,Deathstars CD,"Deathstars' CD ""Termination Bliss"" is one of the best Goth music I have heard. I wish the band ""Deathstars"" a long and successful career."
4,It's a Halloween Book,"The description doesn't say anything about it being a Halloween activity book, called Trick or Scream. It's a good small activity book, had planned to give with my neice/nephews bday cards but guess i will give it to them for Halloween"
4,History and Historians,"This book was very good. I have read a few books on Ireland and this is now one of my favorites. It is not only a good read (how could interesting history not be?!?!), but is also a good reference book to look up facts about Irish history. Particularly interesting were the sections on the various interpretations of Irish history. I didn't realize that people's different ideas about Irish history influenced their political and social opinions so much. At times, though, I thought that maybe historians are too interested in the work of each other. Each chapter has three or four pages on interpretations. This is a good thing, but, if I wasn't interested in the particular topic, I found that I wasn't interested in the interpretations either. But, overall, this is really good history, it seems to me."
1,The author is full of himself,"Although the author is articulate, his ideas are pure nonsense, a blend of pseudo-rational/philosophical musings and New Age gobblety gook dressed up in the name of some long lost Judeo-Christian writings. That does not mean he cannot hold the reader's attention. For dramatic effect, there are, of course, the obligatory evil fundamentalists thrown in. But we've seen all this before.Yawn.I don't know. Maybe it was not as bad as I thought. But at times I just could not get past the arrogance seeping through the author's presentation, as if he were the second coming of God himself spreading the ""Last Gospel"" to the illiterate and intellectually inferior masses.The author is full of himself. After a while, I just couldn't stomach it."
5,PEEL-OFF,GREAT PRODUCT!I COULD SEE A DIFFERENCE IN MY PORES SIZE AND SLIGHTDIFFERENCE IN THE FIRMNESS.PERSONALLY I PREFER PEEL OFF MASKS VS FACE MASKS YOU WASH OFF.JOHNNY GARCIA
4,"Good story, Good book",Good story from the start of life in WVA. all the way to her return to home. Gives a new perspective to what I first thought of what happened.I would recommend this book to all people that show an interest in thye mid east.
3,Kind of weak,This was a kind of weak read. Bragg's sentences were so choppy they gave me a headache trying to read it. I think he was in too much of a hurry. I heard Homer Hickam was the other author Jessica considered. She maybe should have gone with him. He knows West Virginia and has a great writing style.
1,More Media Monopoly War Hype,"Thankfully, this media-created book is bombing. After two days, and after an initial printing of 500,000 copies, it's only #31 on Amazon and #22 on Barnes & Noble. That, in spite of having 14.9 million people watching the NBC Sunday night phoney docudrama, and wall-to-wall guest appearances on the usual media promotion shows. Hopefully, the several hundred thousand unsold copies of Rick Bragg's latest adventure in creative non-fiction will serve a better purpose being recycled than they would have cluttering up folks' bookshelves and brains. The best reviews of this book that I've seen are on stormfront.org."
3,"Tragic Yes, Hero No","While the book chronicles the terrible circumstances surrounding the capture and injury of Jessica it goes too far when categorizing her as a ""hero"". I would not wish what she went through on my worst enemy, but in this instance she was injured while doing a job in which the risks had been identified and communicated.Heroes are ordinary invidividuals who go far above and beyond the call of duty, circumstance, and responsiblity to assist others while ensuring their welfare, Jessica is not a hero but an unfortunate young woman caught up in a terrible web of circumstance. It was an easy read."
1,bleah,"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. Boring. Whoop-de-do. Soldier deploys, soldier captured early in war, soldier part of fake PR rescue mission, soldier turns ""selfless-servce"" into big bucks book rights. Being a speedily written book based only on information supplied by Jessica Lynch, army PAOs, and whatever was available from the wire services, there is no delving into the deeper stories, like ""Why was a supposedly combat ready unit of combat service support personnel lost and so easily attacked?"" (hint-because it was a combat service support unit) or ""What is the truth about the alleged compromising barracks photos?"" or ""Why was this 'rescue' videotaped and then the videotape released to the news media?"" No, this book delves into none of these, rather taking the route of cashing in on some quick bucks before the the American public forgets who she is. There is nothing of substance here, only a made for TV movie."
3,OK but kind of dull,"This is an OK book but considering the subject matter, I found it pretty dull. Bragg went for the easy stuff and bought into the pretty picture Jessica's family fed him. I agree with the below reviewer. Homer Hickam, or some West Virginia writer, should have written this. Bragg just doesn't understand the dark side to Jessica's family and it's staring him right in the face."
5,Fair and Balanced,"With all the spin, I trust Rick Bragg's story. No, she's not a hero (her special op rescuers are), but Jessica put a pretty face (no fault of her own) on the story and we paid attention."
1,NOT a Hero..... Never,A disgrace. Lynch is safe at home making money while others are dying on the battle field. This story is written in an overly dramatic tone and reads more like fiction. It appears that incidents are included for drama rather than the truth. Some of the run-on sentences don't fit well. Not a good read.
1,Fiction dressed as fact,"Jessica Lynch is desperate to cash in on her ten minutes of fame. So, now she's claiming she was raped - although she has no memory of it - and in spite doctor's reports that say there were no signs of sexual assault. I'm just waiting for her next book, ""I Was Abducted By Aliens, Too""."
1,I wouldnt read a book about her,"I wouldnt buy a book about one soldier that was in war, but i would buy a book that had stories about all pow's that was in Iraq. She isnt any more special than the other pow's. Its real sad to see that America thinks she's an icon when people in the war have died. What about them they deserve to be respected more by media and across this nation. I have respect for all the soldiers that have fought for this great country."
1,Not a good read,A nice person I'm sure but what a shame to make such a fuss about a soldier who couldn't even fire back because her gun had jammed. Not a good advertisement for a soldier. I feel sorry that she has put herself out in the public eye so that she can be judged. Not a well written book. Certainly not Bragg's best.
