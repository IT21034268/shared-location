2,Not the best book for research,This book is not very good. I am disappointed in the research done for this book and I find her idea that the German's spread the disease as propaganda. She does little to back up this idea. It does not flow well and I found to her thoughts to be disorganized. You might be better off finding another book to read on this amazing story of the Spanish flu.
3,"not bad, but","rather superficial. Some good background and character sketches on some of the people involved in the scientific community and the book does bring some of the human side to science. One is bothering; Cyril Wecht, the Allegheny county coroner who played a key role in the 1976 immunization story is identified in the book as ""Cyril Wright"". We can hope this was an editor's/copy reader's error, but that's the kind of thing that can undermine the thrust of any nonfiction work. I mean, if the writer makes this sort of elementary error, how careful has the research been....Overall though, I would recommend the book; it's fairly well written and a quick read."
4,A fascinating Story,"Good historical information, many interesting biographical sketches, and stories about the flu of 1918. The worst epidemic in world history. (and the least talked about.)The disease came and went in a flash and ultimately led to many medical breakthroughs.This is a good overview of the subject and fairly fast read. Enjoyable."
2,Don't waste your time,"There are better books on the subject. This is written to turn a historical matter into a detective story. If you're going to do that then have a resolution. The build up for this story, which goes from Alaska to Norway to Hong Kong, leads nowhere. In the end, the author has some speculation on what caused the disease but nothing in the least bit concrete. There are hundreds of pages spent on the search for a frozen but living virus that leads to it being mapped. Does it tell us anything about the virus. Not really. If I need speculation I'll read John Case. That has the same story in a fiction novel with much of the same speculation.Meanwhile she tells us very little about the virus. A chapter is spent on what happened in 1918. That's it. Read Crosby's book. Everyone else mentioned in this did."
1,amazingly superficial and disappointing,"In this book she covers what seems the entire history of influenza, which includes the greatest pandemic in history in 1918-1919, the swine flu scare in 1976-- she even goes into litigation over the vaccine-- attempts to dig up bodies killed by the 1918 virus and sequence its genome, none of it in depth. In all of the footnotes for this book, there is not a single one for a primary source regarding the pandemic itself. No diaries, no lab notes, no original letters. There's hardly a reference to a contemporary newspaper. In fact, her notes cite interviews with a historian who wrote about the pandemic. Gina Kolata is a reporter, and this is a glorified newspaper story, expanded. Too bad. The subject itself is of interest."
2,Interesting but shallow.,"I found this book to be disappointing.Given the rich material at the heart of the flu story (molecular biology, genetics, virology) I had hoped that this science would, albeit at a layman's level, be the center of the story. Instead the book is largely a collection of anecdotes about a subset of those who tried to reconstruct the virus. Such material could better have been dealt with, more briefly, in (for example) a New Yorker magazine article.One exception - the last 10 pages describe some of the scientist's insights into how this virus might have become so lethal. The too-brief discussion of these theories provides the reader with some food for thought. It is ashame that the author included so little material of this type.Summary - if your interest is with the people involved in this detective work, this book is worth a read. If your interest is in the underlying science this book will likely disappoint you."
2,Very disappointing - poorly written book,"I was so disappointed by this book that I'm actually writing a review here! This book feels like it was written in great haste. Kolata fails to find or depict compelling conflicts, personalities or science... and her writing comes close to being excruciating! For a great piece of recent science writing check out the _Baltimore Case_ instead."
4,Fascinating and Timely,"Gina Kolata's ""Flu"" is a concise book packed with information about the 1918 flu pandemic, later efforts to study the virus by finding preserved samples of the virus, and the chances of such a virus spreading again. Kolata vividly relates the tragic toll of the virus in the midst of an already devastating World War. Her description of the controversial decision to try to obtain preserved specimens of flu infected tissue from the arctic may be the most gripping part of the book - it's a well told real life adventure with real consequences. Finally Kolata moves to a disturbing but timely discussion of later outbreaks of the virus, and the implications they hold for another outbreak of the magnitude of the 1918 tragedy. This is a disturbing but important and informative work, as well as a fascinating read."
2,"interesting material, lame writing","she should stick to writing for magazines and newspapers because her style of writing becomes tedious when streched out to the length of the book..i became interested in the influenza epidemic of 1918 after coming a reference of it in one of william oneil's books..i wanted to read more about an event that killed more people than either world wars..if i had to pick a book on the subject again, i think i would try Alfred Crosby's book on the subject..now, there's a real historian as opposed to a reporter trying to write books"
4,A chilling -- and true -- story,I thought the book was fascinating. I wish the author had spent more time describing the effect of the 1918 flu on American society -- most of the book deals with the search for the virus that caused the flu -- but it is nonetheless a fascinating and frightening book.
2,"mediocre extended newspaper article, now dated","This is not a book about 1918. This is an over-hyped and overlong newspaper story about digging up bodies and trying to recover the 1918 virus from them. It's now (June 2004) much dated, which is what happens to newspaper stories.If you want to read an actual book about the epidemic-- and about much more, including contemporary science, the virus, the interplay between politics and the disease-- then read The Great Influenza by Barry. Now THAT is worth picking up. I gave that 5 stars, and if I could give it more I would."
3,"A good story, poorly written","The subject matter is fascinating, and Kolata makes the topic very understandable by non-medical readers. But she overall does not write the story very well. She skips erratically backwards and forwards in time so frequently I was often left not knowing what year it was. And though she makes an effort to string compelling details through the plot, she does an awkward job of tying up those strings toward the end. I was left unsure of how it ended, and what was discovered vs. unknown, leaving with a sense of a mystery half-solved.I certainly have gained a much stronger understanding of the influenza virus and a greater respect for pathology through this reading."
5,A very compelling read,"This book reads like a work of fiction, but every word is fact. The story of the devastation of the 1918 Influenza Pandemic and the subsequent decades-long search for the virus that caused it will frighten even the most jaded among us. That this deadly virus could one day return and kill hundreds of millions makes most other potential disasters pale by comparison. Gina Kolata tells the story with skill. Everyone needs to read this book."
1,i was not impressed,"The subject is fascinating, yes, but Gina Kolata did not do justice either to the history or to current science. (Incidentally, several reviewers in here have given her credit for writing The New Yorker article on digging up bodies; she did NOT write that article. Malcom Gladwell did.) In terms of the more distant history, she was superficial at best. Barely 25% of the book deals with the 1918 pandemic. In terms of her analysis even of the 1976 swine flu fiasco, she shows herselt to be a political naif. In terms of the writing, overwrought newspaperish journalism. The best part of the book, and even that is only decent, covers Jeff Taubenburg's work sequencing the genome, which he pulled off a pathology slide.Hopefully this book will not deter a good writer from addressing the same subject."
3,"Some good, some not","Here's the problem: the horrendous 1918 flu pandemic is a fascinating story, and so is the search for the virus that continues to this day. That material starts and ends the book.But there's a bunch of other stuff in the middle that's a lot less interesting, like the chapters on the swine flu of 1976 and the Hong Kong flu. Although these are important stories, and tangentially related to the main story, these chapters are flat and dull by comparison, filled with the droning of various government bureaucrats, and as a result, the book flounders in the middle.This book cries out to be revised as research into the 1918 virus yields more information. It's not the author's fault that the mystery remains murky, but it leaves the reader with a feeling of a job not completed, that perhaps the book was written too soon."
1,Beginning to see what is lacking in NYT science coverage,"While the book is an interesting read, Gina Kolata, a science reporter for the NYT, unfortunately mischaracterizes some of the science as well as an excessive number of historical events. Ms Kolata also spends so much time on trivia (such as the details of the swine flu litigataion) and so ends the book too quickly. The book also could have used better editing -- people are frequently referred to before being introduced, and a few (like the obese Alaskan woman) are never introduced at all. If I were Dr. Duncan, btw, I wouldn't appreciate being depected a an bimbo, but I think Kolata managed to avoid libel by only citing other peoples quotes.I'm not sure that I gained new knowledge by reading this book, but I am sure its going to be sold to the used bookstore next week."
4,Flu,"Despite its wordy title, _Flu: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the Search for the Virus that Caused It_, is an extremely accessible and thoroughly compelling text. _Flu_ weaves the science, politics, history, and personal tragedy of epidemiology into a thriller that is impossible to put down. The storytelling is made all the more rich by the depth and accuracy of the research.Gina Kolata has distilled into one book the bulk of recent popular examinations of the 1918 influenza pandemic. More importantly, though, she has made the impact of the pandemic relevant by linking it to events in our own time. The result is the elevation of a nearly forgotten period to the status of one of the most important events of the twentieth century.The perfect ""Get Well"" gift!"
4,Not what I expected,"When I first heard about this book, I assumed that it was a fairly straightforward retelling of the story of the 1918 flu pandemic, so I ordered it. I was surprised, upon reading it, to discover that only a very small part of the book discussed the 1918 outbreak; the majority of it concerned the scientific search for the cause of the killer virus. It is a fascinating tale, even if it's not the reason I purchased the book. Occasionally, the scientific language caused my eyes to glaze over, but I still found it interesting. My older daughter, a science grad from MIT who is doing Phd work in neurobiology at Harvard, told me she wants to read this book. I think she'll understand a lot more of it than I did!"
3,it's.... ok.,"I'm amused by the one reviewer who gave this book 5 stars, and who starts out by citing Gina Kolata's article in the The New Yorker. That was indeed an excellent article. But Gina Kolata didn't write it. The reviewer's judgment is about as reliable as his or her facts. 5 stars? What are you smoking? the other reviewers are generally correct: the book is superficial, does not spend sufficient time on the 1918 pandemic itself (for example, here in Memphis I believe-- don't quote me-- it led to the founding of St. Jude's Hospital, now a major research center), and does do a fairly good job on current science. By no means is this a superb book, but it's... ok."
1,read Crosby's book on this subject instead,"If you actually want to know about events in 1918, especially in the US, read Crosby's book (see link below), whom Kolata interviewed and cites as a source. It's a far better effort not only in terms of research but in depth and understanding. Kolata does do one thing Crosby doesn't: she relates events that are going on now in terms of finding samples of the virus and sequencing its genome. But since those invetsigations are still on-going, and since the crucial question about this virus remains unanswered-- i.e., why was it so much more deadly than other influenza viruses?-- Kolata can't provide satisfaction anyway, and a review of current work (which will soon be dated) is not enough to justify buying this derivative and superficial overblown newspaper story."
2,Historically flawed with little insight into the basics.,"You will get a lively tale including plenty of irrelevant journalistic chit-chat. But you will not understand why flu is a menace. The flu virus is so dangerous because it can undergo sudden and profound shifts in its makeup, rendering existing vaccines ineffective. These shifts occur by high frequency exchange and rearrangement of viral gene segments, a mechanism that was first suggested by F. M. Burnet and described by George Hirst. Burnet and Hirst were pioneers and giants in the influenza virus field. They are not even mentioned in this book. More balanced history could have made a far more insightful story."
4,Excellent medical history book for the non-initiated,"As a professor of epidemiology and health research and an avid reader of medical thrillers (fiction and non-fiction), I was pleased to read Kolata's book on the 1918 flu epidemic and the subsequent work on flu research. I have also read Crosby's and Collier's books, both extremely well researched accounts of the 1918 epidemic. Kolata's book was different in that she produced a story that was compelling yet always understandable, especially in her descriptions of complicated scientific procedures. No prior knowledge of epidemiology or molecular biology is needed to enjoy the story being presented. Some of my scientific colleagues may fault Kolata for her ""People"" style of writing, but I found the book to be an engaging, easy read about a topic which most people know little."
2,A Book Searching for a Story,"""Flu"" is a quick, easy, read that skims over the 1918 Pandemic and introduces the reader to the current science of influenza.What I am most greatful for is the book's introducing me to Crosby's ""America's Forgotten Pandemic"".However, the book draws no solid conclusions, and has no real ending. It also leaves threads hanging at the conclusion. (We are never told from what virus strain (H?N?) the recovered RNA indicated the 1918 flu belonged. Finally, the chatty biographies of the books personalities were really annoying to have to wade through. (Does it really matter that Kirsty Duncan does Celtic dancing?)Pass this up and go straight to ""America's Forgotten Pandemic""."
3,Not what I had hoped it would be,"The Great Influenza Epidemic of 1918 was one of histories greatest plagues, killing an estimated 25 million world wide - yet little has been written about it. I had hoped Kolata's book would shed more light on the subject. I was disappointed. Instead of discussing the pandemic itself, I discovered the book was more of a documentary on two scientists competing for a sample of the flu virus - one searcing in Alaska, the other in nether reaches of Norway.To liven the book up, Kolata spends an extraordinary amount of time contrasting the expeditions, which could not be more different in their approach to the subject: one is a lone epidemiologist working on a shoe string budget, the other working with a team of scientists with monied sponsorship. But this is not why I purchased the book. If you are more interested in the story of the disease itself, I recommend Alfred Crosby's America's Forgotten Pandemic. If not, you may find this book worthwhile."
1,This book is quite a mess,"You get the sense, after reading this book, that when Gina Kolata felt she had enough material to fill a three hundred page book, she just transcribed her index cards and let it go at that. The book is all over the place. It is cluttered, repetitious and badly written.The great flu epidemic of 1918 should be an interesting topic in the hands of the right writer. Someone who knows more about writing than I do will have to explain what it is about Kolata's writing style that makes it close to unbearable. Not just bad--unbearable!"
1,A very disappointing book,"I purchased this book based on a radio interview with the author. The subject matter was fascinating to me. Unfortunately, the book was not. Having read some great authors (Stephen Ambrose for one), this book came across as shallow, hastily written, pulpy (a lot of filler), aimless, etc. It is the first time that I have felt compelled to write a negative review. I would definitely not recommend that anyone purchase this book. If you are curious, check it out at the library, and then be thankful that you did not buy it."
2,Meandering,"This book reads like an over long movie. The plot is good, the characters interesting, but of the 306 pages in this book, a good 150 to 200 could have been excised. They relate at most only tangentially to the 1918 flu epidemic. The reader really needs to work at finding and keeping the focus. Perhaps a better title would have been Flu: a stream of consciousness essay on the Swine Flu of 1976, John Dalton and color blindness and by the way, the 1918 Flu pandemic. Disappointing."
2,Not that good,"I am a full time Mechanical Engineer, father and grad student going for my Master's degree. I don't have alot of time on front of a fireplace to read. When I bought this book I wanted a rundown of the pandemic and history involved. This book delivers that but I had to weed it out painstakingly. This book mostly gives biographies of the scientists and pathologists who researched the virus with a bit of info given on the actual subject of the book weaved into it. I constantly found myself skipping dozens of pages to get the the subject of the book. This one may end up on Ebay for whatever I can get for it."
5,Nora The Piano Playing Cat,"I enjoyed the'video of Nora playing her style of piano. Very amusing how she would ""play"" a note on the piano,and the other cat would strike the keys or hammers to get Nora's attention. One has to realize this is not a Hollywood clip, just an ordinary cat doing performing as cats do."
4,I like my copyholder!,"I like this swingarm copy holder very much. I don't do a lot of typing so i just needed something small. It sticks to the computer so I never have to remember where i put it, and it swings flat out of my way when i'm not using it. I am pleased with this product. Thanx!"
2,Doesn't stick,"This item had the exact specifications that I was looking for. However, it does not stick well to the monitor. I had it up only 3 days before it began falling off and it will not stay on at all now. I will have to turn to gorilla glue if I want to use this product, which unfortunately will permanently mark my monitor."
2,Bratz Election 3rd Grade - More like 1st Grade,I bought this for my 1st Grader thinking she would be challenged for some time to come. With in two hours she had mastered all programs and wanted another Leap Pad Book. This was not 3rd Grade level from our standpoint. Very disappointed in the content.
3,"""If I'd had more time, I'd have written a shorter book.""","Had this book been less than half its size readers would end up learning much more about the Maya from it. Unfortunately, there's much too much that belongs in an Archeology 101 class here and by the time you get to some discussion of the Maya, you're half asleep. Those of us who are not reading archeology for the first time will wish the author had just kept his discussion to the Maya, as the title suggests he will, and assumed we understood the basics.Personally, I'm still looking for a book on the Maya so that as I travel from site to site in Quintanaroo, Yucatan, Guatemala and Honduras, I will have a basic understanding of the site I'm driving to. I just booked a trip that will book me in the area of Chac Mool soon. I'll see what I can find."
4,"Odd reason to buy, but I stick to it.","The only reason I bought this version is because it has the best Pickering. Those quick stacatto string orchestrations behind the words ""YOOOooooouuuuuuu...DID IT!!!"" are my favorite. But every other version makes me cringe because the Pickerings in those versions aren't anywhere in the relm of hitting the right pitches. At least this Michael Denison comes close to the right notes and doesn't distract me too much from enjoying the strings. I know, I know, silly reason to most people, but I REALLY like that song and I'd like the melodic line to be SUNG CORRECTLY."
5,True-life tales about emotional attachments and loving relationships formed within libraries and the library field,"The Romance Of Libraries is a delightful anthology of true-life tales about emotional attachments and loving relationships formed within libraries and the library field. Grouped loosely by context, the stories range from happy to sad to a mixture of joy and sorrow, and include tales of reading room romance, bookmobile romance, library school romance, library cupids, and more. Offering a vital message that physical libraries are a crucial, community building block in a manner that virtual libraries cannot duplicate, The Romance Of Libraries is both lighthearted and an intensely satisfying collection of love stories."
2,We returned it for aesthetic reasons,"Not the fault of the vendor or manufacturere but, for my girlfriend, the watch was too large and bulky to suit her. By the way, it was delivered in two days."
2,Don't be fooled by the pretty cover...,"The cover looks professional and promising, but the actual content is little more than elevator music.Some of the tracks are interesting and fresh, but most of the music is repetitive, unoriginal, and B-O-R-I-N-G. Jazz is supposed to sound improvisational, but this sounds like a bunch of pre-recorded fool-arounds on a keyboard. Yes, keyboard. There are maybe three real instruments used to record the CD.I understand that this album is part of a whole series of Jazz music for different moods and times of the day, but I haven't heard any of them. Perhaps those were a little more successful than this one.But all in all, I'm surprised they came up with enough material for two discs."
4,Hope for Rain,"I purchased this at the mall one day, motivated purely by the title and cover of this CD. Somehow I knew it would live up to my expectations, and it did. The photo of an attractive girl wandering through an empty parking lot, wearing barely anything on a misty, rainy summer afternoon evokes endless images, which the music caters to.The jazz tracks are light, reflective, slow, and easy. They are best listened to in solitude. Eleven long-playing tracks - you get a lot for your money. After listening to this album, you may even be inspired to take a walk like the woman on the cover. She is also on the CD itself - like I said, a very attractively designed CD package.The title would have been too long, but it would not have been wrong to call it Jazz for a Rainy, Summer Afternoon."
5,Disappointed,"I bought this awhile back( like 2 years ago). I actually bought a cd, but when it came, it was a cassette. I never returned because 1) returns are a complete hassle!!! and 2) I can still play it on my tape deck. If I purchase this product again, I want the cd!!!from someone who is ticked off!!"
5,Soothing,"I have this CD and have used is as gifts and play at dinner parties and folks who are not jazz listeners want to know what, who, etc. They love it. Put this on and curl up with a good book, cup of coffee and a fire in the fireplace and you have a perfect afternoon."
1,THIS SHOULD BE MUSIC AT A LUAU!,"I would like to complain. This is NOT jazz for a ""rainy day"" this is junk for a freakin Hawaiian dance party. I feel like I should be eating roasted pig with the music. GIVE ME A BREAK. HAWAII SHOULD'T EVEN BE A PART OF THE USA!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Soft jazz for many occasions.,"This series has found a good marketing niche by naming separate moods for each of its CDs. But the music it contains is very, very good- at home in the rain, while falling asleep, or as a soundtrack to a slow dance with a lover.Try some of the audio samples! Whatever mood it inspires in you, whether lonely and contemplative as the title suggests or slow-burn romantic as many have found, you will enjoy this CD."
4,Ultrasonic Cleaner,"I have had this item for about a month. I am very satisfied with the finished result when cleaning my jewelry. I put a drop of dishwashing liquid in along with tap water and the jewelry sparkles. I also like the heat feature, which I have used each time. My only complaint is the ""off"" button doesn't seem to work. Rather, I have to unplug the unit after cleaning.Overall, great product."
3,170 WATT Ultrasonic Cleaner w Heater,I used the product once I was not impressed. Turned around and sold it on Ebay. Too big for what I needed for home use. I am sure someone with a business will be very happy with the product.
3,It's a little flaky,"Admittedly, this thing did a fairly good job of cleaning all the items I put into it. I gave it 3 stars because the button for turning the heating feature on and off doesn't seem to make a lick of difference. Once you hit the button and the heating element is activated, pressing the button again doesn't actually turn the heating element off. I have to unplug it every time I'm done using it, and well... that sucks. Not to mention the maximum timer length is way too short... I really don't like having to manually run the unit several times."
4,170 Watt 2 Liter Ultrasonic cleaner,"Gave this cleaner to my wife as a gift (she had indicated that she wanted a jewelry cleaner). It has worked well on various pieces of jewelry, silverware, etc and she is pleased."
2,Item not as described,Ordered this because it was the 3.53 ounce container. Future City Plus sent me the 3.0 ounce one instead.
5,"SOME OF THE SMOOTHEST, FUNKEYEST KEYBOARDS YET!!","I BOUGHT THIS DISK A FEW MONTHS BACK AND IT QUICKLY BECAME ONE OF MY FAVORITES! ""GROOVE"" IS THE RIGHT WORD FOR THIS MAN THESE KEYS WILL HELP ANY BOUND-UP RYTHEM-FREE JOE GET A ""GROOVE"" ON!"
2,Tiresome and disappointing,"From the reviews and description I was expecting so much more. So much of the narrative felt forced and self-indulgent. I wish an editor had come when Clegg called. It relied a lot on graphic shock value as a horror device and the protagonist's tortured psyches instead of real character development. Comparisons to King would only be appropriate if Cujo or Pet Sematary was your favorite of his books. I love Peter Straub, and a lot of King's work. I thought this might be similar but it's not. I didn't like it, but you can't fight city hall, it seems almost everyone else did!"
2,Major Disappointment,"I had wanted to read Clegg for quite some time, but did not know where to begin (I believed that many of his books are of a series). I emailed the Clegg website to ask if they could recommend a book but never heard back from them. I found a copy of You Come When I Call You and thought it would be a good primer for later Clegg books. Instead, all I experienced with this book was disappointment--so much so in fact, that I could not bring myself to even finish it.Clegg continuously leaps back and forth from past to present, from dream to reality; this begins to annoy about a third of the way in. The intertwining of different storylines gets a bit complex as characters are sprinkled into the mix along the way.I believed the story to have potential after the first few chapters, but it failed to keep me interested after about the half-way point. I do not recommend this book. I hope that Clegg's other offerings are better."
2,No Peter Straub,"I was expecting a lot from this book, after all Clegg has been compared with Straub and King. Maybe I was expecting too much because this is a seriously disapponting read. The plot is confusing, the narrative all over the place and crucially it's not scary at all."
2,Not very exciting,"I guess I just expected too much from Cleeg. The story was a challenge to read all the way through, without much payoff at the end."
3,WRONG NUMBER/You Come When I Call,"I expected to enter a world of paranormal activity, scary ghosts and evil forces. Although this book ""seems"" to go to these places, it comes up very short. The visions shared by the teenage victims, now adults, are repetitious and fill up far too many pages. The villainess never seems real enough. Most of the characters are not fleshed out for that matter. The two old ladies toward the end (Queenie and the Bording Room lady) are interesting and save a few chapters with their endearing qualities. Despite these shortcomings and an extremely slooooooow middle, I was interested enough to finish the book. This was a bubble gum version of the kind of writing Clive Barker produces. I've read worse, and, of course, much better."
2,Tiresome dream sequences pad a lean plot,"First of all this is the first novel by Clegg I have read and I think he is a talented, visceral writer and will seek out his other works. But this novel seemed heavy-handed and frustratingly murky in content. Great, sordid trailerpark characters...way too much dreaming & illusions that slow the story down..bad editing here I look forward to whatever else you write, Doug.."
5,A Page Turner,"A true page turner from the get go. A riveting story, and deftly crafted characters brings YOU COME WHEN I CALL YOU to life right there in your hands. I promise, you will not be able to put this book down!"
5,Excellent read from Douglas Clegg,"A group of friends experience a horror at young age which they carry with them all their lives, only to return to its origin and face it once more. Douglas Clegg is a original, great horror writer and this novel doesn't disappoint. He gets better with each book and is simply one ofthe most under-rated talents out there. As King got boring over the past years, Clegg became much better."
2,Shallow and repetitious,"I expected so much more than the re-done and over-done blood and guts that fills this book. The best part was the two older women in the boarding house. They are described well and in detail where the other characters just come up short. This is a sci-fi/alien invading plot that focused on one town out west. The children involved live to their adulthood plagued by the horrors they saw one summer. Now the alien is back to finish what she started. If you can make it through the first half, (that's a big IF), the second half is a bit more interesting. Good Luck if you give this book a chance. I would not read it again and I wish I never read it the first time."
3,"A good story, but I was expecting more...","A very good novel, but just that.Good.I was expecting more from Clegg. And I don't know how to quantify that. More. The book was ok, but it seemed to bog down at times. It didn't move as smoothly as some of his other novels.Still anything he writes is better than a lot of other stuff passing as horror fiction these days. A very capable writer who knows how to scare [...] people."
3,A lot like King!,"This book has been compared to King's It and I agree - the ending falls short like much (if not all) of King's work.Over all it was a great book, but I felt the ending was predictable and didn't have the ""oomph"" it should have had. The story was told well and Clegg did a great job of bouncing back & forth between times and places. I also like how he didn't ""dumb down"" the happenings; he let the reader piece a lot of the story together themselves.Clegg is a promising writer and I will definately read more of his stuff."
1,Please dont come any more Mr Clegg,"This book was terrible. It lacked narrative, there was no real reason for any of the protagonists moves and it was poorly written.I read a lot of books, 60-70 per year and I have no doubt that this was the worst book I have read in the past 5 years. Do yourself a favour and avoid this book as if it was a demon."
3,Think Exorcist Meets It,"This is quite a chilling tale, told rather effectively. A demon stopped by children and haunts them as adults may sound like an easy comparison to Stephen King's IT, but thats where it stops. Douglas gets more gruesome here, drawing you in slowly into these four kids lives then and now, weaving a tight web around you without you even noticing until you can't put the book down, you have to learn what the ""awful thing"" they did was. This is my first venture into Clegg's work and I daresay, not my last. Douglas, you have made me a fan."
5,Best Clegg Book,"Well this is the third book of Douglas Cleggs' that i have read, and I'll have to admit, it is the best. I first read Nightmare Chroicles, then Halloween Man, but You come when I call You was very impressive. Clegg is a wonderful author, with such a huge imagination. He uses such imagery that you feel as though you are right their with the characters. I love how he switches from present to the past, but it flows so nicely together so it is easy to understand. I anticipate going out to get a new Clegg book every chance I get."
4,Star Wars Waterslide,"My boys, 5 and 9 years, love this waterslide. The pool of water at the end is a big splash with them! The only negative thing about it is that it tears easily if too much strain is put on it. Other than that, it's a great item!"
3,Coulda went smoother....,"I was very excited when i found this Lp at my local record store since ive always been curious since i heard them featured on Gangstarr's Lp's.I always liked the way they flowed but they just didnt bring it like i thought they would.They just didnt stamp the Lp with any memorable songs or Anthems. Now dont write me off as some commercial, Top 40 doushe, because that couldnt be farther from the truth.I just dont think they lived up to bar they set for themselves."
5,this song rocks,"the song #4 is the best song i have ever heard in my life. i had it taped and then i lost it, and i almost cried, then one day i heard some kid listening to it and he said it was by nice and smooth so i ran to here and ordered the CD i cant wait to get it!!!!!@"
4,Nice & Smooth -- Ain't A Damn Thing Changed,"Released back in 1991, this was an underrated debut album from the duo known as Nice & Smooth. The two offer some of the most creative hip-hop of all-time, especially with songs like ""Hip-Hop Junkies"". Of course, most people have never heard anything like the voice of Greg Nice, but that's the beauty of this album. Peace"
5,Great Book,"This is the best gardening book I have ever owned! It is very informative, easy to follow, & has great pics!"
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"I was looking for a book on Bulldogs that would explain better the differences between male and female. If you bought a female what to expect when she went into heat. It doesn't even touch on those subjects. Mainly talks about puppies, training, food things most people should already know when buying a puppy. Very disappointed in this book, don't waste your money."
2,Disappointing!,It's just o.k. I was very disappointed in the food section... Very general information. Did not mention the fact that bulldogs have various allergies and should be fed a gluten-free diet. look elsewhere if you're looking for in-depth information.
3,bulldog information,Good service. Book was good but have gotten ones from other authors that were full of more information.
4,Cool Spinning Top,I really loved this top. It was both functional and somewhat nostaligic. I was also happy with the shipping time and the item was exactly as stated.Made a great Christmas present for my 3 year old grandson.
4,A Must Read!,"Project BTB is a great Techno-thriller. Mr. Ross did an excellent job writing this book. The book is full of twists and turns. Right when you think you have it figured out, Mr. Ross throws in another piece of the puzzle. People who enjoy techno-thriller's should definitely not miss this one."
3,Not as pictured,I choose this battery because it was a Maxell and was not made in China. But when it arrived the Maxell name was not on the battery or the packaging. It looks just like the one I purchased pryor to this and would not hold a charge after 2 months. So far this one is holding a charge and it has been several months.
5,Fascinating movie with a great cast,"Although we can now be almost certain, due to DNA tests, that Anna Anderson was not the real Anastasia, the story is still fascinating. And there is more to it than whether she was Anastasia or not. It's the story about a person looking for her identity (and I'm sure she believed she was Anastasia) and the story of how people react to her claims.30 years before this TV movie was made, Ingrid Bergman won an Oscar playing the same character. It's beyond me how Amy Irving didn't win an Emmy for her performance. It is acting at its best. She was nominated for a Golden Globe but didn't win. Jan Niklas, in my opinion giving one of the weaker performances, won a Golden Globe. Irving also gets great help from several legendary actors. Rex Harrison, in his last performance, is the best of the supporting actors.I can be impatient sometimes and don't usually watch movies this long, but ""Anastasia"" kept my interest non-stop for over three hours. Don't miss it."
5,Wonderful!,"I love history and I was ALWAYS fascinated by Anastasia and her family. Her life broke my heart. I just can't fathom to think how those monsters could shoot kids. But anyways, I ENJOYED and LOVED this movie. Even I was hoping this Anna Anderson was truly Anastasia, I always wished at least someone had survived that horrible shooting.Anyways wonderful WONDERFUL movie. The actress who played Anna was wonderful. This movie is so good. I recommend it to anyone ESPECIALLY to those who love history and were interested in this time about the Czar and his family."
4,Anastasia,Wasn't expecting it to be a great movie because of a book I read once on Anastasia but actually really enjoyed watching it.
2,I good Begining,"I liked this movie at the begining. I thought the director did a good job with creating likeable charaters, however I was very disappointed with the ending. I wouldn't recommend this movie."
2,Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna DVD Review,"This is a well-made film, but I must say that the picture on the DVD is of below-average quality--hence my two-star rating. It is unfortunate that numerous made-for-TV and independent films fall into the hands of companies that don't have any regards for quality."
4,great quiet toy,"We take these woodkins to church with us to keep our girls occupied and they are great. So great, in fact, that sometimes they draw the attention of folks around us. Not uncommon for a man to pick it up and make a few outfits. Darling toy and makes a great gift."
2,Don't judge this book by its cover,"I must say, I was quite disappointed by this book. There's way too much psychoanalysis and far too little historical info. Personally, I'm not interested in Mr. Asher's lay-psychology. I read the book hoping to find detailed biographical and historical info. What I got instead was a poorly written psychological analysis written by an amateur."
3,Psychological Study of TE Lawrence,"This book is most certainly an easy read. Asher whets your appetite by giving a different perspective from other Lawrence biographies. He follows in Lawrence's footsteps to historically significant spots and gives an eyewitness account of varing desert terrains with a pleasant nostalgia. However, instead of pursuing that route he turns to psychological interpretations of Lawrence's personality that are not supported, but merely purported. Overall this is not a definitive biography of Lawrence."
3,A Good Introduction,"I am by no means a Lawrence scholar. I picked the book up at a discount because at the time I was preparing for a deployment to Iraq and was reading everything I could on the recent history of the Middle East. I found the book well written and fascinating. Historicaly accurate? Who knows? But it was a great introduction to a Western icon closely tied with the rise of the Saudi kingdom and the current map of the Middle East. After reading this I read Lawrence's own ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"" and who knows what the absolute truth was regarding Lawrence and his exploits. All I know is that this book made for a good reading. I appreciated Asher's insights into Arabic culture and customs. Certainly as we struggle to win the ""hearts and minds"" of the people in Iraq, any scholarship that helps us to understand how a Westerner can succesfully interact with the Arab peaple is a welcome read."
2,A good story badly told,"Readers hoping for a good read about Lawrence will be sadly disappointed.This is an interesting story badly told. Mr Asher keeps interrupting his narrative by persistent psychoanalysis of Lawrence as well as stories of his own exploits in the footsteps of his subject. Such comments rightfully belong in the footnotes and appendixes. Putting them in the main body makes this a cumbersome work.The book should be more aptly titled Psychoanalysing Lawrence. Then at least the reader will know what he is in for. For those who just want a good read of Lawrence of Arabia, warts and all, this is not the book."
5,A great book,"This book is a great place to start, or if you already have that is okay, in warmwater fly-fishing. The information is very helpful. A must for the angler who can't go to the trout stream every weekend and a local lake is much closer."
4,"DIALOGUE IS CUT, BUT IT'S WELL WORTH HEARING","While not my recommendation for a sole recording of this great opera, I can certainly recommend it for the superb singing of Schwarzkopf, Seefried, Jurinac, Kunz, and London, etc. All are youthful, accurate, and very fresh. The ladies are especially wonderful to hear. Von Karajan's pacing is very fast, probably too fast, which is very unusual for him. The dialogue is cut, which means that one musical number goes right into the next, which makes one think they are listening to a highlights version. The price is incredibly cheap, many dollars less expensive than the Great Recordings of the Century version also available. If you want to hear some great Mozart singing, and are willing to approach this recording as one would have in 1951, then you will probably enjoy this version."
2,More studio talk in front of many tracks.,"I bought this CD in the hope that it would contain the songs without any countoffs or talk before the songs. I already had that garbage on the Legendary Masters CD.This CD is ruined in the same way, most of the hits have worthless talk before the music.Whose idea is this? Who thinks people want this?Does anyone know of a CD that has the music and nothing but the music with clean cues."
2,Beware! Re-Mixes and Alternate Versions,"A lot of the tracks are re-mixed and don't sound much like the original versions, and ""Sure Gonna Miss Her"" sounds nothing like the hit you know. The band's covers of other singers' tunes aren't worth your time, so although you get 31 songs overall, only a couple are any good. Buy the ""greatest hits"" CD instead."
4,"Decent poster, but the picture is not the clearest.",This is a good poster for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but not the best. I bought it to replace an old one that had some tears and tac holes. It should be noted that the poster advertised above has a clearer picture then the poster I received and is most likely a reproduction of the original. A decent poster but I'm still going to keep my old one.
2,"Good, but far from great. And there are two other recordings of this works which are far superior.","Without a doubt the finest version of Fantasia On Christmas Carols is found on 1993 Hyperion recording conducted by Mathew Best. And the Wilcox version of Hodie done in the 60s, while sonically inferior is still the gold standard for this lovely and underrated piece. There are also numerous other versions of the Fantasy out there which are good and can be had for a low price. The treatment of both pieces here is solid, but I think there are better ones to be found."
4,A Proper Mix...Finally!,"The U.K. release of ""It Feels So Good"" delivers the first DJ-friendly, club-worthy mix of this hit so far. The Can 7 mix is pretty much a general house mix, not bad but not too interesting either. It's the Conductor & The Cowboy mix which propels this song into euphoria. It clocks in at almost 9 minutes, and takes the shape of a progressive trance anthem, similar to a Lange mix. The single is worth grabbing just for this mix, as it's the BEST mix yet."
4,Time travel to 1949!,"________________________________________________Prospecting for Uraniumby United States Atomic Energy Commission & The United States Geological SurveyBoy, this is discount time travel! I spent about 15 years in the 60's and 70's, off and on, as a uranium prospector. While I never actually used this little book, it would have been very helpful to the tyro prospector back then, and indeed still has some good information. This is model for a field guide: pocket-size, with a sturdy, flexible cloth cover. The text is clear and informative; sadly, no author is credited.Valuable now mainly as a keepsake, and to stimulate nostalgia in oldtimers like me. Note that my copy was printed in 1949, and is probably the first edition. Original price, 30 cents!Glossary sample:""ROCK: Solid matter, composed of one or more minerals, occurring in nature.""OK, maybe a little too basic... [grin]Happy reading--Peter D. TillmanConsulting Geologist, Arizona and New Mexico (USA)"
4,Brevity Is Not Always A Bad Thing,"For someone already versed in Roman history, this book may not contain much new information, but for a reader who wants a good, short overview of the Punic Wars, then this works fine for that. At less than one-hundred pages, The Punic Wars 264-146 BC can be read in one sitting, and I found little quarrel with the author's presentation of facts or take on the conflict. Not comprehensive, not meant to be, this book is perfect for someone only wanting to gain a sound working familiarity with these conflicts."
5,Unusual Bittersweet Romance,"ANOTHER TIME, ANOTHER PLACE is a true romantic bittersweet classic. I love this unusual film from the 50s about love and its power to distort better judgment and commitment. Sean Connery steals this film with his great screen presence and a very believable performance. Glynis Johns as his faithful wife gives a very emotional performance and a good one as well. This is a very thought provoking film and examines the nature of our capacity to love and be loved but further questions the motivations for the power of love."
2,....Same Old Lana,"Can't take credit for the title of this review, it's the NY TIMES TV listings capsule summary for the flick, but sidesplittingly true. This film's from Lana's mid-period; our girl's cast adrift from the haven of MGM, but still not sunk to the depths of THE BIG CUBE. She's carefully lacquered here, and has the opposite of chemistry with leading man Sean Connery, vital and attractive in an early film role. Their Forbidden Love Is Not To Be, as he has the good sense to die early on, leaving Lana to seek out his widow, Glynis Johns, so that she can -- oh, why bother? If you've seen more than three movies in your life, you're miles ahead of every plot turn. Fun for those of us who like our popcorn sprinkled with a healthy dose of suds."
4,Fairly comprehensive,"This rather small tome is very helpful when translating legal documents bi-directionally. I use it in my profession and whilst it is far from complete, in conjuction with the Collins Unabridged English/Spanish dictionary, I am able to clear up most any question."
3,Fine,"This dictionary is fine but as with a number of bilingual legal dictionaries, has to be accompanied by others because it never has all the terms you need."
1,Typical,"I hesitated in ordering this roasting pan, because I knew there was a good chance it was not described accurately. And I was right, It is not 2.5mm, as described, but a mere 1.9 mm. Mauviel does not want anyone to understand their line-up of purposely confusing products, and they have proven it here, yet again. I'll just sell it for a loss on eBay and then try to find the pan I ordered somewhere else. What a pain."
1,Gayle Bunney is a hypocrite,I recieved this book as a christmas present and after reading the book cover I could not wait to start reading it because it sounded like Gayle Bunney loved horses almost as much as I do. Well after about the third page I realized I was sadly mistaken because instead of reading a book that sounded like it was supposed to inspire me it just depressed me.This book is not a story about a womans love of horses it is about a womans love of money.Any person that loves horses would not send them to the slaughterhouse because she deemed them to be so called useless or in other words basically not making her money. She mentions just a few pages into the book how much she loves money but funny enough did not mention once how much she loves horses well of course besides the false advertising she used on the book cover all this book was was just another way for her to exploit horses for money consistent of what she has done her whole life.
5,The Best,"This was the kind of book I would not have normally read.But,when it was recommended and I begin to read this book I could not put it down,it was one of the best I have ever read and definitly worth the time reading it."
5,Fixing Overgrown Lives,"A home swap brings two women together, and they learn more about each other than they know about themselves."
3,A Novel of Secrets and Betrayal,"Tara Road is the home of Ria and Danny Lynch. There they move in and work on the huge elaborate home to make it their dream. Ria, a stay-at-home mom, endlessly smiling to keep up her house and the happiness of her children and work-a-holic husband. Everything seems perfect to Ria until her world comes crashing down on her when Danny tells her he is leaving for another woman.A chance phone call gives Ria the opportunity to swap homes with an American woman for the Summer. Ria sees this house exchange as a chance to get away from her problems and eagerly jumps on the opportunity.The American woman has secrets of her own she is running away from. In different countries, in different homes, these women find their strength and courage and who they really are."
3,Great travel reading,"A quick read, as are all of Binchy's books. Very predictable...the women are strong and most men jerks."
4,Page turner,"Tara Road is the first book I've read by Maeve Binchy and it will not be the last. I was hooked from page one, immediately calming my nerves about tackling a book of that size, fearing it would not hold my interest. It did. I could relate to the characters, feel their emotions and understand their situations. It was a charming, thought provoking book that made me examine some of my own actions. I would recommend it to anyone willing to take a closer look at themselves."
2,So-so,"Tara Road is definitely not one of Binchy's best books. Although the storylines interact well as they usually do in her works, I care so little about most of the characters that I had to force myself to keep reading. Very drawn out in places, especially the early descriptions of home life in the Lynch household. The female characters are very static, especially Annie after she hits adolescence. All we see is her picking at her brother, and it gets very old after the 6th scene where she tells him to shut up. Ria, Rosemary, Gertie, Marilyn, Hilary, Nora, et al, none of them are people I would want to know. This is the first Binchy book I haven't been drawn into and thoroughly enjoyed, so I am really disappointed! The modern setting of the book doesn't help it either, and the introduction of the Internet feels forced.I am sorry I could not review this book more positively, but I really took a dislike to the whole effort and can't shake it."
3,"Great Start, but Too Long and not Developed","The first 100 pages totally grabs you and you can't put the book down, but then the story starts dragging, and leaves too many unanswered questions. Why does Danny never want to see his parents or his siblings? This question is brought up throughout the book, but it is never resolved. Maeve Binchy's a good writer, but I believe she lost control of the story after a while. Characters are brought in without any sort of introduction, and halfway through the book, there are too many to keep track of. The reader ends up forgeting who's who, and the story becomes frustrating to deal with. You end up not caring about the characters, and the story becomes too long with little redeeming value. Great idea, but weak follow-up."
4,Another enjoyable Binchy novel,"Tara Road, like most of Maeve Binchy's books, is an absorbing and entertaining read. I became so absorbed in the lives of these characters that I was sorry it had to end. A great novel, but Binchy has yet to top ""Circle of Friends"", her best work yet."
1,I Have Read Better Binchey,"I found Tara Road a huge disappointment. The characters seemed to be made of cardboard, and they repeated themselves endlessly throughout the book. I had the distinct impression that Binchey was challenged to write a 500 page book and proved that she could. It was simply not interesting. I wonder how I managed to finish it."
2,Disappointed,"I so enjoyed bits and pieces of this book. There was a lot of honesty about people's lives, how others let you down, how we rewrite our own histories sometimes. But overall it was vapid, detached, irregular, and depressing. You never felt part of their lives. It was extremely frustrating to me to have to read through in detail 280 pages to get to the point where you know on page 3 the story is going anyway. Ridiculous. But what blew my mind the most and let me down was the lack of closure. There simply was no feel-good ending, no happiness at the end. Just loss and a feeling of waste. No rejuvenation was I felt the story needed."
5,Maeve Binchy fans will be pleased with her newest novel.,"Once again, Ms. Binchy has written an engrossing tale about a cluster of villagers who live on Tara Road. The vignettes and descriptions make for fascinating reading as the reader becomes intimately acquainted with each character. This book is highly recommended."
3,disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Binchy but I found this one rather disappointing, not nearly as good as ""circle of Friends"". The plot was thin, the characters got on my nerves - so much of it was predictable. If you want a really luscious read go to ""of Marriageable Age"" by Sharon Maas which I discovered in England this summer! It 's a bit expensive cos it's an import but worth it! (also available on the uk site)"
3,A pleasant read.,"She spins a good yarn, but it's formula Binchy again: Too long and rambling, weak and predictable ending. In the romance novel genre, I prefer books by Rosamunde Pilcher. They're written with greater depth and finesse."
3,Thought Provoking,"I finished Tara Road this afternoon and have spent the rest of the day trying to figure out if I liked it or not. When starting this book I felt like I was reading something ""light and fluffy"" but as the story continued I could not put it down.The characters were interesting but predictable. I could not get myself to completely care for Ria, she was so nave. I did however like Rosemary. Sure she had some major flaws and was not a ""good"" person, but I enjoyed her nonetheless.This book is like real life in a way, no one wins in the end but the good outlasts the bad."
4,Tara Road,I read this as soon as it came out and liked it quite a lot. The book as interesting characters and an okay plot. I enjoyed reading it and I liked how it ended. It was a really good book but Binchy has written better.
2,Too Drawn Out,"Although I enjoyed the story itself, I felt the book was too drawn out. The characters weren't fully developed until quite a bit into the book, and by then I was too frustrated to care."
3,tara road,I enjoyed the story.But I thought they should have spoken with a Irish accent They spoke to american and almost acted to american also.
4,A LOVELY BOOK FROM A GREAT WRITER,"TARA ROAD it's a book about love, yes. ""So what's new with that - you might ask - if love is a subject explored by thousands of writers since Eve was still virgin?"" The difference, I answer, is that you're about to read a book by Maeve Binchy, and she knows how to do it under her own way. That's the difference.This book it's not like all the others. It has an adorable plot that will enchant you upside down, characters that have the power to make you laugh and cry with the same ease, and it's told by a master storyteller. This said, I can't tell nothing else about Maeve's books. Read the book. You'll know why it was so acclaimed by the public in general, doesn't matter if they are in the USA or living under the ground.Marco Aurelio - contact: deankoontzfan@hotmail.com"
3,MEDIOCRE,"Way, way too drawn out and redundant. Would have been an ejoyable easy read were it not for the endless (and needless) repetitions. Binchy is clearly a good storyteller, she just needs a good editor!"
3,Hard to put down,"I read the book in two days. The characters were so well written you just had to know how their stories unfold. At times there doesn't seem to be a mystery of what's happening to them or going to happen. But like a good soap opera plot, you just had to know whether you're right or wrong. Thus, you read on and on. The way some events turn out isn't the way you imagined it would. All in all, if a book is hard to put down, then it's definitely a good read."
4,Great Book.. A little surprised it's an Oprah pick,"I just read Tara Road last week (am I psychic or what?) and really enjoyed it. I was surprised, however, to hear that it was picked by Oprah. I am so used (and happy to be) to learning of new authors that this was a shock! However, I think that Tara Road is a wonderful introduction to reading Maeve Binchy, and I also recommend her Evening Class and Circle of Friends."
4,Another winner from Maeve,"I've read all of Binchy's novels with delight (except for Firefly Summer which I hated)and this one was especially good. She is such a great storyteller and I was especially charmed by Ria and her children. The ending wasn't the strongest or most satisfying (hence 4, instead of 5, stars) but then again I was so sad to be leaving these new found friends that perhaps any ending would have disappointed me! There was a sequel for Light A Penny Candle...maybe for this one too?"
5,Another really good Binchy book!,"I read this all at once. I have a habit of doing that with her books. It's not that the book is that overwhelmingly great, it's just that I really enjoy reading Maeve Binchy's stories. A great book to read on the upcoming yukky days."
5,excellent from start to finish,"I thought this was an excellent read I couldn't put it down. I was so involved with these people's lives that I thought that I actually knew them. I am a big fan of Meave Binchy and have read all her books. I really liked the Copper Beech and Circle of Friends, although I wasn't too thrilled when they made a movie as it wasn't the same. Let's hope they don't do that to this one. I am waiting patiently for her next book now."
3,Needed more editing,"I found this book a very easy read, but lacking in continuity. I did not find it plausible that Ria would think that Danny was coming back to her - and her working while on vacation made no sense at all! The forune tellar really had no bearing on the plot. The split between Danny and Ria should have come sooner in the book and spent more time on the reshaping of Ria and her kids lives."
3,"Okay, but not one of Binchy's best","I am a big Maeve Binchy fan and have read all of her books. Tara Road was okay, but not on the top of my Binchy book list. The characters seemed to get stronger as you read along, but I was glad to see the last chapter. It was a quick, easy read and would be a good book to toss in the suitcase to read during a road trip or long weekend away from home."
2,Overated!,"At first I was very interested in this book. I did read it very quickly, but I was very disappointed. The main character, Ria, was very poorly developed as were the supporting characters. I felt like I was watching a soap opera. A very long, very dull soap opera."
2,Semi entertaining.,"I had hoped for a better read. I enjoyed the first few chapters and thought that I might be reading a good book, only to find that it was more of the same repititous story throughout every chapter. There was a lot written about nothing. I thought it was a watered down plot and I was very dissappointed in the end. I expected more from this author based what I have heard about her previous books."
5,By far the best one yet!,"Each time I read one of Maeve Binchy's book I say the next one just can't get better, but it always does. The characters are well thought out, and the plot always keeps you guessing. Another masterpiece!"
1,Will it ever end???,"Oprah what happened to you??? I just don't get it. I can't believe all these wonderful reviews...what am I missing????? I have read Circle of Friends and would give it maybe 3 stars but Tara Road is PAINFULLY long and tedious. I hate to pay money for a hardback and find myself skipping over whole paragraphs. This book does not hold my interest, it is way way too long and I am soooo tired of it but determined to finish!!! Come on Oprah, I have read every single one of your picks and this one ranks right up at the top for being a ""mystery pick"" to me!! Oh well, you can't win them all!!!Ha"
5,Binchy just gets better and better.,"In Tara Road, Maeve Binchy has given us grown-up characters and tangled them all up in their daily Irish lives. In her usual fresh and sparkling way,she creates the solution to their problems and keeps the pages turning. Binchy does not let us down in her latest Irish read."
2,"Boring, not the usual Maeve Binchy","Like most people, I waited, with anticipation for this book, sadly, very disapointed. The characters are dull,totally lacking in depth, you almost wish to shake some life into them. Not Ms. Binchy best offering. Wait until it's out in paperback, it's not worth the money, even with Amazon's great prices."
3,"Typical Binchy, but not her best, not second either.","I only started reading Binchy's works from The Glass Lake which won my heart right away. I went back to some of her old works which are ok. (If not satisfied, I'll said ""that's old, she is good now.) The Evening Class, in my opinion is a masterpiece. Maybe that's why Tara Road is such a dispointment to me. As one of the viewers said, I kept reading and reading and going nowhere until half of the pages are gone . I still like her a lot and I will continue to buy her next book. Hope the next one will be as good as The Evening Class."
1,Worst book in years,It is amazing that this book is one of Oprah's picks. The dialogue is too corny and the characters are one-dimensional. This book was a total drag - from start to finish.
2,Surprised this was picked for the Oprah Book Club,"I am very surprised that this book was selected for the Oprah Book Club. The quality of the writing and the character development were not up the standard of the other Oprah books I have read. The writing was very simplistic and the characters were very one-sided and predictable. Many times, I felt like I was reading a grocery store romance novel."
1,Not my type.,"This book was very hard to read, too many characters being introduced at one time and there were none I found interesting enough to want to keep reading."
2,"Very boring and slow at the beginning, but gets a little better.","The book starts out very slow and boring. Up to page 250 I found myself flipping the pages. There are at least 150 pages of this book that could be easily excluded from the book.The story is very typical, a housewife completely in love with her husband has absolutely no idea that he has been cheating on her for a long time, she is completely naive and stays that way till the end of the book, but in the end she discovers that she can survive the break up. There is absolutely nothing fresh or original about the story line, and more or less it feels like the same story you've read about before told by another author. However, the second half of the book is entertaining and funny at times, therefore I would recommend it for a long flight or few hours when you need to kill some time."
3,Read to the end!,"I found the book to be decent. My book club read it and we all agreed that the first 400-500 pages were good, but slow. The last 100 pages were great! If you decide to read it, hold on to the end, don't get bogged down in the beginning. The ending is the best part."
3,A pot boiler,"Lovely packaging, tied up too nicely at the end with a bow. Interesting cast of characters, some of which are woefully underdeveloped. Predictable but enjoyable. Tara Road is a place I'd like to live, but not a reality."
4,One of Binchy's more touching!!,Maeve Binchy is my favorite author & I've read a lot of her books but this was very different from what she normally does. I was really suprised at how touching & emotional & personal Tara Road was. All of her books have that type of plot but she really showed the emotions the characters go through during the plot really rawly.She spent about the first 230 pages describing the plot very boringly & I didn't think I'd like this book very much due to that but ending up really enjoying it b/c I saw later the signifigance & reasoning for it. Maeve had to make a perfected existance for the character's family to show later how much it was really destroyed & how deeply the people were affected by it. I was astonished at this novel at how deep Binchy dug down to get those emotions & really make you feel it.
2,Binchy not at her best,"I cannot put my finger on it but somehow I felt dissappointed with this book.I am a huge Binchy fan and had read and reread almost all of her books at least a thousand times but this one I left on the shelf after one read.It is not that I did not enjoy it,I simply felt it lacked that something special one uasually finds with her.Maybe Ria was too naive,or Danny got away with too much for too long,who knows?I just know it did not have that uasual spellbinding effect I had come to expect from her."
1,Waste of time,"If you want to invest in reading about half of this weighty tome, you will find the more interesting characters. Otherwise, you will read only daily tedium about the main character.The plot is predictable, the characters not well sketched and the ending unsatisfactory."
1,Shockingly bad.,"Those of us who have come to expect total delight from a Maeve Binchy read are sorely disappointed with TARA, a pointless exercise that meanders this way, then that way, then jumps over here. Flat, unbelievable characters, pointless plot twists and a big build-up to nothing were the hallmarks, for me, of TARA ROAD."
4,"The style is very familiar, well written but a little too...","As usual I read this piece, a fantastically written tale, but I though it was very much like ""Circle of Friends"", Obviously the plot is different. But you've got the 'Danny' character which is exactly like 'Jack'. Then 'Rosemary' is exactly like 'Nan' and 'Benny' like 'Ria'. It was all too familiar. Why in every Maeve Binchy novel that I read does the husband cheat on the wife? It seems to be a repeat! In ""Light a Penny Candle."" 'Johnny' was a lot like 'Danny'. Of course all the characters have many dimensions but on the whole the resemblance is astonishing. 'Elizabeth' is also very weak like 'Ria' and 'Benny' but very lovable characters, You get the impression Binchy herself is either the complete oposite or carbon copy..."
5,Thank you Maeve Binchy,Tara Road - Yes !! She did it again and will probably do it several times more. When I was done reading it I could have cried that there were no more pages of this magnificent book. I look forward to reading more of Maeve Binchy - the best author ever!!!
4,Very enjoyable.,"Wonderful read. I enjoyed the book very much. I'm wondering how Oprah picks her books. Sometimes there so difficult and at others very light reading. I think she should have recommended ""Angela's Ashes"". ""Tara Road"" is quick reading and non stop, Oprah gave everyone a break."
5,It was in excellent condition.,It was in excellent condition. t was an excellent story and I really like the way the author writes. I recommend it.
2,Unlikable Characters,"I kept reading this book, because I kept waiting for the characters to all have some sort of an epiphany and change, but they never did. Almost every single character in this book is completely unlikable, and when I was done reading it, I could care less about what happened to any of them."
4,A story for all women,"At first I was hesitant to read this story because I thought it sounded like another stereotypical romance novel, but it definitely breaks the mold. The characters are so endearing, especially the main character, Ria. She is a gentle, loving house wife that is appreciative of her husband, home and family, but when tragedy tears apart her life she finds strength and a sense of independence in the midst of her heartache. Every character is so real they all feel like someone you know personally: a friend, a sister, a neighbor, your children. The author beautifully intertwines their lives to create a rich tapestry of experiences. Maeve Binchy is another wonderful Irish storyteller."
2,maybe it's just me,"Maybe it's just me...I was happy to receive this paperback copy, especially since it's set in Ireland initially, and I was completely enchanted with Ireland on my visits there. Also, some of my very favorite books have been Oprah's selections. But I am giving up after 140 pages. Is it ever going to be anything more than a typical soap opera? ""Angela's Ashes"" it's not! Sorry, but I can't really maintain an interest in any of the predictable, stereotypical characters."
2,"These women needs backbones, STAT!!!","I picked up this book because it was an Oprah Book CLub book and I had several waiting for me to read.I found it hollow and not as OBC worthy as others, like Middlesex which I just finished prior to Tara Road.Tara Road is replete with weak female characters: a doormat in Ria, a punching bag in Gertie, a wealthy backstabbing friend, etc etc.I wanted to jump into their world and shake some sense into them! WHy must all the women be weak and accomodating and most of the male characters successful and in control (if not domineering)?I did find it enjoyable along the way but in the end I felt as if I wasted 600+ pages of reading on a stupid woman's book."
3,Tara Road,This book had a thread of commonness throughout the theme and was quite predictable. It was a fast read and is one to read if you just want to read and not think deeply.
4,"One more chapter, please.","The book was very enjoyable to read. It was definately a page turner. The women portrayed in the book seemed very realistic and by the end you wanted a few more chapters to see what would happen next. I really liked the fact that there were two women, one a professional and one a homemaker, struggling in a parallel fashion. Neither were weak and both conquered their fears. I really liked this book and would recommend it to anyone."
3,Did I miss something?,"If you are a person who like the bad guys and gals to get their just rewards, this book isn't for you. How could Maeve let Danny and Rosemary get away with such outrageous behavior. Although I initially enjoyed the book, hoping it was going somewhere, I finished thinking this is it! Why did Oprah pick this book to read? I definitely had questions and I also felt a bit dissatisfied. Juicy, but no satisfaction. How can this be?"
2,women only,"I just did not like it. Nothing is really happening and it just drags on and on. In my opinion the characters are quite boring, maybe just like in real life. Anyway, I think it might be a nice book for women, but men, stay away from it!"
3,A good enough book but a little weak for an Oprah choice.,Tara Road was a decent read. It just wasn't a great read. I was more than halfway through the book before I started to care about the characters. There were so many characters that I found myself having to stop and remember who some of them were. Maybe that's just due to my bad memory. It was not exactly a book I would have expected Oprah to pick for her book club.
3,A Nice Book,"Tara Road is a chick book tome. I enjoyed it, but compared to other things I have read, can only give it 3 stars. It was lovely, just not that original. I got a little weary of the main character, Ria Lynch and, frankly, wanted her to be just a little more interesting. One of the things that is important to me in reading a book is that I learn something,. . . anything really can qualify. I can't say Tara Road really checked that block."
5,I just want to say: READ IT!,"""Tara Road"" is a story about love, life and friendship. The book is about two women, both having live crisis. You are following Ria's and Danny's life in Dublin, from the bright beginning through troubled times. Danny leaves Ria for a younger woman and Ria don't want to except that the marriage is over. On the other side of the ocean, in USA, Marilyne Vine has lost her son in a motorbike accident. The two women decide to change house for the summer and that decision will change their lives. Maeve Binchy writes in a language which makes me feel like I'm a friend of the main characters. I think that the book wants to show women that they are able to stand on their own feet and that they are worth full without a man on their side. I really, really liked this book and I can recommend everybody to read it."
2,Disappointed,"Sorry to you all, but I didn't like the book. I am very disappointed, I thought the story would be so great, but I couldn't finish the book. I didn't like how its written, and the way events are presented.It is a very slow-reading book! I kept yawning through out all the pages that I read.I don't recommend it at all."
2,Not Worthy of Oprah or Maeve,"I agree with the nay-sayers -- I am a Binchy fan but found this one to be a bore; in fact, about 3/4 through it started speed-reading just to find out the answers to the very few things that interested me."
3,Engrossing characters but unsatisfying ending,"I found that once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. I became fascinated with the character of Ria- would she ever wake up and tell Danny to get lost? What would happen next with the rest of the characters? At first, I was thoroughly depressed with the passivity of some of the female characters, then toward the end of the book they seemed to grow strong and independent. The devious characters such as Mona's husband, Polly, Rosemary, etc. seemed to ""get theirs"" in the end. The best part ofcourse was the way the house/life exchange between Ria and Marilyn transformed their lives. Marilyn finally could face the death of her son and was able to talk to her husband again. Ria developed some business skills and strengthened her ties to her children. ""Lucky Marilyn"" had her husband, Ria had her children. But I wasn't satisfied with the ending. It was too abrubt- and what would happen to Ria and Danny? I was left with an uneasy feeling."
5,The best Binchy book so far!,"I have loved Maeve Binchy's books for years, my favorites being ""Light A Penny Candle"" and ""The Glass Lake"". ""Tara Road"" has more twists than her previous books. I could NOT put it down! Too much was going on. What a talented lady she is!"
4,What an enjoyable read!,"I like Maeve Binchy a lot. ""Evening Class"" is still one of my very favorite books!""Tara Road"" is Binchy at her best and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this story.The only problem I had was Ria's inability to believe that Danny was gone from her life. She struck me as a bit too clingly, but she recovered and began a new life for herself and her children.I liked Marilyn's story, too.I highly recommend this book, especially if you are tired of reading mediocre fiction...Binchy's tales are always meat and potates with very little fluff!Enjoy!"
2,Missing in action - Ms. Binchy's editor,"One star because it's mostly set in Ireland (personal prejudice); another star because of Maeve Binchy's earlier work. But where was the editor? The 'action' doesn't start until around page 250 and it's a slog to get there. Even the most neophyte of writers wouldn't be allowed to get away with the broad generalizations and cliches that run throughout this book.For emotional depth, for a real insight to Ms. Binchy's strengths, read The Copper Beech or Circle of Friends. Give this one a miss."
1,Binchy needs to stick to short stories,"I have being reading Binchy since she first wrote her short stories "" Dublin 4, and London Transports"", as well as her colum in the Irish Times, but over the years, the books she has come out with have got worse. Her first novel ""Light a Penny Candle"" was good but it has being a painstaking experience reading all the trash that has followed. Maeve, please go back to the short stories, you are great at it."
2,Zzzzzz,"Tara Road follows the story of two women faced with heartbreak and loss. Ria and Marilyn, the two main characters, switch lives as a way to distant themselves from the pain and sorrow they are trying to face. Although the first three chapters held my interest, I became somehwat disconnected with the characters and the story line and found it a hard book to keep reading and believing in. Still, this book was selected as an ""Oprah"" book so there must be a reason others will enjoy this story even if I didn't."
1,Horribly boring and mundane,"I have read alot of books in my 28 yrs, and I must say this has to be one of the most boring I've ever read. Danny is a creep, Ria is a wimp and their kids seem to be rotten. Not to mention the length of the book. It took me FOREVER to finish it and I'm sorry to say that I may never pick up another of Maeve Binchy's books. Stick to good ones such as Plainsong or Gap Creek!"
1,Don't read it if you want to read quality literature.,She may have creative storylines but she is an atrocious writer. Don't do it. Save your reading energies for quality writing.
3,Definitely different!,"""Tara Road"" started out soooo slow and boring that I wondered if I'd be able to finish it at all. The one thing that saved the book was the house switching of Ria and Marilyn. Marilyn seemed to bring something good to the house and saw Danny for what he was: a snake. For the reviewer who wondered who was with Rosemary the day Annie spotted them? Her father, most likely. Seemed like Danny slept with anything with legs! OK book, I might read another of hers eventually."
1,writing a review without spoiling the damn book!,This message is for the READER from South Dakota who went on to list all of the story's emotional moments as part of her review. You should not write reviews lady! People check out your words of wisdom when they are thinking of purchasing the novel. Next time skip the details and give a REVIEW please!
3,Tara Road,A mediocre story about 2 women who switch residences: one in England and one in America. It shows how the change of scenery gives them each a new perspective and allows them to accept their life circumstances better. (This is not one of the better Maeve Binchy stories).
2,"A WASTE OF TIME! VERY BORING!- YUK,YUK,YUK!","THIS BOOK STARTED OUT OK-AS I READ FURTHER INTO THE STORY, I FOUND MYSELF ACTUALLY SKIMMING AND THEN FLIPPING THROUGH THE PAGES. THERE IS NO POINT IN THIS STORY THAT ACTUALLY CAPTURED MY ATTENTION. VERY BORING. THE ENDING WAS TERRIBLE-IT SEEMED THAT THE AUTHOR RAN OUT OF THING TO SAY."
3,ok but disappointing conclusion,"Have read a few of her books and generally enjoyed them, but was very disappointed in this book. The description on the back (2 women switching houses) was not what this book was about. I would have liked more of the American character or a little more back and forth earlier on in the novel. Ria is an idiot, frankly, and I had a hard time sympathizing with her. Also, too many story lines without sufficient explanation, conclusions; things were resolved too quickly or not at all. Ok for a beach read or the train, but nothing to get excited about."
2,"Not near Maeve Binchys former, wonderfully written stories","The beginning of the story was, to me, pure Maeve Binchy, then, the storyline became disjointed and characters not well formed. I have read all the previous works and felt like a stranger had penned this book. The dust jacket was beautiful enough to be framed."
3,Good book!!!,"This was my first time reading Maeve Binchy's work. The book was one that I could put down and simply read at my leisure. I enjoyed reading Tara Road; however, there are so many characters, it is very important to read carefully and follow the storyline of each. I would not recommend purchasing Tara Road in hardcover, but paperback would suffice."
2,Disappointing,"I am one to obtain every Maeve Binchy novel before the ink is dry - but this was not one of her better efforts. Maeve's forte is character development and relationships, and those she presented here seemed rather trite. Any reader of Maeve's work knows that her books often have their ""slow"" spots, but this was one work that seemed never to go anywhere."
4,Maeve Binchy writes another wonderful story!!!!,I read this book over the summer so I was surprised when Oprah picked it for this month's book. It is so much different than previous picks however I really enjoyed it. The characters are created so carefully and lovingly by Ms. Binchy that you begin to think that you know them. I have read all of Ms. Binchy's books so I am happy that she will not only have critical acclaim but a best selling novel.
2,I was surprised when I heard Oprah picked this book.,"A little too easy to read if you know what I mean- written at a 8th grade reading level. I thought this book was a little too long and lacking any any good characters. Ria was unrealistically ""perfect"" - great wife, mother, cook, friend, daughter, sister and homemaker. The other main female character was more interesting and less predictable. Both women were quite different. While Ria was warm and open - Marliyn was cold and private. Although they both had experienced terrible tragedies, I had trouble feeling sorry for either of them."
1,Bought it at the airport & left it on the plane,"Yuck...this poorly written book should be an embarrassment to the author. She has so obviously written a formulaic, commercially appealing book, geared toward the Romance reader set. But they deserve much more. Mousy heroine lands a cool guy, his ambitions move them up in society, and she tags along. Plot twists ensue. ZZZZZZZZ. The characterizations are skin-deep at best but the author persists in moving her puppet-like people through their paces. It was utterly unsatisfying. After reading it for a couple hours, (I bought it at the airport since I thought Circle of Friends was kinda OK)I slammed it shut in frustration, offered it to my airplane seatmate, who then had the same experience. We laughed as we left it on the plane as we disembarked."
5,WONDERFUL!,"THIS WAS THE FIRST BINCHY BOOK I READ AND I WAS HOOKED, SINCE THEN I HAVE READ ABOUT EIGHT OTHERS INCLUDING CIRCLE OF FRIENDS WHICH IS ALSO EXCELLENT. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Too wordy for me!,"I found this book very slow moving. I tried and tried. Usually I can't put a good book down. The story sounded good, but I guess I never made it that far..."
4,A wonderful book,"I really loved Tara Road, and the story of the characters' interwoven lives through the years, centered mainly, in the first half of the book, in Ria and Danny's renovated Victorian. Almost the entire cast of characters eventually live or work there, in their own little universe. Ria's life drastically changes, and she's able to exchange houses for two months with an American, who has also had a cataclysmic event in her life. Both women, out of their own familiar environments, are forced to react to different situations: in Ria's case, she finds she can be a lot more self-reliant and decisive than she'd ever had to be before. Marilyn cannot remain aloof and separate from people and their emotions on Tara Road. Both their lives are enlarged by their separate experiences."
5,DID NOT WANT IT TO END!!!,I tried to just read a little bit per day to make it last but ended up 'gobbling' it all up in a weekend!!! I am still wanting to know how things go - the kids were so neat - I'd like to 'watch' them grow up. Finally a book recommendation from Oprah that wasn't totally depressing!!
5,Wonderfully Binchy,"I was lucky enough to be able to pick up the paperback version in London earlier this month since the paperback is already out in the U.K. This is classic Binchy. The characters are well developed and the reader knows each of them well. Although the story is long, I wanted to know more as it ended with some additional questions of ""what happened..."" I felt myself cheering on Ria and being angry with Danny. Simply a wonderful read."
2,Bookclub Nightmare,"If you are interested in this book, do yourself a favor -- save $25 and read the inside cover at the bookstore. It sums up the entire story and will save you hours of laborious reading. I managed to finish Tara Road only because it was required for a monthly book club meeting.The plot has a slow start and highly predictable ending. Even more frustrating is the ""heroine"" of the story, Ria, repeatedly behaving like a complete doormat. It was maddening to endure this character's lack of self esteem and personality!For a 500+ page book, the narrow character development was a bonafide let-down. There was exorbitant detail about what every person was wearing and doing, but rarely was there any insight into what these characters were actually thinking. The popularity of this book is absolutely baffling."
4,Great light reading!,"This is not a major piece of literature. Nor, is it the best of M Binchy's books. Nevertheless, she has developed her characters well and you will soon find yourself wrapped up in their story."
3,tara road,this book was way too long at 500 plus pages. I think she could've accomplished the same thing at like 250 pages. I wont be reading it again.
4,"A Book of Recovery, Trust and Independence","If you are looking for a medium length novel that makes you feel good about emotional recovery from setback, human trust and women independence, it can be a good choice.It is not the type that impresses immediately. But it does make you feel comfortable by stages.It carries a positive message about women independence. They are not men's subjects.They have their own emotions, choices and life circle."
5,I would give it 100 stars if possible!,"I have read through some of the other reviews and simply could not believe everyone didn't have the same experience as I did when they read the book. I am an avid book reader, who enjoys all genres...however, this was the first Maeve Binchy book I have picked up. I was so hooked on the book that I took it everywhere I went. I walked around the house carrying it and would stay up into the wee hours of the night to read it. The book was so wonderful that I actually didn't want it to end. I am hoping Maeve will write a sequel because I find myself wondering what could've happened with the characters even now - a month after I've finished reading the book. Trust me....if you've never read Maeve Binchy, this is the perfect book to start with. You will love it!!"
3,"A Not So Great ""Marriage Gone Wrong"" Story","I was not particularly fond of this book. The character development was there, as usual, but the story line was a little lackluster. I was surprised because I had previously read ""Firefly Summer"" and just loved it.This is a book about a couple who meet at work and fall in love. They buy an old mansion and fix it up over the years. The husband does the wife wrong eventually (a younger woman -- shock!) and the woman struggles with how to go on. It turns out that even her beautiful, successful, self-obsessed best friend has been doing her wrong.This read more like a wah-wah Nora Roberts to me than a Maeve Binchy. Not her best work in my opinion."
3,I kept waiting and waiting for the story to begin!,"From the reviews of Tara Road, I expected the book to evolve around two women and their exchange of homes. I eagerly started the book, curious how this exchange would occur. Chapter 1, then Chapter 2, I read more and more, still waiting. Well over half of the book was read before the story truly began. Don't get me wrong, the first of the book isn't poorly written, but it is very slow-moving. Tara Road has two very distinct parts. The first gives us a thorough, sometimes sophomoric account of Ria and Danny's marriage. The second, which I found much more enjoyable, tells how Ria and Marilyn come to exchange homes and heal wounds from major hurts in their lives."
2,"Pleasant book, but not captivating-lacked depth of character","The premise and story behind this book were very pleasant; however, it was ""lightweight"". I didn't get the feeling that I ""knew"" the characters like you do in many books. I'm not even sure what they really looked like via the book. There were many characters, a lot of switching back and forth via story lines (think soap opera) and a general vagueness of the characters. When something happy/sad/pleasant happened, you didn't ""feel"" it; it was quite generic. It was a very long book with nothing really to bite into. Also, there was a question/situation that was alluded to, but was never answered. I won't be reading this author again."
4,Touching...Hard to read...hard to put down...sad and happy,This book brought into view the pain that goes on behind closed dooors...how so many people are not able to be honest or faithful...how the truly loving and trusting end up hurt. It was a realistic snapshot of life in the 90's. Sad...hurried...indulgent...never thinking of anyone else...selfish...
4,Loved the characters,"Although it took me about 120 pages to get hooked, once I got into this book, I couldn't put it down. I loved the characters and the involvement they all had in each other's lives. By the end of the book, I felt like I was friend of Ria's. I was sorry when I finished Tara Road."
3,"No, not her best, but worth reading","Too long a set up, too much dialogue, not enough of those narratives that allow characters to reveal themselves slowly . . . Binchy is perhaps at her best with books like ""Circle of Friends,"" ""Echoes,"" and ""The Glass Lake."" Maybe we American readers prefer that approach because Binchy does it so charmingly and that's what we look for . . . Ria just didn't engage me. In fact, no character did. Ms Binchy, we love you, but bring back Benny and Eve!"
3,Mine was a feeling of disappointment.,"I have aways been a fan of the books of Maeve Binchy. Nothing will ever change that. She gives us a realistc view of modern day Ireland but her latest book, ""Tara Road,"" proved to be something of a letdown after ""Evening Class"" and ""The Glass Lake."" After reading her book I sent it around the family for them to read and found my opinion wasn't necessarily shared by them. Although I didn't think this was her best work, I will always look foreward to this author's work. As an Irish-American I am greatly impressed with the work of today's contemporary Irish authors. There are some excellent authors working in that country today and Maeve Binchy is among them. Her characters are always well drawn and those in ""Tara Road"" are no exception."
2,oh ria..have some self respect,didnt like it... characters very predictable..very mundane....i liked nothing...sorry..and that Ria i wanted to give her a good shake and tell her to get real...
5,I think this is my all time FAVORITE book!!!!:),I absolutely LOVED it! This was a story that captured my heart and my imagination from page 1. What more can I say but I highly recommend this book and I wish I could find more that were as good a read as this 1! Just FABULOUS!!!!:)
4,Tara Road,"Another great book by Maeve Binchy.The crazy idea of two women, Ria and Marilyn, swapping houses and discovering different lifestyles in their new temporary homes comes across as a realistic adventure. They not only learn about new places, make new friends, but they also do a lot of soul searching and selfdiscovery in the time they spend in each others houses. It is never too late for a fresh start if you put your mind to it.Marilyn being American and Ria Irish, living worlds apart, leave their lifes behind them for a short while to discover how the other lives. Binchy's characters are strong and I became familiar with them very fast and felt like I knew them and shared their adventure.Detailed descriptions of the places where the story takes place and of the people living there, make the story come to life.The book is easy to read, interesting, and entertaining. The writing is down to earth and makes it a pleasure to follow the characters in their endeavors."
4,By a Woman for Women,"I try and read most of the Oprah Book Club picks. This is good fiction and worth reading, but it is not great or one of my favorites. It is enjoyable and definitely a cut above most story lines written to appeal to women. I thought the main character and her life description about living on Tara Road, a shabby turned chic area were very interesting. The wife's mixed emotions about her husband's ambition were great. It also develops the friendship theme and our main character has some true good friends whose characters are also well developed. Definitely worth giving a try."
4,A good read,"This was my second Mauve Binchy novel, having read Light a Penney Candle first. I found this books characters more compelling and liked her writing style in this her more current write. If you are looking for a novel with lots of characters that you can become involved with you will enjoy this one. I llok forward to reading many more of Mauve Binchy's works."
4,A Book for Everyone.,"When I started reading Tara Road I thought the story would be predictable. In ways it was. But it is the route this story took that kept me interested along with it's great characters. Binchy gives us a wonderful world of characters that are linked together in a beautifully believable way. I cannot see how anyone can read this book and not see themselves in at least one or more of these characters. This trully is a book for anybody. Ria, the main character, will give any reader a real story of strength and growth. This is a story about life, growing, friends and lies."
3,Easy predictable read,"This is a good read for your commute or while on vacation. Unfortunately, it was very predictable. Another book on lousy men doing things to ""nice"" women."
2,Do you enjoy reading soap operas?,"Ms. Binchy is a good story-teller and a ""could-be better"" writer than what she has shown in this book. I have read quite a few of her previous books and enjoyed The Lilac Bus and Silver Wedding, especially.Unfortunately Ms. Binchy succumbed to the modern-day and, far too prevalent, ""paid by the number of words written"" syndrome. Having struggled through more than 400 of its 500+ pages, I do plan to finish this book. I'll at least credit Ms. Binchy with her above-average storytelling ability. As she tells her story involving a multitude of characters, she also turns the story into a soap opera: who's having an affair with whom, will the abused wife get away from under her husband's alcoholic rage .... Like any good soap opera, ""we want to know""! And like any good soap opera, the stories must go on and on!"
3,Disappointing (but even a mediocre Binchey is a good read),"Ms. Binchey is a gifted storyteller. Her other works are opulent in imagery. Her characters drew the reader into their lives. Unfortunately, Tara Road is not one of Ms. Binchey's better books. Neither the plot nor the characters in this book are very interesting. The writing seems rushed - as though to meet a publisher's deadline.If you've never read any of Maeve Binchey's books, start with Copper Beeches or Firefly Summer. But be warned, Binchey is highly addictive."
5,If you are looking for a new author please read on....,"I've been a Maeve Binchy fan since she wrote Circle of Friends, but she has, admittedly, been a little too romantic for my taste on some rare occasions...but THIS is an excellently written book. I don't want to go into detail, but trust me--it'll keep you enthralled. Maeve has a way of twisting her stories to the degree in which even the reader is perplexed (who WAS in the summer house with Rosemary when Annie stumbled across them? ) For those of you that are new to Maeve Binchy, try reading Circle of Friends first...You'll be hooked!"
3,Delete the first 400 pages.....,"I generally really like Oprah's picks. That's why I read them. This one was different. It was hard to read more than 30 pages at a time. The pace of the book all of a sudden greatly increased after about 400 pages - that's where I found the most compelling reading. To give credit to the author, the visualizations that the book invokes are wonderful and that was quite enjoyable as well. Read the book, but don't expect to fly through it. I think it would be more like a fine wine to be sipped and slowly enjoyed."
4,The review of Tara Road,"Tara Road is a book of true life. You can not trust most friends, your husband can cheat on you, your children aren't prefect and you can change your life course at 40. The book was easy to read and you really don't want it to end. You want to find out what happens to Ria and Colm and all the people on Tara Road. A good book with realistic life experience."
4,I couldn't get to the next page fast enough,"This was my first Maeve Binchy book and I must admit I could not put it down. She brings the characters to life and keeps the plot going with short sections passing back and forth between the characters. However, I was very disappointed in the ending and only hope it was left the way it was because there is going to be Tara Road II. So much was left unsaid. Did Ria ever know her husband was her best friends lover. What did Ria say when she found out Mona had saved her beloved Tara road house? I felt cheated, let's hope there is a Tara Road II"
1,Not worth reading,"This book was too long - you're halfway through the book before anything really happens. And then when something does happen, its incredibly predictable and stereotypical of the characters that for some reason took 300plus pages to introduce.I was expecting a truly great story being that this book was selected for the Oprah Book Club - but man oh man! Was I ever wrong! I have no idea how they would let this piece of fiction in there!The characters were boring, the story was boring. Everything in the book took way too long to develop."
3,hopeless soap opera fodder....but engrossing all the same,I was taken in by the 'Oprah Club' and bestseller hype while looking for some light reading and found this to be ultra lite fare. Simplistic vocabulary....soap opera fodder....but I was pulled through the whole course with interest in seeing what happens to the main characters. Nothing mind bending here and your intellect can remain in doze-mode....this is something I could have read in third grade (when I was reading Kon Tiki and Big Red).
5,"So great for a summer read, I was sorry for it to end!","I have read everything Maeve Binchy has written and this is my favorite. The development of her characters make them so believable you could recognize them in the supermarket! Not a lot of boring detail but to-the-point storyline. I quickly learned to love Ria, but wanted to shake her for her naivete. Thanks, Ms. Binchy"
5,Maeve is a colorful writer.,"I admit, it took me a few chapters to get into this book, but once I did, I couldn't put it down. Enjoyed all the characters and the detail of all their lives and the descriptions of the homes, landscapes, gardens, etc. Felt like I was there. I look forward to her next novel."
4,Enjoyed it more than I expected..,"Just finished reading The Bingo Queens of Paradise and fell hook, line and sinker for it, so I wasn't sure I was really ready for something new--but I was, and I'm glad I bought and read Tara Road. Thanks for a great read Maeve Binchy."
2,"Too predictable, simple, light","I couldn't wait to finish this book, just so I could get it out of the way. 500 + pages of knowing what's going to happen is just too much. But, if you are looking for a light read, this is the one. The idea of house and culture switching held some promise, but was not nearly as interesting as it could have been. This book is no, ""Mother of Pearl."""
3,too much like a soap opera,"I felt the book was well written and moved along nicely, I however did not find it terribly enlightening or thought provoking."
2,Tara Road,"I was very disappointed with this book. The only reason I finished it was because I paid 18.00 for it. I also began skipping pages just to get on with it already. At times it was almost painfully boring to keep reading it. When looking over some of the other rave reviews, I can't help but wonder, were we reading the same book? Lisa Rodriguez Cleveland,Ohio"
2,Mediocre,"Mediocre, Mediocre and again Mediocre. You spend the entire book waiting for a plot to develop. Reading the book is equivilant to vegging out to a mindless sitcom on tv."
2,Harlequin,"I wanted to try a book by Binchy. I gave up after 200 pages. It is not that it's bad, it's just not very good. The author does not seem to have a story to tell. The characters are not very interesting. Its difficult to stay engaged. I image Harlequin Romances to be like this. Some reviewers have called the book ""Chick lit"". Shit lit is a more appropriate. I cant image what Oprah was thinking recommending this one, other than she probably didn't read it."
4,Interesting and involved,"Tara Road was a great book! It started out slow and then picked up once the characters were more developed. The main character, Ria, is someone that I think women can relate to. I liked the fact that this book involved many characters all with unique situations. By the end of the book, I was rooting for some and wondering what would happen to each of them. This was the first book I read By Maeve Binchy and I will read more of her books. She had good conclusions on all of the open storylines in this book! If you like to read books that aren't too sappy but a mix of love, mystery, and humor, you would like this book."
5,I love Binchy's fast talking style,"I have read 4 of her previous novels and this one is typical of Binchy's style. Binchy is a great storyteller. You really get to know her characters and they make you feel involved in the story. Although, the book flows a little bit like a soap opera, i love how the reader gets dragged into each of the characters trials and tribulations. I agree with oprah's comments about Gertie. I can't believe she stayed with that no good Jack but I guess that is why I love to read books."
3,Poor Man's Mary McGarry Morris,When will Maeve Binchy learn? You need more than interesting characters to make a good book and while I may be being a little generous in saying that some of the characters were interesting I am not going to be when it comes to describing her writing. In parts her writing is really poor and amateurish and would suggest that the editor got a little bored while reading through. I know I did at times. The only thing to take from this book is the relationship that develops between a mother and a son. The relationship between mother and daughter is okay but nowhere as good as that that exists between Brian and Ria. If that is the only reason though to read it I would steer clear. Too long and nowhere near as good as any of Mary McGarry Morris's work.
2,"Tara Road was mindless, repetitive, uninspired waste of time","Having traveled to Ireland several times before with Maeve Binchy, I expected that this would be another pleasant visit there, filled with characters one cares for. Unfortunately, these characters are merely caricatures; so one-dimensional, unchanging and unsympathetic, you hardly care what becomes of them. All I could think about while reading it was ""Why was this chosen for the Oprah Book Club?"" I was certain it would eventually get better, or have some kind of creative, impactful ending, so I hung in there.There was nothing. No worse than your average Danielle Steel, or romance novel, but when you are expecting something more (due to Oprah's stamp of approval) it is a big disappointment.P.S. I had just finished reading the wonderfully descriptive ""White Oleander"" which may explain my disappointment. When Binchy referred to Rosemary's apartment for the third time, so tritely, as ""something out of a magazine"" I thought I'd faint!"
3,Captivating but too long!,This is a good book for when you have time to pass in a leisurely way and want to get lost in someone else's worries. It helps to take your mind off your own problems but other than that it is just an ordinary type of woman's story. The descriptions are nice but there are too may despicable characters. Overall one that is worth reading if you have the time.
3,good potential but insubstantial,"This is one of those books that you really wish were better than it is. The narrative is just intriguing enough to keep you reading to the end, but the characterizations are pretty shallow and there is some needless and not very subtle foreshadowing of events, which end up as a let down because there just isn't that much going on in the book. Time and time again I wished that the heroine, Ria, was less passive passenger and more captain in her own journey. Basically an enjoyable easy read but not one you're likely to remember in the long term."
5,The Best CD ever,"This band is the most hardcore roots rock band ever. If anybody gets a chance, please see this band. this CD is great, and please check out the follow up ""Uneasy"". Both are a must for any music lover. These guys really are great, but they like to take cushions that don't belong to them. Please buy this CD"
3,who's that bitch on the cover!?,"This is a great game - but c'mon - why did you have to put that dumb-a-- dopey s--- head yank on the cover - what's his name? - DEREK CHEATER??? Hopefully he'll get the EA curse and get injured ... I was hoping to see a real ball player on the cover - like MVP Justin Morneau, not this jerk-off - but I guess they put this out before the real MVP came out...Otherwise the game is ok - very challenging - never played these sports games before - I'm more of a FPS - but I got this because my fiance and I are into baseball. So we can't comment on this versus the other EA games. So far it's very interesting - and the graphics aren't that bad..."
2,worse then 2k6,i bought this game when it 1st came out and i thought it was going to be way better then 2k6 or 5 i was wrong the game has the same problems as 2k6 and it frezes all the time. i would not recommend this game for anyone it is a waste of money the only reason it got a 2 was b/c i got it so fast
3,Good Read,"Gann's style is diff in this story from Fate is the Hunter, a little less convoluted, easier to read. He tells a good tale, and was lucky/skilled enough to be both an accomplished sailor and pilot...his was the Albatross of White Squall (novie) fame. This tale is about an aging sailboat on the verge of extinction due to the new steam powered freight carriers of the day, and a likewise all but extinct sailor/owner of said sailboat, actually a barquentine, and his attempt to get freight and passengers(ea. w/ his own troubles) to CA and get pd for his troubles before all sink in the Pacific. The romance between Captain and passenger is a little sketchy, think maybe EG is better at fact than fiction, but still fun."
2,Speaking station doesn't speak,"I felt deceived when I receieved this product. The speaking mechanism is NOT activated by the train passing through the station. It is only activated by pushing the button. No one wants to sit there and push a button! The idea is to have a voice speak out when the train rolls by. I was very disappointed, since Brio toys are so expensive."
5,"Great product, almost half price",I bought this for my 3/4 ton truck. It is a quality product for almost half the price asked of a major local retail chain.
5,My favorite,"This is simply the best album they put out, IMHO. There isn't a single track I don't like, and I love many of them."
1,Very Dissatisfied,"I ordered this CD two months ago and still haven't received it. I contacted the seller via email asking for a refund. ""Doug's Records"" has made no attempt to deliver my order or contact me. I advise others to not order from this company. I'm very disappointed. I've been shopping on Amazon for years and I've never been ripped off."
4,"Sit back, relax and enjoy. This is great","One of the best, playing the best. This is a great CD to relax to, have dinner over or enjoy a romantic evening. With Clifford Jordan accompaning you cannot go wrong."
4,Historical Fiction,"Sometimes I expect too much from Historical Fiction, I was expecting more, especially after the mini series. It was a good weekend book, and ended up enjoying it. If you are looking for a historical account of the feud, this is not it. Written from the view point of a child it will draw you in as the tragedy unfolds."
5,Loved this book!,I do not read alot but love to read when I have time and this was a very easy book to read. I have always heard about the Hatfields and McCoys but never knew the whole story. After reading the book I looked up a lot of info online. I found the book very interesting and I highly reccommend.
5,Wonderfully written fictional history.,This book gave detailed and accurate description of Appalachian mountain life. It also brought up some interesting points about the Hatfield/McCoy feud.
5,What a great book!,"I just finished reading this book on my Kindle, in fact it's the first book I've read on my kindle. I loved the book. My father's family was from around this area of Kentucky and the feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys has fascinated me for years.The author of this book brings that feud to life for the readers. It's a book about a lot of killing, but that's what happened, so to leave the killings out would make the book pointless. The author also did her background work well with this book.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good historical read. :)"
5,The Coffin Quilt,"After watching a TV miniseries about the Hatfields and McCoys, I became very interested in learning more about them and the feud. This book was excellent in its narrative and helped me to better understand the two families and how their lives were intertwined. I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Good Read,I thought this was a well written book and just another chapter in the lives of the Hatfield and McCoy's struggle with each other. The story about the quilt was interesting and very sad.
5,a really good book!,"Fanny McCoy is at an election with her older sister, Roseanna. Then, Ro runs down to the creek with Johnse Hatfield, and the story begins! After he asks the beautiful McCoy girl to marry him, everything goes haywire. Threats, murders, and other frightening things happen between the two families, and it's all because of Roseanna and Johnse. Fanny is caught up in the middle of the confusion. The ending is really sad, realizing that nearly half of Fanny's family is dead by the time the story ends. But, if you read this book, you'll see how fascinating the feud was, and you'll learn more about Fanny's life. Read, and ENJOY!!!"
4,Well written,"I thought this book was well written, although it was difficult for me to read. I am a Hatfield and it was quite difficult to read you family as evil, dirty, dumb, and poor. I realize that is how the McCoys viewed the Hatfield family during the feud, but still difficult to read."
3,"Good, but not the best Ann Rinaldi book","The Coffin Quilt is a story about a family fued that went a little to far. The Hatfields and the McCoys are both large familys who have been in a fued since 1878, but becomes uncontrollable in 1882 when the main characters sister (a McCoy) runs off with a hatfield. This book is good, and definatly worth reading, but, for me at least, it is just too weird. Everybody is, or is going, mad. I found it hard to know the main character. It is a somewhat confusing, and very sad book, without a happy-everythings-alright ending. Overall, it was worth reading, but not exactly a 5 star book"
4,Coffin Quilt as Kentucky heritage,"The plot of The Coffin Quilt is a battle between feuding families, fueled by the romance between a couple that crosses the boundary. It is an Appalachian ""Romeo and Juliet"" story in the setting of the 1880's mountainous terrain of eastern Kentucky and West Virginia involving the Hatfield and McCoy conflict. Being of Appalachian heritage myself I find this is another well written and well researched Ann Rinaldi story."
4,Interesting,"I read this book because Ann Rinaldi is one of my favorite authors. I wasn't dissappointed with the Coffin Quilt. My favorite characters were Fanny, Rosanna, and Alifair (I hated her so much!)It was interesting when Ro ran off with Johnse hatfeild, but I wish that we got to actually hear what they were saying, instead of what only Fanny thought.Towards the end it got really good. I felt so sorry for everyone in this book! Especially Fanny: Everyone she knew was going crazy..."
3,WAY TOO VIOLENT,"I'm sorry, but way too many people were killed in this book, i know thats what the feud was about, but it practically pulled me over the edge, i couldn't read it. I need books to have a happy ending. I love Ann Rinaldi's writing, but all the guilt in this book made me very depresses. Read The Last Silk Dress, or Time Enough for the Drums, or Wolf by the Ears for a good read."
1,ummm,"If you really like books that have family fueds, killing, and a little bit of drama...this is it! In my own perspective, I did not really like this book. The transitions in the book are slow. That is one thing I didn't really like; Everything in each chapter sounded alike. This is definitly not my type of book but it may be for you."
4,Good Flash MX 2004 Book for both Beginners and Advanced,"The first thing I liked about this book were the notes and tips in each chapter. Someone could just read the notes and tips and get some pretty good applicable tips on Flash MX. The book begins with the beginner in mind. I found the chapters on sound and video extremely helpful. I too have not read the Actionscript part yet, but know it will help me understand object programming using Actionscript 2.0 better than I do currently! Thanks for a great book!"
2,For basic edition of Flash MX 2004 ONLY,"This book does not attempt to cover the full edition of Flash MX 2004. If you have the professional version of Flash DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! The book is titled ""The Complete Reference"" for Macromedia Flash MX 2004 but ""Complete"" it is not. The book is only 700 pages. I should have purchased the ""Bible"" series for this application. Osborne books are pretty much hit or miss... and you don't know until you try to look something up."
3,daimon,i had to use this book for latin class.....it took us this whole year to actually finish... translating this book was a little tedius and had no exact plot..yet it is great way to learn new latin grammer
4,Slightly formulaic story,"The Princeling is the third book in the Morland Dynasty. In this book, the story moves away from Morland Place for a while, as John Morland moves north to marry Mary Percy, and his sister Lettice marries a Scottish lord, Robert Hamilton. The sins of the previous generation come back to haunt the younger, as Jan Chapham learns secrets about his past.Sence the novel covers fifty years of history, all of them eventful, Cynthia Harrod-Eagles has a lot of ground to cover. At times it seems as though it's too much; the story jumps from event to event, sometimes skimming over the family's story in favor of touching on the major historical events of the period. But the story of the Morland family is still addictive, as ever, and it was interesting to me to see how the family interacted"
3,"Good story, lousy Kindle errors","Okay, I am hooked on Cynthia Harrod Eagles's series about the fictional Morlands of York. I think story-wise I would give the story four stars, but after an incredibly frustrating read on my Kindle app for iPad, I demoted it to three. The Kindle version was electronically scanned (I assume) so badly that following the story was a challenge. For example, there is a family - a rather important one at that - named Butts. The Kindle version constantly reads Buns! Also, so many sentences begin with ""Tie..."" when the real word is ""The...."" There are confusing italicized names - obviously a scanning problem. There were a few errors in The Founding, a few more in The Dark Rose, and an incredible number in The Princeling. If you like this series, buy in it paperback and save yourself the frustration. My paperback copy the #4, The Oak Apple, is error-free. I will not order Kindle versions anymore."
2,Beware the Kindle edition,The conversion to the electronic format was not entirely successful. It badly needs editing to get rid of the frequent and distracting typos. This story wasn't as good as the first book but I suspect I would have enjoyed it as a paperback.
2,Invest Your Money Elsewhere,"I was truly excited when I acquired this book. However, after spending much time painstakingly following code that promised much but produced nothing; I can with all honesty say use your resources more prudently."
2,Jeanious Hipster,This product came extremely over packed for an item like this--huge box for one small item. I guess I am not a 'hipster'--I do not like the fit at all.
1,Good advice for a robot,"I would only recommend this book to someone who has never even heard the word ""insulin pump."" And doesn't plan on going on it. This book was laughably bad. I appreciate that other people have been helped by it, but the advice consisted primarily of denial of issue. You are worried about body image and the pump? Don't! You'll feel better on the pump! You're worried about fashion and wearing the pump? Don't- it's easy! Are you worried that it will effect sex? Don't be worried- it doesn't! I've been on the pump for about a month and was hoping to find ways to make my life smoother with the pump. There's no advice here you wouldn't get from a pump website or salesperson."
5,Insulin Pump Therapy Demystified: An Essential Guide for Eveyone Pumping Insulin.,"The insulin pump demystified,I really enjoyed reading this book as it gave so much information in a very simple way. The tips offered were easy to follow and such common sense. I been on the pump for four months the this book has been a wonderful friend passing on all that I need to know. I have perused other books on pumping but I found the to be to technical and to difficult to read."
5,"By Ed Nielsen, author of Warriors & Classical Classics","This is an exceptional CD. I bought it primarily for the Light Cavalry Overture, excerpts of which are in every cartoon you've ever seen involving riders galloping on horseback. This is a great piece but the others on this disc are just as good. I can't imagine why it's no longer in print, but grab a copy if you can find it."
4,The Root of Rejection,"The book was on the mark, I always wonder why I reacted the way I do, this book told me why. I also gave one to my friend, and she got the answers to her questions also.This is a very good book to read, especially for people who have been rejected."
5,I wish I read it years ago,It is a well written and relatable book. many of the examples she illustrated were exactly things that had impacted me before. I was only upset that no one had told me of this book before!
1,I gave it away...,"I gave it away....it wasn't for me, it was for someone I knew, so I gave it them. I like Joyce Meyers."
5,Great bag,Fits my camera (Nikon D40X) well and doesn't look tacky. Sturdy and well-made. Feel free to drop your camera in this one :)
2,OK,The material of bag is strong and nice but was small in size and therefore my SLR camera could not fit.
4,Kid 2000!,"Very cool single release from the guys of Hybrid..Can't wait for Wider Angle to come out now...Kid 2000 is also included on that and also new and live tracks,,,ETC...Lovely"
4,these are excellent HARD mallets,"if you want mallets that enable you to play with some finesse and dynamic range, perhaps a softer end piece would be preferable."
5,Refreshing,"This was my first Garwood novel. I found the character of Sara to be sweet and lulling. I found myself impressed by her quiet inner strength and hidden capabilities and thoroughly enjoyed as the tenderhearted, unspoiled heroine came into maturity. What I loved most was that Sara was far from perfect and her husband Nathan loved that quality about her. It was refreshing to read a story in which the woman isn't a cliche hellion or a typical paragon of virtue turned wild by true love. Even as she grows and harsh reality lashes out at her, Sara remains trusting and honest. Even her cynical husband Nathan revels in her honest reactions when they make love. Throughout the novel, Sara remains Sara."
1,Total waste of time to read!!,The lead woman charater was WORTHLESS!!!!!!! I have never read a book about such a spineless ninny before!! DON'T waste your time reading this book!!!
1,Awful!,I hadn't read any of Julie Garwood's novels before and after this one I doubt that I'll pick up another. The book starts off pretty well and you'd expect the Hero and his lady to grow a bit in character and wisdom. NOT! All I can say is that the hero is a besotted idiot and the Heroine is just a twit!
1,I've Read Better,"It was hard finishing this book, it was so irritating. The hero was a jerk, who did not care about how his bride felt and liked embarrasing her, and the heroine is one of the biggest fluffheads I have ever read about. She sets out to demand a courtship from her husband and a period of time to get to know him better, and she ends up listing off her good points to him and trying to sell herself to him like a chunk of meat. She always contradicts herself, it becomes obvious that she does not know what she wants. Julie Garwood has written so much better."
2,No originality and dumb characters,"Maybe I've been reading too much Garwood, but this was the first book that really got on my nerves. The characters were like every other Garwood character - the naive female with a ""sprinkle of freckles on her nose"" and a giant brute of a man who is ""well-muscled and stands a head above every one else."" The plot was the same - two people from different backgrounds fighting each other and eventually falling in love, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sara seemed a bit dumb and overly whiny for the typical Garwood heroine - what kind of idiot would go about untying ropes on a ship (and how would she have the strength to do that anyway?)? She drove me nuts!I really do love Garwood books, though. I would highly recommend Honor's Splendour and The Prize because of their sweeter plots and characters. I particularly liked Royce in The Prize because he wasn't typically handsome and didn't think himself much of a catch, but Nicholaa saw past all that and loved and chose him."
5,It was the best I've ever read.,"Julie Garwood as usaual has managed to captivate her readers with another one of her delightful books. The Gift was so good that I could barely put it down for a minute, It is funny, intiguing and humuorous. I love Julie Garwood books!!"
5,A definite must!,"This was my introduction to Garwood,and haven't stopped reading her since. I laughed throughout the whole book. The little disasters Sara caused had me howling. I've read this story over and over again and always enjoy it. Yes, Sara is a little naive, but come on, in those days, ladies were sheltered from the world. Nathan is just what Sara dreamed of, and I enjoyed reading about them. Who doesn't secretly fanatize about their own knight on a white horse, or in this case, on the high seas. Read this book, and let yourself enjoy it for what it is, a funny, romantic getaway."
5,I couldn't stop smiling,"From the moment i start reading - I couldn't stop smiling. Sara was a little too naive for my taste, but Garwood didn't let her become stupid. And the hero ? all he tried to do was to stay alive when she was around. I couldn't stop myself from falling for them."
1,The heroine was a silly wining crying baby.I hated her.,"I have loved all of Julie Garwood's books, except this one.The heroine was an insult to all females on the planet. She cried atthe drop of a hat, was totally inept and and did nothing but whine andmake ""take care of me"" type statements. What I've always loved about Ms. Garwood's heroines was their self sufficiency, strength and willingness to take on responsibility. This heroine was just plain stupid and offended me with her constant histrionics. Beauty is only skin deep but ""dumb is forever"" and Sarah was dumb. I gave the book one star because, other than this book, I think that Julie Garwood is the most enjoyable of the romance writers, and I don't want to discourage her from going back to the type heroine that is interesting, funny and courageous."
5,Garwood makes magic again,"What can I say that other reviews haven't expounded upon?It took a guilty-pleasure trope (arranged marriage) and crafted it masterfully. The beginning chapter, with their first meeting alone, was touching and lovely.Also, one of the few novels I have read to mention menstruation as a reason not to have sex, and then make it utterly adorable anyway.A Garwood novel, out of the many, that I can revisit and still grin."
3,The Gift,Sara and Nathan are married as children to create peace between feuding families as ordered by the king. They meet again as adults when Nathan comes back to claim his wife. The book takes off from there and mostly takes place at sea with the heroine inadvertently causing havoc among the ship. Sara is Garwood's typical Mary Sue heroine. The story was pretty good with some cute LOL moments.
3,a disappointment,"I read the reviews before I picked the book up, and was really looking forward to it. It seemed to be the best in the series. It started out fine, but then got so ridiculous and tiresome, I was waiting for something good to come out of all this. I guess mostly I really got annoyed with the heroine, Sara. The reason I gave it 3 stars was for the humor, the way Sara and Nathan interact is funny, and you could say the end kind of makes up for the entire book; I cracked up on the last line. But otherwise, I was disappointed with how stupid and superficial it sounded. You can understand Sara up to a point, but that is all. She could have behaved differently if she was so mopey about Nathan. No one is perfect, but Garwood seems to like those kind of characters. Overall, not one of her best works."
5,Good!,"My favorite Garwood novel ever. Sara was very adorable. The dialogue between the two characters was funny and well written. Towards the end, you'll surely feel that Nathan truly loved Sara."
5,one of her funnist!,"I'm a big fan of Mrs.Garwood, and this is by far her Funnist book that I have ever read. The acciendents that Sarah gets into had me Laughing out loud. My mother came into my room several times to see what was so funny.If you like Julie Garwood's work, or any type of rommantic comady i highly recomened this book."
5,Very fun read,I love this book! It never fails to make me laugh out loud no matter how many times I read it. If you are looking for a fun and light-hearted romance then you will definitely enjoy this.
1,This girl was a moron!,I couldn't stand the heroine of this book. She was crying about one thing or another every two minutes and she was soooo stupid you couldn't bring yourself to enjoy the storyline. One of the worst romance books I've read.
1,Put me to sleep... but now without trying my patience first!,"I tried hard, really hard to like this book. After all I paid 8 dollars for it before boarding my plane. I like historical romances but this is among the cornier, least believable and carcicatured characters ever. If I had to read the male character say ""oh god"", ""my god"", ""dear god"" etc or talk about the lust in his loins one more time I would have thrown the book out the plane. And let's not even talk about manner in which the lead characters talk, completely out of place with the early 19th century. I suggest historical romance readers try Judith McNaught or Marion Chesney for their spunky, endearing characters with fun and lively plots."
1,Dumb...,"The heroine was dumb and so ""stereotypically"" female - whiny, ignorant of most things, etc. I like smart heroines. The plot was not too unique either - trap the female on the boat and she'll fall in love with ya."
4,Cant believe I liked it.,"Even though the h/h are exactly what I hate in romance books. She is ditzy and whiny, he is an arrogant a##. And yet I loved every minute of it. I practically require lol humor w/ my romance, and Garwood has yet to disappoint me on that score. She is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. Imho... she's brilliant."
4,"Look, I loved this book when I read it the first time...","This book was originally published in 1990. I loved it then and I'm not going to give a great book a horrible review for a pricing policy, but $7.99 for a reissue??? Really????If you haven't already read it, and you like a sweet tale told well, by all means pick it up. But with all due respect to Amazon, which I assume is at the mercy of a publisher's non-negotiable price on this one, don't feed the publishing house greed unless you're trying to round out your collection of keepers. Chances are your local library has this one, and the publisher should know it.Save your $8.00 for a NEW Kindle book, not a reissue."
2,Entertaining Reading for the Previously Unenlightened.,"Readers who have little background in the history of Custer and Crazy Horse will find Ambrose's book entertaining. From the historical viewpoint, however, it tends to romanticize the characters in a way which only adds to the myths that have surrounded them since their tragic deaths. Ambrose unfairly maligns General Crook. He also reiterates an oft-told tale about Frank Grouard's participation in Crazy Horse's death which smacks of the same sort of conspiracy theories that have plagued the Kennedy assassination and misled many Americans about that event. Despite these failings, most readers will find this book to be a valuable addition to their collection."
5,A thoughtful look at the clash of two cultures,It's rare to read a book about Native America that is not either distorted with Anglo-European prejudice or weighted down with naive sentimentality. This book deals sympathetically with the protagonists as products of their individual cultures while telling a story Americans never tire of hearing. This is Ambrose's best book.
4,"Two men, two cultures and a head on collision.","Ambrose has the ability to portray great battles through the participants' deeds and their motivations. What makes the Little Big Horn interesting in ""Crazy Horse and Custer"" is that after 21 chapters the reader is so ready for the fight and yet not without utter dismay when it's over. There will be no rematch! This book combines their engaging character traits with a crash course in the history of the West. Culturally speaking, this book is generally even handed. Both societies are examined and revealed in their greatness and folly. This is the best and most accessible place to start when studying the Indian Wars."
5,An American Tragedy,"Historical writing doesn't get much better than this.In parallel chapters, Ambrose presents the story of these two warriors, from their births to their final tragic meeting at the Battle of the Little Big Horn.Of course we know how the story ends, but it is still a fascinating study of these two great men, both fighting for what they believed in.What makes the tragedy even more profound is that we see so many places along the way where a different choice by one or the other of them could have resulted in a different outcome.If you want a good understand of the troubled relationships between whites and Indians at this time, this is a great book."
5,Wyoming and Montana here I come!,"What a wonderful balanced description of the complicated cultural clashes in the west. I think we can learn lessons today from this read that things are not always what they seem. I was sad when I finished this book same as I was whem I finished another Ambrose book ""Blood and Thunder""I am going to go back and revisit some of these historic western sites and be sure to fully listen to all sides of the story...enjoy this book!"
3,Crazy Horse and Custer,General Custer and Crazy Horse were always the first to charge the enemy and ask questions later. The word retreat was not in their vocabulary.
3,enjoyable read,"In this book Ambrose is not attempting to break new ground in historical research. He begins with an interesting premise; Crazy Horse and Custer are the two most recognizable figures of the Indian Wars. How did their lives lead to this intersection of men and historical event. This creates an interesting , if artificial framework for the events leading to Custer's Last Stand.Perhaps the most interesting thing to me was how both Custer and Crazy Horse were products of their cultures and were unable to understand the culture of the other. Custer in particular was doomed by the inability of the Army to understand the reality of life on the plains with the Indians and their insistence in placing incompetents in charge, and their refusal to listen to anyone who told them different opinions than what they wanted to hear. Perhaps just as jarring was their indifference to getting it right. Sound familiar anyone?An enjoyable read"
4,Crazy Horse and Custer was well balanced and fascinating,"Crazy Horse & Custer is a riveting double protrait of two of America's most intriuging warriors. I found the story to read much like a novel, with high drama, moments of humor and poignancy. I was particularly impressed with Ambrose's balanced critique of both Crazy Horse and Custer. He neither over-idealized the Sioux lifestyle nor glamorized Custer, but made fair criticques of both men while remaining non-judgemental. I read this book in about a two weeks and could not put it down. I loved it!"
5,Making History Come Alive,"This is the first Stephen Ambrose book I've read, and I really like it. His writing style is easy to read and makes the history come alive. There is so much here about the Sioux that I never knew, and the parallel lives of these two warriors makes for gripping reading. You'll learn so much about the America of the midi-1800s, what people in the East thought, and what people coming West expected. The hardships and the foibles, too.I will definitely be reading more Ambrose."
4,"Must read, entertaining history!","I really enjoyed this book! In my opinion, much better than his WW2 book, ""Band of Brothers"" I am unfamiliar with US western history & this account left me wanting to know more. Ambrose deals with both central characters with an admirable objectivity. Rare in this type of ""comparative"" history. The war & battle sequences are described in a clear & exciting manner. The heavier political, social, historical developments are presented without detracting from the entertaining & fast moving account. Ambrose has a tendency towards a delivery that is occasionally too melodramatic & an over useage of colloquial language that seems slightly inappropriate for a serious history. Over all I found the book very well researched, gripping & an absolute delight to read. Highly recommended for lovers of military history. Deduct one star rating for the inclusion of the worst, smallest & almost uninterpretable maps I have encountered in print. Why did you let this happen Mr. Ambrose?"
4,Stephen Ambrose Delivers Again,"Crazy Horse and Custer is an extraordinary story told by the late historian Stephen A. Ambrose. Ambrose does an excellent job of showing the paralel lives of these two historical figures and warriors of the nineteenth century. As with his other novels Mr. Ambrose did a great job of telling their story without hype, just relying on factual acounts, many unknown to me prior to reading their story, to re-enforce his story. No fluff, no hype, just the facts, allowing the reader to draw his own conclusions regarding the subjects. A fantastic historical journey."
4,Great Read and worth the Money,"Having seen Ambrose's commentary and ""Band of Brothers"" on TV, I hoped this book would be a good one and it did not disappoint. It was a little slow at the start with the rather long discussion of the early lives of both men... but it is a biography. As the author got in to the issues facing the Indians and their actions, I was really glued to the story. And he has a good write up on Custer's Civil War career without going over ground covered in greater detail by other authors. Same with events leading up to the Little Big Horn and the battle. Ambrose's writing style makes for an easy read too. And many footnotes and recommendations for books going in to more detail.Also provided a good background on the Indian issues versus the US government.Worth the money on this one!"
2,"Complete, but dull","I read this book a few years ago, and it hardly lingers in my memory. I suppose I would regard it much higher had I not made the happy mistake of reading Connell's ""Son of the Morning Star"" first. That book is much better both in content and writing. This is just another ""Last Stand"" book."
3,Refreshingly old,"Ambrose' style is mesmerizing, and the detail uncovered by his own research as well as pulled from others is impressive. Alas, he finds some difficulty in maintaining a consistent view of his main characters, and contradictions are numerous.Still, in spite of its flaws and many simplifications, an enjoyable read, likely to enlighten those have forgotten the price we were willing to pay to conquer the West. Moreover, a subtle reminder for the ones who still feel that the end justifies the means."
5,excellent potrayal of a dysfunctional family,"As a former social worker I found this book to be disturbingly accurate in its' portrayal of an abusive family. Children are so much more resilient than we give them credit for. Parents such as these who are self-absorbed and narcissistic are all too common. Fortunately, most such as Anna are forgiving. The unknown is far too frightening. Anna is a survivor and will prove to either be just like her mother or the opposite. Meg has struck a cord in this former social workers heart. I only wish she would write more!"
5,wonderfully written with strong main character.,"When I found out that an actress wrote a fiction story,I assumed it would not be that great.However ,this book was written so that it continued and led on,instead of getting boring,it was a book that made me feel like i was reading a diary,very personal,at times shocking.I know now that Tilly is a great author.Its like going beyond the overseen headlines of abused children and being abused with her,as strange as that seems.Changed my views."
3,"Bits of greatness, and still darn good","You have to get into a certain mindset in order to enjoy THE SPORTING CLUB, I think. This book seems very much to be a product of the time in which it was written. Many attitudes about masculinity, ranging from identity to violence to sex, get exposed and torn apart in subtly funny ways over the course of the bizarre plot. These are not the most lovable characters you're apt to find in fiction, but they are complex and believable and real. There a moments of deep and surprising humor that pop up and surprise you along the way, even if the ending feels a bit predictable. THE SPORTING CLUB is a midlevel work from a great author and overall is worth the time invested to read it."
5,Great Shoe - why did they stop making?,"I own or have owned 4 pairs. This has been my ""shoe"" for 7-8 years running. I wish they would start making again.."
5,Great,"This is a great brand, and a great shoe. The black version has a smoother leather, whereas the brown has a texture that is visible in the picture. The brown are a bit more casual looking. As with all of their styles, these are incredibly comfortable shoes. Very high quality."
3,New book with needed corrections,"This is a wonderful text for students in the entry level of nursing. However, many skills listed in the text are missing information or have conflicting information from the hardcover text also published by Delmar. I have used this text for 2 entry level courses and both courses have noted missing, incomplete or inaccurate data that will need to be updated, corrected and/or assimilated to correspond with the Fundamentals text that is designed as a corresponding text with this book."
3,Depends on what you need,"If you have any past knowledge of any of the techniques in this book, this book is wordy but descriptive. The pocket guide seems to be working better for a number of my classmates plus it doesn't weigh 20lbs. This book has all the information you will ever need on how to do everything from turn a patient to putting in IVs. If you are using it for advanced procedures then definately buy this tome - if you need it for easier things than the pocket guide will do!"
2,Not too great.,"This book was on my required text list. I opened it about 5 times total during 6 months. The pictures are terrible! Bad, bad lighting in all of them and are way too old for our times. I wish I hadn't wasted my money seeing as how the instructors had their own way of wanting the skills to be performed. If not required, do not waste your money."
2,not enough pictures in color,"For a novice just learning about identification of trees and shrubs, I felt the guide was lacking. Although the book contains a lot of written info, the diagrams aren't sufficient; thereare no colored pictures. The black and white ""tree silhouettes"" at the beginning are very interesting , and the drawings of leaves (in green )are adequate.After leafing through this booklet, I subsequently ordered the Audubon Society Field Guide to Trees which is excellent in its easy layout and colored pictures."
5,"great book, reasonable price","I have been looking for something along this line for a long time. I stumbled across a video where a man was telling how to use it, so I ordered one. After devouring the book for a while, I noticed it was well laid out and the format was designed for ease of use. It still takes a bit of looking to identify a tree, but with the number of trees there are, it is surprisingly simple. The Amazon price is very reasonable. I am now looking forward to a weekend of tree identification coming soon. I would encourage anyone who is interested in identifying trees to get a copy of this book. You will not be disappointed."
4,Field Guide,"This is a pretty good field guide even though I have to skip around through the pages to find things. (The color plates are not with the descriptions, which is like other Peterson guides) It has some photos with the descriptions, which is nice, and there are range maps."
2,"Very cool, but flighty","This phone is very very cool in its functionality. It does a lot of nice things, and by the features, the best phone I've ever owned.But it just is not solid. After a year of owning it, we are starting to periodically lose phone service, and it is definitely the phone, because an old analog phone works jsut fine. This phone just keeps getting into a state where it thinks one of the phones if off the hook, and nothing we can do except unplug it for a week seems to bring it back. Also, about 15% of the time the sound quality is quite poor and is subject to echoes, although normally it is fine."
4,"excellent resource, however ...","Consider ""Carpentry & Building Construction"" by the same author. It seems to include most of the content of ""Residential Framing"" plus much more."
4,Essential reference,Wonderful read on essential knowledge needed for home construction. Whether you are overseeing your own home construction or need the trade knowledge for you own work this book is a good source of information.
3,Needs written supplement,A few years ago I ordered a Berlitz German set. It had the transcript so I could read along or just listen to the tapes. I got a lot more out of it and it didn't need to be so repetative as this clearly is.Having written material would add visual input so you could not only learn to speak better by involving another sensory channel but also READ and spell.
5,learning basic czech,the lessons are straight forward repeating words until they start to sink in.it is not an easy language to learn especially at my age over 50!but it is well worth the effort and is apreciated by the locals.
3,skip the 10-CD introductory course,The method and teaching seem to be effective; won't know for sure until my visit to Prague this autumn. The first ten lessons in this package are the same exact recordings as the introductory 10-CD course. It would be considerate of the manufacturer to clarify which specific lesson numbers the CDs contain.
3,"OK, but lacking a little imagination","I'm already bilingual and have never used a language CD course. Their choice for the Czech-speaking man is very poor -- he doesn't breathe while speaking so it's very hard to hear what he's saying and it makes distinguishing consonants is very difficult. They should have chosen someone with a voice like the American narrator to do the Czech male voice. The female voice on the other hand, is good. The makers lacked a little imagination because they failed to use a variety of names in the lessons -- for example, they keep repeating the same street name in all conversations, when it would have been much more interesting to hear different names. In general, the amount of repetition of material is overdone in this system, because the whole idea of having it on CDs is that you can play to it over and over. They could have covered twice the amount of material with less repetition."
5,Outstanding compilation,"This is a classic grouping of great all time booty bass tracks. Seamlessly edited by DJ Magic Mike, once you put it on, you can't take it off!"
4,Great little Barbie box,"My daughter loves anything Barbie. This was applicable to this cute little box. It's adorable, practical, and compact. She uses it for her papers, such as her Cabbage Patch Kid birth certificate. For the many uses and great price I would definitely recommend."
1,what is this?,"After browsing Amazon for nearly an hour, this is the box I settled on. Imagine my disappointment when, 10 days after placing the order, I received the shipment and it is a completely different box! Still Barbie, which I could actually care less about, but its not even what I wanted. I'm new to online shopping so I'm trying to figure out how to contact the seller."
2,Shakespeare Barbie Play Box Como,I was very dissatisfied this iteam was smaller than what they say it is. But there is nothing I can do but not buy them agen.
2,"Good idea, poor execution","The book is a great idea in theory, but the proportions are just bizarre. For example, the cap sleeve sweater is designed to have really enormous armholes. These seem to be designed for a time when people wore their sweaters *very* big, but I prefer mine to actually fit. Some of the patterns might be nice if they had more modern tailoring, but I expect this book to gather dust on my shelf."
4,good content and amazon service,"I first got the book and some of the pages were upside down. After finally finding an amazon.com phone #, i was able to get it returned and replaced without paying shipping. That whole process seemed automated but friendly.The book is very helpful, it has a huge number of pattern sizes for differrent gauges and variations for basic sweater types. Not much for inspiration, but very good if you know what you want to make."
5,Good book for life!,"From infant to adult sizes. Every Sweater one could wear from infancy thru elderly is in this book. Different styles for different tastes,."
2,Not For Me,"this book was just O.K. it wasn't what I thought it would be. It was too difficult to adjust the yarn weight, size of pattern and needles. Too complicated, though I'm sure perfect for someone else."
3,Shaping not included,"I was excited to get this book because I already own and love Ann Budd's previous book, The Knitter's Handy Book of Patterns. I was dismayed to find shaping absent from all the patterns in this volume, which is the trickiest part of sweater design. I like fitted sweaters, but these instructions are only for basic, unshaped sweaters."
4,The Knitter's Handy Book of Sweater Patterns,"This book includes ""much"" information and data on sweater construction. It is a little confusing at first but will certainly add to my collection of knitting reference books."
2,Knit from the bottom up,Nowhere in the reviews is it listed that this book is for knitting from the botton up. Nuts!!
5,Great sweater patterns!,"Lots of options, lots of styles, and easy-to-read directions - a real plus for an advanced beginner like me. Can't wait to get busy and get knitting!"
5,Thanks.,"The book makes it easy to be able to figure how many stitches based on my swatch, using the yarn and needles I will use for the sweater. I will use this book often. Great companion to the Handy Book of Patterns."
5,Exactly what I hoped it would be,"This book is exactly what I hoped it would be and I'm thrilled to have found it. A source of basic patterns with all the gauges figured out? Whats not to like? This is a first class template/foundation/starting point for creativity. I have been looking for something like this for a long time. I can hardly wait to knit that cardigan for myself that I've wanted to knit for years. It arrived ahead of the promised delivery date and in perfect condition. I'm a happy customer, well, delighted, if you want to know the truth."
4,If you want to expand your ability on knitting sweaters . . .,I'm a basic beginner who has followed a few sweater patterns and now want to branch out to knit without a pattern or changing one. This book help me to understand how this can be done. I've taken the instructions and developed a few patterns of my own and it worked.Warning - the book falls apart quite soon. Poor book binding quality.
5,Great book,"This book and Ann's other similar book for hats, mittens, etc. are wonderful for those undisciplined manic types that can't ever follow a recipe exactly, or a knitting pattern made for a robotic zombie type of person. I always seem to want to change the yarn or the stitch pattern, and this book lets me do that and still come out with a lovely, wearable article."
2,Meek sleek,"2 1/2Stretched-longer-than-it-ought electro-pop may appeal to fans of the lighter side of ambient rock, rarely presenting more than sophisticated audio backdrops from the ride home of what you came to hear."
3,"Good story, bad dialogue","This is a heartwarming story and I was nostalgic for it, so I found it and bought it used. The script itself is good and the message (Elizabeth goes missing at Christmas) is even better.The only real negative here is the cringe factor associated with the ridiculous way that the voiceover actors speak and in some cases, act. It was as though the dialogue was written by somebody who hasn't been around teens since he or she was one himself or herself. The actors use words and phrases in ways that nobody ever has spoken before, yet you can tell that this language is supposed to be ""hip lingo that all of the kids use.""Aside from the Christmas special, there also is a Halloween special that actually is superior in every way to the Christmas one. So together, this is a solid release."
4,cant complaint,"no much to tell about, it just it simple fulfill my expectation.I would buy again if I could !!"
3,"Good, but could be better","These things work and wear well. My one complaint is the ""stickiness"" of the arch support insert. Can't it be made of a material that is smoother, more like the rest of the orthodic? When wearing these in shoes with socks (the major mode of use for me), my sock catches on the arch support. ThIs causes my sock to be pulled so tightly againt my toes that it hurts until the sock stretches. They offer a smoothe insole to be placed over the orthodic and I've tried it. While it does make it easier to get my socked foot into the shoe, it creates additional problems. One, it makes the shoe fit even tighter. Two, it squeaks when you walk."
4,cute and comfy,"if you want a sandal that's a little jazzed up, then this is the one for you. It's comfortable and a little dressy, but not too much that you can't wear it with a casual outfit."
3,"Good price, great music, less-than-fantastic recording","Its hardly worth criticising, considering the great price for this opera, but this has very poor sound quality. The recording seems to have picked up a good deal of distracting outside noise, charming in some cases and plain agitating in others. I was also a bit thrown off by the fact that the two discs were cut up into only 4 tracks, which doesn't really hurt anything, but does tend to confuse things from time to time.The performers are top-notch, and the performance is done well at the very least. No libretto, of course, and scant information on the opera/performance. If you haven't got much money, I'd recommend this."
2,Christoff completists only,"It's cheap, it's a rare opera, Boris Christoff is always worth hearing. But, this is not Boris Godunov. Rimsky's Tsar Ivan is a thoughtful, resigned, even gentlemanly character, and in fact he only enters the opera in the second half. You sense Christoff trying to get his teeth into something that isn't really there. To try to make this opera seem a star vehicle, the first half is brutally filleted; some of the cuts really jar, particularly when the compact 6 min Overture is here reduced to 3. Christoff is is commanding, but the rest of the cast are not - Schippers whisks things along in a lively, but cavalier fashion, but much detail is obscured by the slightly boomy and confused recording. That this opera can work, and contains powerful choral music as well as a host of minor character vignettes, is proved by Gergiev and his Kirov forces on Philips, released under the works real title, 'The Maid of Pskov'. It's full price - in this case, you get what you pay for."
5,.....as well.,"What the above review failed to mention is that the ""Muzurkas, Poems, and Impromptues"" book contains all of Scriabin's piano music excepting that which is contained in the ""Preludes and Etudes"" and the ""Piano Sonata's"" books. All three of these books are published by Dover and are not altered to death buy rotten editors. Comprehensive editions of composer's works are very valuable and often a huge oversight in the unusually chopy realm of sheet music. The book is also made as good as paperbacks get."
3,"Great music, poor book","To make it short, the music this book contains is amazing.But there are some mistakes in it...maybe I found THE piece which contains almost a mistake on each page, but it is still annoying.The pages are too thin and so not really enjoyable to turn. I am used to good thick paper and never realized that it could make a point. Now I know."
3,"Creative Approach, but Disappointing...","OK... Amy leaves her husband to be with Deb. Amy's daughter hates her, her twins aren't sure how to feel, and her husband takes it in stride. Deb feels slighted and seeks comfort with another woman. Amy finds a friend of her own. In my experience, it just doesn't happen that way. Kids being confused, I understand, but most husbands don't just roll over when their wife leaves for another woman.I applaud Calhoun's attempt at a different approach in this story, but it was a little unbeliveable. Other books of her's I've read have been a much better use of my time."
4,Cute!,"Won't look at craters on the moon, just a nifty, tiny, one eyed version of opera glasses! Really light and small, just the thing to carry anywhere, for a quick close look when needed!"
3,Not that great!,"Okay I recently got one for myself and wasn't to impressed by it's performance. I mainly used it for just recreational use(birds, houses, cars, etc..) it was okay but there are many better ones to buy. But if you want an inexpensive one that is decent this is fine, but I for some reason expected more."
2,confuzed young man,"I think the author is a very confused young man. As a Christian Scientist, I am appaled at the misunderstanding of what Christian Science is by both the author and his mother. Given that the Christian Science practitioner called by the family failed so siginificantly to help either of them, she should have been fired for non-performance of her job. I applied Christian Science--CORRECTLY--to heal a painful heel that a doctor told me I'd have to live with for the rest of my life. (The heel pad was destroyed. I was carrying a 35 lb backpack. Every step was agony. I healed it in 15 minutes by focusing on the Lord's Prayer, and on God's presence and power. Next day I hiked 7 pain-free miles still carrying the pack.) Christian Science DOES work when correctly applied--which it is clearly obvious the author and his mother and their practitioner didn't do."
4,Where is my Violin?,"In my opinion, Volume Two is a much better DVD than Volume One. Again, the DVD has a limited amount of episodes, only four. But the quality of these episodes is much greater.Episode One is a re-enactment of a Jack Benny radio show from 1953. The transition between the TV and radio program falls very nicely. Episode Two is a classic with Humphrey Bogart playing ""babyface"" Bogart, a crook and is being questioned by who else? Captain O'Benny. Episode Three is a celebration of Don Wilson's 27th anniversary working for Jack. I wonder if he will ever get paid? And, Episode Four includes a performance by Liberace. Not the most comedic episode and probably my least favorite of the group but the other three make up for this."
3,Get it out now,"It simplies work like a palm cradle to a palm device. With this cradle, you can simply drop the F601 into it and get the picture out easily (of course movie also do). The accompanying software integrate with this seamlessly and work just fine. In addition to that, using the cradle to charge back the battery should be better (I guess it is much better power managed). The final reason why you should buy this because F601 is designed primary with the cradle so the USB connection is at the bottom, without the cradle you will need to put the DC flat, hoping you won't make a scratch.While money already goes for the F601, why don't you hesitate to get one. It's simply another palm cradle already attached to your PC and make you get the picture out easily and the equipment better linked."
5,more than just a cookbook,I was so excited to see that this cookbook not only included recipes that are not found in most ethnic cookbooks but also included so much about the people and places that they came from. How fun it has been and we have only tried 4 things so far. And they have been delicious.
5,Best cookbook I've ever owned!,"I've had this cookbook for ten years. It's been dragged all over the world with me and I think I've actually tried over 60% of the recipes. Every meal has been delicious; beating-out ""gourmet"" recipes that take twice as much time to prepare. It's a wonderful way to get to know the cuisine of the real people of other cultures, too. I wish they were all written like this!"
4,Very Good Mystery,"This is a very well written story about a man who is learning how to put his past behind him, and a young woman who seems to need to learn about her past so she can get on with her future. Kelly is a very likeable man who is working as a security guard for a flea market. It's a good job for a former police officer who is trying to get over the death of his wife...until he runs right into a murder victim. As he tries to help his friends in Indian Creek stay out of jail, he also tries to find out who murdered Anna, a flea market vendor and resident of Indian Creek. Will Anna's daughter be the one woman who can help him move on? Will he be able to work with his former partner on this case? This is a fine mystery you can help solve if you pay close enough attention, and I enjoyed every minute of the challenge. I look forward to the next book in this Indian Creek, Texas series!"
1,Need Better Packaging,"As you can see by other customers reviews of this type of equipment Amazon has a problem they need to adress. The 109 lb. box was totaly destroyed before ever reaching me. UPS attempted to re-box it but I had no way of knowing if all the peices arrived intact, I had to refuse it."
1,disappointed,after 2 months the bike knocked so much i couldn't hear the radio. this is my first schwinn. i have had two other makes of recumbant bikes which each lasted about 1 year. it appears they are all throw aways except this was the worst.
3,trice,"the ends on the leg braces arrived cracked twice. Still waiting for third replacement, after two months waiting"
5,A good choice.,"We bought this a few month ago and was very pleased. Assembly was easier than I had expected and all the tools that you need are included. All of the parts were there which surprised me as the box was pretty well battered from the delivery company. The bike works well and so far there have been no problems. It is heavy. I was very impressed with the quality seeing that it was made in the People's Republic of China which is well known for shoddy work. A bit over-priced for a Chinese product but I guess that's to be expected from the new world trade economy we're faced with.It won't make you get on it, however, but once you do you will get a good workout."
4,Amazon obviously listened to customers...,"REceived the bike with no problem!! Perfectly packaged, and delivered by a freight company rather than UPS, so it was a pleasant suprise!! Nice bike, and Amazon was great in its timely delivery and excellent product!! Also, the shipping cost was awesome considering the price of gasoline!!! Thanks Amazon!!!"
4,Nice purchase,"The Schwinn 203 was rather easy to put together. About an hour by myself. The only thing not real mastered yet is the computer. Wish it had more button options, but would rate it good for the price. Easy delivery, no need to be home and sign for delivery. ****"
5,The Perfect Reclining Bike,"I bought this bike in 2007 after having a fusion in my back. I had researched other recliners in depth, and read that this had all of the necessary functions with good craftsmanship. I am so happy with the bike, even after 2 years of constant use.The assembly took about 2 hours with 2 people, but we had no glitches putting it together. The instructions are very straightforward as all of the bits and pieces come mapped out and wrapped sequentially in the order that they get assembled. The bike also functions perfectly. It's a smooth ride; absolutely quiet; the seat is well-padded and very comfortable on my toosh and my back; the seat adjuster is easy to move; the display has many different functions to choose from, and is easy to operate; the drink holder is handy; and, the bike really doesn't take up that much room as some of the others I saw. This is a great deal for a great product!!"
4,Very Good Product,Easy Instructions. Easy to Assemble. Good Quality and colors that can fit in almost any setting.
4,Love it,This bike is a great fitness investment. I especially like the lumbar support on the seat back. Be careful using the heart rate monitor though. It tends to give a reading that is about 20-30 beats per minute lower than it should.
5,Exercising made fun,"I have had my Schwinn Recumbent Exercise Bike (203) for almost 2 years. I love it. Need I say LOVE it again. I Lost alot of weight starting 5 years ago. But I did it sensibly with life change. I eat differently, exercise and am active. Which I cannot say that about my life before 5 years ago.This bike makes it fun to exercise. It is easy to use. I read through the instructions so I could use the different programs. It has some great ones with different levels so if you are just starting out it makes it easier for you. And as you build your stamina then you can raise your level or program.I pop in a DVD and I get started, before I know it my time is up."
4,Schwin 203 Bike,The bike is excellent no problems once the bike was built. However your first work out is putting the thing together!! Took about 2 hours & hooking up the electrics needs a second set of hands as it is cumbersome trying to hold the bike & hook up the electrics at the same time.
5,Schwinn 203 Recumbent Exercise Bike,"The Schwinn 203 recumbent bike is an excellant product, with the quality and durability of ones I have used at the gym. I especially enjoy how quiet it is!I was a little concerned about the shipping after reading about some problems in other reviews. But my package arrived earlier that predicted with no damage whatsoever. The shipping company even called to tell me when it would be delivered out to my house.I was extremely pleased with the entire purchase process."
4,Only one thing wrong,"I love the exercise bike, it is quiet and smooth. It offers a wide range of resistance and is comfortable. But, the monitor does not have any backlight in it. Less of a problem for me, but may be a concern to others, the seat does not slide forward far enough for shorter people. Mom has to use a pillow behind her back. She is 5'3"""
5,"The bike is excellent, but beware of delivery!","This bike is amazing...easy to put together...quiet....and easy to use. I needed a bike to use every day since I had my knee replaced. This is the bike for me!! However, the delivery was upsetting. The delivery man refused to put the package on my porch. He said he had to leave it at the curb....I live on a very busy street where there are two schools. I begged him to please just put it in my yard. He claimed it was just too heavy, but finally, I convinced him to leave it on my porch. It was quite an experience! But, now that the bike is in my family room, and riding it daily....I am really pleased with the product!!"
3,surprise-220 volt for the US,"Was happy to get another Ionic Breeze, but was surprised that is was 220 volt, and came with a black box to convert it to 110 for here in the United States. Later bought another from Office Depot, and it was 110.Unit came from Florida,and last I heard they were still part of USA.So far no problems, but keeping an eye on it!Pat"
2,OVERPRICED AND DON'T WORK!!!,"I own 2 Quadras and live in a small apartment (700 sq ft). I've been using my units for over a year. I was hoping to see a significant reduction in dust on my furniture. Not so. I still dust 2 times a week and see no difference from before I owned them. And QUIET! HARDLY!!! After thoroughly cleaning and turning the units as per the instructions, the units continue to HISS and SIZZLE continuously. I actually turn them off when I leave the apartment now as I am afraid they are a fire hazard! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!I'll NEVER buy another Sharper Image product."
2,noise,I can not stop my Itonic Quadra from making this loud hissing sound. I keep taking the bar out & cleaning it but the sound continues. What can I do?
5,Absolute Must Have Appliance,"I have the Quadra Ionic Breeze and several HEPE air filters. I also have several smaller bathroom-size Ionic breezes around the house. They make a BIG difference in the quality of the air. Even with my HEPA filters, the ionic breeze pulls lots of junk out of the air. This may be expensive but it is worth it."
1,Waste of time and money,"The air purifier was damaged when it arrived. One of the pins that connects to the ionic collector was bent, so the collector did not fit into the housing. I bent the pin back, but the purifier started to make noise soon after plugging it in. From experience, we knew that the problem would only get worse, so we had to return the purifier."
1,Dangerous! Research before you buy!,"Just do a quick search online for 'Ionic Breeze"" and look at the news stories that you find. The dangers of this 'air purifier' drove Sharper Image into bankruptcy. I can't believe that Amazon is selling this product.Consumer Reports determined that this unit produces dangerous levels of ozone and can cause permanent lung damage!Don't believe me, do your own research!"
5,Sharper Image Air Purifiers ARE Air Purifiers,"I have asthma and allergies...this product works great for me & my family, and has for almost a decade. Highly recommended for air purification...if you want a dust-free house, get a maid!"
1,Consumer Reports Second Worst Rating,"Of 19 models of air cleaners tested, the Ionic Breeze came in second to last place, along side the Honeywell ""Environizer"" (another electro-static model), in terms of performance.Tested at it's higest operating level against the top 2 air cleaners: the Friedrich C90A and the Whirlpool AP45030HO, both of the top performers move over 25 times the air ON THEIR LOWEST SETTINGS. Further testing revealed these air cleaners to be almost completely silent on their lower settings and using only as much power as a lightbulb.In my opinion, you should steer clear of the Ionic Breeze, not only for perfornace issues, but because it the price to manufacture these units is about 1/20 what they're charging. There is currently a class action suit being filed agaist Sharper Image because of concerns over excess ozone emissions not properly reported by the manufacturer."
5,The Best Air Purifier by Sharper Image,"This is an excellent Air Purifier by Sharper Image, realy works silent, and great air quality, super eazy to clean and operate. We love this product, and recommend it."
1,i do not know,"I am typing this on January 18, 2007....and I still do not have either of the baseball caps in my possession. But of course the money has been deducted from my account! How lovely!"
5,Do You Like A Secret Misson Read This Book!,"Do you ever wonder what is behind you neighbors gate? If you do, then read The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett. Well, in this book Emily finds out what is behind her neighbor's gate. I like this book because I am a curious person and I like to figure things out. Emily finds some very interesting things in her secret garden. Find out what happens next when you read this book."
4,A interesting read,"The history starts in the India. There was born a girl with the name Mary Lennox. Her parents died when she was a child and she went to live in England with her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven and his son Colin.I recomend this book,it's fun and you are going to have a good time."
5,Continuatioon of my June 16 review,"Somehow not all of my June 16 review got posted. Here's the rest of it:...and Colin also gets well for the first time in his life. Even though you know how hte book will turn out long before the end, it's still enjoyable to read, espicially in the parts where Dickon and his sister, a servant named Martha, speak the broad Yorkshire tongue. It also teaches a valuable lesson, which may sound corny but is still a good one: think about wonderful things instead of bad things and you'll become a much better person. A wonderful, uplifiting classic to be treasured and enjoyed many times over."
4,a good read,"This book by burnett was an interesting read and I enjoyed it. The characters were believable and they were interesting. Her presentation of their interactions and the secret garden was well done and kept your interest. It was an enjoyable read.J. Robert Ewbank, author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,#4's book review,"The Secret GardenDo you like mysteries?Do you like secrets? You can read The Secret Garden by Frances H. Burnett. It is about a 10 year old named Mary who is a,sickly,sour,and ugly little girl who goes to a mansion where doors are locked and a mysterious crying is haunting the house. Mary hears about a secret garden hidden for ten years. Will she find the garden? Read the book to find out.This book is for 9 years and up."
1,"No illustrations, small print","Had purchased this as a gift for my granddaughter, but had to return it, as the print is tiny and there are NO illustrations!"
4,Excellent,"Normally I read the book before seeing the movie, but in this case it was different since my first viewing with Dean Stockwell as Colin. As always the screenwriters didn't feel the book flowed enough to make a good movie, but in this case they were wrong. Although both movie versions were good as well as enjoyable, the choice of the screen writer to overplay the ""mystery of magic"" instead of allowing the flow of the beauty of magic to be explored. I highly recommend this fascinating and colorful journey into the recovery of madness by way of the healing beauty of nature."
3,Great book.,"A must read book. A great book for free. Had read it before, but was just better as a ebook. Kept me interested."
5,Wonderful book,I loved this book. I couldn't put it down and wanted to keep reading it. It is great to have quality books available for the Kindle that are free of charge.
5,"This book was great, I really like The Secret Garden",I really loved this book becuase it take place in India.I think I will recomen this book to anyone at school becuase this book is fantastic.Also becuase theres the movie of The Secret Garden and I think for me is a great movie and book.This book is fun to read and to see the movie.
5,It was a great book!,"This book was about a young girl who's parents died of a disease,and Mary was sent to live with her uncle. Mary made friends with her cousin and opened a new relationship with Colin (cousin) and his father. Read this book if you like classics."
2,The Secret Garden,"The secret garden is wonderfully story. She had hope and found secret garden.Mard had no family in India, so she went home to England like her uncle, Mr. Archibald craven, she was told that he lived in big oldhouse in the country, and that he was a hunchback.Coiln Crober thought dead and I don't walk, but she receive hope and he is walk and he is father saw. The nature of force great.Mary and Coiln change and secret garden grow up because nature power. the have nature clean air and don't see big power"
3,The Secret Garden,"The Secret Garden By:Frances Hodgson Burnett The Secret Garden starts out in Misselwaite Manor. The main character is a girl named MAry Lennox who is a orphan that nobody likes because she is stubborn, very mean, and ugly. She has no respect for anyone.She lives with her Ayah that feeds and clothes her. Later on in the book when her Ayah dies of sickness. Mary gets put into a orphange. A little boy, Basil, that lives in the orphanage makes fun of her name and gives her the nickname Mistress Mary, Quite Contrary. Then she goes and lives with her uncle. I think this book is okay, but it kind of drags along. I give it three stars.By:Jolena Mcdaniel"
1,The Secret Garden,"This edition is printed on really cheap, unappealing paper. I can't imagine anyone wanting to give this version of a children's classic as a gift, or even to read from it to a child yourself."
1,Weird,Hi there is a memorial service Virginia and the LORD looks at targeted by the heart of an important role in
4,An excellent read!,"I thought this book was great. I stumbled across it by accident in my school library and decided to read it because I had seen the movie, which i thought was great also.I loved the detail of the book, it's setting in england, the spooky old manor with it's ghostly noises, but I esp.liked the charactersI loved mary's feisty, sour attitudeIf u want to revive your imagination then read this classic; but beware of the thick yorkshire language in it, it took me some time to get used to it"
4,The Key to the Secret Garden,"Have you ever meet someone who can't walk? Have you ever wondered what was behind your neighbor's backyard? The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett is a book about a spoiled little girl who finds a garden.I liked The Secret Garden because during the night, Mary heard ghostly noises! I felt scared and wondered if there was a ghost!What will Mary find in the garden? If you want to know read the book! The author tried to share that impossible things can come true and don't believe everything you hear!"
2,The Secret Garden,"This short novel was somewhat enjoyable and an easy read, but it had a very predictable story line. I was waiting for some major revelation or surprise, but the action just quietly came to the expected end. Then again, so go most of our lives, which generally wouldn't make for exciting reads either."
4,Classic Story,"This is a classic story,after watching the movie was curious about the book.The book turned out to better than the movie.My wife also enjoyed reading this book."
5,Exciting and full of suspense,"This was one of the best books I've ever read. It never got boring, really, and I was always hoping Colin would be happy again. Mary's uncle, the hunchback, seemed to be a very strange man. When ten-year-old Mary and her cousin Colin start spending time with one another, it seemed things brighten. It's a long story to tell everything that happened in this review, but one thing, I give this book five stars and once you read it, you'll probably give it five stars too...that is, if you know what a good book is."
3,The Secret Garden,Easy read. Good for young people as it is about young people. Light hearted for most of the book and holds your attention. It is set in England in the early 1910s and provides good visuals of the countryside in your mind. It is empowering to young people and a bit of a mystery. The lead is a young lady and she has great adventures.
4,Very Readable,Excellent story which is timeless and a relaxing read. This is a book which eventhough may have been read before can be enjoyably reread.
4,The Secret Garden,"The Secret Garden written by Frances Hodgson Burnett is a nice little story about Mary Lennox who has to live with her uncle in England. While she starts finding friends she discovers the secret Garden which was locked for ten years. She spends a lot of time in the Garden and brings it back to life.She discovers more in this strange place she lives in, she finds her cousin. Everybody at Missletwait Manor thinks he is sick and not able to walk, Mary shares her secret (the garden) with him and he starts recovering from the sicknes he build in his head.Frances Hodgson Burnett wrote about the journey of a little girl that had forgotten how to be a child and rediscovered the joy of playing. In my opinion she used for this Novel to many detailed descriptions of flowers, but the story still stays in the front."
5,I still love it!,"I loved reading this book when I was a young teenager and found it a real treat to read again, even though I'm a few years older, sigh. Can't wait until my granddaughter gets a wee bit older so she can read it or maybe I'll start reading it to her as a bedtime story."
5,A lovely's child's book,"I loved ""The Secret Garden"" when I was younger. It is charming and well-written. It would make a fabulous gift for a young girl who loves to read."
3,It's wonderful for those who belong!,"Well, I think this is a very good book, but the reading level should be changed.It should be for children of 5-9, or an English beginner. I was 10 when I read this book and I found it not very amusing. I am now 11 and I have belonged to another world. Just to note: Children over 10, in this era, whatever nationality, should begin reading books about political intrigues, the art of war,and philosophy, especially those living in a chaotic country like mine. For children below 9, I think, this is truly a wonderful book."
3,can be scary for some kids,"I bought this for my 8 year old but figured I'd better look at it first. The beginning is quite frightening; descriptions of death, illness, abandonment, loneliness, the wild moors, etc. I don't think I want my daughter to read it until she is older. I told her about the book and she actually asked me if it gave me nightmares! I recommend that an adult skim the book first to decide if your child can handle the story. Remember kids read more slowly so the scary beginning part will last longer.This book is not for a sensitive child."
1,Disappointed again,I ordered this book along with Little Women. Both books are printed on very poor quality paper and the few illustrations contained within aren't worth the effort it took to print them. I rarely have to return anything to Amazon but I returned both books immediately.
2,I Too Read It As a Child,"So many of us have not passed childhood by without reading the story of Mary. I remember holding the lovely green book and getting ready to dive into a treasure trove. After all I had seen the movie and I enjoyed the movie, The Little Princess...so I felt like I knew what I was getting into at 8 or 9...Well I don't know if anyone elso felt this way but the central character is a spoiled bratt as is her cousin. That is bareable, but the way the author refers to the natives of India and to the servants in England tends to be negative. I clinched my teeth at the tone that was echoic of Mary herself and put the book down.Maybe it was because I had parents who drilled history into me and tuned me to notice biases current in different eras and societies? No matter how I sensed it, I just thought to put that out there as food for thought. Other then that I think the idea of a Secret Garden is brilliant and the author created a masterpiece...if not slightly tainted by her tone."
3,OK.,This was an OK book. I read this book in my literature class and it was as I said: OK. I don't reccomend you getting this book but don't don't reccomend you getting this book. (You know what I'm saying)? Any way...... It was OK.
3,Secret Garden - H. Kleine,I loved the book because it's a cute book and other people might like it. If you're older kid you might like it and the teachers and the parents might like it too. If you like reading about this parents and before died she was a spoiled kid. They always dress her and made her food and when her parents and when her parents died she went to live with her uncle. And her uncle's wife locked her in a room and a maid dressed her and fed her and then she went out to find some one to play with but a secret garden. I probably rate this book a 5 between 1and 10. The age group from 16-18 years olds might like this book.
2,The Secret Garden,"Before I read this book I thought it was going to be good and exciting, but as it turned out I thought it was kind of boring. It was sad that Mary didn't feel loved and she felt by herself. Another thing that I didn't like was that the story wasn't very exciting. It had bearly any excitment, pretty much the only that was really exciting was when Mary found the key and finally opened the Secret Garden. Besides that, the story just didn't really flow. There were a few parts that made me say ""wow!"" but not many. This book had it's ups and downs. Over all, I think this book wasn't very great, and I wouldn't suggest reading it."
3,A Good Classic,"This book is so sad in so many ways. It finally gets interesting and the pace picks up. Till the end you carry away hope and the joy of friendship. A classic that takes a little extra effort to get into, but worth it."
5,"Young for me, but a fun read!","I really enjoyed this book. Well written, of course, being written a while ago, but it is interesting, nonetheless. You can almost feel the curiosity of all the English characters concerning this ""Indian"" girl and how she lived, as we Americans don't know much about the inner workings of the English colonization of India, nor do we know much about Moors. Some of us never knew that the sun shined in England!Jokes aside, it was a book obviously created for juveniles, but it is not bad brain candy if you just want a fun book to read."
1,I hate this book...,"This is supposed to be a classic? Not with these three obnoxious lead characters. Take a bratty girl, have her meet up with her obnoxious, long-lost, sickly cousin and throw in an intolerably polite green thumb, write them in a story about a garden that the Hunchback of Notre Dame locked away because it reminded him of his deceased wife, and write in the most annoying, condescending style imaginable. Then sell it and have people call it a classic. Oh yeah, have I mentioned that the dialouge is the worst I have ever read, the conflict is resolved in a childish, immature way, and the movie adaption isn't really much better? No? Okay, you just heard me say all that.If you want some good books...The Lord of the Rings TrilogyHarry Potter (Except maybe the fourth book)Eragon/EldestAngels & Demons/the Da Vinci CodeThe first three Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy books"
1,The Secret Garden,"TheSecret gardenThis book was pure disappointment.This book was definitely not exiting and I can tell you why.First, people who like fun action packed books don't by this book. This book didn't match my type of liking, It was very dull because it had no exiting parts. The only exiting part was when They found the secret garden. The author of The Secret Garden explained the characters very well. She caught the"
1,DULL DULL DULL,"This is really disgusting! How could a child read this crap! I thought children where supposed to be encouraged to read, but this book, doesn't support that fact. A Little Princess is a little better, the story moves along at least, but the story of the secret garden is like a lame side story in a B movie."
5,Great Book,This book way one of those books you cant stop reading! you have finish this book the min you start reading it!
2,Boring,"This is an extremely boring book! Judging from the cover, i thought this story was going to be very exciting and myserious! After the first hundred pages, absolutely nothing had happened! Hoping something would happen i continued reading on, sadly nothing did happen! I am disappointed to announce this book is a waste of time... do NOT waste your time reading it! It is just some stupid book about kids that sniff dirt! I would rather sit and stare at a wall then read this boring book again!"
5,The Secret Garden,"Very good book, no matter what your age is. Read it when in school and still enjoyed it as if it were the first time I read it."
4,A classic story for kids about possibilities in life,"I had children in my reading group read this story and discuss it. Everyone found it interesting (though our books varied - some had the original language of the area while some were in more modern language) and we all enjoyed seeing characters change because of someone's influence in their life. Just goes to show that one person DOES have a huge impact, whether you believe it or not."
5,Wonderful book,"One of the best books ever written. Great for the young, in between and old. Great illustrations. The book is large but that does not take away from the story. Highly recommended for every household and a must for every child to read."
5,The Secret Garden,"It was a great book.It was pure,innocent,and childlike.I recommend it to the person who loves books that make you feel calm and peacefully happy."
4,liked it,I enjoyed reading the book and also have watched the movie on TV. I also read portions of this book to my grandchildren.
2,Abridged,"I purchased this book and CD thinking it was the full, unabridged version. I was disappointed when it arrived to see that it was an abridged version (I don't think that was very clear on the purchase page). Anyway, this is good for a very young kid, but not for older ones."
5,A Great Book,"This book was pretty good.It has a few complicated words,but I can understand them.Children who aren't too young should buy it."
5,Good book,I read it with my fourth grade class. I love it. So did my class. My mom downloaded it on my kindle fire HD.
5,So much better than the old movie!,"After all these years, I decided to read this book, after years of loving the movie, not thinking the book would be as good (in my youth). Wow, couldn't stop reading this. A first rate real good, feel good book! Now I'll need to read the other free standard classics!"
3,Relaxing read.,The book is an easy read and so innocent with its' main characters! It was good enough to want to finish it.
5,The Secret Garden,Mary Lennox ia a very dull child in the beginning but when she get sent to Misslthwaite Manor she learns about respect and there's more to life than just laying around and being lazy. She also learns about her uncle and her family's intrest's.
4,Delightful fiction for the family,"This classic engages and captivates the reader from the beginning. Everyone loves to uncover hidden secrets. The main character is an orphan girl called Mary whose curiosity, intelligence and unpretentious character not only win the hearts of all around, but help her to solve the mystery of the Secret Garden."
5,one of my favorite books of all time,"One of my favorite books of all time, a simple, yet Romantic and Gothic, story about a spoiled, orphaned little girl that goes to live with her dark and cold widower uncle in his massive mansion. She discovers the garden he has locked up, and as she brings it back to life, she grows and changes, as does the mysterious, invalid boy she has discovered. So much of this book imprinted on me: the gothic, tragic romance for Archibald Craven, the forbidden garden returned to nature then brought to life, the enormous house, the mystery and beauty. One of my favorite books of my childhood, one of the few that I can still love as an adult. Burnett wrote simply, magically, beautifully, and timelessly. Love, love, love this book."
5,Seeds the child's imagination...,"This has always been one of my favorite books since childhood. When I read my first story in this book it gave me so much inspiration to use my imagination as a child should. A child's imagination is so real! This reality soon takes the form of abstract, which paves the road to anywhere he wants it to go - or not..."
4,The secret garden,Good book to purify your soul. Very delightful reading experience. A happy journey to go together with the children through the garden.
5,And delight reigneth!,"Ages 9 and up the cover informs which at age 50 allows me in on one of the most beautiful reading experiences of a lifetime. It is romantic in the best sense of the word: one thinks of Blake's ""to see a world in a grain of sand,"" or in this case in a secret garden. For this is a romance of two odd, solitary children who fall in love--not with each other--but with the world. To grow from isolation to friendship, from solitude to joy, from loathing of self to delight in nature, the themes are standard but deeply felt and movingly evoked in simple but lovely prose. The world is beautiful, once wrote Thomas Merton, to remind us we were originally meant for paradise. The Secret Garden is another such reminder. ""I'm going to live forever and ever and ever,"" Colin famously exults and in this great book for children and adults he does and he does and he does."
5,Excellent book,An extraordinary classic both children and adults can enjoy. Everything from the mystery of the crying to the excitement of Ben Weatherstaff finding the children was all astounding.
4,Reminescent reading....,"Love the story. Read it as a child. However, I bought this one for the beautiful pictures it was suppose to have but they did not appear on my kindle. Disappointed about that...."
3,The Secret Garden,"I have read this book many times and do enjoy it still but I really only wanted to see if it was illustrated, which it is not, unfortunately. I think children like illustrations."
4,The Secret Garden,"I downloaded this book onto my phone and read it during my lunch break at work. It was a splendid little read. It made me yearn to immerse myself in nature -- to sit silently and observe as well as, appreciate God's handy-work. A wonderful distraction and a perfect story to pick up and put down day after day. I only wish it would have continued a bit longer."
2,THIS is good formatting?,"This is a wonderful story, written by a first-class writer. Too bad the Kindle staff didn't care enough about it to do a first class job.The irregularities in the text indicate that the book was scanned in and not very carefully vetted for errors. The dialogue is sometimes not separated by speaker, the punctuation is off, and there are mistakes which indicate that undecipherable bits of the scan were filled in not by reference to the original text, but by the editor, who didn't care whether it was faithfully reproduced.It's almost unreadable for an adult who isn't familiar with the book. It IS unreadable by any child.And to think that I paid FOR this. 99 cents. Because I believe what Kindle said about being tired of poor formatting, and how they'd taken pains to fix it. Lies, all lies.This"
4,Sweet,"I was curious about this book, and pleasantly surprised. I kind of enjoyed the lessons of humanity. I was wondering if it was origionally written for young people."
5,The Secret Garden,"Pleasant book for teens. I so much enjoyed her other books, thought I would read this one. I did like it and I recommend it."
5,Secret Garden. Gewa violin case.,"I ordered some items from Amazon.com .I am satisfied about what Amazon.com treated to the customers : Fast , Secure and somewhat not expensive. In the future , if I need ssome stuffs I will order to the AMAZON.com . Chanh Nguyen"
3,Not my cup of tea,"I know this book is a classic and most of my friends that have read it love it. I, on the other hand, was very bored and wanted to stop reading. It did pick up toward the end, which is why I ended up rating it a three. I saw one of the movie versions a few years ago and loved it. I was looking very forward to the book, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations."
2,ThE SeCrEt GaRdEn!!!,I thought the Secret Garden was a Great classic!!!!!! I enjoyed reading it though it kind of got boring in the middle!!!! It was a great story and I would recommend it for children 10-14!!! I liked the adventure and story behind the whole book!!
3,Secret Garden,"Come enjoy the secret gardenwhere only you can seecarrying plants and water in catonsis the job for methat's not it, there is only two more things to itDrama and laughterBut the characters always have a fitOn the other side, the main character is the best daughter."
1,Not the original version Does not have pictures,Item is described as Original version__ Shows book cover with pictures.BUT there are no pictures. I want the original version--Original formatting etc as originally illustrated by the author. I can download the text for free from Gutenberg.....
3,Good story. For children.,"""The Secret Garden"" is an entertaining and exciting read, although personally, I think you're better off reading Charlotte Bront's ""Jane Eyre"". It looks like Mrs. Hodgson Burnett did. Very attentively."
3,Far too advanced for small child,I thought I was ordering a beautifully illustrated book for my 5 year old granddaughter. I would not have ordered this edition if I had known it was so advanced. It is a pretty book but more on adult level than for a child.
1,Do NOT buy the audio cassette,Fine story. Great reader (Claire Bloom). However the quality of the audio is INEXCUSABLY bad! Was the audio engineer asleep?This was my fist venture to buy a non BBC tape. I regret it!I highly recommend always buying BBC books on tape -- it is guaranteed QUALITY.
4,fun with cousins,"I found this book to be a bit overly long and detailed; I was impatient to get to the end. But that is a minor fault. I really liked the beginning, that tells so much about India and British culture; the developing relationships among the three children in the story, especially that between the two cousins; and the idea that fresh air and fun can turn a spoiled child into a happy one. Everything was intriguing and well illustrated--I felt like I was THERE. (Maybe those details were a good thing after all.)"
4,The secret garden,"The secret garden is a wonderfully mysterious book. With Mary's ever changing tempers and an ill boy, plus the almost magical garden that Mary falls upon, there is always adventure and surprise lurking around the corner. I was generally very happy with the quality of the writing, but it was a little slow at some points. I think that plenty of children and adults would enjoy listening to the audio book much more, because it is less slow when you can hear and identify the personality and voice changes, that is, if done by a good reader. I recommend this book for the age group of 3rd through 6th grade. I think that any younger, you'd be very lost, and any older you might be less interested. All in all this was a great book and I give it 4 stars."
4,When i s a w the title i knew i would love the,I chose this rating because i really liked the book.I liked the book because it really told me what was happening.
2,a classic,"It started off so well that I went and bought a copy for a young friend.However, the book deteriorated into crazy philosophy of 'magic' being the reason for everything.Would not recommend it. Started well, but finished badly."
5,Just as I remember,"I read this book years ago and thought it would be a great addition to the classics I have. I missed Mary, the sour girl who lost her parents in India and was forced to move to England. Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down and everything I remember was there again.This is an excellent book to read and really gives you a sense of life and living. If you think you can't, then you probably won't be able to. But if you believe in the magic of life, the happiness to life around you is just behind the door to The Secret Garden."
4,from someone,"I just wanted to say this book is a good book. it is really interesting and it kept me very interested during the whole time i was reading it. this book is very fun to read. i would also like to say that the person that also wrote a review saying this book is boring and said that they looked at the cover and thought it would be interesting well i would just like to ask have you ever heard of the saying ""dont judge a book by its cover""? ^_^"
1,Font too small,"I purchased this book to read to my kids at night; the font is very small, like a 5 or 7 and the lines are very close together. My tired eyes will not be up to the task."
5,Boys LOVE this,"I read this when I was a little girl, many times.I just read it to my little boys, and they LOVE it. It is a story that at the beginning, shows us poor, cross, orphaned Mary as a main character. As the book goes on, Colin becomes the main character -- poor, spoiled, crippled Colin. And Dickon and Martha add a sense of spirit and courage and good nature.This is a wonderful book for reading out loud. The accents are fun.Note #1 -- Frances Hodgson Burnett seems to practice her own private label of spirituality, very magical, not necessarily Christian. This is condensed within the book to a few sections (Colin in the garden) and skippable.Note #2 -- for some reason, this edition of the book offers a study guide at the end. Somewhat lame, but it does not take away from the story line."
4,A wonderful story to read to your daughter...,"My daughter and I have read this wonderful book on several different occasions now, and we have enjoyed it tremendously. My friend tells me that there is a DVD that was made of this story, and I have yet to see it. I would really recommend this book to anyone who'd daughter loves magical and enchanted places."
4,Good Book,I really liked this book and I had never even heard of it until my mother in law told me about it. It was a fun book to read and I'm glad I finally stumbled onto it.
4,Good read,"A little too wordy in parts, or it seemed that way however, a good read. The characters are very believable."
5,All Seasons...,"This lovely book is perfect for any and all seasons. What a beautiful journey! Children find out what it means to be children in a true child's fashion: passionately, stubbornly, freely, joyfully. The children come alive as you read.NOTE: I read this book as a young adult. This is a 're-read' for me. AND it is my very first reading experience on my Kindle Fire HD 7!!! Exciting stuff!!! I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you, Amazon!"
5,Great,"An old classic about a crippled boy hidden away in a mansion after his mother's death. Mary, sent to the mansion after her parents deaths, discovers Colin in the middle of the night as she is wandering the hallways."
5,Something I'll Always Love,"I first picked up this book when my school had auditions for the musical, ""The Secret Garden"", and I couldn't put it down. I even came to be cast as Mary Lennox in the play, and from that experiance I know exactly how she felt about her garden. The book truly came alive. This book is for anyone and everyone. I'm 12 years old and I loved it! The characters are very inspiring. Don't let the movies fool you, this book is a classic. :o) Enjoy it!"
4,Quick read,The book was good and had a good story line. The characters were easy to imagine.The ending was a little abrupt and could have had a little more to it. all in all it was a fast read and very good. i enjoyed it.
5,Awesome book!,"Even though Mary is a little spoiled girl, little did I know she was going to change. I feel really happy for Colin and I agree that it was magic. I recommend this book to others! ^_^"
4,8's book review,Have you ever wondered about having a secret of your own or have you believed in animal charmers? The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett is about a girl named Mary who lived in India untill she had to go to England to Mr. Archiebald Craven's house at Misselthwaite manor. Mary was a sour child at first untill she finds a garden that's been locked up for 10 years. Mary also finds new people and is wondering if she should tell them. Can she keep a secret? You will have to find out in this book.This is for girls 9 and up.
4,A person named Mary who finds the key to the secret garden.,"This book is about a little girl named Mary. Her parents died so the servants sent her to her uncle. However, her uncle did not want her. But she went anyway.While she was there, she found a boy named Collin. He was sick and couldn't walk. They became friends and started taking walks outside. Her and another boy started to teach Collin how to walk. In the end,Mary finds the key for the secret garden, opens the door, and starts fixing up the plants. The uncle finally came out becuase he thought he heard someone calling him. He went to the garden and found his son walking. They had a joyful reunion."
2,Feel good story,Reading the book with the Yorkshire language got annoying after a while. It just didn't keep my interest until I was almost to the end.
5,Still a favourite,"I re-read this book after many years and it's still a favourite, no matter how old I am. It's an uplifting story with a happy ending and, despite being a 'childrens' book', provides some interesting insight into human nature. If you love nature, gardens and British stories, you'll very much enjoy this story.For those of you in America, if the only version you know of this story is the Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie from the 1980s, do yourself a favour and read the book! That film is absolute rubbish and not true to the book. Don't let it put you off.This edition is particularly good if you are buying it for your child or use in the classroom, as there is a discussion guide at the end to stimulate conversation, as well as a brief biography of the author and a mini guide to the Yorkshire dialect used in the book.It's a great story read if the reality of life in the 21st century is getting you down."
5,Incredible Reading/Magical,This book was totally amazing. I loved the writer's style and the way you took a trip back to your childhood.
5,The secret garden,Great book a secret garden indeed 5 star ratingKept you wanting to get to the end to see what was going to happened. The secret garden
5,Great,It is an AMAZING STORY and just showing secrets and the best best best bestFriendship ever.it deserves 5 stars
5,One of my favorite book,This was a pretty awesome book because I enjoy reading about it. I love it very much so thank you.
4,Love of books,"I just love these older books. If our young children today knew these kids of values, the world would be much better."
5,Great book for all ages!,"Even though this book was supposedly written ""for children"", I ENJOYED reading it VERY much! I love happy endings, and the book provided that."
4,Nice Book,"Classic, lovely story. Review pertains more to the actual product as I would give the story 5 stars. The outside of the books is very attractive and well made. The inside flaps are vibrant colors-nicely done. The paper weight is okay-not real flimsy but you can see the text from one side of the page through to the other. Nice texture, though. Words are a nice size font-something I could actually read to my kids without a magnifying glass . Great value."
5,Great story,"This is one of those stories that should be read together by families over the holidays. It is an engaging story with enjoyable characters that grow and mature through the course of the story. Not just for kids, I'm 53 and still love it!"
4,"A lovely and ""otherworld"" read","The Secret Garden was the second book I read as a young girl. I remember not wanting it to end. It hooked me on reading. Now, I not only read but am a writer. Great prose. I recommend it highly."
5,"Gorgeous illustrations, a must have book","This book far exceeded my expectations. The illustrations are absolutely stunning and the story of course is a timeless classic. I would recommend getting it in hardcover if you have the choice as it is a largeish book and I think the soft cover will wear over time. Excellent value, my daughter loves it!"
4,Another Great One,You can never have too many classic books in your e-library and you certainly can't beat the price. Free is nice.
2,The Secret Garden Minh's Review,"The Secret Garden written by Frances Hodgson Burnnet is a traditional literature that's great for reading at night. Mary is moving to a new place full of mystery and wonder, where she finds a secret garden and new friends. Collin a paralyzed boy was forbidden for anyone to see him. Mary on the other hand meets Collin and they become best friends. But will any other of Mary's friends tell anyone about the garden?I don't like this book because most of it is written in Yorkshire and it's very hard to read.If you like to read books that are difficult to understand then this book is perfect for you."
3,ok but boring most of the book,"I had to read it in class and EVREYBODY hated it. I think this book is good for you if you like all those old classic books. I liked Colin though, he was funny. The descriptions were too drawn out and all they ever talk about is the ""magic"" at the end. Most people who like modern books won't like this."
3,The Secret Garden,A well written book very easy to read. Initially I could not put it down but unfortunately it was not as interesting towards the end.
1,Ugh... can someone pass me the barfbag?,"This is without a doubt the worst book that has ever been written. I cannot even begin to describe the sappy, stupid, pointless characters and plot. Please do not ever read this book, it is absolutely awful."
2,A Secretly Stupid Garden,"This is the worst book I have ever read, and I have read a lot of books. The characters have the intelligence of worms and are about as interesting as one to.The story, unfortunatly, starts, at this huge old house. This bratty and selfish girl goes to life, after her parents died (probably couldn't stand her,...).There she meets this other annoying and bratty kid, who, if possible, may be more selfish than her. They eventually become friends, and discover this garden, that would have been better off stayed hidden, for the sake of the readers.And thats basically it. Beginning. Middle. End. Not even an interesting end. I could barely tell the difference between the beginning and the end. That may be a good thing."
1,Horrible for the New Generation,"My 11 year old son was assigned this book this year, and he absolutely hated it. The plot is not nearly fast enough for this generation of children, and there is almost no action. He fell asleep about five times reading this book. No matter what version, The Secret Garden is much too slow."
4,Good book it seems to me. My grand-daughter was indifferent.,"I didn't read the book, and my grand-daughter didn't seem interested. What else can I say?"
2,Queer Goings On In The Shrubbery,"I remembered this book from my childhood as magical. Rereading it as an adult I simply found it dull.Perhaps only a gay man would notice how frequently the words ""queer"" or ""queerest"" appear throughout the text. If you are straight and you didn't notice - believe me it is used ad nauseum. Didn't they have proof readers back then?!"
1,Lousy book,"Boring, absolutely boring.I dropped the book after several efforts to read it. It is a fairy tale on a subject tthat could be absolutely fcinating."
2,Not to be read to young children,"I bought this book thinking it would be a good classic to read to my bright five-year-old daughter. I had never read it myself and I am surprised how boring this book is. Much of the language is way beyond my daughter's comprehension. The word ""queer"" appears hundreds of times, and I only hope I've convinced my daughter that it is no longer an appropriate word to call people. The book is endlessly repetitive, endlessly. I find it to be poorly written and can't believe we wasted our time & money on it. The movie version is quite a bit better. Older children might like this book, but there are some many better choices for even them to read."
1,The Secret Garden,"I had thought that this book was going to be exciting with suprises and an interesting plot. I was wrong! this book not only was boring, it was so boring that i almost fell asleep! there wasnt one exciting part in this novel and i think i wasted my time reading it in the first place! i cannot imagine anyone liking this book. it was about a couple of kids who liked to smell dirt! who wants to read that?! all they did was talk about the flowers and ""the magic"". it was really wierd and is not worth your time! reading a dictionary is more exciting than this book! i wasted my time with this book and i suggest that you dont waste yours!"
1,Secret Garden,"This is an extremely boring book! Judging from the cover, i thought this story was going to be very exciting and myserious! After the first hundred pages, absolutely nothing had happened! Hoping something would happen i continued reading on, sadly nothing did happen! I am disappointed to announce this book is a waste of time... do NOT waste your time reading it! It is just some stupid book about kids that sniff dirt! I would rather sit and stare at a wall then read this boring book again!from,a disappointed reader"
4,perfect for kids and adults,"great book. i took me back to a more peaceful time unlike twilight, which i dont think kids should read. i do think, though, that it could be longer and less practical. i pretty much figured out the end of the book before i got there, cuz it's all happily ever after. frances hodgson burnett could also have made this book shorter and added a sequel. i do love that it is free so im at a neutral position. but still four stars and a half."
5,Oldie but a goody,"It was a good book when it was read to me, and it's still a good book that I enjoyed reading myself 55 years later. Yes, it's a children's book, but not like Dick and Jane, this is a great sturdy story that has lasted the test of time."
4,The Secret Garden,"This is the 38th of the Top 100 books as chosen by librarians I have read. All of them have been good, some of them have been great. This one is very good. Alot of the classics can be a bit dark or depressing. This one like David Copperfield by Dickens, brightens your day. I find myself smiling while I am reading it. It is a good reminder, that the earth can bring joy, anticipation, and a sense of accomplishment."
2,It's great,I loved this! In first grade I saw the movie for the first time but this is a thousand times better!
4,THE SECRET GARDEN,"A MAGNIFICENT BOOK BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN. IT IS A BOOK THAT BOTH ADULTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN WILL ENJOY.THE STORY TELLS US HOW A GARDEN, THE FLOWERS AND THE SETTINGCHANGED THE LIVES OF SO MANY. EVERY DETAIL HAS BEEN DESCRIBEDESPECIALLY THE YOUNG PEOPLE FROM SO DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE.HOW ALL THEIR LIVES CHANGED SO DRASTICALLYI MOST CERTAINLY READ THIS BOOK AGAIN"
2,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,As soon as I stared to read I had to stop because it was so boring. It was a slow starter but I read some of the other Angel books and they are great!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,A good group read,"I am a member of a group of women that reads books slowly and discusses what we read on a weekly basis. We have a leader who assigns additional things for us to look up and do. We have taken this book and have picked people mentioned in the book to read and write about, either in the first person, as journal entries or in the third person. It has been very enjoyable and has brought the book and our history more alive that way. I had reservations about the book because of not very good reviews on the first publication. The author has a new foreword and has adjusted the book answering all the problems that were in the first publication. I am enjoying this newer edition."
2,"Repetitive, cutesy, weak plot","This is the second Bevarly I've read, and it will be the last. ""Just Like A Man"" was repetitive, cutesy rather than funny, the plotting was weak, and the characters were elaborately described but not 3-dimensional. I thought Bevarly had potential to do better. After reading ""You've Got Male"", I give up. The two books were nearly identical - formulaic as well as repetitive."
3,You've Got Male,"To stop in internet terrorist's scheme, Dixon masquerades as a grocery delivery man to get inside Avery Nesbitt's home. With her history of virus creation and her tie to said terrorist, she is dangerous. The look Dixon gets of her computer scares him to death. Once she unleashed a virus that shut down the world, and the one he sees being designed is far worse. He has to reel her in, but hadn't counted on the fact that she is agoraphobic. She agrees to help him stop the man who was planning on using her, so she can go home and find peace. What Avery never anticiapated was how much Dixon would disturb her peace and how safe that disturbance would feel.*** The light that is shone on Avery's affliction makes this a worthwhile read without the compelling plot. However, with the timely plot, it makes it more than worth your time, it makes this book a winner. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,If you MUST read it - borrow it!,"Not really a badly written book but the secret government agency aspects are just dumb, right down to the silly nicknames. I won't avoid Elizabeth Bevarly just because of this book but I will look further than a catchy title before laying out full price for one"
4,Not usual romance cheese,"I liked the sarcasm in this book because, let's face it, these days everyone is sarcastic. I liked that the romance in this book wasn't super cheese like the romance of my mother's day. You know what I am talking about. The ones that leave women looking like dumb, weak victims that need the big strong man to survive.If you look past the gov. agency (which was a bit cheesy) and don't get too technical on computer stuff (because it isn't always accurate and is stretched a little to work for the author for the sake of story line, which the average person wouldn't even notice) it was a good, contemporary book. Written in this era, this society, not some throbbing manhood, please help me; I'm just a girl, world."
3,Clip fell off,"Within the week that I got it, the clip got pretty loose but it stayed on for another few weeks. Less than a month later, the clip fell off and a screw got lost. Other than that, it's a good knife."
1,Maxam knife,"Matrix and Maxim products are chinese junk,low in price, but not worth one cent.The sliding button lock is a rip off of Benchmade's Axis Lock.do yourself a favour and buy the real thing.A good quality knife costs more than a few dollars."
5,What can I say,Oil is oil ... and this does not need my endorsement ... it has been around longer than i have ... just what i needed for keeping my fans running quiet and smooth.
5,Helped fix noisy computer fan!,This combined with dry powder graphite helped fix noisy computer fan! Now its completely silent! Product is very easy to use.
4,Forbidden Romance - sizzling hot!,"It's a king-size opportunity to get everything she wants - A three day bed-in is the perfect way for aspiring DJ Erica Gibson to get on air. This promotional stunt could even lead to her having her own show on the radio. Too bad she's cohosting with the station Lothario rather than hottie Adam ""the Hawk"" Hawkins.Her wish is granted when Adam shows up on location. Dream job and dream guy.....does life get any better? After everyone leaves and the lights go out, Erica seduces him.While their steamy after-dark activities go against the station's rules, they agree that what happens in the bed stays in the bed. Back at work those forbidden adventures still tempt them. Then again, there's nothing like the thrill of the forbidden....."
1,"Great cast, but, great movie?","One would think that with a cast like this it couldn't miss. But, what a turkey. ""Plan 9 from Outerspace,"" may be the only movie that I've seen that is worse. Actually, ""Plan 9,"" may be a better movie.What a waste of the talents of Yul Brenner, Robert Mitchem, Charles Bronson, and Herbert Lom.Pretty sad..."
4,Rousing action adventure film,"Some terrific battle sequences, a great cast: Mitchum, Brenner and Bronson. Some epic battles, train ambushes, columns of Federales, and some great flying scenes with Mitchum as the mercenary pilot. Fun movie for a Saturday afternoon and nice soundtrack. Don't make 'em like this anymore. Even some truth to some of the plotline."
1,Disappointment in the Colorforms product,"I purchased this product based on the reputation of Colorforms in the past (even from my childhood), and based on the fact that it was being to two little girls who love to dress up their dolls, etc. Most of the individual dressing pieces did not ""peel off"" very well on the initial trial, and as such, would not stick to the cardboard dolls very well-if they initially came off that way, they were basically ruined for the game. It was so bad that after playing the game three times, the girls threw the game out because their were so few playing pieces left to dress up the dolls with. And yes, an adult DID help them initially peel off the pieces, so that was not the issue. This is certainly not a product I would recommend to anyone, and I was very disappointed in the Colorforms line that they would put out something of such poor quality."
1,"Smash it with a hammer, you'll enjoy it more.","Bought because of past positive experience with Philips. Apx. 10 hours later, including 1/2 hour with live tech assistance & I have 1, single song loaded. Now player shows ""0 bytes/0 bytes (0 bytes available)"" & I can't load another song. More live tech assistance couldn't figure it out. Supposed to have ""escalated"" to supervisor, no call yet.Asked for a refund. Nope. Can have a replacement. It will be more satisfying to smash it into pieces and send it to Philips than spend another hour trying to get it or a replacement to work."
4,Great for running!,"From the MP3 players I've used for running, this is definetly my favorite. Arm band works great, & head phones are very comfortable & stay in place while running. Only negative to this MP3 is 128 MB of memory is not enough, beside that I love it!"
2,It was ok in the beginning then broke down,I was in the gym and it went on and then off. I then proceeded to try to turn it on and it did not work. I didnt not even try to fix the product b/c I read all of these awful reviews on amazon. I personally just went out and bought and iRiver iFP-890. I read the reviews on amazon and it was quite helpful. Again did not buy anything that is made by Nike Phillips b/c it seems to me it just doesnt work and it is a waste of money.
2,"Half good, half bad.","I like the size and general design of the 128 max, but the headphones are terrible. The main problem is that it doesn't play most encrypted songs that you buy off the internet, like from BuyMusic.com. That's a huge bummer. So you're limited to songs ripped of your CDs or non-encrypted songs from Napster of Kazaa. I returned mine."
2,Looks Are Deceiving,"While pleasing to the eye this unit is a piece of junk. It worked for about a month. I spent entirely too much time trying to get the thing to work and I'm definitely technologically inclined. The device was tempermental each time I tried to send music to the portable via MusicMatch. Sometimes all my files on the device would sporadically disappear and I would have to download all over again. Finally, the Philips tech support (located in God know which developing country) were useless. I called them at least once a week and they were useless. I'm sending my device back."
2,Nike 128max MP3 player,If you are into cute looking products then definetly get this. But if you want something that is not a headache everytime you want to download songs then don't get this player. Everytime that you want to download songs it is an absolute headache with a capital H. I have had to call the 1-800 number at least 5 times to download songs. It is not worth the price that it costs.
1,stay away,Do not make the mistake I did. The nike-phillips psa does not support any music wma files that you purchase and download from any legitimate site (musicmatch etc.) If you buy this player - all you will be able to do is copy your CD's that you own onto it. I called nike-phillips 3 times and they admit the problem but refuse to offer any help. They also do not offer any refund.
4,fairly good product,"The things I liked: lots of music storage, REALLY easy transferring music files, rechargeable battery is nice, multiple Velcro attachment places on the arm band for smaller arms, different musical settings (eg ""rock"", ""hip-hop"")Things I didn't like: the buttons are WAY too small which makes them hard to find and to press, headphones don't fit well (not the ear pieces- the band that goes around your head).Overall I like the device but the small buttons are a real problem and in that regard, I preferred the old Nike PS3. Different headphones can be purchased to go with the player so the headphones aren't such an issue. A few cool but mostly useless features it had were that the name of the current song would scroll across the ""face"" of the device and the face lights up when buttons are pressed. This last feature would be nice for running in the dark except that you're not really in a position to see the outside of your arm when wearing the player."
3,Simply not designed by active people...,"Decent sound quality.However, the software that comes with the player (Musicmatch) is not very user friendly. The device isn't compatible with most of the music download sites, even two listed on it's own website!!And here is the worst thing about it.. THE HEADPHONES ARE HORRIBLE!! There is simply no way that these things were designed by anyone that's ever tried to listen to music while working out... simply no way. If you're lifting they simply pop off every set and if your running you are continually adjusting them.Kudos to Nike on the wire management. That does work. If you are buying these for walking or sedentary listening they are at best a mediocre product. If you are buying them because the concept of a small device with quality sound for working out appeals to you... Save your cash!"
1,DONT BUY IT,understood its cheap.... but not worth the hassle. you never know when the bloody thing will not switch on - i hate those file error messages... especially when you are all set to pump some iron. half the time the POS with hang - and now it wont format. i am just going to buy an ipod... pricey but atleast i will have my music in the gym.
2,Not made to last.,"It busted after about a year's worth of average use, both the unit and the headphones shortly thereafter. But when it did work, had decent sound."
1,"junk, junk, junk","Got it a year and a half ago and threw it in the garbage yesterday.Over the year and a half it froze often and required reformatting and re-downloading of songs - a real pain when you're at the gym and realize the thing ain't going to work, and will also require time at home messing with it to get it operating again. Then last week the thing just froze up and wouldn't even re-format and take new songs. Instead of calling customer support, I went a bought an I-Pod - then went running."
1,Waste of MONEY - Get the SonicBlue Rio Sport 128 instead,"I bought this because the SonicBlue Rio Sport 128 was out of stock. No big deal. The Nike 128 is the same price so it should be similar, right?Wrong!The SonicBlue Rio Sport has FM tuner, Clock, Stopwatch and can be upgraded to 256mb, FOR THE SAME PRICE AS THE NIKE! It also has a belt clip.The Nike 128 is tiny (good) but the buttons are too small to be useful. The head phones are too flimsy which makes it uncomfortable to wear.Over all this player is a waste of money.. Get the SonicBlue Rio Sport 128 instead.The"
1,Horrible Product,"One trip in light rain - DeadSoftware doesn't work and locks up computer constantly.You can't purchase tracks from Napster and download onto device.I have owned 2 of these units (shame on me for the 2nd time), and really wanted to love it. However, it is complete junk.Do not waste your money on it."
2,Quit working after a month,"I bought this thing while i was TDY in the desert and after using it only a month every day the thing stopped working and i had already had problems with it freezing up on me. oh well, it was good while it lasted"
1,Unable to get downloaded songs to play,"I received this as a Mother's Day gift and was excited to get going and use it on my morning run. I downloaded the software, hooked up the unit and appeared to have downloaded about 30 songs onto it. After I finished, I saw the names of the songs scrolling across the unit so all appeared right with the world. Until I plugged the headphones in and tried to listen to the songs. I pressed the play button and got nothing. I also tried another pair of headphones just in case they were the problem, but it didn't help. ... Regardless, the unit didn't work with either version of Musicmatch.Perhaps a working version of this unit would be a wonderful thing, ... There appear far too many problem units out there since many seem to be many others having the same or similar problems with it."
3,Pretty-- wish it worked with OSX,"I'd thought it would work with OSX at least as a mini-hard-drive you could just drag files to, but no luck.Love the appearance. Looks really well done. I ended up going with the Rio Sport S30S, which is about the same size, costs a little less, and although it has less memory, does have an upgrade slot that for about the cost of the nike one will put you at 192MB instead of the 128 from the Nike...Tossup really."
2,Not for high-level workouts,"The main point of this review is to warn users to protect the player from sweat. Perhaps put it over clothing rather than under ... or strap it to the stairmaster. I used this for about a year. ... and, yes, I agree with the other reviewers that it is a temperamental unit. It took a while, but I eventually got it running. Philips support line is rather weak. I felt as though I knew more about the system when calling. I used a different pair of headphones (the ones supplied are weird!). At first I noticed that the battery was getting corroded. So I tried to dry it off after all uses (I used it on 5-7 mile runs). It didn't seem to work too well. Now, one year later, the only button that works is the on-off switch. I can add music ... but no volume control, fast-forward or rewind. I am looking into the Rio Cali unit"
2,A great idea put together by some dumb people,"I read the reviews to this product before I purchased mine and I thought those people complaining about the software problems and everything were just not good with technology. However, I've found that downloading the songs to the player is near impossible if you have a problem with installing the drivers. I've spent nearly an hour so far and the only real directions it gives to how to use this device are online. The product comes with a couple [weak] pictures that make the process look rather easy. If you have no problems with the installation or downloading the songs this product would be a good investment. If not you are in for a world of headaches like myself."
2,Does not recognize DRM for downloading music,"Positive: Nice, clean design, splashproof.Negative: Does not support digital rights management for windows media player files. Therefore you cannot download music tracks from Napster, MusicNow and other services. I checked with Phillips directly and they confirmed that this is a peculiarity of this PDA.Another negative, often mentioned, is the software. The supplied software has been deliberately hobbled to force you to pay an extra $20, in a kind of reverse rebate plan. The sample software nags you before, during and after every use that you must pay this extra fee to get the most out of your player. But even with the upgrade, you still cannot download .wma music files from the net."
1,Great product - when it works,"If you buy this be sure to buy an extended warranty. That is the best move I made. The product is great while working - it holds about 2 hours of music, is lightweight, the sound is good. It is a distance runner's dream - designing your own commercial free 2 hours of your music for those long runs. Unfortunately the life expectancy is around 4 months. I bought one with an extended Circuit City warranty and returned it in 3 months. I figured I just had a bad unit and purchased another with the refund and it was better - it lasted 5 months. I am still looking for a replacement but I will never purchase one of these again."
3,style but no substance,"The battery life was terrible, the buttons impossible to deal with, functionality [bad], and sound mediocre. I was really disappointed. It's great for working out because of the armband and the remote and the magnets are cool but overall I was really disappointed. I'm currently shopping for a new mp3 player."
1,What the F@#$,"I recently purchased this item 3 days ago. I spent 2 hours trying to download songs into it, but the thing kept turning off. Come to find out the battery that came with it was dead. A new battery later and I was able to download songs but they wouldn't play. I couln't get anything to show up on the player. All I got was a blank screen. After spending $200.00 bills on this piece of crap I excepted it to work. Luckly I purchased it at Sears and directly took it back. What a piece of junk. I'll save up for the Ipod."
1,Trouble with a capital T,"Coolest MP3 player available. I wanted to like this player so much, it's beautiful, light and easy to carry. First, the manual did not tell me how to properly install the software on my Mac. But I found instructions on a private site on the net. The headphones: NOT SPORT HEADPHONES. They work fine sitting in a chair but with any head movement, they fall off. I fixed this by buying Koss headphones, they worked great riding my bike or jogging. I used the player for almost a year, it was difficult to get mp3's on and off, but it worked. Now it has quit working all-together and I have been unable to find service or repair for it. Philips has a phone number for support but for the past week I get a message saying it is unavailable."
1,2 words - STAY AWAY!,"Horrible software support! Horrible physical connectivity! I've had this product working off and on for about one year. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Uses MusicMatch spy/bloatware - NO OTHER ALTERNATIVES to upload music to the player (I looked and tried third-party software, nothing worked reliably).Horrible design for the USB connection - the back of the case is cheap and flimsy, not user friendly, feels like it will break when you open it up to attach the USB cable, which is at a wierd angle and feels wrong. Shoddy workmanship for this price! I had to exchange the headphones 4 days after purchase because they broke. The magnets have also chipped out of their retaining rings. This thing is junk.If the unit worked as cool as it looks, it MIGHT be worth the high price tag. Horrible software, horrible design, almost no tech support - a real loser! Don't waste your money. Swoosh indeed - right out of your wallet and into the trash. Go get something better."
1,Junk,"What a piece of ... I spent almost an hour on the phone with a very helpful customer service rep trying to get this thing to work... I finally got 10 songs loaded on it and was off to the gym. The head phones are way to small the buttons are to small. The only thing good that I liked about it was the armband. This evening, I got to spend another few hours on the phone with another customer service rep. I came to the conclusion that this is a good-looking piece of garbage. I can't wait to get my money back."
2,dont do it.,"I am not much of a computer person, so the software for this player has been very very frustrating. I have seen better user friendly software out there.. I have used the player ONLY a handful of times and today, as I set out for my run, it has decided just not to work anymore. I am about ready to return this piece of crap..and the headphones suck too. i should have spent my money on an ipod."
1,Horrible,"I spent almost an hour on the phone with a very helpful customer service rep trying to get this thing to work... I finally got 10 songs loaded on it and was off to the gym.

1,"It was great, but then....","I bought the Nike 128 MB MP3 Player about 14 months ago... With a few small glitches here and there, it performed pretty well. Then, out of nowhere, it just died on me... I treat my electronic equipment very well, so it was not due to abuse. It is not a batter issue either. It just will not work.I would recommend staying away from this peice of garbage and getting any other unit... It is just not worth the trouble..."
2,"Good Player, horrible quality","I used this player and enjoyed it while using it for running. I was a huge fan of the product until I took it out running in a pretty heavy rain storm, and it shorted out on me. It hasn't worked since. I think it's ridiculous that this sport mp3 player couldn't handle the rain. I would not buy this product again. If you do, do not take it out into the rain, it can't handle water."
4,I found out how the get unit to work under OS 10.2.6 and up,"I hated the unit until now! I have OS 10.2.6 and could not use it!...until now.I surfed the internet and found a philips resource site that had the answer.It now works with iTunes!You have to install the firmware update...Download install at:http://www.p4c.philips.com/files/p/psa128max/the file is called:psa128max_fum_eng.sitAnother file is called:psa128max_fur_eng.txtDownload both and follow Mac OS instructions in the text documentIt is confusing because it involved installing the program,Opening the program with the unit connected WITH THE BATTERY OUT and hold down the play button while you put the battery back in.This process, strange as it is, queries a website and installs the Firmare upgrade. Then the unit turns into a hard drive and iTunes sees it!Have fun,Stryker"
2,too temperamental,"I recently bought this player to use as a running companion for short 2-3 mile runs. I figured the 128 mb would hold plenty of music for that distance. I was innitially ecstatic at the quality and volume of sound (even if the software is a little tricky at first). after 3 weeks it has started to switch itself off every couple of minutes. I have formatted it several times with no success. Luckilly I had bought the replacement warranty and will be returning it first chance I get and trading in for the RIO Cali, which has gotten better reviews.After reading the bad reviews here I thought ""no, this can't happen to me, the other people must be doing something wrong"". However I have used this gadget by the book and the same thing is happening to this player as has happened to all the other reviewers. Be warned, get the replacement warranty or better yet get the Cali first time around"
1,Caveat emptor,"I have owned the Nike sport 128 MP 3 player for 15 months and have had nothing but trouble with it. I only use it 3-4 times a week during my 6-mile runs. When it is working it sounds great. However it crashes frequently and the memory becomes corrupted easily. I have had it replaced 3 times by Philips. I received my last one 6 weeks ago and it is already corrupted (it took 3 months to get the replacement) After working for an hour with the technician (located in Jamaica) they gave up. They will not replace this one because the warranty from the first one is now up. I have spent days over the past year (I was on hold for 4 hours once trying to get help) reformatting and installing firmware upgrades on this unit. I am computer savvy, but this is too much to me. This unit breaks so frequently that they have a division just for replacing them."
1,Garbage,"I bought two in the last 6 months, including one 4 days ago and they both died while I was out running. This thing has many glitches and clearly is not water-resistant. If Nike/Phillips can work out the problems, it is a good design and really helps your workouts, but I won't be buying again until they spend some more time on product development. Wait for sony to come out with a sports model mp3."
1,An Expensive Mistake,"I never even got a chance to exercise with it. First of all the product manual is on the CD (provided). Normally this wouldn't be a problem only it wouldn't open off the CD, and I had to go to the website to get the information. Secondly, I got to listen to a total of an hour of music before the player started to register ""NO FILE"". After many attempts to format, reinstall software, and replace batteries WINDOWS proclaimed ""The disc could not be formatted."""
2,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT RAIN RESISTANT,"I got caught in some rain while on a long run and this product died, never to work again. You can't run in the rain with this device. It was actually a nice product up untill then (except for the headphones)."
3,"good, but overambitious and strained","I get to be the snob and say that this album is good, but it pales in comparison to his out-of-print debut album, ""All Balls don't Bounce."" I actually like the music better on this album, but the concept is a bit hard to take and the songs sound a bit forced. His songs on All Balls have the same rhythmic flow and crazy word-play, but they feel more focused, maybe because they aren't leashed into some hokey concept. I also find the spoken introductions (i.e. table of contents) unnecessary and annoying on repeated listenings.That said, there's plenty of great moments. Guidelines, Faces, and Thief in the Night in particular.Still, there's nothing funnier than Annalilhia, nothing more tongue-numbingly dextrous than Greatest Show on Earth, and no better comment on ghetto life than Mr. Outsider. ""All Balls Don't Bounce"" is definitely the album to get, if you can find it."
3,Overrated,"I saw Aceyalone in concert a little while back, with Prince Paul and Eyedea. It was a really dope show - Aceyalone in particular put on a great performance. But his albums are just not that good. His rhymes are often purportedly high-falooting, but in actuality are rather simplistic in comparison to many, many superior emcees. Aceyalone also shares KRS-One's unfortunate propensity to pump himself up as the ""best ever,"" which is rather annoying but forgivable. And certainly, there are good songs, and the concept is original, but ultimately it fails the test of being something that I would be interested in listening to on a regular basis."
5,FINALLY,"Hip-Hop has finally entered a new dimension. With Human Language, Acey has created a new realm for Hip-Hop music. This album isn't just ""conscious"" rap, but also a bible of musical near-perfection. Aceyalone and Mumbles communicate with each other so well that the two artists become one. I would normally list specific tracks to peep, but to listen to only a couple of songs on this album would be a felony. Aceyalone is my favorite rapper. Ever."
5,Great songwriting,"If every human being who thought hiphop was all nonsense heard this album they would have to admit it takes talent to be this good, cause Aceyalone makes an album that in my opinion surpasses many other great albums, the beats perfectly fit the mood while Aceylone presents us with many subjects and topics to listen to, he is easily one of hiphop's top 5 songwriters, those who have listened to this album would not argue, but its honestly a shame that most people who are even into hiphop music and fans of music in general will probably never hear this album, peace."
4,Get This Before It Disappears!,"Aceyalone proves once again why he is one of the most dangerous MCs to stomp the Terra Firma. The follow up to his ill fated Capitol release All Balls Don't Bounce, this release is a return to his underground roots, with his Lyrical Maturity, Universal Vision, Unbeatable Ryhm Skills, and Smooth As Wet Glass Backing Tracks in full effect. This Guy has done nothing but grow and expand on the visions he has laid down since his days with the Freestyle Fellowship, with little critical acclaim, and almost zero Hip-Hop Fan awareness east of the Mississippi. The first half of this albumn is a little slow, and conceptual (including his weird take on Lewis Carroll's Jaberwocky), but by the second half, he demonstrates the exceptional, exponential, and evolutionary artistic growth that has always made him one of a kind. Most refreshing in this age of stale ghetto fabulousness and/or humorless 5 percent flavored posturing. A bold and refreshing approach!"
2,= * *,"My expectations might have been set better if the title was something like ""Special Edition Teach Yourself Relational Databases Using PostgreSQL in 24 Hours For Dummies"".I think this book is extremely thin on useful relevant content, although not completely without value; nevertheless, the books ""PostgreSQL Essential Reference"" and ""Begininning Databases with PostgreSQL"" are available now, and in my opinion they are vastly more useful than this book.NB: ""Practical PostgreSQL"" is not out yet as I write this review."
1,The Worst Book I've ever bought,The author focus on nothing. He even don't have a clue what's the difference between inheritance and template as you can see in chapter 18.
5,Dawkin's Essay is worth the book,"The first essay in this collection of essays is an excellent explanation of the reason for religion: religion is a virus of our minds. It is also well written, entertaining, and provides a model of cultural change that seems sound. A must for anyone who wants to understand why we have the world we have today"
5,Deep but Practical,"Muldoon mixes a perfect blend of grounded theology and practical advice in this easy-to-read guide to Ignatian philosophy, using real world examples from his personal life, academic career and years as a rowing coach."
1,how much will you pay for an hour of filler tracks?,"Start off by napping for tracks 1-5, instrumental and boring tracks. Wake up a little for Robbie Rivera's ""Bang,"" and finally, find a hint of euphoria in the 11 minute cut of Bobby, featuring trancey synths and mellow yet attitude-filled female vocals. Gloria Gaynor is in the mix-supposedly. Question is, where are the vocals? Moby's track is lame, Who Am I is played to death, 5 Below 0, more dulling instrumental. Some vocal returns for Shiftie, a wind down track. And the final track is a mellow-dramatic vocal track. This disc is nearly all filler. Pass on it. Track times:1. one step beyond (1:42)2. Action (4:10)3. Special (4:37)4. all exhale (7:16)5. Give it to me (7:01)6. bang (7:15)7. Bobby (11:08)8. just keep thinking about you (3:46)9. porcelain (7:21)10. who am I (3:24)11. 5 below 0 (7:08)12. shiftie (6:39)13. ready to love again (2:33)"
3,JBL Sub,"I love JBL products. I own a JBL Mpro system, satellites and sub, and I have used it since the early 2000 and never had I had any problems with it, I am just a little disappointed with the JRX118S I expected to have more of a punch than it actually has."
4,Questions and Comment,What i'm hoping for is to find out whether or not there is a book out on the 5th Hart brother Callagan and his wife Dorie. If there is what is the name of it? I also liked Love with A Long Tall Texan.So far I've liked all of Diana Palmer's books.Some are better than others but they are still very good.It all depends on what you are looking for when you read her books.Thanks.Diane
2,three boring couples makes a boring book,I'm not sure why I gave this book 2 stars. The stories were so unbelievable. Each of the men were maddly in love with each of the woman after being with them for all of week or less. The woman really got on my nerves. And the men were the biggest bunch of whiners I have ever read. Diana Palmer please stop with LONG TALL TEXAN'S books. If you feel need to write about Texas men then maybe you should go to Texas and see what real rugged Texas men are all about.
3,More of those cowboys!,"While not quite up to the quality of some of the earlier Long Tall Texans, these guys weren't obnoxiously macho either. I certainly liked them much better then Justin and Calhoun.I thought the story with Luke Craig and the camp for delinquent boys was touching and enjoyed the other two stories also. Not an outstandingly wonderful book--but a pleasant evening's read and I also bought the audio book and enjoyed it too."
3,Her Kind of Hero,"Have read many Diana Palmer novels. Most stories are interesting, but she needs to lose the word ""lean"". Wow, is it ever over-used"
2,"Short stories maybe, definitely not a novel!","I am a great fan and I was sorely disappointed in this book. The other Long, Tall Texan series were books that could stand on their own. These are obviously short stories put together to form a book. They look like storylines that were rejected earlier but when no ideas appeared, the author cobbled them together. I usually keep the books to re-read them later. This one I am definitely trading at the used book store!"
3,Ho hum...,"While I will not be as brutal as many of the reviewers here I, too, was disappointed with this book. All three stories lacked the charismatic heroes of her best works, and the heroines lacked spirit as well. They all fell in love in a matter of days, there was no emotional conflict as has been Palmer's hallmark and none of the steamy dialogue and sexual tension that has made me such a fan of many of her past works. I never thought I would have to force myself through a Diana Palmer book, but I did with this one. The best thing about this collection is that at least the heroes don't smoke like chimneys. It probably deserves fewer stars than I am giving, but as I devoted fan I cannot bring myself to do it. Suffice it to say, this one is going to the used bookstore, pronto."
1,Can I get a refund?????,"Hello, will the real Diana Palmer please come home? Don't buy this book, it was awful. The characters were totally unreal, and the romance was nonexistant....Diana, stop the Texas deal and write about what you know about...."
1,Well I was not happy with this one(not even worth a star),"I like Diana Palmer's books and really enjoy finding the ones that have gone out of print so I was really excited when I went to the bookstore and found the latest intstallment of the Long Tall Texans. I got it home read it in about two minutes and hated it. It was a waste of my money and I hope that her new book Paper Rose brings her back to the great writing that all of her fans know she is capable of. Hoping for something better. P.S. If you are going to write a book don't make it so hurried, and I can buy lots of far fetched Romance stories, but having known a person for five minutes just does not seem long enough to decide to get married"
1,I COULD HARDLY GET THROUGH THIS BOOK. IT WAS SOOO BAD.,"THIS WAS PROBABLY THE WORST DIANA PALMER BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ. ALL THREE STORIES WERE BORING WITH THE WORST WRITING SHE HAS EVER DONE. I HAD TO FINISH THE BOOK JUST TO SEE IF MY ENDURANCE COULD HOLD OUT. HER STORIES HAVE THE MENTALITY OF THE 1950'S; HOWEVER, SHE TRIES TO PASS THEM OFF AS HAPPENING AT THIS TIME. WHAT A PREDICTABLE DISAPPOINTING AUTHOR SHE HAS BECOME!"
2,"Ms. Palmer, Shame on You!","Not one of her best efforts, and I have read all her novels to date. The characters are under-developed, the passion superficial, and the stories are trite after a fashion. This book provides just a glancing taste of future novels as yet to be written by this author. Mediocre read."
4,Very Good read,"Morrell (The Brotherhood of the Rose) prefaces all the stories with personal anecdotes and other autobiographical reflections that place them in a meaningful context. In a foreword and afterword, Morrell talks about his career thus far."
3,Typical Van Vogt: fascinating ideas bordering on fantasy,"This novel concerns a far-future Earth, thousands of years after civilization has been destroyed in a catastrophe of unknown origin. Aspects of advanced science remain (spaceships) simultaneously with primitive features (bows and arrows), and Earth is carrying on longstanding wars of subjugation with human cultures on Mars and Venus. This is the story of a mutant, Lord Clane, of noble birth, but with a body warped by radiation, and his efforts to raise society to a higher plane. The characters are mostly flat, but Van Vogt ladles out the imaginative concepts as skilfully as ever, and never fails to hold the reader."
3,"Good camera, small memory","The camera was ok. It works well, althought the biggest memory you can purchase is 128 MB. The manufacturers discontinued making this kind of memory cards, and the cards are really expensive. If you are looking to buy a camera with smaller memory this camera would be perfect. It also works well as a webcam."
1,Breaks all the time,"Within 3 months this camera stopped working. I never dropped the camera, I've never exposed it to extreme temperatures, the camera looks brand new on the outside. Several functions stopped working 2 monts before the camera stopped working. I sent the camer in to fuji for repair; and got it back 4 weeks later, now the zoom doesn't work. If you don't enjoy unnecessary suffering; DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA! If you want a digital camera, get an olympus."
1,Very disappointed,what can I say -Lousy focus; almost no depth of fieldpoor software; works ok on w2000 but not on xppointless cradle; nice idea but it proves to be useless on xp- wish I had bought another make
1,I did not receive the correct charm.,"The process was fine, I am having trouble returning the incorrect charm I received instead of this Artistic Hearts charm. I have no idea what the item number is of the one I received in error. It appears to be a man with black hair wearing a red (wife beater) t-shirt - maybe holding a trophy?"
4,Great for the holidays.,This packet is perfect for when shipping gifts and a bow would just get crushed. I like to make a good luck crane for those items and the foil makes them beautiful.
3,Origami Foil,"I am currently folding 1000 cranes and thought this would be a fun paper to use. It's not very pliable, and it tears. Maybe if I was using a tool I could get sharper edges? It is pretty though, lots of colors!"
2,large Origami color foil paper,"I was happy with the 2 other origami papers that I ordered but this one was disappointing. It was called LARGE but was no bigger than the 4x4"" papers the others were."
2,Not what I expected....,The color of these foil is great but it says that its thin so I expected just colored foil without paper on the back. So I dont know if there is out there just colored foil or not but this one is not what I needed.
3,"Book is geared towards British pronunciation, not American English","I was surprised when I received this book to find that the pronunciation taught by these games is RP (Received Pronunciation) or British English. Though some of the games deal with intonation, word stress, etc., and can be used for teaching American English, be aware that many of these games will not be useful for teaching American English pronunciation.However, if you are teaching British English pronunciation, this book could be a nice resource."
3,Pronunciation Games,"The book is not bad as an additional resource in the classroom. There tends to be an over use of the phonetic alphabet which can make the games more an academic exercise, rather than a fun way to learn pronunciation. Other than that, there a numerous other activities which help students put the correct stress on a word. The stress activities are very good."
5,great games for pronunciation,"I bought this book based on seeing it used in a Pronunciation class that I took. I bought it for use in my ESL classroom. It's great because it addresses a variety of pronunciation issues via games for a variety of learner levels. It has easy to follow directions, and it's photocopiable. I've already used a few of the games with my class and the students love it. This book helps to add fun to a potentially boring topic!!"
2,"Best of the covers, which isn't saying much","I love the Scorpions and have always looked forward to hearing them covered, but so far I am have always been pretty disappointed. This album however, is the best of the Scorpions tribute albums I have heard. The rendition of The Zoo is horrible, failing to capture any of the mood of the original. There are some interesting takes on a song or two but mostly Klaus Meine set the vocal standard to high on most of these tunes and while I wouldn't expect a singer to sound like him, I expect them to be better than this collection. Still, for diehards, there MIGHT be enough to make this worth your money."
2,Squandered Opportunity,"First off, it's not 162 stories & 162 games. The author skipped one game to take in the Florida Marlins hurricane make-up game at Sox Park and another to take in a college football game! Hence, squandered opportunity. Also, doubleheaders share one story. Lots of nice individual stories, otherwise, although they rarely related to the game ""chapter"" they fell into. The errors got to be annoying, such as the story about a fan who rented an apartment just outside Wrigley Field described as being on the corner of two streets that do not intersect."
4,"If properly titled ""Cub Nation"" would be 5 stars","Incredible book. I am a huge Cub fan and reading this book had me wanting to read more Wojciechowski. I actually read his ""Three Nights in August."" Anyway, this is a fantastic book for all Cub fans."
5,So tired of sour grapes,"Big deal you won a world series on the south side. big deal you went wire-to-wire and tied the Yankees for best postseason record ever. Have you ever seen the mamacitas at Wrigley Field? That stuff makes me mental, real baseball fans know it's all about the atmosphere and the neighborhood. What happnes on the field is secondary, if it even matters at all. Cubs rule. Do you need a list you playa-hating Sox fans? How about Ronnie Woo-Woo, Sluggers, Left Field Bleachers, Sammy Sosa, Murphy's, the hot girls in the luxury boxes, Ernie Banks, Andre The Hawk Dawson, Dave Kingman, Bump Willis, Sammy Sosa, and most of all RYNO! -- Let's play two!"
4,One of Hoffman's most controversial works!,"Born Bad, by Barry Hoffman (Gauntlet Press, ...) Shanicha is probably the most diabolical villain since Cruella De Ville. Her cunning enables her to commit murder from afar--definitely a novel approach. Shanicha will make you believe that someone really could be, ""Born Bad""...."
1,definately not a classic,"Pooh I like, but this video just wasn't fun. The characters seem kind of flat and boring - nothing like Pooh and friends from the ""classics""."
3,Less expensive alternative from same author,"Right now, this book is out of print and selling used for over $300 dollars based on the current prices listed in Amazon. That's bloody outrageous.If you want these recipes, don't bother buying this. Kathleen King lost the rights to the ""Kathleen's Bake Shop"" trademark, but she has a new cookbook available from her new business venture: Tate's Bake Shop. Buy the Tate's Bake Shop Cookbook instead of the older overpriced book listed here.You don't believe me? Use your favorite search engine and search with: Kathleen King bake shop."
5,This has the best of the best!!,"I bought this book because of a rave review which appeared in the St. (MN) Paul Pioneer Press a few years ago. I have never been let-down by any of the recipes which appear in it. Can you imagine two loaves of banana bread which require 4-1/2 cups of mashed bananas to create? Or how about chocolate chip cookies which are so good that we have to buy chips in ten pound bags at Sam's Club? In this book, you will find only one recipe for any one thing, as the author puts only her favorite recipes of each type in it. Buy this book, and get extras for gifts and yourself. People will ask where you got the recipe, and you will find that your copy will wear out and you will need another."
2,This video is worthwhile only for hardcore Leo fans.,"This video is worth the time and money for hardcore Leonardo fans only. It isn't a compilation of two hours of varied interviews with Leonardo, but a total of about twenty or thirty minutes of Leo discussing his films at different points in his career, each time with the same interviewer. This is interspersed with interview clips from other cast members of his films. The third tape is a boring, hour-long recording of Titanic's Hollywood premeire. There are no interviews with Leo's close friends or family members, and nothing about his personal life. But if you're like me, and relish just hearing Leo's voice, go ahead and splurge. There is some in-depth commentary on his work, because the video, thankfully, was not edited MTV-style, but can actually focus on each interview for several minutes."
4,Perfect,"An excellent combination of price and functionality. I've had no problems with using these in my home theater setup, and will definitely buy them again if I ever wire another in-wall theater system."
4,This is NOT salsa,"Haciendo Punto en Otro Son ( or simply, Haciendo Punto) started in Puerto Rico during the mid seveties as part of Latin America's Nueva Trova (+/- New Song)which was already a major movement lead by Cuba, Argentina and Chile. Besides playing native rythms from Puerto Rico (salsa IS of cuban origin), they would also play songs from the rest of South America as to introduce puertorrican audiences with these songs of strong social thematics. Thanks to them, the almost forgotten puertorrican country music (in this case, ""mountain music"")became popularized amongst middle class youths bringing an alternative to those of us who did not, at the moment, like salsa. The band lasted for about 10 year, but not with its original members. This record compiles part of it, but the best are those who have the original members:Silverio Pérez (Cuban exilé)Tony Croatto (argentinian of Italian descent)Nano Cabrera (Puertorrican)Josie LaTorre (Puertorrican)"
4,Great story,"I totally agree with a previous reviewer: this read really brings Euwe to life. I could imagine the different moments of Euwe's life, thanks to the inspired writing of the author. Really recommended for anyone that even remotely likes chess history and/or biographies. Furthermore, the book has a good selection of games, the majority of them with analysis by Euwe himself. It is a paperback, but aside from that, production is first rate, clear text and diagrams. Cons? Well, no hardcover as I said, and only if this had all known Euwe games, with analysis, it would be 5 stars."
2,"Many facts, but many factoids, too.","When I read this book years ago, I found the information therein just as the title states: fascinating. But upon further perusing of this work, I began to notice incorrect information presented as fact. For example, the deer botfly does NOT fly at the stated high speed; that fanciful notion came from a quote by etymologist Charles H. T. Townsend. His absurd estimation was proven false by Irving Langmuir.I've also found information in this book that contradicts ""facts"" elsewhere in the book. And the statistics cited from years ago are often out of date and inaccurate. I recommend this title only if you are willing to verify some of its information against other sources and have a keen ability to distinguish between fact and fascinating fiction -- however plausible it might seem."
2,"Grrr... Argh - Not all ""facts"" listed are true!","This would be a good book if it didn't make false claims. For example: You CANNOT ""see stars during the day from the bottom of a well"" - this is an urban legend.I find it disturbing from other comments that people dig this book out as ""proof"" of certain things, which are NOT TRUE.Don't except anything on faith - even if its written in a book."
3,A good read but you could find better!,"I don't want to appear to negative as overall, this is an interesting book, but in some parts it was a bit ordinary.Some of the facts were truly amazing but some of the facts were merely just statistics so they weren't really of great interest. Since these statistics were based on the 1970's or 1980's, they are no longer current even though they may have been facts when first published. Research and technology have also appeared to disprove some facts as well.Overall, it's OK but I prefered the trivia book by Isaac Asimov."
3,Worthless knowledge is good for me! :),I enjoyed reading this book although I wish they had one more up to date. I learned a lot of fascinating facts.
5,Interesting!,"This book was pretty good. I enjoy weird fact books and this is one of my favorites. I have used this book for school projects which I got A's on because of the interesting facts. For instince, two tribes in the world are the only ones known not to use fire?! And if you pore a minute amount of liquor on a scorpion it will instantly go mad and sting itself to death."
2,"For a Journey to Skepticism, Start Here","When I was a kid, I used to have this book called 2201 Fascinating Facts. Over years, I have learned that least several hundred entries were misconception, urban legend, or complete fabrication. Funny how a young person can accept what is ""truth"" after reading only one book.Misleading, ridiculous and far from factual; I still credit this book for kicking off a long path to critical thinking and healthy skepticism."
1,Book - not thrilled with quality.,Disappointed when I received the book. Immediately threw the cover away due to water damage or mold (could not detect). Wondering to keep the book not knowing the damage to it - did not occur in transit.
3,Fun,"Fun facts, but some well known facts. I did not buy this book for well known facts. Worth buying at a low price."
3,Searching for the strange,"Not as good as I would have liked. Living here in Ireland I am on a constant quest on the net to find books on strange, unusual and odd facts for a world project I'm involved in so if any reader of this can recommend books on same subject please e-mail me.....I will let you know details back.......Kevin (Ireland) at kilk@tinet.ie......Many thanks."
3,tune up your spanish,"given the other ALL 5 star reviews..I ordered this book. I have many spanish cd's and books. I'd say I am no beginner, possibly intermediate??? This book is for beginners. Maybe not people who can't count to 10, but a beginner none-the-less. Spend your money on pimsleur and you'll be happier (or better yet borrow pimsleur from the library)...I'd say a 3 star rating from me was generous."
3,I've bought 5 of these!! they go KAPOOT on you!!,"Okay at first loved this even purchased the one with more memory 128 and the little window, however after some time they just up and die on you!! in fact I have 4 of these sitting in my car at this very minute that have all just died???? I'm going to get a box and send them all out to Phillips because this was ridiculous. I would recommend doing some major investigating for all the MP 3 players out there I have had my collection for about 2 years now. The arm band is handy, they are small enough not to get in your way, it holds enough music for a hour work out, down loading the music is fairly simple once you get the hang of it, but sometimes (it may just be my computer) the computer doesn't recognize that is it there.Oh yea and the rubber buttons can become a challenge to press down on you end ruining the face of the player because sometimes you'll have to use your finger nails which eventually cuts into the rubber.Respectfully reviewed"
1,The only exersize will be when you throw it against the wall,"Against the advice of the reviews I read on Amazon, I purchased this unit because there are not that many sports MP3 players. After six hours of trying to download songs to the device, I finally was able to get a few songs on though I have no idea how to do again. The real problem is the Musicmatch software which is very unstable. While it works fine for burning cds, not so for downloading to this device.Now that I have some songs on it, I have to say the quality is good and the armband works well.Would I recommend buying this unit? Yes, if your idea of exercise is burning calories through frustration and anger. If not, you would be better off humming while you run."
1,Not sure how to rate something i couldnt use..,Having a hard time review something i couldnt use. When i recieved it the back was broken so i returned it. Took them a month to tell me they were out of stock. This company has bad comunication skills. One person told me it was in the mail. Then another person tells me their sold out. Now lets see how long it takes them to get me my refund.
2,Hardly any memory - too outdated for new PCs,"Compared to other mp3 players, this is a piece of crap. Yes, it works, but it only holds about 30 songs, and when you go on a long run, it loops! How annoying. I ran a half marathon with this and heard all the songs 3 times!Also when we bought a new PC, it wouldn't connect because it's so old."
1,Horrible experience - do not buy this,"Simply stated - this product just isn't compatible with XP. Even if it installs correctly it will fail after a period of the player sitting idle or the player batteries running down.Technical support is a joke, they have a ""customer is always wrong attitude"" if you can reach them.This thing may, or may not, work for you but I don't recommend taking the risk."
5,A Marvelous Book!,"Few military ""picture books"" have given me as much unexpected pleasure as this one. Having bought it by mail on the basis of its subject matter alone, I was very pleasantly surprised when it not only met - but exceeded - my expectations. Lavishly (dare I say beautifully) illustrated by abundant carefully selected and wonderfully reproduced photos and charts, it exhaustively covers almost all aspects of the Canadian soldier in Northwest Europe in the final year of World War II. The succinct text (written in homage by French authors, but adequately transcribed into English) provides a good outline against which to appreciate this visual material. While the treatment of any individual subject may not be as deep as that found in books dediciated to a specific topic, I can confidently say that no one single volume provides as much useful information as this one does!"
3,Money well spent,"The only reliable and functionally satisfying aspect of my Tasco Stargate 114 telescope is the little white light that illuminates the key pad. Considering the amount of Australian dollars (Money) spent, I now feel my recreation money would had been better spent wiring ten trillion little white lights and transmitting photons towards aliens."
2,How to remove the black carboard lens cover from front cover,I purchase this scope on 12/22/01 and was setting it up. It tells were you can align with your eyeball while some else adjust the front lenseMine has a piece of black paper in side and I would like to removed it.Thanks for listening.
2,"Great looker, but not much else","Pros:- The wallet and chain looks pretty cool and a number of my friends have complimented on it.- The pocket chain is really good.Cons:- Really small. If you have a lot of cards - hell even a lot of cash, it'd bulge and be a tight fit.- No coin purse.- I've been using the wallet between April and October. From that short period of use, threads have come out and the hole surrounded with a metal ring (which is used to attach the pocket chain) has torn out from the wallet (not completely, but it will with extended use).Conclusion: A very good looking but impractical wallet, probably good enough for a kid who doesn't have much cards, has no use for a coin purse and who wouldn't use it very often."
4,Very good target for the price but not good for .44 mag,"Holds up great to 45, 40, and 9mm. However my .44 magnum dimpled the target rather severely at 40 yards out. Even though they say it can take .44 be very wary. You may end up with some nasty damage to your target."
3,Smaller than expected,Not a bad target but a lot smaller than I thought about a foot tall and 8 inches wide. Not bad for less than 20 bucks
4,Spinning Target,"Sturdy little target. Family appreciated the sound and sight feedback when we scored a hit. When bright paper fails I recommend spraying it with bright paint. It has to be far away so it's not destroyed, but I think it should be larger so that beginners can score more positive feedback about their shooting skills. Otherwise A+."
5,Holds up well against large caliber pistols,"Received this two weeks ago and took it out to the range the following weekend. I put 400 rounds of .45 caliber ammunition on it that day, and the target held up beautifully. The supports and the target itself show no wear aside from the marks the bullets left behind. It definitely will hold up long term.I do suggest you build some sort of stand for it, since the entire target stands maybe 2.5 feet tall. Also, depending on how solid the soil is, it's possible for the target to lean backward after many hits. This is easily fixed though. Some steel tubing and feet, and the target would be perfect. Even still, it's well worth the money."
3,Let's Be Honest....,"This movie is not good and should be purchased only by Coppola or Raul Julia completists. There's a couple of good movies in here, but instead of teling the story of either Julia's nutty Ray or Kinski's sexy circus performer, Coppola chooses to focus on boring Garr and Forrest. The movie has gorgous sets, and terrific perfomences from its supporting cast, but you're unlikely to want to see this again and again, thanks largely to the banal, imporvised dialogue that causes the main story to make little sense. The DVD treatment is fantastic though, and better than the film deserves."
3,DVD is a disappointment,"The theatrical release of ""One from the Heart"" was indeed groundbreaking. While the story and characters were not terribly riveting and the musical numbers were a bit uninspired, its stylized sets and homage to classic Hollywood musical revues were a 1980's cinematic treat. And the colors were electrical and dazzling. Eye candy in a way that makes ""Moulin Rouge"" (despite its nervous, attention-deficit cinematography) look derivative.The DVD release, however, misses the mark. The lavish sets nearly disappear on the typical home screen. The effect is similar to watching ""2001"" in TV format. ""One from the Heart"" is an eye-popping big-screen film and does not translate well to most home theaters."
4,Definitely better than critics' convention wisdom,"I just saw this at the Castro Theater in San Francisco, where probably the worst dog of a movie would seem great, but this was very enjoyable. I loved this movie when it came out in 1982 or thereabouts and could never figure out why critics blasted it so unfairly. Coppola had worked himself into a persona non grata in Hollywood; the critics were mouthing that hatred--that's all I could figure.Seeing it now, this would probably fall into the ""art film"" category, but it features some great dialogue and compelling performances by Forrest and Garr, with Raul Julia and Natassja Kinski playing more ethereal roles. Kinski is filmed beautifully. It's a beautiful film, period. The music and Vegas sets are wonderful. You miss it as soon as it's over.Rich and visually exciting...perhaps not 5 stars, but then again this film just doesn't conform easily to any rating system."
3,One from the Heart,Too realist to be enjoyed very much. We all know a couple very much this the one in this movie.
4,Gone from the charts - but not from MY HEART,"The first time I saw this movie was at an ""art film"" festival. From the opening credits and scene with the long slow panoramic journey through Las Vegas, and the soulful soundtrack - I knew that I was in for an entertaining movie. The incredible use of lighting, images and stage blends with the sounds of Crystal Gale to produce an awesome experience.- Now all I have to do is FIND A COP -"
2,It is a animal clipper and,it is easy to be broken.very weakI did not know that this clipper is for animal.
4,Initial Use,"My daughter used it for the first time this weekend in a game. She did do a couple of headers with it on and said that she did notice a difference for the better. It does take some time to get use to and to get it fitted correctly. However, the safety and security that it provides is well worth it. Two team members have had concussions this season. The coach and all the players agreed that they will wear this headgear for the remainder of season and evaluate it's effectiveness at the end."
3,Soccer Headgear Premier,"It may have worked well, but they sent the wrong one it was a full 90 but not the premier but a lower model and kept falling off during the game. No problem getting a return."
1,Read if you are on edge sizewise between sm/med and large,"Concept in theory is good and I have read research that shows it ""may"" help decrease head trauma. My head measured 22.5"", the cut off for sm/med is 22"", I decided to get the large. I couldn't get it to stay on, even with a ponytail which I would think would help hold it in place. I didn't wear it to play in because I had worn it for about 45 minutes just around the house to see if I could get it to stay, when I finally had it tight enough and in a position that it didn't slide up...I took it off after about 15 minutes and man was it sore, right in the spot where you should head the ball. I will order the sm/med to see if it fits any better and do a review of it too."
2,Headgear not for us,The head piece is what we ordered but doesn't stay on my daughter's head. It slips. We have tried many types and will need to search for something else that does not slip off.
3,Hard to fit properly,Great idea but we can't seem to get it to stay on properly without constantly feeling like it is going to fall off. Emailed for help but they didn't seem to care.
5,safe,The full90 headgear is a wonderful addition to the soccer uniform. It is comfortable and I feel secured that my daughter has the protection needed in rough situations.
1,Extremely disappointed,I purchased this rice cooker in late March. I used it once and it worked OK. Went to use it again today (April 28th) and the button kept switching to warm before the water even came to a boil. I have been using rice cookers for about 25 years. I loved my old Hitachi cooker but it looks like they no longer make them.
4,Good Rice Cooker!!!!,"I have had this rice cooker for a few years. Every batch was cooked through evenly and perfectly every single time. This cooker also held up well to differnt varieties of rice and different grains!!Unfortunately today the machine is broken, the cook feature no longer works. Which is the only hesitation I have in purchasing another one."
1,"NOT very happy, received a bad one, replacement only worked 18 months","I was so exited to get a new rice cooker, my last one lasted about 10 years and cooked amazing rice; after searching for a replacement,I found that Zojirushi was the best brand, so I decided to buy one. When it arrived, it worked once and the nothing; On a good note I got a replacement rather quickly.The replacement worked OK for a few months; but kept under-cooking the rice, not sure why; unless it had to do with how I go about cooking the rice, since I first put a little oil and garlic, wait for it to get hot, so the oil has time to get infused with the garlic, the I introduce the rice, stir; then the water (this method worked perfectly with my old rice cooker)about a week ago, it burned the rice, and stopped working altogether.Not sure if I had bad luck, but I will not be buying this brand again"
2,"Just an ""ok"" book","The book is cute EXCEPT the words ""I think she'll die. "" on every other page. I always skip that part when reading it to my kids. Without that, it would be a cute book."
4,Cute spin on a classic song,"This is a cute story that is a classic kids rhyming song now made into a clever, new short book for kids. My daughter loved it and I enjoyed it too."
5,A delightful read a loud,If you want to get children excited and howling in delight this is a book to read out loud to a 2nd or 3rd grade class every Thanksgiving. The children I read this book to were wild with excitement about the absurdity of the situation but still somewhat believing it could happen. It strikes a chord of the wonderful open minds of a 7 or 8 year old child.
2,"Just okay,","I have read several of these books in this series and I find this my least favorite by far. Infact if it had been the first one I had read, I am not so sure I would have kept reading the rest.I know an old Lady Who Swallowed a Bat, is one of our favorites. along with the original.This one just doesn't flow well for me and the kids just didn't seem as interest. Perhaps the age group was too young, 3 and 4 year olds, maybe 5 to 7 year olds would enjoy it more.The order is Dry pie, cider, roll, squash, salad, turkey, pot, cake, (ten-layer cake), bread, the ending ends up with her saying, ""Happy Thanksgiving,"" and being floated in a parade as a big giant balloon. She gets fatter as she eats each item.the pictures don't do a whole lot for me either in this book. Just not my favorite."
5,Fabulous!,"I Know An Old Lady Who Swallowed A Pie is one of the best find for the Thanksgiving holiday. This is an adapation of the old classic rhyme, I Know An Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly, with a Thanksgiving twist. She eats and eats until she blows up like a balloon, and flies in the Thanksgiving parade. It's hysterical, and little ones love it. The cadence is wonderful, and a blast to read aloud!Judy Schachner's illustrations are colorful, and silly, somewhat like Nadine Bernard Wescott's [The Farmer Brown Series, Lady With The Alligator Purse]. If you're looking for a hilarious book for young children say 3 to 7 then this may fit the bill."
5,Hilariously funny!,"My daughter loves this book. It's one of her favorites that's read over and over again. We still laugh when we read it and look at the little old lady's teeny-tiny feet. The hilarious illustrations in this book tell a story of their own. This is one of those ""must haves"" for your child's library."
1,A Waste of Paper,"The old lady swallows some CRAZY stuff (which hopefully doesn't give any daring children any ideas!), and several times the author writes ' Maybe she'll die' or something about her dying. Not only does the CHILDREN'S BOOK (for very young children)talk about dying, but there is no moral or lesson to the story! Needless to say, there are other books that are a lot better in a lot of ways (Storyline, Lessons-Learned & Illustration). I do not recommend this book."
4,Not sure of content,My daughter loves this book. It has great pictures and so-so rhymes. Not sure of the content as to asking if old lady will die every other page. I guess my daughter needs to learn about death at some point
3,Thanksgiving Version of old classic,"This was so-so. The illustrations were the best part, but even those didn't capture my four-year-old's attention that much. He hasn't asked for it again."
5,A VERY SOLID BIT OF WRITING AND A CLASSIC,"I first read this one well over 40 years ago and am not ashamed to admit that I reread it every few years. It has a Strong story, strong characters and is simply well written. Warning: This is not the story found in the awful movies and TV series of recent years. Yes, the films do have animals, but that is about as close as they get. This is a good, clean read for any one of any age, told my a master story teller. There were a group of writers that came out of the late 50s and early 60s who all turned out work of this calibre, and Norton was one of them. Anyone interested in the evolution of SiFi (Fantasy?) writing needs to give this work a close look. So much of what has been turned out over the past 20 years has been directly influenced by this and the other works of it's ilk. Recommend this one highly and recommend you purchase it and add it to your collection."
4,Wagner!,"Mariss Jansons, the conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic made a wonderful interpretation of Wagner's great works. The orchestra has a sound unsurpassed by few. Being a brass fan and player, this is a good album to have. It demonstrates virtuostic sound and style.A fan of Wagner or not, you will be pleased with the extraordinary performance given by the Oslo Philharmonic."
1,Wrong book.,"I received the wrong book, and therefore had to return the item. Return shipping was much more expensive from my country, but I was not paid back the total costs of what the return shipping cost me. Overall it took a lot of my time and money."
4,Substantial Book !,"With what books cost these days,this a very nice art book covering most eras and the more important works of art though out history."
1,never again,"I purchased (or rather tried to purchase) this book with CD for my daughter and have it shipped to her for her college course. The first book arrived unsealed, no CD, no student guide. I called, the first customer service rep suggested I tried to find the CD on my own on-line and purchase it seperately. I called back and the second customer service rep agreed to send a new set and emailed me the return lable for the first book. SURPRISE! second book came unsealed and without the CD or student guide. They are both going back. I ended up buying the book directly from the publisher and it was less than was listed at Amazon. Plus, the publisher told me that the CD is packed inside the book. The only way it would have been missing is that someone esle bought the book and returned it, keeping the CD and then Amazon resold the book as new. Totally disgusted with the whole thing."
3,Book in condition that was stated but too long on the delievery,"The book came as described by the seller and the CD that comes with the book is has great resources for studying the chapters but I have never waited so long for a book to arrive from amazon, I ordered on the first week of my class and I got it the third week into my class which wasn't very helpful to me"
5,A Big Beautiful Art Book!,"This is a beautiful art history book! I just finished an art history class. We used a different edition (Gardner's ""concise history"", a smaller paperback edition). That book was a smaller paperback, not as detailed as this edition. I will always look online from now on because I bought this bigger better book to keep on amazon for less than I rented the text from the school bookstore! Gardner's book are interesting and readable! I will happily have this on hand to refer to in the future and browse when I feel like it! A treasure!Gardner's Art through the Ages (with ArtStudy Student CD-ROM and InfoTrac)"
2,okay book,Cons: This book is not that bad but it doesn't have a very good explaination for anyone who take intro class. I read this book and another book call Essential of Human Anatomy & Physiology by Elaine N. Marieb. The A&P; by Elaine is much easier to understand...Pros: This book is very organized picture & table (not text)
5,Essentials of Anatomy & Physiology (5th Edition),"I think this book is structured to be at a higher level of conceptualization, and it contains materials that are relevant and essential to students."
5,I received the book in excellent condition,"At first, I hesitated in ordering the book, but I ordered it anyways and now I am glad I did. The book came perfectly packed and in excellent condition."
5,A&P,"Book uses to many complicated words to explain simple concepts. would not reccomend for a beginner of A&P overall it is an excellent book, the diagrams are very helpfull in helping you to understand the the different functions of the human body"
3,Essentials of Anatomy & Physiology (5th Edition),"Received book after 18 days of purchase. Delivery was fine except the delivery person left it on the front door of the apartment complex in the snow. The package was soaked and so was part of the book. Book condition was decent, the edges were worn and some of the pages were ripped slightly. Overall it was in decent condition."
1,Did not get the product,"I brought the book but didn't get the book from the seller. I contact the seller, four times and got only one reply back from the seller. He told me ""It should be on the way. I apologize for the sloppy service of UPS. I will contact them and in turn you"", and it might have been a problem with the ups. The other three email,that I sent to the seller told him that I didn't recieved the book. I'm still didn't hear from the seller, so I contact Amazon. The customser service told me that they'll try to get my money back. I recomented everyone that do not buy your product from this sell Daniel Laurie."
4,Good horror movie. Keeps you interested.,"""The Ruins"" kept me sitting on the edge of my seat, and anticipating what would happen next. No other horror movie, except ""The Descent"" held my interest like this one. I must admit, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is. The hopelessness of the situation and ending ran along the same lines in both movies. If you don't think plants can be things of terror, this movie might change your mind. There are other horrors, as well, and they are very real. As with ""The Descent"", I didn't especially like the ending here, but the actors played their characters well. One of the best horror movies I've seen."
3,evil creature + humans for food = decent horror,"The evil creature in this flick is the star and everyone else is just there to be fed upon. Things are not going to work out well for our humans, but seeing their plight is enjoyable for horror fans. This was a decent horror flick that I was glad I bought."
4,good if you like a little gore,"This is a pretty good horror movie. There's a different villain. There is some gore for slasher fans. The acting is pretty good too. Once you get past the first 15 minutes, you are in for a ride."
1,An hour and a half poorly spent,"By the time this grisly, torture-porn flick is over, I found myself rooting for the killer vines to just kill the whole party and get it over with. I am rarely offended by violent or gory content, and I can't say that I was here, but the blood and violence was frequently gratuitous and usually unnecessary. I went into the film with low expectations, and the film merely confirmed those expectations. Acting is average, and effects are OK for those who don't lose interest after the first half hour. Fortunately, I was working on something on my laptop at the time, so I can at least count that hour and a half of my life as not being completely wasted."
2,Only for true horror fanatics looking for a fix.,"The Ruins showed great promise when I first watched it, and it certainly did horrify and disgust me, but it failed in other ways. I didn't care a bit about any of the characters, so it didn't matter to me if they lived or died. The plot was a little flimsy (where did those particular plants come from? what made them act like that?), but they did stick to it pretty well, I think. And the effects were top-notch. But after watching it the one time, I haven't wanted to see it again, and one of the ways I know if I like a horror movie is if it leaves me wanting to watch it over to get all the nuances. This one just didn't to that. It was a one-time thing. I think more could have been done with the special effects, and the actors could have tried to build a little more rapport with each other."
2,Not What I Expected!!!,"Seriously, I didn't know if this was going to be a slasher, or with a supernatural. It turns out, it has possessed plants dragging people and getting beneath their skin. Whenever they have to cut the plants out of people, it was pretty gory and nerve-wracking! I wouldn't recommend THE RUINS!!!"
2,A bad book gets worse,"The film version of ""The Ruins"" is a classic example of ""not as good as the book"". Unfortunately, the book wasn't that great, either. By isolating the story in one small geographic area (really, just one ""ruin""), writer Scott Smith increases the despair of his characters, but also limits where the narrative can go. The main antagonist lacks the sinister, deliberate quality that it had in the book, making it seem somewhat more incidental than the secondary antagonist(s). Without giving too much away, Smith never explains the theory of ""why"" they are trapped, as in the book, so it feels less satisfying. Ultimately, it gets the Hollywood treatment, with a different ending, the omission of a crucial character (his lines/actions are given to other members of an already large protagonistic cast), and a final feeling of ""that's it?""."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!,"I usually don't have the time or energy to write a review...but in this case, it is necessary. It takes a lot for me to HATE a movie. There almost always something that makes it ok...not in this movie. I want my hour and a half back. Trust me, everyone who gave it one star nailed it! Only one other movie ticked me off this bad: Hope Floats. The book is probably good. I enjoy books with this type of plot... the movie however tanks. It ruined my night. (pun intended)Avoid!"
2,Read the book instead,"The book ""The Ruins"" by Scott Smith is a great horror story, full of menace and a sense of dread but the film version doesn't achieve this atmosphere. Although quite faithful to the book (Smith also wrote the screenplay), the filmmakers seem more interested in seeing how graphic they can get with the leg amputations and self-mutilation scenes. There are a few good creepy moments, like when the girls discover that the cell phone ringing is something else entirely, but those moments are rare. The acting is good and the sets are impressive but the movie isn't scary, which is what the main premise of a horror film should be."
2,Creepy creepers!,"A handful of attractive american students in peril while on vacation in the wilderness. Sound familiar? That's because this is. There's nothing new here, sadly, and I struggled to take the movie at all seriously. I've always had a problem with killer plant life, and the concept is no less comical here, despite the goriness. The characters are uninteresting, the plot almost non-existent, and the pay-off a huge letdown. It just about holds the attention for the 90 minutes it's on the screen but will be gone from your memory in about 90 seconds once it's ended."
3,"""The Ruins"" isn't that great, but it's not bad","""The Ruins"" is a pretty good horror movie. It's nothing absolutely amazing, but I wouldn't say it's bad. The opening scene of the movie make it seem like it's going to be scary and cool. The beginning is pretty slow, but once the characters get to the pyramid, it gets pretty intense. The movie has a sense of panic that makes the movie even more intense. The whole ""flesh-eating vines"" thing is kind of weird, but it's unique, also, since nobody ever really did that a horror film before. ""The Ruins"" also gets pretty gruesome after an hour. The grossest scene is this leg amputation scene (bloody!). It just gets bloodier from on there. The ending is also intense, and to be honest, it ends pretty well, with just a little cliffhanger. You might as weel see ""The Ruins"" because it's not that bad of a movie."
3,"Adequate but shallow, The Ruins is a decent rental.","Let's get the negatives out of the way early. Yes, as some have mentioned, there are attractive people doing stupid things. Character development is pretty much nil. But that being said, as a fan of all thinks dark and gory, I had a good time watching this film. The gore isn't constant, but when it is used it is very effective..the surgery scene is as bad as anything I've seen on film, including the so-called ""torture porn"" genre. Some other reviewers mock ""The Ruins"" for having a plant as it's monster, but I thought that it was cool and not something I'd seen before. And for being the stereotypical teens who will die, the cast was game and delivered better acting than I'm used to seeing in these kinds of films. Due to the problems listed up top, I can't highly recommend it...I don't even think I'll buy it myself unless I see it at a pawn shop.....but it's a solid rental if you're a fan of the genre."
4,quite a nice job,"I sometimes search for horror films in Amazon so I have a breif memory about this file so when I see this DVD i just bought it.I don't remember any of this film plotline so I had no expectations at all when I started watching it.Story turned out to be very sad, special effects were quite good, plays were good, especially whom called 'stace' in the movie, acted really up to the level. Of course the rest of the actors were not bad either.Funny thing is I watched this one and there was this 20 something year old girl beside me also watching (from China), she puked after several gore scenes... seems not many China people have experienced movies like, the thing, braindead, the fly, the beyond....;-)"
1,A Terrible Horror Flick,"Caught the film on HBO last night,I admit seeing the veins mimicing the sound of a cell phone and peoples screaming was crazy,but the whole plot of the movie and it's trying to scare viewers didn't work! Just a gross out terrible pointless horror movie!"
3,Sincere acting keeps this movie from tanking,"lets face it, killer vegatation isn't high on the list of most horrifying things that can kill you. But, this cast manages to keep a straight face. Not great but not terrible either. Mild chills, nothing that will keep you awake though. Enjoy."
4,Buying Made Easy,This was one of the easiest purchases that I have made in a while.I love the movie as well.I will purchase from Amazon again.
4,Not As Good As The Brilliant Novel But Still Pretty Cool,"Not much to add to my title up there. I'm sure you know what The Ruins is about, so see it, it's worth the time. But better yet, read the novel!"
2,Little shop of Horrors 2,"Man, I had no idea they were going to make a sequel of ""little shop of horrors"". It only took them twenty years to cook this up. That is too quick in my opinion. These things take time. If only Rick Moranis wasn't shooting ""brother bear 2"" when they were creating this gem, it would have been perfect. ""Ghostbusters 2""? ""brother bear 2""? come on Moranis, don't forget where you came from. Please start filming ""My Blue Heaven 2"". Please, please.Seriously, killer plants?"
4,All atmosphere here,"First things first. this is an atmospere horror film. not a monster running around tearing people apart. Dont get me wrong there is plenty og grizzly images to be found in this film.A group of Friend on vacation get stuck due to missing passports. to pass the time thay decide to visit a new found friends brother who excavating an old mayan ruin. Once they get there they find nowone but locals who will not allow them to leave under threat of death. They friends soon find that the locals are afraid of something evil, something living in the ruis or perhaps the ruins spirit itself.I enjoyed the film quit a bit but its not for gore-fest fans of slaughter and mayhem. its all atmophere here."
3,Not great but really not all that bad; effective enough horror,"I've seen far better horror films, such as The Descent and both the American and Japanese versions of The Ring/Ringu, but The Ruins isn't all that bad either.It's got the usual recipe for disaster: young people in an unfamilar place, bored, looking for fun and adventure, making silly mistakes that get them into a terrible and tragic situation. This one happens to involve some ancient ruins, a hostile tribe that won't let the youngsters leave the ruins, and some rather creepy and dangerous foliage.I should warn you that this unrated version gets quite bloody at times, but that's to be expected.Don't pay too much to rent it, but if you and your friends like some bloody fun that doesn't tax your brain too much, rent this."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"Based on one of the best selling graphic novels of all-time, The Ruins, has a lot to like, and a lot to dislike. Following the classic horror movie format, there is a ton of eye candy and gore, always a good thing. The plot isn't very strong thou. It was a great book and there was a lot to go on, but sadly the movie ignores it. You see a lot of things, but unlike the book, nothing is really explained. This movie is all visual. They focus almost entirely on the gore, and not the story, making The Ruins just another typical horror movie. A good horror movie mixes a truly scary story, with shock, awe, and beautiful people. That's the formula, and while The Ruins should have been all those things, it really wasn't."
3,creepy,Be nice to your plants or this could happen to you. Good movie to watch not to gory just creepy
1,Plus and Minus,"On the plus-side, the film only lasts 90-minutes (and this is the 'unrated' version) and has a remote and interesting setting (although it's not presented very convincingly), but on the minus-side, was the story worth telling in the first place? For me, the answer is, NO!"
1,Most disappointing movie ever!,"Do you know what would have been scarier than a bunch of man-eating plants!? ANYTHING! I was so incredibly disappointed in this movie that I wanted to cry. I saw the movie in a theater and I almost wish a vine had wrapped around my foot and eaten me alive there. Wow. Of all the possible villains that could have been created, they chose killer plants."
1,boring,If you are tight on money do not waste it on this movie. I felt ripped off even though I only spent $5. This movie is boring and the plot is just blah. I was so bored I do not even know how to express it in words.
1,Awful Movie,"Very terrible movie. Do not waste your money on this. Picture this: 4 people are stranded with killer vines attacking them. They have fire, and plenty of fuel (alcohol) to burn the vines. Yet, they never do this. Instead, a really inane movie occurs. Horrible actors, just plain awful. Insipid characters who are impossible to care about. Avoid at all costs. Even if someone offers to pay you to see this."
2,Read the book!,"I took some fellow reviewers advice and read the book first. In fact, I watched the movie the same night I finished the book. What a letdown!!! The movie here can not come close to the silver screen of your imagination.What can I say? Though it started out following fairly closely to the story, it didn't take long for it to diverge. Much of what made reading the book so good was getting into the mind of each character. Plus-it seemed so much of what made the story so scary and fraught with tension was absent here.Of course, I could be too sensitive, having just finished up the 509 pg book which I'd read over 3 intense days.I did like to see the ruins fleshed out on the screen. But for true shivers, pick up a copy of the book."
3,The Longest Day (of the Triffids),"I don't know that I expected much and it certainly seemed to sink without trace at the cinema but it's way above average.It's a character-driven horror story for once, not one of those unrelentingly mindless rehashes of Asian stories.How do you make a horror story in broad daylight, atop a pyramid? This is how. It's claustrophobic and this is emphasised by the brilliant use of widescreen. For my money it plays more like a drama than a horror story but that's just fine since the film is populated by believable people with believable lines. I'm not sure about the premise of the plant life and the end is formulaic - no-one here gets out alive. You do get a choice of endings to sweeten things up a little.It's hard not to root for the characters so to speak. It doesn't seem to have the mounting sense of hopelessness that The Descent did but it stands head and shoulders above The Happening. However, B Minus rather than B Plus but still very well worth a look."
1,Don't Lagh; the Ruins is a seriously bad movie,I couldn't remember hearing about this movie when It came out. Now I know why. Its no wonder the theaters canned it after the first few days.One of the worst movies of all time. Save your money.
2,Horror movie with not much of suspense,"Ok, so I guess they ran out of horror ideas and they decided to make ""plants"" scary. That's right, this movie is about scary plants. Plants that would lure you then kill you.A group of American college students go to Mexico and decide to visit an ancient pyramid, only to discover that the villagers wouldn't accept to let them leave the temple and forced them to stay on it (apparently they became infected). On the temple, they start getting attacked by vicious plants!Instead of having enough suspense in this movie, we are faced with disgusting chopping of legs and pulling plants from bodies scenes. That's not cool!!"
3,Not very horrific,"The Bottom Line:Plants are just not a very cinematic villain (part of the reason The Happening was so ludicrous) and no matter how good the other aspects of the film are I just can't be scared by the plight of people who are about to be vined, if you will; The Ruins gets points for bothering to develop its characters a little and not being a remake of a J-horror, but it's just not a very good film.2.5/4"
5,Comentario Biblico Internacional,"One of the best comentaries I have seen in Spanish. I do not know how can so many writers and authors get together to write one book! This is not your regular comentary; this is from people who know to people who know. I love the articles about the translation of the Bible, pastoral aids, the Bible and arqueology, and the fact that it has the books included in the catholic Bible. You need in your bookshelf!"
1,Do not get the Versapak Dusbuster model,"The Versapak never worked on our Dustbuster, the batteries would never charge right, so I had to use my husband's cordless screwdriver battery charger once a week to get the batteries up and running again. I should have returned it right away, but didn't.My family has used Dusbuster for years and have found all their other products to be excellent. However, the incorporation of the Versapak did nothing for that reputation. Spend less and use the 7.2 V model V7210."
1,Worthless,"The character yells, runs through rooms, hasn't one refinement to herself, and has a standard of living so unrealistic for her income, not just beyond typical ""Hollywood"" nonsense of 1966, but in her person, that it was to watch madness. Her lack of the most basic manners alone would have then and would today destroy any opportunities in her life.That Girl is a loser. I found it as a nostalgic moment to be worthless.In some cases, ""Hollywood"" is doing much finer work today than it did in yesteryear. I recommend Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life) in its place."
1,Does this make any sense?,Why are the DVD fairies wasting their time working on releasing only a part of Season 1 when the ENTIRE first season has already been released and is currently avaiable for anyone and everyone who wants to acquire it. Would it have not seemed more logical to spend their time and effort working on getting Season 4 ready to be released for those of us who are presently still waiting????
1,Buy Season 1,"If you are curious about That Girl, you should skip merely buying this DVD since it's only the first DVD in the boxset and get Season 1 of That Girl. You must behold the Impeccable hair of Ted Bessell"
1,Paper clip holder,"The item was great. However, as one can see, the item is about 4 x 2 inches. It was shipped in a box 2 feet x 1 foot and I paid the postage. It was absolutely wasteful and ridiculous. It could have been sent in a padded envelope and been much more conservative."
1,questionable safety,"I just bought the carseat today, and after an hour of struggling to install it safely so there is minimal movement, I gave up. I tried both the latch system and the car seatbelt and couldn't find a way of securing it. Also, in rear facing position the recline handle becomes hard to reach. I am going to return it for another brand."
2,BIG!!!!,"This carseat looked so comfortable and when we put our son into it, he seemed to like it and it fit him so well! But when we got it home and tried to install it!!!!!!! This thing is ***HUGE*** We have a Chevy Blazer and an '05 Dodge Ram Quad Cab and this car seat will not fit in either of the trucks! I had to move the passenger seats all the way forward and sitting up straight in order to fit the car seat in. It would not fit in the center because then I would have to move both the driver's seat and the passenger seats up! If you had a mini-van or something that had a large back seat, you probably won't have any problems.It was also a pain to install! I tried to install it in the Blazer, but I couldn't get the seat belt tight(no LATCH) because where I would put my knees in the seat it where the belt has to run under the padding. You may have better luck with the LATCH.I am now looking for a seat that my 20lbs, 27inch tall, 4 month old will be able to use! Good Luck!"
3,horrible installation,"this car seat looks great. my daughter was very comfortable in it in the store. we took it home and optimistically went to install it in my ford escape. no can do. my husband and i tried for over an hour to get the LATCH system to tighten...in all the LATCH positions. the thing never tightened...no matter what we tried. and the car seat was never in the ""parallel to the ground"" mode it was supposed to be in. i had read the reviews for this car seat in the other pattern and stupidly thought we would not have the same installation problems. buy this car seat if you drive a huge car with non-slanted seats. back to the drawing board for us....."
1,DO NOT BUY COSCO BRAND PRODUCTS!,Do not buy Cosco Brand products. Their customer service lacks. The chest harness broke on our car seat over 6 weeks ago and they have yet to replace it even though their web site says receive within 7-10 business days. We are out a car seat and have to go buy another.
5,Love this seat!,"I will confess that we bought it after our son was ready for a forward facing seat, so I can't speak to the complaints from others regarding rear facing installation. However, this seat is phenomenal for forward facing. Adjusting both the harness position and tightening/loosening it is so easy compared to others. Our son is extremely comfortable in it and I highly recommend it."
1,cheap & ugly,I thought this would be a fun watch to have for summer and going to the beach. Boy was was I wrong. It is HUGE and ugly and looks like it should cost about $25 from some guy on the street. Don't waste your money. I am returning mine.
5,Couldn't put it down!,Fast-paced action and wit. Great characters. Can't wait for the sequel to come out
4,"a unique approach to telling the story of MLK, Jr.","I'm a huge Faith Ringgold fan. This book is very good as expected, but my only complaint is that it is a little too abstract for the target age group (ages 4-8). For example, the kids were confused at the picture of MLK in jail as an infant and the people burning their ""baggage"". BUT, unique it is... just definitely in need of adult commentary."
5,Facinating book on Martin Luther King Jr.!,Students were very absorbed in this book. They found the story exciting and it stimulated a great discussion. The idea that someone could dream about Martin Luther King Jr. and see him as a child and then as an adult allowed students to think about how different dreams are from reality. Students were anxious to borrow the book and share it with their families.
5,Eye Opening,"I received this book as part of the Wellesley Book Award, and to be honest, I wasn't expecting much. Most of my friends who had received book awards had gotten dictionaries or other books that looked wonderfully useful if one wanted to fall asleep quickly and on the outside this one seemed to be no exception.But then I started reading. The introduction itself is so well written, it could stand alone as an essay on women's writing. And then the selections, oh the selections. The choice and editing of the selections are of such a high quality that you never feel as if you are reading only a selection; each piece is long enough to feel complete. And despite the textbook look, it is engrossing in its diversity and quality of writing.I would recommend this book not only as reading in itself, but also as a jumping-off point. I have marked so many selections that I would like to read in their entirety.Definitely worth the money."
4,Important book of memoirs,"This book has many excerpts from women's memoirs, an important look into how women lived, loved, and worked toward making their lives rich with purpose."
1,Weak plastic handle breaks too easily,"This tool worked great on the first 8 or so bottles, easily extracting the cork. On the last bottle the cork must have been in a bit tighter because the handle split in two right at the top while attempting to extract the cork with only a moderate amount of force. Examining the handle, and the thinness of the plastic at the apex, where the screw fits in, I am surprised this lasted through the first 8 bottles. When I switched to a simple corkscrew the ""tight"" cork came out easily enough. Definitely, imo, a faulty design of the handle mold. The plastic needs to be MUCH thicker where the two handles come together."
1,broke after 10 bottles,"This snapped in half at the top where two sides meet after opening maybe 10 bottles of wine. As other reviewers have mentioned, the foil cutter is also a joke. On a positive note, it was a nice corkscrew while it lasted."
4,Corkscrew works great!,"This product works great. I have tried a couple of other corkscrews that just don't seem to be as easy as this one. Simply put it on the bottle, turn the handle, cork is gone, no effort needed."
2,Stick with the screw pull,Tried to save a few $ on this item. The screw pull with separate foil cutter is much better. The build in foil cutter on this device is useless.
3,Excelent Corkscrew.... while it lasts.,"This is the best ""manual"" corkscrew I have ever used. It has done a great job removing corks from bottles without splitting dried out corks. That is until it broke this evening while I was trying to open a bottle of wine. It was not a particularly tight cork. I think that the plastic where the two ""arms"" come together just fatigued and finally broke. They have a lifetime warranty on it, but you need to send them $5 along with the broken corkscrew to get it replaced. Once you figure $5 - 7 dollars to send the broken one back to them plus the $5 ""return postage"" it is hardly worth returning. I guess I probably will just for the principle of the matter, but it hardly seems like a warranty when it costs me $10 - $12 to have a $15 corkscrew replaced.I see now that other reviewers have had these break at the same location, so there is clearly a design flaw."
4,Great Corkscew For The Money,This is a very nice corkscrew for the money. It removes the cork effortlessly every time.
5,GREAT SHAWL,"This was a lovely addition to my granddaughter's prom dress. It came very promptly, as I was sure it would. I would not hesitate to buy from this seller again. I experienced a great transaction and my granddaugher looked lovely in the shawl.Thank you. Sharon"
1,Don't bother,I was very dissappointed by this item. It arrived folded into a 6X6 square bag and was very creased when opened. It will take considerable pressing to try and get it out. The fabric is too stiff and doesn't drap well. The length isn't long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap. The return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk.
4,Good conducting examples,"The book is a little light on technique but the CD and exercises are very helpful for practicing. I wish it had more ""how to's"" and perhaps an accompanying video, but the CD is helpful."
5,Conducting Skill Explained,"More than just moving the baton, Conducting also uses facial expression, body movement, and the left hand. Not only is Mr. Maiello a great conductor, he is a teacher who can clearly explain each of these skills. And the included music provides constructive practice. Not only is this a good text for students, but experienced conductors would also find it useful."
5,FANTASTIC!,"phenomenal read, its interesting to get to know the men who organized the final revolution from 2,000 miles away. well worth the couple dollars spent."
2,JADED & JILTED,"After three years of having this phone I've finally given up. I recently just replaced my VM4050 for the THIRD time and I had to demand a different type of phone. This last one didn't even make it twenty four hours. This phone will eventually go to pieces on you, do not be confused. No amount of software upgrade will help. My first two began to blank out on me, turn off and on by itself, the menu screens would freeze out and I started receiving text messages two hours after they had been sent. The real music tones are horrible in quality past level two and the phone is generally frustrating. BUYER BEWARE!!"
2,BAD BAD Drop Off Rate,"Hi All;I was dazzaled by the LCD on this phone so much I bought me & my wife a Toshiba. The camera & video took Excellant pics. Within 7 days of having the phone the 'drop-off'rate per minute was horriable. No matter where we went, in stores, in parking lots, on highways, at home etc etc, both phones were loosing between 1-5 seconds of airtime at a rate of about 3-5 times per minute. I'm very sad that this happened cause the video was so great on these phones, but it got to the point that I wanted to throw it against the wall cause of the BAD audio!!!!! I exchanged them within the 14 day return period for a Sanyo 4500 & Samsung A680 with hope the same will not happen"
1,"Great Camera, bad phone.","It has a beautiful screen, takes gorgeous photos, and fairly good videos, it can send them to anyone with an e-mail. A 3 year old can work it. BUT THE GOOD NEWS ENDS THERE!!!The VM4050 never gets more than 2 bars even when you see the cell tower behind the Sprint store. It will randomly cut out in the middle of a call. It will roam expensive analog type towers for $5+ per call. Sprint's own salesmen say it has reception problems!!!!Wish I could honestly recommened it. I exchanged it for a Sanyo PM8200 and its much better. Go for it."
3,Toshiba VM2050,Overall a good phone. When it works. The thing keeps going bad and i have to keep getting new ones from sprint. Im on the third one now. The screen has good resolution. The camera is decent but the video sucks. Bad quality and only fifteen seconds of video. The menus are one of the easiest to use you will find. Very user freindly and easy to use shortcuts are a plus. The ringers are of a decent calibur but not great by any means. Very bad real music tones. Stick with just the polyphonic. I have been happy with its features but not very reliable go with a differnt phone like a moto razar much nicer. Sprint leaves a bad taste in my mouth switching to cingular. peace.
5,everything old is new again,"ladytron is the most exciting band i've heard in a very long time. they make me feel all dizzy and excited and out of breath, sort of like the the first time i heard stereolab. cool, smart bands are so rare in this era of bad, trickle down, ghetto-wannabe pop. ladytron have renewed my faith in youth/pop/whatever culture. i've told everyone i know to listen to them right this minute, but no one's paying attention which, i suppose, is fitting since no one listened to their references either. buy '604,' dance naked on your roof, and taste the magic.(only disappointment is this disc's exclusion of their cover of human league's 'open your heart.' it's a brill reinterpretation.)"
4,New and good,I like the music and the foreign language sampales (I wonder where they find these Biulgarian poems and who the hell is the artist?)!
3,"Seriously, 7 people gave this 5 stars?","This book is fine if you have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever about lupus and have exactly zero background in any sort of science. It's extremely basic, and has a very annoying ""self-help"" feel to it that just had me rolling my eyes every other page. There are much better books out there, written by doctors and psychologists and so on - this is just written by a (rather whiney) woman with lupus. It's a quick read, so worth it if you don't have a lot of time and just want bare minimum information, or you like ""self-help"" sorts of things.. it's more a reassuring sort of book than anything actually helpful."
5,A must have for all lupus patients,"This book helped me so much and I have been diagnosed for over a year. The author explains everything so that it is easy to understand and is very thorough. You are supposed to read the book throughout the year, but it took me four days. It read almost like a novel."
5,Extremely informative,"I really loved this book. It was very informative and it helped me better understand my desease. It also has helped my family members to better support me during flares and different symptoms of Lupus.Easy to read and for an recently diagnosed lupus patient is a great coping tool, it explains symptoms and feelings that you might be experiencing and that you had no idea were related to your Lupus.I recommended it to everyone diagnosed with this desease and anyone who needs to undertasnd what we go through."
4,Good book but not the best,"Great ideas, but his idea of having your desk face the wall with the door behind you is ridiculous. It's definitely bad Feng Shui. Book worth buying, but try Organizing from the Inside Out by Julie Morgenstern and Taming the Paper Tiger at Work by Barbara Hemphill. The computer program for the Paper Tiger that you can buy seperately is definitely worth its weight in gold for those that are information junkies or entrepreneurs."
2,Rain and bugs can get in,"I purchased one of these mailboxes 3 years ago from Home Depot, and I've had enough. I'm on Amazon looking for a new mailbox, and it really frosts me to see this one here.First off, the opening to my mailbox faces west. When there's a driving rain from the west, the mail gets wet. Fail #1.If I'm not around immediately after a driving rain, and the mail gets wet, ants decide to move into the mailbox. Fail #2.If I take my time getting around to the ants, and it's late summer/early fall, yellowjackets were able to get in, and build a nest. Final fail.I want my mailbox to protect my mail from the elements. If it can't do that, why would I want it as a mailbox? Key or not, it doesn't keep my mail safe."
4,A Very Substantial Mailbox,"Design is good. Mine was missing one of the nine screws holding the top in place, but that was easily fixed."
5,Secure Locking Mailbox,"I had another secure mailbox - exactly like this one, just a different color. I loved/love it. The only reason I had to replace it was it was damaged by a hit and run (probably) drunk driver. I received it in a timely manner - just as notified. It is important for me to know that my mail cannot be stolen (it was tampered with - before I got the previous locking mailbox - and also had to have a payroll check stop payment - because of theft. I wouldn't own another type of mailbox. Too easy, sitting out by the curb of the street - for someone to open the mailbox and take your mail. In this day of identity theft - I couldn't feel safer. Nothing is fool proof, but this comes close. Love it!"
4,OK,"I had a problem where one of the screw brackets was damaged- either in shipping or it was actually a returned item being sold as new- I couldn't tell. I didn't discover the damage until I had already demolished the old box and started installing the new one. It functions OK without the one bracket and Amazon was good enough to give a price adjustment of 10% without going through the hassle of disassembling it and returning it, which was OK. The door sticks a little (bracket damage is on the other end, so that has nothing to do with this issue). Otherwise, it operates fine and for the price, it was worth the $. Better than spending hundreds of $ on those ugly square boxes."
2,"Not bad, but far from good","I liked the looks of this unit, plus it looked like it would be real easy to install on any post. But, the magnet to hold the door shut is placed in such a way that when the mail carrier tried to insert some of our weekly ad mailings (we get them two time weekly), they caught on the magnet and ripped. Larger items and the magnet closer do not like each other. I sent it back and am ordering something else. I cannot reccomend this mailbox to anyone."
1,Bad product,"1. Entire top is plastic. Easily broken into. Turns yellow after weathering.2. After a couple of years, bottom and corners are completely rusted.3. Steel door is mounted on plastic brackets. Hence easily broken into, makes no sense at all.Look elsewhere as there are much better mailboxes in same price range."
3,Old News,"I was very disappointed with the outdated Photoshop information in this book & its many illustrations using nude women. He does give some good ideas such as using a stroke to create a geometric shape. Otherwise, I would suggest buying Digital Photo Art instead, it gives much more current information about techniques & the products used."
2,Sucks! Recorded on a Back-lot Studio in California,"After watching this movie for about 30 minutes, I knew something was wrong. There were no hills or bunches of trees. It looks like the movie was made in huge somewhat empty parking lot.Too bad, cause Rory Cochrane is my home.(Know what I am sayin'?) Don't even waste your time. Try and check out ""Southlander"" instead.Peace"
3,Dogtown plot summary...,"From IMDB.com: ""Two guys. One girl. Someone loses. Philip Van Horn, who left his small town a long time ago to become a Hollywood actor and hasn't had any success at that, returns to the town for a visit. There he is uniformally met like some kind of celebrity and movie star. He uses it to impress his (and everybody's) school love Dorothy, her life now a grey boring experience."""
3,George Hickenlooper is FROM MISSOURI....,"The movie is not spectacular, but not bad either...but THE DIRECTOR IS FROM MISSOURI. This is not ""Hollywood's View of the midwest,"" rather a midwesterner's view of the midwest...By the way, Hickenlooper has apologized numerous times for not filming this in Missouri. He, as many do many viewers, feels that it hurt the film to be shot in California."
4,Beware,"I bought an earlier edition of this software and worked with it alot and was satisfied with the software itself. Unfortunately, the manual was apparently written by someone who had never used the software, and contacting the seller was totally wasted time; they refused to respond to any questions. I recently bought this new edition, hoping the problems had been solved over the past few years. No such luck. The manual is even worse than before, and the tutorial doesn't even come close to what is actually to be done on the software. If you can figure this out yourself, it is a good tool for screenwriting, otherwise, you are going to be terminally frustrated and chuck the thing into the river. Beware, expect NO help from the manual or from the manufacturer."
5,Very interesting and insightful,"This book is very interesting and insightful. It is very interesting to learn about the conditions that caused the world to have high birth rates in the first place and about the conditions that have caused birth rates to be so low in recent years. It is also good to see that there is a solution to the aging of the world's population, and to learn about the changes that need to be made in order to solve this problem. I really like books that offer solutions to major problems."
1,Same old Eugenic fears,"Longman's book portraits old Eugenic fears in modern times, and even worst, some old Eugenic ""solutions"" for the ""Depopulation problem"". Longman should read about Eugenics history and learn all the damage it caused to humankind. He can start learning by reading ""Demography and Degeneration: Eugenics and the Declining Birthrate in Twentieth-Century Britain"" by Richard A. Soloway."
4,Elida at her best!,"Released in 1996, ""Algo entero"" is truly one of Elida Reyna's best releases. Twelve songs are included; ""Lagrimas de Amor"" being my favorite. It also includes some of Elida's classics such as ""Prisionera"" and ""Quiero Volverte Loco."" This album is sure to please any tejano music fan; I highly recommend it!"
4,Nice...Pretty Varied,"The Fever's a pretty decent band, they always remind me of '80s rock, but that's just me. I like this CD because the song types vary. ""Dream Machine"" is sort of slow and creepy, ""Scorpio"" is like a slighty techno song, and ""Gray Ghost"" sounds nearly ska in a few parts. It's a very nice mix of different styles of songs. It's certainly worth buying."
3,Decent,"Many of these tracks aren't worth listening to. A few of them are more of an insult to the band: They were influenced by Iron Maiden, yet the actual sound of their regular music differs so much, it's hard to imagine them coming anywhere close.However, Opeth's version of ""Remember Tomorrow"" is outstanding. It is the shining point of the album, in my opinion."
2,Tribute? More like an insult...,"This CD is loaded with death metal bands who absolutely butcher these classics. Bruce Dickinson is probably the best singer in the genre... these guys are awful. Steel Prophet is OK but you have to check out Opera IX. It has to be the worst performance I have ever heard. Oh well, feeble attempt for money and exposure. Avoid it."
2,Not worth the money,"Well, I thought this would be a lot better than it was, because I figured its pretty hard to mess up Iron Maiden's great music. I was wrong. It was terrible. Although, the reason I dont give it only 1 star is because it was, in fact, a tribute, and Steel Prophet did pretty well."
1,"So many other movies to watch, please don't waste the time.","This was an extremely disappointing sequel to the first XXX. The left leaning undertone to the whole movie that war is bad, US government is corrupt and the people have to stand up and fight the ""MAN"" and take back the ""Power"" is over the top. It's like this was made to sell a political agenda and not a movie. So that's what you get. A terrible movie with known actors and celebrities. (Willem Dafoe, Peter Strauss, Ice Cube, Samuel L. Jackson)I could continue with reasons not to waste your time but I think you get the idea how bad this one is already."
2,...and if the muscle guy could only act.,"Duh, if dis ding could walk it would, like, go and jump into a box and, duh, ship itself, (snort) to Siberia where it could be burned to warm up sumbuddies buddy. Duh."
3,THE FIRST ONE WAS A LOT BETTER!!!!!!,"I have to say that the first Triple X with Vin was a lot better then this one!!!!!! This one was not to bad and had lots of action,but i didn't feel that Ice Cube should have been the new Triple X!!!!!!! The story is basic like the first and Ice Cube is after the secretary of Defense which is played by William Defoe which is the bad guy!!!!!! The movie had lots of action through the whole time and i would rent this one,but keep in mind that the first with Vin was a lot better!!!!!"
4,"The ""XXX"" Guys",I totally enjoyed Ice Cube in this movie. This was another side of him in playing action type movies. It was good and I watch all the time. A good action movie.
2,My cat could write a better movie than this...........,"This has to be the most stupid movie I have watched for a long, long time. I'd be here all night pointing out plot holes and the stupidity of it. If a train is going in a straight line at 150mph, is it possible for a car doing less than that through city streets and traffic to gain and catch the train? In another scene Ice Cube's left arm catches fire, then the flames are put out and the burns are on his right arm. I could go on and on but it's been said in other reviews before me. Your IQ will literally half while watching this mess. At times I didn't know what movie I was watching as the movie rips of scenes from The Fast And The Furious, GoldenEye, Under Siege, Under Siege 2, Octopussy and Mission Impossible to name but a few. I'd rather have my balls sandpapered raw for 90 minutes than have to watch the insulting stupidity that was this movie again. One star because I have to and one star because people should be rewarded for effort."
2,Peace?,"Well, at least the movie is about the need to understand that the US is not alone in the world. Or something like that. Whatever. I paid U$S 1.25 to see this, and is exaclty what is worth. The two stars are because some stunts are OK, and some false-looking CGI is still engaging, and the blonde is hot. and that's it. The racist instances against white people are only a result of the sub-culture propelled by MTV and other music channels; or maybe the expression of the way of life of a reified lumpen-proletariat. In any case, is incredible that the subject is considered mainstream. Like always, black men cannot sleep with white women, and the higher ambition is not to love and be loved but to drive a (very) fast CGI car. Ok. Next."
1,From bad to worst,"Question: What's the worst movie you have seen? We all have seen at least one, and this POS is certainly one the worst I have seen. The main character, out of shape and unable to act, seemed better suited to play a street pimp than a hero who saved the President. I borrowed this movie, and it saved me the regret of spending my money on absolute garbage."
4,xxx:State of the Union,"Excellant action and drama. Would have been better with Vin Diesal, but Ice Cube did a good job filling the role.Good descriptive info on the movie and great service. Always satisfied."
3,NOT TOO BAD,"If you like action, explosions, and typical Hollywood specialFX, this movie is for you. Alot of stuff that happened in thismovie, was rediculously unbelievable, but it's just a movie.Disconnect your brain for 90 minutes, and enjoy the ride."
1,"I UNDERSTAND 'EQUAL RIGHTS' - BUT A SHORT, FAT BLACK GUY SAVING THE USA IS JUST A JOKE","Vin is this tall, strong guy that looks like he can kick almost anyones assand Ice Cube is a short fat guy who looks like he could get his ass kicked by anyone.are we actually supposed to believe that this fat out-of-shape short guy can jump off a building & grab onto a helicopter? give me a break.At least someone like Wesley Snipes would've been believable."
2,Terrible Movie,"This was one of the most fake and stupidest movie ever.There's so much stunts in this film thats so fake it's unbelieveable.I like Ice Cube , he plays a good bad#ss and this role was for him but the stunts he had to perform are overated.This movie really stands for Hollywood.Not worth buying or renting.I ended up shutting it off about 35 minutes in.It's too bad that Willem Dafoe had to be in this movie.Ice Cube needs to stick to his Cube Vision flicks."
3,The three stars were for Willem Dafoe and Samuel L. Jackson,"I won't beleager the plot or the criticism. Watch the film for Dafoe and Jackson and you won't be disappointed.These two actors continue to astound me and for their performances alone, ""State of the Union"" is at least worth watching once. Dafoe's portrayal of a meglomaniac Secretary of Defense is one of his best bad boys. I prefer Vin Diesel as XXX, but Ice Cube did show a little more depth than he did in ""Barbershop.""They're planning on getting a different Agent X (according to the script) so Ice Cube probably will not be in the next show. If they keep Jackson as Gibbons, I think it'll be worth watching."
2,Better than expected,"Pretty entertaining with an above-average script for this kind of movie. Adequate doses of action and humor; lots of vehicular action (boats, cars, tanks, and a train); a little bit of silly sermonizing about throwing money at America's enemies until they like us; but fun nevertheless, if you can take Ice Cube's constant scowl.The movie does cheat, though; we don't see how XXX escapes a competently-organized dragnet while he's in the water, and the gunfights are totally lacking in any smarts - one side fires, the other side fires, one side dies. Whoopie.If you can ignore these problems, you'll enjoy it."
3,3 AND A HALF I THINK,I DONT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO GIVE. NOT A GOOD QUALLITY FILM. BUT I TOTALLY DUG THA ACTION AND ATTITUDE IN THIS FILM. OTHER THAN THAT THIS MOVIE IS GARBAGE.I UNDERSTAND EVERYBODYS RATING. BUT......LIKE I PRETTY MUCH ENJOYED IT A LITTLE. PLOT IS HORABLE.THIS IS THE MIAMI REVIEWER.PEACE
1,Whaaa.......,"Do massive pyrotechnics, zinging masked invaders, impossible gimmicky flying objects in situational lapses of taste and intelligence, and implausible threats to the nation make a movie? Does peppering this treacle of a script with some respectable actors (and eminently forgettable ones) make a movie? For this viewer the answer is a solid 'nope'! When oh when will Hollywood tire of this hyped disaster concept? This qualifies as a ""must miss"" movie. Grady Harp, July 05"
1,Triple CORNEY!,"Wow, was this an action movie or a comedy? This was so bad I laughed through most of it!"
3,Each story almost succeeds,"John Biguenet is a great writer. That doesn't mean that his stories are great. His writing style is very captivating and original, but that can't save a poorly orchestrated story. It's like watching Tom Hanks trying to act his way out of the Davinci Code. You know Hanks can act, but you just can't see it on the screen. I can tell from reading this collection of stories that Biguenet can write, but there's nothing extraordinary about any of these stories. Each one starts out very promisingly, and ends in a cloud of vagueness and unanswered thoughts. That would work for one story, but not for all 14.The one stand-out story that follows-through and has a real, moving, understandable ending, is 'Do Me'. The rest you're better off skipping, because the disappointment of each conclusion is greater than the last."
2,Very dark,"The author is very skilled, but the subject matter is dark, ugly and horrible. If you want to read very well written descriptions of sadism, torture and other horrors then this is the book for you. I admire the authors skill, but I am not going to finish the book. I don't want these images in my mind."
5,Rx: One story per day as needed. Savor the implications.,"Stunning. Marvelous. These short stories are the finest examples of the craft. I was stunned by ""The Vulgar Soul"", realized I was into something very special reading ""Rose"", had my heart torn out and handed to me by ""Lunch with My Daughter"", and marvelled at the incredible descriptive power of ""The Open Curtain"". There are no turkeys here, John Biguenet has become a master of this genre early, reminding me of the wit and wisdom of a much older Somerset Maugham. Please read this book!"
4,Unexpectedly good!,I went in blind for this book based on a recommendation somewhere.Excellent collection of short stories by an author I was previously unaware of.Well thought of eclectic plots revolving around human personality and condition.Highly recommended.
4,Good Book if you need to make AutoCAD more productive,Look at the utilities that are supplied with the book. The script maker is a great utility for processing specific operations to a number of drawings such as converting drawings from release 14 back to release 13 or 12. It is similar to the batch plotting utility supplied by Autodesk in release 14 except that it can process any number of AutoCAD commands not just plotting. Autodesk has implemented some of the routines in this book in release 14 but not all. Good source for customizing AutoCAD.
5,Great for learning simple words,"My son received this on his 4th birthday, and plays this game the most of all 6 Leapster cartridges. He plays them games, repeats the words, and then he took it a step farther...He has a fridge phonics, lowercase letters, and a word whammer (that didn't get used until he got this game), and he is constantly going into the kitchen to spell the words that he learned from this game and then he writes them on a dry erase board. He does the same thing in the tub with foam letters and bath crayons.It is a great game for pre-reading skills and makes learning to read basic words fun. He actually recognizes words from this game to words in all sorts of printed material.As for the durability...my son accidently put it in the kitchen sink full of water. We let the game dry out for a few days, and when we put it in the leapster it still worked...no damage to the leapster nor the game."
2,off color,I was looking forward to wearing this necklace but it came as a disappointment. It is simply cheap material and cheaply made.
5,The Best Book on Maui,"Having been to Maui a dozen times, this book is the best Maui guidebook I have ever read! The combination of this book and the related webpages makes this book outstanding! It is nice to be able to check out your accomodations via aerial photos before you book them. Plus the nice sense of humor that runs throughout the book is enjoyable, makes you realize that these two have not only a sense of adventure, but, a real sense of the time and money a tourist to Maui might have. They seem to be completely honest about accomodations, tours andrestaurants. While we might think that having tons of money to spend while on Maui is ideal, they show you how to get by and have a great time without spending a fortune. Don't think you have to do all the trips and tours that they give you in this book on your first trip, save some for the 2nd, 3rd and more trips back to Maui. I can hardly wait until they publisha book on Oahu."
2,Two stars,"The chatty opinions got a little tiresome. What I look for in a guidebook is information and this had very little compared to the two others I had along - Lonely Planet Hawaii and Fodor's. The activities were mostly geared to those thinking they can still find hidden places on the island. When I reached their ""secret"" snorkeling gems, there were forty others there and the water wasn't as clear as places right in front of our hotel. Snorkeling Mauai is a more relieable and useful book."
5,Best Guidebook I've Found,"This guidebook was terrific. The reviews are true to their word. Restaurant reviews were right on, from service to quality. I recommend this one to anyone who travels to Maui. Don't bother with the others!"
5,Best Guide I have ever used!,"A wonderful guide book. Very detailed and easy to read. The maps, photos, and directions given to each tail, beach, or adventure are excellent. You will not find a better guide to the Hawaiian islands! Look for their other books on amazon.com"
2,Over rated.,I bought this book because of its glowing reviews. Most of the information matched the contents of the free publications given away at the airport and visitor racks in front of supermarkets. It is more of an advertising piece than a real guidebook.
4,Decent Book,This is a decent book. I used this book during my honeymoon on Maui. We mainly stayed in Hana (10 days; great town) and used the book to find secret beaches. We also used the book when we stayed in West Maui (Kanapali beach for 3 days). The Hana section needs a little updating.
2,Over hyped,"The text is out of a promotional brochure, like a chamber of commerce piece or an advertisement. I read the book from cover for cover and it showed no compassion for the people of the island or their history. Very slick and colourful but the material it contained was very shallow and disparaging. I found a good map and a rental car are all you need to see Maui and form your own opinions."
5,Incomparable to other guidebooks,This is the best guidebook I have read for any vacation destination. Its a quick read but covers all of the necessary information with great detail where required. Makes the other books seem completely inadequate. Highly recommended for anyone planning a trip to Maui.
5,A must if you're going to Maui,"Finally, a guide book that gives honest opinions- good AND bad! This is a must for the Hana drive. You'll see so much that others miss. Make sure you get this well before you leave so you can take advantage of the helpful pointers on, for example, what to pack to wear on the volcano. I would have been lost in Maui without this book."
2,Cutesy and flip,"This was our first visit to Maui and we wanted to find sunshine and special places where there wouldn't be gangs of tourists. Before we left we outlined where we wanted to go using advice from this book. With the glut of reviews, way more than any other Maui guidebook, we thought it would be reliable. Maui was nothing like they described. The beaches listed were overcrowded and their vague directions left us asking locals which road to take. Needless to say, we were very displeased with our purchase."
2,Something new and better,"The new Lonely Planet book for Maui just came out and it leaves Maui Revealed in the dust. To me it has a better tone, it's more upbeat, there are more listings and you learn alot more. Maui Revealed stayed in the glove compartment the entire time. For what we look for on vacation, it just didn't spark."
4,We'll Never Know How Far His Vision.................,"We'll never know how far Mark Brickell male erotic vision would have gone. Sadly, he left us in February 1994. This second book in the series is a highly erotic and beautiful showcase of male nude photographs. This Canadian photographer had a way with displaying the male nude in a very simply but erotic vision, much like that of Robert Mapplethorpe. His models are draped in cloth, and symbolism, but presented in their stark nudity, displaying their well-endowed eroticism to the best advantage. These black and white images of young men are very bold and stunning in their sharpness & clarity.This is a wonderful second edition to this series. A must for your collection!"
4,the title speaks truth,"Reading this book truly is like taking in a big breath of air. Godden's style is so refreshing; though not a page turner, this book leaves you feeling as if you had just taken a trip to a wild island, and you are reluctant to come back to real life."
4,Very cute!!,"The shoes are super cute, but it almost borders on the childish. The shoe looks a little wider in person than it does on the computer screen and the soles are a little thin. I usually wear size 6, but I bought a size 5.5 and it fits perfectly with socks. Otherwise, I have received many compliments on my shoes and I enjoy wearing them with skirts and over jeans. Love these shoes!"
3,"Fun idea but not worth $, buy Craftsman kids tools instead","I wouldnt pay 20 for this, but I got it for 15 w/ a coupon at xmas. I thought it would be fun, since my 3 yr old likes to plug things in. It needs 8 batteries, it only comes w/ 4 for the generator, each tool needs 2 each. One power cord didnt work straight out of the box, so we can only use 1 tool at a time. The tools are kinda cheaply made, and I wished they worked on their own w/o the cords and generator, I know thats the point, to work together, but you have to keep track of where everything is. Also, the generator just makes an annoying hum. Instead buy the the tools Sears makes(Craftsman), they are a much more realistic and quality, also the Toro brand at toys r us is ok too."
2,$59.99 is a total Rip-Off!!,"I just bought this toy for $12.98 at Toys R Us---my son loves it, the wires could be a danger as previously mentioned, but my 3 yr old is very technical and plugging this in was a better alternative to extension cords!! It is a little 'cheaply' made, but he is careful with all of his tools and takes it very seriously!"
4,Alaska Statehood Story,"Edna Ferber's book, Ice Palace, is a well told story of Alaska and its long journey to statehood. This book written in 1958, was just one year before Alaska did become a state.Christine, is the granddaughter of two men who are very influential in Alaska; both who represent totally divergent points of view.One loves Alaska for its beauty, its native people, its wildlife and all it represents as America's last frontier.The other is interested only in making a profit from it, and retaining political power.Through these fictional characters, Mrs. Ferber, reveals much history of Alaska and the people who inhabit it.Though dated, it still provides the reader with an appreciation of Alaska. I understand that the book was influential in the vote outcome which allowed Alaska to become a state at long last."
3,Not Bertini's best,"This is a strangely unbalanced performance for Bertini, compared to his amazing recording of 2nd and 3rd. Part 1 is superbly played with choir and soloists taking the centre stage. Part 2 suffers from overly melodramatic singing by soloists and ill judged tempi - it slows down where it should not and speeds up where it should be slowed down. The effect is rather like listening to an opera than symphony. The music fails to take off until the very end. The only disappointing performance in his complete Mahler cycle."
5,Wonderful find,The well cared for old book was illustrated long ago by a family member whose illustration work had not been know to us. We were very pleased to find this art work in this book.
1,King Arthur and his Most Noble Knights,"King Arthur's Noble knightsSidney Lanier's re-telling of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table may appear confusing. However this story has the same original plot and theme of King Arthur weaved into the story. This book contains stories on the coming and passing of Arthur in the 6th century, King Arthur's most noble knights, and the quest for the Holly Grail.Sidney Lanier's version tells more details then other novels of King Arthur. For instance, Lanier always describes what knights do when they traveling to a destination. He tells where the knights stop and sleep for the nights and what they eat the next morning.Lastly, in my opinion this book should be read by adults who understand the meaning of words such as wrought, meseemeth, and wot. I did not enjoy reading this novel because of the complexity of the language."
3,Very very thin - like a pamphlet,"The first thing that struck me was THE TYPE SIZE IS SO HUGE. it's like the book is a special edition for people who have trouble seeing. or for a kid who's learning to read - you know like the big type in those ""See Spot Run"" books.the book is so short - you don't really have to buy it - you could easily just go to a bookstore and read it there and be done in 5 minutes. but some good tidbits of information though!"
2,"Too Short, Should Have Been Longer","I was very exited when I first heard about this biography about J.K. Rowling. I immedietily went to my local public libray to check it out.Let me tell you: this book is not worth anything. It is way too short. It only had 96 pages, and the book actually started on page 11.The print is HUGE. It took me 15 minutes to read it. Also, I was dissapointed because the biography part was very short, the rest was all garbage all Harry Potter fans know about the four books.And yes, it will spoil them for anyone who hasn't read them.Don't waste your money. Read it in a bookstore or check it out of the library, but don't bother buying it.If you want a better, more detailed biography, try J.K. Rowling: the Wizard Behind Harry Potter by Mark Shapiro."
2,Dissapointing,"This book clearly was not what I expected. Though the book is the only ""authorized"" biography of Rowling, it's a dissapointing book. For starters, the print is huge and not to mention the book starts on page 11! The biographal part was really the only part where fans wanting to learn about Rowling can find information about her. Plus, is in a question-and-answer format, so it dosn't really tell full-out about Rowling. The rest of the book basically is about the Harry Potter series, and it tells about the four books that have been released so far. (Come on hurry up book 5, I'll be waiting for you on June 21!) Anyway, the book is basically more about Harry Potter than J.K. Rowling. And, like one reviewer said, you could go to the bookstore and read it in less than 20 minutes. Don't waste your money on this one, just wait until a decent biography of Rowling comes out."
3,"This was okay, I guess......","I was kind of dissapointed with this biography, since I had wanted to read more about her life instead of the books which I have already read. I liked the interviews from O magazine, Newsweek and Larry King but felt that we didn't need to read the things about the books, since if they are looking for info about J.K. they probably already read the books. So it was okay, not the best."
4,Good for kids,This is a great little interview book about J.K. Rowling as a writer. It's great for kids looking for career inspiration and interested in learning about the process of writing.
3,Canciones de Corridos,"I was not happy with this buy because I did not expect a ""Tambora"" music background. As always Antonio Aguilar sings very well, but accompanied by Mariachi music would be more to my liking."
3,must have for wrestling fan,Great toy for all who liked Benoit. He was a great wrestler and this toy has brought lots of fun to both my sons and daughter. This is a good way to remember him for the wonderful wrestler that he was instead of what happened in the last 3 days of his days on earth. I try not to judge because we will never know what was going though his mind and what events led him to do what he did.
1,Simply Disappointing,"I got this toy soon after Chris did his thing with his family. I was stunned to find out that the toy was still available, and even more stunned that it did not come with the noose or the Xanax. Mostly I was irritated about the Xanax. I certainly think the toy should come with a lifelike noose and a bunch of steroids."
3,Edith Wharton's Orientalism,"Fans of Edith Wharton who are hoping to see her usual insightful wit will be disappointed with this book. Likewise will those hoping to learn something about the real Morocco. Instead, what this book provides is a fascinatingly nauseating example of racist, orientalist cliches: the eroticization, the emphasis on mystery, decreptitude, etc. One classic bit is the description of the souks full of ""savages"" ""consumptive Jews"" and ""lusty slave girls."" But my favorite is when a windstorm in the Djmaa el Fnaa suddenly appears, ""stripping to the waist the slave girls scudding home to the souks."" There are some peculiar twists to her vision of Morocco, but I won't go further. Buy this book if you are interested in such things. But first read Said's Orientalism, if this stuff is new to you. If you are planning to travel to Morocco, buy the Rough Guide and Culture Shock: Morocco."
4,a travel guide,"Although written a century ago, it provides great descriptions of the Moroccan geography, as well as some historical perspective (albeit biased). But what I like most about it was the reminder of the vivid descriptive writer of an earlier time. Her words are wonderfully melodic."
4,Fascinating period piece but Kindle version lacks the illustrations,"I'm not sure it's fair to judge Edith Wharton's turn-of-the-20th-century impressions of Morocco with our turn-of-the-21st-century moral and political sensibilities.That being said, I found this to be a fascinating account of the culture and geography of many places that I've personally visited in Morocco, and I found the contrast with my own contemporary impressions extremely valuable. Her accurate - if judgemental - rendition of an essentially feudal society that existed in such proximity to ""modern"" Europe barely 100 years ago is amazing. I haven't read anything else by Edith Wharton - even Ethan Frome! - but I'm motivated now to read more of her work and find out more about her apparently exceptional life.Only 4 stars here because the text would have been much enlivened by the original illustrations (contemporaneous photos) that are missing from the Kindle version. I just may buy it in print."
3,Different material than I'd imagined,"I wasn't how sure how many stars to give this. I was so excited when I found these online and quickly put them on my registry. Then I ordered them myself instead of waiting for a friend or family member to buy them for me -- I was too enthralled by them!They came today and I was SO disappointed by the material. The pictures aren't detailed enough to show it, and I'm not sure how to describe it accurately, but these are made of a material that looks like white mosquito netting! It's sort of like first aid gauze or cheesecloth... I was definitely expecting something more ""sheer"" and ""flowy"" -- not netting!I haven't decided yet whether to keep them or send them back. I wish the picture had been detailed enough to see what sort of material it was. :("
3,Kids left behind series 13-18,I recently discovered that there was no number 18 in the collection. An extra number 12 was included. Where is number 18?
2,Hummmm it's ok,"I bought 3 movies I thought were Boston Blackie so that is the number one disapointment, none of them were. Of the 3, sad to say this was the best but still it's not very good. It's suppose to have funny bits in it but it's not funny. Chester Morris is a magazine editor, and things get published without knowing what was in the magazine? Please. Then he lets his star photographer go to jail for murder, he's bragging he'll get her out he can fix it. She almost goes on trial for the murder. The whole thing is not believable, not even enough to say oh well it's ok for a bit of fluff, but remember it is be best of the 3 I bought. So there are 2 more that are worse than this. I don't recommend you buy it, but that's just me."
1,broke within 2 weeks,"It lasted two weeks. The rubber housing opened a little when squeezed near the usb plug and along its width (blue thing to blue thing). A little dirt or moisture got in. The computer no longer recognized what kind of USB device was being plugged in. I tested other USB devices, including a different flash memory, and they all worked fine.I cut the rubberized covering off and blew the circuit board clean. The computer then recognized that the device is (was) a usb flash memory. I promptly backed up my data. I'm back to my 2Gb sandisk that has lasted about 2 years."
5,attrition's most interesting,"Attrition is the type of band that gets better with every release, without getting boring. It's a real shame that they don't get the recognition they deserve. Dante's Kitchen shows how good they have gotten. A lot of the elements that attrition are known for are here: Martin's low, growling voice, Julia's fine, operatic wailing, and their use of the violin to add the the music's depth. The best song on here, in my opinion, is The Head of Gabriel. However, with 10 tracks, there are really no bad songs on here. I definitely recommend that you get this CD, or 3 Arms and a Dead Cert. They are Attrition's best works. I just wish this album was a bit longer!"
4,Good product,"Installation instructions were a little vague and the heatshield bracket is a little ""flimsy."" Other than this the product is excellent. I noticed an immediately increase in throttle response and fuel mileage."
2,must return item,i had to return this item because it requires access to power line in addition to telco line. This was not mentioned in the item description.
1,"No Battery, No Help","My phone came without a battery. When I contacted Heartland customer service, they told me I had to buy the battery from the manufacturer (GE) because it is not their policy to ship parts. In addition, the customer service person named Krystal told me that I should not be ordering products from an internet site. So, I would not order this product or anything else from Heartland."
2,paid too much for a block that talks,"Although the phone is pretty, it's unpractical. It doesn't stayed charged long and it's shape is like holding a brick to your face. The buttons can't keep up with fast dialing and it can really get on your nerves when you're putting the number in and you find out no call is going out because the phone can't catch up. I recently sent in a price I found for fifteen dollars and free shipping on this phone and they're asking ninety-nine for it at time of this review. I'd be hard pressed to pay the 15, to be truthful. I have to give it some credit, I've owned it for a year and it's still functioning, but at hour intervals at a time. Nice as a whatever phone, but not for the price. Keep looking."
5,Always need a spare.,Purchased the bulb as a replacement and it took about 2 minutes to change and works fine. Very good bulbs but hard to find.
5,Exact fit and great service,I was going to recycle the old light due to the local cost of a replacement bulb. The previous bulb worked well for over 5 years. I found an exact replacement 3M replacement bulb on Amazon from a supplier at a much lower price so I decided to keep the lamp. The bulb was an exact fit and it is Made in Japan (good Quality control) something other than China (not so good Quality control). The bulb arrived ahead of the forecasted delivery date and was well packaged. Very happy.
3,This is what black metal sounds like in outer space.,"Imagine you're stuck in a spaceship on the bottom of the ocean of some hostile alien world run by horny robots, and you're very angry, morose, solemn, alone, and fidgety all the time. This is the kind of music you would make. Assuming you'd make music. You might just take up knitting instead, for all I know. The songwriting's monotonous at times, emitting that dreaded Every Track Sounds the Same odor. Well, almost. ""Tears Have No Name"" is one of the best songs I've ever heard...and throughout the album there's some very inventive keyboard work not like anything I've heard in death/black/doom metal before. They've definitely got potential."
3,Very original band.,"I heard ""Tears Have No Name,"" and thought it was a very badass track, so I decided to buy the album. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the rest of the record. It definitely has its moments (The beginning riffs of ""Intelligence is Sexy"" comes to mind), but it just was not 100% to my liking. However, that is just because I am not really a black metal fan. I've been trying to explore more into the genre, and I enjoy some things here and there (The aforementioned THNN), but as a whole, I just can't seem to get into it.Anyway, if you are looking for something original, check this band out. it is definitely not your typical black metal band."
3,industrial *progressise* black metal....whew,"I bought this because the reviews on it here were so positive. I would have to say the first thing that came to mind was the band C(K)ovenant. It has Industrial groove, Black Metal influences, and Progressive leanings. I like it a lot, not an outstanding release though."
4,a lesson learned,"The beginning of the book started off great, the middle was kind of slow and then it got really good again at the end. Overall a good read and real good lesson learned. I think all women should read this one!!"
4,Eye Opener,"I really enjoyed reading this book because it elaborated on what the characters go through when their marriage comes to an end. I was impressed with the main character's strength, because she definitely went through an eye opening experience."
3,Down low brother,"It took me a while to read this book, however; the story line was good. Not my typical grasp me on the first page kind of book. The Hart's were married for seventeen long years before Mr. Hart told his wife Sheridan, that he's been fighting the gay spirit. I do like how VCM kept God first through out the chaos. Sheridan had to deal with her father's cancer, her husband's gay tendencies and her sixteen year old son's news on having sex and about to have Deja's(his eighteen year old girlfriend), baby. My favorite book by VCM, is still TEMPTATION."
3,Better,"This book was a little more entertaining than the last book I read by Victoria, but still still predictable and unrealistic."
3,clueless,"Once again my wife pick this book out for her self so i have no clue about the contents of the book, I think she is done reading it though....Good choice i guess!"
4,Grown Folks Business,Book arrived in condition described. Received book sooner than expected. Would buy from this seller again.
2,Not Impressed,"Although I applaud a novel that talks about the strengh a woman has to have when her husband leaves her for another man and she manages to pick up her life and move forward. I felt this novel was too preachy for my taste. There were constant refrences about about homosexuality being a sin and abomination, that turned me off quite a bit to this novel. I don't want to read a book and feel that I'm getting a sermon. It took me awhile to get through it because it was rather lackluster not much going on to keep you tuned in and wanting more. I found myself just wanting to hurry up and get through it."
2,Wanted only rubber tips,"I use mainly those tips with rubber ends. They get damaged pretty fast and I need to replace them. Unfortunately, Conair only makes the full set of replacement tips. That's a shame, because I have to discard those tips I don't use."
2,Fair,"Lyric's World is Yavin 8, which is inhabited by many dangerous creatures. It's a place where Anakin, Tahiri, and their new friend Lyric have a few adventures. However, I only gave it 2 stars because the children make less progress in their assignment than I had hoped. Although some some exciting adventures do happen (you've got to read the book to know what I mean), they don't seem to come too much closer to their goal: solving the Golden Globe."
5,if you only knew!,"I have read the book Shattered Souls and I must say it was very well put together. It was an easy reading novel that kept you on an emotional rollercoaster. There has to be a part two of this book. Indera was my favorite because she reminds me of myself to some degree. I am looking forward to hearing from her and the other characters sometime in the near future because I feel that God is going to do a new thing within these characters, and if you only knew. I anticipate part two. To God be the Glory Mr.Birch and may the work you've done speak for you."
2,A Shattered Mess!,"I'm glad I didn't start with this book by this author or I never would've gotten to ""Beneath the Bruises"" which I loved. This story centered around 4 mismatched friends who were superficial and materialistic searching for happiness in the wrong places. I didn't like the writing of this book, it was very brash and downright nasty. The characters had no class and spoke more to themselves than they did to other people. Very disappointing."
4,Great Read,"This book, although explicit and graphic at times, had a way of drawing you to each character and wanting to know more about their journies in life. The character development was believable and the writer's choice of words were vivid and refreshing. It made the book very easy to read and I was always wanting to pick up the book and get more. My day wasn't complete without reading the book and I look forward to reading the sequel and finding out what happens next with the characters."
5,Hot Hot Hot,"I recently read Shattered Souls for the second time. I found it sad, funny, and Hot Hot Hot. All I could think about is that a movie must be made based on Shattered Souls ASAP, the characters are outrageous yet real.This is adult reading at it's finest, and I recommend it to everyone.I look forward to reading more from this new young author Dywane D. Birch"
3,TOO MUCH DRAMA,"Was somewhat disappointed in this book---every page was just drama, drama and more drama. Instead of the author trying to explain why the characteres were the people they were today throughout the book he waits until the last 50 pages to explain why they were this way. I can see that this author has a way of keeping you interested but was disappointed in the way it was put together."
5,A Must-Read-Book,"A very moving book. Really played with my emotions: I laughed, I cried, feared for Indy's life from the beginning. Really felt as if I were invisible watching all the characters in flesh + blood doing their thing. Loved Chyna, Indy, Tee + Britton. They are real!I kept getting flashbacks to my own childhood. I could identify with a lot of what they went through as children since the first 25 years of my life were also very traumatic. But the love, support and guidance of real friends like Chyna, Tee, Indera and Britton have helped, and continue to help, me to keep my sunshine smile.Thanks Dwayne D. Birch.I now have a new definition for myself: I am a Shattered Soul!"
5,Great fragrance and service,This was my first fragrance purchase online. I was pleased with the exceptional value which was much lower than the local department stores and the efficiency in delivery. I would definitely order from this supplier again.
1,Do Not Buy,Terrible product. Only lasts for a couple hours. Creates bad body odor. I recommend Polo Blue deodorant instead.
4,"Crisp, clean, a hint of shaving cream","Crisp, clean scent, and a little on the stronger side. It reminds me of the scent of shaving cream, which isn't a bad thing.I worry that it slightly irritates my nose/eyes though, right after I put it on. I think my body has adapted, but new users might go through something similar."
5,Great!,I have used this product for several years. It is difficult to find in stores now.I always get positive comments from women. They want to know the nameso they can buy it for their husbands.
2,Handle keeps breaking,"I ordered this item for a gift. To my surprise, the handle on the lid was broken. I reordered the item... and guess what. The second one arrived with a broken handle. Would not recommend this ice bucket because of this."
5,Hard like a tank,It does everything for what it was designed in a simply and perfect way.Thanks the guys of Beachtek for his work.
3,readable,though the plot is complicated ... the book is enjoyable. Condon makes a complex plot of killing the president of USA. he sometimes confuses the reader.yet the book makes a good read and the climax is unexpected. ofcourse not one of the best of Condon.....
3,a farcical look at a JFK-like assassination,"'Winter Kills' is certainly one strange read. Consider it to be a black comedy on the JFK assassination. Think of it as something like Condon's 'The Manchurian Candidate' except we have a father from hell instead of a mother from hell. At times all the plot twists seem to pop up ever other page, which eventually made this to be a tiresome read. By the last page I was glad it was all over.Bottom line: at time humorous and clever, but most often tedious and ridiculous. Best avoided."
3,A stumble in H-Wood albums......,"Get the H-Wood albums! If you like them (you should) THEN I would think about picking this one up. Some artists that are featured are not up to par with today's rap game (hell today's rap game ain't up to par!). Check out The Major Leagues, his best yet! Then, maybe you might venture to his old school comin up albums. 1"
2,not impressed!,"These batteries did not last more than 30 minutes in a red dot, they should have lasted 120 hours. I will not purchase these again."
5,?,"Exellent! It works very well.I am glad I found it on Amazon. I tried many place such as Fry's, Target, and Radio Shack, I could not find it."
3,non-standard size battery for Watt RO. would skip it next time.,"Glad to have finally found this battery on Amazon after looking for it at Target and Radio Shack. First shipment was lost and vendor was good enough to replace it 2 weeks later. So after a long wait, finally got it installed in my faucet for my Watt kitchen RO unit. BUT Watt admits their indicator is merely a timekeeper and goes red in exactly 6 months to remind you to change the filter. I don't really think you need a battery to do that. And the model I have is designed where the battery sits on the sink surface and gets wet. (old one was corroded; new one is shorting out)"
1,A self-contradicting and and completely inaccurate book,"This book is filled with incorrect misleading information on ways to manipulate the human voice to achieve sounds (ie. belting) that are scientifically proven to be damaging. Many of the techniques described in this book require the physical manipulation of the vocal apparatus, a process which can lead to undue strain on the vocal folds and surrounding musculature. Though this books does occassionally contain accurate information on the process of healthy singing, there is far too much that is incorrect and poses permanent damage to the voice. The author frequently contradicts herself as she explains her process of vocal ""training."" The techniques of this book ask the reader to embark on an unhealthy and permanently damaging course of vocal study. I recommend this book only to those wishing to know how NOT to sing."
4,Le Temps des Castrats,"Don't buy this CD for the Alessandro Moreschi cut: I hear there are recent re-releases of his other early recordings that are better (IF that's possible. Was his voice deteriorated beyond use?) The Paul Esswood cut, however, is remarkable for rich tone, excellent execution, and tasteful ornamentation. The Aris Christofellis cut is remarkable for being soprano (or ""sopranist."") (...)."
4,Excelent!,"This is part 2 of their new double cd, that was recorded live from their concerts in Buenos Aires. Its very, very good. It captures the energy of the live concert and the enthusiasm of everyone at the concert, although I was a little disappointed that more songs from the Fabulosos Calavera album were not included. Other than a little letdown in the sound quality versus the studio albums, this album is still a must for cadillacs fans."
5,Gran Disco,"En este disco los cadillacs demuestran la evolución del grupo y toda la energía que imprimen a sus canciones en vivo. Este disco combina canciones de sus primeros y últimos discos. Se destaca la versión de Basta de llamarme así que contiene una mezcla de la original (Bares y fondas) con la versión de Vasos Vacíos. Otra gran canción es la fusión entre El número 2 en tu lista y Contrabando de amor, que sin duda se escucha muy bien en vivo. Les recomiendo que escuchen La versión del Sr Flavio de La Pomeña, una canción típica del folclor Argentino."
2,Silly,"By the time this ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" novel came out, the series was largely out of the hands of its inspired founder Edward Packard and in the hands of various hacks. ""Terror Island"" contains exciting enough yarns, but ridiculous ones, all about some kind of Hitler type who has taken over an island to experiment with mind control (by strapping helmets on tigers, for one thing), dabble in Dinosaur resurrection, and strike terror into the hearts of governments who send spies to stop it, among them you and also a stereotypical Soviet. Amusing enough, but not one you would care to reread."
5,DISH remote,Product works as well as the device that came with the Sat receiver. No problems have been noted after I called DISH to find out how to program it for my sat receiver.
5,"Some set-up needed, but works perfectly afterward","Some of the remote control's features/buttons worked with the TV/Dishnetwork right out of the box, others didn't work until I programmed it correctly. As I recall, I think the remote would turn the tv on/off and maybe change channels, but the volume and something else didn't work until I programmed it.I think I just had to follow the Dish network's directions in the manual on entering the TV model's code numbers into the remote. I had to try a few different ones as some of the TV models had several codes listed that you had to try out. It took about 30 minutes to figure it out, but has worked perfectly ever since.The price from Amazon was better than buying from Dish and with an extra purchase I got free shipping."
5,Works great,"Easy to program, works like a charm, good quality. Just like the one we got with our Dish equipment. Shipped on time"
3,I got another one so I could have two remotes for the same receiver,"I ordered one so I can have another clone of the remote so I can operate the receiver from another room without having to bring the remote with me into that room.I also enjoy playing practical jokes on house guests that wonder why their football game keeps changing over to cartoon network.Works great. My only complaint about this remote is the curved edges on the bottom. If you go to press buttons that are anywhere but the center and the remote is on a night stand or something like that, the whole thing does a somersault. I hate it when that happens. On second thought. I'm going to deduct 2 stars for that very reason."
4,Dish Network 20.0 Remote,"This remote does the job, however it is not up to the level of performance that the original remote that came with the Dish DVR. The responce time seems slightly delayed and I have to make more of an effort to point directly at the receiver. I have not tried the program feature so I can't comment on that. Overall the performance is adequate but I will most likely try a different model in the future."
4,Great Remote for the Money,"Got this remote for the learning mode because I have an Olevia moniter and none of the codes listed anywhere work. My old Radio Shack learning remote was both worn out and cumbersome to use although it did do a good job. First of all, the remote cost a total of $9.78 postage included so I figured it was worth a try. I downgraded the remote one star because I couldn't get the learning mode to work. I was, however, able to use the ""search"" process described in another review, to work. To program my Samsung DVD player I worked through the codes on the Dish web site and one worked. Now, instead of needing to switch between three remotes to watch Netflix I just need one. Ten bucks well spent."
5,Who will cast the first stone?,"One of the previous reviews mentions preferring ""the novel, 'The Lottery,'"" which is dazzling. Yes, it is, but it is a short story.This novel is also dazzling, and although the author keeps the reader in the dark for the first half of the book, enough clues are dropped so that by the middle to the end, the reader is riveted and incredulous. There is a building dramatic irony that holds the reader, because although the blame is clear, it is also spread around due to the actions of the parents and community leaders. This is a great book, but it must be read carefully because it is a mystery with an unreliable narrator. There is another edition with a scary cover. Personally, I prefer the book without the scary cover, because I think the scary cover gives too much away."
2,electronic voice transformer,The three settings on it are laughable. All settings sound pretty much the same. It's also impossible to get sound out of it without one's own voice being just as audible
4,Loud but fun,"I purchased 3 of these for my nephews (ages 7, 7 and 6) for Christmas. They loved them! But I have to say that they had to be told that after Christmas they were strictly outside toys. They are rather loud. They really had fun with them. They are sturdy but I wouldn't get just one for several children since they put their mouths right up on the speaker. Germs. One per child. You do not get to choose your color. That was a bit of a problem with boys. At first no one wanted the yellow one. But when they left that night all of them had them in their hands in the car. An overall good find!"
5,The Swingenest Singers and Swingenest Basie Band,"This CD is a must for lovers of a perfect swing band and a quartet of singers who knew how to make music that will stand the test of time because it was so very good to begin with. Threaded throughout you feel the love they have for one another. The arrangments are top-shelf. It makes one snap the fingers and bob the head. In a break from the upbeat, the Mills Brothers do as a good a version of Whiffenpoof Song as you may ever hear. You'll recognize every one of the songs but the added touch of these titans makes them all very much today and current. It's a neccesity for anyone's library."
2,Unimpressive but pleasant to watch,"A few short dolphin footages intersperse this scenic video of shorelines, rock pools and swimming fish. Not very panoramic or comprehensive. Definitely not the most interesting or entertaining video out there about either dolphins or the sea. Try something else."
3,Apes all and any,Just a part of the series.Get the series it is no good on it's own.Once there is a connection it all comes together makes a good collection which I enjoy every now and then but alone it really needs previous viewing of some description sorry hard to be more effective than that.Suggestion watch 'em in the series.........no sweat!!Hey Cheers
2,Not so impressive,"bought for myself and a friend who also enjoys the blues. One or two songs was catchy, but overall not worth the money."
3,Just enough to keep their name alive,A couple of good songs on this cd but that is about it. Kinda sappy for the most part but a true REO'er will find something to like.
2,Ugh,"I remember being excited when this album came out. However, once I listened to the album I was very dissappointed. The production is thin, the songs are weak,not to mention forgettable. The band sound as though they are playing on a Home shopping network TV channel. Bring back Gary and Alan!"
1,Not very useful,I bought and didn't like this much at all. I am a beginning banjo player and found it just gave exercise after exercise without any songs that were fun. I would not recommend it.
4,Stories from a Joke Thief,"Fun to read how a fella gets into the ""biz"", then to read so many really good jokes. I was able to share several with friends after only the first few pages."
4,Urban Forestry: Planning and Managing Urban Greenspaces,"It is an interesting book. Relatively easy to read. Well organized. It would be nice to have more examples. Lists are good but they need to be substantiated. I also found the appendices to be nearly useless. There are many many pages of appendices and they really do not serve any purpose. It would be better just to delete those pages and give us a cheaper price. I bet we paid a lot for those appendices. So yes the price is high. I would liked to have seen many more diagrams. The ones present are helpful. The book needs editing in some sections. Overall, I give it a 3.5."
5,Talked about nursing and practice with law,This book was very educational it talk about pitfall and traps that should be avoided when working in the nursing field. Documentation is very important and you can get in a lot of hot water for not documenting
3,"Built weakly, go for the Slimx","The Slimx is worth the extra money. This model is built weakly and the lid broke very easily. It is also rather large, and gets turns off by the slightest movement when using adapters.Great features, but only get this if you're low on cash and won't be using it in anything remotely related to harsh conditions."
5,Solid product,"very good sound and very good design.enough functions to play for a long time, at first appears a little complex to operate at full, but when you start results very easy to use.the remote control is one of the clever designed units I've ever seen, very intuitive, very easy to use, and can control all functions of the player.a must have."
5,Great Player,"Finally the MP3 Player I was always looking for:Intuitive navigation through subdirectories, all necessary information on the display (scrolling could be a little faster), super sound quality, moderate power consumption, usefull remote, very fast disc access. Overall a very usefull and handy little toy!"
5,BEST DISCMAN I HAVE EVER SEE!,"I bought this discman last month, look.. is the most coolest discman i have ever see, you can download the mp3 in the internet, write them on a CD, and then listen to them quickly and with the best quality of sound. All types of extensions, MP3, WAV, ASF, WMA.. is really cool.Also, it has this amazing lit' control that let you use it more easily.If you want to buy a Discman, buy this one, is the best you should ever find. 5 STARS TO IT!"
3,Can't play low-quality CDs,"I purchased this mp3/cd player not too long ago. I have been very impressed with all the features it is loaded with; however, I have also been disappointed with its incapability to play low-quality cds. I have a very cheap, bottom-of-the-line cd burner, but the cds it burns work well on my sony walkman. Playing a copied cd on the iRiver mp3/cd player is nearly impossible. It pauses every couple seconds. However, it plays mp3 files just fine. If you have a music converter that can convert music files into .mp3 format or if you have a high-quality cd burner, then this mp3/cd player will do the job. If I knew about these weaknesses sooner, I would not have bought this cd player and definitely would have purchased an different brand instead."
2,POS,I got this cd player a while back and i thought it was going to be great. But when i got it the remote would not work and the sound was way down when it was in. Another bad thing is the battery life. I got less than 4 hours with the backlight on and without it on i got about 8. The mp3 player is also confusing to use and the player is very fragile. The top part is almost completely off on mine. Some positives are all the options you get in the menu but it doesn't balance out in the end.
3,"Not Bad, but not good at the same time.","This is a pretty good Mp3 player, but the IRIVER CHROME X is also classified as a CD Player This is something it is not. The CD player battery life is good for 3 to 6 hours. Battery Life overall is about 12 hours. The postives about the CD player is a bright LCD screen, with various options and playing modes. When I first got this MP3 Player a year ago I was in love. I still am. But there are a lot of CD/Mp3 players on the market that will give you more bang(battery power) for your buck. But the price has gone down since I bought it and the new price is more reasonable for an out of date product. I would recommend this Mp3 player for the causal fan, not a hardcore fan(get a IPOD!)."
3,Funny,It didn't come with a power suppy. It said only to use the included power supply. Very strange. Can't say I was too happy with it.
4,My Only Complaints,"insted of saying what i like about it, ill tell you what i dont:1) i dont like the remote. its hard to use and the button placement leaves something to be desired. its hard to use without looking at it to know what button it which.2) the buttons and navigation could use some work. its hard to move through the menus, i always push the wrong button and end up having to start browsing back at the begining.thats about it. good sound, plays all the files ive thrown at it."
2,not good for a long lasting cd player,"ive had this cd player for a little less than a year and it has failed me. After about 6 months or so, the cd player wouldnt work. i would press play, and it would come up to the screen that says Iriver and then under it says ""loading...""..and it would never go on...everytime it would never go on..so it was still under the warranty so i sent it back to the company and got a new one..about 2 months later...the play button did not work anymore...put brand new batteries in everytime...never worked...the player just wouldnt go on..battery life was HORRIBLE...heavy, and bulky..does not go loud at all..alright sound quality..otherwise..look for something else"
3,Amazing Sound - but limited power,"So I haven't used this yet with MP3's (as I am still putting mine together) but I thought it would double equally well as a CD player (as it is advertised). The sounds IS amazing, the design is very cool, ergonomic (though somewhat heavy compared to your standard sized CD player). The remote is fantastic. However, the playing time on a standard CD is horrible. I commute on the subway 40 minutes each way, morning and night, and standard AA batteries (Duracell) last me 2 days. That is ridiculous. I know the playing time for MP3's is longer, but come on, 2 days, less than three hours? I'd would have bought something more expensive with better playing time if I had known I'd be spending all of my money on batteries."
1,Ugly and terrible quality,"Got this online and was shocked how ugly it actually is. I also have trouble fitting my legally purchased CDs in the player, and the buttons feel cheap and flimsy. Save yourself money and troubles ..."
5,Out of this world,"Wonderful explanations. This is the astronomy book I never had as a kid! I'm a biologist and always thought I had the good fortune of working in the most interesting field. It sounds trite, but this book has opened my eyes to a universe out there. Now I even sort of understand black holes and the implications of relativity."
3,"Allpha Lipoic Acid by Rita Elkins, M.H.",Precise and clear with well referenced scientific research (mostly with rats so far). My cold diabetic feet have returned to warm and pink since using this amazing chemical. Rita Elkins gives some of the reasons for this miracle.
5,WOW!!!,You can't go wrong with this system.I don't have anthing to compare this system to because this is my first system.I recentley bought a projector and with this system I beleive its better than being at the movies.I like the towers and being able to turn or move the speakers when ever I want.I cant say enough on how much I like the sound from this system.Even with playing music I now here certain tones and back round sounds I've never heard before.ITS GREAT!!!
1,A poor environmental fanatic's imitation of Michael Kelsey,"I feel like I'v said everything in the title. Michael Kelsey has written the Bible of canyon hiking in Utah and this guy comes along, slams Kelsey, and pretends like he invented hiking books. Whatever."
3,bad smell,"The texture is okay, but the smell is bad enough that I won't use it. (So I can't say whether it is effective or not.) There are lots of reviews that say it smells good, so I just wanted to add one person's opinion that the smell is offensive. It has a perfumey fake-smell, like chemicals. (I typically prefer sweeter smells like cocoa butter or the coconut smell of suntan lotion.)"
3,Stretch Marks cream,The tummy honey butter cream is good product for stretch marks it has a very soothing smell.
1,not that great,"I bought this for stretch marks on my thighs due to weight gain. I used pretty consistently and have seen no difference. It was recommended to me by a friend and I've been disappointed by it. I dont' know if it would work better on the tummy, but I read that it is ideal for weight gain. I won't buy it again for my thighs."
3,Smells good,"Not bad, Although I think a bit on the pricey side. Smells good and is thick just don't get alot for 25.00"
3,"If you are sensitive to strong smells, skip this product.","Bella B was my third attempt at stretch mark prevention cream. It smelled better than the other two, but was still very strong smelling and perfumey. I ended up finding Palmer's Cocoa Butter and that works and smells great."
1,Doesn't work,"It's a nice moisturizer and it smells ok but it did not work for me after using it for over two months. My stretch marks are not from pregnancy and they are over a year old but I read some reviews from people in similar situations that had positive results so I figured I would give it a try. However, it's just lotion, that's all."
3,nice product,This is a good product it is not greasy and smells good. The package was not completely full though. It was filled about three quarters of the way. Iam satisfied with the product but I am not sure the amount that was in the product was worth the price.
2,it was okay....,ive ordered this product twice. the first time i used it i didnt notice a big difference in the appearance of my stretch marks. it did leave my skin really smooth and soft so i decided to order the product again and follow the direction. the second time around i notice my stretch marks werent as dark but it really wasnt a big difference i will not be ordering this product again.
1,Did not Work...,well i got this like 2 months ago because i got some pretty noticable stretch marks in my back and i applied it everyday once or twice a day but it did not do anything for me. maybe it just works on tummys like it says. i wish i could get my money back or something.
2,Not much different after 3 weeks usage,"I bought this product because others' great review. But kinda disappointed about the result. I only notice my skin a bit smoother than before. Those stretch mark cause by weight loss still hanging around my tummy. If this product lower its price, I will consider use it as my daily moisturzer."
1,Didn't Work,"I bought this product because of all the great reviews. I used it all through out my pregnancy every day twice a day. Didn't work...I started seeing stretch marks on my sides and belly. Plus I used it on my stretch marks I had before, wanted them to fade..no luck."
2,Not sure yet,"Im on my third bottle in 6 weeks in hopes that it will work, I use it religiously and no fading thus far - I wouldn't expect any miracles"
4,"Nice cream, good smell, but costly!","I bought this cream to help with my itchy skin. It doesn't work as well as the tummy butter, but it is nice. The only thing that bugs me is the price. It is pretty darn expensive for 4 oz of product.The smell is light and not overpowering for sensitive noses."
4,To early to really tell,I started this product about two weeks ago. I use it on my old marks due to rapid weight loss. The product smells great and it seem to be working. My marks looks as if there becoming lighter. It's still to early to tell. I just purchased my second tube. The only issue I have so far is the price. I hope this helps.
4,"works well, but is a bit too small","I'm not pregnant, but I am a teenager with stretch marks all over my legs from puberty/genes.I bought this a few months ago and applied it once, sometimes twice a day for more than a month and it worked! After a few weeks of application my red stretch marks started to fade until they eventually turned closer and closer to my skin color and the marks faded.Consistency and using the cream twice a day really does help although the bottle is so small, it doesn't last very long when used very often. If it was bigger it would be wonderful, because $15 isn't all that cheap."
2,Waste of time unless you are in the chess club,"This game is completely lame, even if you like to play chess. And I do enjoy the occassional game of chess, so you're not getting a biased opinion here. The gameplay is very slow when moving chess pieces, and every offensive move that ""takes a piece"" requires a lame battle screen where the attacker kills the victim. Don't waste your money on this one, unless you have every other NES game and desperately need it to complete your collection. If you are looking for just a chess game, pick something else!"
5,"Great book! Funny and sad, like life...",I loved this book. I think he captured the hell of adolescence and weird families with an excellent combination of humor and pathos. Every sentence is finely crafted -- like the writing of Wallace Stegner.
2,Don't be fooled by the price...,"First off, I would like to state for the record that I have nothing against the hardware component of this product. It has performed flawlessly for me. However, I do not like the U3 software component of this drive! In order for the stick to work, the software emulates a CD drive and autoruns the U3 software. On older machines, this can take as long as 5 minutes to recognize and install the stick!!! Compare to a Kingston DataTraveler on the same machine that takes 2-5 secs! I'm disappointed by this very inefficient way of interfacing."
4,Best cookbook ever written,"This is the best and most versatile cookbook ever written. Unfortunately the 1955 edition (as pictured) is on acid paper which is brittle and separates from the binding. I recently ordered a 1968 edition which I hope is the same book. I wouldn't be surprised if I found out otherwise, though.I would love it if the publisher would print a new edition on something that will hold up longer."
2,The American everyday cookbook,the book came and the binding wasn't together it had to be taped to keep the pages from falling apart was unhappy about the condition of the book
4,Phantasmal Decibels,"Very solid mix CD.. much better than all the generic Trance Anthem garbage that comes out every week. These songs are on the harder side- the opener by Kaistar is twisting acid trance followed by The Light's Expand the Room, with a nice vocal (not typical femme-crooning, but rather, a male rap). There are 3 tracks by Josh Ryan, who always pleases... same with the 2 by Deepsky. Overall, it's well mixed, and the set follows a nice progression. Worth the money."
5,This is a book we've needed for a long time!,"As a public health and eye care professional, I am glad to see a book like Dr. Chous'. There is an exceptional clarity to how he explains the broad scope of eye problems which can occur with diabetes as well as some very helpful and novel ideas for patients to take control of their diabetic situation and become an equal partner with their doctor in determining their own health outcome.I highly recommend this book to any patient with diabetes, any caregiver, as well as to all professionals involved in caring for patients with diabetes. You won't find any other book which packs so much information and delivers it in a way that doctors and laypersons alike can grasp the gravity of the potentially blinding effects of diabetes on the eyes."
1,"Really, really bad!","As a writer, Hoyle is justly forgotten now and the Fifth Planet is really incredibly bad, so bad it's almost funny!"
3,WWJB,"The energy the reverend has for the cause is outstanding. I enjoyed the film, but definitely feel the previews made it seem much more exciting than it actually is."
2,Could Of Done Better,There was alot of hype before this movie came out.example wal-mart won't carry this movie.Too bad this movie wasn't worth seeing again.Like the idea for this movie but the main person rev. billy keeps getting arrested or kicked out everywhere they go.Could of done better this one is just a bore.
5,Activism can be fun and entertaining!! Reverand Billy proves it.,"This is a very funny and entertaining movie, with an important message. I plan on showing this to all my friends before they go out and get sucked up into the frenzy of the debt cycle. Watch this and give the gift of your time and your love, rather than the fraud of materialism and debt which has nothing to do with the true meaning of Christmas."
1,Problematic,"This book contains 30 female speeches written by the author, each averaging 2 minutes in length and summarized by one or two sentences, such as ""Frances recommends homocide as a means of retribution for blatant promiscuity."" While Pomerance cleary intends to create fresh, new monologues that are free for interpretation, the result is a collection of rather flat pieces, centered around unmotivated characters with no real dramatic context. The content (sex, violence, profanity, politics, crime) makes it inappropriate for youngsters, and the form is too superficial for most adult actors. From this perspective, the title seems ironically prophetic."
1,YUCK,"This book is not helpful for auditions, I ordered it thinking that they were selections from plays not written by the author, everyone knows that these type of monologue books are not useful to an actor as far as auditions, AMAZON.. can you please be more specific on these books! we need to know if they are excerpts from plays before we buy them!"
3,"Unhelpful, but interesting","As a student, I found this book to be very unhelpful. First, there are no age ranges or ethnicities given as guidelines to help you select a monologue. Secondly, since they are original peices, I wasn't able to research anything about character, relationships, etc. I found them unusable because as a student, I am unable to audition or work from unpublished scenes/plays in class. However, Pomerance's writing is interesting and poignant for those who want an original monologue:just unpractical from a student's prospective."
1,FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO WATCH PAINT DRY,This has got to be the most boring collection of monologues on the market. Bar none.
5,A great pair of mini towers,"I own a pair of these speakers and am very pleased with their performance. They are ""crystal"" clear in the higher frequencies. A subwoofer complements them well. During playback of jazz, 80's rock, and techno, I was suprised at how well the speaker held on without distortion. WHAT A GREAT PAIR OF SPEAKERS! Pick your genre of music, and grab a pair of these speakers, you wont be disappointed."
5,Simply the best...,"Walters Bay is without a doubt, simply the best iced tea I have ever tasted. Iced tea is all I drink. I personally go through about a gallon a day. I used to buy Luzianne because I found it superior to Lipton. Like the other reviewer here, I tried Walters Bay when they offered it at Costco. When Costco stopped selling it I went to Google to find it. I've been getting it from Amazon for several years now. I do hope they continue to sell it. I can't imagine having to go back to the others now that I have tasted excellence!"
4,Very Acceptable Tea,"I drink a lot of tea, upwards of 2 quarts a day, sometimes more. I'm not a fan of the Lipton or Suzie whatever teas, my favorite is Shangri-La brand regular black iced tea. I drink my tea without flavoring or sweetener of any sort, so the iced tea really has to stand on its own.Unfortunately, Shangri-La was costing me upwards of 2 bucks a day, so I thought I'd give Walters Bay a try.This is good iced tea, with the price being hard to beat. When you open the box, you can ""smell"" this kind of fresh, fragrant smell, almost like iced tea potpouri. When you make the tea, it comes out pretty strong, causing me to lighten it a bit, but other than that, its a really good tea. It has a bit of bitterness to it, which is unfortunate, compared to Shangri-La, but the price is right, equating to like 20 cents a day if I make one pitcher every day.I recommend giving it a try, see if it works for you, the price isn't bad, and the tea is above average in terms of taste."
2,Poor quality control,Got this watch as a gift for a friend. That being said I did not have time to return it. The watch arrived after a lengthy shipping time for the high shipping cost I paid. The case was scuffed and the face of the watch had two hairs in it. Had to take it to the local jeweler to get them out. I expected better!
4,Definitely a fun read,"This is the second Alison Tyler anthology I've read (the other is Naughty Stories) and I must say, this one didn't disappoint. She relies on a good solid group of writers (M. Christian, Thomas Roche, Sage Vivant, Rachel Kramer Bussel, Maxim Jakubowski and a few others) to produce consistently hot stories. Really enjoyed this one."
5,Very helpful book,Our 6 year old is struggling and the school is upset that we are hiring a reading turor! This book has been helpful to us as an introduction to the issues we are facing and has been confirming of the advise we have gotten locally.
1,Don't be fooled.,"This book is not what it purports to be. It is a thorough catalog for commercially available phonics based reading education programs. There is not actually any advice on ""parenting"". There is plenty of advice on how to be adversarial with your child's teachers and school. There is extensive use of the term ""research-based"", and this is what the authors use to support their arguments. However, their scope is extremely limited. The research they cite focuses on what works to teach kids to read words (decode the symbols) early in the school years, rather than what works to help kids truly read and comprehend complex language. There is no discussion of reading comprehension. I have no question that with their recommended approach, we could all have 6 year olds reading Dick and Jane. They don't address the ultimate goal of reading, understanding what one reads."
1,The worse shoes ever,"I used this shoes only to go shopping or the supermarket, very soft use, and only after 1 week of use, the leather broke in the seam. The shoes are almost new, with little and mild use and they opened through the seam. I highly recommend not to waste your money in these shoes."
3,good widths,These look good and are truly wide for those of us with fat feet. But there not made for too much walking. The soles are just not flexible enough.
1,wouldnt buy them again,"purchased these four months ago and wear them a couple times a week, casual wear only.The front toe of one of the shoes is coming apart showing the material underneath.very disappointed in the life of these under relatively light wear.I Need a wide width and ordered wide but my feet swim in these shoes.. im tossing them and wont buy Skechers again"
5,Stable Comfort,I love sketchers. The problem was that I fell in love with the older line when navy was the color of choice and they seemed to last forever. I recently attempted the Sparta brand and they were destroyed inside of 3 weeks of hard walking and working... it's like they just gave up. (Had to take them behind the house and put them down... Old Yeller' style.) These on the other hand are much more durable and vastly more comfortable and supporting. I was leery at my color options but in the end very happy with the grey ones that I selected. (they look much better in person than on the picture) The insides are like a pillow hugging you're feet with just enough support to keep you from falling out of them. The arch in the center of the shoe is higher and it goes along way to actually assisting the way you set your foot down step to step. Just a great product all around. Very very pleased.
1,Worst Sckechers I ever owned,I'm a long time user of Skechers shoes and this is by far the worst product they ever put out. They are hard and stiff and make a lot of noise when you walk. Like they are made out of cheap plastic instead of rubber.
1,The color is different,"I bought this shoes in brown, the color of the received shoes is an unpleasant very dark brown. As a whole the shoes are looking ugly and much more different than the image. I am a very long time devoted customer of Amazon, this will be my first and last time when I buy shoes from Amazon."
5,I love it!,"These shoes fit perfectly(14EEE)right out of the box. They look and feel great. If anyone asks me, I'll definetly recommend them to buy a pair of these. I'll buy another pair when these wear out."
4,New and Improved.,"Those with the earlier version of this book only have the first half of the new edition. The new material is more useful than the older.This book is about preparing your mind for evangelism rather than following a ""cookie-cutter"" approach to evangelism. This is mostly the focus of the new material."
5,You'll be motivated to share the gospel...,"The information in this book is priceless to someone who is seeking an extra boost in their hunger to seek and save the lost. You will find how-to information mixed in with inspirational stories. This is a great book for groups to study, disscuss and apply together. It's been around for awhile, but most GOOD books have."
3,Good resource,Good readable book for those looking to begin an evangelism ministry. there are a lot of books out there and this is one that does the job.
3,Out of the Saltshaker & into the World,"Well written, interesting and educational book. She certainlyholds your interest while making it a learning experience. Hownot to be shy about being a Christian and sharing the Word."
5,Qué obra tan hermosa,"..que nos deja ver lo que EL AMOR púede imaginar: El amor a los demás. Nos ofrece una concepción mágica de la forma en que Dios creó criaturas tan diferentes como el médico y el plomero, el taxista y el Gobernante, el ama de casa y la mujer ejecutiva... Es un libro delicioso que nadie debería perderse !"
5,For lovers of GREASE,"This book is great for all Grease lovers. It's interesting to see the variations between this book and the movie but you can see how it all works in..,. Sometimes it's just a matter of a different character saying things that were said by someone else in the movie. The lines are classic, especially between the T-Birds no matter which one said it! I was happy with the quality and packaging..,. It was exactly as described and I wasn't disappointed"
5,Wonderful.,"Not much too add to the previous reviews. I discovered Buffy Sainte-Marie in college (Oral Roberts University, would you believe?). I still have the albums I borrowed from another guy in the dorm who quit school before I could return them. She spoke to my soul then and still does.One thing I noticed, she isn't one of those who has to get plastic surgery or pretend she's younger than she is. I admire that."
5,Buffy is AWSOME in person,Buffy is even better in person (or video performance) than on her sound recordings. She is an awsome song writer of all types of genres.
5,A wonderful story!,"This is an excellent book. When the father of the family gets sick and must go into the hospital, the family becomes poorer and poorer. Slowly the family comes closer to faith in God. This book helps you understand some of the trials people go through when they don't know God."
5,They Don't make music like this anymore,"Mac Wiseman has recorded hundreds of songs of all genres. This CD is one of the best. A nice mix of very,very, good songs - worth every penny. I would not part with this CD, so buy your own. Best is I have two other Wiseman CD,s and instead of being on the cell phone or listening to commercials, politics, fm garbage I slip one cd in and beautiful pleasant music for hours and hours. Makes for easy drivng.!"
3,Not the Same!,"I had the original one on dvd and lent it out to a forman at work. I got laid off and he never gave it back. I ordered this one from Amazon and it is pretty much the same but, the part with the Dems grilling Condalisa Rice was cut down. Fortunately, I was able to get the original version again used from my local library used book store! The cover on the original is different also! It is a picture of the White House instead of Michael Moore. Anyone who distrust repukes as much as we the people, who elected President Obama into office, should purchase this! If you are not a bush hater, I guarantee after watching this you will be. I highly recommend it. God bless America and the Democratic Party!"
5,Upsetting to know the truth!,"This movie is so great! I was appalled at some of the facts, but glad to hear a different side to the story. It is well worth the view even though it is not for the weak of spirit!"
4,Best Few Bucks I've Spent in a Long Time,"I was fortunate enough to stumble upon Sam's House when they played in my neck of the woods. It was their live show that ultimately made it a no-brainer to pick up their two studio releases. In fact, their CDs have received more play in my system than anything that's been commercially produced by pop culture in the last several years. The only downfall was that I actually thought I could play guitar - that is, until I saw Alan Scott molest tap arpeggios and Steve Sidley reduce Flea [RHCP] to a mere gnat! This band is a must see, but beware guitar wanna-bes - you'll wish you took up triangle instead!A True Fan,BRAD"
5,Great Biochemistry book,"This ME volume shares excellent chapters of all kinds of biochemical approaches for protein purification, expression and detection."
1,I have strong doubts that this is a james last album,It says artist Jacky Cheung.The description of the tracks are James Last.So which one of the two belongs this album?
5,Spot On,"My mother was failing with dementia when I was given this booklet by the hospice. This booklet described almost step by step the changes that had been happening to her, and helped me understand why some of these things were happening. I told my sister ""you have GOT to read this"", and when she finally did she totally understood why I wanted her to read it. It is an amazing little booklet."
5,A must read for anyone who might be losing a loved one!,"This book was given to me and my family during my grandmother's passing. It was so comforting to know that everything that happened was a part of the dying process. Now faced with losing my other grandmother a month later, I am comforted once again by the words in this book."
3,Underwhelming,"As my family faces a difficult time ahead of us I have been trying to learn about what is to come and this book was well recommended here. It is very good as far as it goes, but do understand that this is a 15 page booklet with large type. It was written (1986) pre-Internet when this sort of information was not easily come by. But these days a lot of what is here can be had from a single web page for those who like to dig in that way. For someone who does not like researching on the internet this booklet can be a blessing and its small size makes it a quick read which is good if you are hurting."
5,Agree completely,"We used this book as well in the passing of my Dad this past June. The Hospice staff at his Hospice care center gave us the book and we were able to follow along with his symptoms. And when the nusring staff came to us to tell us we were in the final 24 hours, it was difficult to believe, but the book clearly defined what Dad was going thru... and we followed the booked step by step - it spoke of the rallying before the decline... the last weeks, days, hours, minutes, even seconds - what to look for, watch for etc. I recommend this book to ANYONE who love someone who is facing a terminal illness. And the descriptive poem also called ""Gone From My Sight"" is included and expresses beautifully the act of dying - it truly is a handbook that you will keep with you throughout until your love done ""enters a new city""..."
1,map book of nortern virginia,"This was purchased thru ""Indoo"" and was five (5) issues behind the current issue. Indoo would not make any adjustment to give me a current issue. However ""Amazon.com"" reimbursed me for the entire cost. I would not recommend purchasing anything from ""Indoo"", however I would wholeheartedly recommend Amazon. com for any and all purchases."
4,Author's comment,"I wrote this paper in the course of my MA (1994) at Cornell University. It was never published. As far as I know, only about a half-dozen copies are out there.I gave it 4 stars because it could be more detailed, still; it was my original thesis idea that was replaced by the topic of what has become a book (nearing completion) on the history and identification of printed dress fabrics to 1860, which incorporates some of the information in the ""Loom"" paper."
1,Phone poor but company great to deal with,"At first this phone seemed like a great idea, and I even chose to go with one that was a little more pricey so I thought I could be guaranteed quality. Unfortunately this didn't happen. During Skype out calls, the phone was constantly cutting in and out, echoing and dropping the calls. After three attempts at using it (instead of my inbuilt laptop microphone and speakers), I gave up and returned it to the company. Thankfully the company were great to deal with and gave me a full refund. I would not generalise this to the use of the phone for calling skype users as I only tried to use it on skype out."
4,Love it!,"A Brand New Heavies collection from the 90s, includes a good variety of styles, wraps up with a blazing version of Midnight at the Oasis. Buy It before your next high energy bash!"
2,"Poor quality, but it looks good.","I thought Josef Seibel made good shoes? The soles on these shoes have quickly worn through from the inside! The leather looked frayed and the soles wore through within a few months. It's a casual style, and I loved the looks so much that I kept them, but I do object to something so shoddy even being sold!Very disappointing!"
3,Tarot Transformation,"It's the same book word for word, as ""Tarot for Your Self."" By Mary K. Greer, so if you've already purchased that one don't waste your money getting this one as well."
5,Longtime Favorite,I've purchased this book over a half dozen times and given them away to family and friends. I've read it that many times or more. Capstick has a very entertaining way of telling the story and you feel as if you're right there when it happens. Highly recommended.
5,Very Interesting,"This is my first Chapstick book, and I can honestly say that I am thoroughly impressed. He gives you a no nonsense look at the African bush, and what it takes to live or die. Interesting from the first to last page, and quick humor to help you understand the problems that could be faced"
5,Peter Hathaway Capstick is one of my favorite authors.,"I have read ""Death in the Long Grass"" and other Peter Hathaway books. All of his books were simply a delight to read containing adventure,action,terror and insights into the behavior of wild animals and sometimes humans."
2,"HOW THE ""BIG 5"" EAT PEOPLE","If you want to know the way the ""Big 5"" i.e. lions, elephants, leapards, rhino's and buffalo eat and gore people this is the book for you. Much macho big hunter tales. Although Capstick's writng style is amusing at times, it soon becomes a boring repetition of one bloody tale after another."
5,A Book for all Hunter's to read!,"It's a dream of mine to one day hunt in Africa... until that time comes Mr. Capstick's book, Death in the Long Grass has a place by my nightstand. I have read this book several times and it is one of the greatest books on the subject of Safari. A MUST for anyone interested in African Safari or hunting big-game in general.Capstick wrote this book as if it were a novel of fiction... as it would seem, but alas! This is no book of fiction! All true accounts of the African Bush and it's potentially dangerous wild-life. This book is sure to be read by me for quite a long time to come!"
5,a classic of adventure,"This should be a cherished treasure for anyone who enjoys adventure, the outdoors, hunting or extreme travel. My only suggestion would be to read the chapter on buffalo first, it almost seems to me that he had completely found his voice by that chapter.I am not a hunter, nor do I even own a gun, and I would like to believe that even the most hardened PETA person could enjoy this book (though I bet they would never admit it)Capstick was the non-fiction version of Fraser's Flashman!"
4,"Everything I hoped the book would be. I liked it very much, and hope my sons love it when they come of age.","I would have loved this book when I was in jr. high or high school, having been addicted to all books involving animal adventures, exploration, frontiersmen, etc.---whether fiction or real-life accounts. And I really enjoyed it at middle age...reading each chapter devoted to a different deadly animal. Nothing beats first-hand accounts of how lions rend a man, or buffalo stomp natives into a dusty-red smear, or as he described the damage caused by wild dogs, ""tearing-off red flags"" of meat. Whether it's 100% true, or somewhat exagerrated, I don't care---it was fun to read, and a relief from the usual, cerebral, stuffy, non-fiction stuff I read."
5,If you like Jim Corbett,Riveting and thought-provoking.I am a big fan of Jim Corbett and this is a wonderful book if you want a slightly different experience. Jim was poised and forever humble and Capstick is a bit more impetuous and brazen. Many of Capstick's experiences are spine-tingling and this book won't disappoint you there. But there is also the thought-provoking side too. Does one cull the herd of elephants or tell the farmers to move their land 1000 miles that-a-way?
5,One of the most riveting books that I've ever read.,This book has a way of drawing its reader into places many could only dream of going. Capstick pulls the reader right into the action. A book that can be read over again!
5,Can't put it down!,"I just finished reading the first chapter of this book, and I am completely absorbed! I am not a hunter, but the excitement of these hunts and near death experiences is very palpable. I find myself holding my breath while reading. It is almost a macabre pleasure in reading these stories. I have been reading excerpts aloud to my husband. I appreciate the author's wry sense of humor, and his sense of realism. I have recommended it to everyone."
5,A great book by a great hunter.,"This book is wonderful. Peter Hathaway Capstick had a real knack for putting the reader right there in the tall grass, feeling the heat and the fear of an African hunt. His description of a charging lion put the fear of God in me, that's for sure. Also, his writing style is full of self-depreciating humor and honesty. He had a real way with words and his books are all classics in the field. If you have ever wanted to go on a safari, read this book. It is refreshing to read his descriptions of hunting with no apologies. Consider the way he expresses his love of dangerous game hunting: ""That is man against himself, the last and purest of the challenges that made us men, not animals."" Either that rings true or it doesn't."
3,Animal Behavior,"I returned from Namibia, Botswana & Zimbabwe in September where we went on 19 game drives seeing a large number of animals in their natural habitat. We were able to get close to many of the animals in the Land Rover and get great pictures. However, Death in the Long Grass paints a different picture of the animals we saw detailing how dangerous each of the animals are and how careful one needs to be. It is a wonderful book about the behavior of the animals and the reasons they are dangerous. I would not have slept as soundly at night as I did had I known the dangers of some of the animals.It is a book that is gory at times but anyone who will have exposure to any of these animals should know of the dangers Capstick talks about."
2,Book doesn't capture the essence of Africa,"If you are interested in poorly written campfire stories about rampaging animals -- enjoy.Took on Safari, wanted a book to capture the essence of the wild life. Having hunted with friends I thought that a book about hunting would give insight to the big game, how to track, their habits etc.The book is one gory hunting tale after another.Not going to give you a vision of what these mighty creatures are really like up close. I saw plenty of big game, and nothing got shot or rampaged killing people left and right"
4,great songs,Don't pick up this album for the two catchy singles. There is a great rhythm to the rest of the songs. It tells a story moving from the glory ideal days to the bad times. I'm a big Everclear fan so I'm definitely biased but I found this album offered a lot more substance than just the two catchy songs.
4,"Great CD, but after a while...","This CD is great, but after listening to the CD for a while, it just didn't sound as good. At first, when I bought this CD I couldn't listen to it fully and only played some songs I loved such as AM Radio, Otis Redding, and Thrift store chair. Recently, I picked up the CD and Listened to the whole thing about 13 times. Soon after, I started to listen to the radio again. Now, any time I play it I only want to hear Otis Redding. I think Songs From an American Movie: Volume 2 isn't as good (as in lyrics, and the constant use of the ""F-word"" on the track ""All 'Fudged' Up"") as the first volume, but I listen to it anyway.Overall, this is a great CD, but don't listen to it that much. And also, If you liked the sound of previous Everclear albums (As in the more rock sound) you should get Songs From An American Movie Volume 2."
5,I play this every day.,"I have been on a massive everclear kick lately. I enjoy everclear immensely. this is one of the few albums I own that I can play and it will make me instantly happy.this album has a different tone to it. the first three are a bit more angsty... but vol. 1 takes you some place different. everclear does a great blancing act between what you might sometimes consider pop, and darker alternative rock. I like that about them. they never sacrafice their standards to make a product and they never come off depressing. just the right blend to make them great. they have a sound and a quality to them that isn't like anyone else's."
4,Not in the same league as So Much for the Afterglow,"I just bought this album, and have listened to it a couple of times through. It's good. Better than most of what's out there, but it's not up to the standards of So Much for the Afterglow, which to be fair, has been my favorite album since it's release."
4,Excellent,"I just had my first listen of Everclear's latest; it was definitely worth the wait. It seems Everclear has aged - the hard-edged Everclear sound is notably missing on this CD, but it is replaced by a richer, improved sound. The band employs a wide range of sounds, including mandolin, and ukelele. When blended with great melodies and complex harmonies, the sound is tough to beat. The lyrics are very personal, and can be at once simple and devastatingly honest. Added to the mix is a dynamite cover of ""Brown-Eyed Girl,"" and an attempt to make this a CD to be listened to completely, instead of just a collection of songs. Truly a great effort; a must have."
3,A second rate album from a first rate band,"Everclear has grown musically and diversified there style. The album is a solid effort and makes great easy listening. unfortunitly the angst and guitar driven indie rock sound that propelled Everclear to stardom on the heals of the grunge Ìmplosion, is gone. This is a obvious attempt to win over the adult top 40 audience. I know Vol. Two is supposed to be the hard album, but I miss the dirty guitar of World of Noise and the other albums. Another great band goes soft."
3,Alright But Ive Heard Better,There new CD is good has some pop tunes and some go back to the old everclear all in all it's not that bad but it's not that good
4,pretty good,pretty good cd so far-diff than sparkle and fad and afterglow-but still good nonetheless-wonderful is a great song also
3,Good but the schtick is getting old,"I love Everclear. ""Sparkle and Fade"" and ""So Much For The Afterglow"" have almost been worn out by me. But after a few listens, this one's just not quite in their league. I feel like they're starting to run in place, treading the same ground. There's nothing particularly INNOVATIVE about this album - I'm getting tired of Art's ""nananas"" and ""heys"" and ""ooos,"" and his desire to sound like the Beach Boys. ""Here We Go Again"" is just putrid, full of samples and horns and a mess of sound, that doesn't work with Art's scratchy voice. There are some excellent songs on this one - ""Brown Eyed Girl"" works surprisingly well, and ""Wonderful"" and ""Unemployed Boyfriend"" are prime Everclear. Just a few too many ""average"" songs that remind me a little too much of their past work and doesn't really raise the bar for the band."
2,Not as good as I thought,"I bought this album with hopes of it being as good as ""So much for the afterglow""and i was let down. Most of the songs don't even sound like the everclear i was used to. I found it dissapointing. There are only two songs on the whole cd that I actually enjoyed ""wonderful"" and ""unemployed boyfriend"". The rest was just somewhat boring."
4,good stuff,"i love it, but ive been a fan since 93 and from what reviewers say...not so hot. id recommend so much for the after glow first for anyone who hasnt heard them before. this one is good though. different. buy. listen. decide."
3,American Pie,Its an exemplary piece of music and gives superb examples of a typical American life. No one has a voice as wonderful as this and has the gift 2 portray a life.
3,SFAAmerican Movie,"This is not the best of Everclear. It's not nearly as good as their previous album ""So Much For The Afterglow"", but it still has some good music. I think a lot of this album is a lot softer than their earlier music, and reflects more on the past.Some of the songs have the sound and attitude of their older music but a different approach and energy level. The lyrics are fun and uplifting, and though a lot of the music sounds the same throughout the album, it works with the beat and the lyrics to make some really polished, well recorded songs. If you liked ""Wonderfull"" and ""AM Radio"" you'll probably like the rest of the album. The best songs are probably ""Brown Eyed Girl"", ""Learning to Smile"", and ""Now That It's Over"". Not the best album but worth a shot."
2,You mean I used to Like this Band?,"After hearing the disgrace to modern music that is ""The Honeymoon Song"" it's hard to believe that I ever considered myself an Everclear Fan. The insightful lyrics of their past songs (such as ""California King"") have been replaced by an endless stream of meaningless dribble, and if it weren't for ""Learning how to smile"" This CD wouldn't even have deserved one star. I just prey that Everclear's next CD lives up to their past work."
1,Horrible stuff from a great band,"I'm sorry to do this to Everclear - but this album is not what I expected and I am very disappointed by it. Where are the heavy guitars?! I guess if you like mellow stuff and pop, you might like this album. And it is not that I am a headbanger or anything, but compared to their last two ablums (Sparkle and Fade, So Much For The Afterglow) it is bad. I am still really into the last two albums, and I couldn't wait for this new one, so I am very disappointed. Some people will like this album, but if you like hard rock like I do, you won't."
2,What is the deal?,"I am sorry. I am a major everclear fan,for a reason:because I liked the way they sounded. With this album, everclear shows how different they can sound. Yeah I want them to sound diverse but I don't want that to include pop. They should stick to what they are good at:rock music. I am glad I listened to the whole album a couple times over before I bought it. At first you want to like it because it is everclear, then you listen some more and realize that they turned pop. I hope that this is just some faze because I really want the old everclear back! The next album should be better.........."
4,decent,I bought the CD because for the song Wonderful and I love the new album they put together it is completly different to there other albums but the songs are very good and every Everclear fan who has not bought it I urge you to.
3,Not Everclear's Best,"I was so excited of the thought of another Everlcear album but when I got it, it was totally different. I don't know if that's bad or good. To tell you the truth, I'm kind of mixed about ""Learning how to smile"". The songs are not as catchy as they were in ""Afterglow"" and they lack Art's genius touch for the most part. I love Everclear's music from ""World of Noise to ""Sparke and fade"" but this is really not their best work. I will although be listening to this allot more now because that's what it needs. More listening and then maybe I'll get used to it.Overall, Everclear's ""Learning how to smile"" is somewhat a dissapointment."
2,"1 part everclear, 3 parts water","I never enjoy knocking a band that I've enjoyed in the past, however if you are, like me, a fan of Everclear's older (and frankly better) material then you may be somewhat dissapointed by this excursion into pop territory. Where 'So Much For The Afterglow' was a paler retread of the excellent 'Sparkle And Fade', 'Songs From An American Movie..' is an even more dilute version of the bands former selves. While newer fans may point to Everclear evolving with the times, much of this album sounds as though they have lost their musical direction and turned into a messy retro-pop band hitting an early midlife crisis. Everclear used to have a knack for writing inspiring songs about being uninspired, whilst also celebrating life's little victories, and more importantly they knew how to rock. Now it's all 70's references, 'the good old days' and meandering songs with no real spirit, the album improves toward the end a bit but it's too little too late. Borrow from a friend."
2,Not what I expected,"I have to say that I was completely disappointed in this CD. Disappointed the same way that I was disappointed with R.E.M.'s ""Out of Time"" CD back in 1991. It was so far away from what R.E.M. was doing as relatively unknown college band. With ""Songs from an American Movie,"" Everclear just stepped into that same scenario. It is far too pop-ish for my taste. After listening to it just once, it reeked of over-production, synthesizers and sappy lyrics. I love ""So Much for the Afterglow."" It is by far my favorite CDs of ALL of my CDs. I am always listening to it. This one, will not be a favorite any time soon. I am very disappointed."
2,Everything Sparkle and Fades,"I have been an Everclear fan for over 3 years now. Sparkle and Fade and World of Noise are 2 of the best CDs ever produced in the 90's. So Much For the Afterglow wasn't the best, but it had those select tracks that rocked. When I got this CD the frown painted on the CD portrayed the way I felt. Art Alexakis found that whining about his childhood in ""Father of Mine"" sold records, so he did the exact same thing with ""Wonderful"". Art is nearly 40, although his lyrics remind me of a 17 year old. It makes you wonder how you can go from singing of rape, AIDS and abortion to ""waaaaah songs on the radio make me cry when daddy yells at me"" I'm sorry Art but I'll need to put another CD in my player in order to learn how to smile."
5,everCLEARLY AMAZING!,"This has got to be one of the best c.ds I have purchased in a long time! Each song on the album is amazing inn different ways. A.M Radio has to be one of the best songs to play real loud in awhile. Don't forget to check out Annabella's Song, which is gaurenteed to make you teary-eyed!"
5,Best Everclear album since Sparkle & Fade,"This album is clearly a step forward in Everclear's style. While I loved Sparkle and Fade, I thought that their next effort was somewhat disappointing. However, this is anything but disappointing with beautiful relevant lyrics and good musicality. While it is certainly more mellow than Everclear's past records, it lacks none of the value of a good rock album. Ranging from deeply personal lyrics to a rousing cover of Van Morrison's 'Brown-Eyed Girl' this album is top notch!"
5,Wonderful Everclear!,"This latest album from Everclear is yet another great effort from a Rock band that is just plain FUN! You can hear it in Art's voice- this is a bunch of guys that click, and know just how to keep us fans happy. Just LOVE AM Radio! Brown Eyed Girl and Wonderful are also grand. Dont miss this one!"
2,Not That Wonderful!,"I'm still kinda freaked out that this is a Everclear Album!I mean they sound so popish on this album that it makes me not want more of this album!The only 2 songs that caught me here and were okay were Am Radio & Wonderful but that was all!And the cover song Brown Eyed Girl was better left alone since i really enjoy the original.But i had to pick the best Everclear album to date,it would be So Much For The Afterglow.Followed by then Sparkle and Fade,World Of Noise,Songs From An American Movie Part:2 and lastly part:1 But i would recommend this to any soft rock or pop fan since this is not hard at all.So i'm hoping Everclear will get back to what they do best and that is Rock..."
3,Two tremendous singles...then...simply average.,"OK, ""AM Radio"" and ""Wonderful"" are absolutely killer singles.They are both catchy as hell, with crisp melodies (or what passes for melodies with Everclear...we're not talking range here) and funny/incisive lyrics.They sound glorious either in your headphones or on your car radio...or if you're old school, actual speakers too.""AM Radio"" is a bouncy recall of the simple joys of the 70's, while ""Wonderful"" is a painful but liberating look at divorce from a child's point of view.Of the two, the latter is the most impressive.However, everything else on the album is forgettable. The cover of ""Brown Eyed Girl"" was NOT a good idea...They created two great songs for their awesome greatest hits collection here, but that's it.Sorry guys."
2,arg!?,"i dont know. i bought this cd expecting it to be as good as the first one i bought. but i was dissapointed. the songs on it arent what i expected from the band. i also bought sparkle and fade, but so much for the afterglow is my favorite cd.so maybe i just didnt know what to expect from the band...but i really didnt like this cd that much. if you dont have so much for the afterglow, get it."
1,Everclear fans this is not for you........,"Ok I am one of the biggest Everclear fans in the world especially when I picked up the amazing So Much for the Afterglow....If I was on a desert island and I could only pick three cds this would be one of them. Thus I was there the morning of the release of this ""album"" and I was sorely disappointed. Everclear is known for there ""pop"" rock music yet amazingly sarcastic lyrics. This is what hooked me about the band. The lyrics were deep and insightful. This album has no depth and I really couldn't identify at all with the lyrics. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS BAND? Anyway I encourage Everclear as a great band but this album....Terrible."
3,"A little Disappointing, but not bad........","I first got into Everclear when I heard Santa Monica for the first time and instantly fell in love. Although I'm not into too dramatic, junkie styled albums (Sparkle and Fade) I loved every single track on So Much For The Afterglow and was looking forward to the follow-up on that. Grant it - I didn't feel they could possibly top their last album, but I like there unique style so I bought Vol. One.Although there are some good ""radio"" songs on this album it isn't close to being classic Everclear. Although the songwriting is amazing, it seems that something is missing with the ""edgier"" guitar riffs and what-not.INDEED, this is a good summertime, feel-good CD for cruisin' around town in, but its not as diverse as past albums and unless you are a big fan, I'd save your money. And I would also have to agree with other comments that the reviewers that loved it are ""older"" than most fans."
4,Worth ALMOST every penny,"So Much for the Afterglow is a classic among alt-rock albums. If you agree with that statement, you'll agree with the next as well. American Movie vol. 1 is a classic among alt-rock albums. This disc almost has it all. the band did mis on a few cuts and that hurt it's score, but otherwise, this is a good alt. album. Strong cuts include ""Learning how to smile"" an excellent song that stays with you for a few minutes after. ""Wonderful"" is the first single and is excellent. ""Here we Go Again"" is bound to be big. and (with no disrespect to Van Morrison) the ""Brown-Eyed Girl"" cover is one of the best all-around covers i've ever hear. If you liked Everclears middle stuff, this album should suffice for you. Nice job, Art and the boys. Enjoy"
2,Not a big fan of this one,"If you listen to this one a few times, you'll find some songs you like. Personally, I like ""Now That It's Over"", ""the Honeymoon song"" and ""Wonderful"". But most of this album is kind of corny and hokie. And the lyrics, frankly, don't have the honesty that makes Everclear great. Whereas previous albums fed off Art's cynicism, angst and pain, this one often seems emotionally vapid. I get the impression that he has to manufacture some of the emotions that once came naturally to him, which is a real problem. I still love the rest of this band's albums and will probably take the risk of buying Volume II."
5,Repays repeated listening,"Okay, I confess, I wrote a lukewarm review for this CD shortly after I purchased it, but after giving it a fair number of listens to sink into my brain, it's become another big favorite. I was too tuned into their last album, So Much for the Afterglow, when I first bought this one, and it took a while to shift gears. This is a different sounding album, but another great one. Strongest cuts are Here We Go Again, AM Radio, Learning How to Smile and Wonderful. In particular, Wonderful, which is about how a kid feels watching his parents fight and heading for divorce, picks up the themes of painful childhood developed in Father of Mine, Sunflowers, and Why I Don't Believe in God on the last album. Everclear should be required listening for parents.On the downside, no one should cover Brown Eyed Girl. Everclear adds nothing to Van Morrison's classic. I still can't get behind Annabella.But all in all, this is another great album from Everclear."
3,"Um, alright...we'll let this one slide...","Everclear has always and will always be known as the best alternative band in the world, but this latest offering was nothing short of a dissapointment. There are a few high points, but the low points outweigh them. The upside of this terrible story is that Everclear is releasing a rock album (VOL. 2, Good Time for a Bad Attitude) in less than a month which you can reserve here at amazon and will probably sound like Sparkle and Fade which we, the fans of Everclear, have been craving since the historic 1995 release. Stay tuned..."
3,"ok cd, not great","i have all four everclear cds. so you might say that i am a big fan. also, so far all the cds are improved on each other. afterglow is just amazing, so i expected this would be great, too. well, i was dissapointed. the cd is ok; but too boring to listen through all the way. some singles are good; they include wonderful, am radio, annabella's song, and unemployed boyfriend. overall, it's ok, not great, not as good as expected."
2,What the learning how to smile happened?,"I am an Everclear fan to the bone, but I'm more into Sparkle and Fade and So Much for the Afterglow. I anticipated the release of this CD so much but I have to admit I was disappointed. I'm used to a more angry everclear. I suspect that the people who wrote positive reviews are pretty old and haven't heard Everclear's old stuff. But I still respect Everclear for their past Albums and I will always consider myself a fan."
1,Everclear finally sold out! :(,"Anybody who knows me knows that Everclear is my ultimate favorite band. I've been with them from Fire Maple song to Strawberry to Amphetamine. Unfortunetly I don't support them on this CD. I don't have a ""chemical smile"" either. They not only lost there ""sparkle"", but worst of all they ran out of ideas. To a true Everclear fan this stuff is like drinking water after you were expecting wine (and belive me only Jesus could change this CD!). Basically this is not the best CD for true everclear fans. I recommend you try it for yourself though. Then try the real thing with either ""World of Noise"" or "" Sparkle And Fade"" ( Everclear began to sell out with ""Afterglow""). Everclear USED to be a great band, and I USED to be a great fan. They took away the spark inside. :( P.S.: I'm older than one, but they must think I was born yesterday to give this more than one star!Joan of Arc 2000"
4,(...),"great album!!! everclear's second best, after vol.2, which is THE BEST! the no. 6 & no. 12 aren't that good, but the rest is pure everclear! buy it, it's all worth it!"
5,review,"This album is great. The minute I heard the song""Wonderful"" I new this album was for me. My 2 favorite songs are ""Wonderful"" and AM radio""."
4,Unexspected,"I am an Everclear fan so I had to get this album, even if ""Wonderful"" sounded like a rewritten ""everything to everyone"", but I have not been let down by the band. The album feels a lot more diverse than the previous three and even though it does not stand up to the power of the first two albums. ""learning how to smile"" and ""honeymoon song"" have become my daily dose of Everclear."
3,Not the best release from Everclear,"I have listened to this all the way through a number of times and I have mixed feelings about it. At first I was very disappointed. Everclear is one of my favorite bands, and my expectations were high.This album is quite a departure from Everclear's other releases; it is very pop oriented (alternative pop?). The first single, Wonderful, is by far my favorite track. Other decent songs include; Now That's Over, Unemployed Boyfriend, and Learning How To Smile (but they are not in the league of Heroin Girl, Santa Monica, Everything to Everyone or Normal Like You, and Learning How to Smile sounds too much like Summerland).Most of the other songs are rather mediocre. Still, the worse Everclear song beats anything from Britney Spears or 'N Sync. Buy this one if you already have Everclear's other releases, otherwise I would start with Sparkle and Fade. I am anxiously awaiting the Vol 2 release!"
3,More diverse than the last album.,"I think that Everclear's new album is a good, if not great, attempt at growing from their previous work. The music on this album is much more diverse than their previous works. It is a good album that you can listen to from start to finish. It perfectly captures the sound of a California summer. I do think that sometimes Art's voice can get irritating. I also wish that this album was a little bit ""harder"". All in all a good album. Some standout tracks are ""Here We Go Again"", ""Learning How to Smile"", ""Brown Eyed Girl"", and the current single ""Wonderful""."
4,Feel good Rock music,"For a kid who grew up with the music of the seventies and eighties and loves alternative music as an adult, this is the perfect balance of ""feel good"" pop and current alternative rock. I've listened to the whole CD (without skipping past any of the songs) and I'm hooked. This CD has a lot of heart put into it, from the songs and references about his daughter to the tributes for the songs we loved as kids. Great Job, Everclear!"
4,Songs from an American Movie Vol. 1,"I too, bought Afterglow first and discovered that this band grows on you. There's something catchy and appealing about their music. While I'm not a big fan of sampling, Everclear makes it work on ""Here We Go Again"" and ""AM Radio"", the latter blending the sampling almost seamlessly into the rest of the song. The remake of Van Morrison's ""Brown Eyed Girl"" seems to flow around the percussion. I definitely recommend this."
5,Excellent!!!!,"I was hesitant to buy this CD. I love ...Afterglow but after reading the mixed reviews on this one, I wondered. I finally did and wish I'd bought it right away. It is excellent! There isn't one track on here that I don't like, which is a great accomplishment for any CD I think. It's great to see a band that can change its sound and still be appealing. As for the remake of ""Brown Eyed Girl"" I don't see why there are complaints. If it sounded just like Van Morrison, what would be the point of doing it? This is an absolute must!"
3,All right,"""AM Radio"", ""Wonderful"", ""Unemployed Boyfriend"", and ""Annabella's Song"" were all really great. The rest of the album came across (to me) as too slow, as if they were trying to hard to get something across. I was really disappointed with their ""Brown Eyed Girl"". They redid it so differently that it's hardly recognizable, and the lyrics are almost drowned out by the music. ""Wonderful"" made it worth it, though, and it'll probably grow on me. Number 2, they say, should be more like the Everclear we know. I certainly hope so."
4,good,"This is my first Everclear cd and i was pleasantly suprised. I found that this is one of those rare cd's that i can listen to all the way through. Not all the songs are great, but none are bad. Overall this is a pretty good cd; not great . . . but close."
2,Fun Stuff for the Kids,"I was suprised by the change in focus on this disc. Everclear's earlier work demonstrated an emotional edge and typically focused on adult themes. This latest release, however, seems to be aimed at a much younger audience. The songs are cuter and less provocative, and even the angst-ridden ""Wonderful"" has a Sesame St. feel to it (today's lesson...counting to 10).As usual, the music is tight and well produced. ""A.M. Radio"" and ""Brown Eyed Girl"" are fun songs, as would be ""Unemployed Boyfriend"" without the silly narrative. All in all, however, I was disappointed."
5,Best EC album!,"Thats right I said it! This is the best album they ever and probably will make, but one of the reasons I love this band is that each cd is different and can stand on its own. ""Unemployed Boyfriend"" is one of the greatest songs of all time."
1,Very Disappointing,"I am a huge Everclear fan. I have their 3 previous efforts, a couple live albums and have seen them in concert 4 times. This is not an Everclear album. A case of too many acoustic guitars and electronic ""beeps."" It is a little too soft and ""sappy"" for my taste. Unfortunately this has been the pattern for many great bands (i.e. The Police, Clash and Rancid). I can only take solace in the fact that they are currently working on a ""rock"" album due this winter. We'll have to wait and see."
