1,Not happy with this toaster - many problems,"Received this toaster as a Christmas present in 2004. From day one I was not very happy with it. The knobs and temperature control are difficult to use - sometimes it would bake good, other times it would not. About 6 months ago I noticed the numbers were rubbed off of the timer dial. About 3 months ago the timer dial became loose and it was difficult to set the time. Today the timer dial broke off completely. So I got about a year and a half of poor use out of it. So, don't purchase this product, it is not worth it."
2,both racks too close to heating element!,"Well, I didn't have the really awful problems other people had, like knobs falling off and fires, but this thing is pretty hard to use, because both rack positions are too close to the heating element. Neither one hits the middle of the oven. The top one is like an inch from the top heating element, and the bottom one is about an inch from the bottom heating element! Was there no quality control on this thing? Did the people who made it not understand that you need to hit the middle? It's impossible to cook anything evenly, and nearly impossible not to burn everything. Also it's about 25 degrees hotter than the setting says. I do like how the bottom tray slides out - it's easy to clean. But other than that, not good."
2,My toast caught on fire!,"Not only does this toaster oven toast bread unevenly, it even causes it to catch on fire at times. Even when toasting for 5 minutes on the ""Toast"" setting, my piece of bread caught on fire, filled the entire house with smoke and set off every one of my fire alarms. This does not seem to be a safe product. I am discontinuing use of mine and will purchase another brand."
5,great toaster,This toaster oven is great. One can bake a variety of foods in it. It is quite efficient too.
3,Great bang for buck,"A gift for our wedding seven years ago. I eat a lot of toast. Minimum 2 slices a day. Oven has been rock solid with no major issues. Good as a broiler too. You can't go wrong for the money.However, it does come with a few limitations. First, the metal part on the glass door that pulls out the tray does not work great and is prone to bending. Had to re-bend almost daily by hand to get the door to close tightly. This was the units death nil as it finally fell out if it's metal fitting in the door and no longer works. Second, there is no fine tuning with the timer. If your fast cooking less couple minutes, like toast, you better keep on eye on it or burning will occur. Lastly, the timer is loud."
1,Junk,As with many reviews the timer knob broke after 3 months. Tried to get one through Toastmaster and Salton with no luck. Total junk!
1,"For a ""toaster oven,"" it doesn't know how to do toast!","I am very disappointed in my toaster oven. I originally bought this when my regular toaster died, so that I would have more flexibility. But the thing just does not know how to toast!Although it has a toaster knob, even the very lowest setting burns my toast.I have yet to get a good meal of any kind out of this product. I am looking for a replacement [from a differetn manufacturer!)."
2,Do not buy this toaster oven!,"I like the size, timer, cool exterior, and automatic shut-off feature. Too bad the numbers around the time and temperature knobs start rubbing off after about 2 months. I burned lots of food before I figured out how much to lower the temperature. Food still doesn't cook well- cooks unevenly. Company has replaced the oven twice, since it's still under warranty. The third one sits unopened waiting for me to decide what to do with it. I can't bear to replace it another time knowing it will just be the same. I bought a new GE one today. I'll never buy another Toastmaster!"
1,"Doesn't work well, unless you like stuff burned!","We bought this to replace our ancient Black & Decker toaster oven/broiler when we moved. It does not even come close to being as good as the B & D. It has a dial that supposedly helps you determine how dark the toast should be - well, half the time, the dial does not work. You stop hearing the ticking sound and if you're not paying very close attention, your stuff gets burned! It's a waste of money. Don't bother, no matter how cheap."
4,Pretty Good Oven for the $$$$,"This toaster oven doesn't have all the bells and whistles of some, and yes, you hear the tick tick tick of the timer, however, for cooking things you don't wish you waste full size oven energy on, this is really great. Also, the size of the inside makes it more useful, as you don't have to ""only"" use the included pan (which incidently is difficut to clean if any grease cooks on). Any 8x8 square or round pans will work, and the height of the grate is adjustable. For some of the complaints i've seen, i'm surprised because it has been a good purchase for me. I suppose they might be satisfied with one if they spent more than $25.00. Over all, a good oven for a great price."
2,A big disappointment,"Well, yes, it does cook food and has a timer. However, it replaces my old GE that I had for over 20 years. The main problem is that it leaks. Yes, even skinned chicken breasts with a light coating of olive oil and garlic powder leaks out a brownish liquid on the kitchen counter, something my old GE did not do.It also discolors. The clean white finish has turned brownish in places and will not come clean. It's like it was baked into the plastic. Definitely would not recommend it unhless you can't afford something more expensive. I will toss mine soon and buy a better quality product."
1,Broke in under one month,"This was a great item and I enjoyed using it for ""meals for one."" Unfortunately, the timer dial broke in less than a month which renders the whole thing useless.Tip: save the box it came in. You may need to ship it back."
2,It's difficult to gauge...,"I needed to replace my 17 year old toaster oven and I settled on this one. For toasting, I really don't like it. The turn dial really makes it difficult to set so that you don't burn your toast and the tick tick tick ticking is annoying.The rack also sits crookedly and I can't figure out if I'm doing something wrong or it's the oven itself. I would never buy this again.Oh, as for cooking little frozen pizzas, it's great and the slide out crumb tray does make it easy to clean, a lot better than hanging onto the toaster while shaking the entire thing over the trashcan."
1,Terrible and dangerous,"I've had two fires while making toast. Smoke alarms screeching. No control over toast even when using the ""little dial"". This oven gets very hot. Just moved into a new house and wanted something small until I decided on a few small appliances. Save your money and buy something insulated and reliable. Very dangerous around small children. (Should have kept my old Black and Decker; I had it for 8 years without a single problem.)"
2,Ummm... the smell of burned toast in the morning,"We have had this toaster for about one month. Everyone who uses the toaster to make toast, burns the toast until they get use to the controls. The only saving grace of this toaster is the automatic timer that shuts off. It is great for cooking frozen foods (i.e. french fries, fish sticks etc.). However, I have been very unhappy with using this toaster to make toast."
3,Toast on Fire!!!,My toast caught on fire the second time that I used this toaster. You can't really rely on the timer because I think the heat that is emmitted is too strong.
3,Not What I expected,"I've enjoyed other work performed by the two main actors but in this instance, they flopped. I normally watch the films in my library several times but this one has only been viewed once and I think it will take quite a bit to get me interested in it again."
5,excellent work,"This textbook represents one of the most comprehensive, up-to-date sources on child neurology. It expertly synthesizes state-of-the-art knowledge from a variety of disciplines, including clinical medicine, pathology, genetics, physiology, biochemistry, and related fields. Although the primary focus is on clinical evaluation and management, the book also examines the sophisticated technology that has been revolutionizing the field."
5,FULL OF INFORMATION AT A BARGAIN PRICEFULL OF INFORMATION A,"I can't imagine any serious massage practitioner that would not benefit greatly from this series. It is absolutely full of not only specific techniques to expand my skills, but also demonstrates the subtleties of touch and theory that actually qualitatively change the way that I work. I've been a therapist for over ten years, and my regular clients immediately noticed the improvement in my work-not just some new strokes but a whole new way of working. For 11 hours of serious instruction that I will review many times, I think this is some of the best money I've ever invested on bodywork education"
3,Not the original artists,"We needed a version of ""Bird Dance"". This disc looked like a good option because it contains numerous other goofy dance tunes. The disc serves the purpose for which it was purchased but it is not one that I am going to play more than once."
2,"Only 30 min playing time, not 60!","I bought this DVD along with the Christmas DVD episode of Word World, because my son loves the series and i liked the idea of buying the holiday-oriented ones. But there is only 30 min of actual episode playing time on this - it is not 60 min. The other 30 min are commercials. In my opinion, 30 min of commercials, along with 2 15 min episodes, does not add up to '60 min playing time' and therefore this DVD is not worth the money i paid for it. I won't be purchasing any more of these 2-episode sets."
3,Only 2 episodes,"My son loves Wordworld!! I love word world. He is 2 1/2 years old and can spell now. He is writing letters and can identify 23 letters of the alphabet. However, In the description for this video, it says 60 minutes of running time. If you consider half of that time being commercials for other annoying shows to be worth your money, then cool. If not, this is 30 minutes of run time."
5,Very cute!!!,My daughter loves this DVD! She is 3 & 1/2 and already reading thanks in part to shows like this!!!
5,Contents,"viking wayson the viking age in sweden1980This small but informative book draws on archaeological finds and runic inscriptions to offer insights into the life of the Vikings--their settlements and homes, their food, their ships, Viking towns, sea routes, their religion and their sagas and laws.32 pages, English, Illustrations: B/W ~24, Color ~ 5ISBN 9152000893"
5,The true story of Gulf War veteran David Eberly,"Faith Beyond Belief is the true story of Gulf War veteran David Eberly. Written in his own words, Eberly survived being shot down in the Iraqi desert and after being captured was to spend forty-three days in the prison cells of Baghdad. A story of faith as well as the struggle for survival, penned by a deeply religious soldier who trusted in God to care for his soul, Faith Beyond Belief is singularly powerful reading and highly recommended for military buffs with an interest in the Gulf War, as well as anyone having to cope with life's manifold challenges and adversities."
4,Poor Jackson,"I love the Sally Harrington novels and I'm so glad that she finally found the love of her life. You can understand her life because we all face alot of this in our own lives.I was disappointed in the Cassy, Alexandra, Jackson love triangle. None of the other books put Jackson in a bad light and a person can change. I think that Van Wormer put a bad light on Jackson to make everything else seem right.Yes, before he married Cassy, he was quite the playboy--but he seemed to really love Cassy & she loved him in the previous books.I enjoyed the book but hated what happened to Jackson."
2,Not very exciting,"I ordered this book because it was set in Connecticut, and I enjoyed that part. It seemed that it took a long time to get anywhere in this book. Eventhough Sally is the focus of the murders, you just really don't care very much."
3,Mr. Murder,"Sally Harrington is given a newscast of her own, and her romantic woes are fairly well settled, though not quite. Then, the bodies start to fall. She is the last person to interview a millionaire before he is killed; a corpse turns up at Sally's Connecticut home, and things get very dangerous all around. The police find a connection between the deaths, and there is a real chance that Sally herself is at risk. It will be a race against time to save her from a killer with a deadly agenda.*** Fans of the series may enjoy this; however, coming into it cold, there will be times new readers have say what moments. There are some very disturbing moments scattered throughout the book, and the ""heroes"" often seem less than heroic. However, it is a puzzling mystery to solve. ***Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer"
5,it made relentless stinging ridiculous pain go away,"Aloe alone didn't work. I think it actually dried the burn out more. So nothing was helping. I thought I was going to have to go to the emergency room. ha. so anyways, solarcaine spray was the only thing that worked and worked almost instantly. i like solarcaine so much i would buy stock in their company."
2,rennet,"may be for the beginner work rennet tablet but soon you figure out that the rennet only 20% coagulation effect, in relation the fluid rennet work 80% With the rennet tablet is it better the double volume use than on the recepie."
5,Good design and features,"Haven't had any snow to try it on yet, but it has nice features such as a handle to point and angle the deflector and recoil rope mounted to handle. Very similar to Toro model in looks and mechanics. Minor assembly required to attach the top part of the handle and power engagement cable."
2,Overblown and ordinary,"It's evident that Kube-McDowell cut his literary teeth watching nebbish tv shows and mediocre movies. The plot structure carries the story as well as can be expected, but the language and characters are pedestrian at best. Where Kube-McDowell strives for passion, he loses control and becomes hackneyed. If the author can't truly care for his characters, why should I? Not recommended."
1,this tv is horrible,"i had recently purchased a hitachi 51f510 hd projection tv used for a reasonable price, it had to be serviced because one of the component inputs in the back went bad and i have no idea why...anyways this is the tv that they gave me while mine was away being serviced and i was surprised. this tv has an absolutely horrible picture and the best display it has is 480p or 1080i which are both only possible with component cables. i have charter digital cable and it looks like somebody rubbed sand in my eyes the picture is so grainy. to make a long story short----dont buy this tv if you are looking for a good picture, but do buy it if you are looking for an enourmous paper weight"
3,Ace Combat Advance simplistic yet fun,Although simplistic it is a fun game. The graphics are nice for the style of gameplay(overhead view). Though not easy in the easy setting still a game great for a rainy day or to pass the time. i believe you should not have to pay more then $12. Worthy only of 3 stars.
1,Not Much Use,Too much feminist claptrap - totally missed the point - has no idea how to reason on this issue - don't waste your time.
4,Well researched and told,"I wanted to know who Werner Voss was, what he was like. This book is well researched and also adds to describe the character of Voss well, to leave you with a feeling of what the young man must have been like. In so much as it can, from a part of aviation history when pilots were just trying to get principles of combat flying down, and when most of them accomplished it by intuition alone."
1,"If works, it still won't","The GBP302KIT is comprised of the GBP301 printer combo adapter (USB and parallel connectors),the GBU211 USB adapter, a power brick, USB cable and driver disk. The only problem is only one part of this kit works, and its not the printer adapter. Check out the other reviews on the GBP301. We bought this for our small office and could not make it work even after spending 4 hours with IOGear support. The GBP301 just would not accept a connection to any of our desktop printers, HPs, Epson, Lexmark, none of them worked (and remember that this kit definitely will not work with multifuction printers, by design). You'll also need to download the drivers from IOGear's support site because the drivers on the included CD do not work according to their own tech support people."
2,underwhelmed,"If you are sitting close to your printer it is not a bad item, also you may have to ""resend"" to the printer several times before it engages and prints. A little frustrating, I would not recommend."
2,Picnic at Hanging Rock Sound Track--Not,"OK, it was my error. I thought this was the sound track to Picnic at Hanging Rock---the movie. It is a pan flute album and not the sound track I wanted from the movie. Only one cut is from the movie. Yep, I know I should have read the names of the cuts but I didn't. It is OK for what it is and the price was cheap but I was/am really looking for the sound track. I think the title is deceiving."
1,hmmm,"I'm also looking for the original soundtrack and wondered about this one because one of the other tracks was Miranda's Song or Theme. Thanks for your review! Saved me from disappointment.You might want to do what I ended up doing. Use an audio recording device on your computer, play the DVD and record from that."
1,"THIS THING SUCKS, STAY AWAY.","Please, stay away from this piece of crap. I regret buying it and it is the worst possible thing meant for a game in existance. I'm obviously exaggerating but you get my point. I hate this thing and would return it if i could. But i can't, so i just let it sit in my closet.The reasons this thing sucks:1: The wammy bar is VERY loose.2: The strum bar is clacky and gets stuck and is just hard to deal with in general.3: The bottons get stuck and are really hard to press down.4: The star power doesn't even work! I had to lift AND shake the guitar for it to even register that something is there.5: Finally, it's too small anyway and it feels awkward.So, all in all, just buy something crappier IF YOU CAN. Chances are it's better anyway."
1,DON'T BUY THE SHREDDER (AKA: JUNKER) GUITAR!,"I bought this from Fry's and thought it was broke, so I exchanged it for another of the same guitar. It still acts broke. Frets get stuck, shake it for star power, wammy you have to slam it like crazy to work, It's cheap junk, that cost me $45.00, Not worth buying. Take it back if you have the chance. I hate the people who made this piece of junk!"
1,"guitar hero ""shredder"" by pro jammin",this controller was a piece of garbage since i can't use stronger language. it worked for just about ten minutes before it stopped working all together. i wouldn't reccommend it to my worst enemy. the only thing this guitar non-controller might be good for is a wall ornament or maybe if you need a target for skeet shooting. i was so angry that i didn't even bother trying to get my money back.
1,horrible purchase,I ordered this item well over a month ago and I never received it. I tried contacting the seller and never got a reply. I reported two claims to Amazon and I eventually got my money back. This purchase caused way too much stress and I never even received it. If I could give this item less than one star I would.
2,guitar hero 1,"this guitar hero controller is only compatible with guitar hero 1 game. I was unaware of this fact when I purchased the item, but was sent an adapter when I notified the seller. Be aware of this inconveniece."
5,GREAT!!!!,"This book is a masterpiece. When I first heard about it from a friend, I decided to read it, and I am really glad I did! I read all the books in the Mennyms series at least twice, and did book reports on two of them. A couple years ago, when I heard that a new addition to the series was coming out, I was thrilled. I waited and waited for that book, and when it finally came, I wasn't let down. That book was as great as all the other books! You should definately read the first Mennyms book, if not all of them! When I saw the Mennyms on my school's summer reading list, I was so happy that all the students at my school were going to get to be so lucky and discover the Mennyms. THE MENNYMS IS A GREAT BOOK! READ IT!!!!!!!"
4,Good Ideas and Plot sort of confusing,"Overall this book is probably one of the best books I have ever read, there is only one small problem. If you do not know anything about the book, the book will probably seem a little confusing. The plot the exspressions etc. were good. So, before you read this book you might want to understand what they are a little bit more and just some more details."
3,Decent season,"I am also bewildered as to why CMH was released before the first two seasons. It makes no sense. While I would agree that this season doesn't stack up to its predecessors, it isn't that bad. It has some hillarious moments and sure, the players are light-hearted but I wouldn't say they weren't taking the game seriously. Kathy was a vigorous note-taker and Michael and Erik were very intense at times. In addition, Frederique amounts to being a very good mole, far better than Bill or Kathryn, so in that respect, this season has a leg up on the first two. The challenges are also pretty darn good. I thought ""Underwater Charades"" and ""It Takes a Thief"" were brilliantly thought up games.This DVD really isn't worth buying if you saw this season, but if you've yet to see this season then I say go out and buy it."
2,The show was better during the first two seasons,"The show was better during the first two seasons whenordinary people instead of celebrities were on it. Andwhy wasn't Anderson Cooper the host for the 3rd and4th editions of the Mole?Even the challenges were better in the first two editionsof the Mole. I don't know what the programming peopleat ABC were thinking when they replaced ordinary peoplewith celebrities.Please, ABC put ordinary people back on the show instead ofof celebrities for future editions of the Mole!"
2,First time Mole watcher?,"Don't get this. Why? First, it's not the best season to show you and get you hooked. Second, it's $10 more than the best season so far on DVD, The Mole Complete First Season. Get that first, then if you like, buy this DVD to feed youself until the second season comes out on DVD."
2,Please release the first two seasons!,"Why they would release the Celebrity seasons of The Mole on DVD instead of the first two is beyond me. These celebrities are not concerned with playing the game as regular non-celebrity players are, but rather with maintaining their public image, which makes for a very dumb and boring show."
1,Read a biography on celebrities instead..,"Celebrity Mole....Oh my... Why on earth would you spend money on buying a reality show that doesn't even take itself seriously? Honestly, the washed-up actors and host are having fun simply for the fact that this is the only paycheck they've seen in two decades. ""Celebrity Mole's"" two stinky seasons aren't anything compared to the first two ""The Mole"" editions with Anderson Cooper as the host and real people as the players. Here, the clues are phony and acting even phonyer."
2,bury it,"What a waste of time.A good idea ruined by the antics of ""celebs"" trying to outshine each other with stupid antics.I threw mine away after two episodes."
1,A River Lost = Eyes Wide SHUT,"This anti-development propaganda is typical of those who live off the development but don't know what the people went through to get it there. His historical information is misinformed and his quotes of ""locals"" are misrepresented.A very sad, missed opportunity to tell the story of how people and the environment change over time."
5,So much good information,"A full and complete modern history of the Columbia River. At times sad, always intriging. Harden has done an excellent job of combining interviews with research that makes an excellent read.Highly recommmended."
3,"A good read, entertaining, but rather shallow in conclusions","The author has done his homework, but allowed his personal PC-ness to strangle his conclusions. He is quick and mighty to blame the ""Republican Congress"" for what he perceives to be current failure, while he completely and naively fails to see, and never reports, that it was 50+ years of Democrats who ""did it ""!! It was, never the less, a good read with many clever and poignant word pictures."
5,breath taking,"another first class book from rainer schlegelmilch, this master racing photogragphy has captured the awesome and sometimes brutal power produced by formula 1 cars of this era.highly recomended"
2,"Beautiful photographs, very low quality print","The photographs in this book are awesome. However, as in other books from Haynes (i.e. all Formula 1 Season Review) the print is low quality. This could have been an excellent art book if the photographs were printed right. Low color saturation, wrong hue, cooling filter effect (all photographs look blue). I've seen many of this pictures in other books and they are just beautiful... not here. I'm thinking in returning my copy."
4,Yearly years of tv,"Betty White Show 1 includes 4 episodes of Life with Elizabeth tv-show from the fifties. Sweet Betty White and Del Moore are on the main roles. How muh tv has changed since those days! So innocent, so sweet, the golden years of tv."
3,"Ok as a novelty item, but stick with a regular blender","I bought this blender because it was supposed to be designed to make smoothies and iced drinks and that was all I wanted it for. It did blend fairly well and the spout is convenient when you're making drinks...BUT it broke down within a few months of occasional use and it was an extra hassle to clean. The liquid started leaking out of the bottom, and I haven't bothered to fix it because I have an excellent 12 speed Hamilton Beach blender with mini food processor attachment. That blender blends as well or better and it's dish washer safe. The big difference is that Hamilton Beach has hung on for a few years so far with no problems."
3,Balthazar B,"I like books that revel in their own literary-ness, but this book went a bit overboard. Great vocabulary, but just a bit too ""into itself""."
3,Quick but not long lasting.,I have used this product a few times now on my two dogs.The nice thing is it kills flea right then and there...they are gone.The bad thing is the fleas will be back within 24 hours or less.So as nice as it is to be rid of the fleas it doesn't keep them off the animal for any good deal of time.I will finish off the bottle over time I am sure but once its gone I will not be purchasing it again.
1,This product killed my 13 year old chihuahua.,WARNING THIS PRODUCT IS UNSAFE FOR SMALL DOGS. I had two chihuahua's I now have one with severe twitching and nerve pain. The other one died from repeated seizures after using this product. He went into seizures 5 minutes after using the product and two weeks later he had to be put to sleep because he was seizing constantly. This product should be labeled POISON.
1,WARNING!!!,I would not use this shampoo if i was you. My dog had fleas so i picked up this shampoo for my dog at Petland and the next day my dog had uncontrollable shaking. I had to bring him to the vet and the vet said it was the shampoo that the Hartz Flea shampoo has done this to many dogs. Stay far away from this shampoo if i was you.
1,Warning!,"I have used this product on a regular basis, on several different dogs over the past 20 years or so, because it does seem to work well at keeping fleas under control.HOWEVER....Our newest dog, a Chihuahua named Foxy, has shown me that this product can cause major seizures in dogs. Within 2 hours of bathing her she had a terrible seizure, then a few weeks later the same thing happened. She has only had 1 other since I stopped using this product, a week later. So far she seems ok, a month later. But after doing some research I have discovered that we were far from alone. How this product is still on the shelves is beyond me! [...] is 1 of many sites with much information on how dangerous and deadly this shampoo and the Hartz drops can be. Good Luck!"
1,THIS STUFF MADE MY DOG SICK !!!!!,"It killed the fleas sure and made her sick within a few hours !! DO NOT BUY THIS. I have a 53 pound english Bulldog. I bathed her with this product that I thought was safe because of the name brand. HA, what a lie. I am telling everyone and posting this on youtube as I have it on video. [...] because they seem to have alot of bad products out there. I had no idea !!!! HARTZ is awful. This company has an incredible number of animal injuries and deaths.don't believe me? start doing a search on it. [...] SICK SICK SICK company to rake in money and not care about our beloved PETS !!!"
3,More gambling stories...less personal woe-is-me,"Many of the stories are very entertaining. His ""The Man With the $100,000 Breasts"" was fantastic and highly recommended. This book would be similarly recommended but for the fact that Mr. Konick spends too much time telling us about his forlorn love life (all seemingly with Swedish model-type women with PhD's)and how awfully he is treated by his girlfriends, his superiority at the poker table, how horrible Jim MacManus's writing and card skills are, etc. He should stick with stories about others instead of showing how full of himself he is."
2,stories,Its a story book not a book on how to actually play poker better. But thats my fault for not finding that out before i bought it. oh well.
5,Strong Stuff,"No you won't learn how to play a small pair in early position from this book. This is all about the psychology and emotions of gambling. Konik is probably the best writer of all the gambling pundits when it comes to telling it like it is warts and all. A very honest book. You gotta feel for the guy even if he seems to get more women than the average poker player. He knows he's not that great of a player. He belongs on T.V. talking about the game not playing it.The shorter stories about sports and blackjack are highly educational and amusing. Good chapter about ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.""This is the kind of book you can dip into a few chapters at a time in between watching Konik on T.V. acting like he knows what he's talking about. Mr. Konik, stick to writing. You're the best."
1,The National Enquirer of Gambling Books,"Half this book is a series of re-printed airline magazine articles-- written in a highly sensationalized, non-informative style. The other half of the book chronicles various aspects of the WSOP, including some of the authors' personal bad beat stories. Ho Hum.The worst of 40 gambling books I own... look elsewhere"
5,Journey into the past,"The more you study history, the more ones learns that people are the same. These reproduction of daily life show people communicating (whether out the window or at the local taverns) instead of on the phone or via electronic devices. And that bad dreams could be communicated to the canvas before the movie screen was invented."
5,"A ""Real Life"" Poetry Book","I've read quite a few books of poetry and none have been as easy to relate to as Ms. Fritz's book. She writes about things that everyone can relate to in such a beautiful and unique way. Some poets like to write very abstract poetry, but THESE poems are easy to get a hold of, visually and emotionally. ""Fruitless Mission"", ""A Kindred Spirit"" and ""The Dark Space"" are among my favorites. This a book every poetry lover MUST HAVE!"
2,"Much pain, no gain","This set was a big disappointment. I have been using Hemelaya Behl's dvd for a couple of years and thought that I might try something faster-paced.I won't say that this is not yoga, but it is not the sort of yoga practice that I want to do. I consider myself to be in pretty good shape and I ended up pulling a calf muscle doing one of the pilates workouts.If you are into aerobics and want to add some yoga to the mix, give this set a try. It just isn't for me.I do recommend Behl's dvds over this one.I will be selling my mtv set."
4,Go take a class,"Ok,ok the video is clear and they have special sections on each disc that breaks down the poses. I tried this and it's ok, but really I felt I should have taken an introduction to yoga class first. Which eventually I did."
1,ARG!!!!,"I hate these videos. They move too fast for beginers and are usless for anyone else. Do not buy these, it is a waste of money."
5,Love it!,"I've only done the yoga and pilates workouts as I'm working my way up to the other 2; they are approximately 40 mins and 37 minutes respectively. I love them both. I find Kristin McGee to be perfect for these types of workouts and instruction. There's beginner, intermediate and advanced versions of each pose so you can follow either one, depending on your fitness level. I do find them to be easier as I continue to do them, so they definitely work. My core is much stronger and I'm more flexible than before. I try to do them at least twice a week. I would definitely recommend these DVDs for all levels of pilates and yoga. And don't worry that you are not getting a workout; you will feel this and sweat a little. Great workouts and I'll be moving on to the power yoga and pilates mix very soon. I'll update my review once I've tried the others."
2,Not stable but does do the job,"I have used this hitch to drive across the country but you have to tie it down really well it keep the bike from flopping around. I don't trust the tie-downs that are on the product. Very flimsy. But, it's cheap and does get the job done."
2,ughh...,"I was looking for a concert video and thought this was going to be a good purchase...instead this is one video after the other of the band, not a live show...not worth the purchase from that perspective!"
1,?,"sounds like iaan dead is the producer of this album. take note that ""most"" listeners do NOT like their music ""remixed"" as mix master iaan seems to think."
3,Mediocrity.,"Although most of the music is generic rehash, there are a few decent tunes. The main selling point is the price. For 6 hours of music, to throw in @ a party, ya can't beat the price. Sometimes ya just need some background noise."
5,Living Stereo was the real deal,"Thoroughly enjoy this classic rendition by maestro Fritz Reiner. Even without a SACD player, this CD has sonic brilliance, highly recommend."
3,Reiner on fire but dated sound!,"No question about Fritz Reiner having absolute control over the Chicago Symphony Orchestra here. The playing and precision of the CSO is first rate. As for the sound I bought this SACD version hoping for a sound as fresh as some of the other Reiner RCA Living Stereo SACD reissues, but these recordings lack sparkle and 3D ambience even compared to some of my ordinary CD recordings of the same material."
3,A Good CD with a BIG mistake in it!,"The New World Symphony is the best blended and most musical I've ever heard, but the end of the Polka and Fugue everyone, except the tubist, is playing too loud. Its blatty and offensive to me especially the trumpets. Don't get me wrong I like loud playing but not when the whole section is in unison. Also there is a very loud wrong note in the trumpets in the last statement of the subject! It's kind of funny! Anyways everything else about this CD is very good. Especially the New World Symphony."
2,skimming the surface,"I was very disappointed in the lack of depth of Embracing the Goddess Within. There is approxamately a paragraph stating the history or outline of the story concerning each goddess, then another page devoted to a ""ritual"" to connect with that goddess. I was aching for more substance... to use a familiar goddess, Aphrodite, as an example, Waldherr basically says that she's a greek goddess of romantic love, unwilling wife of Vulcan, etc. Then the ""ritual"" is to take a bath in rosepetals. I expected to gain some deeper understanding behind the culture of each goddess, but it's little more than what you would find in a ""mythological encyclopedia."""
4,Nice introduction to Goddesses around the world,"My scholarly devotion to paganism had once followed a decidely Celtic path. That is until I picked up this book shortly after seeing Waldherr's Goddess Tarot. While it does not give an in-depth treatment of the selected goddesses, it gives you a taste of other traditions. The cultural diversity of this book is responsible for piquing my interest in Tara, Sarasvati, Kali Ma and Quan Yin - goddesses I now hold dear. I also think this would be a lovely book to give to your non-pagan girlfriends who you wish to gently introduce to your beliefs. Worth checking out."
4,Beautiful Art,"A beautifully bound (hardbound), illustrated and written book on goddesses. The only complaint is that I wish there had been a little more information."
5,Fantastic! Bruford & company keep with jazz tradition,"Jazz purists, take heart! Earthworks' first release of the new millenium once again features virtuosos Bill Bruford (drums), Mark Hodgson (bass), Patrick Clahar (saxes), and Steve Hamilton (piano). This lineup's second effort takes the ensemble even closer to trad jazz roots with compositions like ""Teaching Vera To Dance,"" with it's prominent featuring of bass and sax. Also enjoyable is Earthworks' new twist on ""Never the Same Way Once,"" a cut from the 1997 Bruford/Towner/Gomez disc, ""If Summer Had Its Ghosts."" ""The Sound of Surprise"" should appeal to diehard Bruford fans as well as trad jazz and fusion fans alike. Absolutely gorgeous all around! This Japanese import features an extra (tenth) track, aptly entitled ""The Sound of Surprise."""
2,Dissapointed this time,I expected more from Bill Bruford and am disappointed this time. The best thing about it is the art work on the cover!
3,Not what I thought.,"I saw ""race kit"" & thought it meant the whole car. I guess this is to supe up the one you already have. I guess I should've figured it out b/c it was super cheap. Oh, well, lesson learned. Research before purchasing. I suppose if you already have the car, this might be good."
1,Camera not very good,"While I wasn't expecting a great camera. This one did not take good pictures of any type. Most of the pictures where either too dark, too light or blurry. Would not recommend VuPoint for anything."
1,Total JUNK,The title says it all.Picture quality is awful.The interface is very clumsy and difficult to use.
1,Sirius has terrible service,I had my service for 14 days. I took it back to Circuit City twice because it was not working- service was either full of static or not working at all. Circuit City replaced with XM radio and it works perfectly. Sirius charged me a $75.00 cancellation fee and would not waive it even though the service never worked. I appealed to customer service and they said I was out of luck.You should by XM radio instead of Sirius.

3,Name Brand Low Quality,I bought these because i believed in the brand name for windows. i only payed for the name. the quality is no better than cheap ones at the dollar store.
1,Junk,I should have paid attenion to the previous reviewer. This curtain rod is of poor quality. The mounting hardware is terrible. Pay a bit more and get something substantial.
2,Light-weight rod,"Product is slightly flimsy compared to those I've handled in many other stores. Since the rod will be used for a very light-weight valance, I decided to keep it as it probably would cost more to return it. The s/h was actually twice as much as the seller's listed price for the rod. Would definitely buy at a retail store next time."
3,Amber Butterfly ring,"I received this ring today and while it is a pretty ring it isn't what I expected. The sizing runs large, I ordered a five however it fits more like a six. The ring a received has a different color combination than the one pictured (mine has the yellow and green amber on the top wings and the cognac color on the bottom wings). Also the sterling silver 925 stamp is on the outside of the band instead of the inside."
3,now has OCR,"V4 has OCR built in. V3 came bundled with omnipage pro 14 and would activate omnipage for OCR. V4 in general produces better formatted conversion to a word doc than does Acrobat 7 and is a handy program to have, though far from perfect. A nice feature is that the preferences allow you to deselect scansoft toolbars for MS Office, yet V4 will still launch if you try to open a pdf within Word."
2,French women...,"..do get fat. The whole world has had a blast laughing at how fat Americans are. Have you been outside Manhattan or Berkeley lately? Europeans are getting fat - fast, as are Asians. Welcome the the Modern World!"
1,Disappointing,"I have very unimpressed with the book. It is not a diet book and it is not a good story either. Unfortunately, it appears to have become a best seller because in America, people are always looking for ""the one formula"" that will be the end to bad eating habits and attitudes to food.The author has no qualms to advertise the company and products she works for, and that made her assertions even less credible.The more disappointing fact about this book is that is written by a wealthy, city-living, traveled and cosmopolitan woman and little research was done on the impossiblity of Americans from a different back ground to have a French lifestyle. I do not think it is possible to walk into the forest, pick fresh wild mushrooms and eat them accompanied by a glass of bubbly as an appetizer to your daily meal.The fast-pace and expensiveness of fresh produce in America makes this book irrelevant for users in this country. The rest we all know is common sense."
1,Not worth the money - just more French snobbery!,"This book is not that good. It's written in a fun, Cosmo-magazine-style way. Basically, it's a long magazine article with a few recipes mixed in, which aren't bad, by the way. Although this book can be read in a few hours and is not meant to be taken that seriosly, I think many readers are.I agree with the premise that good food should be a priority and fresh ingredients are essential to maintain health and good eats so to speak. I don't agree with her stereotypically ""French"" attitude that only the best will do. It would be nice to shop for fresh produce year round and pay pennies for it, but where I am that's just not the case. Anyway, a lot of this book is just plain old rude, and superior and not that cool.Save your money and check it out from the library if you want to and xerox the recipes you think look good.There are much better books out there."
4,Well written!,A well written book and a theory that makes sense. Written in laymens terms and with good research to back it up. Worth the price!
2,This is a novel NOT a diet book,"The idea was great, stop pretending chocolate and carbs don't exist but enjoy them in moderation and in balance with the rest of your meals. The problem is not with the advice in the book, it's with finding the advice in the book. Page after page of stories and histories of food. That's fine, that's lovely, but I bought this book to learn about loosing weight, not to learn about the author's mother or what duke simply loved mushrooms. I got more advice on this form of dieting by reading the reviews of the books online than by reading the book itself. Save yourself ten bucks and read articles on google about the principles of this diet rather than wasting days of your life trying to pull them from this poorly organized novel."
3,Good Book For Weight Loss Beginners,"Should be called ""Why Upper Middle Class French Women Don't Get Fat.""Another good weight loss starter book.A big problem with how we eat is that we've moved away from having culture around our food.Now, this doesn't mean super haute cuisine, but rather rules about how and what we eat. You know, traditionally everyone ate dinner together (and ate the same thing!) and now we don't. Dinner together was part of food culture.This book is basically a blueprint of the author's food culture rules. ""Eat slowly"" ""Eat local and fresh"" ""Make your own meals""If you're lacking any cultural lenses through which to view your food and want to try the French way, this would be the place to start"
4,French Women Don't Get Fat is a Recipe for Success,"French Women Don't Get Fat truly is a guide to healthy living and eating. The writing is easy to understand, and the vignettes make for interesting reading. Some readers may find Guiliano's criticism of American eating habits off-putting, but they are interesting insights nonetheless. As with every great artist, Guiliano doesn't reveal all of her tricks, but she still writes a very enjoyable book."
5,French Women Don't Get Fat,Beautifully written in a personal way. This is not a diet book. This is a book about how to really enjoy life. Wonderful recipes too!
4,The Secret's Out: Eat Sensibly!,"Mireille doesn't tell us anything we don't already know; but she tells us how to eat for pleasure sans a formal diet, which most women cannot follow, anyway, which is why we are fat in America. Her eating tips and recipes are great. Since reading her book I have lost 15 pounds and it shows! No diet but lots of exercise (walking) and eating for pleasure. Read this and discover the secret for yourself!"
2,A nutshell,"This book is not worth the money. Here's the bulk of it in a nutshell. Walk everyday. Short walks, long walks, stairs...whatever, just move. Secondly, make what you eat count. Do not eat mindlessly or too much. Eat what you want, only until you are full. And eat fresh. Do not eat processed, packaged food. There, that's it. Obviously if you do these things, you will lose weight. You don't need to pay $20 to have a French woman tell you how bad the American diet is."
3,French Women Don't Have Groundbreaking Tips,"I'm not sure I needed to read this book. Not because I disagree with Mireille Guilliano and all the women of France, but because I felt like I already knew everything in this book already (except for the leek soup, which sounds delicious but not like something I'd like to eat more than one meal in a row). Maybe that's the point of this book - that the best ""diet"" isn't really a diet, but is a lifestyle change that makes you more aware of the choices that you make and ensures that you make the right ones. An interesting read, but nothing groundbreaking."
4,Clever book to help people get over dieting,"I love the message of this book...Stop focusing so much on how bad food is and eat small portions of what you enjoy. If you are into food you will love this book because inherently you already know what a joy dining can be. It is great to see in print what most of the world thinks every day. Eating is suppossed to be an expereince, not a way to pass time while watching TV. This book is a fun, easy read that most people will really enjoy. You will feel free to enjoy your favorite chocolate and wine while you read!"
4,It's not a DIET book. It's a lifestyle book,"I am half way through the book. I bought it because I work with a French female. She eats and eats and hardly gains a pound. And when she feels like she has, she drinks tea. When I told her that I wanted to lose weight, she said two things to me.1- Water2- Lay off the junk, especially pizza.lol.It's been a year, and I am down from pushing a 14 to an 8, pushing a 6!But this book really isn't about losing weight. It's about Americans and our relationship with food vs the French culture and theirs. I bought the book because I was interested in learning more.Don't buy this if you're interested in a get thin quick fix. Buy this if you're interested in getting some insight on what YOUR relationship with food is and what you can do to alter it.My next goal - more veggies. Yuck! lol."
5,Great book,"Man Tombakk, how many times are you going to cut and paste the same review? The common ideas in both books are:1. eating only fresh ingredients, drinking a lot of water2. enjoying the process of eating, chewing well, celebrating each meal3. eating all kind of foods, not following any fad diets4. eating a lot of vegetables and fruits5. using your muscles, exercising6. focusing on pleasure of foods and life in general7. changing your diet according to the season8. eating in small potions, not overindulging ...The list goes on. Most importantly: LOVING YOUR MEALS WHILE USING COMMON SENSE AT THE SAME TIME. I like ""French Women..."" for the pleasure of reading but I respect this book for its great ideas"
4,Eating in a new light,"This book has a lot of the same information that we've all been told a million times: eat less, enjoy your food more, etc; however, this book manages to to get that point across in a new way. It makes eating and enjoying food an obvious outcome, and is supported by anecdotes of the author's struggle with her weight. This is a book I will refer back to a lot to keep myself motivated."
4,French Woman Don't get fat good but slightly unrealistic for Americans,"I believe that the book brought up some good points such as:portion control, focus on what your eating,and enjoy food don't make it an enemy. The book brought to light that Americans obsession with dieting is making them fat! I did like the idea of enjoying chocolate and wine in small doses( good quality chocolate), I suprised myself when I bought some good quality chocolate squares(small)one or two was enough when I concentrated on what I was eating(serving size was 4 small pieces). However I do not think it is realistic to do all the cooking that the book recommends. French woman take a 3 hour lunch and come home from work at a resonable hour, unfortunately that is not the case in America. Although Mireille does work in the America part of the time she is a CEO, and has more freedom with her schedule then most Americans.Overall the book had some good tricks to help Americans change their attitude toward food."
3,French women have common sense,"There's nothing revolutionary about this book. Author Mireille Guiliano, who was born and raised in France and now lives in the United States, describes how she overcame weight gain as a teenager and now abides by the tried and true weight control methods of French women in order to stay slim and healthy while still enjoying the foods she loves. Most of this book is all common sense: eat smaller portions, walk more, etc. Still, while all the info in the book is pretty generic, it's obvious that many American women do not abide by it, as more than half of us are obese. The book has some good suggestions and offers a variety of simple French recipes to try. Women who need to lose more than 30 pounds and who don't have a lot of time to cook for themselves may be better off reading a different healthy lifestyle book, however."
4,mireille guiliano,"while I found mireille somewhat of an aristocrat with her opinions of french women(I have learned that most french women are actually not so picky),i did find this book quite informative on how to eat healthy & moderately! I have used this method for about one month now & have lost 3 pounds. I am now wearing clothes that were in my closet that i could not wear because i was too flabby. I now eat yogurt, cheese, bread & drink a glass of wine daily. I'm 45 yrs old & I'm wearing my slim jeans again!!! This isn't a diet & it works!!"
5,Great Book - Great vendor,"Hi,This is a great book with insights and recipes. It really helps one understand the difference in lifestyles and diet between the French and most North Americans. I was particularly impressed with the service from the vendor. I will post those comments separately"
1,So...what is new here?,"I am not at all one to bash an author or her books, so this is not my intention. I am just giving another view here. What was all the hype? I'll bet there aren't more than a handful of folks who don't know everything that is in this book, having heard it all of our dieting lives. To me, the highlights of this book were: drink more water and walk walk walk. That is it. We KNOW that.However, the author's own story is interesting in itself. I would have waited for the paperback to read that though."
4,Just Plain Common Sense!,"This is one best new ""non-diet"" books of the season. I reffer to it as a non-diet because that's really what the focus of the book is - using plain old common sense to stay healthy! Eat fresh healthy foods, stay away from processed foods and focus on quality, not quantity. Lead an active lifestyle - take the stairs, and walk, walk, walk!Of course, there's loads more to the book, but I found it to be a breath of fresh air, similar in this respect to another new non-diet book I just read, The Ultimate Sex Diet, also a great read. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I can't admit that the French might do anything better than us."
1,Tries to deny what it really is: a diet book,"The author preached in the first 30 pages of the book that this book was not a diet book...then a few pages later completely contradicts herself! Alot of commonsense--portion control. I thought the French knew something Americans didn't! Oh, please. Save your money and do what I did: read it in your local library and save yourself the change. Don't give this lady any more money to buy croissants."
1,California Women Don't Get Fat,"It makes about as much sense to make such a statement as it does to make the statement that French women don't. As a matter of fact, women from both places do. We are only talking about percentages here. I think it's about 10 or 11 % of the French population versus maybe 20 to 25 % of the California population.Let's talk about those percentages that aren't fat.As a male, let me tell you that the I much prefer a slim, fit, vibrant woman like so many Californians than a thin, wan, pouty, ""sophisticated"" French woman.Advice to American women (and men). Eat less, excercise more, don't smoke, don't drink to excess. Find plain, good quality food and don't waste your time obsessing over food as do many of the French.And don't fool yourself into thinking that the French have answers that you don't."
1,Pre-natal care in France makes the difference,There has been more than 100 years of solid pre-natal care in France. This makes all the difference to the growing fetus whether it is programmed with thrifty genes or not. Read about intergenerational medicine and you will understand it has very little to do with what the author proposes but that pregnant French mothers ate high quality food that impacted the way the baby to be born will interact with its environment - namely the food s/he will eat. NOT about breathing deeply before you eat your food....
2,Not as inspiring as expected,This was a disappointing purchase. I think the philosophy can bet summarized in less pages than this book.
2,Pretentious to the extreme,"This woman makes me laugh. She really doesn't know what she's talking about and is continually putting down American women. It's not a 'diet' book, it's a book that allows her to tell us all about why we are so fat. What a ridiculous book. I can't believe I actually paid money for this crap."
1,Earthshattering!,"Another breakthrough diet book that's sure to have every woman in America slim, trim, and beautiful.It contains ground-breaking concepts like -Eat lessExercise moreIt's heartening to see that another person has taken advantage of Americans and their never-ending search for an easy answer."
1,wrong book,"Once again, the specific book I ordered was NOT sent. I ordered French Women Don't Get Fat, 2005, 2007, paperback, and I received French Women Don't Get Fat, 2005, hardback, which does not contain the ending recipes of 2005, 2007 or the final section, which I found very useful.I got this book out of the library and had read the first 3 chapters when I decided to own a copy so I could mark it up. I hate marking up hardbound copies.This book is wonderful for me as it implies an entire change of attitude with respect to eating. This won't happen in a day, one reading, but needs months so I plan to xerox the pages I want from the library and savor this book, but I do wish it were paperback."
1,diet,Receipes weren't what I would eat. Too much daily shopping for fresh food. Who wants to make their own yogurt?? A few bites of each plate in a restaurant seems like a lot of waste. Will stay my 20 pounds over and just cut down on intake.
2,same old diet,"French Women Don't get Fat is just the same as every other weight loss book... cut down on carbs, watch portions, etc... The authors story of herself was interesting, but just the same diet that so many have already sold us."
3,smoking needs to be discussed,"I have been very curious about a factor of American/European life: One of the things that has radically changed in America since the 60's is the number of people who no longer smoke. Everyone I know who quit smoking got heavier - forever. Europeans (and Asians) smoke much more than Americans now. Is it a factor in their staying slimmer, just as it was a factor in my own weight and those of most of my friends? After we quit smoking, we were all at least a little heavier. It is no more reasonable to dismiss this factor than any other."
2,Bit of a dry read,Nice sized book but difficult to get into as the author uses a lot of European terms and slang that Americans don't know or use and it's difficult and dry reading. She does offer some interesting recipes but I'd never do a leek soup regime for a week or even a few days to kick-start my weight loss. I regret buying it.
1,Really???,"I can't believe so many American women pay money for this book and then give it a good review! The author has quite an attitude with a healthy distain for common American women. And an unrealistic idea of the situations common women face- such as being unable to bicycle to the farmers market every other day for fresh produce. Anyway, it's the cabbage soup diet (aka leek), champagne and no nasty low class Hershey chocolate. One bite of dessert and then push it away! Sigh. I'd feel sorry for her- it started when she gained some weight and people noticed and commented. Clearly she's very hurt by it. Except- she has no problem passing on the negative energy, and collecting the money."
2,But French women DO get fat!,"I live in France and although in Paris - as in New York - you see very few fat women, outside the big cities we are seeing more and more fat women and men. In her book she makes a very condescending remark about the immigrant women not knowing how to eat correctly like the French and they are the ones who are becoming fat - this is simply not true. In France, as in the U.S., the rapid changes in lifestyle - women working outside the home, less physical exercise, convenience foods - have meant people gaining weight. Wealthier women DO have diet doctors who they DO see regularly, I find that they are obsessed with not getting fat - one reason so many of them still smoke. There is some good general advice in the book but just too much glorifying of the French for me - and it is very much NOT about the typical French woman."
3,The book is full of great tips BUT...,"I lived in Paris for a year and French women don't get fat because they smoke a lot cigarettes. They are obseesed with being thin (they think you are fat if you are a size 38 which is an American size 8) and there are no shortages of diet stores in Paris. They don't eat much. In fact, they eat very little when they are alone, but in front of people they will eat a ton (its opposite of women in the US). Typically a french women will eat a piece of chocolate, coffee or espresso, and a cigarette for breakfast, they eat a small sandwich (panini or such) with a cigarette for lunch, an apple and a cigarette for a snack and a salad a peice of protien and maybe a very small desert/or coffee/espresso for dinner--followed by of course a cigarette. Lets not forget all the cigarette breaks throughout the day which will supress your appitite."
1,French woman Pulling a Ruse!,This book was altogether the same old same old! Miss Frenchie in her condescending tone tells all us American couch potatoes to eat less and exercise more! Sucre Bleu!! That's as old as the Marie Antoinette attitude the author puts forth! She also goes on to mention that French women will order an expensive and decadent chocolate dessert only to take one bite and push it away! Oh how daaaaaaaahrling! Pretentious a bit? She also drinks champagne at every meal. She deos not mention the packs of cigarettes that French women go through each day to keep their weight down and their moods sour! This book was a waste of my money but illuminating as far as what French women think of us American fatties and how far we have to go to liking the French and their superior tone.Don't bother buying this.... go the Weight Watchers website and get the same advice!
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I had read the suggestions by ""KatieK"" and so went to the local store and purchased this book: I had read ""The Bamboo Chest"" and thought that this book would deliver the same clarity and brilliance. Boy, did I get a wooden penny!Save your money: unless you enjoy eating only leek soup on weekends! Eating Pleasure??? The fact that she walked all over the place is the real non-secret: exercise! We are an active species that has through technology found ways to remove that activity. . .and we've paid for it with obesity and heart disease."
3,Don't know,I bought this as a gift for someone who wanted it - can't comment any further and wish you would take less words!
3,fool proof advice,"This is a great little book, very conversational and not at all like a diet book. She basically is just telling you common sense eat less and exercise more and cut out excess sugar where possible. She gives you easy recipes that sound good. She also gives you great advice on how to relax, because I do not how to do that."
5,Very healthy,"French Women Don't Get Fat is a revealing book about the French food culture. Like Simply Delicious, Tasty and Exotic Foods, The usurper and Others, The fat Fallacy, one gets to know of the variety of healthy diets around."
3,Anyone who eats fast food should read this book,"I love the authors (European) ideology, in reference to her approach to food & wine. Americans are so consumed with `dieting' and `fast' that we never take the time to appreciate GOOD food. I don't even think most of us know what good food even is anymore. We don't linger over our meals for hours and we certainly feel we've done something immoral when we `indulge'. The problem is we indulge in all the wrong stuff. This book is great for urging people to get out & find farmers markets, local fish mongers & real butchers and enjoy the calories they're consuming on REAL food. I gave up McDonalds years ago... this book urged me to gourmet shops to buy tasty cheese & local honey. SO much yummier & as we all already know, it's a matter of moderation - do read this book & stop wasting your calories on SnackWells & other stuff that the dog probably shouldn't be eating!!"
3,French Women Walk A Lot.,"I bought this as a gift for my friend, and I looked through it before I gave it to her. Truthfully? I was all ready to be cynical, and dismiss this book as unrealistic. Instead, I tried out a few of her ideas, like stopping rich desserts after a couple of bites, and walking places within reason. The result is that I'm enjoying my food more, and, yes, slimming down."
5,Well worth your time.....,"Lee Mellott (Frederick, Maryland) and Russ (British Columbia) and others have such great reviews it is hard to improve on what they have said. So I will simply share that the book for me is more about teaching American women how to change their mind set. The author really does stress that one is what and how much they eat, as well as what they think, speak, read, wear. She reminds me a great deal of how the late actress Audrey Hepburn lived and thought. And it is true French women as well as many European women walk more, eat less and overall are committed to not being super women but being healthy, whole and happy women. Am also reminded of the late Julia Child who never had a weight problem, who in numerous interviews stressed the value of whole foods like butter, cream, etc in moderation and not the 'low fat' foods that actually encourage a person to eat more since they see 'low' and think they can then eat more."
1,The French have nothing,"They dont have as an abundance as the US and so we over do things. After living there for 7 years and learning gastronomical reasons for some of France's favorite foods id say stick to American eating its alot healthier and better for you. I seriously resnt the French ""Holier than though"" attitude that stems from nothing, the author should get more medical facts less snobbery."
2,Disappointing,"French women do get fat and smoke. I have many friends from France and they tell me that it is a weight obsessed country but many women there are getting fatter, and starvation and smoking is their real secret. I thought this book would give me the answer to losing the weight I needed to. It is just common sense, eat natural foods, smaller portions, and move. I didn't finish it because I found it boring and lost the 200 pounds my way. Another thing, America is so different from France. What may work there might not work here."
2,WOMEN ARE WOMEN.,"I gave it 2 stars : One star for the author's upbeat tone and the other for the author's sharing of amusing personal experiences. Overall this read more like an autobiography of the author's obsessive relationship with food. It is curious however that she has chosen to write an entire book advocating strict dieting, portion control, and a frequent intake of a ""cleansing"" soup that would barely keep a Chihuahua alive, and throughout it maintain that Americans are overweight because they are the ones who do not relax and enjoy their food! Give me a break.Women are women - some are fat and some are thin. I remind the author that McDonald's is just as popular in her homeland as in ours. In my opinion, foreign nationality is not a proper credential for dispensing sound advice on nutrition. This is a very serious topic that should be directed by medical/science professionals -not champagne merchants."
2,Take it with a pinch of salt,"I know a good number of women born and raised in France and they are all heavy. Women in all countries come in all sahpes and sizes. This book is for fun, not reality. Read it, but don't take it seriously."
3,Not really worth it,OK if you just want to pass the time but basically it's just another book of the same things we've all heard before.
1,Useless,"This book is useless. Common sense, moderation, and not eating junk food is the quick summary of this book. If those things are something new to you then I would recommend that you read this book. For the 99.9% of the rest of us that have ever been on a diet--there is nothing new here. In addition, this book is annoying and condescending. For example, the author recommends that each meal is to be eaten on fine china and enjoyed slowly. Are you kidding? I don't know many Americansthat have that luxury. The tips and recommendations in this book are (for the most part)unrealistic in this country. We have a completely different society. It is rushed. We work long hours. We are over-booked and exhausted. I wish that we weren't. But to overhaul our society in order to lose a few pounds is a tall order. I don't think I'm up to it. I'm tired."
2,well.....,cook more - eat varied - eat lessI lived in Switzerland for 16 years and in Europe you shop everyday for what you are going to eat that night. THAT is civilized! But not possible in the USA.
2,French women don't get fat except the ones who do.,"French women don't get fat except the ones who do.Profound insights.-Et s'il vous plait plus recipes des frutes de mar, Madame du Vin de Champagne.And Mrs. Champagne, why not more seafood recipes?"
1,Worst book I have read in the last year -and I read 2 a week,"The first third of the book was tolerable. The rest of the book was horrible.....The author continues to find everything wrong with american food. Nothing in the US is fresh enough...suggests that she buys hazelnuts from another state and oranges from Florida...who has the time or the money be be shipping in foods...some of the pieces of advice are good, but how many times can you hear about the horrible tomatoes the US has? Book could have literally been 5 pages long...my advice, skip the book, save the money and just use your common sense."
2,Go to France,It basically says that French women don't get fat because the French have an entirely different lifestyle and attitude towards food. It was interesting but not particularly helpful as key elements are not readily duplicated if you don't live in France.
3,Don't bother with this book,"I read this book after talking with my sister who had been in france and noticed there were few 'fat' french women. I was disappointed with the book. I wasn't expecting a miracle 'cure' but basically it outlines the same old thing we have heard over and over. Moderation, small servings, chew slowly, lots of fruit and vegetables. Also do more activity. I did find it odd that she did not recommend the gym stating it was essentially a waste of time and energy and would burn you out before old age.I also found it tedious and obnoxious the way she would throw in little french terms and phrases in almost every paragraph. I took french for four years at school but can't remember much of it and when I buy a book in English, I expect it to be written in English. I found that extremely annoying and distracting. My advice, use your common sense about food and exercise and save your money for something else!"
5,Great book!,"I had so many books on ""French Woman secrets"" in my cart, but I choose to purchase this one mostly because of the reviews. Not only is the author entertaining but very informative. She also includes facts to support her chapters. There is even a chapter with recipes. I am so glad I choose to purchase this book over the others in my cart. I definitely recommend this book and will keep it for a long time as I am sure I will re-open it for recipe ideas!Shipping was on time, Amazon is getting better with shipping."
5,Great Read,"Wonderful book. It's a very quick, fun, light read. It was interesting to learn how French women view food. Highly recommend."
2,Guiliano is a typical French snob.,"I'm not as impressed by the French as Guiliano would like me to be. They are people just like we Americans. But Guiliano is quick and steady to point out how everything is ""better, fresher, and higher in quality"" over there in France.Granted, their food is good, and she does have a point when she tells us that it is best to limit your portions and not be overtaken by indulgences not worth the trouble. But, to constantly demean Americans claiming we are all fast-food, ignorant eaters is just plain wrong. There are countless quality chefs, markets (with beautiful varieties of mushrooms, tomatoes, and other fresh items she implies are impossible to acquire here), and food-conscious people in the States.She first needs to stop focusing on her superiority and then continue with her sound advice."
1,Obvious,"Um, isn't it obvious, they all smoke like chimneys! In all honesty, I lived with a French woman and I'll tell you how she stayed thin, 1 hour a day at the gym and she considered a ""meal"" one laughing cow cheese slice.Not rocket science, they just don't eat much at all!"
3,A factor not discussed: Smoking!,"I have been very curious about a factor of American/European life: One of the things that has radically changed in America since the 60's is the number of people who no longer smoke. Everyone I know who quit smoking got heavier - forever. Europeans (and Asians) smoke much more than Americans now. Is it a factor in their staying slimmer, just as it was a factor in my own weight and those of most of my friends? After we quit smoking, we were all at least a little heavier. It is no more reasonable to dismiss this factor than any other."
1,French Diet a Smoke Screen?,30.8% of French women smoke. Almost half of the French women between the ages of 18 and 24 are smokers. Tobacco is an appetite suppressant and cigarette smoking helps women remain thin.
1,French women don't get fat?,"A. They smokeB. They obcess about their weightC. They do get fat, but like their American counterparts they are ashamed of it and so you won't see them sitting about fashionable outdoor cafes, but if you spend some time at the grocer...Hopefully we won't see this nonsense turn into a series.French Women' Don't Get WrinklesFrench Women Don't SweatFrench Women Don't Need Sleep"
1,The REAL reason they're thin....,French women smoke (as do most European women).THAT'S why they're thin.Don't waste your money.
4,Glimpse lifestyle of french women.,"Easy & fun to read.Good way to glimpse lifestyle and way of thinking of french women.It's easy to keep you in good shape, if you change your lifestyle and mind.This book tells you how to change these. It's like grandma's pearls of wisdom. (It's not magical but philosophical. )Once it becomes habit, it's easy and simple. (like Zen)thank you."
4,Not Rocket Science,"I have to say I was a bit sceptical about this book after all the negative reviews I had read, but I did enjoy it. I could do without the excessive French phrases, but the premise is sound: don't eat from a package, the word diet is not a verb, and bodies are meant to move. Yes, the American way of life is different than the French (the author DOES say there are fat French women,too.) The point is that you don't have to be overweight because you live here, make some minor changes for a lasting result. I don't plan on trying to find a farmer's market in New England in winter, but buy seasonally and use common sense! It should be of no surprise to anyone with a tv or who reads or goes to the mall that we are a country of fatties. Don't throw up your hands and give up! I very rarely eat from a package, get takeout, or eat out and I have two children under five and work fulltime. My point is that if something is important enough to you, you MAKE the time."
3,Good,This book is very good as it is NOT a diet book. It deals with the most important part of any person trying to loose weight - the head!If you do not change your way of thinking you will loose weight but will gain it back. The book teaches you to change your way of thinking about food so the weight loss can last for a life time.
4,Fear the leek soup,"This is a fun little book, though I don't know anyone who has lost weight after reading it.I just wanted to mention one thing. Not only does her ""miracle"" leek soup taste bad, it gave me an astounding set of digestive problems, starting on one end with the worst heartburn of my life, and finishing at the other in a horrid way best left undescribed. In retrospect, this is not surprising - onion-type vegetables are incredibly acidic, and I can't be the only one whose stomach rebels when fed nothing but.Her second soup, the vegetable melange is actually very good, particularly after a few days."
5,MNReview,Super to have the author read the book (loved her accent). Sounded like a friend talking to you.
5,Fresh air in a book,"This book is about learning how to live to the fullest. All things in moderation, less stress and more variety, and, most of all, finding joy in all things. Inspiration is on every page, and I find myself happier each time I've read a chapter."
5,French Women Don't Get Fat,The title of this book intrigued me and I'm so glad I bought it. The author has such practical approach to weight management and delicious recipes that I'm enjoying using. The thing that's different about her approach is learning how to enjoy food without guilt. I would highly recommend her book to anyone that's looking for a revolutionary method of weight management.
1,Fluff,"You are far better off reading any books by French nutritionist Michel Montignac (Suzanne Somers based her Somersizing books on his plan). Montignac's ideas work, and he explains why, w/o bashing Americans."
2,Boring,"This is a rehash of every diet you've ever tried. Don't bother. This book may be helpful if you're 5 lbs more than you think you should weigh, but not for those of us who weigh more than 20 lbs over the weight we'd like to be. The only good thing the author says is to lose the guilt about the food you eat. That mind set is probably the chief reason many of us are overweight."
3,"look at me, i'm a genius","1) eat slowly2) eat a wider variety of foods3) enjoy the meal without looking at your watch4) never eat fast food5) don't overindulge, but don't overdeny6) eat fresh, unprocessed food7) burn your television8) walk outsidethere, i saved you $13."
4,Good BOOK for many reasons!!!,"A. You can NOT take such a serious yet emotionally tough thing too seriously as it will drive you crazy!!!B. This book is for those that need/want to loose 10-20lbs. tops- not people that really need drastic HELP!C. If you are like myself and just want to loose 10-20 pounds and learn to eat better and watch your weight then this book if 4 u!D. It is fun, cute and cool yet serious at times and helpful!E.ENJOY FOOD and focus on what you like most and learn to eat well and enjoy your food but not over-endulge!****I give this book 4 almost 5 stars and highly recommend it to people that want to try and loose a few pounds yet also learn to portion control and make good chioces! Since reading it- I feel more aware of what goes into my mouth but not obsessed and crazy and I also have lost a few pounds and I just finished reading it and have not tottally applied it to my life 100% yet but am starting too! Good Luck and Good reading! Knowledgable and FUN book! Thanks!"
4,You can learn,"I enjoyed reading this book, but I didn't like the constant French words in between the English words. I found it distracting at times. I also felt that this book was written more for people that have money than for the average person. I did learn the value of drinking water and wine. I also learned that the French look at food and drinking entirely different than Americans. I plan on using some of the author's advice and putting it to everyday pratical use."
3,Portion control,"The author has some great points, but this is simply a tale of practicing portion control, and not snacking. I lived in Europe for a year and ate butter and bread everyday, BUT I also walked daily, did not snack, and junk food and microwave dinners were absent from my diet. Another fact is that lunch is the big meal in France and most of Europe (they close down for 2 hours for lunch!) and dinner is actually light, which may have alot to do it. Even so, it's worth the effort to try and adopt their principles."
4,Worth the Read: Apples Just As Good As Oranges,"This is the second book I've read by this author. 'Strange Doings' is definitely different than Gracely's first book (Giant Rat of Sumatra), but still worth the read. I have to pretty much agree with everything said by the reviewer from Philadelphia who likewise rates this 4 stars. Let me just add that although this who-dun-it has, in fact, a relationship between morality and art, not everyone with blood on their hands turns out to be a Modernist. On a different note, it's nice to see this author branching out a bit: this story appears to be 2 to 3 times longer than his first book, and certainly strikes a contrast in content."
1,not impressed.,I was not impressed with this product and neither was my jeweler. It taught me a lesson about buying jewelery online. I ended up having to melt down a bracelet to fill in the inside of the ring because the interior was hollow and scraped my husband's finger.
1,Doesn't work!,"I bought this for my son and we got it home and it would only work in the demo mode. we kept trying to switch it to the regular mode and nothing would happen. We even tried new batteries...nothing!So, we took it back to exchange thinking we just got a dud. So, I decided to try out the new one before I left because I did not want to have to come back. Good thing I did! That one will not work in the regular mode either. The walmart customer service lady helped me try 3 and the same problem with all of them. Maybe I was doing something wrong? Well, if it is that hard for a 30 year old to figure out then how can my 3 year old? This product sucked :( Bummer too because my son loves his Mickey Playhouse."
4,Tamrac camera bag,Kodak Easyshare Z812IS 8.2MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized ZoomThis Tamrac camera bag is a nice fit for my Kodak EasyShare Camera. The camera fits in snug and has an external zip pocket for memory cards and extra batteries. We recently used this camera bag for our camera on vacation and it worked out fine for carrying the essentials on our journey. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their camera well protected and handy over the shoulder for easy access for those pictures you don't want to miss.
4,outstanding,cobham meets bellson is just what every begining drummer should own -- the results of cobham and bellson true drummers that brought the level of playing to the next level
3,good value,I would suggest this item for light workIt looks bigger in the picture than it is in real life (isn't that always the case).
2,Nostalgia Popcorn popper,"I was disappointed in the popper. First off they use platic panels not glass for the popping machine, easily scratched and stained. The cart is ok made of tin, but you can see where they painted over rust spots, should only be a matter of time before rust eats its way through. The worst part though is the actual popping bowl itself, The auto stirring wand binds up when the corn starts popping, it appears the motor isn't strong enough to push through the popped corn and expell it from the bowl. When I pop the corn I must stand there and watch for the stirer to bind up turn off the machine dump the popped corn restart and continue until all corn is popped. What a Hassle!!"
1,DINKY CHILD'S TOY - DO NOT BUY,"Full-sized popper?? This popper looks way smaller in person than it does in the pictures. The wheels are tiny and the accessories are cheaply made. It's not even gold or brass plated, it's actually spray-painted gold...When I finally got around to making popcorn, it popped sooo slow and left almost half the kernels unpopped. I will be returning this one and buying a different brand that doesn't look like it was made for kids."
1,"Just a toy, It would take all day to fill the hopper. Cute","If you want a item just to look at, its great, It would take all day to fill the hopper, and there is no heater in the bottom so the popcorn is cold as soon as it comes out. This is a conversation piece, not a usefull product other than 2-3 very small bags at a time. Full time job keeping any popcorn made. Want popcorn to eat, go the store and buy a tub already made. You could buy a lot for $200."
4,Nostalgia Electrics CCP509 Full-Size Popper,"We really like our popper...except A LOT of kernals do not get cooked and are spit out because both sides of the stainless steel pop open up when popcorn is cooking. We used the best popcorn, Orville Redenbocker, and almost 40% fo the kernals did not pop. Other than this problem, we like the machine."
4,Nostalgia Electric Corn Popper,"I bought this corn popper to put in the waiting room of my barber shop, and make free popcorn available to my waiting customers. It does a very good job of popping the corn. The only two complaints I have with it are:1. The stirring mechanism stops sometimes, and I have to dump some of the popping corn out of the pan, then it starts again. It doesn't do this very often, but I still have to watch it pretty close when the corn is popping.2. And this is my biggest complaint, the lids that lift up when the corn is coming out, will stay up and not come down quite often, letting some of the unpopped kernals come out. When this happens, I have to open the door and push the lids back down.I wouldn't let these two problems keep me from buying the popper, because it still does a good job."
2,Popper WONT Pop,"At first this product was awesome! It makes great popcorn. However, after about 40 kettles of popping, the popcorn stopped poping out of the popper, and would sit in the kettle and burn. The manual has no help on how to solve the problem. I took the top off the machine and could not see any obvious issues.Its very frustrating. Since it was under 90 days, we will be able to get a replacment from the store, and we have a long term warranty. Something tells me we will need it, because the motor and gears seem very indequate for a small family that pops 20 kettles a week for parties and sleep overs.I haven't made contact with the company yet, if it is possable, but I will be researching a bettering gearing replacement option. I have read many posts similar to mine, and this company must do a recall, or they will be out of business.Best wishes to all you Poppers."
4,Awesome! with a small reservation,I LOVE this popcorn machine. First of all....its so cute! And you HAVE to get the pemixed packs because regular popcorn just doesn't pop as well and burns and is tasteless. It tastes just like the movies! The only drawback I find is that the heat lamp pretty much sucks. YOu have to eat the popcorn fresh or else it gets stale right away. The light is not all that all and cannot reach all the way to the bottom of the case well at ALL. I wonder if its a fire hazard to stick in a hotter bulb. Hmmmm. But this is a wonderful addition to any house with kids. You cannot get this taste with microwave popcorn!
2,Works just OK-Price is right,"Bought this for our TV room. It works just OK because the kettle continuosly ""pops"" off the gear that stirs the popcorn. You need to sit there and hold it in place. I have a feeling its not going to stand the test of time! Other than that little glitch it makes good popcorn"
5,Diamond in the rough....,"A few days ago, I skipped classes at the University to watch my favorite band, Built to Spill, in Minneapolis. The concert was amazing. BTS closed the show with Freebird(Great song in the first place, and I've seen the song performed live by Skynard, but Dug and the boys did it justice).But the icing on the cake, was their opener, The Delusions. I've never even heard of this band before, and from the time they walked onto the stage until they left, I was enthralled. I haven't been moved like music like this for at least 10 years. It was beautiful, captivating, and powerful. That Flower Song was among my favorites.I highly encourage anyone who likes any type of rock music to go check these guys out. Have I the opportunity again, I will definitely do the same. I can't wait until their CD arrives in the mail...."
1,Waste of Money!,"Do not buy this waffle maker, it's not worth the 10 bucks! I bought mine (craving waffles) on sale, and it's still not worth the money.The waffles come out soggy & they never seem totally cooked (no matter how long they're in the maker).I'd suggest spending more money on a nicer waffle maker, otherwise you'll start thinking (like us) that waffles aren't that good. :-\ But, they are!Good Luck!"
3,Okay for the price,"I got this waffle maker on sale. It's very quick and easy to use, but the browning is a little uneven and tends to produce waffles that are darker in the middle. You can't beat the price though, and the waffles still taste good even if the aesthetics are a little off."
4,Great value for a waffle maker,"I bought this waffle maker after reading about it in a cookbook. The cookbook said that one of the major cooking magazines had tested waffle irons and that this inexpensive Toastmaster model had come out in the top of the list. So I bought it and used the recipe from the cookbook, and I had GREAT waffles!! The first time I made a waffle it stuck to the iron a bit, but I just used some cooking spray and all the rest of the waffles came right off. They were cripsy in the right places and soft in the inside. Yum!"
3,"It explains sola fide well, but sola fide is false.","If you are a Catholic or Protestant, you should read it for to understand the Protestant view on the issue, not that Sproul speaks for all. I'm Catholic, and I'm glad I read it, but I disagree. Sprould often comes across as a bigot who will force sola fide to fit Scripture despite the scriptural evidence against sola fide. Near the beginning of the book, he even paints St. Augustine as having been wrong about some point!!! An open-minded reader familiar with Scripture will probably find other areas where Sproul's theology just doesn't quite fit. Still, I say read it since he presents the Protestant case about as well as it can be presented. When you finish, read ""Not By Faith Alone"" by Bob Sungenis to get the other side. Then, make a choice."
1,Makes for a good challenge,"This issue has been the center of much discussion for hundreds of years. Let's remember that faith without works is dead, being alone(Apostle James chapter 2). God justifies the sinner and saves him by faith but the faith should be evidenced in works."
5,What Incredible photography!!!!!!!,"This book is amazing.......It starts out focusing on surfers......then windsurfers.........then mixes in great aerial shots of all over Maui.For windsurfers (like myself) it's great to see good shots of the world's best......on both windsurfers and on surfboards. Robby, Kalama, Bjorn, Sierra, Alex etc......on both types of boards.And like I said .....the scenic shots of Maui are great too......Check it out..........This is a truly incredible book........It'll really get your adreneline pumping!!!!!!!!Hang Loose!!!!!!!"
2,Before Wagner,"This mind-numbingly dull and wholly uninspired opera tells us again just how revolutionary Wagner was. The production is quite mediocre; the lead singer especially needs some vocal coaching. The costumes are dull. Above all, the music lacks any sort of spark. It just goes on and on and on."
1,i just dont get it...,what are those people saying... honestly what language are they speaking... the music is ok i guess... but without understandable lyrics its all just meaningless... no A for effort here...
4,A Good Book,"I found this book to be a good book, very informative. the research was well done, (there where diary entries by Drake and others through out the entire book). the only thing I found they was not to my liking the whey the anther used fifteen century spelling in the chapter titles and the diary entries, as for the latter I can under stand and I probably would have done the same. In the chapter titles although it was not to my liking, it wasn't that big a deal. all in all it was a good book and very fair when it came to less presentable part's about Drakes life."
2,Not well written,Such potential for a great story but too much what they said in their own words and not enough about the historical facts.I needed to know the names and places of today's maps.
1,the transfer is so bad that i really can't say if the movie is good,the transfer is so bad that i can't tell if the movie is good or not!!!! not a good buy!
2,"Mediocre plot, no battle scenes, not a ""war"" film.","This is basically a film about a love triangle taking place in a setting among amazingly noble Philippine guerillas in World War II. The love triangle consists of a very young Filipino woman, a American man in his 20s and a middle-aged dirty old American man. The old man is a double-dealer and a serious jerk. The issues of self-preservation and loyalty emerge quickly. There is the predictable fight over the girl, the young man eventually kills the nasty old man and it's never clear if the girl cares about anyone. The movie is badly misnamed. Very few military ""battle"" scenes involving more than a few people occur.If you're looking for an authentic WWII military film this is not it. The acting is fair (Van Heflin plays the old man very effectively), scenery is good (the sets are well done and they spend a lot of time walking around outdoors) but the movie drags on and never gets past the interpersonal drama among the three principals."
2,Very Disappointed,"I read ""Math Curse"" and thought this book would be just as good, but I was sadly mistaken. The illustrations are great- which is what drew me to the story. However, the ""poems"" are very hard to get through. The authors chose poems from long ago that are probably not familiar to most people and thus hard to relate to. Also, the description of this book says for grades 1-3, which is impossible. None of these topics are covered in science at these grades- since students are just starting to learn how to experience science and classroom science is very basic in grades 1-3. So with that in mind the book was kind of pointless for me to get to read to my 3rd grade classroom since they won't understand any of the scientific words or get any of the. ""science humor"". I, as an adult, found this book humorous- but that's not the point of the book."
2,disappointed,"I did not enjoy this book at all. I didn't think the verses were witty or interesting, and I was hoping it would actually have some helpful information in it. I teach science and I'm always looking for clever ways to help students learn material. This was not helpful."
3,Science Fun For Adults,"As an adult, I got a kick out of this book. It is funny and whimsical. I like it. However, the children were bored. Not only did they have no clue what it was about, but it was too wordy for their liking. The pictures are fun, but not enough to hold their attention while reading the poems. I was also less than appreciative of the evolution and big bang stuff that found its way between these pages. I think it could have been a fun and educational book, but it is lacking, for kids, in both of those areas. However, it would be a great gift for an adult science nerd!"
2,It seems so boring to me... to see science used as poetry,"As a sequel to Math Curse, you'd probably think Science Verse would be equally as good. Actually it's a disgrace! Firstly, ""the poetry of science""! COME ON! Science and poetry have NOTHING in common. Secondly, stupid ryhmes such as ""Jack jump over the CO2 + hydrogen et cetra et cetra"" and ""the dinosaurs were destroyed by teachers"" is neither scientific nor interesting. Thirdly, there are no brainteasers like in Math Curse. Just dull ryhmes that have no beat or tune- just rhyming! If you're looking for real sequal to Math Curse, this is nowhere close."
4,Fun book for elementary kids who like science,"My 9-year-old has been quoting from this book since we got it months ago. I don't particularly care for the verse about dinosaurs, but most of the rhymes are cute, and they do impart information to those of us who were science-challenged in school.It's a good book to transition kids from the generalities of early elementary school to more serious science."
2,1st published rough draft in history of publishing?,"This story needs massive amounts of editing for basics like plot continuity, characterization,dialogue, etc. You name it -- it needs fixin'. Take it off the market, fix it up -- clarify the premise; make the characters and plot believable; construct some form of internal logic for the plot and for the heroine's propensity for cursing a blue streak. Then, and only then, put it back on the market. It has the potential to be an exciting story, but it's still too raw, too amateurish. In spite of the weakness of this story, I will probably look into other works by this author."
2,too much of a good thing..,"Although this was a erotic book, this was too much of a good thing. Some of it was over kill. This was my first erotia, but I felt it could have been better written. Sorry"
2,Ellora's Cave is failing me,"There are too many books from this publisher which are simply unreadable. Tainted Purity reads like a first draft and we need at least 3 more to go. It was so badly written it kept jerking me out of the world of the book, to start rearrange sentences, fix grammatical errors, delete repetitions. It got so distracting, that I stopped reading. Sigh.Underneath all the errors and weirdness there was some semblance of a story but not enough to hold me through the badly written dross.This goes back to the reswap pile. I couldn't even finish it. :("
4,very pretty,A little flimsy but they are very pretty. I've hesitated to wear them too often because I don't want to have to replace them too soon.
5,Anklet ruffle socks,These are super cute and very comfortable. The lace isn't cheap looking and the fit is good. Great for pageant queen Halloween costumes!
2,Decent at that,"It is good to see Brett Hoffman back in the band, however this is not a masterpiece by no means. The music is half-hearted and the lyrics are as well. If you want the all time greatest Malevolent album GET ""RETROBUTION"" NOW!!!!!!! Also, what's with this ""Death Metal Ballad?? Acoustic guitars and death metal vocals DO NOT go well together. Then there is a track with keyboards on it. What the f#$%? If you are indeed a fan of this band do not get your hopes up before listening to this CD, I sure was disapointed. Thumbs down."
1,Don't waste your money,I received this vacuum from a gift book with multiple gift choices. I am extremely disappointed. It doesn't have any suction on my carpet - won't even pick up little light fuzzies (like from the carpet or from socks). Buy another vacuum.
1,Terrible,"don't buy this vaccuum. Its horrible, it doesn't do a good job vaccumming I am furstrated becasue this has no suction and the hose broker off when i was trying to use the on board tools!"
5,Very inspiring,This collection of prayers is beautiful and very inspiring for anyone interested in mission anywhere in the world.
3,Swing n' Jive talkin' - Jersey style,"JERSEY BOUNCE is a St. Clair brand budget label CD that has everything you've come to expect from such lower priced collections: modest playing length, no liner notes or song details, fair-to-middlin' sound quality and a mix of original and latter-day stereo sides. The material itself is THE redeeming quality here-- for fans of this genre, it's a certainty that you won't be disappointed with the music on this album.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 28:34"
5,Jesse Bear What Will You Wear?,Excellent little story for toddlers and pre-schoolers. All three of my children love it and want to hear it again and again. The illustrations are also engaging for them as well.
5,Excellent book!,"This is the perfect toddler book. I got it from the library for a homeschool lesson, and my daughter loved it so much I'm going to buy our own copy. The images are colorful and soft, with lots to look at. The story (or poetry) is very simple and short. I like how, even though the story centers around baby Jesse and his mom, the dad is involved also. The story is very warm, with obvious affection shown for Jesse by his parents."
2,"Cute Rhymes, Politically Incorrect Illustrations","The rhymes in this book are catchy and my baby likes them, but the illustrations show Mama bear staying home and taking care of Jesse Bear all day. Papa Bear's participation consists of coming home from work, reading a newspaper and giving a good night hug while Mama Bear supervises. Poor Papa Bear isn't a great role model...."
3,Needs updating,"We got this book from the library, and my daughter (18 mo) loves it because it is relevant -- getting dressed, eating, washing hands, playing, getting ready for bed, etc. And the rhymes are nice. BUT give me a break! The mamma bear in an apron, the daddy coming home and reading his newspaper!? Please. This is 2004, not 1954. There is no reason that a book like this has to teach stereotypes. This is disappointing, because otherwise I would be happy to have this on my daughter's bookshelf. In short, buyers beware."
5,Granddaughter LOVES this book!,"After reading other reviews of this book I bought it for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter. She loves it! She takes it to bed with her and puts it under her pillow for naps and bedtime. After only reading it to her a few times I've heard her ""reading"" to herself practically word for word the lines from Jesse Bear, What Will You Wear?It's one of her favorite books and I have to say I'm impressed."
1,Jesse Bear. What will you wear?,IT KEEPS A CHILD'S INTEREST AND HAS FUN ILLUSTRATIONS..I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. MY LITTLE GRANDSON LIKES TO HAVE IT READ OVER AND OVER TO HIM.
5,Easy-to-take form of Calcium Citrate (no more choking on horse pills!),"LifeTime's Liquid Calcium Magnesium Citrate is in a very-easy-to take form, and it comes with magnesium and Vitamin D 3 for better assimilation. I've tried most of the flavors (Orange-Vanilla, Lemon, Strawberry, and Mixed Berry) at first mixing in juice, but recently found they taste good on their own--similar to a flavored liquid yogurt. If you have difficulty swallowing big tablets or can't handle dairy products, this supplement may be just what you need."
1,Cal/Mag,1 drop caused diarrhea and extreme headache.It switched my constipation to diarrhea.I had insomnia. The CAl/MAG caused me to get extremely drowsy which did cause me to sleep.But the side affects were far more than I could tolerate.Especially the headache down the right side of my face.
1,How to not conquer calculus,"I checked this book out hoping to ""conquer calculus"" (i.e. pass 2nd and 3rd semester college calculus) and all I got was a lousy book full of lots of letters, and very few numbers and equations. I guess that's what you get from a math book written by a lawyer"
3,A lifesaver for those who take themselves too seriously......,"Just don't make the mistake of buying this book or letting the title fool you. The only thing you'll be conquering is the tendency to take yourself too seriously when doing mathematics of any type. It'll be lurking somewhere at the local public library or hiding amongst a stack of dusty, serious math textbooks in the science/tech section. I couldn't keep myself from laughing for a good 3 hours, which is about how long it should take you to finish reading it. They should have a different version of this book for every math level from calculus on up to loosen up all those math students who study as if they're perpetually in the first year of law school. The jokes are by no means ""Seinfeld"" quality, but you'll crack here and there for sure."
5,A favorite!,"My 13 month old son LOVES this book. He ""reads"" it every chance he gets and loves flipping through the pages to point at the different pictures (which are so funny and clever). He asks us to read this book before naps and bedtime constantly. Our family loves Duck in the Truck!"
2,Bad Ending,The ending was awful. I thought the duck was a bad example and treated those who served him very poorly. I wouldn't read it to my kids.
5,Wonderful book.,Cute story and great illustrations. The story is quite entertaining especially for toddlers. This book is worth buying.
1,Where was the editor?,"The ending of this book completely kills it. We received it as a gift. I read it to my daughter and now we are going to get rid of it. The reviewers who say the duck is clearly portrayed as an antihero are mad. You may pick up on this - and help your kids interpret the ducks behavior, but even at 18 months, my daughter is more than capable of pulling books down on her own and looking through them without me standing over her shoulder as interpreter. The message in this book is poor. Trick people into helping you and then leave them in the lurch when you get what you want.The sad part is that they could have fixed it pretty easily at the end. If only a second tragedy befell the duck - kind of as karma come back around. Then the message would be bad things happen to bad people."
2,Disappointing Duck,I love Jez Alborough and this book is great to look at and read and rhyme with -- until you get to the end! Shame on you duck. I read this to a group of children at a day care center yesterday and they were shocked at Duck's treatment of his helpful friends.
3,One of my toddler's favorites... disappointed in the ending,"Unfortunately I'm not all that thrilled with how the story ends, but up until the very end it teaches helpfullness, problem-solving, etc. I really think it's a great teaching tool in that respect - I just hate that I have to lecture at the end on duck should've been kinder to his friends. They rhyming is great and really engages my preschooler. Would love the book more if it had a more positive outcome. We are huge Jez Alborough fans and this book will stay in our library."
1,No moral value,"I agree with the ""bad manners"" review. My 22 month old son really likes the pictures, but I make up the story as I go, because the one in the book would only teach him to be rude and use other people without ever thinking about their needs. The duck gets ""stuck in the muck"", and enlists several other animals to help him. Once the truck is out of the muck, the duck simply drives off, leaving his helpers ""stuck in the muck"", without any ""thank you"", or help to get out. I hope the author of this book isn't driving in my neighborhood!"
2,Duck's Truck is Yuck!,"The Duck in the truck story does suck,I liked Hug and Bear but with duck, was out of luck,Bear's scare and tales lead to careHug's mugs are cute as a bug.Leave duck's truck in the muck"
3,Timer,"Decent little timer. The back pops off and battery pop out after being dropped on the floor but, it always goes back together and works. Guess it would be five star if it stayed together and still worked after being dropped."
4,Like the battery,It uses AAA and I do rechargeable so prefer it over watch battery types. If use low self discharge type like Eneloop it lasts forever. Little fragile if dropped tho usually survives. Dropping often partially mutes the speaker. Would like to find a timer with neck lanyard that avoids watch battery if anyone can tell me. Also one where you can reverse minutes without clearing would be great.
2,Pleasant but completely vacuous,"The author comes across as a nice lady who couldn't stomach the dogma of her Southern Baptist upbringing anymore. So far, so good. But the new metaphysics that she has put in place of her old ones have little or no substance. She believes in some kind of generic ""God"", yet has no ideas on what attributes this ""God"" has. Sorry, but an ineffable God is about as useful as a non existent one. The author does not believe in the traditional concepts of heaven and hell, yet believes in the existence of some kind of ""soul"" which may go to some kind of heaven or hell, but she's not sure what form those may take either.In short this book comes across as well intentioned but totally unfocused ramblings by someone who cannot cut all of her previous ties to religion."
1,Wrong map,The description said 50 mile radius map of Raleigh. The image showed a 50 mile radius map of Raleigh. I received a map of Richmond.
2,No Label - No Wake Bouy,"I even asked a person that works for Amazon, if this Bouy had the label attached. I was informed that the label was attached to this product, and I was purchasing the exactly product shown. But unfortunately, when the product arrived and my home, it had no label attached or even in the package so that I could attached myself, but it did provide instructions on how to attach the label which would be helpful, if there was a label to attach.Note to any other buyers, you are buying a plain white bouy marker with NO LABEL. You will have to purchase seperately."
5,Extremely relevant,"I read this book now more than a decade ago. But as I consider the damage just sustained along the New Jersey coast and in the city of New York by hurricane Sandy, this book has constantly been on my mind. An armored coast, essentially without natural defenses, was tested by a major storm, and the results are appalling. Now, predictably, the newspapers are full of stories suggesting the solution to the problems experienced in the Northeast? More armoring of the coast!Thankfully there are a few exceptions, and the discussion of using the natural habitat of the coast as a way to mitigate the impacts of storms is seriously on the table in places. But the fact that I have perspective and understanding on this issue I attribute to this book which made a truly lasting impression."
5,Mandatory Reading,"This book is mandatory reading for anyone living in a coastal community. Well written and well researched, it is helping our Beach and Dune Committtee understand what options to consider. Thank you very much for an interesting and informative book."
2,Interesting but unfair,"Extremely biased toward a non-property owner viewpoint. Although the government is spending money to keep sand and retain structures, it is also acting in the interest of public safety. Also, many government agencies are limiting what property owners can do with their own money, on their own property, to save their investments. Both sides of the argument are not presented evenly."
3,not worth 153.99,"go to your local tower records store and you'll see this selling for 19.99, a much better deal than the 153.99 listed here. sure some of the tracks are EXCELLENT but, wouldn't you rather pay about 30 bucks for a 2cd set that is all mixed? well this set isn't, which makes it all the more unappealing. however, if you do find this at tower for 19.99 then i suggest buying it. it does have some pretty good tracks on there but i can't remember which out of the 50 are the ones worth listening to."
1,Weak,"THe Knights of Cawdor is about a rag tag group of misfits who are forced out of the Granite City.In their wandering they come across an abandoned castle that is inhabited by evil creature that are capable of taking a person's body. Apparently the evil creatures were created by the dark lord Krulashards (I know I misspelled his name) from the previous books. But the dark lord forgot about the creatures, thus they were not used in the previous books. I was thinking no way does a master of dark power forget about creatures he created. Second creatures capable of taking over humans are not original.Unfortunately, none of the main characters from the previous books make an appearance.And this book will leave you hanging. Make sure you've gathered the next sequals before taking this book on. The ending will leave you hanging.Dan ShafferFairfax, VA USA|"
4,An engaging work of fantasy,"Great book! Mike Jefferies does a wonderful job of drawing the reader into his story. The storyline is fast and engaging, and the characters are well developed. While not on the scale of Tolkein or Tad Williams, readers who enjoy Mercedes Lackey, Gayle Greeno, Robin McKinley and the like will probably enjoy this book."
1,Yuck,Don't buy this CD. I cannot believe that Amazon allowed such poorly produced and performed music to be sold on their site. The singer is bland and talentless. No more need be said.
3,"Decent, but not great","Ordered this a little while ago, it showed up very quickly.The grip itself is ok, the square block at the top isn't very ergonomic, and is rather painful if you have a heavy gun.I used it on my AK-47 for an airsoft mil-sim, then used it on my M249 SAW for the next game. Sadly, the bipod portion snapped right off when I went prone to provide cover fire for my squad.All in all, it's not a terrible grip, but for the money, I would go for something else."
2,Broke first time out,"This was one of the first mods i bought for my new woods ball marker. And the concept is great. Works as advertised, the bipod is spring loaded, and easily tucked back in to move position on the field. My first time playing with it was about 5 hours of close quarters woods ball play. And unfortunately, this grip was not up to speed. Upon getting home to clean my marker, i noticed that the plastic piece that holds the grip to the gun had a small crack, upon removing the screw, it had indeed cracked all the way through. This happend over a month after i bought it so i could not return it to see if there was a problem with the one I bought originally. if you plan on just using it for looks, then this will work fine, however from my experience, its not up to real play if you plan on being just a little hard on it. Not combat ready, more of a toy, in my opinion."
3,Am I missing something?,"So, I purchased this for use w/ my Hi Point 995 TS. I also purchased a Red Dot, both of which are supposed to fit my rails. Now, the red dot went on without a problem... however this grip can't even latch on properly. I love the grip, how it extends out into the bi-pod, etc.... however it can't latch to the rail which completely takes away from the point of purchasing the product.I did notify the seller and am waiting to find out what can be done. I would love to use this, however seeing as though it doesn't fit a standard rail (properly), I can't recommend it for other Hi Point 995 owners.I will admit though, it came earlier than expected and had a note about the seller being a small business. I am VERY happy with that part of my order. I always like to purchase from a small company when given the opportunity. Good company to work with thus far... looking forward to resolution so I can get this mounted."
4,Works for real AR-15 guns,I bought the Bipod for my AR-15 gun because the good ones cost a lot more. Its good enough for a gun but the stand moves a little the good ones ma be better. But all in allits a good bye and should work.
4,Best Grip for Price,"This grip comes with a bipod which is a huge plus, but the only reasons i didnt give the product 5 stars because the bottom of the bipod does not have rubber ends, making it slip real easy on any surface you cant get a grip on. But other then that the bipod is great for the price. GAME ON!"
1,bad,"this thing is simply trash, its way to big, and its super cheap, i wouldent even put it on a nerf gunsave your money and buy a nice real metal bipod grip"
2,Needs another piece,I did not know you needed another piece to hook up this one. It would have been helpful to know.
1,Not for real world use,"This bipod is designed exactly like the style issued by the U.S. Army, but with inferior materials or an inferior inside design. I had this for approximately 4 months and used it moderately. The internal spring kept jamming and would not let me push the legs back in unless I had the perfect angle. Eventually, the spring would no longer let me push the legs back in at all. If you want a personal bipod to use on a real M16/M4 or AR15, spend a little more money and find one of better quality. This may work on a paintball gun or an air soft gun but cannot handle the weight and abuse of real world operations with a fully weighted rifle."
1,CHEAP CRAP,stay away from this it is worthless it broke the first time i used it if you are going to use it on an airsoft gun it might be ok but if you are going to use it an a real gun it is worthless
1,Most of them don't work,Most of the items do not work.Have tried to contact the vendor.Still waiting...
3,Toy grip and bipod for toy guns,"I bought a bipod at the gun show for $15 and liked it so much, I wish I had bought more. Then I saw this online and thought they must be similar, right...NOT.This is a very cheap knock-off of a cheap knock-off. But it was less than $10 and it sourced from a toy store so I should have known better.I't would probably work just fine with toy guns so you guys might call it a 5-star product.It just wasn't what I was looking for. It has quite a bit of wobble where the legs connect to the body."
2,Poor quality bipod,This bipod was attached to a airsoft AK47 but broke after first week of use. Would have been better if made of metal.
5,fantastic,the bi-bod is from plastic .. but it is not cheap at all ... very sturdy and very useful ... very very handy item for many guns out there
4,tactical grip and bipod,"Searched several options for my s&w M&p 1522. Went with the cheapest, worked out great. Quick delivery, perfect quality for what it is. Foregrip is tight w/ good grip. Spring loaded bipod engages perfectly and only has a little give when in use. You really have to slam it back up into place to close. Also, I cut and glued some rubber grip pads to bottom of feet, but still secure without them. Got it for $8 when similar are selling for much much more. Hot import toys and hit toys rock!"
4,A real surprise,Wow! A product that exceeded my expectations. I purchased this item in spite of some of the reviews. The price was right and the application (my son's S&W M&P 15-22) was a step up from the typical paint ball use. The push button activation of the bi-pod worked well and the legs retracted easily. He did not like the use of a grip until he tried it. Now it is a permanent fixture. The grip/bi-pod may not work well in combat but for bench/ground target shooting you cannot go wrong.
1,Bad Bipod/Foregrip,"This was not a great item. I got htis a couple of days afetr I ordered it and I was super excited. I probably popped it out three times to show my family then the fourth time it popped my rail for it right off!! I was pretty dissapointed. My advice, if your are going to buy one, save your money for a high quality one. This was not a good buy for me. Luckly it was cheap:)"
4,pretty cool,awesome as a vertical grip. i popped out the bipod and its not the strongest thing to hold your gun up with still its awesome it bends the legs when your trying to turn the gun to the left or right to shoot someone but anyways awesome grip and bipod for $8.00
4,ok,"Its not as solid as I would like, but it does say its for an airsoft gun. Have it on my m4, nice for plinkin around with on the wekends."
5,Grip and Bipod,This little nugget was a great investment for the money. It does away with having to add a grip and a bipod. the cost is well worth it and it works fine on my 10-22 conversion. Amazon was a great help.
3,Bipod/tripod forgripe,"Umm the forgripes ok, I mounted this on my AMD AK-47 (NOT AIR SOFT.Seems pretty slippery and my hand seems to slide right to the top of the grip.The bipod seems kinda week like it will give out after some continues use.Its worth the $17 but you could always invest in something with more quality!"
1,junk,"junk junk junk. the bipod wont stay in once u try to re-insert it. i have messaged with the company and they told me to tighten up the grip, yeah did that. it did nothing..... not happy at all. would like money back or a replacement"
2,low priced for a reason.,PProduct was very poor quality. legs will not stay inside unit. very flimsy. The price fit the product quality but was hoping I was getting lucky.
4,Good Add on,Worked well with my mossberg 715T. got into the prone position and went to town at a target 150 to 175yrds away. held up nice.would be a 5 but have to slam the feet back up to make it latch. by the way at gun shows they want 30 to 40 dollars for the same item. so you can put this on an AR15 it will handle the weight.
3,Nice Combo Grip for AR-15...But it's still just a toy,"Put this on my S&W; M&P; Sport AR-15. This review is before I've shot with it...but will update my review once some rounds are thrown downrange. I figured, it was cheap and if I break it, I can give it to my nephews to throw on their airsoft guns to mak'em look cool.Pros: Price is very nice. Very solid when attached to rail. No wobble at all. Bipod shoots out quickly. Grip seems solid enough to use during live-fire and will probably last lnonger than the bipod itself.Cons: Bipod feels a little wobbly when extended. Bipod shoots out fast, but because of the toy-like quality I need to brace the speed with my hand to ensure I dont break the damn thing. I dont see this lasting that long.Overall: Looks good for the price, very solid grip that may last through some shootings. The bipod itself feels cheap and does not seem like a good choice for live-fire."
4,Save some $,"The tactical for-grip and bipod combination is wonderful. This is my second rifle I am using this on. My 223 Saiga has had this model on for about 2 years and works great! I purchased this one to replace one that I had on my 7.62x39. The first one broke at the legs. I rate this as a 4 because of; 1) the first one failed on the larger caliber. 2) the new one has legs that are holding, but at times seem a little week. However, I can buy a bucket load of these for the price that most bipods/ for-grips are selling."
1,crappy,horrible bipod and grip legs broke within first hour befor that it stop deploying crappy abs plastic not worth your money
4,Great product,Not much to say besides its a great product for the price. Very stable and fits perfectly.Only thing worth noting is that the tripod springs are very strong and it does make a noise when deployed if you don't control it. ;)
4,Better than expected.,"Though this is sold as an Airsoft product, I have it on my AR-15 and it works just fine. I've only had it a couple of weeks, so I can't speak to it's longevity or durability just yet. So far so good. It is very comfortable, and feels much more sturdy than I thought that it would be. I really only needed a forward grip that was more comfortable than the aluminum rails and I felt the bi-pod would be good for sighting in. It has exceeded my expectations for quality and speed of shipping. It arrived within three days while the tracking numbers still had it three more days out."
1,I ordered this item but I didn't get what I ordered.,"I just received this in the mail today and I did not receive a grip with a bipod. All I received was a folding forward grip. I wanted this item to keep watch so I can move fast and if I have to hold my sights on one position I could do so with the built in bipod. Unfortunately, I did not receive this item I only received a folding grip. I gave this one star because I don't know what the grip + bipod looks like, feels like, etc. Very disappointed."
5,Great,"This is a hell of a lot more sturdy than I thought it would be, given some of the other reviews on here. Can't beat the price. For those of you considering putting this on something with more kick than a paintball/airsoft gun, go for it. That's what I bought it for and I have no complaints."
4,Great grip,"This is a great grip and with you can also use it as Bipod,the price is good but the quality is ok as it's all plactic but not bad quality , i like it. You get more then you pay .Thease grip sold in store for around $25."
4,Great buy,"I wanted a grip like this since a hunter I know showed me the one he used. This is a cheaper make, obviously, but it's sturdy and will take a good beating. It's heavy-duty plastic, so it's pretty light, but it has a good solid feel in your hand. The springs that unload the bipod can stick a little, and so can the latch, so don't be afraid to get rough with it a little. Trust me, it can take some slamming around. Great value, and a marked difference in accuracy at longer ranges too. If your looking for a grip and bipod package, this is perfect for any Paintball marker with the rails to hold it!"
5,nice!!!,"excellent product, very helpful. and has a very good price, I recommend to everyone here to use in my m4 and yes I have great! is also useful in SCAR and DMR rifles."
4,Great product!!,"Great product, 2 for 1! Appears to be durable thus far...Its just a bit hard to snap the bi-pod back in... Its not a big issue.. I Recommend it....Plus its very cheap.."
5,"So far so good, well worth the price.","So far it seems real nice, I am surprised as to how it feels, I figured really cheap but it seems like it could be tough enough to stand some abuse. I could see it breaking after some heavy use and there is a big difference between this and a $50 one, however based on price, this is well worth it."
2,"Great grip, BAD bipod.","well, i really liked my grip it arrived quite early and looked great on my m4, but after a few times popping out the bipod one leg completely snapped off. The plastic is cheap so make sure you just don't keep popping out the bipod or just dont use it at all...But the grip is perfect! it is a little thicker but it makes my m4 feel more ""chunky""...so the $15 is worth the grip but if your going to get it as a bipod, make sure you look at your other options."
5,Grid and talent,"A book about Wim Crouwel's fonts and typographic posters/cards. All text in his own Gridnik typeface. His typefaces are constructed on very logic and rational grounds but still have a strong personality and human dimension, they are more than just experimental. It would certainly be nice to see more about his work. (There are some interesting interviews with Wim Crouwel on You tube)Wim Crouwel - Alphabets"
3,OK sight,Got this sight for an airsoft gun.For the price it is functional for what I got it for.The adjustment is a little quirky but it does the job.It flickers on and off at times but I think the battery contacts are just a little loose.I believe I got that fixed tho.
3,could be better,i like this product the crosshairs line up great but it is to low for my c16 raider if you buy i would suggest also buying a rail raiser
4,Great deal,This item arrived promptly and was shipped in a professional manner. The items works as described. The lens are clear and the red cross is bright.
1,BEWARE,"This is a total piece of JUNK. It is 25 mil plastic, crosshairs are canted off 15 degrees, adjusters are free-wheeling with no detents, and it belongs on a 5 yearold's ""sparkler"" type gun IF even there. IF I don't get a full refund on this I am going to be one angry buyer. Is this really the BEST this seller can do??? The whole world watches !!! :("
5,"Morning Tea, part 2",My wife and I have been drinking this tea for years. IT is truly the best tea bag found and the prices here are extraordinary. I couldn't recommend it more.
5,The best Assam in a bag,This is my all time favorite Assam tea (other than the kind I can find in London) and it seems to be hard to find in the stores. I am a very serious tea drinker and I love being able to buy it in bulk like this. Excellent find.
5,Just the thing for lovers of bold black tea,This is excellent Assam tea. It brews a deep red-brown liquor with the proper strong malty aroma and taste; a perfect afternoon pick-me-up when I need to get through the rest of the work day.
1,I WON'T EVEN USE IT!,"I got this coffee pot on a great deal during the ""Day After Thanksgiving Day Sale"". My previous pot had broken, and I just needed coffee, nothing fancy. When I got home I took it out of the box, everything looked fine, but the stupid ""easy swing"" basket did NOT easily swing. The basket had to be forced open, and then forced shut again. Deciding I was NOT going to put up with this every morning, (cause it would probably break in a week) I returned it."
2,Basket Difficult,I found the filter basket difficult to open and close as well.I need to purchase another filter.
5,Morning Musume 3rd Love Paradise,"Well, what can I say about Morning Musume? This CD is one of those Cd's you can listen to over and over again and never get tired of it. Two of Morning Musume's biggest hits are on this CD; Love Machine and Koi No Dance Site. Both those songs are awesome, and then there are other songs like 'Why' that are also really cool. This is a must buy CD."
4,Kawaii ne??,"morning musume is such a cute little...well...big ^_^;;; group! my favorite members are mari yaguchi, tsuji nozomi, and ai kago!! but i like minimoni better than morning musume (minimoni is made up of 3 members from morning musume, the ones i named, and this other girl from hawaii). my favorite song from this cd ish prolly....dance suru noda. very cute ne? i'll prolly buy it...when i get more cash....ja!^_^;;"
3,I love the songs but..,"it's really a nice album.I mean, one of the cutest and the best songs are in the 3rd one.However, like most of the songs are the singles that came out already.I mean, I know you put in single songs in the album,but there are like 2 or 3 new songs in the album.HELLO THEN WHAT'S THE POINT OF MAKING AN ALBUM??of course, it might be cheaper to buy that way..but I WANT NEW SONGS!!MORNING MUSUME'S GOIN' DOWN THESE DAYS AHH!"
3,"Good book, but not if you're learning by yourself","I am learning Swedish by myself with Rosetta Stone.I bought this book to get an overview of the Swedhish grammer.The book is ok but it's not meant for people who learn by themselves. There aren't enough examples and no exercises, so you can't know if you understnad or not.The good thing is that is summarizes everything in one small book, so it can be a reference to someone who just needs a reminder or a quick explanation."
2,It worked great until....,"I got this case, and it worked great until it broke. Maybe I got a defective one. There was a lot of pressure on the clasp, and a few weeks after I bought it (too late to return it), it was sitting on my desk and the clasp just shattered. It had not been mishandled or dropped, so there's a flaw, even if it's ""just"" the thickness of the foam."
3,Good case but easily scratched or cracked.,"I really like this case. It is well designed with solid rubber around the perimeter and back of the case. The rubber clearly was made to provide shock-absorbing impact protection to the iPod. The front of the case is made out of relatively thick clear plastic and has a cutout for the click wheel. There is a detachable belt clip on the back that holds the iPod horizontally on your belt. I thought I had finally found the perfect case. However, with my first day of use I was disappointed to discover that the front clear plastic part can be easily scratched or cracked. When I went past a bookcase, I accidently bumped the case against the bookcase. It seemed like nothing serious until I removed the iPod from my belt. The plastic front of the case had a deep crack in it. It is still usable but not very attractive anymore. Too bad, this case really had promise. If only the front plastic had a little more give to it."
2,Not strong enough,"I thought this product was great when I was buying it. After one month clasp broke, and i'm out $35 and bursted open therefore dropping my ipod while i was walking. Not very happy right now"
4,Beautiful case,"This case is very nice, in design and function. The only reason that I give it four stars instead of five is that it adds quite a bit of thickness to a 20gb Ipod, because the other 4th generation Ipods are thicker. The foam pad insert works well, and it's die cut to the back of the case, so you can't see it through the back of the case. It strikes me as rather strange that the instructions for opening the case are inside the closed case when you buy it, though."
1,not a lot of new information,"Beyond diet is nothing but explaining to you the common sense approach to diet and exercise. I was bored with the diet I was on, and ordered this one to give me a jump start, only to find out that I already knew most of the information I was given. If you do not have much information already on diet, exercise, and balance of foods, then yes, there is much you can glean from this diet program. But don't bother with the newsletters... The regular, e-mail 'newsletter' is nothing but hype - EVERY one of the messages touts a product that you just HAVE to have to complete your goal or pursue a specific problem. Go to the library...it's cheaper."
2,An Outdated book - very disappointed,This book is from 1980s and is out of date. I was disappointed in as things have changed since it was written.
3,Outdated,I wished I had not ordered this book. I thought it was a newer version. This book has small print and isn't an easy to read book. Too technical. The book was published in 1984.
1,not very helpful,"This is the author's experience with dealing with endometriosis. Not alot of back up or reason behind the suggestions. Many of her suggestions are excellent for promoting good health, but it's not made clear why they help with endo."
5,at last - a book that shows you the light,"Highly recommended.I was almost in tears when I found this book - everything this woman writes is something I can relate to or have had direct experience with.Each section of the book is wonderfully comprehensive, as is the research.I urge all of you who are suffering with this disease or if you know someone struggling with it, to read this book - you will treasure it.It has completely changed my life and I am positive it will dramatically alter how you cope and manage your life.Thank you so much Tammy!"
1,This is still for sale?!,"I was actually searching for a new air popper when this one came up in the search results, I cannot believe that this thing is still for sale. I bought it a week ago at Target and it's been a complete headache. I was going to pitch it but after reading all the other bad reviews I'm going to return it and get my money back. This is a bad product.The heated kernels that get spit out with the popcorn often explode in the bowl and fly around the room, quite dangerous actually, if a little entertaining the first time. I've tried tilting and shaking the popper, and covering the bowl with a towel, even if this stops the flying kernels it doesn't solve the issue of less than half of them popping.Don't buy."
1,Unuseful and frustrating. A total waste.,"Pops about 1/3 of the kernels and spits the rest all over the kitchen--and they're hot too, so watch out. The top is designed poorly so only about half of the popcorn makes it into the bowl. The rest is with the hot kernels all over the kitchen. I feel guilty giving this to Salvation Army, no one should have to put up with this piece of junk. I wonder if the manufacturer tested any before shipping them out. Reminds me of the Cornballer."
1,Complete Disappointment,"I bought this to replace the faithful Wearever Popcorn Pumper that I took to college in 1982, that finally died last week. The new popper is a complete waste of money. It pops maybe half the kernels, blowing the rest out unpopped along with the popped ones. The butter melter is inconvenient, and the components get very hot.I'm sure there's a better popper out there - I know 25 years ago there was! I'm going shopping again. Don't waste your time and money like I did!"
1,File this popper under G - for garbage,"this is the worst popper i have ever had in my life , i do not recomend this unit to anybody"
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"This is a piece of junk. I bought it at Target, it was the only one they were carrying. It only pops half the kernals and dumbs the rest on your floor. Stay away from this product!"
1,Terrible product,I bought this machine at Target after I moved and had thrown out my grungy old one. I wish I'd have kept the old one. This thing is junk! Half the kernels don't pop and they fly all over the kitchen or stay in the bottom of the bowl for you to break your tooth on. My old machine would make a giant size bowl of popcorn in a couple of minutes but the Chefmate turns itself off after making about two cups because it is over heated. It takes about 15 minutes before it will turn back on again so to make a big bowl of popcorn would take about an hour. I wish I kept my old machine.
1,DANGEROUS!,I purchased this under the brand name CHEFMATE from Target. It only worked the first time and it started working fine - popping and landing in the bowl. As it increased in heat it increased in popping and it blew very hot kernels all over the place! I grabbed a towel to aim them in to the bowl but the top gets so hot it isn't safe to hold your hand or a towel that close to it. I have filed an incident report with Target and am returning this one as defective. I would strongly advice against purchasing this product.
1,A useless hazard,"I bought this product at Target two days ago, under a different brand name, and I was very excited to use it! I tried it out as soon as I got home, only to horribly disappointed. Easily half of the unpopped kernels flew out of the unit as it was working, flinging stinging-hot kernels all over the kitchen. I ate the tiny bit of popcorn that did pop and land in the bowl, mulling over this failure. Surely, I thought, I must be doing it wrong. I tried again immediately. Once again, I found myself being chased out of my own kitchen by hot kernels flying everywhere.Needless to say, I returned this useless piece of crap. Do not buy this unless you want to be blinded or as a gift for someone you hate."
1,Awful,I only gave it one star because there isn't a category with negative numbers. This popcorn popper is the worst I have ever had. Like someone else mentioned I used it 3 times and threw it away. I thought I was doing something wrong when UNPOPPED kernels started flying all over my kitchen. They explode into the bowl causing the small amount of popped corn to fly as well. But I was not doing anything wrong the product is just bad. Please save your money. I bought mine at Target as well under the name Toastmaster but it seems to have other names as well. BEWARE. I almost got hit in the eye with flying kernels.
1,A Dangerous Dud,"I, too, just got this (today, actually) from Target (under the Chefmate label, but same product). Very dangerous as, even warmed up, I was shocked at how many hot, unpopped kernals fly out as the other kernals are popping and then these super heated duds explode in the bowl or wherever they happen to land (which is everywhere). A little too much excitment for me over a simple bowl of popcorn. Plus, about a third to one-half of the kernals never popped, so it's really wasteful, too. I'm taking it back tomorrow."
1,Do not buy this product,Horrible machine. The top easily slides off and if it is popping at the time you have a volcano on your hands. I had the exact same problems of others with superheated popcorn kernels flying all over the kitchen. Having a bowl under it does not guarantee the popcorn will go into the bowl. How could they put such a product on the market?
1,Worst consumer product I have ever bought,"Bought under the ""chefmate"" name, but identical product. It's unstable. Overheats. Seems to be a device designed to spew superheated unpopped kernels all over my kitchen. What kernels do pop are small. Seriously, in order to make a full bowl of popcorn, I have to load the kernels, then run the popper. 2/3 of the kernels fly unpopped into the bowl or ricochet out into the room. Superheated kernels fly into the bowl like grenades with the pins pulled and explode, blowing popcorn everywhere. I shake the bowl to get the hundreds of unpopped kernels down to the bottom. Then I scrape off the popped kernels and pour the unpopped back into the machine. Run it again. Repeat literally three more times before the original kernels are 75% popped, at which point I give up. The machine sits in the middle of a circle of unpopped nibs and popped corn all over my floor and countertop.A piece of [...]. Just don't do it."
1,Save your money,"this product is terrible, I bought mine at Target too. It is loud and only pops half the kernels while spitting out lots of unpopped kernels into the bowl which then start to pop in the bowl because of the heat and popcorn goes flying all over the place.Pros; The kids get a kick out of the flying popcorn and the dog gets a tasty snack by eating the popcorn off the floor!"
1,Wish I had seen the reviews before I bought this popper,"I have had air poppers since they came out and loved them. This one is awful. The corn doesn't pop well and comes out tough. I have tired putting in less corn, shaking it, etc. and no better. Unfortunately most stores in my area tell me poppers are seasonal products for Christmas. When someone offered me an old one they didn't use anymore, I jumped at it and my family is very happy with it."
1,Junk!,"This has to be the worst hot air popper on the market. The popcorn does not pop well & what does pop, comes out tough. I thought there couldn't be much difference in air poppers - WRONG! Popcorn flying all over the kitchen, machine overheated/sparking! I used the Toastmaster 3 times & threw it in the trash. I didn't want to give this to Goodwill - afraid someone might burn their house down or worse. Then bought the Presto (which I had owned previously but dropped on the ground & broke). The Presto pops so much better. Spend the extra few dollars & get a decent machine."
1,"Dangerous, do not use!!","Like other posts stated, please save your money and do not buy this product. I purchased this product brand new from a garage sale for $5. At least I only lost 5 bucks. This thing shoots hot kernels across our kitchen. The kernels actually explode in mid air or in the bowl causing the popcorn in the bowl to shoot out. I've already gotten burnt by one of the hot kernels. This thing should be taken off the market. If i could give it a 0 star review i would. But seeing as i can't it gets a 1 star."
1,Waste of time and money,"I couldn't find the Presto 04820 ""Poplite"" Hot Air Corn Popper when my old one finally died after 15 years of faithful service, so I picked up this model. It's bad. The machine doesn't pop the corn quickly and when it finally does, it doesn't blow the popped corn out into the bowl. Don't waste you time or money--this model disappoints."
2,Not worth the money,This machine shoots out lots of unpopped kernals. I have to sort thru the finished product to find the fully popped corn before eating. Spend a few more dollars to get one that works better.
1,Warning-Dangerous popper,"I bought this popcorn popper as a Chefmate at Target. I've tried different types of popcorn, small kernals, normal large size kernals--this popper SUCKS! It is not designed properly. No matter what size of popcorn I use, and, carefully following the directions that came with the popper to a tee, once the corn starts to pop, most of the corn remains unpopped and flies out of the mouth of the popper, fast and hot. For the 1/2 cup of unpopped corn put into the machine, about a third will pop and flow into the bowl, the other 2/3rds either flies out all over the kitchens or jumps unpopped into the bowl. A waste of money. Unfortunately, I tossed the receipt, so I am just going to have to toss this popper in the trash and go buy a Presto."
1,Yes -- it is THAT bad,"If you want this machine for its intended purpose -- popping pop corn, stay away. I went to replace our faithful Hamilton Beach machine after it died after 10 years and this was the only air popper for sale at Target. A good air popper gets nearly 100% of the kernels popped and they end up in the bowl. My kitchen is now a disaster area, kernels everywhere and only about 1/3 of them popped. I thought it might be defective, but from the other reviews here, it is behaving normally. It is going back today."
2,Catch the Corn Game!,"Who likes this the best? My dog, of course...the popcorn shoots all over the place as it comes out of the machine, and my dog has a great time catching the pieces that make it to the kitchen floor! All kidding aside, if I don't hold a dishtowel around the bowl, the popcorn flies out, hits the bowl and bounces wherever, NOT good, u think? In addition, it leaves many kernels unpopped! Actually, logged on to find another popper at Amazon, came across this and noticed no one had reviewed it yet. Gee...I wonder why! Well, click your mouse and find something more reliable, don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Worst Popper I've ever used,"Absolutely do not buy this product. I bought one under the label of 'Chefmate', and it's virtually worthless. It uses a convection type of air motion (it swirls) that causes at least half the corn comes out unpopped. I took it back and bought thePresto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn Popperand couldn't be happier."
3,Not good as a coffee roaster?,"This is the second one in a row that I have bought that just doesn't get hot enough to roast coffee. The maximum temperature it has reached is 421F, which won't get to the second crack, no matter how long you roast it. After 10+ years of roasting coffee this way, I am breaking down and buying a proper roaster.However, this temperature is probably quite good for popping corn."
1,Not so great,"This thing is a shining example of Design Flaws. The first time I used it, the removable plastic oval part on the hood melted and won't sit correctly now. As the previous reviewer stated, the unit pours out lots of hot but yet unpopped kernels into the bowl (and all over the counter!), where they then pop. You get popcorn flying all over the place, and hot kernels all over as well. Kernels also get stuck between the removable hood and the body, and the hood can then fall off. This creates an even bigger mess. This thing is junk. I've burned myself on the hood while trying to hold it in place for the last time. Time for the dumpster!"
1,DON 'T waste your money on this loser!,Unfortunately I bought this popper in a local store before I saw the reviews. It is the worst thing I have ever owned. It throws popcorn all over my kitchen and it throws out red hot unpopped kernals that pop later in the bowl of popped corn and take handfuls of popped corn with it. I'm throwning mine out.
2,Disappointed,"From outside the bag looks great. As they say looks can be deceptive. Thats what happened. I have more than few complaints:1. One of the customer appreciated space it offers in his/her review. Sadly I couldn't find any. After putting the power-cable and mouse, I was not able to put in a notebook without bending it. If you need to put in more stuff, just forget it.2. The strap link are poorly designed. The strap folds over to its corners. So much ado over its good looks.I was so excited when I ordered it. Now I am so disappointed"
4,Very cool watch,I was impressed with this watch from the picture and even more so once it arrived. Very sturdy and bold looking. Comes with a nice quality leather band. Since the watch is self winding (via the motion of your arm) if you don't wear it for more than two days you will have to fix the time every time you wear it. But that means there aren't any batteries to ever change so it's a small price to pay.
1,no work went into this screed,"i found a copy of this on the street. there are a lot of musings in it, largley gleaned from tables of contents of a small number of books. there is no attempt to critically analyze his basic assumption. for example, the history of lynching is not mentioned, which seems to me to suggest that the author knoews his answers before he asks the questions. there is nothing of value here, other than perhaps riling up the self-righteous lynch mob (see the first review.) but then again, it is a self-published work."
4,America Not Divided,"I liked the book overall. It made arguments that were both important and backed up with a variety of statistics. Overall I believe that this book makes an excellent point that Americans are not trying to yell to each other across a Grand Canyon of sorts, although activists and politicians are. Instead most Americans are moderates and the political climate with extremists and activists dominating each party."
3,Culture War,"It is a little hard to believe that our nation is not polarized; this book has the evidence to prove that wrong. It consists of evidence, such as graphs and charts, to prove that our country is not as polarized as the media makes it out to be. This book uses different polls, like the Gallup polls, to show that America is not greatly divided. The author argues that our nation is not divided between red and blue, but today has more of a centrist view. The author even uses key issues, like abortion and homosexuality, to prove that America is not as divided as we all think it is."
2,Misleading,"He works for the Hoover Institute...some of the findings seemed interpreted accordingly. The book didn't offer that much new that other political scientists haven't noted in the last decade. Party activists and other elites are more likely to be polarized. Aw, yeah! We learn that in Poli 100--American Politics. Correction, we teach that in the courses, when we talk about political participation. Right.That said, this book is written primarily for laypeople or folks of the authors' particular political leaning."
4,Polarized or not,"Whether you believe the U.S. is a polarized nation or not, Fiorina delivers a very readable and brief insight to our conflicted society. I have read Hunter's 1992 Cultural War and several articles and papers on the American ""culture war"" and it often difficult to agree with Fiorina.While it is a good book overall one can certainly find faults and skewed views on some of his stats. It is difficult for me to believe that this country is as united as Fiorina would have the reader believe."
4,Cemetary book,"This is a good reference book. It lists some different cemeteries in the Texas,New Mexico,Oklahoma and Arkansas region. Some I already knew about but lot I did not. It has some historical information along with several pictures of the actual cemeteries. Would have liked more information listed about some of the cemeteries in Oklahoma. I'm sure a book on each state and its famous or interesting cemeteries could be written. I would recommend it for people doing genealogy in this region."
3,"Cinderella, a disappointment","Hoping to be able to find some danceable music for my students, I found that Cinderella does not have easily transferable music. It works well for the original choreography but I did not find the music enjoyable or danceable."
3,Frozen Memories,"I found the book to be an interesting summary of the history of Minnesota hockey but I agree with the previous reviewer that there were too many errors, both typographical and informational that distracted from the flow of information for the knowledgeable Minnesota hockey fan."
2,Frozen Memories,"Book is interesting;however, in looking over a small portion of the book,I noticed glaring errors. Because of this, I don't know how accurate the other information is."
4,7 year old daughter likes it!,"My 7 year old daughter likes this book. The difficult vocabulary doesn't really bother her. The illustrations help her get the gist of the story. It's more challenging reading than Magic Treehouse, and not as idiotic as Captain Underpants (which she loves). I recommend this for 2nd graders."
1,Swiss Family Robinson,This particular edition or perhaps it's just the copy has about 1/3 of the pages blank...that is no printing. You can read two pages and then the next two are blank. My son just discovered this and we plan to return the book. I know the book is a classic and my son really wants to read it. I would just warn you not to purchase the edition from Modern Publishing Treasury of Illustrated Classics Swiss Family Robinson (Large Print)
2,swiss family robinson,I was dissappointed in the book and the quality of the illustrations. My granddaughter was not interested in reading it. I will look for another printing of this story. You highly overrated this item.
1,A big disappointment,"I was so disappointed with this book. As an animator I bought this book hoping that it would give me some idea about how to start producing my own short films and becoming an independant animator, but I soon discovered that the book had nothing to offer and the authors had no clue at all what problems animators faced in producing their own films."
1,Closing the Barn Door...,"...After the livestock has been slaughtered(or laid off due to the over-involvement of ""production types"" like the authors of this self-serving book), this title arrives after it finally looks as though the greed and stupidity of very uncreative people have killed off the animation golden goose. Such terrific timing hopefully ensures speedy oblivion for a ""how to"" that nobody needs. In other words-AVOID like the plague. No one is looking around for producers in L.A. or anywhere else, and reading this book will only set you back too many dollars. Its only future is as a textbook for the adult ed classes the authors probably hope to teach somewhere."
3,Being a goddess is not all it's cracked up to be...,"For Raheiran Special Forces Captain Gillaine Davr?, things did not look good. One minute she's just blown up a Fav'lhir warship and the next she's waking up in a sick bay 342 years in the future. But okay, she can deal with that. But, then she finds out she's been made into a Goddess with temples, shrines, magefathers, magemothers, and worst of all worshippers. This goes against everything Gillie's stands for and she's not happy.Well written, light comedy and romance in SF setting--see complete review in Jan issue of SFRevu.com"
3,Interesting setting but the simple story line,"The story has interesting setting, combine futuristic technology with magic. Unfortunately, the story line is relatively predictable and didn't take full advantage of the set-up."
1,stars,I cant understand why this or any book from Linnea Sinclair is getting more than 2 stars the story lines are week the people are lame any action unless its romance is short the people who give her good reviews probably fallowed her from her romance books
1,WORST BABY PRODUCT ON MARKET,Too bad there isnt less than one star -- this is HORRIBLEI immediately tossed it in the trashthe hole is too little and its frustrating to baby and its IMPOSSIBLE to get the lid off once you get it on - I actually had to use PLIERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Great product,"I love this little gadget, because I plug it into my laptop and don't have to worry where I take it, I'm protected against power surges anywhere. And it's so small, I don't even notice it."
2,This book changed my life.,I wish everyone would read this book. I dare you to read 5 pages into it and turn it down. You won't because it is the answer to all of our prayers which is what Jesus meant it to be.
5,best bandage,this is the best wrap bandage for my legs. I wore a self sticking one for 2 days & when I was removing it I had difficulty with it sticking to me.I have vein problems. This wrap gives me the support I need to stop the pain in my legs. I tried support hose but they were too strong & caused leg pain.This bandage can be washed & reused many times.
3,Gamma Supreme Overgrip,"Amazon's price can by high compared to other online storesdepending on which color grip you choose. All colors shouldbe under $3.25 or less.As for the grip - tacky for two or three times of use, butremains soft/cushy. Thicker than the Gamma Grip 2 so mayincrease the overall grip size a little. Worth a try ifcurious; but may want to try Prince MicroTac as well."
5,last forever,These are the best overgrips. They are tacky without feeling plastic-y and they last for a very long time. I play 3 or 4 times a week and only replace these about once a month or less.
4,one of the more popular overgrips,"The initial feel is very nice and has a modest tackiness. It does not have that ""sticky"" feel at all. There is a decent cushion as you can tell it is on the thicker side compared to other overgrips. But when playing matches my hands would start to sweat, and eventually the handle will get a bit slippery at times. I kept constantly trying to dry my hands and/or the handle. I gave the grip a 4/5 stars because overall it is a good grip.I have tried Babolat VS Grips, Yonex Super Grap, Tourna, and this Gamma Supreme. I don't think I will buy the Gamma again; it is just not for me. I am going back to the Yonex Super Grap, another popular grip."
2,tennis Gamma supreme overgrip,I didn't like it since I wanted more cushion than what it offered. It was too thin for me.
4,Feels good.,Grip has a slight tacky feeling - you get to maintain good grip on racket.1 (of the three) rolls was enough to wrap a badminton racket + leftover enough to do a racketball racket also (for me anyhow).I'd use a whole role for tennis racket.Grip itself is holding up for the last 3-4 months (average 4 hrs playing time / week).
1,DONT BUY THIS!,"This film is only 20 minutes long. The video quality is sorry. Some of the information is inaccurate (Bruce Lee is a ""Karate"" fighter?--NOT!) It advertizes itself as primarily a Bruce Lee documentary but it only gives Lee about 4 minutes of film. It does have some info that most people dont know about in terms of the pioneers of karate in the US--should have been much longer though!"
5,These guys are the pioneers of karate. Bad to the bone.,If these guys only knew the stir they would create. Great information on the dozen men responsible for spearheading karate in the USA. The footage is outrageous. Old but true.
4,Chief of Staff,"I have known the Watson family for many years. They are warm, decent, and honest people. Mr Watson's book does credit to himself and to President Johnson. It was a pleasure to read a book written by an honest man.Dr Ted FrenchSouthlake Texas"
5,Great Dictionary,"Pros - It's a must have for anyone studying Puerto rican spanish, you will not find anything better. Very extensive and detailed informationCons - It's not cheap."
5,Very Well Done!!!,"I enjoy this book from first page to last. Author is sharing his insightful analysis on the community: to seek the authentic meaning of ""community"" to this generation when importance of community is vanishing!!!Highly recommended!!! I think it is a 'must-read' for all!"
2,disagreed,"The book is well written if one agrees with his line of reasoning. Unfortunately, his insisting on the word ""head"" (as in husband being head of the marriage) as having no connotations of authority is simply wrong as far as my understanding of greek can tell.Also, his description of the trinity, in which no one member submits to the other (he consistantly uses the word ""subordination"", a tactic of feminist writers but not typically evangelical writers) strikes me as being very unorthodox. There are some scriptures he did not deal with that he would have to in order to convince a wider, Biblically literate audience of his trinitarian views."
3,Good points!,"So the title is a little off putting, it almost seems as if you're going to be manipulating your relationship and the person you're with. BUT, as soon as you start reading, you feel that there is a lot of truth in what Michelle is saying. It's not how to change the person, but really how to use their ""language"" to your benefit. It's really a guide in effective communication. Hopefully by succumbing to how your mate talks and listens, they'll be more aware of how you talk and listen, and therefore it would be mutually beneficial. Some of the analogies are a little, ""eh"", but I loved the ideas she suggested. It gives me more ideas to use in my own relationship.I wouldn't show your partner that you're reading it though, haha, may come off the wrong way!"
2,depressing,"I was given this book by a therapist who said,""Read it. Its different"". I did read it and was disappointed to find it was not that different from other ""save your marriage"" books. It reminded me of some sort of motivational book on how to get ahead in business; use positive reinforcement (don't just point out the negative)etc. Here is the problem, marriage is more intimate and personal. If I have to manipulate my way around my mate.... Well... I would just rather not. The author also makes a lot of comparisons between men and dogs and men and children. Well, that's depressing because I don't need another child or another pet. Anyway, I am disappointed. I wish authors would stop trying to make money by selling worthless advise to desperate wives."
5,In the shadow of Partlow,"I drive by Partlow every night on my way home from work. As a resident of Tuscaloosa, you sometimes forget that Partlow and Bryce are there. As you head towards the bridge to cross the river, the top of the main building at Bryce is easily seen from afar, and I'm sure visitors to the area probably think it to be an antebellum home. Instead, the sprawling grounds of Partlow and Bryce speak of the sad state of ""care"" in this state, in the past and in the present. I truly loved this book, and I always hoped after I read it for the first time that I would run in to Della Raye somewhere in town and get to meet her. I know she's gone now, but what a testament she left. I hope many more people will read this story. She never became famous, but she showed courage and perseverence and forgiveness and love to the world, a world that locked her away and demeaned her existence."
5,Compassion in words,"What a gift Mr. Penley gives to Della Raye and her family by documenting in such detail the dramatic experiences of an unfortunate girl. This story helps open the eyes of the public to horrors of some experiences in facilities for the insane (especially for those who are not insane). I read it with much interest even though I did not know the family. I was able to meet the author at a book signing. The story of how he came to write the book made it evident that he wrote this as an expression of friendship to the family, which adds depth to this work. (What a difficult work it must have been!) His quotes and details make it seem that he was there. That makes it come alive even more! In the end, I wanted to meet Della Raye as she is today. (I also recommend his other book, Rivers of Wind)."
4,Real,"I was encouraged by Rebecca's ""realness"". She spoke from her heart and allowed her true feelings to reach out to others who might not have the courage to express their own feelings. I was impressed that she shared ALL her feelings no matter how rational or irrational they were. Thanks Rebecca!"
3,Very small,This product was MUCH smaller than expected. The product picture is misleading. It is about the size of a thumb nail and red not blue. Despite this I decided to keep th product for its cuteness.
5,One of the Finest,"I first read David Thomson's Biographical Dictionary of Film in 1995, when I was 15 years old. It forever changed the way I looked at film, stars, and writing in general. Mr. Thomson is able to look at a Star/Director/Preducer and in just a few words get right to the heart of the character.Fans of his earlier edition will be happy to note many new additions of stars who came into their own in the 1990's, including Sandra Bullock, Meg Ryan, Julianne Moore, Jude Law, Leonardo DiCaprio, Nicole Kidman, George Clooney, and many more. Also included are updates on Julia Roberts, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Sharon Stone, Bruce Willis, Winona Ryder, and others who were just coming into their own when the last edition was published.Quite simply, the finest book ever written on Hollywood."
1,"It's not a dictionary, but it is a total failure","As much we can say it's eccentric, unfortunately it apparently seems that Mr. Thomson never read any film encyclopedia, lexicon, biographical dictionary or any other kind of reference book or work of lexicography. This is only some kind of his personal film guide, in fashion of Leonard Maltin, but unlike Maltin, he's totally subjective, unconcentrated, and he speaks about films in a way we can speak on street, but notin a book who claims to be some kind of reference book. If he honestly admitted it's not dictionary nor encyclopedic work, and if he didn't titled book in such uneblievably over-estimated way, everything would be OK. He can fail greatly (i.e. Pasolini's article) but he can also be totally right (i.e. Rivette's article). But this is not a dictionary, nor biographical. It's a personal guide through some films, written in journalistic style, without any connection with real ""biographical dictionary"" works."
3,surprised,"not as expected, long entries on some leaves out many other celebs of my interest...still ,usfull , impressive and author seems to enter only things of his own interest instead of his readers. just my opinion, for what little it is worth..."
3,"Compelling read, but....","This is an interestingly paradoxical book, fascinating and well-written, but questionable in its balance. It ranges from funny to (unnecessarily) vulgar (see the entry for Clara Bow), and I find myself compelled to continue reading far beyond the point when I need to put it down. Unfortunately, even his compliments are often couched in negativity. It's a must-read book, but in the end, the book itself offers a portrait of an imaginative writer who is more apt at basking in the self-illuminating glow of his own intellectuality than at any balanced evaluation of the people and films he writes about."
4,A snooty but faithful companion book,"There is an obscure connection between David Thomson and the Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse - film buffs will understand - and this book is like the restauarant - you will either love it or find it insufferably elitist. You may find Thomson's opinions cranky or but they are sincere and and founded on the the simple pleasures of being ""at the movies"".The book is equally weighted across time, meaning earlier film figures don't get short shrift. Particularly good are tantalizing references to early French and Japanese film figures, Ozu and Pagnol for example, that will make you want to seek out these hard-to-find treasures. I don't always agree with Thomson (am I the only person who loved ""1941""?), but it's always interesting to pull out this book and see where our overrated-lists agree (Affleck!) and disagree (""1941""!!)."
2,David Thomson does not love film.,"After reading thid book, it is clear to me that Mr.Thomson does not love film, in fact it has become clear to me that he does not even like film, and I will go as far to say that Mr. Thomson hates film. To Mr. Thomson, film is nothing but a springboard for his disgusting, inconsistent, elitist, cynicism. It is clear to me that Mr. Thomson is a very sad man, and something in his life rendered it impossible for him to create films, se he was cursed to a lifetime of criticism. All I can say is: Sour Grapes."
1,NOT a BIOGRAPHICAL dictionary,"This book has so little biographical information that the word should not be in the title. The typical entry gives date and place of birth as the only info about the actor. A filmography for each actor is in the entry along with critical remarks about each actor. This book is very opinionated and very critical of most of the actors listed. Many actors who are prolific, but apparently haven't done the ""right"" kind of movies are not listed. His opinons of minority actors don't bear repeating. However, his comments say that Will Smith shows that you don't need to act to be in pictures, and he states that it's hardly worth including Bruce Lee.If you are looking for BIOGRAPHICAL information this book is not what you want. If you wish one man's opinion of an actor and their performance in a particular movie, this book may help you. However, do not expect much. The book includes so many actors that the opinions expressed are very brief."
2,Does not come with label - so it's solid white,"I opened the buoys and I see there's actually no label on the buoy - so it's solid white. Upon further investigation, I see the label is actually sold separately; very strange why they would do that - very misleading on the product."
3,great product - lousy customer service,"great product, though it wasn't what i ordered - seller customer service lousy, they didn't respond to multiple emails inquiries..."
2,Finally,The product showed up a month late from American Wholesale. I hope they do better in the future. I wanted this for emergency purposes and hope that I will not have to use it.
2,Does not cure skin cancer,I read on the internet iodine cures skin cancer. It did not work on mine. It doesn't cure psoriasis either. This is not the manufacturer's fault. It's fine iodine.
4,great slasher / mystery!,"If you are a fan of low budget, indie Horror films, check this one out!Ms. Teal weaves a ""whodunit"" mystery, while integrating the important horror elements: ie, sex, nudity, and lots of blood!"
2,I Really Wanted To Like It...,"But I just didn't. I didn't think any of the characters rang true. They were all rather one sidedto me. I didn't buy into the ""everbody is wrong "" philosophy it seemed to espouse. What it's okay for a were wolf or a fae to kill or maim a human because ""it is their nature."" That's like saying a serial killer is just being true to his nature!And after 9/11 the point of view of anyone or anything desrtoying New York and hurting New Yorkers is simply unacceptable to me!I love this kind of Fairy Realms sort of thing but seriously dislike this one. I doubt I'll buy anything else by this lady."
4,Blood and Iron,"This book can be a little confusing at first, but stick with it and you won't be disapointed!"
1,WHY! WHY! WHY!,"What is the point of these little ""hand pick"" episode DVDs. Its not like FOX wouldnt make enough money off of the box sets if they released them at a faster pase. Ok, the simpsons holiday DVDs have been good, but thats it. ""Gone Wild"",""Bart Wars"", and now ""Kiss and Tell"". I just feel like with the no doubt millions of Simpsons fans out there, FOX would be more interested in making bigger $$$ with the box sets than these single disk collections that retail around $10.00. WHY, WHY WHY!WE WANT THE BOX SETS FASTER!!! (kinda like ""Futurama"" and ""Family Guy"") Thanks anyway FOX for not listening to your fans."
1,Bottom of the barrel...,"Wow, four of the most forgettable and regrettable episodes of the recent Simpsons. This show has been on a very noticeable slide since Season 9 and all this DVD does is prove that the show should have been canceled a while ago (keep in mind that this comes from somebody who owns all the box sets and peppers all of his everyday conversations with quotes from the golden years of the show).I have no problem with the 4-show DVD's, I would just prefer GOOD episodes to be of those 4."
4,Exactly as described,"bought this product for a class - said it was used and in good condition, and when received, it was exactly as it said. there were obvious signs of wear, but the product is in great shape. I was impressed, though, by how quickly the seller shipped the item. :D"
5,No complaints - high quality cotton swabs,"The stick is fairly sturdy for a cotton swab, and the quality of the overall product is high. These work well for various purposes that cotton swabs are normally used for."
4,unexpected blue collar delights,"It's been a long time since a book of plays inspired ANY sort of reaction...this is a mixed bag, but at least the work [for the most part] feels as new as the title promises. Worth a read, whether or not you love everything you find. [strongest piece? Leon Chase's oil stained rag of a masterpiece...raw, rough and brilliant]."
2,I'm not impressed.,"The title of this review says it all. I was expecting some hip, exciting work from NY's young up-and-comers, and I'm sad to say I've read/heard/seen better from unpublished playwrights in other parts of the country. Disappointing."
5,Awesome jockstrap,Loved this jockstrapmy boyfriend especially liked the way it felt (not too scratchy like some other jockstraps) and the look was amazing on this classic ace strapthe only complaint is the thin leg strapsoverall great fetish gear
3,"READ MY REVIEW IF YOU WANT TO, BUT LEAVE YOUR FRIENDS BEHIND......","IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT I HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY READ THIS, I IMAGINE IT'S SPELLBINDING. I DID READ LEAVES OF THE LAST HOME, AND THAT WASN'T SO BAD. IT WASN'T GREAT EITHER, THOUGH.SEQUELS ARE USUALLY DISAPPOINTING, IN MY EXPERIENCE. LEAVES OF THE LAST HOME WAS A BIT OF A BURDEN TO READ, TO BE HONEST. IN FACT, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND EITHER ONE OF THEM. BUT, IF YOU INSIST UPON READING ONE OR THE OTHER, READ LEAVES OF THE LAST HOME FIRST. OR MAYBE SECOND. OR NOT AT ALL. I WOULD TRY THE FORMER, I THINK."
5,Utterly brilliant,"Although Paul Zindel is a literary genius, this far surpassed my highest expectations. David and Della are fascinating people, although a bit unbelievable. The story is gripping (I finished it in one day) and, in its own way, suspenseful: as Della's past is brought to light, she begins to slowly make sense, a great tactic. This is a book I will read many times."
5,David & Della,"This story was lively and entertaining, for sure. Zindel has a way with developing zany characters who feel deeply."
4,"Zany, and fast-paced","This book was a lot of fun but awfully unbelievable. David and Della are an interesting pair of characters (literally) and any reader looking for a fun, fast-paced read will enjoy this story."
5,An Excellent Book for the Craps Beginner,"If you are just learning to play craps, this is the book you need to read before you risk any money in the casino. Mr Medansky does an excellent job of covering the basics of how to play, but then goes beyond this recommends important money managment and betting guidelines.Those craps players looking for a system will find one in Mr. Medansky's book. He discloses his evaluation of the system using The Craps System Tester and even his results playing the system in Las Vegas Casinos.I like Mr. Medansky's sidebar chapters, too, on the history of the game,comps and craps trivia..."
3,"Pay a buck more and get an incredible ""Speedway at Nazareth""","What's here is fine: the superb ""Why Aye Man,"" the neat, biting ""Small Potatoes,"" and a pleasant version of ""So Far Away."" But another version of this single, Amazon #B00006JY8O, gives you the same three songs PLUS a truly astonishing live version of ""Speedway at Nazareth""--for only a dollar more. That version of ""Speedway"" is transcendent stuff, Knopfler and band in another realm, total intensity and commitment. The performance there is an example of what sets Mark Knopfler apart from virtually all other rock performers. So my advice is to pay the extra dollar for the extra song--it's well worth it, IMHO."
4,Good Introduction.,"This biography written towards children and young adults works well as an introduction to the life of Thomas Alva Edison. The basic outline of Edison's life is told in simple terms and includes descriptions about the three inventions Edison is most given credit for inventing: the phonograph, electric light, and motion picture. The illustrations are nice and add to the text of the story. Great reading for youth who like to learn."
5,This game is incredible,"I haven't been able to put this game down since I bought it (well, I had to put it down because I was playing it so long that my left hand started cramping up). The grapics are incredible and the movement is amazing. I love puzzle games and this one is challenging and addictive. If you're not a person who has the patience and persistance for solving puzzles, this game isn't for you but if you are a person who loves puzzles, this game is a ""must have"" for your collection."
4,Mercury is mercu-rific!,So I purchased Wipe Out Pure and got blown away by an amazing racing game on the PSP. Than I purchased Metal Gear Acid and was blown away by the depth of the game play and story line. With both games conquered I needed another PSP game fix and fast! There were quite a few to choose from but the beautiful graphics and unique game play brought me to the world of Mercury.This game is like a mixture between super monkey ball and marble madness. It provides really challening but not impossible puzzles. Even when you have trouble passing a level you are determined to finish. The more you play the better you get. The lush landscapes and tight control make this a great puzzle to get your hands on and will compliment your PSP game collection quite well. Another fantastic PSP game experience making this system a very worth while purchase. I hightly recommend it.
2,kinda fun but not really into it,I got this for cheap but based from online recommedations and I don't particularly like it. Steep learning curve and dated graphics/game play. Kind of a neat idea that may be cleaned up in the newer edition but after trying this I'm not that interested.
3,"A decent time killer, but not really worth 40 bucks","If this puzzle game were $10-$15 cheaper I'd have rated it four stars. It has nice graphics, easy controls and makes a good time killer, esp. when you want a respite from playing real PSP games, or waiting in the ER for a doctor to look at your aching wrists. But $40 is really too much to pay for a mechanic game like this."
3,3 stars for Creativity -2stars for difficulty,Do you like games that are creative? This game is the most creative puzzler to come along in years. And it looks extremely cool to go with it. Now the problem. It's stinkin hard. Do you really want a creative game where you can't get past the first 10 levels? That is surely going to happen to you. It is a shame as this game could have been a kick tail game.Bottom Line: Is it fun? For the first 7 levels. Will I keep it? No way. Unless you like to replay the first 10 levels over and over again. Is it for kids? Too hard.
2,A very Dull and Boring Game,"PSP mercury, to me at least was a waste of money. If you were looking for a challenging addictive game, I would have to say pick up Lumines. Mercury feels just like a beta tested game you would find online. The graphics are all in the intros of each level and i have to say if that's all they are offering, wow do they need to go back to the drawing board. Granted for the marble madness maniacs out there pick it up and go nuts, but for gamers who are hungry for more than a dull game.I say stay away."
2,waste,Its fun at first but is way to short and you get bored of it after 2 or 3 days I highly sugjest you do not buy this but if you relly want it rent it but never buy it.
5,"An easy, accessable guide to concert-going & classical music","Writing as a librarian, former music major, and classical music lover, I believe I can honestly say that ""Evenings with the Orchestra"" is one of the best, most readable guides to the whole classical music experience I've ever read. Everything, from proper concert hall behavior, to the great composers and their most often-heard works, to profiles of the great orchestras and conductors, is discussed in a straightforward, fascinating style. If you're a beginning classical music lover, this book will be an invaluable guide. If you're experienced with the classics, this book will only serve to enhance your enjoyment. Highly recommended!"
4,So Cute!!,"You better jump on this while you can! This set costs twice as much on every other baby website and it has ""free shipping!!"" It's really cute & the fitted sheet will fit your crib, so if you have the crib bedding, you get an extra matching crib sheet to use! Plus, you get the soft fleece blanket as well. So half of this set will transition from infant to toddler! This is one of the few sets I found that has the matching crib & toddler bedding and the price is EXCELLENT!!!"
3,Just okay.,The construction of the waffle iron is good; it stores standing up and the cord wraps around. My problem with it is that the edges of the waffles are still very underdone when the light signals the waffle is done. So you need to leave it in longer than the sensor says.
2,Lots of spillover,"I've had this waffle iron for about six months, and I still haven't figured out how to get consistently browned waffles with minimal spillover. The center gets over-done, while the corners stay pale and spongy, and tons of batter ends up on the counter.The only good thing about it is the non-stick surfaces are really non-stick."
1,DON'T DEAL WITH THIS VENDOR,"Horrendous experience with this vendor. They sent the wrong product (a Christmas present ordered in plenty of time), never responded to my emails, and finally contacted me AFTER I filed a complaint through Amazon.com. Then I heard nothing until after Amazon credited my money back. THEN turtletools emailed a call tag (something I'd requested in my very first email.) They made a stressful time of year even more stressful. As it turns out they no longer carry this product but couldn't be bothered removing it from the website or telling me when I emailed...other reviews let me know I'm not the first person this exact thing has happened to with this product and this vendor. BUYER BEWARE"
4,great product for the money,The toastmaster Waffler # TWB4REG is a great waffle maker for the money.I wanted a waffler that made 4 waffles at a time and have looked in many stores. The only ones I could find were very expensive. This one on line is inexpensive and works great with easy convenient storage. I recommend this to anyone on a budget!
1,Poorly executed waffle iron,"We have tried two of these waffle irons with a third one on the way. The first one cooked extremely poorly in some areas and hardly at all in other sections. While the waffle iron had four squares, it seemed that the heating element covered only a small circle in the middle. The second iron was a slight improvement, but still inadequate with the heating element limited to a circle. We await using the third waffle iron, but do not expect great things. The manufacturer has been cooperative in responding to our disappointment."
3,"Information is great, presentation is poor","The information contained in this volume is fine, however the frequent typographical and grammatical errors make reading a chore."
2,Flakey,"I've been using this mat for a little over a month, for a 5 day-a-week practice. At first I was thrilled, but at the end of my 2nd class, I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet. It's continued to get worse and worse, 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice, and scatter on the floor around me. Since I practice in a studio, it's particularly annoying. I practice with the ""sticky"" side down, and the jute side up. The jute side is the side that flakes. Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem, but then the mat inchworms across the floor."
2,giam eco conscious jute yoga mat not so great,"This mat is not sticky enough. i didn't feel stable and grounded when i used it. My feet and hands felt they were about to slip. it is beautiful and I will continue looking for that perfect eco-conscious yoga mat, but this one isn't it."
2,"Beautiful, but itchy and stiff","I love the look of this mat, but I didn't find it very comfortable. It's stiffer and scratchier than a typical yoga mat. I thought I was treating myself, but ended up going back to my old blue one! Beautiful concept, but I think they need to work on the material."
5,Uh.. right,"Wow. This is the most unique movie I have ever seen. I saw ads for this elsewhere, but didn't really pay much attention to them.. then I got this as a gift. Its just plain weird funny, nothing else to it. Buy this movie, you're guaranteed lots of laughs."
1,"total garbage, don't waste your time",just another director trying to capitalize on the Star Wars name with a haphazard parody
3,Not As Funny As I Expected...,"Being a huge fan of ""Kung Pow!: Enter the Fist"" (the funniest movie ever made), I just had to see one of these Thumbation movies. I ordered it from Amazon and watched it as soon as it arrived. I was disappointed, needless to say...Why didn't I laugh as much as I wanted to? Because I'm not a Star Wars fanatic? I don't know. But this film didn't crack me up too much. The only few things that did were Chewy's facial expressions and everything about Yoda's ""hand-puppetry"". Also, the character profiles are pretty hilarious as well.Even though this lacked the hilarity I found in Kung Pow!, I'll still check some more Thumbation movies, and keep hoping I'll get something as good..."
2,Is nothing sacred anymore?!,"Has Steve Oudekerk no shame? What's next? Easy Thumber, Seven Thumbs for Seven Pinkies, Thumberella, Thumbi, The Bad News Thumbs, Frankenthumb, The Dozen Dirty Thumbnails, The Good The Bad and the Unclipped, It's a Wonderful Thumb? Obviously no movie is off limits to his bizarre sense of humor!Though my children appreciate Thumb Wars more than I, it did have it's funny moments. And the trailer for Thumbtanic looked pretty funny too."
2,"Well, the kids love it anyway","I can't believe my husband bought this! He never impulse buys but what possessed him to buy this I'll never know. It must be that he's a die hard Star Wars fan. Anyway, the kids love it. They've got it memorized and it's not uncommon to go on a road trip and have them recite the entire movie from memory. What I don't like is the whole ""Touch your tongue to mine"" thing - it's just gross. I can also do without Loke (Luke) and Scooby (Obi)looking up Bunhead's (Leia's) dress. But I gotta admit, Steve Ouderkirk (sp?) hits the nail right on the thumb by pointing out and making fun of some of the many silly things in the Lucas films. Luke really is quite a whiner, Yoda really is a puppet, Obi-wan Kenobi really is the silliest name in the galaxy and Princess Leia's cinnamon roll hairdo always did annoy me. Even if you don't particularly like this movie, your kids will love it."
5,Thumb Wars! Something worth watching overandover again!,"If you have seen ""Thumb Wars"" on TV, then you will be surprised with this DVD. The DVD contains a new version of the movie with new footage, cut from the tv version because of time and the need for commercials. THank god, they edited out the commercials and restored the remaining movie with new scenes to make it a short 29 minutes. But the lack of movie is made up with features. There are trailers for Thumb Wars, Thumbtanic (I hope that will come out soon, because that looks hilarious), and The Blair Thumb (being released on DVD on January 22, 2002), an interview with Gabba The Butt (seen in the movie only once), Thumbographies, poor Dolby 5.1 audio, an okay sounding 2.0 Dolby soundtrack, and an audio commentary with the director. BUy this movie now!"
5,What a Great Filmette,"If you like science fiction spoofs, this show is for you. Anyone mildly familier with the original Star Wars will love the whiney Loke Groundrunner and his new friends as they battle Black Helmet Man and the Bad bad, good, bad thumpire. This movie has more silliness than most small countries, but it is a must see in my book."
5,Thumb .... WOWS,This DVD is very funny ! I got it for my 10th birthday and everyone in my whole neighboorhood loved it . It has lots of action and the special effects are cool ! YOU SHOULD BUY THIS MOVIE !
2,Not great,"I bought this to replace a unit I had for about 10 years. It is not great, stops and starts, and was not NIB, leading me to believe that it was not new at all."
1,DOA,I was perfectly happy with one of these until it died after many years of service. After checking out the new models and finding them visually offensive - call me crazy but i don't think a tooth brush needs to make a fashion home decoration statement - i found this replacement on Amazon. It arrived dead on arrival in suspicious packaging (as if it had just been slapped into a generic plastic bag from the last person who had returned it). The company took it back as if they expected to.I wound up getting a more recent but much uglier model which actually work a LOT better. It turns out the mechanical technology s improving ... the appearance is going in the other direction - seriously ugly! Get a new one.
3,"Bought 2, one died after a few months...","I bought two of these, but one went intermittent within a month and finally just died. Cheaper than buying new, but they don't last as long as they should..."
2,Braun Toothbursh-HINT,"I thought I was going to write a terrible review because mine only lasted 9 months, however after reading the other reviews I feel so lucky to have gotten 9 months. I should have known something was up when the timer stopped working, but I thought I was being impatient and kept brushing. Now the thing's completely dead and no amount of charging will bring it back to life. So disappointed because I just bought new brushes last week. Now trying to decide if it's worth it to purchase another or save my money for the dentist.UPDATE/HINT: after use, remove the brush and store the handle upside down. It some how works better. I thought mine was a dead battery, and somehow this works. I was using the tower to store it after each use previously and it completely stopped working and charging. Once I started to store it upside down the battery problems went away."
2,Don't waste your money,Within one month after buying this toothbrush it refused to turn on sometimes. Then it would turn off during the brushing after 1 minute. Finally after 4 months of using it it wouldn't turn on at all. Don't waste your money with this one.
5,great company !,"the best customer service I have ever had !!!!!no problem making an exchange, very fast return,thank you so much."
1,Died in less than two months,It worked for less than two months. Also note that this unit is not compatible with most Braun chargers that have a round peg with a key. This one fits chargers with an rounded trapezoidal pegs.
5,Braun 4729-630 Toothbrush Power Handle 1 Speed,I bought this as a replacement for one I broke. It is an excellent replacement.
4,one-speed power handle,"The speed is comparable to the lower speed of a dual-speed handle we used to have. Although I was expecting that the one-speed handle goes at the speed comparable to the higher one, it works fine at the half of price of the dual speed handle. The dual speed handle that came with original package died after 8 years service for two of us, the replacement dual-speed handle I bought through Amazon, however, dies after one year. Will see how long this one-speed handle will work."
2,Fifty fifty,"I had two similar units working for ages. Recently one of them started acting weird by not reacting to me pressing the button so I decided to replace both of them.I bought two of these. They have the same functionality (1 speed, timer), but the first impression was they looked like cheaper version of my old units.Anyway, the one works just fine while the other one stopped working after only few days (still waiting for rma approval). That's not what I would expect from the quality product.I have read the reviews here and I kind of expected this, but still it is disappointing."
1,Possible bad batch,Maybe we received a batch with faulty batteries but we purchased 2 in Nov. 2011. One lasted 2 months and the other just died at the 5 month mark. Nothing wrong with the charger as an original model still charges and works fine.
2,NO SHIPPING!!!,"Item was shipped to a WRONG adress in Ny - instead the one I requested in LA. That hppened almost a month ago!Just tracked it via USPS today to realise that..Now , I need to change an adress as I am not going to be in LA in the near future..So I sent the company a request for an EXPRESS , IMMEDIATE delivery to the new address which is in NYC...appreciate any help..."
5,WOW!,"I baught this CD primarily because I play the sax and I was interested in exploring the jazz sound, by listening. This is definately my favorite jazz (or anything else) CD, at the moment. The 1st 3 tracks deserve 5 stars... the second 3 deserve 6. I would reccommend this to anyone who... just anyone."
5,MUSIC,VERY SOOTHING SOUNDS TO LISTEN TO. ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE TO RELAX AND MELLOW OUT.I WOULD RECOMMENED IT VERY HIGHLY
5,Smooth Jazz and Winelight,"Heard this cd being played at the Piety Flats Winery salesroom in Wapato, WA. Created a lovely atmosphere for browsing and tasting some wines. Bought some of their delightful wines and now with the cd, we can enjoy it all, sitting by a warmly crackling fire, sipping the ""nectar of the gods"" listening to a perfect accompaniment!"
5,No title,I bought this tape many moons ago and wore it out just as many moons ago. I used to drive to Yosemite and San Francisco on weekends and Winelight was my companion on those trips. Grover was and still is the best to listen to.
5,My ALL TIME FAVORITE ...........PERIOD,Sweet and simple...........My favorite of all time........PERIOD............Grover you were the best SAX man ever!!!!!!!!
5,"Grover, You're The Best!","I have always been a huge fan of Mr. Grover Washington Jr.'s music. He paved the way for all Smooth Jazz Artists of our generations with his soulful smooth saxophone delights. His tone was unique and undeniable. All musicians need to study this legend. Winelight is a classic piece. ""Mr. Magic"" is still relevant today. That's an incredible feat."
1,not happy,Paid in April and have never recieved item. Several emails. I even telephoned. It is now July.
3,Peaceful home life.,"Although I enjoyed reading this book, I haven't been able to put these ideas into practice. I don't know if my daughter is simply to old to start or if her personality is just too forceful, but this happy home relationship is definitely something to shoot for even if we never truly reach it."
4,Thorough and fair,"Dr. Paxton's book is an insightful exploration of how Adventism has struggled to hold fast to and articulate the proper understanding of justification and sanctification in light of the Reformation. Despite the church's claim to be the end-time movement that will inherit and fulfill what God began through Luther - ""the special heirs of the Reformation"" - it has often presented a muddled understanding of whether or not righteousness by faith is justification ALONE or a blend of justification plus saving good works.A very good read, and helpful to believers of all faiths who wish to have a fuller understanding of the totality of justification's power. It also helps flesh out the dynamcis of Catholic vs. Protestant understandings regarding the salvation process."
1,Cheap-Looking Ripoff Earrings,"Stop! Don't even consider buying these earrings! You do could better at any ""dollar store"". The gold wires are so thin that you'd better not breathe on them or they will bend or snap in two.The Fleur de lis or whatever it is supposed to be is so thin and sharp it might cut you. The ""created"" stones are a light phony blue and look nothing even close to real sapphires. The stones do not ""hang right"" as all of the weight is on the back causing the front to tip up, (which doesn't really matter, I guess, as they are too little to be seen anyhow). They are overpriced by about $68.00."
4,Classic Euro-Disco,"1. How Much, How Much I Love You 7.5/102. Beauty and the Beast 8/103. Maybe 9/10Okay, so ""How Much, How Much I Love You"" is not the epic that ""Romeo & Juliet"" was. (Please make ""Romeo & Juliet"" availble on CD!). ""How Much, How Much I Love You"" is a good, enjoyable Euro-Disco song. However, the song could have done with more lyrics. ""Beauty and the Beast"" may be a little cheesey, however if you like Euro-Disco, you probably won't even notice. This one is better than ""How Much..."" ""Maybe"" is a sparkling Pop ballad that is romantic & beautiful. It is quite a very pleasant surprise with good vocals too. All the songs have a good, smooth vocals. Overall, this CD is worthy to any club/dance fan or lover of Euro-Dance/Disco and lesser known danceclub music gems."
5,Awesome family routine,"Love this book of devotionals. We do one every night. Although they are geared towards our 14 year old teenage daughter, our younger son's, 8 and 5 LOVE participating as well."
1,Be careful!,"I bought this charger, and it won't fit either of two Braun electric toothbrushes my wife and I own, although they were bought a different times. Be careful to check the model number and compare it with the list that's given in one line of the description so that you don't waste twenty bucks as I did."
5,Braun Travel 100-240 volt toothbrush charger,"If you want to take your electric toothbrush with you when you travel abroad, this is compact, and works (with an adaptor). You just have to check that the opening in the bottom of your toothbrush, where it sits to charge, is the right opening, and unfortunately, it was hard to get this information anywhere on the web. (This was the only one I found that specified the voltage!)"
1,"Be careful, you will need to adjust it yourself!","I bought this item together with a toothbrush advertised as ""frequently bought together"". Unfortunately, the charger did not match the toothbrush. I followed the advice of other users and cut off some o the plastic from the charger. Now they match but I worry that it may cause electrical problems or simply be dangerous. I would like to appeal to the sellers to provide clear information about the chargers' voltage (I needed a multisystem one as I travel a lot internationally) and types of toothbrushes to match them. Otherwise it is just a scam."
1,Doen't fit my Braun toothbrush,Looks like it should fit my toothbrush but it doesn't. I have no idea why Bruan makes these super subtle changes to the charger shape so that you can't get a universal Braun Oral B charger. It's annoying and now I have to buy a new toothbrush when all I want is a replacement charger. Make sure the toothbrush you have is one of the models listed before you buy this.
1,You can't handle the tooth about these cavity clowns!!,"I no longer believe in Xmas now that my electric tooth brush charger is missing and the first 48 hours are over. Fear, resentment, gingivitis are just a few of the bad tastes, reflective of this company's poor treatment of my mouth."
4,Braun 4725-623 100-240 VAC Universal Electric Toothbrush Charger Travel Base,"This charger was purchased because it functionally matches a base that was fried in Europe. It works fine. Then it was taken to Europe a second time with the toothbrush but only one of two of us had the brush motor to use with it. I ordered both (brush motor and universal charger), but the motor was not shipped because ""out of stock."" I have not been able to find a motor compatible with the charger yet, but I'm still looking."
4,SHAPE IT,The product arrived on time. It might not fit your model number but you can easily shape it to fit into the base of the toothbrush. I used a sharp knife and sand paper to fit. It is an inexpensive charger and works fine with any voltage for traveling.
2,Not for the Sonic Complete,If you have a Sonic Complete that was purchased prior to 2006 do not buy this adapter it will not work and trimming the stem will damage the charger. Recommend you purchased a dual voltage one or a transformer to convert the voltage.Amazon needs to this remove it from the search function as a replacement part for 4729.
1,RB,I must agree that the sound quality is awful on this CD. What is worse is that I purchased this recording hoping that it would have danceable tempos (I am a former ballerina and current studio owner) and that is definitely not the case. Giselle's variation is quite brisk and other important variations are missing altogether. Definitely not worth the money.
3,Some information out-of-date,"As are all Haynes Manuals this book is an excellent source of information for do-it-yourselfers. Problem is they need to update the book. When I asked for some of the ""new"" paint products at a body shop they told me I would need to go to a museum."
4,Excellent book on body work. Lots of good information.,"Well written, well organized, lots of good information. If you are like me and want to attempt some of my own body work, this book is for you too. A lot of books on this subject just skim the surface of the topic and show a few pictures. This book is well organized, in depth and easy to read and learn from. Well worth the price. Like many Haynes manuals, it pays for itself first time out. Thanks Haynes, thanks Amazon.Regards, Pag"
4,nice book,"although not as detailed as some books ,it cover a lot of the basics and was well worth the money"
1,Don't buy it!,I'm sorry but I was looking for the original versions and there is no one includes on this album!
5,codemaster,"one of the best games i have ever played, excellent graphics and excellent gameplay, the only thing is that it's just to darn easy to beat, but that's why there are two disks"
3,questionable craftsmanship,"I got this as a gift. My first time using it, I noticed that the handle seemed a bit loose. It is a plastic handle screwed onto the wood shaft. I was only using the shovel to clean out ashes from an outdoor fireplace so it was a low impact job. I do like the fact that the bit the spade seems very well connected to the shaft....the metal sheath extends pretty high."
3,satisfactory car camp cot,"great, easy set up and break down (less than 2 minutes) a little shakey for this 225 pounder, had a sore back when slept on it the first night, this might be my back, not the cot.....would recommend blankets under sleeper, as the fabric allows a cool draft to come from under...well worth the price, would recommend if your expectation is for an occasional bed you can haul in your trunk of your car."
5,Excellent resource,This book would be a good choice as either a college textbook or as a casual read for anyone interested in gene/environment interactions. I believe the topic is of particular importance and the presentation is superb.
1,Headset doesn't charge ... a known issue. Don't buy it,"I've just received it yesterday and the light for the headset goes off after 10-15 seconds. I've checked the contacts for headset were connected to the charger correctly. I've read the manual (yeah, believe or not). Unfortunately the unit will not charge. I went to Logitech website (yeah, first thing I should do before, but...) and, surprise... it is a known issue for two users. I'm wondering if they also bought it through Amazon.com. I was unable to find out if Logitech answered their questions.DON'T BUY IT IF YOU CAN'T TEST IT BEFORE, in other words: Don't buy it here, in Amazon.com"
1,Faulty manufacturing,ASIN:B0006IWLWG Tripp Lite PR3 3-Amp DC Power Supply 120VAC Input to 13.8VDC Output]]I received this item and it was faulty in that it was only putting out 2 or 3 volts DC and would not power my 12 volt device. Amazon instantly shipped another one and the replacement was putting out 17 volts which nearly fried the device that i was trying to power.I have sourced another product that will deliver a consistent acceptable power supply. I would not recommend purchase of this product.
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS $#!T!!!! SERIOUSLY!!!!,"All this $#!t is is just the foreign version of Fatal Attraction with a brief mix of failed revenge thrown in! This flick was poorly made, the story sucks, the subtitles are hard to see and read at times and noone worth giving damn about survives! The whole movie itself is just confusing. My personal opinion ""DON'T TOUCH THIS PIECE OF $#!T!"" Just to name actors who are much, much worse but any of their worthless flicks are better than this: David Chiang, Sonny Chiba, Dragon Lee, Billy Chong, and if you can find him Jhoon Rhee! LEAVE THIS $#!T ALONE! IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR TIME AND IT NEVER WILL BE! DON'T BUY IT, DON'T RENT IT AND IF YOU JUST HAPPEN TO SEE IT ON THE CLEARANCE RACK JUST KEEP WALKING! To give you a better understanding of just how bad this movie is it clearly looks like a bad Japanese opera that was acted out by cleaned up but still drunk homeless people!"
5,Kaotic is off tha hook.,This kat has it all. If PAC would have never exisred this man would have probably took on all the attention he got.This KIDD is an all star in the making.
4,Thank you amazon reviewers,I was looking for some mink type blankets but I skipped over this one because it is listed as hot pink. Since I am not five or running a brothel I wasn't very interested in hot pink blankets. But then I read the reviews and reviewers were saying that it is a prettier pink.I ordered two of these blankets and they arrived just in time for record cold (-20). They are absolutely gorgeous. The color is a soft rose pink. The blankets are thick and lovely. I have been so glad to have them to snuggle up under.
5,Soft nice baby pink,"Like another reviewer - the color is NOT hot pink. It is a very nice soft ""baby"" pink color. Good size; it cover my 12"" foam mattress. Looks great on my platform bed. Use on top w/shams - or inside duvet. Not as heavy as the other ""mink"" blankets (which are also very nice, but a little smaller) - but very nice on a cold night."
2,Not Impressed,"This product looked so wonderful, it's anything but. The color is far from pictured, it's more of a peachy coral. I washed the blanket on gentle cycle and dried it on the air dry cycle, to be gentle on it. It fuzzes ALL over the place, making it look like I have a pink cat roaming around my house. So disappointed. Would never purchase another of these blankets."
5,A Bible for the die hard Sox fan.,"This book is a great one for catching up on the Sox' history throughout the eras. From the Black Sox to the Go-Go Sox to the Big Hurt. It contains almost everything a fan would need to know and would want to know. It did not include all the great players career stats but does with a few. Overall, a thick book but a great and easy read."
4,"WHAT, WHO?","JIGGA!!!!!!...has done it again I would have to say Jay-Z is one of the best lyricist of all time his flow is so smooth and his delivery is like the postman of the month, always on time. The only thing that kind of took away from the album was too many collabo's but not enough Jigga flows. Too be honest the collabo's wasn't that bad, I mean he had the #1 Dog DMX, the silky, yet improving Foxy Brown, and not to mention the hyped up Memphis Bleek."
3,Jay-Z: Bomb lyracist gone commercial,"With this album, Jay-Z has gone mainsteam and the album suffers because of it. Jay-z, one of the smoothest skylers of all time continues to amaze with phat rhymes, but the beats and samples are sub-par. As Cipher Complete said: "" Not a terrible album, but true hip-hop fans will come away dissapointed."
3,It's Aight,"I seriously thought this sh*t'll blow up, but it didn't go up to my temptations.Of couse, u know i'm still bobbin to Resevoir Dogs(that is a mad ill song)"
3,Makes wonderful popcorn... but,"This popcorn popper made excellent popcorn, but the plastic ""window"" became soiled and was impossible to clean. Shortly after buying it, the wooden handles on the hinged lids came off and the popcorn popper became virtually unusable.The pot iself was beautifully made and sturdy, but the lid, hinges and handles were flimsy and didn't hold up to weekly use.This popper might be ideal if only used infrequently or if the person purchasing has time to spend cleaning all the nooks and crannys and repairing the lid."
2,Good Popper but...,I'm glad that I lost it in Hurricane Ivan. I had one of these and it worked well enough except for the viewing window and the way the lid attached to the base. The viewing window cracked right by the screw that holds it in place. This allowed the hot oil to escape and burn me occasionally. The lid was held in place by inserting the end of the crank handle through a hole in the side of the pan. The lid was difficult to close if you didn't have it lined up just right. There is another brand of popper like this one but the lid has a clasp that fastens over the top edge of the popper's base and I believe that is the one I will get to replace the one I lost.
3,Wish it hadn't broken,"Great popcorn popper, overall.The lid is a little difficult to get on and off, and after a few years, it doesn't close all the way. The plastic window broke, but was still usable after I taped it back together. The plastic window finally broke beyond repair. A replacement window only costs $2...but shipping is $8!! That is a rip off!I may have to get another brand to replace this one, but it was good while it lasted."
4,This works,"This product is quiet. I installed this fan in power supplier. double ball bearring system seems works. But I found out Office depot sells simiar product, which located very closed to my home. I am going to buy this kind of product from office depot next time to save shippping an handling fee."
2,Poor attention to detail,Be careful and look at the tail between the tiger's legs. It is not round and actually looks broke in real life. Being from LSU I know for a face that Mike's tail is rounded and black tipped. I'm worried to give this as a gift now because the receiver is just as big a fan as myself. Poor attention to detail.
2,Author needs to decide what kind of book she wants to write,"This first effort is disappointing: the author seems unsure whether she wants to write an historical mystery or bodice ripper. Also, the writing itself is poor, with modern expressions sprinkled casually throughout, and a lack of careful editing (e.g., Lord Nicholas Peverell compliments a monk on how well the wine goes with the suckling pig...except that the pig has yet to be served, something that's apparent a few lines before and a few lines after!). An amateurish novel."
3,An entertaining read,"I love mysteries that are set in Tudor times so I was pleasantly surprised to stumble upon this book at my local library.It is an entertaining book and will appeal to people who are interested in the Tudor era. It is evident the author is well acquainted with the geography in which this book is set, as her descriptions are quite colorful and fascinating. However, I have two criticisms of this book. 1) As another reviewer has pointed out, there are too many modern-day phrases that don't belong there. For example, one character asks another ""What's up?"". 2) The ending was rather anticlimactic. The identity of the killer wasn't particularly shocking. The chapters leading up to it, however, were quite well done."
5,Excellent product,"I've printed 1000's of photos using different brands of papers and had been satisfied with the results. You know, the brands that are available at the local walmart. However, I was stunned at the difference when I started using the Ilford paper.My photos have a more professional look to them. Maybe it's because I have shot thousands of photos and my skill has improved a little bit. I'm inclined to give the paper the bigger share of the credit.If you use a junk printer then don't waste your money on better paper. The paper can't exceed the limitations of the printer. I have two different epson stylus photo series printers and I can see a difference between the papers."
5,quality,"Having used a cheaper grade of paper in the past, there just isnt any comparison. This product certainly justfys the extra few dollars to use it."
1,Doesn't work with the Wii,"Tried multiple routers, USB ports and wired settings, but I couldn't get it to work. I'm sending it right back. Don't get it."
1,ethernet for wii console,"Need a wired connection for wii console, so bought this however couldnt get it to work. Is unusable to me."
5,As described,"Works as described.My personal use for this product was to seal what I thought was an air leak in my car door (turns out it was just the rubber weather seal getting off track). I can't quite vouch for how the product performs with sound-deadening regard, but it is pretty neat. It sprays on uniformly and dries in a reasonable amount of time (little more than a half hour). It is also on there for the long haul. It can be removed with proper chemicals and technique, but it won't wear off with just pressurized water or intense sun.I'll have to find a use for the rest of mine. It's a good product and seems to live up to its promise.I know this review may not be all that helpful, but take from it what you get-- If you think you have a use for it, get it."
3,Thin,"I purchased this product to spray in my wheel wells and to coat the inside of my car, to dampen noise. I thought the rubberized spray would be a bit thicker than it is, as it is basically three layers of paint thick, after all is said and done. It does come out of the can nicely, sprays consistently, and is easy to control. I purchased two cans to coat about 5 square feet of trunk and wheel well space, and it was just barely enough. For the price, I would expect a larger area of coverage, but now you all know what each can is capable of."
3,Goes on thick. takes forever to cure,"this stuff seems pretty good, but if you do more than a coat or 2 at a time it takes FOREVER to dry. i was putting finger prints in the surface 2 days after spraying. other than that, it seems pretty good. It shrinks a LOT when it dries, so watch for shrink cracks in the surface and be sure to reapply evenly. it's hard to make this stuff drip, but dont push your luck."
4,Great Album,"Best album since the debut in 1981, but where are the 'B'sides for the re-release? This album only runs about 33 minutes and is begging for some extra tracks. I'll be waiting for another release with 'I Fought The Law' 'Two Of A Kind' and the live versions of 'Stray Cat Strut'(classic) and 'Runaway Boys'"
5,My kids favorite!,I love this album it is unusual and pretty. Beth has a soothing and beautiful voice and my two little girls won't go to bed without playing this CD. The combination of unheard of songs along with old favorites keeps it fresh and yet familiar. A great addition to your kid's musical library.
3,A bit thin on useful information,This book is great if all you are interested in is painting toy soldiers. If you want to know more about the German Armies of this period look elsewhere.
1,Don't waste your money,"If I could have rated it no stars or minus stars, I would have. I have used Ames products all my life, buying them at Ace Hardware stores. So imagine my surprise when I found an Ames axe for 15 bucks. It ain't an Ames; it's parent company Woodings-Verona's poor excuse for a tool. The casting is extremely rough (an understatement, and my axe had dings all over the head and nicks on the blade). The handle was so rough from a poor finishing job, that I knew I'd have blisters after a few swings. Poor workmanship, quality and appearance make the Woodings-Verona ""Ames"" axe only fit for the slag heap."
4,Why is this so expensive?,This book is selling for $27.99 at Barnes and Noble as of 2/24/04 - that's over $20 less than here!
4,"Almost all 12"" versions on this Unidisc volume....","But the biggest dissappointment for me was the ALBUM version of She Works Hard for the Money instead of the 12"" version. Tracks:1. she works hard for the money...donna summer (5:17)2. every breath you take...otis liggett (6:22)3. chains...bionic boogie (8:23)4. you sexy thing (the remix from the 80s)...hot chocolate (7:18)5. sure shot...tracy weber (5:28)6. don't stop the music...yarbrough & peoples (7:48)7. love buzz...voggue (7:19)8. i'm ready...kano (5:12)9. you dropped a bomb on me...gap band (5:10)10. shake it up...rod (6:03)11. disco stomp...bohannon (5:48)12. c'est la vie...robbie nevil (7:04)"
1,Please don't waste your money,"We bought this toaster a few months back and as a previous reveiwer said, it only toasts on one side. It also pops up spontaneously before the toasting has even started. Trying to use all four toasting slots? Forget it. When you depress one side, the other pops up! Now, after only a few months, it looks as if it is having electrical problems and may be shorting out. For safey, we are tossing it."
1,Dog Alert! Do NOT Buy!,"Never worked well to begin with, and stopped working completely less than 2 months after purchase. Try to find info on where to send it back for repair or replacement, and you'll discover that Toastmaster is a phantom company - there's no listing for a corporate headquarters anywhere on the appliance itself, just the info that it's made in China (of course). A waste of $20."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this toaster about 4 months ago and now it only browns my toast on one side on the highest setting! So I have to flip the bread over to get it toasted on both sides. Will never buy another Toastmaster product again.
1,Do not buy this toaster!,"I was given a Toastmaster toaster that blew out a couple years ago and then I found this thing on Amazon for 6 dollars or something...sounded good at the time but I don't think I even got 6 dollars worth of toasting out of it. It died too, it didn't blow out but it just won't work...now I have to go out and buy a real toaster. Toastmaster sucks."
1,PIECE OF JUNK- DO NOT BUY!!!,"My husband and I recieved this item as a wedding gift. Boy, do I ever regret putting this toaster on my wedding registry. Its horrible!! The toaster levels do not stay down, I have to hold them down for a minute before they stay. Also when things are done toasting they don't pop up all the way I have to push the lever back up to get whatever was in the toaster out. The toaster DOES NOT HEAT UP FOOD PROPERLY. I have to put it on the halfway setting to lightly toast a pop-tart... forget about putting a frozen pastry in it because it is still cold when it pops up, or tries to pop up!! This product looks really nice and being a brand from ""toastmaster"" you would think that this a top grade toaster. LOOKS CAN BE DECIEVING!! I will never buy another toastmaster product. I highly recommend not buying this, it is a piece of junk!!!"
2,"Looks good, Doesn't work well",The toaster had problems soon after I got it. The right toaster slots won't stay down. You have to hold the lever down to get them to toast. The left toaster slots will sometimes stay on even after the toast pops up.The apperance is very good. So as a piece of art it is fine but as a toaster look somewhere else.
1,Wish I Read Reviews Before Purchase,"This toaster is a joke. The right side (working alone) dries the bread, but doesn't toast it. If you re-toast, it burns it. The left side started smoking the first time I used it. I've used it twice. 2 disasters. What a waste of time and money. Where is their R&D department? Returning for refund and will not buy this manufacturer again. Too bad no option for ""minus stars"", I had to select 1 star to write this review - not my choice."
2,Not very reliable,"We have to turn the dial all the way up to get even a small amount of toasting with this toaster. Then we get to wait until it cools and do it again. I'm buying a new toaster today, and it won't be a Toastmaster."
5,Great Buy!!!!,I wasn't expecting much from this toaster being its sold for less than $20. I have had mine for over a year now and it was probably one of the greatest bargains I ever got. You can't ask for anyting more than a cheap reliable product. I use it basically every day and my bagels/tost are always done to my liking. Ive never ahd a problem with it. I reccommend this to anyone who finds it!
1,Waste of money even though it's cheap.,I bought this toaster yesterday and returned it the same day. It only toasts one side of the bread no matter what slot you put it in. It seems like toastmaster used to be a good company. Of course It seems like toastmaster used to be an american company.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"If you are looking for a book that is a guide for learning tarot. Or if you are just starting to learn tarot reading then this is NOT the book for you. This book only gives a brief history, descriptions and explanation(not very good ones) of the cards. This book in now way will help you become a better tarot reader. It would be better to buy the cards and read the little book that comes with the cards, it has the same information as the book. The cards are beautiful and lovely but the book has no real purpose, save your money, buy the cards but not the book!!"
1,Not worth it,"This book is useless. I agree with the other review in that there is nothing extra in this book that is not contained in the little white booklet that comes with the deck. I recommend ""Pictures from the Heart"" by Sandra A. Thomson. This book is worth the money, is interesting for beginners and more advanced tarot readers."
4,"Bring it back, I'm sorry I waited!","I received this machine from a friend long ago and thought it was pretty silly, it looks like a fiendish thingie, but one day I decided to have a laugh and got it out. To my astonishment this thing really works! From that day on, and I cook with a lot of garlic, I used it steadily and happily. Alas, it broke one tine but still worked pretty well then I broke a second tine and that was the end of it. I have had several products lately that were great products but have gone out of production. So strange because I have always believed that great products would be supported. Not the case. I would buy another in an instant but I gave it only 4 stars because it broke. Twice. I did not put it in the dishwasher either!"
1,General theory zero instruction,"I thought I was getting a DVD to help me train my dog. I now know the theory behind Dr. Dunbar's methods, but that's it. This DVD does not teach you how to train in a step by step fashion.Make your dog sit before you do anything for them, that's the main just of this video. Waste of money........"
2,Downer,"I had read a review in a book rating movies and it made it sound interesting. It is full of characters who do not seem to be interested in their own lives, so why would we. Unless you want to be depressed don't bother with this film."
2,apexpapa,I ordered this bandage to try wrapping around my mid section for some support but it was not a solution. It didn't stay in place and also really stretched too much to provide the support I was after. It didn't promise that it would be my answer but I thought it was worth a try. My error.
3,Write from experience!,"While Magellen writes a good description of the book, I found it useless because Magellen has never been to Australia and therefore has never used the book. Moreover, I can skim it myself to see if it will work for me. It would be much more helpful if reviewers actually have used a guidebook!"
2,I DON'T LIKE IT!,"This vacuum cleaner is not good!! It hardly sucks up anything! I used it on my room and it is so terrible that it makes me sad that I don't have a nice vacuum! I don't have anything against Eureka but this vacuum is bad!My mom bought a Hoover wind tunnel vacuum and it works just fine! I'm sure they try as hard as they can, but Eureka needs to make their vacuums just as good as the Hoover ones!"
3,Good while it lasted,Bought this a year ago and always cleaned the canister and foam filter after every use but a few months ago I noticed the suction wasn't as good as it used to be but it was still picking up most of the stuff from the carpet so I wasn't too bothered. But now it just rolls the excess carpet into balls instead of putting it in the canister and I can't use any of the tools. At this point I'm just going ti buy a new vac. Seems like I have to do that about every year now.
1,Very disappointed,"After reading the other reviews, most of which were positive, we bought the Eureka 5902. Took it out of the box, followed directions for assembly, plugged it in, it worked great for one sweep. Then the roller brush stopped turning. Checked the belt it was fine. Called Eureka, they had us try couple of things, which didn't work. Finally was told ""it must be broken""! We are going back to a Wind Tunnel. I'd like to add that Amazon was great to work with. Sent me a return label, notified me when they rec'd it, and when refund was processed. Very polite all the way through."
1,HEPA FILTER MY FOOT,"Had this vacuum cleaner for about 4 months before we started noticing that the room air seemed dustier everytime we used it. At first, I thought it was because of the gap of the housing where the electrical cord emerged from its housing. I took a closer look and behold, there is an half inch gap where the removable dust bin sits in the front of the machine. It is supposed to be airtight as evidenced by the rubber gasket that lies superior to the plastic basket. Nothing on the machine is broken - it just is poor quality control on the part of Eureka. By the way, the other reviewer is correct. They (Eureka customer service)do not answer their phones; you are put on an endless loop until, ultimately you are disconnected."
1,real junk,"Buy something else. First of all, it started out fine - had good suction, etc. There was only one flaw the dusting wand didn't work. It is supposed to charge and clean itself, but that only happens if you can keep the thing together, and I bet you can't. It doesn't take long for the power paw to stop working. Mine rotates so slowly if it touches anything it stops. The cleaner itself loses suction over time. The dust catcher is easy to empty, but don't forget to buy all the filters it needs. This is a poor choice."
1,Eureka is right.,"I looked around quite a bit, and thought I had bought the best vacuum for the money. Consumer reports liked it, so I bought it.I got the vacuum, pulled it out of the box, put it together, and it worked for about 60-90 seconds. The brush motor stopped working. Eureka was no help and neither was Amazon. It took over 2 weeks to get my money back. I bought a Hoover from Wal-Mart, and as much as that pains me, it has worked perfectly."
4,Great vacuum,I bought this vacuum after returning a $500 Dyson which seemed really poorly made for a $500 vacuum. I had a Eureka previously which had incredible sucking power. I have a dog with very short hair and its very difficult to get the hair out unless you have a powerful vacuum. This vacuum has AWESOME sucking power. The only downside is that its pretty heavy and has a small dirt canister. I dont have wall to wall carpets so it doesnt bother me but i can see that the small canister can be a problem for people who have a lot of carpets to clean.
2,The honeymoon is over!,"After burning through several ""cheap"" vacuums, I bought this product with confidence after my trepidation was eased by the great reviews. I bought this 10 months ago and now it is dead. I live in a house with wood floors and only used this to clean 4 of the rooms that had rugs. The suction was initially great and at first use I thought it was broken until I discovered that the trap was full (duh). That had me sold but after the last time I cleaned it out, it just died. I'm no dummy with fixing things but that is why I bought a ""good"" vacuum. Well, $200 in the trash!"
3,Eureka the Boss Upright Vacuum,"It has great suction with animal hair, but it is messy to empty the dirt catcher. It is a little heavy to carry up and down stairs."
2,Breaks after 6 months,"I wish we all had to write the length of time we have had this product. I can't believe others have run into the same problem I just had. I've had this vacuum 6 months. I loved it from day one. I could not believe all the dirt we were living on. I would vacuum, empty canister, vacuum, empty canister and loved that I was getting the job done. Then I went to vacuum the other day and it just doesn't seem to be working, at all. There is no suction and I feel as if I am just pushing the carpet around.. I am so sad and irritated that it has died after 6 months. So I'm off to Target to buy something else..."
2,J & J cotton rounds,"I was expecting these to leave less cotton residue. They were OK, but I'd rather keep looking for somthing that does not leave behind little white trails on my face."
4,Johnson & Johnson Non-Chlorine Bleached Pads are a ...,"Johnson & Johnson Non-Chlorine Bleached Pads are a nice addition to your toiletry supplies. They have a wonderful texture against the skin and are the perfect size for removing make-up or applying toner. They fuzz less than cotton balls -- leaving less lint. The packaging has a convenient drawstring closure to help keep little hands from dispensing them too freely. My son found them perfect to use as pretend pirate eye-patches. I didn't have to worry about chemical-laden fibers so close to his eye, as they're bleach free."
1,DEAD - DEAD - DEAD,"First one was dead on arrival. I really wanted one so I order a replacement. It was also dead on arrival. I don't have to be hit on the head more than twice, I gave up."
4,A Must have for anyone with More than 3 Computers.,"It took a Few Crashes, 3 Cases of dead drives while moving them from one OC to another before I discovered about the such called "" REMOVABLE IDE HARD DRIVE DRAWER >. it's a Surprise to me why every PC doesn't come with one of those standard."
2,"sorry, not all it's cracked up to be","As a snowboard instructor myself, I can say there are definitely much better books out there that approach the subject in a way that's more in sync with today's growing group of riders. The author tries to intellectualize snowboarding and the tone rings insincere. Let's face it, snowboarding isn't rocket science! Just get out there and ride."
5,"Strap in, tune in, and pipe out!!","This is a great book for someone beginning snowboarding or has intermediate experience. It has lots of excellent pictures, examples and takes you through all the basic moves through more advanced carving so that you get you down the mountain in one piece. It also provides a good overview of construction of boards and boots for purchasing information. It came in very handy prior to my trip to Jackson Hole Wyoming, some of the most extreme terrain anywhere."
2,Outdated,"This book is a bit outdated. One look at the cover and you will know. Snowboarders don't dress like that nowadays. They'll get beat up if they do! The book teaches the skid turn. Nowadays, carve is the way to go with the beautiful hourglass-shaped sidecut. Although skid turn is useful in really steep situations, it is not an efficient way to turn. I would look for more up-to-date books out there."
2,SNOWBOARD a guide for all boarders,"This book seems to be OK but for me is to old. If you considering buying snowboarding book by ""GO SNOWBOARD"" - this is 2006 issue with detailed instructions on DVD. It helped me a lot enter to snowboard."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was VERY disappointed with this book; or more appropriately, bookLET. Despite its title, there is only one quilt included in the book, the rest of the items are wearables, home dec, etc, none of which are actually quilted. The instructions are not very well written, either. I have a ton of old jeans to be made into a quilt, and there's really nothing here giving instructions on this. If you're looking for quilt ideas or instructions, look elsewhere. If you're looking for quick cheap ideas to decorate your jeans or create small projects, you MIGHT like this book."
2,Beware of Sony DVD burners!!!,"My Sony DVD drive is not even 2 years old and has now stopped working. For me to get it fixed, it will cost me $20 for them to troubleshoot it and $170 to fix it!!! That is more than it costs to buy a new burner. The warranty is only 1 year. Their customer service is also horrible if you ever have a problem. I just want to warn people before they go buying Sony computer products."
3,Compatible with Macintosh and PC computers - NOT!,"The description of the ""Features"" of this DVD burner states that it is ""...Compatible with Macintosh and PC computers"". After purchasing the drive from another vendor (who described it in a similar fashion), I found out from Sony technical. support that the drive is not compatible with Mac OS, only Windows. The Manuals were also for the incorrect model number (DRX-510), but Sony stated that there is no difference between the two drives, only the software.I have not tested the drive as of yet, because it was purchased for my sister, who uses only the Macintosh Operating System. Although the drive looks like a quality piece of equipment, I can only give it three stars because of the misinformation within the description."
1,Burns DVD's but not CD's,"DVD burning works fine, but it's unable to burn CD's. I get constant 'buffer underrun' messages. I'm using the latest firmware and software - but still no luck."
1,dvdr drx500ulx,"j'ai acheté un graveur externe de sony modéle drx500ulx, j'aimerai avoir le manuel en francais ,car celui que j'ai recu est en anglais.je voudrai savoir comment activer la vitesse de gravure car par le configuration actuel ,il set trés lent.je suis raccordé par un port usb"
5,Student Lab Manual for Physical Exam and Health Assessment,Very satisfied with manual- needed for course.
3,Not quite what I had hoped,It took a month of frustration before they came out with a patch that finally got things going for me. Once I burned my first DVD it took several tries before I finally figured out how to view the pictures with my DVD player.I wish they would add a feature to add narration. Also you are limited to only one music file to play in the background.
2,Great Idea......BUT too many bugs,"I had great hopes for this product when I first purchased it. The idea is great: the abilty to organize all your multimedia in one convenient place, burn it to a CD to watch on your computer, etc. However, I received error messages from the start...regarding page faults....shutting down the program unexpectedly, freezing while burning....even though I met all system requirements. I called support, who were no help. I gave the software a chance...returned it once hoping it was just a one time bug....no luck...Unfortunately, I'll be returning the second copy for the last time. Smartdisk is on the right track....just need to work the kinks out of it first!!!!"
1,Technical Fault?,"Film looks fascinating yet I cannot watch due to the fact the subtitles will not activate. Yes, they are offered. Yes, I toggle them to come on, yet... nothing.Quickly switch to another subtitled DVD and no problem.My Hellevator simply won't play nice."
4,"Not A Bad Anime, But....","This anime reminds me a bit of Karin, but I found it really got lost in the ending. It's not bad till then, but the ending just ruined it for me. I found myself wondering, ""How did we get here?"" and was not able to find an answer to that question. To that point it's not a bad series."
4,Praise for moon phase,"A great vampire action flick with a few suprising twists. From dual personalities to leecherous grandfathers to super paranormal phatographers who cant see ghost, this series has just about every thing you can think of.You"
1,Don't buy this!!,This thing is extremely uncomfortable and simply over-priced. It presses uncomfortably against the larynx and gets very hot. It's made of cheap foam and really doesn't do anything for an injured or tired neck. A small roll-up towel works better than this.
5,great book for NP nurse,"for nursing before started their job, cheap and very good condition, when u read this book will help u to know about regulation and other stuff"
5,Nurse Practitioner's Bus Practice and Legal Guide,"Excellent condition of book, speedy delivery, and a fantastic content within the book."
2,"No one actually says ""I'm sorry""!","This book is gorgeous. The illustrations will draw in child and adult alike. The emotions are portrayed honestly in a way children will easily identify.But why, for the love of Pete, can't the book end with an actual apology and resolution instead of an imagined one? The narrator, a little boy, sulks to himself ""If she were as sad as I am sad, here is what she would do"", namely say she's sorry, even though apparently the little boy SHOUTED at his friend first.I very nearly bought this book after skimming it at the bookstore, enchanted by the beautiful pictures. I thought my 4 year old could really use a model of an apology, but that's not what this book is. Thank goodnes I read it through carefully.I gave it two stars to acknowledge the incredible artwork, but I wish it were in a different book."
5,Loved Bambi,"Very pleased with the stuffed Fawn. My four-year old granddaughter named it Bambi the moment she saw it, and it receives lots of cuddles. Very adorable and nice quality. Very happy with purchase."
3,Worked well for my purposes...,"It is definitely a soft stuffed animal, and it's pretty cute. But I for a Halloween costume :) It worked great, and held up really well despite being ripped open."
5,A MUST READ FOR ANONE INTERESTED IN JIM BAKKER,JIM ALBERT DOES HIS HOME WORK...ABOUT FIVE YEARS...ABOUT TIME SOMEONE WROTE THIS BOOK.
1,"Good book, bad publisher","So many mistakes, typos and lost symbols - it is very awful edition for reading."
5,Never Stop To Wonder Why.....,"""I'm way down now, way down now.."", from the terrific opener, to the funky, rhythmic closer, ""Thank You World"", Karl Wallinger and Co. have never sounded more inspired. I've still got my original 1990 pressing of this pop/soul classic and it just gets better with time! While he's often been chided for wearing his influences on his sleeve (not unlike Lenny Kravitz), Wallinger knows his way around a great melody and can write indelible hooks with the best of them. ""Goodbye..."" has it's heart firmly planted in 90's politics, while it's sound is rooted in various decades of rock, pop, funk and soul with a little acoustic folk (""And I Fell Back Alone"") thrown in for good measure. My favorite track is the Prince-ly/Sly Stone-ish ""Ain't Gonna Come Till I'm Ready"", but on the whole this entire LP is very strong, there's simply not a dud in the bunch. A fun, funky and eclectic album that holds up well."
5,"""Not a Bad Cut On It!""","I had lost this CD in my divorce. I remember when it came out and the dj playing ""Put the Message in the Box"" said how it is rare to have a CD without a bad cut on it. ""Goodbye Jumbo"" is one of those CD. They were absolutely right. I am going to break open my wallet and buy the import version. I miss this CD badly. Haven't listened to this CD in over 6 years and still humming ""Way Down Now"" in my head."
4,Cool pics,"This book has some especially cool movie stills. I especially love the cover. However, I think they should have included more of the movie in the book."
1,The worst musician ever,"The so called ballad ""Living to love you"" is stolen from Celine Dion. But Sarah made a horrible thing out of a wonderful song.""From zero to hero"" glorifies suicide.This CD is musically and lyrically the worst one ever produced!"
4,She tells it like it REALLY IS!,"I read this book after having read the ""Book Seller of Kabul"" and was glad i did. Her true-life experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq give an insight into these people and why they have such a love/hate relationship with the American people."
5,Exceptional writing,"Asne Seierstad has managed to combine empathy, compassion, emotional attachment to the city and people of Baghdad with phenomenal objective reporting. Refreshing to read about the war from a non-US perspective. Highly recommended."
2,Read the back carefully,"In a rush I read the great reviews on the back of the book and thus decided to start reading this book but I soon realized the great reviews are not justified by this book. I took another look at the back and saw that the reviews are ment for the author's ""The Bookseller of Kabul"". If I had not been misled she might have gotten another star from me."
5,Awesome,This movie is really fun and much better than I had been led to expect. Definitely worth it for the Blu-ray version as well.
5,Two Thumbs Up!!!,"This movie is a great one for the whole family to watch. As with all Jackie Chan movies it has action, Comedy & in this one...A quirky romance. Definately a must see."
2,Re-run of The Pacifier,"Okay, so I'm not the proper demographic that the makers of ""The Spy Next Door"" were trying to impress - the children are grown and out of the house, and I really like foreign critically acclaimed movies. If you have children between the ages of 5 and 12, they may really like the movie. And if you have a soft spot for silly, harmless, action films with a few laughs thrown in, then by all means, this film is okay. However, I had the feeling the entire time I watched the film (to placate my wife) that I'd seen the exact same film before, only it was starring Vin Diesel and was called ""The Pacifier""."
4,Not the best Jackie Chan,"I enjoyed the movie, but it is not my usual forte. Would recommend it for children as it is not a violent movie at all, but a true comedy. Some martial arts, but they are done more as slap stick comedy."
4,Love Jackie Chan,"This one was just for me. My husband, 75yrs old, is not fond of any modern action films, no matter how funny they are. Jackie Chan's movies are always funny and entertaining for me. This was also a cute little romance."
2,"Silly, good for kids; Don't expect much of Jackie Chan's best","Pretty straightforward movie. Look at the cover -- that's what you'll get. By no means un-watchable, but really geared for a narrow age of children."
5,Ili,"Good movie to watch family and kids, my daughter liked it very much.she like fun movies.you can see this move with your little ones too."
5,Great family fun!,"This movie is an excellent family film. Not only does it have the trademark Jackie Chan action, but a heart-felt story to go along with the action and comedy. The bumbling ""bad guys"" make for some funny scenes too!"
1,It should have been rated R - contains incorrigible children,"I wouldn't let my kids watch this. It is offensive where a so called 'children"" show features 3 kids who talk back to her poor mum. I would slap my kids if they call me by my name in this case the girl who screams as at her mum using her name. And the boy has his ears plugged with an IPod while his mother talks to him. In Malaysia, this film is rated PG13. It should be R rated.With this release, Kick-Ass seems to be more suitable for kids! The girl loves her daddy."
4,Family fun,It starts off a little bit slow and speeds up with Jackie Chan Finesse. I always look forward to seeing new action scenes with Jackie and this lives up to it. The movie is a good for family viewing and goes to show you to never ever judge a person by their apperances alone. Also included at the end is the bloopers and I love those.
3,The Spy Next Door,I was a little disappointed in this DVD with Jackie Chan. It is suited to be seen by kids and is not truly up to Jackie Chan's usual action comedy fighting movies.
3,Hokey,"If I were to take the bloodless violence of Jackie Chan, the family profile of a 90's sitcom, add in villains like those seen in action movie spoofs, and glue it together with a plot straight out of James Bond, then you get this movie. Partly succumbing to some stereotypes, like the Chinese kung fu, while repudiating other stereotypes, like the Chinese man dating the American blonde, this movie is fun and funny to a limit. Some of the gadgets are original, and some of the fight scenes are hilarious, like the part with the biting turtle. But the overall movie is hokey as the different parts look like they were lifted from other movies. The only original part of this film was the fact that it takes in place in the suburban Southwest, instead of the usual NY, Chicago, LA or San Francisco. Overall, an OK addition to Jackie Chan's filmography, though a good outing for Billy Ray Cyrus."
4,great family film,"It is a clean, fun, entertaining movie to watch with the whole family. Other ""family"" films can tend to be filled with sexual inuendos or language that is inappropriate and unnecessary, this movie offers none of that. I'm grateful for this and other movies that don't need to use sex or language to try to sell their ""family"" movies."
4,Awesome,"Good movie, I just thought of this movie and I was like, ""Hey, I want the movie now!"" Really good movie but the acting is a little, ehh."
5,saves the back,Comfortable and good support. Holds alot of books.Convenient pockets. My brother and I have this backpack.
3,easy to read,"I do agree with some of the other reviews here, it is all covered in the manuals that come with Firewall-1. But who had an easy time reading them? Who has time to swap back and forth through the manuals trying to figure something out? If you have the money buy it and use them both. Start with this book which is easy to read and then go to the manuals."
1,Very disappointing book,The manuals supplied with FW-1 are not the greatest manuals I have read so I was eager to obtain a book dedicated to it. Unfortunately the book adds little to nothing more than can be gleaned from the FW-1 manuals. It is also far too NT specific. I'll just stick to the excellent resources available on the Internet.
1,This book is horrible,"This is the most useless computer security book I have ever seen. I found it to be mostly a bunch of screen shots with uninformative and vague explanations of the various buttons and/or choices. I keep looking for security recommendations and explanations related to the firewall configuration options, but never really found them. Don't buy this book for any reason - go to phoneboy.com instead."
2,Your not gonna pass your CCSA or CCSE with just this book...,"This book is more of an overview of the subject of Firewall-1... On nearly every other page the author refers to the Achitecture and Administration guide (which is on the Checkpoint CD) for a further explanation.... Do yourself a favor, save the money and read the guides on the CD."
1,What a disappointment,"This book is absolutely no use to you if you have acrobat reader. No added value here what so ever. No decent senarios or configurations. Off-putting that he ""uses 192.168 as a valid IP network"" -why? Why not use a valid one? One star is too much."
1,Not good...,"I'm a Checkpoint instructor and I can tell you this book is not worth the cost (period).There is very little Checkpoint documentation available anywhere (phoneboy.com/netflood.net are the best websites)... and I've seen answers ignored or inaccurately answered on the firewall-1 mailing list. You really are a lot better off going to a Checkpoint class at a national company like ISS or Exault. If you have a good instructor, you will learn little known facts and configurations, tips and techniques, and have a fairly strong understanding of Checkpoint Firewall-1. I may be biased because I am an instructor but I can tell you right now, that I was once a beginner and learned the software, what was valuable, and what wasn't, the hard way."
2,Should have been called 'Dummies guide to FW-1',"If you've ever worked with FW-1 (any version), or done any kind of firewall work, this isn't the book for you. If you're looking for general firewall information, get Designing Internet Firewalls, published by O'Reilly. This book, while being a very soft and easy introduction to FW-1 by the not-very-FW (or network) saavy individual, is just a re-write of FW-1's documentation, with so much omitted that it's not worth the read. Add a star, though, if you're just starting out, and you have no firewall experience."
1,Just as bad as the Checkpoint manuals,"I'm a Network Security Engineer who's been working with Checkpoint for about 3 years, and I ordered this book because I really wanted to master Checkpoint.The book is embarassing, I could have written a better book. There's little content other than the very basic tasks in Checkpoint, just a rehash of the manuals. It's geared torward the beginner but a beginner would be better off reading ""Building Internet Firewalls"" published by O'Reilly and ""Firewalls and Internet Security: Repelling the Wily Hacker"" by Bellovin and Cheswick before reading this garbage.If you need info on Checkpoint, check out Phone Boy's Checkpoint site or join the Firewall-1 mailing list!"
1,Little added value if you have Check Point's documentation.,"If you already have the documentation set from Check Point, you will not find too much information not covered by Check Point's documentation set. I was expecting this book to complement the documentation, but found that it is very similar to the documentation you can obtain directly from Check Point. Chapter 13, the last chapter, does cover advanced firewall security topics not covered by the Check Point's documentation. Appendix A and B cover basic TCP/IP protocols. However, if you have the documentation set, these extra sections do not justify the cost of the book.If you are looking for one book to cover Check Point Firewall-1 basics, this one will do. If you already have Check Point's documentation set, I don't believe this book will add any new or insightful information."
5,Tres chaude!!,"It was a hot night in Paris and in the Olympia theater Patrica Kaas was even hotter! This is my favorite album and it's a two CD set. For anyone into Patrica Kaas, this is a must have. I wish they had a video of this show."
1,Do your research,Look at your other options. The 331-M is less expensive and has more memory. It is a newer version.
5,I'm happy he released it,"First of all, I admit that I don't own a single Drive By Truckers CD--something I plan on taking care of. I bought this CD on a whim after listening to clips of ""Uncle Disney"" and ""Rising Son"" and being very impressed. When I was able to listen to the complete CD, I immediatly fell in love.This CD could have easily been cleaned up but, thankfully, it remains beautifully lo-fi and raw. From creaking chairs to string noise to the occasional off-key lyric, KILLERS AND STARS is a brutally honest recording even if you choose to ignore the intelligent songwriting. Hood's voice embodies each song like a backporch storyteller revealing more character with each note.This is a real folk album done right. I wouldn't change a thing."
5,Years in the making...,"It took Patterson years to finally record and release this album...and while most musicians would succumb to the urge to ""over-polish"" older material, Patterson did not. The songs are raw and masterfully played as if all of those memories were fresh in his mind. Patterson is truly one of the greats, not only of his genre, but in all music."
5,A Great Way to Play Sudoku,"If you like to play Sudoku, then you need to buy this product. The box is about as thick as a regular deck of playing cards and is roughly 3.5 by 5 inches square. It is oh so easy to throw the box in a computer bag, backpack or purse. The games are printed on cardstock that is tough enough to withstand erasures. I like the fact that I can take one card out of the box, close the box, and then use the box as a hard surface to write on making it something I can play anywhere. And unlike books, you don't have to worry about having to bend the spine so you can write in all the boxes. The boxes are big enough to write in trial numbers without being huge.So, don't delay, buy several on them today."
4,The card game label is misleading,"This is not a card game, but in reality is about 100 puzzles which can be worked on individually.I ""do sudoku"" and I love it. It's a challenge."
2,Buyer Beware - Product Size Does Not Futuro's List,"Sizes from Futuro.com website -Small - beige 10.0-12.5 in.Medium - beige 12.5-15.0 in.Large - beige 15.0-17.3 in.Do your homework before buying!Please note, I think the product is excellent, but wonder about the information on Amazon."
5,AWESOME - Kids love it!!!!,We recently received this as a gift and we absolutely love it!! We were looking to buy something for our kids to listen to in the car and this came at the perfect time. Our 3 1/2 yr old daughter loves it too. There are songs for older kids as well as songs for toddlers. The four disc set includes educational songs as well as classics. Our daughter requests that we put it on as soon as we get into the car. It's great for a long trips too.
4,Review - Showing Up!,"This is a wonderful book with an understandable plan for knowing yourself and improving your life as a result. Very interesting, including references to various ancient religions and cultures, extracting ancient wisdom for modern use. A very quick and worthwhile read."
5,Unbelievably Good,"We live in the Pacific Northwest and bought these to help in cleaning Dungeness crabs. Instead of cracking the crab legs, we just cut them with these incredible scissors. They have a thin enough edge to get into even the smallest leg, yet are strong enough to not bend or break. Obviously, they can be used for other simpler cutting chores, but cutting a tough crab or lobster shell demonstrates how incredibly good they are."
3,Okay Action Adventure,"If Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Alone in the Dark, and Eternal Darkness are games of your fancy, you'll definitely want to look out for Kuon."
4,"A bit derivative, but over all a very satisfying and scary","Kuon is a true diamond in the rough. It was barely noticed in the American market, but is a more than worthy entry the survival horror genre. It's a lot like Fatal Frame in atmosphere. One of its more interesting aspects is your ability to play as three different in different yet interlocking storylines to unlock the mystery of Kuon. On the downside, it has many more load points than it should, and while the loading time is only about 6 seconds, it really breaks up the flow of play. I also thought that it was odd that the character's mouths don't move when they speak.Inany case, though, definitely worth buying if you're a fan of Fatal Frame, Silent Hill, and/or Resident Evil."
4,the pretender,I have bought the first to seasons of the oretender and enjoyed them with much delight. I looked everywhere for seasons three and four. And i knew that I needed to go no more than Amazom.com to find it. Seasons three and four was better than the first two. Myself and my husband are hooked. So much that when i ordered 3 & 4 I also ordered the movie set for the program. I think that we need more good entertainment on T.V. like this program other then another reality show.Thank YouJCM
4,Jared the Pretender,"Jared continues to pretend to be anything he wants. However, in the latter part of the season, the focus is not on him finding his parents, but rather trying not to get caught. What happened to his father that he meets in the first part of the season?"
2,Great Series; Horrible Disc,"Sorry guys, I love Prentender just as much as the rest of you--in fact I have bought all four seasons plus the movies. Unfortunately, the discs are ALL defective. At least in seasons 1 and 2 I could still play them on my computer, but season 3 Disc 1 side 1, last episode (I believe it is ""Someone to Trust"") would not play on either of my DVD players nor my computer. Extremely poor quality. I am not the only one complaining about this either--look at reviews on other seasons."
4,"Here's the episodes, the end.",I was quite a fan of this show when it first aired. It would have been nice to have more special features but maybe they didn't have anything to offer.
2,Pretender,loved the show ... half of the disc were scratched and unviewable ... returned and got another and it was the same way
5,He's everything Else Ive seen and More,Miss Parker starts to look into more of her mothers death. Thomas wants Miss Parker to move. Miss Parker says she is leaveing the Centre. Miss Parker also tries to prevent a quick marriage from happening. She also starts to see all the lies unraveling before her very eyes. Jarod on the other hand gets involved with Argyle which I think is a big mistake. Broots and Jarod team together to find some evil guy named Damon. Also some guy named Mr.Lee hes some asian guy. Who is looking for Jarod in a very bad bad way.
5,Great Show,This show was one of my favorites to watch on tv when it was on. I have the whole series on DVD and i can watch it anytime i want. Highly recommend if you want something new to watch.
3,good series,I loved this series when it was first on tv and hubby wanted to see it again so I bought the entire series through Amazon and we thoroughly enjoyed it. How many times have I wished I could be someone else! lol It's fun to pretend!
3,Just ok,"I was dissatisfied with this book by Amanda Grange. Her 'Darcy's Diary' was very well written, though this might be because the plot was laid out before she even started writing. The characters just don't seem to be well written and are very unbelieveable. Oliver doesn't have any attraction for the girl and thinks that she is plain, but rather sees her as a challenge since he overhears that she will never marry him for the inheritance money. Plus, I fail to believe that she is so naive as to believe some of the explanations given to her. Like the previous reviewer said, there are quite a lot of plot holes and bad character development. Buy this book on sale, but don't waste your money otherwise."
2,Slow with moments of above average writing,"This is the second book written by Amanda Grange I've attempted. I couldn't complete the first and barely got through this one. Her writing when describing an atmosphere based on nature is good but her plot is repetitive and boring.I hope her skills have improved but doubt I'll attempt her again. It's sad when you're reading a book for pleasure and all you can think of is ""how soon will the be over?"""
2,Cover Misleading,This is not a Regency (picture on the cover). It is a Georgian romance and not a very good one. Certainly not worth the price for a trade paperback!
2,Not very helpful,"This book is so basic and limited that it's really not all that useful. The entries are EXTREMELY brief (a paragraph or two) for most topics - which means that I can't imagine anybody really using this book as a reference without another book to back it up.Maybe if you're just looking for a very basic, quick read, it might be useful. But in general it's pretty lacking."
2,The Headache Prevention Cookbook,"It is a good book to read, but unfortunately for me, most of the recipes have migraine triggers and I can't eat the foods"
3,Disappointed with the content,"There are some really good recipes in the book but I was disappointed that so many recipes contain foods believed to be migraine triggers in them. If you are trying to restrict your diet completely from migraine triggers, most of the recipes will not meet your needs without many modifications."
1,What about vegetarians?!,"As a vegetarian, I knew I was taking a chance with this title. However, I had just committed to Dr. Buchholz's 1-2-3 Program for healing headaches & was eager to try it out. Needless to say, being a vegetarian isn't a good fit and sooo many of the recipes in the book contained the triggers I was supposed to avoid. Very disappointed!"
1,Not the one shown in picture,"I have looked for this item all around, I don't know if ACE does not make it anymore or what, but when I found here I was happy. Well it is not what you get, unless I received a wrong product unintentionally. Not happy!"
1,Worst Ankle Brace Ever,"This ankle brace is pointless. It does nothing to brace the ankle in any way, shape, or form. The thing straps onto your ankle and foot but provides ZERO additional support. I was better off putting on a second pair of socks than I was using this dreadful thing. DO NOT waste your money."
3,Charming Book for Parents,"The book is small with wonderful watercolors of animal faces. Wish sayings had more thought and originality. Liked a similar book by the same author better, ""Furry Logic,"" but does not have the parenthood theme. Some of the pages were duplicated in the Furry Logic book."
5,Logical and beautiful,"I love the Furry Logic books. Quotes are right on, I don't think these are children's books, although it wouldn't hurt them to learn and discuss these lessons. The art is fantastic. Every time I look at them, I picture the artist painting them with a 1-hair brush at a time. I order almost all my books for Kindle, but these are the exception. I want to pick them up and look at them, these and recipe books."
2,Great except...,"for the humping ladybugs. I was planning to give this to a pregnant friend of mine, but I was turned off by the ladybug page."
1,Jaron Lanier is good PhD material,"This guy talks like a PhD. He puts words and sentences together very well that mean little or nothing. He makes up ideas and concepts that sound impressive on the surface but have very little or no substance, based on very simple concepts in reality. Gets the word count up good. If he's not a PhD he should be. This guy is dumb. Except he makes a lot more money than me."
1,Stupid Book,"This is nothing but a travelogue of Italy (a poor one at that!) and some copy/paste from 'Italian for Dummies' book, and copy/paste from amazon's listing of a Wireless Phone/PDA device , wrapped in a hint of plot, I cant comprehend how John Grisham has become a best selling writer"
1,IRS Audit,"Mr Grisham:I'm from the IRS......how can you justify all these deductions for your trip to Italy? Ans: Have you read my book? Its all about Italy, research,you know. What a bore. Grisham has reached a diminishing return point and is living (big time living)off his reputation. Save your money and buy a travel guide to Italy."
1,Is that it?,"I was very disappointed in this book. I'm a big fan of Grisham's earlier books and had hoped The Broker would be as exciting. I kept reading and reading and reading, waiting for something to happen. I thought, surely the ending will bring it all together - wrong! What ending??? Read this book if you want a vivid description of Bolonga, Italy and Italian language lessons."
5,another winner,"The story is very well written and suspenseful. It kept me going when I should of been studying for my test. It has everything you look for in a novel; informative, intrigue, very interesting characters, conflict, rising tension, and a great climax. Just a great book."
3,I agree with the others.....,"This is not Grisham's best work. He spends way too much time discussing language lessons, and there's not a lot of suspense. He should stick to writing legal thrillers set in Mississippi."
2,I miss the first few books that he wrote...,"This book is just like the last few books have been. Disappointing! I always wait for Grisham books in anticipation. I loved ""A Time to Kill"", and ""The Firm"", this doesn't come close. I really hope that Grisham starts taking the time to write the masterpiece that he truly is capable of, and not these hollywood movie scripts."
2,Where's the beef?,"I've always heard that description, explication and dialogue are, in some way, supposed to move the plot along. But, in this case, the dialogue is, basically, a guy learning to speak Italian (which is then translated into English so that the reader knows what is being said) while the description and explication sound like something lifted from the pages of a travel book. Meanwhile, the plot is barely moving and the suspense is more about WHEN will something happen than WHAT will happen. Sorry, Mr. G., this isn't your best."
2,Okay Book. Great writer - okay story,I was entertained until the end when I closed the book and was still waiting for something to happen. Not one of his best. I was not ewen overly inspired to see Bologna.
2,DISAPPOINTING,"After reading the first 75, or so pages, I thought to myselfGrisham is back. What followed was a lesson in Italian,a travelouge of two Italian cities, and how to order in anItalian cafe. In movies, they call it ""chewing up the scenery.The last 40 pages were written in a hurry to end the tale.No exceptional page turning during the novel. If I were tocompare this book to ""The Firm"", I'd only give it a half star."
2,A Bunch of Bologna,"Unlike many other reviewers, I felt as if most of the Broker lacked the energy that drives so many of Grisham's other novels. Much of the book is dominated by lectures in Italian language and culture. I was not excited by the tours of Bologna and it's numerous coffee shops. It was as if I were watching homes movies of a relative's recent Christmas vacation to Italy. The overall plot of the story was good, but one must overlook 75% of the book to get to the plot and chase. I personally was disappointed and often had no trouble putting the book down."
1,A good travel guide to Italy,"I haven't read a Grisham novel in several years because the last book I read was a disappointment. My mother gave me this book for Christmas so I thought I give him another try. I couldn't believe how boring and shallow the book was. The book functions better as a language, restuarant or travel guide. It is unbelievable how much print Girsham dedicated to Italian language lessons, eating out and visiting historical sights. It cured me of ever wanting to read him again."
4,An Enjoyable Holiday Read,"From cover to cover The Broker was a quick, enjoyable read.Pros:The storyline was entertaining from beginning to end. The transformation of Joel Bachman to Marco back to Joel was excellent. Grisham did an excellent job of keeping this from becoming a ""James Bond"" spy novel and instead kept it as a story about a man on the run.Cons:There were a lot of loose ends. Chapters were dedicated to what seemed like a promising route (Sammy Tin or the Morgan scandal) that were subsequently dropped with no explanation.On the whole, its a quick read. I read it in about a day and a half. I'd highly recommend it."
2,Not your usual Grisham book,"I just finished this book and although the end picked up, the real action didn't start until the 19th chapter (page 226 of 419). The plot meandered as though Grisham was struggling to come up with a good story. He pulled it off in the end (because he IS a good writer), however the writing was still under par for his experience. For example, the give-n-take between the story's star Joel Backman and his son was almost laughable: ""Sure, Dad. I hope you know what you're doing."" ""Just cutting a deal, son. Like in the old days."" - come on?!"
2,A bit disappointing,"The plot idea for this story was very interesting. I expected a thriller where the plot truly moves along. John Grisham spent more time writing about the culture of Italy instead of the plot. If you are reading the book for the thrill of the chase, then this is not the book for you. If you like reading about a country's culture, then you will truly enjoy this book. Although I was disappointed, I still had to read it to find out what happens to the main character. John Grisham still has the flair to draw in the reader."
2,Lonely Planet for Bolonga?,There is nothing thrilling about this book. Tour of bolonga streets for most part of the book. The story started off well but then got really boring from middle to end. I wish i head read reviews before buying this one.
2,"Good for learning some Italian, sloppy as a novel.","Grisham, who apparently was trying to impress readers with his knowledge of Italian and cell phone technology, created a boring, far-fetched novel with an ""undeveloped"" main character, and threw in a pot others so that it at least looks like he did some literary work. The novel is a complete disaster. Italy gets a star and a cell phone gets another one."
1,Disappointment #9,"So formulaic. See, what you do is travel to Italy on the riches of your last book, dream up a half-baked plot, insert tour trivia, study a few maps, blast the keys for a few days, and submit to publisher. Yeesh, I'm tired of established authors doing this. Grisham ought to be spanked--no, held hostage in a drab, cramped hotel room in Milano and forced to drink cappuccino after noon. His Italian lesson stints are BORing, the main character draws no sympathy--ever, the agents are one-dimensional, and the idea that a power broker of his ilk can't outwit his snoop handlers in the first 20 pages had me wondering whether this guy maybe did go a little crazy in stir. Save your money and your precious reading hours. You want Italian, go Berlitz."
1,So boring I couldn't finish it,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. If I'd wanted to learn to speak Italian, I'd have taken a course at the community college. It was boring with no mystery I could see. Halfway through it, I realized I had better things to do with my time, read the last two chapters, and gave it away to someone I don't really care for."
1,An utter waste of time... (like most things regarding Washington DC),"Pointless and stupid to the max. Perhaps a great story teller without a story,is the only excuse I can fathom for this complete and total waste of time."
2,Nothing happens,"The only thing saving this book from one star is that it isn't illiterate or annoying. . . just boring. Had I not lost my book to read on a long plane trip, I would not have bothered with it.Come to think of it, the Skymall Catalog would have been more interesting.The reviewer who said this was an excuse to write off a long Italian vacation has it nailed."
1,terrible,"Most of the book is about learning Italian and food. Not joking. If you read the book, you may learn how to say something in Italian, probably something food-related."
1,"Poor, poor, poor!","It is not Grisham I admired and enjoyed to read in his first three novels. It is someone else, but who? Yes, who is the writer, what's his real name? Maybe it's an advetising agent from Bologna, Italy, posing as John Grisham, an impersonator? A fat Italian chef-turned novelist?? A tourist guide-turned novelist??? Or maybe it's that girl who likes to borrow sentences from other authors' books... Nooo. Ha, I've got it! It's that greedy, sneaky Mr. Publisher capitalising on a good author's name again. It's that smell of green that buys appearances--yachts, palaces--I don't want to say what else... But, whatever, this one is a waste of words, and paper, and green..."
2,An Italian language lesson,"I have not read the books that made Grisham famous. In fact this is the first full-length book of his I have read. In short, I do not find the book compelling. This is John Grisham's first spy novel and it has received mostly positive reviews, with which I do not agree. Washington power broker Joel Backman, who holds the secret to a sophisticated spy satellite system, is on the run for his life and at least 4 countries and the CIA want him dead. The first half of the book details Backman's two months hiding in Italy. This part moves at a very languid pace and about all you get out of it is an extensive Italian language lesson and an in depth of tour of the city of Bologna. The second half of the book moves faster, but peters out to a disappointing finish. You feel the author is just trying to quickly finish the book and put the reader out of his misery. If you want to read Grisham, I recommend you stick to Grisham's legal thrillers."
2,The very crux of the plot makes zero sense,"The CIA convinces the President to pardon this guy, just so they can watch to see which country kills him so that they can ""learn"" something.WTF?!?!?*** Spoilers, but read on anyway because you don't want to read this book anyway ***Well, after leaking the location of this guy to every country he's had dealings with it seems like they ALL show up to kill him and ultimately NOTHING is learned about anyone's motives, and in fact it appears that there WAS nothing to learn. It doesn't make any sense.I'm guessing Grisham phoned this one in. I bet it took him a month or so to write, tops.But, if you can live with a story that, at its core, ultimately doesn't make sense, then it will help you pass a few hours while waiting for a plane."
3,A decent read that doesn't live up to Grisham's standards!,"The Broker, although taking place in Washington at times, is not a legal thriller. Its more of a spy novel. Or is it an Italian tour guide and langauge lesson? That's where my somehwat dislike of this novel comes in. It seems a third of the tale is spent teaching both the main character and the reader Italian. Overkill doesn't begin to explain it. And that main character is somewhat hard to like given his past misdeeds. Overall, just another average read."
1,Couldn't pick it up,"Normally I love to read John Grisham's books and usually find that I can't put them down. With The Broker, I found that I ""couldn't pick it up."" I ultimately finished it but the first 90% was slow, repetitive and without much story or action. There was a brief flurry towards the end when it got interesting then the actual ending was abrupt and bland. There are many better books to read despite the Grisham name."
1,Goes no where fast,"I have loved all of John Grisham's books. That's why this one is so dissapointing. This book spends 3/4s of it's time telling us how the main character learns Italian. 1/5th of the time describing italian food, resturants, and sights. And almost no time in any interesting plot at all. All I can think is Grisham went to Italy. Wrote an intricate diary of what he saw. And then decided to bore us with a recounting of every darn detailof it. Oh well, I'm still looking forward to his next one. Everyone is entitled to a mis-step every now and then."
2,Everything Anyone Wanted To Know About Italy,"I was told this is Grisham's ""come back"" book, and that was the only reason I decided to read it. This book was a huge disappoint. It starts off pretty much like Grisham's more exciting books, and quickly devolves into a badly written Italian travelogue. If you want to learn all about Bologna, get this book!! If you want to learn Italian, get this book!!! If you want a ""edge of the seat"" thriller, go somewhere else and save your money."
2,What the #*&$@!,"Ok this book is great if you are visiting Italy soon and want a brief glimpse into the beautiful country. If you are looking for a fast paced, thriller of a book - keep looking !!! The book just STOPED. It is like Grisham realized his deadline was close and just wrapped up the book in a couple of minutes without much thought. I am glad I borrowed this book and did not waste my money on actually purchasing it."
2,Doesn't go where you might think,"This novel starts out promising enough, but it reaches a point where, for those familiar with Grisham, you think you might figure out where it will head. Unfortunately in this case, Grisham lost his own formula. The book spends a great deal of time with the protagonist's Italian studies, whereas this could have been dealt with in a much more expedient manner.Is it just me, or did any other reader think that Backman might have figured out that he was being bugged and surveilled? Maybe searched through his clothing and found something? I really was really expecting more of a ""Client"" type of story, where the hero gains the upper hand. This book was compelling enough to finish, but disappointing in the outcome. All momentum from the novel was lost with the turn of a single page.Disappointing."
1,Boring,"I have read most of Grisham's books and up to this book found them to be enjoyable to varying degrees. As I read this book, I kept feeling as though he was trying to fill up the pages with Italian to English translations. That he had to get a book out by a certain date and only had a weak plot. Truly disappointing!"
1,Italian 101?,"I have been a big Grisham fan since The Firm, but this is his worst book since The Chamber. If you are interested in learning Italian, by all means buy this book, otherwise buy something else."
3,Ho Hum,"Didn't draw me in like Grisham's novels normally do. I thought it was well written, I just didn't get attached to the characters and the plot didn't excite me."
3,so-so and ho-hum,"Grisham's prose is spare and succinct, so the pace isn't really that slow, but nothing much happens in this book. If I hadn't been to Italy and consequently been mildly interested in the descriptions of Italian cities and customs, I wouldn't have finished the book. I kept hoping for a neat plot twist at the end, but it was pretty pedestrian. To top it off, Grisham added a note at the end admitting that he knows very little about spy satellites, computers, or the other techie stuff he included. Clearly, his heart wasn't in writing this one. I tend to agree with the other readers who speculate he needed a way to write off his Italian vacation."
3,Yawn,"Overall comments:Hard to care about the character because he is not well developed,wonder why he was relocated to Italy when he could have been moved to Canada or else where for a lot less expense to the govt.; ending ambiguous, felt Grisham ended it that way for a movie sequel and not for the reader. I expected a better book."
3,"Decent, But Not His Best Work","I've enjoyed Grisham for a long time and I haven't yet found one of his books that I don't like. I was, however, a little disappointed in this effort. It was tough to have sympathy for Joel Backman especially since his character was not well established. The story started out somewhat quickly, but once Backman arrived in Italy, the book seemed to be an excuse for Grisham to go to Italy and do ""research"" for the book rather than using the country to help tell the story. Few supporting characters made this even slower at times, and I found myself wondering where it was all going.All in all worth the (paperback) read, but keep your expectations in check."
2,Not as good as The Last Juror,"I was so pleased after reading The Last Juror, Mr. Grisham's previous novel. I felt he was returning to the excellent storytelling he exhibited in A Time to Kill & The Firm. Unfortunately, The Broker does not live up to this promise. It seemed to move very slowly for much of the book. I kept waiting for something to happen and then realized I only had 40 pages to read yet and still nothing had really happened! I felt no sympathy for the main character nor for his plight, as he was being hunted down by everyone and their cousin. He wasn't a very nice man and I didn't find any real revelation in his character that would indicate he had made some sort of turnaround. I found myself sympathasizing more for Luigi, the main character's ""handler"" and for Teddy Maynard, the CIA head, than for the main character. I hope Mr. Grisham's next book shows more promise and has more of an interesting story line."
2,Stinker,"If you like Grisham, read ""The Last Juror"". It is a much better read. If you want an Italian lesson, read ""The Broker"". This book didn't have a plot until three-quarters through. If you thought ""The Street Lawyer"" was weak, this fare is even worse."
2,Do you want to learn Italian?,If you want to learn Italian or you want a guided tour of northern Italy read this book. Otherwise skip it.
2,his stream ran out,I read all of his books and enjoyed all of them including the bleacher unlike some saying it's a deviation. Either he got lazy from his success and money or he lost his touch finally and unfortunately. The book reads as if it's written by some assistant of his trying hard to be Grisham but not quite. Something is missing. Why so much tourism? Was it sponsored by the Italian bureau of tourism? I know it was necessary but he was overly impressed by his visit to Italy. What about the ending? Pathetic. These days a mere million doesn't cut anything. I'll still read his next book hoping it would be much better than this one.
2,Thriller? I think not,"Okay so I thought I was purchasing an intense thriller about a man who is given a second chance with a presidential pardon and then finds himself running from the most dangerous hitmen in the world. Boy was I surprised when the story consisted of Joel Blackman walking around and enjoying the citys of Italy and learning the language.John Grisham does a good job in developing the character of Joel Blackman, but when it comes to plot this novel has nothing. Grisham takes a chapter to describe hitmen that you expect will be trying to kill Blackman, but these hitmen don't even come into the story.The ending was kind of lame, too. Grisham leaves you with the plot only somewhat resolved."
2,"Light reading, 357 pages of a flimsy Travel Guide Plot!","Frommer's guide to Italy may be more interesting.Definitely not his best work.It was light, quick reading though, and with the dark, rainy day on 04/23/05 in Boston, I breezed thru the book in a few hours.I gave it 2 stars coz I finally know that I should not order capuccino after 10:30 AM! Hah!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Only because it was written by Grisham did I labor through this book to hopefully become consumed by a suspenseful denouement. Unfortunately, Grisham suffers from the same malady as James Patterson in his book, London Bridges wherein both authors take the easy way out leaving many loopholes and unanswered questions. In particular, we are told of a Chinese assassin who is pursuing the lead character but the story ends without any mention of the assassin. The ending is much too contrived for my liking and doesn't justify the attempt at Italian language lessons (talk about boring). Perhaps the book's only redeeming quality is that it makes one want to travel to Italy to enjoy the wonderful food."
3,"Entertaining, yet feeble",I got this book as a gift and thank goodness for that; it's just not worth buying! The story is simply bogus and it kinda goes backwards: you expect an outcome and the story just tries to build up to that outcome. There's very little in this book that could be considered interesting and the ending provides no closure whatsoever. This is my first John Grisham book and I have to say that I'm somewhat disappointed. I was expecting a full-fledged lawyer story with some tension and courtroom drama but there was none to be found. I recommend you pass on this one and get something else. I'll be keeping my hands off Grisham's book for a while...
4,Another good read,Grisham is up to par with this book. Depth of character takes you from despising the bad guy to thinking he's not really that awful after all - he becomes just a regular man with upscale tastes and high level intelligance mixed up in a very dangerous situation. The story brings legal and political maneuvering to a high point that an everyday citizen can understand. An interesting page turner.
3,just normal novel,"just 10 years ago I received a gift, Grisham's novel ""runaway jury"". at that time, i was so excited. and then i was fallen in love with grisham's novel. but ""the broker"" doesn't look like grisham's novel. i don't know why i feel like this. just i think, maybe i expected there is something new story related law and policy of United states. because i like relating law stuffs. anyway this book is like just normal suspence story. a few intrigue, new place such as italy and revenge...^^;i just can say if you open the first page, you could read this for just a few hours. it's page turner."
3,"Weak ending, but fun read","What has made this book popular is its touch of Italy and the anxiety build up as secrets unfold. The last couple of chapters are very simple and everyone I know who read the book has felt disappointed by them. I can't help but wonder if Mr. Grisham didn't run out of time and slapped something together to meet a printing date, what a shame! If you read the first chapter you will be hooked. Enjoy the ride, but don't expect a great ending. If you have been to Italy, or have ever thought of going (and love mysteries) you will enjoy the book."
3,Didn't live up to Grisham's other classics,"I just finished this one today, and I'd say it definately kept me turning the pages, but it wasn't too great compared to Grisham's other stuff. The Testament, The Chamber, and most of his other ones surpassed this one by far. The first few chapters were extremely dull, and I was glad to get through them and read on to see where Joel/Marco would end up. The parts I probably liked most about this one were the great descriptions of Bologna and the cafes and such. Also, the I loved the Italian, being the language nut that I am, and after reading this book I think I'd consider learning it sometime. Although Grisham probably didn't intend to write a guidebook for Bologna, he did - one could probably enjoy a great vacation just from reading it - all the best cafes, the sights to see, and basic Italian. The plot wasn't as thrilling, rather mediochre, and the characters were a bit too unbelievable. Don't expect Grisham's usual great stuff; this one is just average."
1,A Struggle to Read,"As previous disappointed readers before me have stated, (for a summary of the plot any one of the 500+ descriptions from reviews prior to mine will do) The Broker was not John Grisham's best work by a long shot. The story was flat and definitely not a legal thriller and the ending was boring. I struggled to finish the novel, hoping it would somehow get better toward the end of the story, sadly, that was not the case."
1,excruciatingly boring,The novel is terribly disappointing. The chase is perfunctory and implausible. Most of the novel is padding about learning Italian in Italy.
3,"Not his best, but good","I not only like Grisham's books, but I admire Grisham. He doesn't manipulate his readers with the sleaze, sex and gore other writers of thrillers seem to think is requisite to a good story. Grisham's books always have a point, which is up to the reader to devine and appreciate, or not. While I think he got off to a good start with this one, and had a few inventive twists going at times, it almost seemed as though he just gave out at some point and got tired of writing. All his elaborate setup just collapsed. I had my mouth open near the end, thinking, ""That's it? But...."" Still, I don't regret a minute I spent reading the book and will buy his next one hot off the press."
3,It sounds lovely anyway,"Reading this book, I got the distinct impression John Grisham just got back from a trip to Italy and instead of writing a postcard decided to plunk out a novel. Once upon a time I was a big JG fan; even got his autograph on The Runaway Jury. But I got tired of his formulaic writing. At least with The Broker he veers in a new direction, but the plot isn't particulary exciting and seems incidental to the celebration of all things Italian. Since I listened to the audiobook version, I enjoyed the Italian lessons - such a beautiful language - but I would've been bored reading word after Italian word on the page."
1,Was disappointed,"I bought the hard cover book as I was expecting to read a good story. There are a lot of interesting descriptions of Bologna, Italy and that I enjoyed. BUT,the ending was stupid! There are several loose ends in the story and when I read the last page I thought there must be more, there HAD to be more, but there wasn't. I was really ticked off and I felt as though I had been cheated. Did he write this for a movie screenplay and the screenwriter will fill in the blanks? I agree with the reviewer that said several of our bestselling authors have been writing mediocre novels in recent years."
1,Save Your Money,Too many holes - slow paced - hard to believe this is written by such a talented author. Didn't buy this for lessons in Italian or travelogue. Big disappointment.
2,ONLY RESEARCHED ITALY,"I have read every book Grisham has written and this one falls far short of his usual fast-paced, engrossing tales. He researched Italy and Bologna, no doubt, but little else. He admits in the Epilog he does not understand computers, and it shows. Further, he has the DIA reporting to the CIA which simply is not, and has never been, true. Most absurd of all, he has a 60-year-old Army major the head of DIA. I thought at first it was a typo for Major General but, no, Major was repeated many times. A tad of research beyond Italy would show some respect for his readers."
1,Italian 101 - not a novel,"After hundreds of pages of Italian conversations about coffee, churches, bistros and famiglia, which Grisham religiously translates to English in some misguided attempt to teach the reader some basic language skills, I just got so bored and fed up that I recycled the book. Good riddance."
2,Honestly!!,"For a temporary descent into a fast paced five & dime, I usually like Grisham. I really felt cheated though. Too much of the book reads like a travelogue of Bologna. Please make greater effort next time. I'm with those who said that Grisham really did not know how to end this one. The end, while listening to it on audio CD, was very abrupt.Not my favourite by a longshot."
2,Nice ambiance but substandard plot,"I liked the ambiance of Bologna, and the descriptions of the city. However the plot is substandard and the ending not so good, it seemed like Grisham didn't know how to end this one."
2,Boring,"This is the first Grisham book that I've read. I know I'm a little late, but I only picked up this book because I was reading it aloud for someone who was interested in it. It was dragging and if it were my choice, I would've put it down after the first couple of pages. I was relieved when I was done, so that I wouldn't have to pick it up again. I've been to Italy and have studied the language, so I did enjoy the many references and dialogue. Other than that, I really could care less about a powerful political negotiator and a governmental scam. If you are looking for something that's easy to read and isn't that exciting, maybe this book is for you."
2,"Don't bother, not anywhere as good as other Grisham books","This was a very frustrating book to read. It started out as a potentially good ""action"" book, but the action never really started. Then it became an Italian travelogue, with a hint of romance, but the romance never really started either. Then when you thought that maybe the action would finally show up, the story ended with nothing really happening. I actually looked at the authors notes at the end of the book to see if there was more to come.Dont't waste your time reading this book."
2,"Meh. Formulaic, obviously hoping to sell movie rights","Not the John Grisham I used to like. This was formulaic, and it seemed as if the author were writing with an eye toward having this made into a movie thriller. Except...um...it wasn't thrilling. I just couldn't care all that much what happened to Backman. Very little character development in ANY character.It'll kill time on the beach or while traveling, but it'll be pretty easy to put down when it's time to go to bed at night."
3,Not one of his best,"I'm at a point now where I am starting to believe that John Grisham's time in the spotlight is coming to an end. This latest novel is one to join the ranks of his other mediocre and disappointing works. The story begins interestingly enough, but fails to continue in that vein. The main character has no real depth and his love interest, the typical aloof love interest of most John Grishman novels, seems to have entered the picture solely to make sure that there IS a love interest. The main character's time in Italy is only sporadically interesting. I certianly could have done without the long dialogues about learning Italian and about what the man in the restaurant is wearing. To be blunt, there was entirely too much filler."
3,"Surprise, Surprise","I just finished Grisham's latest. He did surprise me with his ending but overall the story was pretty far fetched. Oh well, I did line his pockets a little because I purchased the book, but the story was not as outstanding as some of his others.I wonder, sometimes, if an author, after a spate of early success and record earnings, becomes an automaton turning out book after book because that is the way they are now programmed, regardless of the quality of the story. Grisham definitely has a talent for storytelling. He just needs to focus on it again. I sometimes think that Tom Clancy suffers from the same malady."
2,A snail-paced chase,"Not an entirely bad read, it just wasn't very exciting for me. I think the book is interesting during the first few chapters; however, the story is more and more and more of the same. This story could have been wrapped up in 5 chapters; however, by dragging it though 36 slow-boil chapters, the only thing hunted and assassinated is suspense."
2,Yawn,"I expected more from Grisham, but really this book isn't all that good. Nice character development, but no action, no drama. Third act wraps up with little suspense. Pass on this one..."
2,Slow Moving and uneventful,"About 70% of the book is about JB's Italian language lessons - rather boring. Then, the last 7 chapters (out of 36 chs) get interesting, but not that interesting.This was another of John Grisham boring line of books. Except for King of Torts, Grisham hasn't written a good book in a while"
2,too much Italy...what about the rest?,"Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?And talking about the end...could it be more simple?Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else."
2,So close....,"Good start, but bad finish. I liked the way infused Italian culture into the setting, but not enough suspense! Bad finish...unless he is taking lessons from Daniel Silva and coming back to write a sequel, this book needs work! His editor must have been out to lunch on the end of this one! Such a shame...because the plot was so good."
2,"Not as bad as ""Skipping Christmas""","John Grisham seems to be writing now because his agent or someone else ask him to write. His heart and consequently, his soul, is not in it. Grisham is not a spy novelist, so he is obviously out of his element here. The novel is slow; a lot of the characters seem contrived. Teddy Maynard, the CIA director, looks like ""Dr. Stranglove."" Most of the book is a travelogue. The ending is rushed and forced. And the idea of him heading off in the sunset to meet his ""soul mate,"" for want of a better term, is too much. Please, John, get better or find another line of work."
3,Reads like a travel guide to Italy,"I listened to the unabridged audio version of The Broker. And while I enjoyed I found it to be an average read. I knew from Grisham's past works that his despicable protagonist would reform and overcome his problems. And the Broker was no exception. What bothered me most was that very little actually happened. Joel goes to cafes. He hangs out with his tutors. He learns Italian. He eats food I cannot even name. He falls in love with a woman, and avoids bad guys.This was a good book, but its hardly a four star effort. It might be nice if it were labeled a 'cozy' mystery. More time was spent touring italy and drinking cappucino than pursuing justice or fighting bad guys. Average. But not Great. Three Stars."
4,"Interesting read, fast paced and enjoyable!","I'd have to say this is another home run for Grisham. I just love his writing style. With this book, as with many others- you just love to hate the main character (and vice versa) in this case, Joel Backman. I was really hooked into this one, Grisham did an excellent job painting scenery and emotion in this book. I found myself looking over my shoulder and feeling like I was being followed after I read this. Excellent!"
4,John Grisham has gone Cloak & Dagger in The Broker !,"Seasoned readers of John Grisham's novels would expectanother saga of court room battles where plaintiff'sattorney played Tug-Of-War with the accuse'scounsel.This is not the case in The Broker.It has been a long time since The Partner that Grishamhas set his story outside Clanton & away from theMississippi area.Infact,the author has written in anew and refreshing way that might lead readers tothink they are reading a tourist guide book of Bolognainstead.In addition, the author has gone high tech in this onewhere the characters in this story used Secure Emailfor communication.Fans of John Grisham must read this veryinteresting,romantic & alluring tale of the rise &fall of a once mighty power broker."
3,My first.,"This is the first Grisham novel I have read and I have to admit I went into it with great expectations. I found it hard to get into but forced myself on hoping that it would get better.... and it did... the last quarter or so was fast paced and exciting, maybe even 5 star material...or it seemed that way compared to the beginning of the book. Definitely not the greatest book I have ever read but I'm not ready to write the author off completely yet..."
4,The Broker,The Broker is a fascinating book about a man on the run from someone but he doesn't know who. Joel Blackman Used to be a Washington power Broker and a hot shot lawyer with his own firm. This all changed when he given a computer program that let him control a satellite system that no one was supposed to have. He was arrested and put in a federal Prison. Six years later he was pardoned by the President. The CIA wants to see who will come after him and try to kill him. Now he needs to find a way to run away and were to go. This book is modern fiction. I would suggest it if you like action and mystery at the same time. The author John Grisham has written many other books like The Runaway Jury. This book is great and I would suggest that you read it.
4,Very Interesting,"Different from many of Grisham's novels, not so lawyerly - I loved it. I would recommend it in a minute - a page turner!"
1,Buy if you want to Learn Italian & All About Italian Dining,"I am a fan of Grisham and when I read what the book was about I thought it sounded interesting enough to purchase in hardback version. If you are interested in learning the language of Italian or the history of Italy, this is the book for you. Phrases and words are translated throughout the book making me think he was already loking ahead towards a movie and did all the translating for them. Seriously I would highly suggest you skip this book or goto a library and check it out. Do not waste your hard earned money."
4,Good Classic Grisham,"I needed a paperback for airplane reading for business travel. I had not read Grisham for a few years. Once he started off with ""A Painted House"" I stopped reading him. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Maybe not of the highest literary standards or framework but then again Grisham really never was, right? Nice story, great locations, and the thrill of the run. I think he could have wrapped up the story a little better but I would love a sequel for good 'ol Joel Backman-The Broker."
4,Beautiful scene stealing locations blends well,"I loved this book. I am a Grisham fan but not certainly a literary expert.I loved the characters, the plots, the irony of a lot of them, and wanted to ask for more than the 3 stars it has been averaging.This is a 5 star book.Some one John's books have been life changers in their own ways.The Broker re-affirem true love and romance and was a wonder travel log of Italy just after I left on a too brief visit.It is not anything like standard Grisham but that makes me love it all the more. Please read the book. You will never be sorry.It is one I will read again"
1,Simply Dreadful,"Mr. Grisham has reached the point in his career where he seems completely happy to churn out drivel to meet his contracts with his publishers. I've read every book by him and this is by far the worst. Horrible pacing, an imminently un-interesting protagonist and the ending is the worst I've ever read."
2,Paid Vacation,"I appauld the writer for arriving at that sweet spot in life where he can go on a working vacation to Italy for however long he chooses to write another book. Grisham is a great writer, but this is not a great book by any stretch. It's not even a good book even though Grisham's talent at wordcraft and sentence structure is ever apparent. The story was dull, the outcome insipid and tired. I listened to the audio version and the speaker is truly outstanding in bringing this tired book to life. Save your money or you will be as exhausted as the protaganist as you struggle to jusify your purchase. Not Grisham's best - almost his worst."
2,"sorry mr. grisham, but this story was really lame","I felt cheated and ultimately disappointed after reading this book and having spent about 3 hours on it in total. Thank goodness it was a library rental and I had not invested any of my own funds for it. The beginning started out quite suspenseful and had my interest piqued, but the middle section about Bologna (bologne is more like it, if you ask me) dragged on and on with all that useless crap about learning Italian, Mr. Grisham even had the nerve to include all that Italian in there. Backman was not a sympathetic character at all (greedy scum) and I kept hoping that he will get killed so that the story would finally end. And after all, what are the chances that a lawyer will have the skills and smarts necesssary to escape from a hoarde of professional killers hired to do their job? Lame and a sorry waste of my time."
1,What a lot of rubbish,"Is this book a thriller or is it a language and travel primer? Grisham has padded his book with a lot of unnecessary material about learning the Italian language and Italian cities - al of it irrelevant to the story. I know that most Americans do not travel but this is ridiculous - he treats his readers as morons.There are a lot of errors too. e.g. Prosecco is not the Italian champagne, it's a sparkling wine used as an aperitivo. Their 'champagne' is made by Ferrari.Grisham should stick to what he knows - the law."
3,"A Travel Guide for Bologna, Italy","The 1st 2 chapters are great, the last 2 chapters are great. But the middle 30 are a monotonous tour of Italy. Cut this book in half & you would have a fantastic short story. Joel Backman's intriguing character keeps you turning the pages of an otherwise boring novel."
2,Yet still One More Disappointment,"Idea for plot - 8. Execution - 3. Grisham's journey down the slippery slope continues. This is definitely not The Firm, or even Runaway Jury. More like The Last Juror and Testament. So, reader beware. What's with all the Italian language stuff ?Note to myself: Give it up and move on. John ain't there no more."
1,Very boring,"I was very disappointed by this book - it starts up fairly interesting when the situation of Backman's pardon is nicely painted for the reader, but it is all downhill from there. There is so much description of the Italian sights, the Italian way of life, the Italian meals etc. etc. that I got the impression of reading a travel-diary. Was Grisham vacationing in Italy and made a book out of it?At times there is an attempt to bring in some excitement, for example when the different [...]-teams are being brought into the game, but that never really amounts to anything.The ending is left somewhat open and is rather weak.All in all a big disappointment."
1,400 pages of useless words,"I never previously read a book (certainly not from John Grisham), which was so an utterly waste of time.Throughout the book, I was anticipating that the actual page turning suspense would start any minute. However, after about 300 pages I realized it was going to end as it started : with nothing.If you intend to buy it, don't. If you already bought it, burn it."
1,A Thriller ??? - NOT THRILLED AT ALL,"This is the most boring book I have read in a very long time. I read the entire novel waiting for something exciting to happen and it never did. Nothing happens in this book ever, not even at the end. I think Grisham had better take some lessons on intrigue writing from Robert Ludlum or go back to what he does best. The editors also should read a novel before they publish it and not assume it will be great just because of the author. Don't waste you time or money."
2,Grisham just gave up writing at the end,"I used to buy Grisham's books sight unseen. After this one, I question whether I will buy another one. The book was ok until the end. It was like he had to make the book so many pages and then just quit. It was totally unbelievable that all these bad guys just couldn't knock him off at the end for no good reason. In reality he would have been dead in five minutes. Please. More books like The Painted House."
2,"Okay, Hate Me","Reading this book was torture for me because I found it so, well, boring. Don't get me wrong - I like Grisham, have ever since his very first, which I think is his very best. Also enjoyed most of the others, although I'd like to see him get back to the style he used in A Time to Kill or even The Firm or The Pelican Brief. This one is mediocre at best, left me feeling that Grisham was only half-heartedly writing the thing. Maybe now the money is more appealing than the love of writing. Come on, Mr. G., you can do better than this.Will I read his next one? You betcha."
1,Totally Predictable,"I was really disappointed. I paid $16 for the hardcover and I feel cheated. After about 30 pages I could predict exactly how it would end, and I was right! I won't ruin it for you, but there is a common theme that started in ""The Firm"" that continues here."
1,Disappointed Again,I was a big Grisham fan for his first several books. I have been very disappointed in his last few books. The plots are fairly predictable and he tends to rush the plot when he has written so many pages. I feel Grisham's books have lost their passion and freshness. I plan to look elsewhere for my suspense novels.
1,Not much here...,"I bought this book because the story takes place primarily in Italy which I thought would be interesting and maybe educational. However, the plot was poorly developed and the story did not have an ending. A weak ""love story"" was also thrown in for good measure. The use of Italian words and translations was stimulating but otherwise this book was a let down. Lately, it seems like Grisham's publisher has him on a tight deadline for each new book he writes. Quantity over quality. His stories start out with an interesting idea but never really get developed (The Testament would be another example). If you like stimulating and satisfying reading then stay away from Grisham's later books."
4,good read,I enjoyed the characters and suspence of this novel. The cultural trip through Italy was a refreshing change for grisham.
2,More Than Disappointing,"This book had the skeleton of a good plot, but it never developed. Tension fizzled at every opportunity, and the romance element was flat. The best part was that it took place in Italy, my favorite country. Otherwise, choose any of Grisham's other books over this one. Not recommended."
2,surprisingly disappointed,For the first time I found a Grisham's story to de disjointed. I was left with the feeling that the writer was told to cut many pieces out in order to meet demands.
3,Fizzles at the end,"I've thought Grisham was getting really sloppy and lazy recently: and then I picked this up and thought, ""Damn! He's got a new editor!""I really enjoyed this and recommended it to my friends.The ending fizzles a bit, however. Spoiler:What the hell happened to Sammy Tin?"
1,grisham out of gs,"boy o boy has this wonder boy run out of gas. ""the broker"" has a thin plot, nondescript characters and is poorly written to boot. basically i think it was written to justify a summer in italy for the irs. grisham wants to tell us how smart and worldly he is and how he could outsmart the best of the intelligence agencies if he were born again in some foreign city. this is a boring and fairly stupid book and not worth the money or time to read it.dgs"
1,Disappointing. Avoid it.,"This work by Grisham, who has written some excellent popular fiction in the past, especially in the law novel genre, is simply comparatively horrid. The plot is implausible, predictable, and, worst of all, boring. The characters are shallow. The resolution is disappointing and incomplete. The only aspect of the book which is entertaining at all is a meager offering of the sense of style of the residents of Bologna, Italy. To waste any more words on this review is unnecessary. Find something else to read."
2,Abridged CD version -- disappointing,"I received the abridged audio version as a Christmas gift. Maybe I should blame the abridgment, but it was about the least-thrilling thriller I've ever come across. I listened to the entire set of CDs fairly quickly, in several days of my lengthy commute, and kept expecting there to be an increase in tension... especially when ""the chase"" started. Instead, it was a rather placid description in which everything goes along almost uneventfully and without a hitch, with basically no real threat to the protagonist.Not a ""bad"" book; just boring.There's also a puzzling ""continuity"" glitch, relating to the substantial amount of money the protagonist has for the initial part of his escape. Maybe the explanation got lost in the abridgment."
2,Left Hanging,"Not a bad read but the ending (so called) leaves the reader suspecting that the author gave up on the book and went out for a cup of coffee, while leaving some beginning writer to complete the book in 25 words or less. What a let down."
2,Boring up until the last 30 pages.,"It's been so long since I've read a good Grisham book, I was hoping this would be a return to the style and pace of his initial blockbusters. Not so. Most of the book has the main character lounging around Bologna with the reader just waiting for something to happen. Finally, the book picks up the pace in the last 30 or so pages. The story also has lots of rather large logical flaws, but it's main fault is simply that it's boring."
2,Fun to read by ultimately unsatisfying,"I loved how much Grisham loves Italy. It infused his writing with a passion and grace that made the ""travelogue"" sections great fun to read. But the plot and the characters? Yawn. I completely missed the part where our hero falls in love with the mysterious and sad Francesca. When did that happen exactly? And what of American ex-patriate professor, Luigi and Hermano? We're introduced to them at length and then there is no resolution to their story line. The action? What action? So while I enjoyed turning the pages as I was actually reading this book, now that I'm done I feel as though I wasted my time."
3,Not his Best,"Grisham was never an espionage specialist as he proves in this novel. He should have stuck to writng his law novels. The Broker has a crackling dialogue and it moves fast, but the espionage details are sadly insipid. The setting research is good, but it also sounds like an Italian language tutor. I wouldn't recommend this novel, unless you read a novel purely for its pace."
2,Someone Should Have Brokered a Better Book,"Where were Grisham's editors? Inconsistencies--both in character's actions and in logic--destroy any chance of suspense or the reader feeling any genuine interest in what's happening in this non-starter. Neither suspense, nor mystery, nor thriller, The Broker is simply a dressed up travelogue, sprinkled with superficial language, fashion, and geographic touches. Grisham's prose is flat and workmanlike in this outing, making one yearn for even the least inspired James Lee Burke effort. Give this one a miss."
4,Interesting Reading,"I suspect that Grisham had numerous pleasurable experiences researching this book, which largely takes place in Italy. He writes his story describing many fine Italian restaurants and must have spent many days in the Italian countryside. The story line is interesting, but could have been ""juiced up"" a bit more. With professional killers looking to do ""Marco"" harm, he avoided even a glancing bullet to his body. I appreciated the fact that he developed an interesting work of fiction without using vulgarity. I wasn't real keen on all the Italian sentences he used, but he followed up with the meaning of each sentence. Grisham left the door open for a follow up, should he want to go back to Italy, for a sequal. All in all, The Broker was an easy book to read, and well worth the hours it takes to get through its pages."
1,A Lot of Build Up For an Extremely BORING Ending,"This book was terrible. Entertaining at first, but towards the end you just want whatever is going to happen to happen.Not to ruin the ending for you, but nothing ever happens.It makes me wonder if Grisham actually wrote this book."
1,Zero Stars Would Be Appropriate,"I finally gave up on this book on page 151. If you are into learning how to read restaurant menus in Italian or if you need something to read so you can quickly fall asleep then this is the book for you. Grisham builds absolutely zero empathy for the protagonist and the cast of characters surrounding him are sooooo dull. The amount of print devoted to learning the Italian language is just God-awful incredible. I do not know why or how Grisham could write such drivel, English or Italian. Take the money you would spend on this book and go to Olive Garden for dinner--you will be spending your time and money far more wisely and the menu will be in English."
4,It was ok not his best but a good read.,Im not sure how to rate this book I liked it but it never really went anywhere. The story seemed so promising but turned out to be a bit slow with alot of Italian spread throughout. I was always wondering is this thing about to get good and never did. The scenery makes me want to go to Italy cause its described so beautifully. You never really found out why the hits were called off and we didnt hear anything from Tin Tin? This was by far not my favorite Grisham. I felt as if his last book was better. A decent Grisham book but not his best in my opinion.
3,Average effort by Grisham,The novel story line starts promisingly but the story lose its steam halfway and ends without a thump. I am a bit disappointed with the story line. This novel is certainly not among the best works by Grisham.
4,An international thriller,In the closing hours of a president's term a pardon was granted to a power broker. This leads to an incredible sequence of events in the United States as well as Italy. This book is a great read.
1,A true dissapointment,"The author and the publisher should both hang their heads in shame. The plot is thin, predictable , and tired.The majority of the book is devoted to an unlikable ""hero"" learing basic Italian.I suppose the author had to deliver a book and wrote this over a plate of pasta."
3,Stayed up until 2 AM to finish the book,"I was waiting for the action to start, but it never did. I can say that the book held my interest, but the character were not developed enough. Joe's family was hardly mentioned other than his one son who helped him by sending him a smartphone and some cash. The people who were after him were just an after thought. Mostly just a tour of Bologna Italy and listening to Joe learn the language. What happen to the running broker on the cover??????? I expected more but like I said I actually did stay up until 2 AM to finish the book lucky it was a Saturday."
2,Disappointing,"What starts out as a decent plot quickly turns in to a travel log of Italy. I though the ending might at least save the book --but no, that was disappointing too."
3,Grisham not out of steam yet...,"In John Grisham's latest novel, he uses his magnificent storytelling ability to craft another good book. While not as good as his earlier writings such as 'The Firm', 'The Chamber', 'A Time to Kill', and 'The Partner', it is much better than his previous two legal thrillers, 'The Last Juror' and 'The King of Torts', which felt more like documentaries than novels. If you are a true John Grisham fan, then 'The Broker' will not let you down."
3,Half of the book is good,"The book starts good.Then once Backman is in Italy, the story gets dragged for ever..The last hundred pages became very interesting and made me not put the book down before I complete..."
3,Why do I keep reading Grisham?,"Once again, a good Grisham book falls flat with an ending that just ends with no big climax. Ugh. The scenery in Italy was excellent, even though the plot was difficult to believe. I enjoyed the Italian language lessons and the cafe experiences. But I certainly felt cheated in the end."
2,Yikes!,"I've read all of Grisham's books and enjoyed some more than others. On several occasions while reading the Broker, I stopped to think, sheesh, this book is more about Italy's buildings and restaurants. Not that this is a bad thing, it's just not what I expected.My second complaint is the characterization. Backman is a slimy, greedy lawyer, and while six years in jail apparently reforms him, it doesn't reform him enough where he'll actually apologize to his son. I was hoping right to the end of the book, but sadly, Backman's greatest concern, is to leave the country and look up his Italian woman. Despite having given his son nothing all these years, the son still found it in himself to help him. Not a good thing when you don't like your main character.It seemed to me Grisham decided he wanted to write a book about Italy and the story was secondary in his considerations.I don't care about spending $12 on this book, but I need to go find me a GOOD book to get this one out of my system."
2,Not so great,"I wish I could say that ""The Broker"" is worth reading, but it's really not. The plot is predictable and the pacing poor. As for the setting in Bologna -- one of the main reasons I bought the book -- Grisham really does not do the city justice. Bologna is Italy's great non-tourist city. Amazing food. The arcades. A vibrant university culture. Grisham touches on all of that but doesn't really capture the city.His hero -- Joel/Marco is a schmuck and the ending makes no sense at all."
4,Short on ending,"I've been a fan of John Grisham for years but it seems his last few books have been short on ending. I loved THE LAST JUROR but it tried to combine two different stories in one and I don't think was effective. The ending just sort of dropped away, like a bad Monday Night Movie.Bleachers was good and I enjoyed listening to the tape with Grisham talking.THE BROKER is better but I wish it was a little longer with more of an ending. He tends to ""hurry up"" and finish these days and there seems to be much more going and then tries to wrap it up quickly.THE FIRM and TIME TO KILL were favorites."
1,Not again!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I thought I swore off Grisham after ""The Summons"", but I gave him a couple more chances with his next books, which were better, but not classic--this one was a total yawner-could have taken Italian language lessons in school, and what's with the travelogue???-Get to the nitty-gritty, John-this was a cure for imsomnia"
2,Grisham has seen better days,"The Broker is definitely not his traditional southern lawyer thriller. In fact, most of it takes place in Europe and it reads more like a Tom Clancy spy novel. Grisham leaves a lot of loose ends and there is not much of a late plot twist as is customary of his novels. It was pretty predictable after you got a good grip on the storyline. He also introduces a few characters that seem like they'll play an integral role in the plot, but Grisham makes them disappear as quickly as they appear. You're left wondering why he even wrote them into the story to begin with.I give it a C- overall. I hope Grisham does better next year, although I suspect that his publisher was pressuring him to move away from his traditional work."
1,Disappointing....,"I read this and kept thinking with every page turn that something was about to happen, but you know what? It never does. The book had a lot of potential but wasted it. Grisham spends at least 200 pages describing Italian lessons. Can't he come up with something better than that? With the descriptions of all the countries out to get Joel and the methods they use, I thought someone would try, but no... There is no hidden plot, no someone that you're trying to guess which team they're on, no surprises, not much of anything. A big disappointment."
2,Grisham is a better writer than this,"I'll have to admit that I was disappointed with John Grisham's lastest novel, The Broker. I purchased the book new but wish now I'd waited and picked it up at the library. I was hoping to read something close to the ""The Firm"" or one of his better books. But this one left me sadly disappointed. I think he got a little carried away with speaking Italian to the point that at times I thought it was almost boring. And if there's anything I hate, it's paying for a book that can bore me. Something in me wants to think he had the right idea for a really good plot, but just didn't know how to carry it through to make the story exciting...a real page turner. I'm sure Grisham put lot of effort into this, so I can only wish him better luck next time."
4,"Power, Politics and Grisham","A Washington power broker is incarcerated and his subsequent pardon by a lame duck President is the subject of a new Grisham novel that focuses on ethics and morality in government. The competing interests of the CIA, FBI and White House result in strategies that may be a bit predictable but are, nevertheless, exciting and entertaining. In suspenseful fashion that is a Grisham hallmark, the author leaves us with a compelling question: Who is running our country?"
3,Not one of his better books,"I'm a huge Grisham fan but this one wasn't up to par with his other books. It was just ""okay"". The plot didn't have much substance to it and was lacking suspence. I don't see this one being made into a movie. I still enjoyed Grisham's style of writing which didn't change but there just wasn't much to the story."
1,Grisham is losing his grip,"Another crappy book. First, the King of Torts, and now this...I give up on Grisham."
4,I'm now a Grisham fan...,"My first John Grisham book since A Time to Kill, this read was a blast! With a voice similar to Dan Brown, I found Grisham's story about a Washington deal broker fascinating. Halfway through, I was simply unable to quite turning pages. What a pleasure.The depth of Italian culture in The Broker was worth the price of admission. Like all great stories, the depth of research made all the difference. In my opinion, this book is four stars because of the riveting details of Marco's new and unfamiliar journey. A journey which gripped my intrigue page after page. Job well done, Mr. Grisham - you have a new fan."
1,Wake up American readers,"Get this from the library as I did - if you must - having spent too much money on Grisham's books in the past (they are paperback summer reading fodder only) I resolve never to read another of his worthless stories. How can intelligent people at the New York Times Book Review consider it an ""Editor's Choice""? They obviously did not read it and makes me wonder about the whole system of selecting Editors Choice books. Do not waste your money ....there are so many more worthwhile books to read"
3,A little slow to get moving,This book was a little slow in the beginning but about half way through it started living up to my expectations of John Grisham
4,Italia!,"""The Broker"" was a very entertaining little novel. Joel Backman, once a power broker in Washington DC, was sentenced to federal prison after his dealings compromised national security. After serving just 6 months, he finds himself pardoned and shipped off to a new life in Italy where he must become Marco Lazzeri. However, just as Marco starts to get comfortable in his new home, the CIA leaks his wherabouts to the parties involved in Backman's deal-gone-awry. Who will get to him first? Which party had the most to loose from that deal?Best of all, the reader gets to learn about modern Italian customs through the eyes of our sharp protagonist as he blends into his new environment. When is the best time of day to order a cappuccino in Italy?"
5,Great Novel,"I didn't know what to expect since I was very disappointed and bored with The Brethren. Needless to say, I thought this was a great read. Grisham breaks off from his normal lawyer based novels and takes the reader on an exciting journey."
2,wrong premise,"Normally, I'm a big fan of Grisham, and I must admit that the book is masterfully written. However the various plots just could not exist in the real world. CIA killing an American adviser to the President? NOT going to happen. Additionally, Grisham just doesn't get the conversation inside Washington at the time the book was written. The CIA was fighting for its life against politicization (and failing in several instances). The DIA was constantly entering fabrications into the matrix. The Cheney administration was good at drawing solid lines between imaginary points, using false intelligence vetted by DOD.No, while I normally like Grisham's work, the alleged facts in the book just don't jibe with the real world. I do offer 2 stars to the master storyteller, but he needs to dig a lot deeper to get to reality.Sometimes the truth can be stranger than any fiction."
5,kaboodle,grisham's books are always great. we read all of them. since he was a lawyer and in the mississippi policits he has first hand info. on the stuff he writes.
4,The Broker,"It took me awhile to ""get into"" the idea of the story until the characters were defined by their role. This did not deter me from enjoying the book and I found it to be an ""easy"" read."
2,Where is Grisham headed?,"This is definitely a step backwards for this author. The story is thin and the characters are difficult to embrace, just the opposite of his earlier works which were rich in plot and had characters that compelled you to keep reading. Even with his early departure from ""law"" novels, such as ""A Painted House"", he maintained a certain intensity that made me a huge fan.This latest book leaves me feeling flat.I cannot help but wonder whether he wrote this book prior to his rise to fame and fortune."
1,My respect for John Grisham has just disappeared,"Why did John Grisham think he can write about his holiday in Italy and his Italian lessons and somehow fool us into thinking this is a political thriller? Does he really think we're that stupid?If you want to read monotonous page after page of ""The Italian for car is macchino"" and ""This Italian castle was built in 1428..."" then by all means buy this book. But if you are expecting some thrills and anything more than a basic plot, don't waste your money.I, for one, shall be returning this book to the bookstore. What a waste of time and money. The arrogance of Grisham! No book has ever made me angry like this before. Shameful!"
1,WHAT THE...???,"OK, Grisham... stop it! If I wanted to know how to learn Italian in 13+ mind-numbing chapters, I would not have picked up a Grisham novel. I read your books for suspense, humor, and good story-telling. I want to be entertained, gosh darnit!!!Are you gone for good???"
1,Too bad they don't have a '0 star' rating,"Or even a 'negative star' rating.I've never written a review of a book on Amazon, positive or negative, but after having suffered through 100+ pages of repetetive descriptions of ordering food in restaurants in Italian, I decided I had to.... if only to hopefully save someone else the time spent reading this pile of tripe.There is no intrigue, there is no plot, there is no humor.... I'm still not really sure what the book was really supposed to be about, other than a vehicle to show off Mr Grisham's rudimentary knowledge of Italian.I've also never burned a book before, but it's cold outside and I'm determined to get some benefit from the thing.Where's my matches......"
2,Save Your Time - Buy A Frommer's Guide to Italy....,"The story opens with promise with numerous twists and turns from the White House to lobbyists to big buck lawyers... And then just when I'd settled in for this return to classic Grisham, the book darts aimlessly down some diversionary path for about 30 chapters. Grisham drones endlessly, describing in ornate detail Italian cuisine, architecture, customs and the like.The book could have been condensed into a 5 chapter short story, complete with a pointless, drifting conclusion. Nothing to do with substantial plot development occurs in the middle 80% of the book. Granted I was educated IN DETAIL on Italian vocabulary and pasta, but felt somewhat ripped off.If you're looking for a primer before an Italian vacation this is the book for you. Otherwise, save your time."
3,"Good, not great Grisham....ending is too abrupt","I've read all his books, even the lesser ones have been entertaining, but for the record:1. The ending required some suspense, but instead things are just too easy for the main character.2. A climax you are expecting never happens.3. The chase scenes are walking chases...no running, no cars, no trains, no planes...unless he's NOT being chased.4. You never really are sure whether the protagonist is a good guy or bad guy turned good.5. The book is still very fast, Grisham has a style no one else has where you really do care about the character.6. You wish there were more."
2,Where's the suspense?,"This book lacked any suspense or twists, which I've enjoyed in other John Grisham books. When I finished this book, i just said ""That's it?!?"". Not worth the time to read."
2,Worst Book Yet,"I have read every Grisham book except Bleachers and this was by far his worst. Before this one I felt that The Client was his weakest and even that book kept me riveted to a degree.Nearly all of Grisham's books make the locale a part of the story ,but in this book the locale is too much of the story. I wanted to read a suspense novel, not an Italian 101 language course."
1,Avoid,"This has to be one of the worst books even penned by Grisham. The novel starts out nicely with some suggestions of great possibilities to follow. However, it soon becomes an Italian travelogue and introduction to Italian culture, cuisine and language.Where has the real Grisham gone? The person who ""wrote"" (I use the term loosely) this book could not be the same person who gave us Client or A Time To Kill and other legendary legal crime thrillers.A bust."
4,A Fun Read,"I disagree with those reviews that are calling him a ""has been"". That might be due to his trying to expand his writing direction with books like: A Painted House, Bleachers, and now The Broker. If anything, I felt like it had hints of classic Grishman: suspense, interesting characters, and intrigue. One thing Grisham has always had a knack for, is getting you to feel for shady characters. Joel Backman in The Broker is no different. I found myself pulling for a convicted felon! Do I think this is the best Grishman yet? No. However, I did think it was a fun, escapist read."
1,A big yawn,"In the author's note Grisham admits he knows nothing about satellites or high tech. Now it seems he also lost his storytelling ability.I kept on reading the endless menus of Bologna's restaurants and the Italian-English translations of the flat, boring dialogue hoping the story will somehow develop, but was mightily disappointed. The characters are of the cardboard variety with no substance whatsoever and the storyline barely holding by a thread with nothing really happening till the very end.Is this really the same author who gave us ""The Firm"" and ""The Pelican Brief""? Obviously, Grisham's name sells books and these days he gets contracts to publish just any nonsense he chooses. As readers, we can only vote with our $$$ - don't waste your money or time."
1,Awful cloak and dagger yarn. Don't waste your time.,"Unless you want to learn Italian, don't bother with this book. There are weakly drawn characters everywhere. The star of the book is Bologna, Italy and it's cafes."
4,Fun!,"I haven't read a Grisham book since ""The Brethren""This book was fun! The story is classic Grisham, with all the elements we see in previous books like The Firm, Pelican, etc. Pehaps a bit more sparse in details about the characters, but good stuff.By the time I was finished, as a side benefit, I was ready to take up learning another language.Worth the time."
2,What is this? Grisham has gone mental!,"In the middle of Italian language and tour guide book, short and uninteresting story popped out.So... John Grisham goes on an extended trip to Italy and now he is compelled to write about it in a form of a novel.What's next? John Grisham writing about his trip to toilet in a form of a novel where a hero battles constipation?The days of Rainmaker, Firm and Partner are long gone."
2,Grisham has lost his touch....,"This was not as bad as ""The Juror"" or ""Bleachers"".... but it had sooooo much potential that was wasted. Someone should tell him to stop ""cranking them out like Harliquin Romance novels, and actually put forth a little effort. Really disappointing."
1,Awful,"I can't believe I actually made it through this book. If it weren't for a few long planes trip, I have no doubt I would have stopped reading this book after the first 50 pages. The book is basically a boring, cliched spy novel intertwined with a Italian tourist pamphlet. And after you finish reading the rushed, hackneyed ending, Grisham basically admits he knows nothing about international espionage and explains that you'll just have to live with it. So here's his message: I just wrote 350 pages of shameless, boring crap, but people like you will buy anything with my name on it, so thanks for making me rich."
2,Boring / NOISO!!,"I normally devour Grisham's books, but this one was an effort. I've read and loved all his previous works, but The Broker was a disappointment. As other reviewers have pointed out, it reads more like a travel guide to Italy than a legal thriller. I came to the conclusion that Mr. Grisham wanted to visit Italy, so he wrote this book in order to take a tax deduction on his travel expenses. Apparently he also wanted to learn to speak Italian, judging from his constant use of both Italian and English in the dialogue. For example: ""Good morning ma'am / Buongiorno signora"" or ""Buonasera signore / Good evening sir."" I found it extremely annoying to the point of skipping the longer segments in an effort to minimize the headache I got trying to read it. That and the endless tedious descriptions of scenery, food, wine, restaurants, etc. almost put me to sleep. Overall, not worthy of this author's sterling reputation."
1,Ditto on the UGGHH!!,"I have read all of John Grishams books and The Broker is by far his worst!No story, no plot, no suspense=no reason to read. Has the well gone dry for Mr. Grisham??????"
1,This one did not live up to the Grisham legacy!,"How incredibly disappointing!! The premise of the book really intrigued me, intially. The protaganist was serving a prison term when he unexpectedly receives a full Presidential pardon. Of course, however, the government has a secret agenda. The main character possesses international secrets that dare not be exposed. So the CIA sets him free in Europe and then insidiouly leaks the news of his freedom to world leaders. They then sit and wait to see which country will kill him first! Sounds pretty good, right? Well, he ends up wandering aimlessly around Europe for a good 200-250 pages. Absolutely nothing of interest happens. (He does find himself drinking some of the best European coffee, however.) All of this monotony leads to a completely unbelievable, far-fetched ending. I was hoping for so much more. But the Grisham magic was nonexistent in this story."
1,"Awful - but at least it is slow, too (ha)","Boring. I hate books where the author is trying to share their great love of a place without giving the reader any reason to care. Grisham's foray into Italy, which he clearly loves, is just that. Perhaps he and Thomas Harris both vacationed their on advances for their next novels, which then read more like travelogues than actual stories. I know Thomas Harris slapped ""Hannibal"" together at the last minute, and I am relatively sure that Grisham did the same. Why do we receive a detailed explanation of all the hit teams coming for Backman, especially the Chinese guy, only to ((spoiler)) have them totally ignored later? Arrrggghh."
3,mediocre - but tolerable,"I won't repeat all the other reviews. I am a Grisham fan, and while this book was okay I felt ripped off by the steep price commanded by the hardback.My advice is to skip it if you are not a die hard grisham fan like I am, wait for the paperback and save a few bucks if you are.........."
2,1 1/2 Stars -- Don't Waste Your Time And Money!,"While Grisham's latest wasn't bad enough to give up on, he has hit an all-time low with The Broker. The plot (if you want to call the weak, loosely connected story line a plot) is poorly developed, the characters have no depth to them, and the ending (as well as most of the rest of the book) is boring. Rather than being (supposedly) a suspense thriller, The Broker reads more like an historical travelogue of Bologna, Italy and a Berlitz course on learning Italian, which is fairly interesting and the only reason I am not giving this book a 1-star rating. I've read and enjoyed to varying degrees virtually all of Grisham's books, even those that were heavily panned by many reader reviewers. However, The Broker is an almost complete waste of valuable reading time. It seems clear from the ending of The Broker that Grisham has a sequel in mind. Next time, he won't have me (and my money) to support him. Do yourself a major favor and skip this book."
2,yawn,"Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW... But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of ""The Partner"" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks!"
2,What happened to Grisham's touch?,"The last 2 books I've read (this and The Last Juror) have been unrealisticly slow. This novel starts off with a bang, but then it seems like 300 pages of an Italian history book with a mix of a Romance novel. If you don't care to read hundreds of pages about Bologna, then take a pass on this novel. The ending is interesting, but very sub-par for a great author."
2,Where is the ending...,"I listened to this on an audio book and kept looking for the next CD. I could not believe that it just ended. I was hooked! Everything was going good couldn't wait to see what happened next and I was left hanging. Overall it was a good book until the end, where I felt I had just wasted 5 hours of listening."
5,Enjoyed the story,"The Broker was my first John Grisham novel, and I did enjoy the read. The story is about ""The Broker"", known as Joel Backman, who was a high powered legal consultant/Lawyer. Joel Backman let greed run his life, eventually leading to deaths of business associates and colleagues on a deal that went bad and sent nations into frenzy. Landing The Broker in prison for 6 years, resulting in an early pardon swayed heavily by the CIA's top dog Teddy Maynard's influence upon President Morgan, who just lost a landslide reelection and was on his way out of office.The surprise pardon lands The Broker in Europe, while trying to take on a new identity and continuously look over his shoulder. When you read the book you'll learn a little bit of the Italian language, and you'll be captivated by each chapter. What The Broker is destined for, I won't spoil it for anyone, you'll have to read the book and learn for yourself. Overall, I enjoyed the story, and will read other Grisham Novels."
4,Typical(y) John Grisham,"I recently completed Broker, An excellent storyline with a visit to Italy. The book initially caught my attention and I couldnt put it down, but it stretched too much. I think Grisham tried to put too many things. The book is very interesting but the end was very typical. I expected the ending to be much more thrilling. Overall a good book."
4,A Good Fast Read,"Another exciting fast read from Mr. Grisham. The repeated emphasis on Italian food and the Italian language caught my interest more than the whole shenanigan of cool technology, US/international laws, politics, and government routines. Everything is explained quite nicely therefore one could just comfortably sit back and enjoy a tale of creativity and bravery. The ending is also straight forward. No surprises lurking in the corner. I kept expecting a jolting distress but none surfaced. The quick wrap-up of national and international security matters still baffles me. So I just keep reminding myself that is why the book is found in the fiction section."
1,clunker,Having read all of Grisham's works this book just goes no whereexcept up and down the streets of Italy.
1,Wait for the paperback in the library,This book did nothing for me. The travels through Italy was the only part I kind of enjoyed. I never been there so those passages allowed my imagination to picture Joel's travels. That's about it.
5,Definitely my favorite since The Partner!,John is defintely back and I'm so pleased! For a while there it seemed like he lost interest or was distracted and the story lines seemed to wander and never reach the peak of the earlier books. But The Broker has restored my faith. Let's hope for another run by the master.
3,Excellent,"Mr. Grisham has written a good weekend book about a man who is given an unexpected presidential pardon, is taken to Italy to hide, and must figure out why this is happening to him. I never much care, on a personal level, for his characters. They are always morally compromised, it seems to me. But I do like how he writes about them. I thought the chase was excellently drawn. The only quibble? I thought the character, Rudolph, was going to have a bigger role. I was sorry that wasn't true. I recommend this book to anyone who needs an absorbing quick read to kill a few hours."
5,Grisham's BACK!,"I've loved all of the early Grisham novels and The Broker didn't disappoint! For at least 3 or 4 hours I was transported to Bologna, Italy, travelling incognito with Marco. This book will not win major literature awards but it does satisfy the need for an engrossing, fast-paced, not to mention stylish read. I certainly hope that we get to see more Grisham books like this one."
1,GRISHAM'S WORST,"I wish I had never spent the money for this book. After taking me through so many dull ""adventures"" - the ending smelled bad. Be smart and save your money."
3,Strong premise...but...,"As per the norm, I pick up Grisham's novels and knock them out in a couple days. I enjoyed the plot. I like the twists & turns. I thought that he took an usual turn into the world of espionage, but it read fairly well. My only complaint was the ending. Many loose ends...stories not completed...questions unanswered etc. Almost like he was setting the stage for a return of this character in a later offering. If this is the last we see of Mr. Backman I would have liked a bit more closure."
4,Molto Buona!,"This is the third Grisham I have read and to be honest I thouroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.The main plot was held back just long enough to ensure interest in getting past the character introduction. Basing the story in Italy enabled Grisham to slow the pace of the story allowed a rapport to be built with the main character.The pace suddenly picks up in the last 100 pages and turns the book into a real page turner as I waited to find out the fate of 'The Broker'.Although the conclusion seemed to be unfulfilling, the final 10 pages provided the opportunity to wipe the slate clean and see the Broker put on one last show.Despite the book not having the twists and turn I expected, it was an interesting read and Grisham yet again enabled me to bond with the character, and still finish the book with a smile on my face."
5,great story,i loved this booklots of mystery and action grisham has finally written a good book again.i amvery pleased that he has
3,Easy and fun read with one problem...,"I enjoyed reading this story and especially the descriptions of Italy and Italian people, food, clothes, etc. The characters are likable (unlike the King of Torts' main character who I could never force myself to like) and the story is compelling enough to make this a page turner.My only negative comment centers around the fact that Grisham still really seems to struggle on wrapping up the story. It's another abrupt ending that left me wanting more closure. I'm amazed that he can be so talented and popular but still struggle in this area. In the final analysis, however, I think it's still worth the read."
3,A simple read..but could have been better,"This is a beach book or ""On the Plane"" book. Nothing more. The plot is interesting and engaging, but somewhere in the middle of the book, I think the author got bored with his own plot and seeked to end it quickly as he ran out of ideas.The book ended rather anti-climatic and felt rushed. I would recommend only for light, non-intelligent, easy reading."
1,There's nothing like a great novel...,"And this is NOTHING like a great novel. In fact, it is the unhappy marriage of a bad travelogue, poor Italian lesson, cut-out characters, predictable circumstances and a fizzled-out ending (on a par with ""and then I woke up""). Waste of money, and not worth the time to find out how dreadful it was. Not well written. Not interesting. Not exciting. Not anything."
1,Did he write it himself?,"I was really dissapointed by this book! Ususally I can put down Grisham books. But this time, I wasn't even sure it was written by the same author I have liked so much.Very simple plot, no suspense at all, really predictable, 200 pages for the protagonist to get into character and then 20 pages to get everything solved. Really boring!"
2,Getting Worse With Each Book,"I really think that it's time for Mr. Grisham to take a break. His recent books have been utterly boring and repetitive. I used to have a hard time putting his books down because I was hooked. Now I have a hard time picking them up and The Broker was no different. The idea was great but it just dragged on and on. Half of the book was dedicated to Italy. Move on already..""The Broker"" takes up a new life in a small Italian town as Marco Lazerri. A good deal of the middle of the book is taken up with intenisve Italian lessons. Yes, Italian lessons, and not a little sightseeing. Anyhow, the day arrives when the CIA leaks Backman's location to the major satellite players. Now, the CIA can sit back and see which player arrives to remove Backman permanently. That will tidy up their file on the satellite mess.I recommend skipping this one."
2,Tom Clancy Lite,"This had all the makings of a great spy story. And failed to deliver. It reads like a novella that was stretched out to novel length to sell. The ""hero"" Joel Backman spends half the story studying a new language. It reads more like a tour guide of Europe.The story is very implausible (but I won't spoil it.)Read the story if you are bored but otherwise don't waste your time. This is the first Grisham book I've read. I will never waste my time with another."
1,200 Pages of Total Immersion Italian,"The is by far the weakest Grisham novel I've ever read. The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages, learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe. When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense, it's all for naught, as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending.As for Joel Backman, I can't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory. A disgraced lawyer, lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power, all the while causing numerous deaths, and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about? Does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion? You read the book and decide..."
5,One of the better ones!,"I've read all of Grisham's novels. Some are ""great"", some are ""good"" and some are ""just okay."" This is one of the ""great"" ones. I couldn't put it down. I'm not going to talk about the story, just suffice it to say that it's splendidly written and it's a page-turner. Oh, and I didn't mind the Italian travelogue aspects at all. Added to the book's charm, I guess."
2,Goes from slow to slower,"Dull. the mid-100, or so, pages of the book are involved with the protagonist learning Italian. I learned several new words. The one Italian word I wish I'd learned was ""Boring"". The book is a journy from nowhere to nowhere, via the scenic route. The character of the protagonist changes completely, without an acceptable reason. The story moves with the speed of a legal brief in a patent infringement action. Yep, you're right. I really thought it was a waste of my time and money."
2,"Not bad for a rough draft, but where's the ending?","My biggest complaint about this book is that at least five more chapters are needed to complete the book, at a very minimum. The ending is simply missing. Major characters were introduced and then their story lines were abandoned, leaving too much unresolved. It really reads more like a rough draft then a completed work. Really a shoddy effort. Give this one a pass."
2,John Grisham on vacation,"John Grisham is in low-energy mode these days and while this newest poses as a thriller, it's more a what-I-did-on-my-summer-vacation essay. Grisham supplies lots of spy hardware and mean-as-snakes international assassins, but it's all told on automatic pilot. We've been there with him before (and in better books), so this is something of a post card from Italy rather than a full-blown, explosive Grisham knock-out. I must admit this: I want to visit Bologna more than anything."
1,Thank you,"Mr Grisham for an advertising travel guide about the secret corners, exotic avenues and dishes of Italy. I really appreciate your enthusiasism. I have plans now to visit that country...But please next time do a little favour to us, your humble readers, and do not forget to add a story along the process. The Summons and King of Torts were half-lacking it but at least there was something that resembled a story among the entire jumble. But this atrocity takes the cake...One of the worst books released in 2005 and that says many things, given the fact that it was published very earlier this year, in January actually."
1,I really tried to like this book,"OK..... I give up. I have read every Grisham book and maybe its me but his books are just not that good anymore.This last one ""The Broker"" was so bad (and I'm not that fuzzy)was beyond believe. It started out bad and I just kept hoping that it would get better so I stuck with it. When I finally got to the end I became fully convinced that this may be my last Grisham book to read. I just can't keep punishing myself thinking that Grisham's writings will improve.(Sorry John.....)"
1,Too many mistakes in Italian!!,"The history is very, very slow in developing and basically the whole book is noneventful.JB is sent to Bologna and the he came back. Period. Some people apparently wanted him dead! At least that's what Grisham tell us from the start, but then simply nothing happen.But the most annoying thing - being myself italian - is to read so many mistakes in the parts of book written in Italian!! You fun readding this review? Notto really, I thinko but maybe picture the now you have how of italians parts off Brokker like sound."
2,Disappointing...,"Although this book has made me want to go to Italy in the worst way--where else can you linger all day with an espresso, watch people & experience thousands of years old history?, I would highly recommend something else to read on the plane ride over there.In fact I found myself at times saying, ""When is this book going to end, and by the way, who are half these people that are chasing Marco?""There are way too many sub-characters, and not enough intrigue. If you want a really good Grisham, pick up The Street Lawyer."
4,Grisham is back,"Even though I am only 22, I still remember when Grisham's classic, the Firm came out. I have always been an avid reader, and remember reading that book shortly after it came out. I became a fan of Grisham's book after I read that book.Recently, I have begun to think that he lost his ""magic touch"" as I have been disappointed with his last few books. However, the Broker is quite a refreshing change from his last few books. The character, plot, and pacing were all up to par. An added bonus for me was the Italian incorporated into the novel, as I am currently taking Italian 2 this semester in college. I have travelled to Italy in the past, and loved having Italy as the backdrop for this novel.Overall, I think this was a welcome departure from his last few novels and I definitely encourage others to read it!"
2,The Broker,"I am a Grisham fan however this one I am offended by. If Mr. Grisham wants to take a vacation he should take it on his own dime. And to Mr. Grisham I say, remember the fiction writer's cardinal rule, if it doesn't move the story forward LEAVE IT OUT. In my opinion, most of this should have been left on the editing floor.J.C. Anderson"
3,Not his best,"Grisham usually writes from his personal history. This time, he branched out into areas where he has no direct knowledge. It shows. While it is a decent read, it doesn't have the passion of his previous books about the legal field or about the deep south."
2,Not Impressed,"The Broker is comparable to The Pelican Brief in its plot- one individual being chased by the CIA, FBI, and professional assassians from different terror organizations, but the similarities end there: Whereas The Pelican Brief is intriguing and suspenseful, The Broker is dull and boring. At times it felt like I was reading an Italian travel book. Do not waste your time/money on Grisham's latest ""bestseller!"""
1,"Finally, you don't need to go to a car yard to get a lemon","John Grisham is one of the best authors I have ever read. Now he's well and truly lost it. Every book since The Brethren has been nothing more than a sequence of unplotted events (this one being the worst of all, followed closely by the last juror). I know he's not renowned for his endings, but I don't even remember the ending to this (and I only finished it a fortnight ago!). It starts off really well- the first chapter or so is extremely good, very Grisham, then you're dropped in a hole. In a word: plotless"
1,Weak Italian Travel Guide,Not as bad as A Painted House but pretty close. The only thrilling part of the book was I was thrilled to be finished with it. Don't waste your money. Last Grisham for me...he lost it along time ago.
1,A HUGE Disappointment,"I have never expected Grisham to be some incredible literary giant-just to give us exciting, suspenseful, entertaining reads. He fails miserably with THE BROKER. I found myself at times actually skimming pages, during the overboard Italian lessons and travelogue. I have felt for quite sometime that a Grisham read has become more and more like reading a screenplay, and this one is no exception.It feels like he got stuck in the Bologna details for so long that suddenly he had a publication deadline looming (since we MUST put out one a year-keep the cash machine churning), so let's just put a nice little bow on things and go home! No development of any subplots, strange emphasis on characters who come out of nowhere (the lady on the train), and too many loose ends-ok, the Israelis are gone, what about the RC goon, and the Saudis? Just left hanging...Beginning to get leery of spending my money on his work. Oh the salad days of A Time to Kill, The Firm, and Pelican Brief!"
5,Wow!,This book is really different from John Grishams normaly of themes but it is so great. For most of the book thee is bairly any suspense or thriller action but you really get to know the characters. I could not put this book down. I just loved it and it had the best of everything and in the end it works out better than you think. You'll love it!
1,"Boring, Don't Waste Your Time.","When I heard the Broker's plot about a hacker who hacks into a spy satellite, I expected to read about something high-tech. Well the Broker is anything but. The only high-tech stuff that I came across was the smartphone that Joe Backman used. Anything else is loosely organized from the beginning to the end: how the Russian, the Chinese and the Saudis got involve in the Broker's business, why they wanted to take part in the first place, what really happened afterwards, and the way the story ended as if nothing happened.Reading the Broker was more like reading a Bologna guide book. The flow is not focused around the main theme of spy satellite. Mr. Grisham does not seem to know how to relate the theme to the development of the story. He has to learn from Dan Brown in this aspect."
2,Unsatisfying,"As a cloak and dagger novel, very unsatisfying - a nice build-up that just fizzles at the end. The novel feels unfinished."
2,Must read but not a good one,"If you are a Grisham fan, you have to read this book. He has written some great novels in the past and that forces you to want to read The Broker. Problem is, its not very good.In a 350 page book, Grisham spent nearly 200 pages developing the character. There was a weak storyline built in to those pages but it wasn't until the last 100 pages that he half drew you into the story. At that point it picked up a little in pace. The end of the book was OK but far from spectacular.Since I have read every other Grisham book, I had to read this one and I'm sure I will read the next. As for the review, if you are a new Grisham reader, don't start with The Broker."
1,A Disappointed Grisham Fan,"This book was a huge disappointment. It seems that Grisham was bit by the same bug as Pat Conroy in Beach Music. That is, a wildly succesful author spends time in Italy and then feels compelled to build a novel around a travelog. Although the Broker wet my appetite for a trip to Italy, the book was flat-out bad. We are supposed to believe that a low-life white collar criminal finds redemption by spending two months in Italy? Then, as the book builds towards a climax, it simply stops. Although there are some good ""action scenes,"" I was left wondering about the outcome and effect of the protagonist's last actions. Grisham would have never obtained the popularity that he enjoys today had this novel been among Grisham's first."
2,"Wow, I was actually bored","I had never read (or in this case, heard) any of Grisham's works before. I hope ""The Firm"" is better since I have that paperback and have yet to read it.I don't know what it was but I just couldn't get into it. It got kind of interesting towards the end (about 1/2 way through the 4th disc of the abridged version) but that wasn't enough.And the narrator ... I really LIKE Dennis Boutsikaris but my GOD! Even the people in my ride-share noted that his Italian accent was awful.Sorry, John. Sorry, Dennis. Sorry, Random House Audio. This was a dud."
3,Quick start- slow finish,"Overall good read- great explosive start that made me read the first 120 pages in a single reading (normally I'm a very slow reader). Enjoyed getting to know the characters, enjoyed the various plots developing and the continued change of pace, scenery, etc., but slightly disappointed at the cut-off ending- made me wonder about the fate of a couple of the other characters, so unless they're in one of Grisham's other novels- we'll never know what happened to them."
3,Not his best,"Didn't draw me in like Grisham's novels normally do. I thought it was well written, I just didn't get attached to the characters and the plot didn't excite me."
2,Disappointment,Most of John's books are good. I loved the Firm. This one was a huge disappointment. Slow moving. I read the whole book waiting for something exciting to happen and it never did. Totally anti climatic.Only good part was the experience of seeing the character adapt to Italian life.
3,Could Have Been a Great Book,"This novel had the potential of being one of Grisham's best. The part that took away from the novel was a long and boring tour of Italy's cathedrals. But, if you don't mind taking up a lot of reading time on the tour, I thought the story was excellent. You can skip over the cathedral parts. That is what did after a while."
2,Fun for lovers of Bologna,"I was pretty disappointed with all the fictional elements of this book. There was an unbelievable plot, terrible dialogue, and characters that never develop or interest the reader. It would have been less stars but I lived in Bologna for a year and I have weakness for anything of the kind."
3,Fine as far as it goes,"I'm not an avid reader of Grisham's - I might have read a couple of his early books in high school - so I can't really measure this against previous work. As a suspense/thriller type book, it's fine as far as it goes. The plot isn't terribly complicated and it is difficult to get very involved...at the end of the book, I was left with a feeling of, well, not much. Still, it is a fun read and has inspired me to visit Bologna!"
4,low-key suspense,"Joel Backman is ""the Broker""--a Washington power broker-lobbyist. Then his empire collapses when a deal collapses involving a hacked spy satellite that nobody acknowledges, and Backman ends up in jail, broke.Six years later, he's pardoned by a lame duck President, and whisked away to Italy by the CIA. Everyone's after him, including the CIA, though they're more interesting in finding out who kills him than in either killing him themselves or keeping him safe.So Backman is completely out of his element, under constant surveillance, and kept deliberately short of money and paperwork so he can't run far, even if he tries. But he didn't get to be ""the Broker"" by being stupid, either.This was a fairly low-key suspense book, but I enjoyed the transformation from wealthy cold-hearted power broker to someone who's dependent on others for everything, and who's learning to reevaluate his priorities. It was also quite lovely to revisit Italy."
3,Great poolside read,"This page turner mystery kept my interest, but was much slower than a typical John Grisham book. The focus on one main character and one primary location was different from the usual fast pace of names and locations in other Grisham mysteries. Still, it was full of intrigue and was not overly predictable. The main character was very likeable under pressure and the scenary was fantastic."
2,Not the best,"The trouble with the newest Grisham book is that it's boring until near the end when I couldn't put it down. Which was only for one chapter and even then it was like, ""He should have been killed by the spies five minutes ago""............I love most of his books but this was a waste of money and time although I did learn that Italians don't drink cappaccinos after a certain hour and I can order an espresso in a cafe!Wow."
2,WHY DID I FINISH THIS BOOK???,"This is another below-average plodder from Grisham. Suggested tags: thriller (don't be absurd!); Italy (it's a travelogue of Italy, esp. Bologna); CIA (on a rudimentary and laughably superficial level). Sadly, the incredible promise Grisham showed in his early career with those awesome first two books (A TIME TO KILL and THE FIRM) seems to have been slowly drained in subsequent books which were great, to decent, to passable, to misguided, to downright thoroughly disappointing. In short, I don't know why I finished this book; it was grindingly tedious until the last fifty pages -- when it picked up considerably. But then, I should have abandoned it for something better (Dick Francis, James Lee Burke, John Sandford, Robert Parker, Robert Crais) loooong before I discovered that."
2,Take a Break,This book was incredibly boring. Mr. Grisham needs to take a break before he writes his next book.
5,Another Grisham great!!,"Grisham's books are generally the only ones I run out to get the day of their release and this one was no exception. In addition, I read it in 4 days -which is quick for me - setting all others aside. I enjoyed this book as it gets more into government spy, CIA and FBI ""stuff"" - which is always intriguing to me. It layed a bit lower on the law aspect, although the lead character is/was a lawyer. I definitely recommend this book! A great read!"
2,Terribly Boring,"I have read all of Grisham's novels and this by far was the worst. For a 300 page novel, the plot was terribly under developed. The ending was rudimentary and very anti-climatic."
3,Recovery rock?,"When I hear the words ""faith"", ""pray"", and ""God"" in a song, I notice them - strange that other reviewers haven't mentioned J's increasingly religious lyrics. He sounds very much like someone in a Twelve Step program.As usual, the solos are excellent. They're easily the most interesting thing about this batch of songs. J seems to need the tension of a real band to produce his best music. The recent Dino Jr reunion disc (""Beyond"") played J's faith against Lou's skepticism. It was a strong, diverse album. This one feels samey and underdeveloped.But those solos..."
5,Holy and Acceptable,"It is ashamed that this album was overlooked. I bought from BMG's Sound and Spirit site and even though they deal exclusively with gospel music, this little gem is simply as good if not better than a lot of the dance/chill music that I love! Every track is awesome and I think it is my solemn duty to spread the word on this CD. I can only say it is excellent music by lesser known obscure artists and a great testament that worshipping God need not be boring...because this stuff rocks!"
2,"Great photos, smaller than expected","The photos in this book are very good, but be aware that the overall dimensions of the book are only about 5"" x 7"". This is not what I was expecting."
5,Wood boat fans,This is a beautiful small book reference for identifying and enjoying classic sailboats. The photos are beautiful. I use it to help create accurate rigging for the restoration of small vintage pond boats and models.
1,Poor CD Quality,"When I finally received my CD, I couldn't wait to download it to my iPod. Much to my surprize, the CD had alot of static and half of the songs skipped. Since it was an opened CD, I was unable to return the product (per return policy) and lost out on $20 plus shipping costs."
4,Karaoke Review,"I found that this is a great game. Not only is it fun to play alone, but it's great for parties. You can change the levels, from easier to harder, depending on how you sing. It shows how off your pitch is, which is a great feature! I think that this is great for people who love to sing, even if you're not good at singing!"
5,Awesome!!! Can't Wait for the next one!!,"This is an awesome game!!! I love that you have to actually have some talent in order to play. I love how the microphone can pick up what note you are singing. (Isn't technology crazy?!?!) This game is fun for the person/people playing and for anybody who might be just watching. The characters get pretty animated and they glow when you sing really well. (It's pretty challenging to try to get your character to glow during the entire song! But trust me, it can be done!) The crowd watching your character also waves their arms and dances if you are doing a good job. If not, then the crowd leaves and your character gets pretty depressed. I hope that Konami comes out with more for XBOX!!!Note: there is one downside to this game. You find yourself singing the same songs over and over again. (60 songs really isn't that many to choose from)"
3,"Fun game, but can be challenging.","Karaoke Revolution is a great game, and it's challenging. Maybe a little too challenging. In this game, you have to get the pitch right, and sometimes that could be very difficult. Plus, the crowd will tend to boo you off the stage.. and it's such a heart stopping feeling. Or, aka, not a good feeling. But, when the crowd loves it, they clap, and dance. That's a good feeling.Heh. So this game is overall to me 3 stars. Fun, but challenging.-Melissa"
3,Poor Packaging,"At this price, I did not expect a high quality product. On that point it was only ""ok"", but adequate for my application. My gripe is the packaging. The pieces are so flimsy that they will not get through the shipping process undamaged without better packaging. In the first shipment pieces were bent - kinked - to the point of being unusable. Also, a required piece was missing. The company was very good at replacing the damaged and missing pieces, but the delay was annoying. And, the second shipment was also damaged. I used them anyways because I didn't want to wait any longer. A better box would help a lot."
4,We Salute You ... Sylvestor!,"Sylvestor was a pioneer of Disco and the gay club seen. Popular the world over. This is a great double CD package to start your collection. I was familar with Sylvestors work but I never had invested in a CD. I wanted a collection of all the hits before exploring his whole back catalogue. This CD was a good place to start and has not detered me from buying all his CD's. It's especially fun to hear Martha Wash and Izora Rhodes (The Weather Girls) featured so heavily on some of the tracks. Sylvestor, at times pushed them into lead vocals and for good reason. Both Martha and Izora were Diva's in their own right (in Martha Wash's case she still is a DIVA. Izora died a few years ago). I have all The Weather Girls (also known as Tons O' Fun) CD's and I'm a huge fan of Martha so I wanted to see where her career began. We salute you - Sylvestor!"
5,the one you should get,this a great greatest hits cd extended versions on nearly all of the songs if you want a greatest hits sylvester cd get this one you can't go wrong it's slamming
5,Best Jam Available on the Internet,"This is the real thing from the Huckleberry Capital of the World, northern Montana. There are real berries and not too much sugar. If you go to Kalispell, don't miss the chance to buy it locally."
5,A Chill-Out Album For The Holidays,"You knew this was coming, didn't you...a Christmas chillout selection. You know that it's a brave step when a label steps up to the plate to attempt to meet the challenge.Well Florida-based label Kriztal steps up to the plate and scores a home run with ""The Reindeer Room,"" a collection of both classic and original holiday tunes put forth from some of the brightest artists in the downtempo scene. These tunes are fresh takes on the classics that we all have had to put up with year-after-year-after-year.Hide those other Yuletide tiredness (okay, except maybe ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"") and go for different. ""The Reindeer Room"" brings out the ""chill"" in Christmas in a very good way."
5,Great Collection,All 3 of the Reigndeer Room CD's are great! I was looking for something a little more eclectic than traditional Christmas Music.....and these hit the spot.
1,"No sentimental feeling, too trendy & hip","If you drink latte, smoke pipe, and listen to college radio station; this CD maybe for you.When it comes to Christmas music, I am looking for that good old sentimental feeling. This CD has absolutely no holiday feeling. With this CD, I feel like I'm stuck in the college dorm-room with a girl with a lot of tattoos.The entire CD is a compilation of very trendy & hip variations of Christmas music. This is definitely not for folks looking for warm and fuzzy feeling of Christmas.If you are very young and hate old people. This CD maybe for you."
1,A disapointed reader,"This book of poems is both boring and disturbing. The earlier poems are near impossible to follow, most likely because you need some knowledge of this writers life... which is most likely a screwed up one. I say this based on the the latter poems in which a girl is getting raped... yet seems to enjoy it? Avoid this book!"
5,Looking for a great dance track? Well here it is!,"The last song from Cappella ""U R The Power of Love"" isn't just a great dance track; it's also one of my favorite. Are u a dance freak? I don't think so; not without this great track. Well maybe you are Cappella fan? Then this is a MUST for you, and this is the place where you can get it."
5,Latest Cappella release ever?,One of the greatest cd-single in Cappella's history. Never reached the top 100 hits or the dance/club hits. But it is still a great single.
5,A Must Read,"Motivational, inspirational, a fabulous, can't-put-it-down read.Share it with everyone you love and care about- help them to stay healthy."
5,Nothing Like It!,This book has been the most helpful book out there helping me understand what is gong on with my bisexual husband. All other books have been condemning and negative regarding married couples.Suresha does an excellent job showcasing all different men in an humanistic light. I highly recommend this book for both women and men interested in finding out more about male bisexuality.
5,A Must Read Book,My Life Between The Cross And The Bars Has a powerful and realistic message.I highly recommend this book to all human beings who are interested in a more productive society.It is informative as well as enlightening.Chaplin Castillo shears many of his ideas for prison reform with us
5,Read It and Grow,"My Life Between the Cross and the Bars is not just a book about federal prison ministry, but it is a marvelous chronicle of the inspirational life of Chaplain George Castillo. His gentle storytelling technique illuminates his generous spirit even when he tells of events with sad and tragic outcomes. This is an uplifting book that I found hard to put down. In fact, I finished it during an eleven-hour flight from Lisbon to New York and hungered for more stories from this gifted writer. Castillo hits every emotional chord in this autobiography---read it and grow."
2,Regret buying,"I recently had a mallet finger (torn extensor tendon on the distal joint) on my middle finger. I bought the sizing set because I didn't know what size I needed. Unless you also buy the heater to shape the split to hyperextend the joint, it's useless."
4,Glad it's finally here,"Although I never watched the show while it was on TV, I borrowed Season 1 from a friend when it was released and got hooked. I really was worried that there wasn't going to be anymore releases after Season 2 as they kept delaying the Season 3 release. The good news according to TVShowsOnDVD.com is that the studio is reporting that they are already hard at work on Season 4 and unofficially, they are hoping to release it in May or June of 2006. Let's hope that this pace continues for future seasons as well."
5,Yippie! About TIME!!!!!!!!!,"I have been waiting for this release for a LONG time. I like to think Im a huge fan. I know it isn't released yet, but I will be getting the first set on the stand.This show is something I could watch over and over and never grow bored with. Only thing I hope for is the release of ALL seasons faster than Season 3. So, when will season 4 be out? Thanks. You've made my day."
4,What about Sorenson?,I'm thrilled that they're finally releasing season 3 but I think that Sipowicz's character was HYSTERICAl when Danny Sorenson was his partner. My friend and I used to call it the Andy Sipowicz Comedy Hour. I REALLY REALLY hope they continue to release each season.SOON!
3,very satisfied,Purchased NYPD THIRD SEASON DVD used. I had a problem with disc #4. The company sent a postage paid envelope for return. They attempted to repair then issued full refund. Can't ask for any better than that. I will buy from them again. Thank You.
3,Horrible Production,"Big NYPD Blue Fan. Have 1 and 2 and love them. Just got Vol 3, and think a bad job was done in production. Why the change from dolby 4.0 to dolby 2.0.? Having sound only coming out of my front left and right rear speaker leaves something to be desired. Also the video quality appears grainy to me. Season three is great from the story aspect, but that's about it. Note to Fox: I'll be happy to pay a few more bucks for the former quality."
3,Audio Sync Problems on Season 3,"Has anyone else noticed that there are some audio sync problems on the season 3 DVD's? I just watched the episode ""The Backboard Jungle,"" and the sync was horrible. It's not consistent throughout, but at certain points the lips are moving several frames behind the audio.Not thrilled that they changed up the packaging, since it's nicer to have consistency for a complete collection, but as long as they'll release the DVD's I'm willing to deal with that.The audio problems aside, the content is still great."
2,Season Three Ripoff,"NYPD Blue fans beware!! Seasons One and Two contained all 22 season episodes on six one-sided disks with attractive graphics on the non-recorded side. Season Three, while slightly reduced in price, has 22 episodes on four double-sided disks.This is a much less attractive packaging presentation not withstanding the content being the same.I would have much preferred paying an extra two or three dollars for the more attractive and much more convenient one-sided recordings ."
4,Great but drives me nuts!,"I absolutely love this poster of my favorite movie. However, it drives me nuts that the one quote is incorrect. It's supposed to be ""this is my dance space, this is your dance space"" not ""this is your dance space, this is my dance space"""
5,FAST,I received this poster the day after it was shipped. Very fast and was packaged very nicely. I cant wait to hang it up!
5,Well worth the price...Has everything you need.,"This DVD recorder is perfect simply because you can use any format. You don't need to worry about which ""R"" mode to use for recording and its a Sony, so you won't get stuck with a cheap ""brand-X"" DVD burner. I bought the DRU-510A model at a local computer convention recently and immediately began using it with the bundled software.You can't go wrong buying this one."
3,TMR,"Hard to get, Can on time and in good condition. Gift for family member sound is good and wish I could get some more of the older items."
2,"Not impressed, if this was half the price, then its worth it","I'm a huge Cowboy Bebop fan, I own the series on DVD and preordered the movie a long time ago. I bought this book thinking that it would be full of cool facts and info that you wouldn't pick up from the actual DVD, but it's really just a synopsis of each episodes with a bunch of pictures from each episode. There are a few pages of extras, but they are mostly some rough sketches and short bios, nothing really worth the price of this book.If this was half the price, it might be worth it, but even then I would only suggest this for the absolute collector that must have every Cowboy Bebop related piece of merchandise out there, regardless of quality. For the casual fan, or even the more fanatic, it's simply not worth the money."
3,A little miffed,"I love Cowboy Bebop, and I'm very happy to have the book, but I would have been far more pleased if the poster contained inside hadn't been ripped in half. Shippers? Please be a little more careful when you box the merchandise, huh?"
2,Disappointed,"When I saw this book at the local [store], I was really excited because I love this show and already own all the dvd's. After shelling out [money] for it, however, I realized that it really wasn't worth it. The bulk of the book is made up of summaries and screenshots from the first 5 episodes. This might have been cool, but it was better actually watching the episodes, which I had already done atleast five times. So even though the pictures are cool and there is some information on the characters I didn't know, this book is for hardcore fans/geeks only... those who need to know all the personal information about each and every minor character. Final verdict: Only buy this if you are completely obsessed with the series and have already purchased all the dvd's. Maybe if you find the book used on amazon ... it would be a good deal, but otherwise you're just going to be disappointed."
3,The game was decent but forgettable,"This game was ok....I played it for a few days and I moved on quickly to another title....I did not really like it....The gameplay was really boring...all you do is move the stick and hit ""Monsters""GraphicsWere good for its time...there were many glitchs with the graphicsStoryThe story is weak the deepest it goes it that you have to save the village from monster"
5,Capcom struck a winner,If you think capcom dosnt make good games then you need to check out this game. It should be the best game of 2004. Lots of fun.If you dont like games that take for ever then i dont think you will want to get this game. Rent it first. If you have broad band then i highly sugest this game. I here people get this game and 2 or 3 others for themselves but only play monster hunter. It is because it is so adictive to play. I cant seem to put the controler down. There are so many twists.Even if it is a great game it still has flaws.Flaws:-no multiplayer offline-the camra is not the bestGreats:-Online is so fun because you can do even more stuff then offline-monsters have weaknesses too-there are so many weapons and armors it is hard to get them allSo overall I give it a strong 5*'s.
4,Offline is fun too.,"First of all, I'm only to give the game four stars because that's what I think it deserves in terms of playing offline(village). Everything looks great, character creation is diverse, the music is beautiful and kind of wierd at the same time, and ambient noises are-i think-the most redeeming quality since no other game developer has found time to match MH. Aside from that, expect alternative, albeit tight gameplay and interesting ""side-activities"" like fishing, roasting meat on a spit, and combining items to make different kinds of herbs and bait, as well as any variation of the game's weapons you want. Sadly, I have neither a Network Adapter nor a USB Keyboard, however Christmas is nearby so I hope to get an even more amazing game experience come December when I go online."
4,Cooling Fan Stand,I purchased two of these and they work great. The one I'm using when I plug it in the fan will make a loud noise. Not all the time...but sometimes. It was ok the first couple weeks after I got it. Hopefully it doesn't mean the fan is going as it stops a little while after it is plugged in...a little annoying but if it continues to work it will be great. I don't know what the return policy would be. Even if I returned it when they would plug it in it probably wouldn't make the noise. So I have my fingers crossed hoping it continues to work. I have to give it 4 stars as the one my daughter is using is working great.
3,Belkin F5L001 Laptop Cooling Stand,"Belkin F5L001 Laptop Cooling StandThis fan worked flawlessly for about 20 days. Then, on laptop start up, the fan started making a ratcheting noise as though the blades were striking something. The first time I heard this I almost had a heart attack thinking my hard drive was failing. The noise lasts about 45 seconds after which the fan works fine (until the next morning's start up when it happens all over again), with just the low noise of rushing air. I don't see the fan blades striking anything but the noise happens no matter how the pad is positioned - vertically, horizontally, upside down, etc."
5,highly effective,"Purchased for a MacBook Pro, and as advertised, it does a fantastic job of cooling. Favorable both in its design and style; runs quiet, secures and effectively cools the laptop, the power cord is stowable, and looks good."
4,"""Cool""ing stand","A very nice unit, I like the design that blows air on the laptop instead of trying to pull air away. Like a fan you would use to cool yourself. Very quiet and light weight. The only things I could think of to improve would be adjustability and maybe a different color other than white. Otherwise a great unit."
1,Breaks quickly,Not worth the money. It broke in a matter of months. Take heed of the hundreds of one star reviews and spend your money elsewhere.
1,Broke way too quickly,I used the pad for two months and it broke. I wouldn't recommend it. It did only a fair job of keeping my laptop fromoverheating. It wasn't really powerful enough to do the job right though..and now it's broke and I'm having to put outanother thirty bucks for a new one...that will not be a belkin.
2,Design Flaw in fan... the only moving part!,"There was a design flaw in the fan on both of my units. I purchased two of these at the same time, and both of the units had fan blades break off. After the blades broke, the fans jammed on the broken blades. That being said, please note that my wife and I both have nice laptop tables to set our laptops on, so there is no chance of accidental damage to the cooler, or our laptops.The only reason I gave the cooler two stars is because I was able to disassemble both F5L001 units (quite easily) and remove the broken fan blades. After that, I got them to limp along for quite a while. However, they were more noisy (due to the fans being unbalanced) after I ""fixed"" them. One lost two blades, and even vibrated some. They both died only months into their relatively short lives."
2,Below average lifespan,"This cooling base looks good and has good features like nonslip pads and a ""lockaway storage"" for the USB cord when not in use. However only after 6 months it only works if I jigger the cord a certain way and at a certain angle. Three months later no matter how much I jigger or Fonzie smack it, the fan stops spinning. Kaput.I am very unsatisfied about it's performance as it as a short lifespan. Regret buying it and would not recommend."
2,Not great,"The ""pad"" (it's more of a stand) is bulky, a bit loud, and doesn't do a great job of cooling. After about a year the fan stopped working, so I would definitely recommend something else."
2,"Worked ok for a brief time, then failed.","This product failed a short time after I got it. The fan seized, and then lost a couple of blades. It still works, but it's noisy."
2,Belkin Laptop Fan :(,"This is the second laptop fan I have purchased and I chose Belkin because of the quality behind the brand. However, this turned out to be a waste of money. It is very cheaply made and the plastic fan blades have almost all broken off. They get caught in the fan grooves. Also, it is very noisy. I would NOT recommend this product."
1,Both broke. Wouldn't buy again.,Bought one for each laptop and both quit working correctly. One would only work after bending the cord a certain way and the other one made a super loud noise after a while. Poor quality.
1,Can be dangerous to Laptops,"I should have read the reviews before I bought this locally, I would have gone with something else instead. Not only is it noisy, it also killed my USB ports. The first time I tried to use it, I got a message from Windows that USB device had malfunctioned. Since then, every time I bring my laptop out of sleep, hibernate, or power up I get this message. Even when there's nothing plugged in, I get this message. Furthermore, I can't use any USB devices (mouse, memory sticks, printers, etc) at all because Windows can't detect anything at all. The USB ports, all of them, are dead.Not very happy!!! Belkin owes me about $500 for replacement laptop board, and the next laptop cooler I get will either be battery powered or powered from AC/car adapter and not from USB port at all!!!"
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!,I recieved this cooling pad for christmas I used it for about three days then the fan just stopped i plugged it back it and it still didnt work.Also I have a large laptop and it was hard to balance it on this becauseit was so small
1,Product is dead!!!,I bought it one month back and now it is dead.. Fan is not working... I thought Belkin will hav a nice product.. It really disappointed me..Think twice before buying this product.. from this seller.. I would certainly not recommend this item to anyone...
3,"Works, but I'm mad at it.","Totally cools my MacBook Pro, in fact, I wish it had speed settings so I could run it quieter and I wouldn't freeze my crotch (it's winter). I end up plugging it in and out all the time. The single fan in the middle is blocked by whatever surface you have it sitting on unless you open the little (hard to open) flip-up foot in the back, and that foot has NO lock, so it closes right up when you put the thing down. Who designed this, what were they thinking, and did they ever try to use it themselves? I keep putting my thumb into the fan blades as I'm trying to open that foot. I'm never going to love this thing.Don't we feel stupid for buying laptops that are thin & cool looking, but too thin to run without making our laps sweaty? Now we have to have this extra bulky item to go with it!"
3,its good but not perfect..,"the only thing i really dislike about this product is that its not really made to be on your lap. If you have this as a lapdesk, with the fan going, the only way the fan will actually draw air is if you have the flap up that elevates the stand. If you dont have this flap up, then the fan will rub agianst your legs and draw no air. Still you can use the stand without having the fan going with the flap down and avoid the heating pad. Also check the measurements for the stand vs your laptop.. my laptop actually hangs over the stand about an inch on each side."
3,"Very handy, but fragile construction",I find that I use this thing all the time. I just wish one of the little fan blades hadn't broken off the second week that I owned it. It's still cooling my laptop but it vibrates a little from ill balance.
1,Plugged it in and loud buzz and the blades snapped off...lol,"I'd have rated it lower if I could have. I just bought this p.o.s. at our local Meijers' store. I thought I'd surprise my wife with something to cool her notebook down. I got it out of the packaging, plugged it in, and wham-o the thing started buzzing loud and in literally 2 seconds, the blades popped off the fan. I didn't have enough time to even unplug the POS. This is a waste of money and I'm glad it was only 20 dollars, but I'll probably still take it back to Meijer's on my next trip there. I can't believe belkin is selling this thing with their name on it. Last thing I'll ever buy from them.Don't waste your money.Mark"
1,Not even a good doorstop.. total waste,"I had this cooling pad for exactly 2 days before it just died on me. For those two days it worked okay, not too noisy compared to my last cooling pad. The cord is too short though, I had trouble getting it under the laptop to reach to my usb port. I bought this for $25, it's going back to the store. I can't recommend anything Belkin makes, nothing ever lasts."
2,broke after a few months use,"i liked the design of this laptop cooling fan. i bought it when i bought a new computer. so oftertimes, i did not even plug in the fan to the USB. just the design helped diffuse hot air from the laptop. when i did plug in the usb power, it was very noisy. after a few months, the 3.5mm jack in the back of the cooling pad fell into the unit. i was not rough with this unit, and it broke way too quickly. i am still using it, just as a $30 platform, not as a laptop cooling pad."
1,DO NOT RECOMMEND!,"I purchased this cooling pad in mid-July because my laptop was over heating, and because i wanted to elevate so i would be able to use it for my lap. First of all, the fan sounds like a jet engine. However, since my laptop is also loud, i was able to over look this, however my mom couldn't stand the pad because the fan was just to loud! second, you can't have it plugged in, and the feet in because it crimps the wire, and the wire is just BARELY long enough to reach, but can still be awkward, so i can't really use it on my lap. Finally, the damn stand broke after 4 months of use. i was sitting there typing a paper and the little feet just snapped off. do not buy this, it is not worth the money!"
2,Is this really a top-rated cooling pad?,"Well, that's what it said on the box anyway. I didn't have time to order one, so I picked up one of these at Wal-Mart (cost more than amazon).It looked a bit odd, but pickings were slim at my neighborhood Wal-Mart.I got it home, plugged it into my laptop and sat down. Things went downhill from there. First, the little ""stand"" kept falling down and it starting making a grinding noise. So, I shifted around a little and the noise subsided a bit, but not much. Then the fan started getting louder and louder.Bottom line: It DOES cool the laptop, but it will probably annoy you constantly. If it is sitting on a hard surface it isn't so bad; otherwise, be prepared, cursing will begin shortly after first use."
2,Works when it wants to work!,"Purchased this Belkin fan 2 months ago. The first 3 weeks it was quiet and working well. Began to get louder and louder as weeks progressed. Sometimes it just makes noise and blows nothing, ugh! I have to plug ad unplug it to get it to work now.I would think this product would last at least a year. I have many other Belkin products and love them. This one is a piece of garbage. I will need to go purchase another and it will not be a Belkin!"
1,Worked for a short time.,I bought this product for my laptop and it worked great for the first 2 weeks. Then the fans just quit. I even made sure there wasn't dust around the fans by blowing them out with a can of duster and still nothing! I wouldn't waste my money!
2,Fan started making motor-like noise within a month,Note that I did not use this fan constantly and I owned it for only a month. The fan started sounding motor-ish only after short uses.
1,Good for about a month,"Worked well for a little while. Then it started to get really noisy, then it would randomly sputter to a stop for no reason. For all the noise it made I might as well have had a lawn mower in my room and it didn't even do a good job of cooling my laptop. Terrible product, I need to buy a new cooling pad but am no longer willing to trust anything that Belkin makes."
2,Works great... when it works,"This worked great and prevented my laptop from overheating and shutting down. I took my laptop to my sister's and brought this with me in my computer bag. The fan stopped working, I guess it couldn't handle one trip. Considering it's designed specifically for use with a portable PC, you'd think it shouldn't be a problem carrying it in a protected computer bag. But from what I'm reading in reviews on this site and others, the fan or the USB or something just aren't very durable or are flawed or something. I'm hoping I can exchange it at Wal-mart where I bought it, it's only been a month or so since I purchased it."
2,Not recommended for daily laptop users,"This product lasted exactly 2 weeks of daily use.Fan noise: not noticeableUnit construction: flimsyConnectivity: okCooling capacity: not goodAfter 2 weeks of daily use the product no longer turned on. Looked for any issues with fan, tested USB port connectivity, but no luck-the product did not work. To the trash it went --Not recommended.-Complete waste of money!"
1,Doesn't last,"We bought a few of these as Christmas gifts. The two that have actually been used regularly both broke down and stopped working about 1 month later. I was happy with the job they did keeping the laptops cool, but to have both of them break down after a few weeks is completely unacceptable. I would highly recommend looking closely at some other options before considering this one, I'm sorry that I didn't."
2,Does not last long.....,"I purchased this item for my husband. He loved it, but then the fan started making noise. The compartment that holds the fan is not well designed. With use, it changes shape, allowing the fan blades contact with the outer frame. Accordingly, the fan scrapes the frame/or stops altogether. Certainly needs better construction. As is, it works very well---until you put a laptop on it."
1,Good until it breaks!,"It lasted about a year and the the fan stopped working. It was also hard on my computer. Save your money and get a better one. This is the last Belkin item I buy. No matter the product by Belkin, they all seem to break or fall apart. I have finally learned my lesson!"
1,No fan,"I ordered this cooling pad in anticipation of a new laptop at work. I got it Friday. The fan is no longer working... It has many features I like, but if it doesn't work, what good is it!"
1,Would only work well for a few months,"I got this product as a gift a few months ago. For at least 3 months it worked well, the fans weren't quiet and it would sometimes get caught under the blanket if used while you're on the bed but it was doing the job and actually cooling the laptop. But all of sudden it decided it would stop working completely for no reason what so ever. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Way to loud,I purchased this laptop cooling pad. It is not as good as i expected it to be. The fan on the inside rubs against the plastic cover making it an extremely noisy product. I do not recumbent buying this.
2,It's alright.,"Nothing to really write home about. I've had this for roughly a year or so now and am going to buy a better one now.Pros: It works and isn't too loud (most of the time).Cons: I have to hit it a couple times when it starts up because the fan wants to bind up and make an annoying grinding sound. There is only a single fan, and it's pretty small. Doesn't put as much air out as some other coolers I've used, but for simple uses it works fine, unfortunately my laptop fans work fine for simple uses too.I would definitely suggest buyers to continue looking for other cooling pads on amazon, there are definitely better for the same price range."
1,sucks,I've bought this product before and it lasted at least 3 months. This time it only lasted 29 days..not enough time for a refund....urgg!!!
4,Ok,"The power cord is a little short, but still works. Overall its just fine, especially for such a good price."
2,While it lasts,"Not bad while it lasts. USB cable is a little short, a tight reach on my Lenovo IdeaPad (not a big laptop). Two plastic fan blade busted after a few months. The fan was always a bit loud. Fan is now out of balance and worthless. I use it unplugged until I find something built better."
1,Piece of junk has a lousy motor,"The motor stopped working on the first one I bought after a few weeks. The motor would seize up with an ugly loud noise and stop running. Sometimes I could get it going again by sticking a pencil in to turn the fan blades, but after a few days that stopped working. I exchanged the product for a new one, and now (a couple of months later) the motor is seizing up again. When the motor works, the product is fine. But the motors seem faulty."
2,No longevity,"While I liked the design of this model, it died completely after only a year of light use. My niece also has the same model; she's had it only since Christmas 2009 and it's already making the ""noises of imminent death."""
1,Do Not Buy this Product,I bought this so called cooling pad about a month ago now and just after maybe two days of using it the thing broke and has never came on again. I am never buying another product from Belkin. So I advise you to not get this.
1,Junk -- All three pads broke within four months,"I once bought three of these pads at the same time, one for each of our laptops.The fans on all three went into intermittent failure within four months.They're junk."
2,Piece of junk,"Yes, this will cool your laptop, but - for how long?A laptop is meant to allow mobility, flexibility, and let you get away from your desk. But this cooling pad is so fragile (aka cheaply and poorly made) that if it is handled with anything but kit gloves the fan will either get something caught in it or some part of it will bend and it will become so loud that you will not be able to use it. I have mine running right now because my laptop overheats so badly, but it is ridiculously loud...unless I hold it vertically, which, how the heck could i use it then?This has happened to me with three different fans after 1-2 weeks of use. The only reason I buy them is because there are so few cooling options.I guess if you plan to use your laptop as a desktop and never move it, it may last a little longer, but I would not reccomend this product to anyone else. Ever. And man, for 30 bucks, it's a huge ripoff. (I bought mine at retail outlets.)"
1,Works great...for a short time.,"I have had two of these cooling pads now. The first one broke after the first use (about 2 hours). I exchanged it and the second one broke after about a month. I am seriously unhappy with this purchase. It doesn't matter how well this item works if it can't stand up to normal use! The blades of the fan snap off, rendering the pad useless. CHEAP MATERIALS! :(EDIT: OK I exchanged my laptop pad AGAIN and it broke after about 4 hours of use. That is THREE of these cheap things!! This time I am getting my money back. And using it to invest in a better cooling pad, I think, because I really could use one that actually works."
2,"Try others -- The fan keeps stopping when kept on floor, table or lap","Not worth it..I pat $13 at Frys...but just googled and found in 2009 it was selling for $8. This is not a good choice cooling pad as the fans stops due to resistance from its cover when the pad is kept on table, floor or on yr thights (while the laptop is on lap)...Thus, I feel its not a usable products....There are much better, well designed, with USB ports and cheaper products out there...go for them."
1,HORRIBLE,"This thing lasted a couple of months and just stopped. It never did work very well, but it just died finally. The first one I had died on the second day, so I returned it thinking it was just that one...no such luck. Belkin should be ashamed to even put this product out there."
2,Not the best...,"I bought this to replace a cheaper pad that I had bought a couple of years ago. After looking for a couple weeks, I decided on this one. I've had Belkin products before and have mostly like them. This pad is pretty large which allows the laptop to slide off most times. There is one fan in the middle that only diverts the air down rather than off to the sides like my old one did. The stand that unfolds does not stay open very well so is pretty much worthless. Since this keeps folding back down, the fan is usually in contact with whatever surface I have it on so it does next to nothing. Also, whatever you do, don't grab the pad and the computer at the same time. When I do, the fan starts to make a weird sound and the only way to make it stop is to unplug the cord from the computer. I'm really not happy with this pad and would like to replace it, but I don't want to pay for another."
2,Cheap plastic legs break off if your laptop is beefy,"This would have been a great choice if not for one major problem: The folding leg/prop is thin, cheap plastic, and my G50VT was just too heavy for it. The hinge snapped one day, and with the curve of the device you can't use it without that piece, because without it the fan is pressed against the desktop and won't work.This might be good for lightweight computers, but 16"" or 17"" gaming laptops should probably avoid it. The fan's decent, but the plastic around it is just cheap garbage that won't stand up to regular use.It's certainly not worth the high price tag, anyway. I was very upset that my thirty dollar purchase didn't last three months, and now it's only useful if I prop something under it, or place it on top of my laptop computer when I'm using an external keyboard.There are better choices. It's embarrassing that this product has the Belkin name on it."
2,Poor Quality Fan,"I had this for MAYBE a year when the fan started making noise. Then, the stand just snapped one day. Very dissapointing quality."
1,Worst product I ever bought,This is the worst product I have *ever* bought. Fan started making loud noise in two months and it completely stopped working in another month. I would think twice before buying anything from Belkin again.
1,Not worth it!,"This fan started out great. Worked well, exactly what I needed. Within 1 month the fan had worked itself lose, making an awful noise. Almost immediately one of the fins on the fan cracked which made even more noise.Was able to glue the fin along the crack which improved things, but a month later the stand snapped off the bottom.This fan is going in the trash as soon as my new (different) fan arrives. Don't waste your money, this is a very badly made product."
2,Works but sounds like an airplane.,Don't get me wrong - this laptop fan works great for cooling BUT it is so loud I stopped using it. It sounds like an airplane taking off. It's not just a quiet hum like it should be. Way too loud.
2,Good while it worked,"I bought my laptop cooler from a large chain store for Christmas. I use my laptop every day, and the cooler worked great for about two weeks. The fan stopped working. I can use it to keep the laptop off my legs, but it doesn't take the heat away.It worked great, while it worked. It just didn't last long.Sorry!"
2,good but short lived,"I bought this about two months ago and the power outlet was not properly glued and so I cannot insert the power jack inside. Though the cooling is the best among all similarly priced items (belive me, I bought four laptop coolers before this one), this died quickly for its price"
2,works great-at first...,"I bought this laptop cooling stand about three months ago. I have a five yr old HP laptop that was getting hot after several hours of use. I liked this model, it was inexpensive, had a fan, and seemed t fit my needs. It worked great at first, although it is a little noisy. But by the second month one of the fan blades broke on it and it did not work as well. Now two of the cheaply made fan blades broke and it is twice as loud as before and shuts off intermittently. Shame really, it is lightweight and holds my laptop well.I am looking for a different one...Jenn"
2,Started out nice but now tricky,"I liked the look of this cooler because it left space between my laptop and the fan. It worked great at first but after about 6 months, the fan kept on cutting out. I took it apart and figured out part of the problem was the connection at the back of the cooling but even after re-gluing this piece in place, the connection still hasn't been right since. I have to constantly move the cord to get a good link so that the fan continues to work."
3,Fan get nosisy,"At first the cooling stand works well and my 15"" hp laptop fits nicely on it but after a few weeks the fan get extreme noisy when started up. I have to unplug it and plug in again. Would not recommended as many other people also have this problem."
4,Nice & Cool,"Works great on a desk...ok in your lap....not as good on the bed, but still better than nothing. Over all, I'm satisfied."
2,Can't stand up to pressure.,"I love this fan, but it has problems. The plastic it is made out of is a softer plastic than it needs. The wave design causes a lot of pressure to be placed directly on the fan from the bottom if you aren't using the awkward stand.The result is - snapped off fan blades. I've had two snap off in the last few months. I opened it up and removed the broken blades, and it still works, but now it vibrates and pushes less air (the two broken blades occurred right next to each other unfortunately).Despite this flaw that will surely soon see the permanent death of this thing, it does an amazing job of keeping the laptop cool (the laptop ends up colder than when it is off). It is also very quiet, until the blades start breaking off.Sadly, I can't recommend it, as I am in the process of searching for a replacement.Note: If you use the awkward stand, there should be no pressure on the fan, and thus, no breakage."
3,Ok but too small,"The product works fairly well but it is way too small in width for a 15.4"" laptop. The feet on my laptop don't sit well on it at all. Not only that, but the fan is easily obstructed when used on your lap or without the stand fully extended. A bit disappointed with this one."
2,Very Noisy Fan,"The fan is very noisy and lound sometimes. I don't know where the problem comes from. But if I have a chance, I will definitely not choose this product."
4,a little unclear,"Bought three units of this product, surprisingly I got the delivery in two boxes. One box contained 2 units and the other contained one unit. What surprised me was that two of the units was a little different in the model that what I had ordered and one was the one that I had ordered.The seller should make it a point that they do confirm with the customer before delivering the product."
4,Works well,Works very well for keeping my laptop cool. The fan has been occasionally noisy at start up but a simple tap in the center and it quiets right down. Good product at a fair price.
4,"Great, but not transportable","This is an excellent product. It blows air directly on the bottom of your computer which definitely makes a difference. For those of you who are HP users like me, this is a great product is you suffer from an overheating computer. In fact, if you own an HP, you probably have a heating problem and don't even know it. The facts are simple, computers run much better when they are cooler, and this is a very cheap and effective product.However, do not make the mistake of trying to transport it. Because of its curved base it is very hard to protect in a suitcase. When TSA goes through your suitcase it only takes one adjustment and subsequent hit to loosen the cables inside and break the fan. :(But the product for me lasted nearly 2 years of use nearly every day for at least 5+ hours of daily use if not more."
2,Small Computers Only,"I bought this because I wanted a smaller, more manageable cooling pad, but this product ended up being too small. I have a 15"" Macbook Pro, and getting it to stay on the cooling pad was a balancing act. The usb connecter cord was also fairly short, although I did like the storage space for it underneath the pad. My other big frustration with this cooling pad was the optional supporting panel that was supposed to help prop my computer up at a better angle. It didn't have anything to lock it in place when I used it, and it kept collapsing back whenever I used it.To sum it up, I am not a fan, and it was so inconvenient that I only used it once or twice before I went back to my old cooler. However, people with smaller laptops may have a better experience than I did."
1,How a poor designed item can be sold everywhere,"Maybe it is because is cheap, I don't know. But everywhere I see, this damn base is sold, many times as the unique option.The design is very poor, who invented it never gave it a try. The retractable leg does not keep secure in place, so if you slightly push forward your laptop, the bae colapses. And because the USB cable does not have a secure outward path, gets damage every time the lid closes. And with the lid closed, the base is stable as a ball, because its unusefull curve shape in the bottom. I think also that is raises the laptop too much in the front part, where is not needed.The lid also broke because a desing problem on a weak point.The fan is very noisy.So, for a piece of garbage that has only four parts, and all 4 parts are a disaster (fan, cable, lid and base), Belkin should retire this from lids and fire their designers.Do not buy it, nor take it even if is for free (or prepare yourself to get angry and bored by the noise)."
2,Bad USB cable connection to cooling pad,"I am on my second Belkin cooling pad. Threw the first one away. Took the second one apart as it had the very same problem - found the small plastic holding area into which the small end of the USB ""fits"" does not securely hold the USB cable and this loose connection results in the pad not working most of the time, or intermittently. Very cheaply made with an ongoing problem which SHOULD never have occurred. This is tinker-toy design and I think Tommy in the basement with the Toys R Us engineering set he got for his birthday is in charge of this product's R&D AND quality control. Would not ever consider buying another Belkin product."
2,Broken twice,"It was my 1st cooling pad that I bought from wallmart. First I bought a white one and shipped to my home. It started making too discomforting noise after using it a week or 2. Then I changed it to a black one. And even I did not use it a week, when I returned home, saw one of the wings were broken and it was making noise. So, I just disconnected the usb..Guess, its only good to elevate notebook and thats all for me. Disappointed with this Belkin product."
1,Don't bother,I bought one of these exactly one week ago and I just threw it in the trash. Several of the blades broke off and the fan was extremely noisy. It's garbage.
5,Good product,Got this for my son who started tech. school last week. He has been using it sense we recieved it and it works great. A new feature on his hp laptop allows him to see his cpu usage and we can feel how cool the laptop is. I would most certainly recommend this to other people.
4,Does the job,"Ok i got this cooler pad on a local store to give it a try, It actually does a good job the fan cools my laptop perfectly so i can put my video card at max and use this thing on mi lab and the laptop won't overheat.I will resume what i think of the pad:Pro's:1. Fan does the job ( it puts air on the laptop not tries to suck it out which doesn't work so this is GREAT)2. Is comfortable to use and fits a 15 inch laptop barely XD3. Looks goodCon's:1. Fan is a little noisy but bearable, I always use headphones or a rather ridiculously loud sound system so no probs with me there.2. If the tab that hold the cable is closed be sure to have the cable all inside or it may damage it. My sis broke hers like that XD just leave always openSo that's it, I think this cooler does a good job for a good price. enjoy o/"
2,not strong enough to hold on!,"The cooling pad worked for a bit-less than a year, then the fan ""spokes"" started to scratch against either side oft the cooling pad, causing it to become very noisy. Now after having one of the spokes come off, I have to move them around with a pen or something to get them started. I don't know what happened.. NEVER dropped it! And the fan strength is not strong, leavng my laptop still pretty warm. :( Wish it was better.. especially after the amount I paid!"
1,This Cooler Makes Me Hot,I have had two of these coolers. Both of them are now dead. The fan on the first cooler became increasingly loud as it was hitting the outer shell of the cooler. I replaced it. The second one worked great for a couple months then went completely dead. The flip down leg on the back folds way too easily when using the laptop which drops everything (the pad and laptop) to the desk. Why I bought two I have no idea except it was cheap. I definitely do not recommend this cooler.
2,Not for All Laptops,"After searching for days to find a laptop cooling fan that was cost effective and reliable, i came across this laptop cooler. I have a macbook pro and this cooling fan doesn't cool a mac. The fan blow cool air from the center to the sides of the bottom of the laptop. I found fans that create a negative pressure under the laptop draw warm air away from the bottom of the laptop. Unfortunately, with this cooling fan, cool air is not able to reach the hottest parts of the laptop. (over by the mag safe power adapter)"
2,Can't hear my computer over the noise!,"Very noisy from day one. USB ports worked well for about 4 months, and then they sputtered and died. The design does lift my gaming laptop to allow for better air circulation. It does not sit firmly on my desk; when pushed back, the rear leg folds up and drops the laptop smashing the USB hub in the rear.Item is used on a desk and is cleaned of dust weekly.Product would be improved if fan were quieter, foldable rear leg could be locked in place and USB ports were not in danger of bearing force of laptop falling when leg collapses."
1,Not a functional or realistic lap cooler,"I've looked several places for this lap pad because I liked the way it looked. Unfortunately, it didn't function in a way that I expected. Flaw #1, the under fan stand doesn't stay in a locked upright position so with the slightest move of the hand the entire laptop falls off. Flaw #2, the one fan doesn't prove enough strength to actually keep my laptop cool; placement and power of the fan is pointless. These two flaws are a deal breaker for me...this cool pad is going back TODAY."
2,Not a long term investment,"I got this cooling stand because my laptop has a proclivity for running hot. It worked great initially, and the fan was definitely coming on less. Then about a month and a half after purchase it died. So from my experience I really can't recommend it for others."
3,"Great design, but fan can be unusually loud sometimes","This cooling pad has a very nice design and really does a good job to elevate your laptop computer to a better position for typing and viewing. The fan does indeed do a good job with cooling the laptop. Before I got this cooling pad, my keyboard would always be uncomfortably warm to the touch. Now, they stay cool almost all the time and typing seems a bit easier. The pad also only requires one USB plug, and it works fine when plugged into a non-powered USB hub.The only problem I am encountering (hence the 3-star rating) is 50% of the time I go to turn on my laptop, the fan will start humming very loudly. Unusually loud. To solve this problem, I have to unplug then plug back in the USB plug several times until the noise goes away and the fan's hum is much softer and more ambient. I don't know what makes the fan sound so loud sometimes but it is a minor annoyance and doesn't seem to affect the cooling pad otherwise."
1,cheap plastic blades broke in a week,"The concept for this cooling pad is really great. I loved it for about two days, but then the cheap plastic blades in the fan starting breaking off one at a time. If they made them out of metal, this cooling pad would be fantastic."
2,"Works well for a few months, but didn't last long","I purchased this back in February. We were very happy with it - it actually cooled our laptop quickly and efficiently, wasn't noisy as I feared, and actually made it much more comfortable to use the laptop since we weren't burning our legs.However, after just under 3 months of use, it began to make loud rattling sounds whenever we used it. It also only worked intermittently, and eventually, stopped working at all.For the money, I'll say that you do get what you pay for - I had high hopes for this cooling stand, and was pleased with it when it worked, but will be doing a bit more research and will spend a little more money to find a new one, if necessary."
2,Short Life Span,I liked the way this cooling stand worked at first but after a couple of months it quit working. I'd recommend looking for another product.
2,Eh..not impressive.,"I have got to say that this Laptop cooling pad was not among the best I have ever owned. Nearly two weeks later after purchase the cooling pad became very loud and I dicontinued use due to the noise. I would not recommend this cooling pad, unless you plan to use it somewhere loud like a factory or something lol."
2,An objective review of the Belkin Cooling fan,"These are the pros and cons of this Belkin Cooler. I have 2 of them so I am the best person to speak on this:Pros:1. Very modern design. Without the fan being on, the channel under the laptop lets the heat escape, and provides ventilation.2. Inexpensive. It doesnt cost much really.Cons:1. The fans on these are very cheap. They will at times, be very noisy. It sounds like the plastic inside the fan is scraping against the motor. Very annoying. Both of them have this issue.2. The stand to hold up the cooling fan doesnt lock. So, if you accidentaly push your laptop forward, the stand underneath will fold so your laptop will crash to the ground. Very dangerous if you have sensitive data.Summary:It looks good, just needs some work on quality and ergonomics."
3,laptop cooling fan,This unit could work better if it had more air volumn. My laptop still get pretty warm after a period of time.
3,Belkin F5L001 Laptop Cooling Stand,The product does keep the computer cooler and it's a worthwhile purchase. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't always keep the computer steady. I prefer not using it but will if the temperatures demand it.
2,Isn't worth the money,"I'm on my 2nd one. It's fairly quiet and seems to cool the laptop but, after about a month of use the fan started making noise like it was off balance. The only way to stop it was tap it several times. As long as it was running it was fine. Turn off the power and then add power it would make noise again. Tap it again and it would be quiet. One tap too many and the cage broke, so I bought another. After a month or so it does the same thing, fan gets noisy and I have to tap it again and again to shut it up. Going to buy a different type later. Will not be getting another one of these."
4,Keep it cool keep it nice,"I did some researching before buying this product, and I haven't been disapointed. Its true the amount of temp reduced its low, only around 10-12 degrees overall (Fahrenheit) but it puts the MacBook Pro higher from the surface, which gives it more ventilation its not that loud compared to other similar products or to the MBP itself which when the fans are full power its quite loud. The color was also perfect it comes in black or white, most laptop have a darker color below, mine thou is aluminum gray which means the white color of mine was perfect specially when I use a white ceramic candy looking desk for my computer system. I recommend this product to anyone, thou there may be better but the price beats it. Also check out if you have overheating issues one with double fans similar to this one made by Belkin also."
3,so-so,"This cooling pad is very effective. My computer used to heat up pretty fast and I had to turn it off every three hours to let it cool down. With this cooling pad my computer can run all day and doesn't heat up that much....BUT I bought the cooling pad in June, now it's the end of September and I already have to throw this one out and buy and a new one, because, first of all, it's now making so much noise that I simply can't stand it, second, one of the little wings of the fan broke off. So I'd give it five stars for effectiveness, but the durability could certainly be much better!"
1,Poor fan,"the fan broke after a month. The plastic fan will hit contantly with the walls..and the sound well, you can imagine. Very poor construction..Do not recommended..."
1,disappointed,I have not yet received my item. I place my order in early Sept. and I haven't even received any feedback to where my package is. For some reason after it left Elk Grove Village and was sent to Chicago it was sent back to Elk Grove Village and some how routed to New York then back to Elk Grove. I wonder where it will go next.I reated it one star even though I haven't received my item because it won't let me post my comment without me rating
3,Meh.,"My brother and I both got these cooling pads for Christmas last year for our new laptops. They both died within 2-3 months. Not worth the money, you're just going to end up buying a different one."
1,Horrible product,"The second I opened it, one of the blades fell off the fan. I wish I had turned around and taken it back then. Every time I set it down anywhere, another blade falls off. Now I'm afraid to breath around it, because I'm down in blades by 50%. All it does is sit on my desk, I occasionally have to move my laptop like people often do and end up having to pick a fallen blade out of it so the others can still move.Other than that, the fan works fine and offers enough circulation. I just wish they decided to make it out of something more durable than the hips of 80 old women with osteoporosis."
3,not exactly what I expected,"The fan does keep the laptop much cooler but I thought it had a stand on the back of it to lift the laptop at an angle. The stand pulls out, is not very high and does not lock in place so if you move the laptop the right way the little stand will collapse"
4,Excellent gadget,Niffy little cooling device for a laptop. Small enough to carry everyehwere and fits in my laptop case. Easy to use and does a good job. What more can you ask for?
3,"Okay ""As Is"" -- Better with modification","This product does a great job cooling my 17 inch laptop. However, the fold out legs don't lock into place and collapse far too easily. I wedged in a couple of bobby pins to keep the legs from collapsing, and I am much happier now. This laptop cooler is designed to sit on a flat surface. I have found it works best to put a book or flat surface between the stand and my lap."
2,Poorly designed chill pad,"It worked great for a few months but was very noisy. Then the cord connection to the pad kept coming loose. My fiance had to keep krazy gluing it together to make it stick and run. Eventually, it died and had to replace."
3,Noisy and flimsy but cools fine,"The Belkin laptop cooling pad is flimsy and not very well made. The connector on the base unit (where the USB cord connects) popped inside the unit within a few weeks of use making it impossible to plug in the cord to power up the fan. This is something that can be fixed by opening the unit (just take out all the screws on the bottom) and pushing the connector back in place. I've tried hot-gluing the connector back in place and using electric tape, but the connector pops back inside the unit every now and then, making it a bit of a pain.As others have mentioned, the fan can be really noisy. The noise usually dies down some if I hit it. Weird, but it works.Despite the flaws mentioned above, the single fan in the middle of the concave unit does a really good job keeping my laptop cool. Without the laptop cooling pad, it's almost unbearable to have the laptop on my lap and my laptop would lock up too. So for what it's worth, the pad works."
1,Fan seem to be made cheaply,"This fan lasted me for about 2 months before it broke. The fan did make some noise but it didn't feel like it was to loud, but it was loud enough to notice it. It feel like it was made very cheap like if it could break any moment which it did. The ""legs"" that give it that incline broke and when you use the fan without them, the blades were making really loud noises because without the legs, my laptop was putting to much weight into the fan which made the plastic casing sort of squeeze the blades. Although it did break quite fast, it managed to do its job while it lasted."
4,Better Than I Thought,"I don't normally write reviews for products on here but after reading all the negative reviews and taking a chance on this cooling pad, I have to say that I've been really impressed so far. The fan doesn't make any noise at all unless you have your ear right up to it. I have a 15"" Macbook Pro and it fits pretty well on it. I keep the back edge hanging off a little bit because that's where the hot air spews out of the laptop. I only use it on my bed and if the laptop is sitting on a flat surface then you don't need it. Overall I would recommend this product to anyone else. The only thing that remains to be seen is the long term durability."
2,"Flimsy materials, this was made to break.","I don't think the fan blades could be made any flimsier, which is why a few of them broke after 2 months, causing the product to make an obnoxious noise every time I used it because the fragments of the broken blades kept hitting the cage it's encased in. Shortly after, the flap that raises the back of the pad higher broke off too. If they used a tiny bit more plastic to make the blades thicker, or the back foot more durable, this cooling pad would have lasted longer. But I'm thinking that's what Belkin's plan was, considering that the cost of adding more plastic to the mold would have been pretty inexpensive. This cooling pad had a great design and cooled my laptop beautifully when it worked, but it seems to be purposefully made to break so that we'd have to go out and buy a new one in 2 months. The planned obsolescence of products such as this is greedy and downright unethical. Shame on you Belkin!"
2,Good at first but then it died,It was working the first 2 weeks I had it. Then I plugged it up and it wouldnt start anymore. No matter what i did it wouldnt work. Sometimes I plus it in itll work for about an hour. Then itll be dead the rest of the time. I wouldnt recommend it for people who use laptops daily
2,Makes a lot of noise. Flimsy stand.,negatives: broke after 5 months. plastic fan scrapped against internals making irritating noise.positives: nice tilt and raise. nicely holds computer on stand.
4,Great product,"I've had this for over a year being used pretty regularly and it cools my XPS M130 amazingly well. This laptop can get very hot and this cooler does an amazing job of keeping it very cool. I also like that it is comfortable to use on my desk or on my lap.The only complaints I have:USB cable is a bit too shortWhen on my desk the back stand doesn't lock that well so moving the laptop causes it to close and fall a littleIt is a bit noisy, but I got it for around $12 so I wasn't expecting ultra quiet at that price point.Overall a good product that has worked great for me."
1,Terrible product,"Had purchased 2 of these cooling pads, each one only lasted a few months. At first the fan began to only work if it was held in a very specific position (ie- if you angled it at all it would stop turning and functioning). It would also make a lot of noise, then stop working at all. The support foot is also pretty weak for having to hold the weight of a laptop and still allow the user some maneuverability. Both of my cooling pads had the foot snap off under only light use (moving the computer and pad from one location to another). It is a very cheaply-made product that does not last, and I would not recommend it at all."
2,Small and uncomfortable,It's good with cooling. But the front support should be as secure. It closes very easily. The laptops still glides with rubber pads. For laptop from 10 to 11 inches works well. What is most annoying is the arm that closes continuously. Works well on a hard surface like a desk.
3,Like it but....,"Wish the stand had a locking mechanism. Anytime you ""scoot"" the stand forward, the kickstand will then collapse and you are almost having to ""catch"" everything before the drop."
1,bad choice,"This is one of the times where you get what you pay for. The blades in the fan are falling off and out of the fan. And now it is roaring over the music I am trying to listen to. If your laptop is worth anything to you, spend a fee more bucks and get a different brand."
1,Worked okay for a while...then it broke down.,"I actually liked this for a while and then about 3 months in, it stopped working, completely! Oh well, I learned my lesson but thank goodness I didn't spend too much for it."
1,crap- laptop lap cooler and holder,"This product is very noisy. Can't use it most of the time, distracting, plus the stand brace under the platform keeps falling down. I have it loced up with rubber bands! My wife has one of these for her laptop and it works great, same product, that's why I bought it. This product is crap."
1,Power Connector Port Disappears!,After about 4-5 months of everyday use the power connector port popped out of place. Very cheap construction on belkin's part. This was not due to any misuse what so ever. It is not even worth it to pay for shipping to replace it. The fan can also be very loud at random times or when first starting up. As other people said you need to use the pull out prop when on a flat surface otherwise this will rock back and forth when typing or pressing on the keyboard.Overall very cheap build quality. I've owned several laptop coolers and this one is plastic junk. Might be worth it to spend the extra money and get an aluminum one if you use your laptop a lot. I recommend the Cooler Master Notepal U2/3.
2,Great until it broke,"this was a great way to cool off my laptop, but after about 3 months of use the back legs broke , once they broke it was completely useless, the fan still works and everything, but i can't use it because it can't stand up anymore. the legs are made of thin plastic that connect at 2 points to the back of the cooler, they need to be much thicker or connect at more points. so its back to fan shopping for me."
2,cheaply made,"This is extremely easy to use- but it seems extremely flimsy. The plastic feels cheap, the fan is noisy, and the design of the product is poor in my opinion in that the ""stand"" at the bottom does not lock into place - so that if i scoot it away from me - it collapses. Additionally - my laptop slides off the top quite easily. Very poor design. I cannot stand this product - though it does keep my laptop cooler."
1,Worked great for 2 months...,"Not worth the [...]; a completely disposable ""investment"". It worked great for 2 months, then started making a grinding noise and only worked intermittently. Then the DC-in plug pushed into the unit, so I can't use it at all anymore. 3 months of use - not worth it at all. Will be complaining to Belkin, which generally makes good products."
2,The stand legs broke two timw,"I have this stand for 8 months, I only used to work on a table and over my bed when working at night, the fan is very efficient and quiet but the supporting legs are weak and they broke by the fourth month I used it, I could stick them together with crazy glue and work well until today, the problem seems to be that the legs are too thin and this makes a weak zone that tends to break after a long time you take it to one place to another."
2,Worked well....... until it stopped.,"I bought this less than five months ago. It worked really well for about 3 months. The legs eventually broke off, leaving me to prop it up using whatever book or coaster that was available to keep the airflow moving. Shortly after that the fan became very noisy and only worked for a few minutes, stopped, and then became noisy again. Finally, the fan just quit working all together. The fan itself, when it worked, was great. My notebook overheats very easy and this did the trick in keeping it very cool. Overall, I would not buy this product again due to the poor design and structure of the legs and fan. Maybe I just got a lemon?"
3,It's noisy.,"It works but it's noisy. That's really all you need to know. I have two bought at different times (so not from the same batch) and they both make the same clatter when you start them up that sounds the same as a computer fan does just before it dies. Once running it actually quietens down enough to be acceptable. And I've brought two laptops back from the dead by using these - both had severe heating problems, but with a combination of blowing the dust out of the laptop fan vents and adding a cooling pad, both run just fine 24hrs a day.This is not a product I'ld want to use for long on my lap however."
1,Rubbish,"This chill mat is absolute rubbish. The plastic fan guard is what the laptop weight focuses on unless you have the cheap plastic stand flicked down. The guard will quickly deform to interfere with fan operation, leading to heating of the fan motor , heating the air which is subsequently blown in to the laptop. Who puts the fan inlet on the bottom of something designed to sit on your lap or a flat surface, just dumb. You cannot use your laptop on your lap with this piece of junk. The ergonomics are awkward. It is just junk, but luckily you won't have it around long as it wears out after a month or two. The Antec is better"
2,"Design is good but Fan chipped off, noisy","Perhaps I got a defective product? Initially I was happy with it. Then the outer plastic covering kept touching the fan - eventually a part of the fan chipped off. It still worked though. One downside with the design is that the fan is at the bottom which is ineffective in drawing air when you are working on your lap. I also thought it was noisy. I bought it because I thought it was well designed - light, comfortable curvature - which does make a difference but unfortunately the product was defective I guess. If I don't find another cooler that draws air in from the sides, I might give this a try again."
1,Plastic Fan Blade breaks off after a month of use,"I bought the Belkin and after a month, the one of the plastic fan blades broke off and created a terrible noise.At first I liked the cooler but would not recommend this product to anyone else. Keep your receipt as you will besending it back for repairs."
1,"Great for a day, broken already!","I bought my Belkin Cooling pad at a big box store, similar price to online here. It had a better design then the other cooling pad in stock, same price so I bought the Belkin. The 1st day I used it, it was wonderful, and effectively cooled my laptop. After using it lightly for the 1st day, the fan started hitting the case or something, because it makes a horrible grinding noise when turned on. I can still kind of use it very carefully if I don't move or bump it at all, but sometimes it still makes that noise anyway, no matter how I position it, and even if I get it in a spot it works in, eventually it starts making that nasty noise again! As soon as I get paid this cooling pad will be in a trashcan, and I'm buying a better model. It looks like Belkin has a newer model that looks like it might have improved on the design flaws of this one, I'd buy it if you have to have a Belkin."
2,Do NOT waste your money,This product will work great for a few months then break down on you. It came free with my brothers Sony Vaio computer but he didn't use it. I started using it daily while watching movies and running heavy programs because I didn't want my laptop over heating. I worked really well for up until recently now it makes this loud annoying sound and it does not cool off as well as it used. To had to that one of the fan blades fell off randomly.I usually like Belkin products but you should pass on this.I'm currently looking for a replacement with two fans.
4,Gets the job done.,"I just received this cooling pad, Before I got it my laptop was overheating and shutting down within 20 minutes of resource intensive use. This has stopped now. Although I will no it overheated once after 3+ hours of resource intensive use. But that is reasonable because of the limits of my computer. It is actually fairly awkward to use this actually on your lap, But you can position it fairly well and still give air flow to that fan if you fidget with it for awhile. Just not the best thing since the back stand digs into your knees a bit. The fan Is very silent and less loud then the actual laptop fan. Just a steady light hum.Overall it fixed my overheating issues on my laptop, Even if the use of it sitting down is somewhat awkward it is still a product that can get the job done for me."
1,Horrible product,"Do not buy this product! Within a week, two of the fan blades broke and it started making unbearable noise. I still used it because I was desperate. It's been 2 months now and there's only 6 blades left! It's basically made with really cheap, flimsy material that won't last for more than a couple of months. I'm throwing it in the trash now!"
4,Pretty good cooler.,"If you want a cooling pad that does the trick, this is it. It sits nicely under your laptop, and the rubber portions keep your laptop from moving around.What you need to know:-This product will make your legs cold. If you chill easily, don't use this product on your lap.-It plugs into your computer. This zaps power from you computer, so just know you might have to charge your computer while using this.-I find the support on the bottom sometimes collapses when putting the computer on it. This is for table-top use. So be warned that it might go flying if you try to slide it on there."
2,Worked well.. but not for long.,"I've had this laptop cooler for about half a year, and a couple months ago it started stopping abruptly, as if the fan got caught in something, and I would have to manually get it spinning again (by sticking a pencil or something). Then after a few weeks, that method didn't work anymore, so I tried restarting my laptop every time the fan stopped. That worked for a couple of times, and then it just died altogether. It was pretty cheap when I bought it.. a little under $20. It worked well for the first few months, so I guess it was an ok product for that price. I wouldn't suggest investing it this though."
1,Worked great... for 2 months!,"I got this for my new Dell laptop. Despite the fact that this isn't really wide enough, it worked perfectly to keep both the computer and my lap cool. Then last week it just died on me! Now I can't even return it for a full refund. Find a better product elsewhere or you'll end up having to replace this every other month."
1,Broken Cooling Pad,"I bought this item about a month ago and it is already broken. At first it seemed great because it was very simple to use, however all of a sudden it just broke! I am very unhappy with this product."
4,Great product,I have had this cooling device for a bit over a year and it works very well on my Dell Studio Laptop. It only negative is that it is a bit noisy. Very minor issue.
2,"Unstable, barely reaches our USB port","We are in the market for a new cooling pad. The fan quit working on this one; we have had it probably 2 years. It barely reaches our USB port on our Inspiron 17. The 'legs' don't stay up when you have to pick up the computer, but the computer shuts down without the cooling fan. When you reach under to 'open' the legs again, sometimes your fingers meet up with the fan -ouch. So you have to lift it high enough to look. Needless to say, it is awkward and we are looking for another brand. Also, if you don't have at least one of the legs opened, it rocks, so annoying."
2,Not what I expected,"I will begin with saying you can get this cooling pad for about $14 at Target or $16 at Wal-Mart. I ordered it because of the convenience. It is not the high end model but the cheaper one they offer. The cooling pad is very small and I have a small mac which was too big for this little cooler. The fan sucks air from the bottom of the pad so if you plan on using it on your lap or even on a pillow forget it, it will totally block the fan. The little stand does not stay. Overall for the price its functional but for a little bit more money its best to get the better model."
3,"Good design, best if used with CushTop stand","This cooler has a good design, but I found it works best when used in combination with the CushTop stand - this does 2 things: (1) protects the cooling fan and (2) elevates the laptop to a more eye and neck-friendly level. It allows you to keep the flip-out part of the FSL001 cooler engaged since the weight of the laptop keeps it pressed into the top of the CushTop stand. Using it alone is dangerous since the fan is plastic and seems like it can break easily or catch some flesh/clothing. I've had 2 Antec coolers but found this design to be the best. The laptops really seem to like the concave form and using the CushTop as a stable base keeps the fan running smooth and happy.I wouldn't mind paying an extra $10 or so for a ball-bearing fan like the Antecs, but all in all this seems to do a good job of cooling."
2,I would NOT recommend this product.,"I did not have a good experience with this laptop cooling pad. Though it looks convenient in theory (it's lightweight and the cord that plugs into the USB port is about the right length), mine just...doesn't work well.The fan stopped working completely after about a week. Not good, right? The only good thing I can say about it is that its concave design allows SOME air to flow under the laptop, which does help a bit when it comes to overheating (only minimally, though--my computer still overheats regularly). You can achieve the same effect by propping the computer up on something.The rubber grips that are supposed to hold the computer in place aren't ""sticky"" enough; the computer shifts around a lot if not set on a completely solid and stationary surface (making it impractical to use on your knees or while sitting on a bed).All in all, I was very disappointed in this product. I would not buy one again."
3,Not as good as I thought,"I did some research on different cooling pads and came down to Belkin F5L001. At first it work really well, but the design was the best for my laptop (Dell studio XPS 13"") But after using the pad for about a month, the fan started to make a loud humming sound. The sound goes away in about 10-15 min of usage ,but it is very annoying."
