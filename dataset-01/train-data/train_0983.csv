2,Drying,"Unlike the other reviewers, I found it to be very drying after using 2 large bars. My lips became chapped and dry. My whole family had been using it for 4 weeks when even my preschooler and husband started to complain how itchy they were. My skin is oily and it did remove all of the oil and then some! When I stopped using the bar, my lips went back to normal and we all stopped itching. We're not particularly sensitive or allergic to anything. I really wanted to like this soap, especially since it received great ratings on the cosmetic database for purity. Initially, we loved everything about it. Over time, dryness became a huge issue. I did give it 2 stars anyway because it does last a long time, the ingredients are pure, and the smell is pleasant."
1,stinks like tar,"I was hoping for a mild soap with a faint olive oil scent. Instead, when I lathered it up, it smelled like tar. I kid you not, it stinks. I don't know if it was rancid olive oil or what, but after trying it a couple times (the soap's not cheap, and I was hoping to be able to tolerate the smell) I had to give up and throw the bar away, it smelled too bad for me."
1,case studies without the strategy,"This really isnt very helpful. Just sloppy steps, theory free, derived from some fast dated case studies, revealing nothing."
4,The more things change...,"Before there was Enron, Bernie Madoff, or AIG, there was ""Equity Funding."" The year 1973 saw the world's first Billion Dollar fraud. It was not to be the last. This was a classic Ponzi Scheme using the new fangled icon of believability: Mainframe computers.Also a movie ""Billion Dollar Bubble"" starring James Woods in the role of the actuary.The fraud was either $200 Million or $2.0 Billion, depending on whom you read. I recall the larger number. That's US$8.496 Billion in today's dollars."
4,Great for the disabled,"I've had mine for 5 months and there is not one speck of mildew on my shower curtain (this had been an ongoing problem). While it's not perfect, it's darn good and I can easily clean my shower without asking for help."
1,Not good,Installed unit and it worked for several weeks and them stopped working. Unable to get it working again. Used plastic spray bottle for rest of fluid
1,Complete and total junk,"I purchased local. Used all of the first bottle of cleaner and needed to replace. Broke the ""tip"" removing the empty bottle. I removed exactly as the instructions described. Returned the unit for a (free) exchange. Finished first bottle on the new unit, emptied, removed, BROKE the tip again! Returned for refund (store credit). Junk."
2,Unit did not last through one set of batteries Causes mildew?,I have doubted the efficacy of this product but have kept using it until the unit died before having to change batteries. I have to say that I often wondered if the mildew did not get worse after I started using this product. Another peculiar happening was that it caused calcium to extrude from spots on my grout. I thought perhaps they were locations where the sealer was thin and there was an interaction. I'm not sure but it started after I started using the Scrubbing Bubbles product.It is a great fantasy to have something cleaning my shower but I found I had to hand scrub it harder occasionally to keep the lime & mildew at bay. Isn't that what this was supposed to do. It's amazing how long wishful thinking and denial can keep one going.Doh!
1,Scrubbing Bubbles Fizzles,"I see why they tell you to close the shower door, so you don't see how poorly this thing operates. The back half of my shower doesn't get sprayed at all. Maybe I got a lemon, because this thing is a very disappointing waste of money. I gave it one star because 0 stars was not an option."
4,It is GOOD,"I bought this,,,followed the directions by starting with a super clean shower. I have used it for 2 months and it does great. I do have to do the glass shower doors once a week (lightly). I recommend it."
3,"does it job, and nothing else","I got this a few months back to help with cleaning the shower, to my surprise, it actually did work, a little. This is better at maintaining a clean shower than it is a getting one clean."
2,"Great Concept, But Not Up To The Task","I used this for two months with my conventional tub/shower curtain. The power sprayer is effective, but only where it can make contact--from the tub floor to 4 ft. high. The 3 ft. above that mark goes untouched, and is in need of manual cleaning.I bought ten refills, at TARGET for $3.49 each (non-sale price), and when they run out, I will sell this waste of money at a Garage Sale. I can clean ALL AREAS by manually spraying TILEX, and at half the price!"
2,Works well but very expensive refills,"This product works as well as the spray bottles and it is so much easier remembering to use it. I actually feel like I forgot something everytime I go to the bathroom and forget to push the button and close the shower doors.The bad part: The refills are expensive. Compared to same sized bottles of Tilex or Shower Fresh, they are about 50% to 75% more expensive. They are actually more expensive than any other bottles at the cleaning isle of the two supermarkets I go to! I would not have purchased it if I knew they were going to get me so bad with the overpriced refills."
1,Not worth the money,The product worked ok directly behind where the cleaner was mounted but didn't reach accross the shower or do anything for the lower portion of the shower. Not worth the investment.
1,Just do it yourself,"Unlike some products that assist in maintaining a clean home (like Roomba), this product is a waste of money. It really doesn't keep the shower walls any cleaner between manual scrubbing, and it died before 3 months went by. Since you will end up having to clean the shower yourself anyway, just skip this product altogether."
1,Does not perform as advertised.,This product left my clean shower with horrible water/cleaner streaks on the glass. I have requested a refund from the manufacturer (threw away the box). Will update when I hear from them.
1,Don't waste your money,"After 10 days, I was supposed to see a difference in the shower. Instead, the mildew seemed to thrive on the cleaner. I have gone back to the manual method. It only sprays a band around the shower - doesn't even reach near the bottom. How is that supposed to get it clean?"
1,Don't waste your money!,I had the opportunity to try this product for free. I was excited to try this since I had been eyeing it at the store. I don't know if I was sent a defective unit or if this is the standard for the product but it wouldn't work when it was initially set up. Took the batteries in and out several times and finally got it to work. Sadly it only worked 5 times before breaking again. The only way to get it to work is to take the batteries out and put them in again and it will then run ONCE. Too much of a pain after each shower. I also question how well it actually cleans but sadly I barely got to try it! So glad I didn't buy it at the store! Don't waste your money!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,I bought this over 2 months ago and it b=never made my shower look any cleaner. I finally threw it away and went back to Tilex Mold and Mildew Cleaner. now my shower is clean.
3,Wish it worked a bit better,"Seems to keep already cleaned areas cleaner, but didn't do anything after 15 cycles on a soiled area (part of a ring around the tub) that I left for comparison. Thoroughly clean area first, and then it should reduce, but not eliminate the need to clean."
3,"Works, but not very well","I bought one of these about six weeks ago and have been using it daily since. I started out with a dirty shower stall with some soap scum and mildew. It has done very well against the soap scum on the wall with the shower head -- especially the area directly behind the spray nozzle of the unit itself. It seems ineffective against the mildew on the folding shower door, though. I was hoping to use it to get away from having to use harsh cleaners such as bleach, but it is looking like I will have to give the shower a real cleaning. I did buy a refill bottle at Wal-Mart and they seemed a little pricey."
1,Piece of Junk,"Please save your money and do not buy this.Like others, I also fell for the advertising hype and went out and bought this thing. I have a newborn, a toddler and a new puppy at home, which doesn't exactly leave me a lot of time to clean. So needless to say I had high hopes for this product.Well, to start with my shower was not exactly sparkling clean but not very dirty either...this product did NOT clean the shower and certainly did not prevent it from getting dirtier. It does not clean the wall on which it hangs, it does not reach above face level, and it does not even reach the far wall of my shower, making it pretty much useless. The refills are ridiculously expensive and the cleaner has a strong, offensive odor when combined with the steam from the shower. I can't even finish getting dressed in the bathroom without opening the door to get a breath of fresh air.Anyhow, I would rate it zero stars if that rating existed....guess it's back to cleaning the old-fashioned way."
3,"Not a ""magic wand"", but pretty good","It's advertised as something that will free you from ever having to clean your shower again. It's not true, of course, as others have already pointed out. You will still need to put in a little ""elbow grease"" of your own to touch it up. Also, the bottle sometimes doesn't mount properly, in which case you'll need to remove the bottle from the sprayer and widen the hole with a letter opener or the like. Otherwise, the shower cleaner spins around without spraying anything (you can tell by the higher-pitched noise it makes). However, when working properly (which it usually does), the automatic shower cleaner does clean up the shower quite a bit, enough for me to give it a three-star review and recommend it."
1,WISH COMET BATHROOM CLEANER MADE ONE,"Not a great cleaning, just kind of adequate. Still need to scrub regularly which I thought that this gadget would help me to avoid, especially costing as much as it and it's refills do. Wait for the price to fall a lot lower or forget about it altogether."
2,Overly Gushy,"I was really looking for some form of conflict, resolutions, strong characters with alternate voices when I read this novel. All I got out of it was a constant 'gush' presentation between two men who, we cannot help but like. Liking them just doesn't make this a great or even good novel. It's very redundent listening to chapter after chapter when the author uses 'babe and endearments' over and over again. Everyone accepts these two men too easily and 'giggling' ends any hopeful topic worthy of follow-up. A handyman falls in love with a postman and everything is picket white fences. This all happens far too quickly leaving nothing to the imagination. I found myself getting quite tired of the lead characters after 50 pages."
3,"Loved the characters, not the dialog",I really wanted to love this book but it was a bit too schmaltzy for me. I think it's wonderful that the two main characters love each other so much but to always have to say it after each chapter almost makes me feel they are so insecure they don't really believe it. I also wished it would have taken them longer to find each other and fall in love. It was all with in the first 50 pages and from their it felt as if I'd all ready gotten to the climax of the story. No pun intended. I did like the struggles they went through once they were together such as meeting the relatives and moving together. It just needed a bit more surprises and conflicts.
3,Easy read but not great literature,"It was enjoyable to read, but also rather simplistic in plot and certainly not a ""must-read"" book. This might be the sort of book you get in Kindle format (cheaper) because you're not going to want it for posterity."
1,From Navy Blue To Corp. Grey : A Career Transition Guide for,"When looking at the title of this book I was disappointed to see that it appears to be directed towards American Ex-military only.As I am an Ex-Royal Australian Naval Person, I am not sure that it applies to Aussie ex-servicemen and women. This I would be interested to understand why? I'm sure it took considerable time and effort for the author to compile, organise, categorate data - then to write this book. I only wish that it applied to myself but to other Ex-Australian service personnel."
2,Not what I expected,Turned out to be the wrong kind of cable with only 40 wires instead of 80......I didn't return it because it was inexpensive.
2,"Beware: This is a 40-pin, NOT 80-pin, IDE cable",I'm giving this 2 stars only because the product description did not explicitly indicate that this cable is a 40-pin which is older and not as preferable as an 80-pin one.
3,Where is the Love?,"i regret not being able to give this book 5 stars because what it contains is amazing information. the 4 star rating is because of whats missing. the main thing being the sex lives, romance and love between the people of ancient Rome. there is absoutely nothing except for a sentence or two about bacchanal orgies. i'm not looking for Jacquline Susann but what is more important than these three things. it's a stunning omission and i am completely perplexed why it isn't in there. also there is very little about day to day things such as clothes, toiletries, grooming and interpersonal relations. its chock full of geography and battle info.... which is great but i was hoping for more ""everyday life"" stuff.... like what happens in a family, what kind of schools and differences in schooling for the rich and poor.well actually i'm going down to a 3 after writing this."
3,Didn't work for me.,I went by the directions and had no luck at all with this product. I wouldn't buy it again for that reason.
4,Excellent live performance!,"Although an expert will know they are from America and not Andalucia, you will not be disappointed by this live recording! Recommended for guitar music lovers of any genre."
4,Not the best live album,"I bought this to play at a party I was hosting, just a bit of fun between the usual music. I have seen these two live and this is what they are best at. This CD has a lot of the hits/favourites. The quality is not up to studio stuff, but it is good enough for a party."
2,Too few,"The ad made it sound like there would be MANY balls, not six. The balls look fine, but they were not a real deal. I am happy, except for content."
5,Great story,I was pretty skeptical about the ghost part at first but as I got to reading I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down. The story line is very fun too. I'd recommend this one!
4,Not really a biography,"I have a few of these, which were printed in the late 30s. The book (fairly slim) includes quite a few songs (as sheet music) that to my knowledge (and I'm something of a Kyser authority)Kyser never recorded. There are plenty of cute pics w/ cute captions, and several bandmembers are identified, which is nice, since except for the featured vocalists, which Kyser always acknowledged, there's not a lot of info out there regarding the players.Amazon also offers the only discography on Kyser, to which i contributed. It was published by Joyce. This book is worth having if you're a KK collector, but not a lot of real info. More a fluffy, humorous overview."
1,I was disappointed,"I am a fan of Grover, and an aspiring musician myself. If you are a musician, this video will be very dissappointing. There are hardly any solos by other instruments, Grover plays the whole time on almost every song. I don't know why the band is even there, there may as well be a tape playing in the background. I've heard Grover do much better than this, and I am disappointed. The whole thing sounds empty, the visual effects are average. Just an overall disappointment. I would recommend ""Live at the Bijou"" as a good Grover album. On this video, though it seemed like they just wanted to slap something together so they could sell a video of Grover. Maybe at this point in his life he was just catering to the audience, and was tired of playing the same songs over and over."
3,Any musicians out there?,"As a professional musician, the first thing I want to know about a music performance dvd is ""who is in the band""? Often it is so hard to find a review listing the personnel. Please people, next time you do a music review - tell us who is playing each instrument. It is very important to us, especially in the jazz genre.Not one of the eight reviews here could give me that info, which in turn, prevents me from considering purchasing the dvd, and to me, that is what a review is for."
4,A Good Narrative,"Shades of Glory is a very good narrative history of Black Baseball. It includes pre-segregation players such as Moses Fleetwood Walker, the Heyday of the Negro leagues and the teams that continued to play after the color barrier was broken. The book is thorough and I think will help people understand baseball's place in Black society of the time. I found only one weakness - For the real sports statistician, the book is disappointing for its only brief section on players stats."
1,slings the crickets,"I have a gecko who can't seem to catch crickets but can't see them if they aren't moving. Thought this would help to use freeze dried crickets, but it vibrates so furiously that it slings them across the aquarium"
3,not what I had in mind,"This wasn't bad, it just wasn't what I expected. It had more onion than pea flavor."
2,Horrible,"This is the worst split pea soup I have ever tasted. There are way too many onions... I usually like a lot of onions in soup, but this was ridiculous. There were more onions than peas! It tasted more like I was eating onion soup with ""split pea"" flavor. On top of that, the onions did not even taste fresh, they were bitter. Amy's usually makes great products, but they desperately need to change this soup. I give it 2 stars only because it is healthy, and there might be a small chance of someone liking this if they like tons of onions.Walnut Acres' Split Pea soup used to be perfect, but they changed their recipe recently after I reviewed it. It is still ok and still tastes better than Amy's Split Pea.Walnut Acres Organic Soups, Split Pea, Fat Free, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)"
3,Mediocre,"I agree with the previous review, whereas the onion overpowers the taste of peas. The soup itself isn't quite thick, and I found myself adding a multitude of saltines and some additional cracked pepper to thicken it up. Honey ham really helped add that extra something, but not everyone has that option as this is a vegan soup."
5,Excellent Release of Two-Disc Versions,"These are the two-disc versions of both Predator and Predator 2 (4 discs total) in slim cases with the cover shown on Amazon. The best of both worlds, and a small package for more valuable shelf space."
1,Obsolete,Can someone please explain to me what the point of this box is now that a trilogy box is probably only months away?
3,Brain Tumor...,"Steve March (John Agar) is a nuclear physicist who is entered and possessed by an alien entity. The alien is a giant, floating brain with glowing peepers. It's name is Gor and it has come to conquer the earth. Enter Vol, the ""good guy"" alien, another floating brain sent to stop Gor's evil plot. Vol enters Steve's dog so he can keep an eye on him. Meanwhile, Gor is causing mid-air explosions on jets and gathering all the nations' heads of state (which apparently amounts to about six countries) to explain his plan for world domination. Can Vol stop him before the flea and tick season? Let us watch and pray for humanity..."
4,"no budget , just right","gloriously seat-of-ones-pants filmaking with infinitesimal funding and grand aginst type turn . AGAR and the FX crew have a field day with their respective gifts and provide ample laughter , charm and thrills . accept no substitutes . bask in the festivities and emerge smiling broadly ."
3,FUN NO HOLDS BARRED SCIFI MOVIE,"ONCE AGAIN IN THIS SCIFI THRILLER MAN IS GIVING THE ULTIMATE POWER TO DESTROY THE EARTH. A GOOD IMAGINATIVE STORY WITH TENSE MOMENTS. SPECIAL EFFECTS GOOD, CONSIDERING THIS MOVIE WAS PRODUCED IN 1958. JOHN AGAR PUT ON A GOOD PERFOMANCE AS THE MAN POSSESSED BY AN EVIL INTELLIGENCE. TRULY A NO HOLDS BARRED MOVIE. FUN MOVIE TO WATCH."
1,The case for this DVD is environmentally damaging.,"This review is for the entire shopping experience and the physical item shipped by Amazon. If you are after a ""pure"" movie review I recommend you also see the The Internet Movie Database.The DVD case is full of holes, is lightweight and flimsy. This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill.Light can also pass through the DVD case, which may shortening the life of the DVD.If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.Good movie, fun to watch. This movie features an evil brain and a good brain.Some fairly well-known actors with a decent story."
3,Alien Brain wants our women!,"Any good 50's Sci Fi fan knows there is the good, the bad, and the so bad it is good. I'll put The Brain from Planet Arous in the latter category. Just barely. Evil alien brain crashes in the desert, takes over a scientist only to find out he REALLY likes earth women. Meanwhile good alien brain comes after him and decides to take up residence in a dog so he can observe evil brain and figure out how to stop him. I'm not making this up. Evil brain threatens the world and makes lots of wide eyed crazy looking faces as planes are destroyed just by looking at them. The acting is bad throughout with the exception of Joyce Meadows who has to fight off the leacherous advances of the evil brain. Maybe she wasn't acting? Picture quality is fine. Fun one time but not sure when it will make it back into my rotation."
3,ok I guess,"Well, it wasn't as advertised which is probably exactly why it's so cheap. However it is a unique cover featuring the movies official or second poster. But the back seems as if the storyline was just typed up before sent. I guess I just expected something else. Oh and the menus are boring with no special features on any of the three dvd's I ordered, so probably none on any other of his movies. But the movie plays and I guess thats all you can ask for. Thanks, I guess."
5,Sound Advise for You and Your Team,"Andrew DuBrin gives you the tools to advance your career by increasing your visibility as a team player.But he doesn't stop there. He provides sound advise for members and leaders to make your teams more productive.Well written, and well organized. I consider the book essential reading for all managers."
1,no cigar,I've been putting this on occasionally for my 3 year old for several months but he is still just not interested. It's quite simple so it might be good for those much younger but for any child that has been exposed to colorful cartoons (even simple PBS shows likle my son) this will be boriing to look at. It's so low budget I can't even stand to watch it myself. And where are the articles? They may not be necessary in English but they certainly are in any language that includes them.
5,Great way to instill different languages,"I don't own the actual DVD but I will soon. We get a 9 minute video of this on our freezone and my 7 month old absolutely loves it! We bought your baby can read and we can't even get past the first word without loosing his attention, but he will sit and watch this whole video without a peep. My son will already be bilingual as I am, and my side of the family speaks english and my husbands side is completely spanish. To me it is important for our son to speak many languages, and what better time to start than now while his brain is a sponge."
1,The worst purchasing experience I ever have,"I ordered this DVD ""Bilingual Baby: Teach Baby German"". However, the company DIRECT USA sent me the wrong thing ""Bilingual Baby: Teach Baby English"". I don't need the DVD to teach my kids English. I contacted the company about this issue through Amazon but never got any response. I wasted $12 dollars. This is the worst online purchasing experience I ever have. Please never buy things from DIRECT USA."
5,They work as advertised,They work as advertised. Professionally made and work as they should. Small and lightweight but tend to tangle. I'd buy them again.
2,Not professional quality,"These are not the high-quality professional clips you are looking for. These leads are made of a cheap-feeling plastic, and are molded to a very low tolerance. They just don't have the crisp, precise movement of the good leads, and that makes them hard to work with. They might be fine for a student or a hobbyist on a budget, but professionals should stay away."
1,Misrepresented and Cheaply Made!,"I bought this item from RTE Scientific seller. When I received this item, I immediately noticed that this is not the same item as pictured. I've used the same minigrabber before so I was expecting to get what was in the picture. I was expecting the product to be the same quality as what I've used before. To my disappointment, the item I received was not even the same as shown in the picture. It is cheaply made and I even wonder if this is even the real Elenco Minigrabber that I ordered. When I contacted the seller, I received I reply asking, ""DID IT NOT WORK?"" So I guess it doesn't matter whether you're getting what was represented as long as it does the same job. It's not really worth saving some money buying form untrusted seller. Next time, I'm buying something and it's available thru Amazon, I'd get it from them and pay the extra. Lesson learned!"
2,Poor Quality,"The jumpers don't extend far enough to hook around component leads. The hook metal is very cheap quality, it bends and deforms easily making it difficult to get a good mechanical connection to the component lead."
2,Outdated,"I was looking for a good guidebook for Panama. It is a great guidebook, but is the 7th edition, written in 2001. Most of the information in it is way outdated, and the book is useless to me. Had I known it was an older edition, I would not have bought it."
4,Fun to watch..,This making a scene video was fun to watch. I watched it to get fight scene ideas for my self defense videos. There was not too many fight scenes though. Coach David Alexander (.com)
4,great dvd so much missing,"I saw Billy Idol on this tour live at the Turning Stone Casino in Oneida, NY. Though I recommend this DVD for all Idol/Stevens fans, I was disappointed that a large part of the show I saw was missing. Even reviewers of this Chicago show mention this fact. I was really looking forward to performances of 'Evil Eye' and 'Rat Race' and also the amazing duel guitar solo battle between Steve Stevens and the drummer (who left his drum kit and picked up a guitar.) I have no idea if this was on the SoundStage special. I am hoping that there is an expanded version of this concert in the works, 70 minutes is definitely way too short. Might as well call it an excerpt. All this aside, it is still a rocking DVD."
2,super overdrive,"song selection inadequate, short, no oncore, waste of money, Why bother putting out something totally inferior to what I have listened to in the past."
1,I threw it in the trash,"That's right, threw it in the trash. I can make a better video on my cell phone. What a rip off piece of s#*t"
5,A 5 Star rating for Idol and his Crew,Idol and the band rocked from start to finish not a single performance was a disappointment. The only way this could have been better for me is if I had actually gotten a chance to see this live in Chicago. Closing out the concert with Generation X's Kiss Me Deadly was a perfect choice. Idol and his crew have mad talent and loads of energy never standing stock still for more than two seconds. I really have to say that who ever put this DVD together did an amazing job I almost felt like I was really there. My only complaint is the back of the DVD Idol is shown rocking out on a guitar which isn't shown in the footage but I more than got over that.
3,hey mike ...,hey mike - do you even know billy idol's song catalog ? G Peck is correct; there are several great hits missing from this performance dvd. perhaps they were left off on purpose and will be included later in an expanded more expensive version like they always do now with classics cd works of various artists.this is still very entertaining and billy has sure aged well over the last 20-25 years. i would wait and hope for a more expanded product before purchasing - and try to dvr or tivo the pbs version instead.beawheel
4,easy to read; comprehensive; a little difficult to follow,"Marcel Lavabre uses lay-person's language to explain and educate the reader about the basic and the chemical world of essental oils. I have a heightened appreciation for these chemicals as well as a greater understanding of how they work, and how to make use of them in my business. I do find it a little difficult to locate the specific application of an oil in the many tables that are offered, but the information seems to be fairly comprehensive."
1,Not even worthwhile for a kid's watch,"These Activa watches are garbage. Don't be suckered by ""Swiss Made"" or the photos of bespectacled watch engineers. (Any watch with a decent Swiss movement will be over $100.) I bought an Activa very similar to this one (a ""pink cow"" watch), which has stopped working within one year.If you don't want your kids to be disappointed, I would recommend some other brand. I'm sure Timex has some inexpensive kid's watches (e.g.,Timex Kids' Time Teacher Flowers Stretch Band Watch #T89022), and their unglamorous Chinese movements seem to work just fine for years and years. But if your kid is going to break the watch anyway within a few months, or can't tell time, or doesn't even care if the watch hands are moving, then I guess the Activa is fine as a sort of watch-like bracelet."
2,"Staind, not what I expected!","This Cd is not what I expected. It has some of the hits mixed in as acoustic and live cuts. Either give me a whole live album or an entire acoustic set as an entire CD. The hits are on this CD....but does not work as it is! Staind, you should be ashamed of yourselves for putting crap out there like this!"
5,Awesome,"Not much u can say other than Awesome! Download came through fast and easy, no prooblems with payment and I didn't have any trouble :)"
5,Worth every penney!,"I have never really been a big fan of Staind, however I have loved certain songs of theirs here and there, but I am an overall Alternative rock fan. So I came across this album and it had all the greats that I really liked plus a few I like from others in acoustic versions so I got it. Wow, this is one compilation that will be tough for Staind to ever overcome! I would say the absolute best album they have ever compiled! This rarely comes out of my CD player!JeremyJacksonville, FL"
5,One of my favrite cds of the year,I thought this cd was a very good one. If you're a fan of Staind then this is a must have.
1,Staind covered TOOL!,"This is a special message for Staind, not its fans. Dear Staind, I alwayse thought you were a average modern day band. Singing about sad stuff, and crying. But once I heard you covered TOOL, I threw my stereo across the room in rage. The fact that you took a very good Prog metal song and turned it into a slow, depressing song disgusts me. I think I speak for all the metal heads out there when I say Leave our Music alone. Just because you wish you could make music like that doenst mean you should cover it! If this message makes you teary eyed, go home and cry to your mommy then. If you cant play like the big boys then dont play at all!"
3,3 IS FOR ACOUSTIC BONUS,"3 IS FOR ACOUSTIC BONUS TRACKS. IF YOU GO TO BEST BUY YOU GET TWO EXTRA BONUS TRACKS. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I WASN'T GOING TO BUY THIS, BUT AFTER I SAW THE EXTRA BONUS MATERIAL I HAD TO. AFTERALL, ARRON LEWIS IS AT HIS BEST WHEN HE SINGS ON ACOUSTIC GUITAR. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN FIVE STARS BUT THE OMISSION OF FADE AND HOW ABOUT YOU IS RIDICULOUS."
2,!!!!! Warning not for die hart fans !!!!!,"I'm was a Staind fan from the beginning and first of all they left out so much of their great early stuff, instead they only put the radio songs that made them popular, and second off all, greatest hits albums should have 20 songs, and forget covering other bands, no one can cover a great song like the original. Here's my list of the greatest hits, and notice about 95% was left out of the album:1. Open your Eyes 2. Suffocate3. Come Again 4. It's Been Awhile5. Tolerate 6. Yesterday7. Just Go 8. Pressure9.

Fray20 So Far AwayAnd their you go, If you really want a good greatest album write your own and e-mail the list to them."
1,Maybe I'm not smoking enough...,"I don't know why I keep giving krush a chance, this album continues a long line of minimal (boring) releases from the japanese B-boy, and, if you have any of the others, you don't need this one. The best thing he's done is still ""meiso"" and thats only 'cause of the D.J. Shadow remix. Sorry but ""Ga"" is not up to very much at all."
5,Works Great!,"Theses gloves perform as advertised. I have a little schnoodle puppy who drags in everything, since she drags the ground herself, and the gloves cut way down on the cleanup in the house. Plus, she thinks it's great fun to be rubbed down with them. They were shipped right away. Very prompt service. Would buy again from this seller, and highly recommend this product."
1,Too thin.,Bought one of these because it was not much money but it turns out to be cheap copy of a much better product the Spotless Paw. Water soaks though the glove and my hand gets wet when using this glove.Spotless Paw Dog Paw Grooming Glove (One size)
3,Get a better editor,"The story's not bad if you can get past the mis-spelled words, dialogue of people who aren't even in the scenes, very little transitions and terrible use of pronouns. Richard needs to get a better editor."
4,Sound philosophical work,"I found Wiley's book during my doctoral research on Mead, some years ago. It is, beyond any doubt, a sound philosophical work by one of America's leading thinkers in this field. His knowledge of the history of philosophy is impressive, his analytical creativity is awesome, and his intellectual rigour is also noteworthy. So, if you are interested in the theories of the self and American philosophical pragmatism this book is certainly worth buying."
2,Not what I expected,"I was very disappointed when I opened the box. They are VERY stiff and are not adjustable whatsoever. I bought these to use a studio prop and havent had a chance to try them out yet, but I have a feeling they will not photograph as realistic-looking. I have a 22 month old and the straps are WAY too big for her, so if you are thinking of using these for a Halloween costume, you should probably take that into consideration. The wings i received were missing a lot of the little feathers on top, thus showing the cardboard."
2,Children's Angel Wings,Wings look a lot more realistic and beautiful in the pictures. Maybe my expectations were much higher. Was a bit disappointed when I opened the box. It seems so flat and did not look as pictured. For the price I guess its pretty decent. Depends on what you're looking for. For photo opts - its a great addition (will look good in pictures).
4,angel wings,Angel wings are made of real feathers! They are a little small so make sure your child is not older than 5 or 6.
4,Pretty durable feathers,I wish they were a tad bigger. They look a little small on my six year old. Very pretty though and good price.
2,beautifull but so rigid material,"this wings have the perfect size for my 8 month old baby, but the material is so so so rigid, but perfectly done... love the finished"
3,Small Angel Wings,"Delivery was awesome... Very fast... But--- However beautiful these Angel Wings look, they should NOT be advertised as 'Child"" size... They are tiny... TODDLER size ( about the size of a notebook)... The online picture of the Angel dress, halo and wings show them as being much MUCH larger... My granddaughter is 5 and they look lost on her... Maybe my expectations were higher because of how beautiful they were shown in the picture with the dress... Instead of these huge, beautiful, angel wings, they are simply tiny and do not really show on either side of her when facing forward... Totally ruined the look as compared to the pictures online... Trying to return them... Wish me luck!"
4,"Cute, little wings.","I bought these wings to go with a Halloween costume. I chose children-sized wings because I didn't want them to be smacking on every person I walked past. They're very cute and the set of wings I received looked better than the picture, as far as the condition of the feathers. The straps aren't uncomfortable and are big enough for a teenager or petite woman to fit--it will be taut because it's not designed for those sizes, but it looks precious and doesn't dangle sloppily as some of the heavier wings do. One problem is you have to be careful putting them on and taking them off because the fuzzy top half of the wings can get damaged (but this, for me, was only on the side against my shoulders where no one would see it anyway)."
3,"Gorgeous wings, straps too tight","Wings are as beautiful in person as they are online; still can't believe they cost $6. I was at least as excited as my daughter to get them. As a pleasant surprise, I like the rigid design -- they don't fold in the center like so many costume wings -- so they stay in place rather than flopping about.However, sadly, the elastic straps were too tight on my 4 1/2 year old. She complained and took them off immediately.I hate to ding their rating but seems like 4-5 year old should be somewhere in their sweet spot age/size-wise. Otherwise, they should make them in different sizes or make the straps adjustable. Well, we'll keep them for costume collection. Perfect if you have a smaller child to outfit."
3,Smaller than expected,"These are cute, but were too tight on athletic three year old, and he report that there are not enough feathers to even really pretend to fly. Would be good for angel costume for smaller child. More satisfying and engaging for adults viewing much adored children than for the children themselves, I think."
4,"Great Costume, not a toy.",Our granddaughter was absolutely charming as an angel thanks to this product. The wings are de luxe indeed but feathers are not particularly durable and these would not serve for unsupervised play. I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,My Little Angels 2,This is a wonderful product. My Grandsons had a photo shoot dressed as Angels and they looked so cute. I would definitely recommend it.
1,Shoddy wings that don't look like picture!,"I'm not happy at all with these wings. They are not the same shape or proportion as in the advertised picture. They look like a rectangular piece of cardboard covered with feathers instead of the pretty, curved wings in the picture. Three feathers had already fallen off inside the box it was shipped to me in. They are also not 15 inches across, they are only 13.5 inches across. I am very disappointed."
1,Should only be used by little angels.,part of a halloween costume for a 4-year old. The feathers starting coming off/not laying flat early on in the day. Never used.
2,Pretty bad,The feathers that protrude are about half the length of the displayed picture. My wing came with a missing edge feather and cardboard showing at the lower left tip which made it look pathetic.
4,Not Disappointed,"These are cardboard wings with feathers glued on. Nothing fancy, but for the price, they are a great value for a Halloween costume."
3,"A bit ruffled up, but cute.","I got this for my 15mo olds Halloween costume (he's a cherub this year!). The elastic for around the arms is way too big, but that's ok cause I just cut it to size and put a few stitches in to make it fit. The feathers aren't bent or broken, but are a bit roughshod looking right out of the bag. The wing size itself is perfect for him, so ill be keeping it. Can't argue with the price!"
4,Beautiful,"These wings are great, although the shed feathers after a very short time. They're still beautiful with speedy delivery and unique appeal. Buy them;)"
5,A Wonderful Feel Good Movie,"This is a DVD you buy and set away for those rainy day pick me ups. There is a great line in this film. ""Da two yoots."" It is a code word for my wife. When we need a good laugh she says ""it's time for da two yoots."""
5,It gets funnier each time you watch it!,"Watch it once, and you say, ""That was funny!""Watch it again and you pick up on things you missed the first time.Watch it a few more times and you can quote every word and it is funny as hell!!!You begin to realize this is a well written story.Then you can start to apply it to your own life and you are a better person!There are a lot of life lessons in this.YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!Andy"
5,A MUST SEE!,"I totally enjoyed this movie. It starts out with twoyoung Italian boys on their way to college. While traveling through a small town in Alabama they are falsely accused of murder and Bill calls home asking for a lawyer to be sent to help them. The family send Bill's cousin Vinny, who has never tried his first case.Vinny is played by Joe Pesci and his girlfirend is played by Marisa Tomei. What an outstanding couple they made in this movie. I laughed myself silly and shared it with everyone I knew. Think about it! A Northern Italian Lawyer in a Southern town, you can imagine the friction, but oh the comedy that is there. If you haven't watched this movie yet, you need to run out and get it. You won't be sorry, it is great!"
4,Pesci and Tomei make an unbeatable team,"Easily Pesci's best work since Raging Bull, he gives an over the top performance both in and out of the courtroom. Best scene is when he first meets with his clients in their jail cell, some great double entendre. Austin Pendleton steals the movie as the tongue-tied public defender."
4,Gotta love Joe Pesci,"This movie is Joe Pesci at his finest, even though Home Alone was good, it didn't display all his acting. This shows his comedic side and his dramatic side. The movie does seem to run-on in some scenes, but that don't matter, great movie, anybody can laugh watching this movie."
5,Vinny Is The Ultimate Goomba!!,"Famous Goomba Characters (Do you recognize them all?)""Vinny Gambini"" (My Cousin Vinny)""Vinny Barbarino"" (Welcome Back, Kotter)""Arthur Fonzarelli"" (Happy Days)""Tony Micelli"" (Who's The Boss)""Vinnie Delpino"" (Doogie Howser, MD)""Columbo"" (Columbo)""Joey Tribbiani"" (Friends)""George Costanza"" (Seinfeld)""Sophia Petrillo"" (The Golden Girls)""Mario & Luigi"" (Super Mario Bros)""Tony Manero"" (Saturday Night Fever)""Maria Ragetti"" (Grumpier Old Men)""Frankie Zito"" (Kiss Me Guido)""Rocky Balboa"" (Rocky)""Monty Capuletti"" (Easy Money)"
3,Funny,The transfer to bluray is nice. I wish there had been more special or extra features to go with this.
4,Superb Pesci,"Hilarious - One of my favorite movies. Pesci and Tomei (wow!) are great. Easy to watch - kept a good pace the whole way through. Many classic scenes. Good to see Fred Gwynn, he does a nice job as the judge."
3,Acceptable Transfer of a Classic Fish-out-of-Water Comedy,"This review is for the quality of the blu-ray transfer and not the film itself. The blu-ray version of My Cousin Vinny features increased sharpness over an upscaled DVD image. The level of detail for hair, fabric and wood grain is all improved. When words appear, the lines are crisp. There is noticeable film grain in some scenes, however, more than one would find in a newer movie. It was most noticeable in lower light conditions, which is to be expected. More problematic was the color, which seemed a bit washed out and faded, particularly in some of the courtroom scenes. The sound was fine.This is not the kind of movie that I would normally upgrade to blu-ray. It is not an action movie, nor does it have much in the way of scenic vistas. So if you have the DVD version, you may be content to stay with that. For those who are blu-ray purists, however, always wanting the best edition of a film, well, this is it."
5,filmed in my town,This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. It was filmed in Covington georgia where I grew up at and now I live in NY so I appreciate this movie even more. Makes me miss home. Anyway this movie is awesome.
4,Thanks for being so prompt,"Thanks for being so prompt. Have not watched the movie yet, but I'm sure it's fine."
4,Great movie; OK DVD,"My Cousin Vinny is my favorite comedy movie. The plot is simple and you can easily guess the outcome from the start. The journey is what you will enjoy. The fun is non-stop. Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei were a delightful combination. I had seen it several times on TV and was always irritated by the way the audio was blocked in some scenes. It seems the language was offensive to someone, even though it isn't that much worse than prime time TV. Being able to enjoy the movie without wondering what was said makes it worth the purchase price. And if you are like me, you will enjoy it more than once.My four star rating is due to the lack of extras. Most DVDs have extras that are at least marginally interesting and informative. The only true extra was the commentary, and compared to what I've been used to on other DVDs, this one didn't provide measure up. Not even close. The other so-called extras were promos. If you have the movie you don't need the trailer."
5,"Excellent movie, tough language","Great movie (very funny!), but best watched on tv unless you like the ""f"" word. This movie runs pretty often on cable tv, so be on the lookout for it!"
1,Rated R,"This is advertised as the made for TV edition that is rated PG. What we got was the R rated edition. My kids got to hear two F-bombs before we could shut it off. Gee, thanks! Great quality control guys./sarc Seriously, I am OUTRAGED that we were misled and that my young kids were exposed to the very vulgarity that we strove to avoid. This movie is hilarious...if it is the made for TV edition. Beware!!! This was a bait and switch."
1,Very poor disc and service,"Even though I love the actual movie, the DVD's quality was horrible. There were so many scratches and smudges on it that I was very surprised that it even played! Also the case was defective and allowed the disc to free float inside. Very disapointed in the final product."
1,my mistake,wanted this movie thought I was ordering DVD instead it was VHS. I either missed that or it was not large enough for me to notice
2,"Good acting, but badly made movie and boring script",This is one of the rarest movies that I could not finish watching. Not recommended.
4,Marisa Tomei&#65533;s Oscar victory went here,"Sorry, I never saw this film in which Joe Pesci has the lead role. I'm referring to Marisa Tomei, who won the 1992 Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this. I saw her in another movie (""Only You"") which I thought wasn't THAT bad. But why hasn't she done anything new in these past couple of years? Her most recent film was ""Slums of Beverly Hills.""You'll never believe this, but I can imagine Marisa and Andrea Bocelli in a film, peaceful in silence, quarreling in public. Joe and Andrea would be great for a mentally-sick Italian brother duo traveling to Mexico or perhaps Puerto Rico and singing in a music school! But Bocelli is blind, and it seems he ain't fit for Hollywood. Disappointing, huh?It's time to say goodbye for today."
1,Defective DVD,First copy would not play in Blu Ray player. Returned it for another...it did not play either. This is the only DVD where I had this problem
4,This Is The Most Realistic Courtroom Movie Ever Made,"As a trial attorney, I usually detest courtroom dramas and comedies, as they are invariably too unrealistic. This movie, despite its goofball premise, captures the dynamics of the courtroom so accurately that it is often shown in continuing legal education seminars (I am not kidding). The courtroom sequences are so on target that they are frighteningly real and hold up well on repeated viewings. A fine, funny movie."
5,NORTH meets SOUTHERN JUSTICE,"When his cousin (Ralph Macchio) is arrested for murdering a store clerk, a Brooklyn lawyer (Joe Pesci) travels south to take the case. Sure, a New Yorker likes to shovel a few shortcuts. But southern justice is not casual or backwards as FRED GWYNNE, the judge, repeatedly makes clear.Good mystery, terrific comedy, engaging story. Pesci--the lawyer and his girlfriend (Marcia Tomei) are a terrific comedy team, the couple from hell. This is the type of film to be seen over and over and not misviewed from chop-shop TV-Network versions."
5,Love it and my wife too,Is a classic movie that's the first movie I watch with my wife when we first date so I love it
3,Needed to cover other areas,"The book was surprisingly involving, and brought back some memories from first time experiences. However, It could improve by being more adult orientated (not ...) but more ...discussions and size matters i.e"
1,Offensive Sex Tips for ... Gay Guys,"I'm guessing that the intent of this book was to be humurous and informative. Instead it ends up being offensive and useless. Unless you are a gay man that has lived in a cave for the last 20 years and likes to be referred to as a ""poof"", there is no need to buy this book. Dan Anderson's advice is both trivial and wrong. Does anyone need to be told to circulate (or as he calls it, ""twirl"") around a bar in order to meet people? And if I followed his advice to just up and leave a bar when it's time for me to leave, without telling my friends, I would be one friendless guy. Even the cover of the book is offensive, depicting every gay male sterotype that there is. You'd be much better off using the money for this book to go buy yourself a cocktail or 2 and see what happens."
3,Steak Tips,"I tried a sample of this book ergo reads like a one sided, seedless watermelon with en elementary aftertaste. Although ''Homoland'' was generously given to us in this book as a fictional guiding tool, there should be truths that lands like these exist. Ogunquit, ME, Unity, NH, Provinceton, MA, Providence, RH, are just a few to name."
4,Read but Beware,"I saw Meryl Streep in Hope Springs and a book was read entitled Sex Tips for Straight Women from a gay guy. I googled and came across this book from the same author, so I bought it. It has outdated advice as it was printed in the early 2000's, but some solid advice also. I am 58 years old, and I believe this book is more appropraite for people in their teens, twenties, or just coming out. It is easy to read, and if you take it with a grain of salt, some valuable guides that even I found useful. Other guides, not so much given my age and experience in social issues.By the way, the cover has a guy with a banana used for practice. I have not seen any chapters which actually refer to that banana."
1,"The plot was the worst I've seen, but the acting was great","As for being a ""spiritual"" movie, it was extremly lacking. The entire movie was slightly akward and jumpy. The acting, which was supreme, was the only thing that kept me watching. However, that was excellent, expecially from Going and Flannery. The characters were obviously well developed and very in turn very well potrayed."
1,Save you money for something better,"Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I would have walked out on it only I was in my living room. I hoped it would somehow redeem itself so I watched until the bitter end, and believe me, the end weas not bitter but a blessing."
4,Just as described.,"No surprises, they look just like they are pictured and described. Holding up well against the heavy load my husband likes to hang on them."
5,great for the gym,"bought this because my combination lock sometimes took forever to open, with this one now I dont have to stand buck naked and while I try to open my locker. Nice."
1,false advertising,1.6 ounces?? NOPE! Try 4 ounces without the keys. Looking for ultra lightweight for urban backpacking (hostels).... this is not it!
4,Vita K Solution,"I have used this product before and even though I don't see any great improvement, I think it is the best that is available."
3,"one of those ""if only..."" books","VERY well written book on the function of women artists during the surrealist movement - both as muse for the men and as artists in their own right. The unspoken ""maleness' of surrealism is also one of the first movements that allowed (somewhat hesitantly) women to be members and equals. There are ALOT of paintings shown by the main women artists (Kahlo, Tanning, Sage, Carrington, Fini, Toyen) however almost ALL are in black and white and small. The women of surrealism seem in most cases to have a far deeper intention to use color in their work as a form of expressing emotion than the men in general, however this gets lost in B&W. It does make you crave books by the individual artists, tho, so that's not a bad thing. Definitely get this book, but be prepared for wanting more."
4,The Female Touch,"People seem to believe that surrealism was all Dali, Magritte, Breton an Co when some of the great contributions to the form came from women. This is an excellent addition to the oeuvre and well worth the read. For those interested in surrealism, another book I would recommend arises from Carlos Lozano's long and totally weird friendship with Salvador DaliSex Surrealism Dali & Me"
3,An introduction to Jesus and the Jesus movement,"If you are looking for a fast, simple introduction to Jesus and Christianity, this is a superb starting place. There is more comic-strip illustration than text, and it does try to cover all the basics in a very short space, from issues such as who Jesus thought he was or was not, as the case may be, who his followers thought he was, through to the early Church and on to phenomena such as liberation theology.It could be used as a resource for groups wanting stimulating discussion."
5,"Good for all ages, well written, well illustrated","The information is accurate and written in an easy-to-understand format. The line drawings are interesting without being distracting or confusing. The book sticks to one topic, and one topic only. This reassuring and informative book can be enjoyed by girls of any age. Since girls are maturing early, and need this information at such a young age, I appreciate how this book could be shared with a young child without introducing sexual issues that the child isn't ready for."
5,Great for Young Girls,"My daughter is nine... I wanted something that would help her with ""the basics"" without getting into too much detail about sex. I was looking for something that would focus on HER body and how she is feeling... this book did that perfectly!"
5,A wonderful book for young women.,"This book explains menstruation in simple and medically acurate terms. It does not perpetuate any negative myths about menstruation either. I was very happy to see the section on alternative menstrual products, and also happy that it addressed the dangers of Toxic Shock Syndrome.This book answers all the normal questions about menstruation, but it also gives great examples about how different every woman's body is and enforces the idea that being different is normal.I highly suggest getting this book for young women to learn about menstruation."
5,Great Book,"When my 9 year old daughter started asking me questions about her body, I knew it was time for the talk. But I wanted to be prepared so I searched and searched for just the right book. I didn't want to get into SEX or male organs (that's a whole different talk). We really bonded by reading this book and discussing it together. She is now well informed about the changes that she will be going thru. This is a great book and perfect for younger girls."
4,"Good, but not as fun to read as others","I purchased this book for my 12 year old daughter. It is an informative book with some monochromatic illustrations. I also purchased ""Ready, Set, Grow"". My daughter's opinion is that ""Ready, Set, Grow"" was an easier reading style, more colorful and more fun to read. I have to agree with her. I also enjoyed reading the other book more than this one.I would recommend this book, but if you're only going to buy ONE book, I'd recommend ""Ready, Set, Grow""."
5,Period: a girls guide,I enjoyed reading this book it was informative and written in simple easy to understand style. My 10 year old daughter also liked the book because it was uncomplicated and they broke down this very complex period of life into words and illustrations that she could both relate to and understand.We both read the book together which assisted in our mother/daughter relationship as it was something we could share. I also like the fact that the book looked beyond periods and talked about overall wellness and health of the pre-teen. I would encourage any mother with a child about to enter puberty to purchase this book for their pre-teen.Wanjie
5,Excellent for the 8 years and up!!,Wanted to have additional information for my granddaughter as she was maturing quite rapidly. Perfect for her and provided additional dialogue between her and grandma. Recommend highly for this age group. Deals with subject matter and not sexually explicit as many other books that are out there
3,Very telling,"This is a very telling book of where certain people in high places in international forums think we should go and what we should do as a whole.Written in 1972 and with a forward by none other than Maurice Strong, globalist, fear monger, and general enemy of nation states and civil liberties.These are the people that wish to rule your daily lives for you and I.Worth the read.Think the global warming hoax started recently?Wrong. Read the book.Wake the hell up America and join the infowar!"
2,proceed with caution,"A little Yoko goes a long way. A few instruction poems are silly fun. A whole book of them is too much, at one time. The edition I have has the pictures of Hubby and his endorsement. He had a real sense of humor so I wonder what was going on there but he's not saying. Anyway, there's a same-ness. Do something so the environment looks different. Do something until you die. Do something so that Yoko makes money (whoops!)Is Yoko real or did Monty Python make her up? I ask because sometimes she seems like the perfect parody of a concept artist. She instructs, ""drill a small, almost invisible, hole in the center of the canvas and see the room through it."" She makes holey canvases and sells them for thousands of dollars! Hey Mrs. Lennon, where's the instructional poem about how to wow the critics?"
3,BOOK KNOWN ONLY THANKS TO JOHN LENNON,"Well, the book is at the very least original, like nothing I have ever read before and for that it deserves some credit.But I truly believe a book like this one would have disappeared into total obscurity if it has not been for Yoko's marriage to John.In fact, everything about the woman would have just vanished from this world's memory if it had not been for her relationship to John and his endorsement to all she did."
2,My one word review,"A prior commentator invited us to give a one word review of this book, ""Grapefruit."" Here is mine:Lemon."
1,Thank Goodness She Married John Lennon,"I always thought Yoko Ono was a little bit strange. However, after reading this book I realize how wrong I was -- she is VERY strange. This book has no redeeming features. It only serves to illuminate the very twisted mind of Yoko Ono. If not for John Lennon, would we ever have heard of her? I don't think so."
5,"Wacky, funny and something for everyone","Grapefruit has something for everyone, even if you are dead straight. It's nuts and philosophical at the same time .. can take your mind far. Love it."
5,"Justice, please, for Yoko","Yoko ono deserves a litle justice for her great creative work. This book of instructions shows the innovation of a real conceptual artist that not to many peopple know about her. This is a realy interesting, funny, helpful and inteligent book. Buy it, even thouh you're not into Yoko stuff. You will become a fan"
4,marvelous,"there's not lot to say, this book is so marvelous. after i've read it, i only want to make my own Grapefruit that comes with abstract but beautiful instructions like this. so inspiring and could be a bridge to those who love art, philosophy, and literature.Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings by Yoko Ono"
2,POOR REMASTER,"I RECENTLY RETURNED THIS ALBUM 32.00$ AND THE SOUND WAS AWFUL IRECENTLY BOUGHT DORIS DAY WITH LES BROWN AND HIS ORCHESTRA LOST TREASURES NOW THATS HOW A REMASTER SHOULD SOUND LIKE,DORIS DAY GOLDEN GIRL OH SO GOOD THE SOUND THE ANGEL VOICE SO CLEAR YOU WOULD THINK IT WAS RECORDED TODAY. I LOVE,LOVE DORIS DAY BUT THE REMASTER ON COMPLETE RECORDINGS WITH LES BROWN WAS AWFUL I RETURNED THIS ALBUM, FOLKS BUT THE OTHER TWO THAT I PUT IN THIS REVIEW NOT THIS ONE. DAVID VENDITTO"
1,Advertising gimmick,"This book is a pure marketing book for Moon Pies. It even includes a coupon for Moon Pies in the back. The story itself is quite engaging. It describes a boy who travels to outer space to get his Moon Pies. He even pacifies a monster on Mars with a Moon Pie. The entire book is dedicated to increasing the reader&#65533;s desire to purchase and eat Moon Pies- -completely despicable. The author is not content to simply market Moon Pies; he also suggests that Moon Pies are preferable to nutritious foods like Brussels sprouts and beans. If you would like to see your child join the ranks of the morbidly obese, for heaven sakes, buy this book. And there&#65533;s an Oreo counting book you&#65533;d probably like as well."
5,Love Manga,"This is a great Manga. I love the video series, which is now not being sold, because the distributor went out of business. The whole series is great, charming, funny, and interesting with an added element of a little horror/gruesome fight scenes. Any anime lover will adore this book!"
4,Blilss Hammock,"This hammock arrived and I have it stretched on pawley stand, replacing a traditional island cotton hammock. The fabric seems thin but it holds at least one person and is very comfortable. The cotton is really smooth and looks great in the backyard. The only thing I will say is that the wind has a tendency to flip this hammock and stand over together. I'm happy to try this out and see how many seasons this will last."
2,Tiny and scratchy.,I did not like this necklace. The crystal beads are tiny and they are scratchy. I would not recommend it. It is not worth the money.
2,Poor video quality,The movie was very good. It encourages to you to think about the meaning of life. The video quality was not acceptable for an original dvd movie. I think there should be better quality control on dvds' sold on-line.
2,Christian dvds,This movie was a disappointment. I could have simply taken a camera and simply record it in my house. It does not look like a movie. The plot is slow. This movie was a waste of money
3,It's ok,"I would not recommend this to a friend, the story line is ridiculous. I was disappointed in the story line."
3,weird,"Got the video. Put it in, Right away I felt something was wrong, but I didn't know what. just got a sick feeling. The opening scene was confusing. Almost took it out a few times. Acting was terrible, like very inexperienced or unemployed porn actors, decent special effects though. Weird part is that about two days later, as I slept, a hole from hell opened in what I hope was a dream in the bed next to me, it was the devil looking for his movie. The video took about 2 weeks to arrive, I think they sent it to Haiti to put a curse on it. The copyright warning said that it could not be rented. Unless you want a visit from the devil I wouldn't recommend it!"
5,Suspense,"this movie holds you on the edge of your seat, it is unexpectedly great and unbelievable. this movie was worth buying."
1,NOT VERY GOOD,"Not happy with the quality of the movie .was very poor acting in the movie,would not advise you to purchase this movie"
4,Good Christian movie,"I thought this was a good movie that was better than some of these other movies that deal with hell. The actors were good and the plot also. I would recommend this movie for a church library, which is what I did with mine after I watched it. After donating this to our church library;others watched it and were happy with it. By the way, the movie was delivered promptly."
3,do something about it,"If you have any doubts about heaven or hell, you can cross reference a lot of facts in the BIBLE. You can borrow one from the Library or buy one, old or new fairly in-expensive. Escape from Hell is not a fiction but quite a fact for those who do believe.If there is ""Life"" after death, it deserves invastigation.Would'nt you rather be wrong if it ends up not to be true? What if you don't believe and it does exist. Then what?"
2,not too great,"I order & watched this movie last year, and as far as Christian films go, I personally have seen MUCH better-I can't explain it too well, except that the acting was just OK, and the film type they used felt home-movieish & amateurish. The messages they were conveying were right on the money, tho. The special effects were good, tho, and the idea about the sign on top of the hospital was really clever. Would I buy it again? Hmm, probably not. It didn't give me chills once."
3,Less than expected.,"In spite of the hype from Rev. John Hagee, this film comes across as almost silly. The message is significant but it's delivered in a noncredible and simplistic way so it's not very engaging or entertaining. It's easy to step away from to go for snacks without fear of missing anything significant. It might be more impactful for children who won't demand a very cinema worthy production to be entertained."
2,Escape from Hell,"For as much hype as there was about this movie, it was not as good as I expected. Actors did a fair job with acting. I don't know how old the movie is, but effects in it weren't good either. Good plot, it was just not done very good. Sorry I spent the money, but thats the only way to find out."
2,Escape from Hell DVD,"I was very disappointed in this dvd. Although it has a good message, the scenes from Hell were laughable. I do not recommend it at all."
2,Not thrilled with this case,"I bought this case so that it would protect my new ipod classic, and for the belt clip.The case itself is OK, however the ""cushioning"" inside is about the thickness of a piece of paper, so I don't really see how it cushions. IMHO, the case will protect the ipod from minor scratches and dents (not on the video screen though) but not more than that.The belt clip is a swivel clip so the ipod moves around like crazy. The clip itself is also very weak and will slip off of what it is clipped to. It actually slipped off and dropped in the first 15 minutes I used it. All I did was sit down, and boom, the ipod dropped and hit the floor. My old belt clip that I used with my Mini, never did this. Once it was clipped, it was clipped, and it never fell off or moved around, even when running.Very disappointing. I would send it back, but the cost of shipping is about how much I paid so it is not worth the headache."
3,"Good case, weak clip",This case is inexpensive and has saved my iPod several times when I dropped it. I keep it in my pocket because the belt clip snapped off with almost no pressure. I still use it daily.
2,Didn't fit my IPod. Too small.,"This didn't fit my IPod, it was too small. I was very disappointed. The description given said it was for my model Classic IPod. However, maybe my IPod too old and most IPods as old as mine have gone to the junk pile. So there aren't cases for them. Even the man at the Apple store was impressed it was still working. Same IPod, but this would have been the third protective case. So the protective cases in the past have done their job."
5,Grandson Loves it,"Built to last, just like they were 50 years ago. I got my first Tonka Truck in 1954."
5,Very informative and thought-provoking,"This is a neat book! It starts out with a chapter about Barbara Kingsolver, quite chatty and very interesting. And then there is a much longer chapter about the Poisonwood Bible, which is one of my favourites. This chapter is quite deep and occasionally too 'academic', but most of it is clear and it has made me think about the book. I'm now reading the novel again, and I'm enjoying it even more. The book finishes with three short chapters about how people liked the novel when it came out, and about how it did so well. All of which is interesting in its own way, too. I'm going to read more of Kingsolver's novels now.If you enjoy thinking about books, and seeing things that you didn't really know were there, and if you loved the Poisonwood Bible, I can recommend this book. The author did a good job!"
3,So-so,"This contains a few errors here and there although nothing big. It's worth maybe $6 or $8, not the $10 I paid for it. This is reasonably useful if you're writing a paper on the book and are the type to get lost in the story and miss some of the larger picture. Otherwise, not really."
1,doesn't even deserve 1 star,"The big problem is it freezes. Screen goes blank - lit up actually, but blank - and stays that way until you power it off and on again. While it's frozen, no calls can be received - it is completely nonfunctional, but ... and this is the good part (sarcasm) the battery goes dead within a matter of minutes. So, you've got a freshly charged battery, which normally would last for 3 or 4 days (depending on usage), and you head out, and take out your phone and ... surprise ... frozen, or worse, battery completely dead. If it was frozen, the amount of battery life left will depend on how long it was frozen.My wife has the same phone and doesn't have this problem, but I've read complaints from others who do. Replacing the sim card doesn't help."
1,"Garbage, junk",Purchased a whole set of these batteries for a PanasonicKX-TG2008B corded/cordless system and they all failed in a very short time. Don't waste your money.
3,Cuteish.....,"I saw this ""Perfect Petzz"" at a flea market in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. At the time I thought it was preety dumb. It seemed a lot like those ""Fur Real"" friend dolls (all my friends wanted when I was like 5) that looked like walking robots and you would have to throw them across the room to shut up. I soon got to like these little dogs. A labrador retriever owner myself I thought for someone who want a dog that you can just turn the off swich to ""OFF"" to make it's barks 'magiclly' dissapear is a graet toy for those who are alergic to dogs or just absolutely hate them. I have to say, they are preety cute... and the breathing does look real... so if you really want one.... buy one, But whatever you do....Dont give it a bath!"
2,thin towel,"My daughter, a ""Sponge Bob freak"" for whom I purchased two towels was very disappointed with the quality. She says tat they are not as absorbent as she expected,"
4,Coolpix 4500 is exactly that.......really cool,"The most awe inspiring and versatile camera I have ever owned... and I have had quite a few. I am a graphic designer and this camera completes my studio nicely. I take mostly studio shots of fruits and still life and the detail and clarity is nothing short of amazing. There is only one downfall and that is, my finger seems to always be in the way of the pop up flash. Folks with large hands may find holding the camera a bit uncomfortable, but performance is top notch."
4,It is a good camera !,"I bought it in June, has taken a lot of pictures, the color quality is almost perfect, although the price is a little bit high now, with some promotion and free shipment from Amazon, it is still a good deal. Hi, guys! do not waste your time comparing among the cameras, real color comes first, Nikon's color is what you need !"
5,A new old friend,"The Nikon 4500 was the end of the line for the large, swivil body line that Nikon pioneered. Brought out in 2003, it was a great camera that I enjoyed using very much. In addition, I purchased many accessories to go with it. Earlier this year, my old freind suffered a fall and was damaged. I debated about sending it to a repair facility, or just buying a new camera. You can imagine my delight when I found a ""like new"" model on Amazon for only $100. Instead of being like new, it was new, unopened in the original box. Now I am back taking excellent pictures with a camera I am familiar with, and one that I can do a number of things with because of all the accesories I have accumulated. This was a great deal."
4,"Good, But Flawed.","I spent a year using and abusing the 990 coolpix in severe conditions on the job and fell in love with it inspite of some flaws (Needed higher resolution, chromatic aberations were pretty nasty and the control/ menu system was written for geeks).The 995 came out and I passed on it as I thought it should have had that higher resolution.When the 4500 appeared, it seemed like it was everything I wanted. They simplified the controls (but they are still too clumsy), bumped up the resolution and made the whole thing smaller. But they also shrank the LCD window down to where it borders on useless. I am now planning on replacing this camera with the 5400 as soon as it comes out. I wish they had left that window alone..."
2,"too much,& not enough!",">When I first read about the 4500, I was really excited about some of the features advertised,especially the macro feature.(I am a tattoo artist, and this feature helps with documenting my work)Unfortunately,the camera is not really living up to my high expectations;>It's macro feature never seems to capture a clear photo.(either blurry ,too dark,or the flash washes the image out.)>It's auto focus doesn't do much better.>Technical support seemed futile each time I tried.>It seems nearly impossible to get any point and shoot from the camera at all.>There is one feature that I enjoy, and that's the 35 second film snips it produces...otherwise, I'd recommend a more user friendly camera."
1,Two major dissatisfications for Nikon Coolpix 4500,"My first complaint/advice is about the ""purported"" rebates offered by Nikon. After sending in much documentation, they still refused after several letters to respond and reimburse with the promised rebate. They have a laundry checklist of reason used to ""stiff"" customers and not pay. They appear to beunconcerned with their own corporate image or past customer loyalty. Eventually I had to get my rebate from the originalseller who was embarassed by their corporate behavior.Additionally, if you don't mind being fleeced about the rebate, you will also find the flash to be underpowered...making me regret even more that I had taken this supposed ""step up"" from an Olympus digital camera.Finally, reviews I read about the complicated and unfathomable menus were right on the money.Unless you don't value money, want dark pictures or have a month to try to decipher their menus and manuals, don't buy this (and maybe any other Nikon) product."
5,Nikon Coolpix 4500,This camera was recommended for microscopic photography. It is excellent for that purpose. The seller (Snuffy's Outhouse) was very prompt and his description of the camera accurate.
4,Still a great camera,This is still a great camera. Nikon pioneered some features that others have followed. I like to use of add-on lenses for the CoolPix; too bad this feature has not been continued.
5,Great little camera,I've owned this camera for a long time and have have shot thousands of pictures with it. I even use it with a Kaidan panoramic mount and both the fisheye and wide angle lenses without any problems. All I can add is that it is a tough camera with lots of features and great quality.
1,JUNK,"Just after the one year warranty and I turn on the camera to hear loud clicking noises. Have to take the battery out to shut off. ""SYSTEM ERROR"". $200 to repair from Nikon - oh and they won't tell me what's wrong with it. I'm not the only one. My friend had the same problem, but he had it repaired in greece for $100. I've read that a number of people have had the same problem, actually some on Amazon reviews, where are they now?Way to go Nikon. I won't be a return customer thank you."
3,I like the option to cut the instructor's voice out,"the DVD practice offers two 35 minutes practices, the first covers basic poses like down facing dog, warrior positions and a few hip twists; the second is more to relax and release stress from the body that uses a lot of props like 2X blankets, blocks and a wall. In addition, there are two 10-min guided practices: meditation and relaxation, which i wished both were longer.Both 35 minutes session were very gentle and instructions were clear. If you are particularly new to yoga, I think you will enjoy this DVD. I store a lot of stress in my upper body and found this dvd useful, but not targeted for my specific needs. However, I still got a lot out of using the DVD and still felt the release; but I do need to supplement this dvd with a more targeted stress reliever for particulary bad days.I recommend this dvd to learn about breathing, which is absolutely critical for any yoga practice and the ability to relax, which this dvd does address."
5,It can be used by beginners new to yoga as well as advanced practitioners of yoga.,"Practice routines offered in Yoga for Stress cover stress prevention, stress relief, and focus on areas of the body where stress accumulates. It sounds complicated but it offers up an easily-followed program of movements which offers three quick relaxation techniques along with stress relief practices and alternate practice modes. Another plus: it can be used by beginners new to yoga as well as advanced practitioners of yoga.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
2,Too Fast-Paced,"For a Yoga DVD that is supposed to help reduce stress, I thought theroutines in this one were too fast-paced. There is a strange pausefeature that is completely useless in practice. The Body Wisdom Yogafor stress DVD is much better, at least in my opinion."
2,okay,i was gonna use this for by little brother birthday toy but then right when i about to ship it there were non left.lesson here always be prereped!
4,Great Book For Young Pokemon Lovers!,Find Pokemon II is a fun way to encourage young readers. It makes your child use his/her perception skills to find these favorite characters and read a story along the way. Drawings are colorful and full of activity.
5,Every homeowner needs Decorating For Good!,I have been looking forever for a book that would help make my home more beautiful and comfortable. I love all my things but for some reason I just couldn't get it to feel right. I didn't know if I needed to start over with new furniture or if I had the wrong things to begin with. Decorating For Good helped me step by step with placing everything in my room. After following all the guidelines I couldn't believe the transformation! It looked amazing! I realize now what a difference the correct placement can make. This book truly is a god-send.
2,"disappointing, no visual content","In the overcrowded decorating book market, there is nothing new in ""Decorating For Good."" It looks as if Ms. Talbott is trying to copy Laurie Ward's book ""Use What You Have Decorating."" Personally, I was very disappointed in the book's content. (No photographs, and only amateur line drawings.) I feel the book is overpriced for what you get."
2,wish i had read the reviews,"she makes a lot of promises but does not deliver. it is NOT simple to understand, NOT clearly written, and NOT well illisturated.she does not address the ""what if"" questions. her formula only seems to work if you already own what she describes and if your room matches her basic shapes. if you are stuck after the first step (placing the sofa in front of the focal point) you are out of luck--because she just rolls on telling you and promising you how everything will come together and make sense. her drawings seem to contradict what she says and make no SENSE."
1,Disappointing,Too bad this book promises so much and delivers so little. Not much in the way of new ideas or originality. A little too much selling on the part of the author.
2,Disappointing after 18 mos of hype!,"I've been waiting for this book to be published after seeing Carole's Website, and after sending for Visual Coordinations registration materials. I think if you had never read a home decor magazine or flipped through some of the decorating books out for the last 10 years, this would seem brand new. Only one idea seemed fresh to me, and that was of patterning lighting sources in a room in a triangle format. All other pages were good ideas, but same, same, same as what everyone else is doing. Disappointing after looking forward to the book's release for so long, and thinking it would help me solve some awkward room layout problems."
1,A total waste of time and money,"I can't believe I spent money to read about this author's ego trip and sales pitch for her business. What transparent hype!Other books on the market are far superior to this one in that they actually showed me how to make my home look so much better. I love decorating and I'm always looking for new ideas, but this was a mistake.My living room looked 100% better before I tried the so-called""formula."" I want my money back."
2,No introspection,"I admit I did not finish the book, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt. The dustjacket review compares Shahar to Proust. There is truth in this, in that Shahar weaves a narrative from remembrances and images, and then reweaves them from other angles. Myself, I'm more of a Musil or Oz or Rilke person. I like introspection. I want to know what characters are thinking, and what deep thoughts the author has on the world and our experience of it. Page after page of Shahar I just read more images. Perhaps they build to a symphony, but I was left wanting more, not satisfied with recollections, even if Proustian."
5,Perfect beach read!,"This is great for any true prep, especially at the beach. I took this along to Hilton Head with my fellow preps and it made us long for the 80s, thirsty, and eventually very intoxicated! This makes a good companion to the Official Preppy Handbook."
4,"Preppy memories, anyone?","To really appreciate a book about preppy drinking in the 80s, you had to have been a preppy drinker in the 80s! Reading TIM brought me right back to the days of drinking Tab & rum while pulling all-nighters in prep school and college...This is a PERFECT gift for a fellow preppy friend =D."
3,OK as eye candy,"This movie is nothing special. I did manage to watch the full piece however found the ending slightly disappointing.The story itself is nothing spectacular. The acting is mediocre. The two actors are very good looking and if you like looking at good looking males well, I suppose you will not be disappointed.A more honest rating rather than 2 or 3 would be 2.5"
1,"RUN, do not walk","sucks. save your money. (now i am just satisfying the word minimum...la de da...doo be doo be dooo. oh man!!! so twenty words, or more? YIKES.)"
1,"Beautiful, naked bodies are not enough","Nothing here makes sense. The action all takes place in the space of a long weekend, it appears. And the ""action"" is so intense, swinging from one unbelievable melodrama to another, that my credulity was stretched and then broken. The resolution to the film came out of nowhere, and instead of being a pleasant surprise made me say, aloud, ""What the f. . .?""The world is filled with beautiful men willing to get naked on film in gay-themed Indies. If only the ""creative"" teams behind these movies could understand that beautiful, naked bodies are not enough to make a good film."
5,Healthy Homes 101,"Homes that Heal is a comprehensive look at how our homes impact our daily health and our long term health. As a green building supplies retailer, Homes that Heal is the first book we turn to for that customer looking to improve their indoor environment. I have researched the topic of healthy building extensively and although there is abundant information, much of it is too esoteric or complicated for the casual learner. Athena strikes a rich balance in Homes that Heal, providing technical information and guidance in an easy to understand and informative way. As a professional in this industry, I can refer to her book over and over again for reference and clarification and as a educator by default, I know that our customers can walk away with one book that gets them started in the right direction. So, whether you are doing one room in your home or buiding from scratch, Homes that Heal is the place to start."
2,Not good for design or remodel,"I would not recommend this book for anyone that is looking for practical ways to redesign or remodel. I feel the author is not really in touch with the real world of design. I did not find this book helpful on how to really ""get things done."" I would suggest finding a book written by someone who has more experience in the design world."
5,a replacement for video games,A wonderful way to entice children of all ages and prove that reading books can be fun. Let's replace video games!
5,Classic,"I used to love Waldo books when I was a kid, I purchased this for my nephew and he always has me sit with him to look through it. He thinks it's awesome, so I'm happy with it."
4,Nice little bookshelf system,"This little system has clean lines and very good sound for its size and cost. The speakers are well balanced and have a warm and comfortable midrange that makes the system easy on the ears. I use the system with a computer and a Dell 2405 FPW monitor. The composite video output is very sharp and together the two make for a nice desktop entertainment system. The price is right and the build quality is high. Audiophiles might find the power lacking, but for a desktop entertainment system the Philips MCD708 is a good choice."
3,The Duke on Command,"The Duke himself is in this movie about Marine pilots in the South Pacific during World War II. Since this movie was made in the fifties, there is not a lot of gore and violence. The fight scenes you see are mostly actual footage from aerial combats during WWII.The movie centers around two things. First, it shows the usage of military planes providing close ground support. Repeatedly, everyone mentions it can't be done, but the Duke and his group continue to show that it is viable. Second, we see the agonies of command.John Wayne is a major who is not always liked by his subordinates. He is a career military man trying to keep his team, mostly young college men, alive by enforcing discipline. He drives them relentlessly as the executive officer tries to ease up on them. By the end of the movie, the executive officer gets an explanation on why it is necessary for commanders to push their men.For military film buffs or John Wayne fans, I would highly recommend seeing this movie."
5,Double Feature: They Were Expendable / Flying Leathernecks,"Two of the most entertaining war films packaged into one case. Hard to go wrong with this. The film quality is clear, no issues with sound or visual. If you enjoy war films with a good storyline, ineresting characters and well-directed/acted, then I strongly suggest this double feature package."
5,John Wayne does it right on the sea and in the air,"""They Were Expendable"" is a true story about the first real action of PT boats in the second world war, as it occurred in the Phillipines in the early months of 1942. ""The Fleet the Gods Forgot"" by Winslow includes an account of Torpedo Boat Squadron 3 which closely matches the movie, and includes additional accounts of heroic action by the men who served in the squadron.""Flying Leathernecks"" is an incredible piece of history, showing F6F Hellcat fighters and F4U Corsair fighters in air operations in the Pacific and on Essex class aircraft carriers. If you enjoy seeing these historic ships and planes in real color, you should also consider ""Dive Bomber"" with Fred McMurray which shows air operations in 1941 on the USS Enterprise (CV-5).These are great movies for any 2nd world war history buff."
3,Good WW!! aerial picture,"If you like John Wayne you have to like this picture. He plays the typical tough leader that has to teach his second in command, Robert Ryan, HOW to command. -As Wayne was a die-hard consertive and Ryan a card carrying member of the ACLU, I wonder how they got along. They never again appeared in a film togeather."
4,PT BOAT CREWS,Great epic of our fathers fight for our freedom.We should all appreciate this vanishing breed of Americans.Semper-FiUSMC 1966-1973
2,Children watch,"Would prefer the standard adjustable strap than the ""button"" strap. Also not easy to read time for a beginner."
1,Beware of fradulent merchant.,"What I wanted was EXACTLY what the title stated: Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 SP2B for System Builders - 1 PackWhat I got was an OEM copy of a Dell restore CD which will only work on Dell computers.What the real problem was that I asked the seller a question: Is this a Microsoft CD or some OEM (like Dell) restore CD? and got no response for three days.After further research into the product description I noticed the product/model # :M93-00294. Since this is what I wanted, I ordered it.When I got the Dell restore CD, I was furious. I sent it back, and even though advantechsolutions gave me a full refund, He had no explaination as to why the wrong product was sent or why no one responded to my question. I still had to expend return shipping charges. Amazon needs to police their merchants better."
1,Not What is Advertised,I took a chance and went by the description and model number of the product that was advertised. After I placed the order I sent a email to the seller just to make sure I would be getting what was advertised. Well it seems this is a restore cd. This is not what is advertised! The seller said in his email to me that it stated this was a restore cd in the advertisement. Know where could I find this. I hope the seller will make things right and take this product back and send me what is advertised on Amazon. I will follow up when everything is sorted out. For now I suggest to avoid this seller at all costs. They advertise one thing and send another.
2,Old,It may have been good in it's day but was too old for my version of Windows...I'm running Windows XP Professional Edition and got a pop-up alert that the version I was running was newer that the one I was trying to install.
3,"Fun, but didn't do the trick for me...","Always fun to play with new toys, and although this felt quite nice, it never threw me over the edge, sadly."
2,great for begginers.,this product is great for beginners trying something new. its not very intense and only lasts 20 minutes. it is probably better for him than her.
5,A must-have for OA Lodge Vigil Committee,"This is the source material for the Lenape section in the back Order of the Arrow Handbook. This book is handy because it is useful not only Lenape to English, but also English to Lenape. This book in hardcover is very rare so if you get the chance, I recommend you purchase a copy. I purchased my first copy at the 1986 National Order of the Arrow Conference at Colorado State University and have used it ever since helping my lodge's Vigil Committee select names for new candidates. We choose the name in English and then translate it into Lenape. This allows us to choose names that are much more personal to the candidate."
2,Fountain of one,"Really by seeing the picture I assumed that the order was for all the items shown in the photo. The delivery was fast, but I feel the amount of items should be better specified."
3,Interesting read.,"Interesting book, but not up to the quality of the writings of Forester, O'brian or Kent. The other books in this series are equal in all aspects."
5,Summer time fun!,What a great way to add to your summer picnics. Very colorful so all can have their very own set of corn cob holders. Easy to hold!
5,"Great hikes, so close, so many",I knew there were a lot of parks around the cities but this book takes each one with a good trail system and shares the walk with the reader...easy to follow and easy to review to decide which hikes to take. Also like the fact that the author is a naturalist and shares facts and tidbits about the things found along the hike. This is a good birthday or Christmas gift for anyone who is even a casual hiker.
5,Something for Everyone,"This book is great for visitors to the Twin Cities or long-time residents. Excellent directions and maps and useful and accurate information about the difficulty of the trail, trail length and access, plus special elements of interest. The book reads as though Tom is right there with you. One item that I find especially unique is that this book also presents trails that are accessible to people in wheelchairs or who have physical limitations that would preclude them from enjoying most areas of hiking and yet they can still get the feeling of being in the woods and a chance to enjoy the great outdoors and there are also hikes for the more experienced hiker. Excellent variety of hiking trails for all, plus a few areas that I did not know about and I live in the Twin Cities! Would make an excellent gift!"
5,Love This Book,I love this book. It has a variety of good hiking spots in the metro for various ages and activity levels. Accurate trail maps. Good book to find hikes with young kids.
5,Change the world in one generation!,"This book is inspiring! If I ever have a day when I am full of despair for the state of the world, I will pick up Zoe Weil's book! Her optimism for a future full of wise decision makers is contagious. Weil describes people who are making a difference and offers her common sense method for teaching people about current issues. The book is clearly written, is full of ideas for curriculum implementation, and offers a large list of resources.Weil points out that humane education is about providing accurate information and offering positive choices. It does not tell people what to think. Her activities promote critical thinking, instill reverence, and are fun. If every educator had this book, we would change the world in a generation!"
2,READ THIS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE!,"As a fan of Reboot I was thrilled that I might see the entire collection. Although DVD's are sold as Volumes they only contain a few episodes. Not near enough to enjoy the true richness of the series. When I purchased ALL 4 volumes some even purported to be ""seasons"" I expected to get just that. Not 4 selected epsiodes from each year. I would have GLADLY paid more to actually get what I wanted..."
2,very disapointing,"While I'm a great fan of reboot, my second favorite show growing up (transformers was my first), this is outrageous, to charge this sort of price for four or five episodes, and they didn't even release season 1 or 2, I would gladly pay the price there asking if it was the full season, but this isn't worth it."
5,Double Click For fun,Now What Can I say that the amazon reveiwer didn't besides This is one of the best companies to do animation and that It's the best dvd I own. Lets See I cna't wait for beast wars on dvd and I am so glad that There are two reboot moives now. If you think expostion is boring then you shouldn't be reveiwing things by the way.
2,No way! Great title but the book does not deliver!,"A few OK idea (nothing really new), but forget the all night stuff"
1,might work for some men,"I found that the techniques can work to some extend, but you will have to practice for a long time, before you get the results. There are faster ways to learn to make love all night long..."
2,MUCH TO DO ABOUT NOTHING,Not much new here...This male multiple orgasm gimick must be for selling the book... save your money and enjoy the one orgasm you get!
2,How to make love all night and drive a woman wild,It was from a knowledgable author. Still reading it.
3,Your mileage will vary,"I gave this book and its techniques a really good try, had fun along the way, but ultimately didn't succeed.I did all the exercises, I practiced assiduously for about two months, I read the book carefully cover-to-cover at least twice. I had many enjoyable sessions along the way, and the very idea of striving for multiples turns me on. But try as might, I couldn't achieve multiple climaxes.I first tried Matak Chia's techniques, which are similar but have a disturbingly quasi-religious aspect.Both Keesling and Chia have this in common: they imply that if you fail, it's because you didn't try hard enough, didn't read carefully enough, etc. I've not met anyone who succeeded (how would I?) and if I did, how could I tell if they were truthful?I'd still recommend the book for the turn-on and the sensitizing exercises. Just approach with open eyes."
3,A good starting point,"This book isn't the final word on male multiple O's but it teaches some good basic techniques that work well and can be built upon. (I'm up to 4 and gradually climbing... Who says men peak at 18? ) Warning: The techniques take time and hard work to perfect; however, the payoffs are ""climactic""!"
3,A good start...,"This book does include all the basics you need to know, but I found the actual amount of usefull content a bit thin. It does include excercises in order to be sucessfull with this. It does not include much in deeper detail of the subject. Rather, its modivational and hand-holding instead. I found it more of a starting point for research than a complete guide. Its no tantra, but it does have what you need to know to do it with a minimal of fuss. So, its worth the read if this is all new to you."
3,One woman's point of view,"Even though I found some useful information in this book, it falls into the category of making men responsible for female orgasm. If we women don't have a lover that's as great as this book tries to make him, then we are out of luck. It seems we aren't supposed to have orgasms if our boyfriends aren't proficient lovers. Men don't have to put up with that. They can have orgasms no matter how lousy a lay their partner.I would recommend instead for guys, and their girlfriends, Five Minutes to Orgasm Every Time You Make Love. This book empowers women. Some men won't like that, but I bet most men will like being de-stressed for a while. Not all women want to go all night all the time. Sometimes she wants to have her orgasm, go to sleep and face a busy day the next day just like you."
4,Practice Might Make Perfect,"I'm only about half way through the book. I bought it on a whim, but Barbara makes the possibility of a Multiple Male Orgasm seem within our grasp (ha ha). The book is fun, with plenty of puns and innuendo. I would recommend it to both males and females. Let me know if you have any questions or have some success to share. I'll be back with an update"
2,Boring,"Boring and overwritten. The data could have been printed in half the pages if the author hadn't spent so many words on herself and her opinions. There are some exercises she spells out that are pretty much common sense and you might figure out for yourself if you thought about it. Basically, no ""Big New Secrets"" here, just what she's told her clients to do."
2,Clench WHAT? Definitely requires a Personal Trainer,"Eh..this book was ok. interesting in the fact that it was written by a woman who is a ""professional sex surrogate"". if that's not a euphimism, I don't know what is.written from a female perspective, it may seem to be an easy thing to do as she suggests, and some of her male 'colleagues' are reported to be doing these tightening maneuvers, however, just as some people may be able to roll their R's, their tongues, or cross their eyes, others simply cannot, for whatever reason.I just think a little more disclosure would be prudent to avoid returns - :D"
4,It's a definite pleaser,This book is everything you both should know and do to make it a memorable night!!!
1,boring,Nothing new that I have not read in any men's magazine. Good thing I bought it at a book sale for $.95 or I would really be disappointed.
4,This book helped me to bring her to the Edge of our World !,"Techniques provided in this text, along with a deep desire to truly satisfy your partner, will bring her to the point of sexual arousal that she never thought existed. After sharing some of this newfound knowledge upon her, she exclaimed that lovemaking (with me)would never be the same again. She was so grateful to be treated like a sexual godess. A must read for any couple wishing to make their lives together truly complete."
5,WOW...Brain-Author endorses book...,"In writing ""The Care and Feeding of Your Brain"" I purchased this book and also dug up some research saying that PC muscle exercises did not work in facilitating orgasm. My partner and I worked on the exercises anyway, mainly out of curiosity. It works despite what the academics say...maybe they were just too starchy-white-coated and stodgy to get results themselves. Seriously though, I think the specific method of accomplishing these exercises is the key that makes them different from simple ""Keegil"" exercises that were studied unsuccessfully. All the best to Dr. Keesling for finding what works...Kenneth Giuffre MD, author, ""The Care and Feeding of Your Brain"" (great companion book for finding things to optimize your brain while doing her prescribed exercises)."
4,It helped,It has helped a little. But I am not at olympian level yet. It really takes a lot of effort. But the exercises are a great time distractor. If anything it definetly has prevented any pre-mature ejaculation. But I am not at the level I would like to be yet.
3,Movie is good - DVD is bare-bones,"This is a gritty movie about one girl's experience in the Berlin underage prostitution/drug scene of the 70's. This is no glamorized Hollywood movie with mid-twenty year old actors as teens.This is a depressing movie, although ultimately it has a good ending, at least for Christiane.I read the 5-star book years and years ago, and after buying the DVD a few months back, I wanted to re-read the book as it has much more detail, and more cycles of getting clean and relapsing than shown in the movie. The book is out of print (natch!), but it is worth checking out used-book stores for it.The DVD has no extras at all, and as noted by others, no subtitles - you get it in original German, or second-rate dubbed English. I watch it both ways - German for the emotion, English for understanding.Still, highly recommended for a change from the Hollywood usual. Much David Bowie in the soundtrack."
2,"Heroin, anyone?","This movie depicts the ease with which so many people have fallen prey to heroin. Set in Germany in the '70's, it has a very gritty, urban feel to it and the acting is surprising good. It provides something of a historical perspective for film buffs whose library includes ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" and ""Panic in Needle Park."""
5,A Masterpiece,"It amazes me that this film isn't more widely known. It's nothing short of perfection--stellar acting, a brilliant ""Berlin Era"" soundtrack by David Bowie & gritty cinematography that perfectly captures the subject, the city and the time period. With the exception of a couple of Fassbinder films, no other film captures the aesthetic and essence of 1970s Berlin better.This is also one of the most honest portrayals of drug abuse that I've ever seen put to celluloid. The director doesn't shy away from or attempt to glamorize the horrors of heroin withdrawal and addiction (and all the ugly things that come along with it), but he also doesn't demonize all drugs or the atmosphere of teenage hedonism that leads to drug experimentation either. It's a very even-handed, honest film, which not many ""drug films"" are.Amazing film; definitely check this one out."
5,looking for term definitions,"""The Book of Forms"" is an excellent resource for the study and understanding of poetic forms. Turco presents an abundance of information that will enable the aspiring poet to look beyond craftsmanship. The book is loaded with examples of the artistic possibilities of poetry as sonic and visual as well as written."
5,Excellent reference book!,"This book is such a great reference! It's an excellent guide for writing the old fashioned, classical forms of poetry: sonnets, sestinas, etc, etc. It includes all kinds of poetry formats that I hadn't even heard of-- it's very thorough. For each style of poetry, you get the rhyme pattern, an example poem, and a little bit of history about it.This isn't the kind of book you would read cover to cover like a novel or anything, but it's a very valuable reference. I'm an English major with a creative writing emphasis, and I have had a great time working with this book!"
1,garbage,"dont fall for the 5 star reviews. they are all in perfect punctuation and thank pearl jr like she is a god, obviously fakes. i watched 5 min of this on netflix then decided to read the reviews. they all gave 1 star because they couldnt give 0"
1,Utter and Complete Crap,"I can give this a -1 star I would. I was interested so I rented this video on Netflix. It was a waste of time and was such a silly ""documentary"" that was done on the cheap. Watching this film with its far-reaching theories and cheap camera work reminded me of a couple of children doing this film for an English class. First off the presenter asserted that Michael Jackson was alive and his death was faked but then again she goes back on her own information and tries to make conspiracy on how he died. Wait...I thought you said he was alive and now you are stating he's dead but not the way the many reports have stated? I don't know WHO or WHY anyone gave this 4 or 5 stars but I can guess it was the fools who created this crap."
4,Alive or dead?,"I bought this video because I wanted to know if Michael Jackson was alive or dead. I needed to know it! I watched the video and... I watched the video again, and again and again. I was shocked by all these awesome informations. Now, 99% of me think he's alive, and this DVD helped this number to grow :) (Sorry if my enlgish isn't well....)"
3,Superficiality...,I think this video is only an advertizement for her book . Very superficial . Like a traileroff a movie .
3,Wow,"This DVD is beautiful, loved it.Even if I do not believe very much in Michael's faked death.Well, we will see!Ok, bye.Julia"
1,The real hoax,"The real hoax is all the 5 star even 3 star customer reviews. They are clearly members of Pear Jr.'s production team or perhaps pathetically Pearl Jr. herself. This is horrible horrible documentary. My first year project at film school was edited better than this. It is tough to say but I don't think I have seen worse student films than that. Pearl jr. is clearly an idiot. All these 5 star reviews found Pearls arguments compelling but fail to mention even one convincing argument, probably because there are none to be found. At best this documentary proves that Michael Jackson was not planning on dying. What a shock! Reminds me of everyone else in this flippin world. I remember when my grandmother told me she wanted to come visit me next summer, but then she died. Or did she? This ""Doc"" also proves that a Michael Jackson fan will do anything to make a fool of themselves."
2,Hmm,"There are some interesting points in this movie, but they are over shadowed by the distracting narration and morbid music. Oh, and the complete lack of factual basis.A few good parts that make you go ""Hmm..."". Maybe there was something wierd going on with his death, or the body. But, mostly it's alot of stretching and quotes taken out of context. Worth watching, if only to confirm the fact that Michael Jackson is dead."
3,Left Wondering/Pearl JR,"I respect pearl Jr as a hoax investigator, and look up to her as one. But most of the things shown on the dvd was things I already made videos about on youtube since this hoax began on june 25, 2009. I wish the dvd had more depth to it. I know she could have found things that I couldn't but chose the most obvious things to put onto the dvd with her commentating on them. Much respect to her but I hope she will do a second dvd with different clues to this hoax."
1,Not the best Lonely Planet for travelling in the US,"I took several Lonely Planet guide books with me on a 6-week drive across the US, and I'm very glad I did. The *regional* volumes (Lonely Planet Southwest, Lonely Planet Deep South, and Lonely Planet California & Nevada in particular) pointed me to some interesting little spots that I never would have found on my own or with a more traditional guidebook -- small-town festivals, outstanding small museums, breathtaking spots in national parks that the tour buses don't visit, fun alterative driving routes through the mountains.I also brought along this book, thinking it would be useful for the areas not covered in my other books. It wasn't. The entries for each city are so short that all it really offers is a brief history, the major tourist attractions and a couple of (often outdated) hotel/restaurant recommendatations.I highly recommend the regional Lonely Planet guidebooks for US travel, but don't bother buying this one."
4,New edition is better,I just wanted to point out that most of these poor reviews are based on the first edition. The new one is obviously more up to date and is more polished than the last edition.
2,VERY LITTLE IMPROVEMENT OVER THE LAST EDITION,"As somebody who has a good knowledge of U.S. Geography (and History), I will not condemn this book too much. However, I will not rate it high. Its ""updated information"" is more or less superficial. Except for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, there is no grounded addition or remarkable improvement over the last edition. I was disappointed to observe that most other updatable facts and figures remained unchanged. Anyone who already has the previous edition shouldn't consider buying this one. Donate the dough to charity; or do something else with it. 'September 11' is the only big deal here!"
5,Required gift for any wedding,"Second only to Work is Hell, this book depicts all important aspects of any relationship in an easy-to-read format. For those who are not already aware, the Life in Hell series is a precurser to Goening's biggest hit, The Simpsons, and is, in my opinion, his best comic. I personally buy this book for every wedding I am most unfortunate to attend. I'm not sure how well it is received as the thank-you notes rarely mention the book. I would nevertheless recommend it as required reading for anyone thinking about making the big leap."
2,love is hell,"it's a cartoon, the 22 stages of heartbreak.... love having it to map my progress, till I'm ""ready for more abuse"""
1,I Beg To Disagree,"I ordered the Davis/Elgar on the basis of the reviews posted here, but I'm sorry to say that this recording was a major disappointment. I love the work and own recordings by Slatkin, Boult, and Mackerras. As a performance the Davis certainly impresses, but the recording quality of my copy does not reflect the praise showered by other reviewers of this CD. In the first movement the left channel has an intermittent rasp in the strings that sounds like some sort of acoustical problem with the recording venue. The Adagio is marred by audible conversations, I assume from the audience, and the finale is punctuated by what sound like noisemakers from the hall. I'd buy a studio recording by this ensemble, but I cannot recommend the recording I received. Sorry."
3,"She worked hard, loved animals and mound her business","That's the epitaph 90+ year old Maude Coggin wrote for herself. She was a true Moose County original, a courageous old gal who worked the land herself and fed old stray dogs. It's her death that is the catalyst for the action in this tale, and frankly, I missed her. She was a breath of fresh air.Polly Duncan, Arch Riker, a Goodwinter or two, Weatherby Goode -- all the Moose County regulars are here. As of course are Koko and Yum-Yum, this time they're fascinated by things with wings. Qwill takes part in a town spelling bee. It's all charming, but all pretty predictable. Except for the charming, eccentric Maude. I wish we'd been able to spend more time with her before she passed."
4,"Pretty Good, But Not Quite as Good","I am a big fan of the Cat Who mystery series. The Cat Who Sang For the Birds was the first new book in the series to come out after I had begun reading the series. Therefore, it was all rather fresh to me, and I found both the book and the style quite interesting. I think part of what makes this series so great is that it's not so much murder mystery as a nice, well-connected tale. The Pennant Race (spelling bee) is a nice extra, and so are some of Qwill's pursuits. On further reading of the book, after reading some of the others, I find that it could be more interesting and exciting. The humor however is there, and so are the cats! Let the cats live on forever!"
2,"Disappointing Introduction to ""The Cat Who"" Books","This is my first ""Cat Who"" book, and I must say I was disappointed. There didn't seem to be much of a plot and there was no really no character build-up. There was no remorse over the 'Butterfly Girl' because we never really got to know her and the rogue boyfriend didn't seem to fit with any of the rest of the book. The cats were mentioned very little and the 'psychic' powers of Koko - while interesting - were more than implausible with the 'WEST' deductions.All-in-All it was an ""I must finish this book because I paid for it."" experience. Based on the comments of other reviewers - this was not Braun's best - So I may still give one of the earlier books a try."
2,The Cat Who Sang For The Birds has hit a wrong note.,"This current book of MS Braun's is different from her past works. This endeavor has a different feel to it. There is a dark and brooding mood. Gone are the older characters that imparted the charming small town feeling. The bantering between Polly and Quill is missing, as are the cats. Though they do make an appreance, most of the cat in The CAT Who.. is absent. Gone also, is the humor. If you had to skip one book in the series, this would be the one. It does not continue the story line in the old familary way. Reread one of the first three books, and wait for the next one."
1,"Order for ""Cat Who....."" gift items","AMAZON WEB PAGE SCREW-UPI tried 3 times to have a gift sent and failed. Each time after entering the name and address of the gift receipent in the SHIP TO column the order web page ""auto corrected"" the shipping address to the billing address. FRUSTRATING! The 'gift' is being sent to me. I'll now have to mail it to the intended gift receiver--extra work, extra cost, delayed Christmas present, extra time for failed attempts. I have been pleased with Amazon service in the past. Not the time, AMAZON FAILED!!!"
1,NOT ON OF BRAUNS BEST,I've read some of the Braun series cat books and this one wasn't one of my favorites. It was boring with no plot and it did mention very little about the Butterfly Girl or who she is. The story didn't make any sense at all. I couldn't get into this one. I read it but was disappointed in it. I'm lucky that I only paid $1 for it towards charity.
1,THIS BOOK WAS A DULL MYSTERY WITH ALMOST NO PLOT,I WOULD HAVE RATHER READ THE DICTIONARY THIS WAS A DULL UNCREATIVE BOOK WITH ALMOST NO PLOT AND NO POINT!
4,"Okay, but Braun has been better.","I have read the majority of cat who books and enjoyed everyone I read. Sang for the Birds however tends to drift from Braun's style. Has a friend of mine said, ""It's a little too soupy."" Also the best part of the book is the last five-ten pages where everything is revealed. Koko and YumYum however are still the best detectives."
3,Not her strongest,"This look into the continuing saga of qwill and kok left a taste like cotton candy, glad it's there, but it melts away real fast. A rambling series of subplots, with the most effective and continuous being the the 'Spell Game' makes the book disjoint and adds to a feeling of being put together from a computer based story plot program. Where are the CATS? Where are the loveable and curious Moose County folks. What purpose did butterflies, art center, and the rest of the _dressings_ really serve. Yes, I'll continue to read them, and buy them, but this was made me go baclk and read the first three again, just to remember how good Braun can really be."
4,"""The Cat Who Sang For The Birds"" is less enthusiastic.","In previous Cat Who's..., Lillian Jackson Braun has shown a wonderful talent for combining the mystery and ""pet lover"" them together, making one of the best known series. However, ""The Cat Who Sang For The Birds"" is less enthusiastic, dealing more with Qwilleran (the cats' owner)'s life than with the mysteries that Koko and Yum Yum (the cats) solve. Although the book did hold my attention, I feel that it could of been more of a mystery. But, I still say: Vive the cats!"
2,A trudge through Moose County,"It has been a long time since I last read a ""Cat Who"" book, but I seem to recall them being more interesting than this one. It is difficult to tell the backdrop from the foreground of the story, the backdrop of Moose county occupies much more time than the foreground, though it is interwoven. Qwill seems to follow the mystery much more than participate in it and the background characters have much more appeal than those intimately involved with the mystery, the primary of which we only meet briefly or know of through the accounts of others. This makes it difficult to really care about their fate, and thus the story."
1,Very poor image/color quality,"The image/color quality was very poor, unlike other sports DVD I have purchased. The colors looked washed out and the images were not sharp. Amazon replaced it, but got same quality of product as the first one. I have written Amazon, Rose Bowl, and ESPN. Amazon was the only one, concerned enough to reply. For my money it was not worth the price, very disappointed."
1,Looks like a DVD from a VHS tape!,"Suggestion to ESPN or whoever produced this very low quality DVD: if this is the best you can do, don't do it. For ESPN to make money off this low quality DVD says a lot about what they think of consumers. At least I got it at a low price from Target on-line. Now they have taken it down from their website. They were probably embarresed to have their name associated with something that looks like it was copied from a VHS tape to DVD. Yes the quality is that bad. I would recommend that Amazon do the right thing and not offer this inferior quality product on their website. Somebody needs to take a stand."
1,"Great game, horrible DVD","Like the others have said, an awful production of the standard-definition broadcast. I'm not expecting Blu-Ray true high-def obviously, but they could have at least down-sampled the HD broadcast to anamorphic widescreen and with a better compression algorithm. It looks like an amateur YouTube production made with Windows Movie Maker. Oh, and you CAN play the entire game, it's just not obvious how: when you get to the menu screen, instead of selecting a quarter, press the ""menu"" button on your remote instead. I had to decompile the UOPS script to discover that, since I could see Title 1 on the disc but couldn't figure out how to play it."
1,Terrible. Do Not Buy.,"The quality of this DVD is truly awful. It is grainy and the colors are washed out. ESPN must have hired a crew of blindfolded monkeys to produce this one. The other BCS game DVDs I own look very good and professionally produced. Looks like someone videotaped the game off a standard definition broadcast, and burned it with a bad quality DVD burner. I did not even get though a whole quarter, so I can't comment on being unable to watch the whole game. Like the review before mine, I thankfully have a DVR copy that I will burn myself. DO NOT PURCHASE. Excellent game, atrocious DVD. I tried to give this 0 stars, but Amazon won't publish without a star."
4,Good,"Good film but I was expecting for an other kind of documentary, I mean, more general about energies and not so particular as it is presented."
4,A treasure that everyone can enjoy!,I'm a college student studing to be an Elementary teacher. I had the oppotuninty to read Dear Socks and Dear Buddy book. It was a delight and I'm very excited to add this to my collection of childrens books!
1,Needs An Update,"It's too bad the book doesn't have an update about how Hillary, after using Socks as a prop, gave the cat away when she left the White House because it became too ""inconvenient"".What a warm and loving woman..."
4,"Quirky, fun, weird, experimental... and nice","'Cookie Puss' is an embryonic view of what would later become one of the greatest rap groups of all time. All of the tracks are highly experimental, but you can clearly see the creative patterns of sampling and crazy lyrics that the band is developing."
2,flimsy,"The book is small, not good for reading to a whole class. The moveable parts are too flimsy for a child to handle."
4,It helps!,"I got this book for our 2 yr old who hates to brush her teeth. It helped us for about a solid month, and now she's back to hating her teeth being brushed... but it at least helped a little while!The book has pop ups with movable tooth brushes and floss to help the kids interact. Great idea, but it's not very durable. After about a month the book is still usable, but it's pretty worn in already."
5,Cool book,Excellent book but was sad that the brushes tore out too easily. My son is 2 yrs old tho & doesn't stand up to his torture. He loves the book tho & like to brush the animal's teeth & sometimes uses the book's brush for his...
4,Gentle hands needed,"I purchased this to help motivate my 2yr 2mo daughter to let us brush her teeth. She was only chewing her brush and not allowing us to brush appropriately. After reading other reviews I thought why not? I have tried many other things such as searching utube videos of cartoon toothbrushing, letting her brush my teeth and taking turns,and allowing her to brush her toy animals' teeth. She liked moving the cardboard brushes but it was not easy for her to do so since she doesn't quite know how to read the arrows on the pull handles and the pages may require some stabalization by an adult. She has torn a little of the book by pulling in the wrong direction or pulling with too much force. On the flossing page, more damage was done by flossing the shark too hard. The book is entertaing but is not made to last which is why it is not getting 5 stars. It was a bit pricy for something that got damaged so quickly. Cute illustrations though."
5,E5 (SCL5) review plus sleeve recommendation,"Shure E5 IEMs are your best choice if you are a professional musician or an audiophile looking for powerful musical detail. Please be aware that the Shure E5 has been replaced by the SCL5; they are both professional grade. Just make sure you don't overpay based on model numbers...If you get a pair of these IEMs, I hope you are lucky enough to find a good fit with any of the adapters (sleeves) provided by Shure. I tried them all and found them to be too short to allow the SCL5 to have a good seal, which is critical. The Shure Triple Flange sleeves are your best bet. Don't get discouraged by the pair included in your packaging; it is smaller in diameter than the Shure EA306 Triple Flange Sleeves. Make sure you order that specific model and get ready to enjoy music like you never have before.If your ear canal is small, you may get by with smaller adapters. I'd just wonder how you manage to fit an SCL5 in small ears. Those things are BIG!Enjoy!"
1,Very misleading!,"No preview that I could find. Thought I was renting a montage of great screen bits not really dumb skits by two guys as they attempt to narrate/introduce some of the worse stooge performances I have ever TRIED to sit through! They are nowhere close to the style of the comedy bit recaps found in the recent stooges movie released in 2012, (my personal style taste) so, if you are looking for the truly funny skits, I don't believe you'll find them here...unless they are after the first 20 minutes or so, 'cause that is all I could take!Please don't be offended by my review, just trying to clarify for others. I'm sure somone out there will agree with this movie and that's fine. ;)"
1,Re-issue of the inferior color intros to the 1965 cartoons.,"This is FAR from their greatest, it is their 1965 re-performance of their classic routines. Moe & Larry are much older and Curly has been replaced by Curly-Joe, their comedy pacing is off and slow. Also why buy these 16mm prints when you can get the original uncut versions on the cartoon releases?The Three Stooges - Cartoon Classics, Vol. 1The Three Stooges: Cartoon Classics, Vol. 2Watching this will only make you yearn for the original classic performances of the 1930's & 1940's."
5,Fantastic Resource for Voice Teachers,"I have been a private voice and piano teacher for 7 years now and just recently read this book. I wish I had read it when I first began teaching privately. Joan Frey Boytim gives so many suggestions about studio policies, appropriate repertoire, warm-up routines, etc. Its a fantastic resource and I highly recommend it!Sincerely,Lisa Kelly-Willis"
2,This book could be better.,"Despite liking this book, I must state that there are some useful things I think it should have but it does not.No subject index in the end of the book. I constantly find myself having too much trouble looking for some specific topic in this book. There should be a name index also, for example, Boytim mentions a Dame Joan Sutherland anecdote, but once the book is closed, you'll have to search the entire book for that again. With a name index, that wouldn't happen.No bibliography. Now this is a shame. No other comments.Now the absence of these important features, which any good book will have, is a big disadvantage. Anyway, this will happen to any/every Hal Leonard book.This book could be better. Hal Leonard books could be better."
3,A VERY general guide to running a voice studio,"Generally, this is a good ""starter book"" for anyone wanting to open a Voice Studio. It is however, target marketed to the average business novice.. who has very little business skills. If you are already operating a studio, and have done so for quite a while, then i would not suggest it. Furthermore, it only addresses Classical/Oratorio/Art song repertiore. No additional focus on contemporary music or contemporary musical theatre (which is a LARGE portion of singing students today.) Still, if you are a graduate starting out - looking for basic, yet good ideas... this is a good book to start. Still, beautifully written and Joan's chapter on 'vocal techniques' is worth buying the book - for that chapter alone."
2,Poor drawings,Poor quality of both drawings and the book material itself...Maybe if the book had more paper quality it could be bettter appreciated...
3,I was the pilot of a suicide submarine and lived to tell,"Fascinating read. This is the war diary of a suicide submarine (Kaiten) in World war two. The Kaiten was a submarine Kamiaze weapon. Essentially a torpedo with cockpit. The operator would ride the torpedo right into the side of the victim ship. While the book is a narrative of training, it is also an insight into the mind of race of people who had no problem getting volunteers to sacrifice their life for their country. I also recommend Iron Coffins by Herbert Werner for the war diary of a German submariner"
4,Combines fantasy and realism,"I liked this book because I grew up in Southern California and could relate to the variety of characters. My favorite character of course was Weetzie, who was a free spirit that did not let others do her thinking for her."
4,Great view of the alternative family,"The first of the Weetiz Bat series is a cut above the other volumes, perhaps because of the empesis on the redefinition of the family. The fairy tale quality of the book serves as a good intoduction to the concepts of Magical Realism for those readers unfamiliar with the technique. A quick read, I could recomend this to any one interested in Young Adult fiction, or just a fun little book."
5,One of the most edgiest books to ever be written,"This book is a must for every teenager. While some are disguisted with the book (whether it is the writing style or content), it's filled with things that real people face in the real world every day. Teenagers shouldn't be kept in the dark just because some people think the content is too mature for them. The people who believe that are the same people who are afraid to face what's really going on with our world today. This book should be required reading for every teenager."
1,Utter stupidity... A meaningless piece of non-fiction,"I have never understood the Francesca Lia Block craze. Her writing is stitled and shallow, with extended metaphors and surrealistic descriptions to try and give it a greater sense of depth. Fact is it is silly trash, with no substance no soul, no heart. Oddly enough, I've read that originally the book was supposed to be an adult novel, but when no adult publisher would pick it up, Harper Row decided it could be a children's book. What a statement on YA literature, that it can have the rejects of the adult market. AND NOW... I've recently learned that Harpercollins is planning on re-releasing Weetzie Bat for it's 10th anniversary... It is going to be marketed as an adult title. EARLY WARNING, readers don't be fooled by whatever they slap on the cover this book is still the same trite piece of junk it always was!!"
2,"I've finally read ""Weetzie Bat""","and it was not what I expected it to be. I had heard really good things, read so many other YA novels, yet hadn't read Block's work. It is supposed to be so poetic, lyrical, and unusual.This was very weird. The best thing about it was it was only 87 pages..hope the next book is better."
1,did not like this,"I read this for a teacher-friend of mine as a favor to review YA books for 9th-10th grades. I had to tell the truth, I didn't like the writing style, the subject, the whole bit. I wouldn't want my children required to read this, unless they really wanted to (and even then I'd question their sanity!)"
2,Forced quirkiness - so why such the big deal?,"I'm not sure how I feel about this book. It's not that I disliked it, it's more that I couldn't understand why everyone else loves it so much. I did, however, love Block's portrait of Hollywood/Los Angeles (as I have loved it in her other books) and for that I think I find it the one character in the novel for whom I have any fondness whatsoever. Aside from the setting, I didn't think much of the characters or the whole fantasy/fairy tale angle. It came off more pretentious than whimsical and more forced than honestly weird or controversial. But, again, I didn't hate it. I just keep thinking of Joi Brozek's Sleeveless and how much more honest and compelling a hip young adult work of alternative reality than this could ever be. It's probably a bad sign when the reader has to remind herself that the author is trying her hand at quirky."
4,wish come true,"This is a stunning book. Part of me wanted there to be more of it because it was so good, but of course the sparseness of the prose is part of what makes this book so beautiful. There is no character like Weetzie anywhere else in literature, and you can't help but love her."
3,"Weird, but good","This book tells the story of a older teenager, Wezzie Bat and her friends lifes. It is wrotten in an interesting, lyric way, yet the writing can be confusing. I thought that the writing did not include enough detail. Some parents may be against this book, as it includes homosexuality, very-alternative families, and witch-craft references. However, I think this is a good book, but not nearly as good as other books by Block. I would reccomeend this to high school students, looking for a quick, short read. I wish this book had been longer and more developed."
4,Too short,"I finished this book in about an hour and a half. I really enjoyed it but it was WAY too short. I like almost all of Francesca's Weezie bat books, although they are all about the same length. I Reccomend ""Dangerous Angels"" to the NEW Francesca Lia Block Fans..because it has the whole series in one 500 page book. But Weeztie Bat itself, was really good. Read it!"
5,"Wonderfully written, uplifting, but not for the youngsters","To read this book for the first time is a pleasure. It is refreshing, breezy, and quite unique. You come to love the characters, who are so accepting and open minded and loving to everyone and everything around them. They see the beauty in life that the rest of us often miss. To read this book a second time is bliss. Block's writing is so amazing and beautiful and moving. As an educator, I would highly reccomend this book to upper HS students as well as ADULTS. Due to adult themes, however, youngsters should stay away, for they will surely miss the main theme of the book, which is that with acceptance, you have pure love and happiness."
2,"All Bat, No Cattle","Weetzie Bat is an exercise in fashion. And, as Coco Chanel reminded us over and over again, fashion passes, and style remains. Block sacrifices dialogue, character development, theme, and depth on the altar of modern and ""edgy"" subject matter and self-indulgently fashionable prose. What's left, once the sound and fury of her peculiar way of telling a story ends, is...not much. Not much in the way of character, not much in the way of characters acting believably, not much in the way of characters having voices...not much in general. Readers seeking a novel of style in the same fairy tale mold are urged to consider William Goldman's THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Believe me, I am in favor of edgy material: I loved TRAINSPOTTING and SMACK. But this? I shrug my shoulders and say, who cares?"
4,Kayla's Review,"The book Weetzie Bat by Francesca Lia Block is one of the best books i ever read! Even thought the book is very short there is a lot to it. There are many characters and a wonderful plot.In Weetzie Bat lives in Shangri L.A.. She makes a wish on a fairy for love for her and Dirk (her best friend). When the wish comes true, Dirk meets Duck and Weetzie meets My Secret Agent Lover Man! This book is of their adventures and their ups and downs in life. That is why i loved the book Weetzie Bat!"
5,=),Haven't read it yet. But I had a great service from you all. I'll keep looking for books here. Really recomended for internet shopping.
5,Batty for Weetzie Bat,"A quick, breezy read that made me feel like I'd just entered a parallel universe of kookiness, creativity, love and independence. The novella reads like a dream and I was instantly sucked into the glamour, fantasy, and surreal exploits of these loveable characters. There are heavy moments and serious issues tackled from death to abandonment and single parenting, but Block tackles it all with such love and optimism. Optimism can sometimes feel saccharine and forced, but she handles it so perfectly. I want to live in the world she has created!Weetzie Bat is definitely not for everyone, but an ideal read for dreamy romantic teens with a penchant for vintage threads, palm trees, apple pie and surfing. I could read this book again and again!"
4,An intriguing look at the psyche of a party girl in L.A.,"This was certainly an interesting approach. Fun to read, but the frankness ofsome of the content may shock some. I do recommend it, though."
4,Hollywood Cottage,"The setting in the book is a small ""Hollywood cottage"" left to Weetzie Bat and her friend Dirk from his deceased Grandma Fifi. It has ""fairy tale roof"" which looks like it has ""silly sand"" spilled on it. In the yard there are wild roses and lemon trees. Inside the cottage are two bedrooms; one rose colored and the other aqua. Plaster Jesus statues and butterfly ash trays scattered through out the cottage and paintings of clowns lining the walls. A true dream house in my perspective."
1,Way over-rated.,"Supposedly this book is transcendant, according to the quote from the New York Times on the back. I do agree that it's original, which is about the only good thing I can say about it.I think it's trying to be all stylistic and symbolic and thereby meaningful, but it just ends up as far too stupid and simplistic. I wasn't moved; I was annoyed."
1,This book is absolutely ridiculous.,"This is the most unrealistic young adult novel I have ever read. As a future English teacher, there is NO WAY I would ever recommend it to students. The characters are reckless and ridiculously naive, and Block does not present any realistic consequences for their bizarre actions. If any ""family"" can actually relate to this novel I feel very sorry for them, as Weetzie and her pals live in an insane world."
4,hold on a second,"The negative review of this book I have just read is I think very unfair. First off, I got the impression that Weetzie was out of her teens before her baby was conceived; second, this wasn't totally accepted by the characters of the novel - it just worked out later; third, the book also makes it very clear that life isn't perfect or bound ever to be perfect; fourth, this isn't exactly children's literature, and fifth, the household portrayed is strange but very warm loving. Real family values shouldn't be offended."
3,"good for the young reader, but not for the mature reader","The first time I read this, I was a sophmore in high school- I loved it (I also loved the sequels). Then I made the mistake of re-reading it when I was a bit older. The writing style annoyed me and it seemed to me as if the author was trying too hard to be original. My advice is read this book when you're young,it's a fun read, but eventually move on to better things and don't look back."
3,Bloody odd,"This controversial classic's odd style has often been mistaken for good writing. It isn't. Yet amazingly, we manage to feel real sympathy for some of these characters through the mess of fragmentary sentences in this ridiculous world of privilege and flippancy. Quite a feat."
3,Only for its intended audience,"The author has used an unorthodox writing style to help conjure up a strange, insular world of wealth and loneliness around the Los Angeles area. Much of her portrayal of this bizarre, insouciant living may be accurate, but I must confess that the writing style is offputting and really not very good. Despite this, Block somehow manages to create sympathy for her character, even though by many standards she participates in an immoral universe. Some teens might find it all appealing."
3,A pinch of magic and whimsy,"Weetzie Bat is a whimsical, quirky little tale full of a very specific brand of humor. There really is nothing out there like it. It's pretty much a modern day fairy tale set in L.A., with a mix of realism in there somewhere. The characters all live in this little fantasy bubble world where they either ignore problems until they go away or are solved by magic. But that is the magic of it. It's like an escape from everyday life into a magical land full of Hollywood glitz and glamour. It is a very short book and can be finished in less than an hour, and it really reads more like a short story than a novel. I think this is one of those books you will either be absolutely be over the moon for, or you just won't get it. I'm in the not really getting it camp. Yes, I liked it and thought it was quite cute, but it just didn't speak to me. Published over twenty years ago, it really is the epitome of the 80s and yet is still fun and relevant to today."
3,"thumb up for originality, thumb down for substance","My opinion is really divided on Block. On the one hand, I love her ultra-modern, dreamily yet manically poetic retelling of fairy tales (here is the genie with the three wishes, and the ""be careful what you wish for, you just might get it"" moral). On the other hand, her characters are flat and rather obnoxious (teenagers that try too hard to be weird, one of my biggest pet peeves as I was a naturally wierd kid), and I often feel like I'm drowning in urban, commercialistic images. Her prose and style is so manic that it just flies from one plot point to another (they get their wishes, they get their men, they get pregnant, the cry about the possibility of AIDs, they live happily ever after) that it feels like a teenager or child is telling the story wistfully. That's probably on purpose, but it just doesn't feel deep or meaningful or even worthwhile. She can modernize fairy tales into beautiful poetry, but I'm just not feeling it. Grade: B"
2,I didn't enjoy it..,"After seeing how many people liked this book on Amazon, I went to the library to check it out. From the beginning I thought it was weird, and it didn't get any better. I may have enjoyed this as an 8 year old, but this book was way too unrealistic for me. Any book where there's a genie in a bottle isn't something I want to read. I found this book a waste of time, annoying, and I didn't learn anything from it."
1,Really Unremarkable,"I'd heard lots of things about this book, that it was controversial, that it was great and a must read. So I decided to finally check it out. I read it in one sitting, but that wasn't because I was really interested in it. The writing style was very simple and done in a weird-to-be-weird way.The character of Weetzie Bat herself was likeable enough, but I just was left unimpressed by the story and the writing style. I won't be reading any more books in the series and I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone else either."
1,Trash.,"The author tries (but fails) to make up for the absolute nonsense that occurs in this book with verbose descriptions and imagery. There's no fluidity between events; everything happens ""just because the author says so"". There's no reason behind anything that happens in this book. In an attempt to make it seem like it actually has a message, one of the homosexual characters gets AIDS but that's about it."
1,TERRIBLE BOOK!,"I am 13 years old and i am in a mother-daughter book group. We all read it and thaught it was a terrible book! First of all, it was very innapropriate for teenagers to read and it was porrly written as well. I do not reccomend this book to anyone of any age."
4,Somewhat dated but colorful and interesting,"This colorful book incorporates the revival of Victorian designs with modern lifestyles. The primary purpose of this book appears to be how to add Victorian touches to pretty much any kind of home. It would be nice though, if this book was updated. The edition I have was printed in 1988."
4,Carnival Cruise Receipe Cook Book,"Book does not have all ship board current recepies, but has some older dishes that are interesting. Publisher should encourage writer to bring new book up to date."
5,beware you can't put it down!,Transport yourself back in time and ride shotgun to Sitting Bull. The detail in this book puts you right there. This book fell into my hands quite by chance and it had a profound impact on my view of history and the future.
5,A great history,A good history and a sad story as well. Chronicles what happened to the Native Americans through the life of one man.
2,Boring,"I found this book to be boring. Always interested in Native history, I found very little new information here."
5,FASCINATING,"For some unknown reason, I have always had a macabre fascinatination of the Thrid Reich. The psychological affects of a people sucked into a miasma of psychological deprivation and sheep like compliance to evil and downright ignorance. Mephisto also shows the lack of morality and what I suppose many Germans did in order to practice their art. Leni Reifenshal, is another example of Äny Means Possible,"" regarding the cirumstances."
1,Piece of garbage,"Brandauer can't even mimic the performance of Gustav Gruendgens, the original for ""Mephisto"" -- find the 1963 Gruendgens version of Goethe's Faust instead to see the actor of the century."
5,A must-have in anyone's schizophrenia library,"This book is timely, well-written, and a much-needed addition to the literature surrounding schizophrenia! The book highlights the important role of culture in shaping the incidence, course, and outcome experiences of this remarkable illness for people around the world."
5,A no-nonsense self-help guide,"Written by a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, What's A Parent To Do? Straight Talk on Drugs and Alcohol is a no-nonsense self-help guide to the extremely difficult task of preventing and dealing with epidemic drug abuse among children. Drawing heavily from the author's thirty years of experience treating substance-abusing young people and their families, What's A Parent To Do? covers how to protect one's children from drugs ranging from tobacco, alcohol and marijuana to acid, anabolic steroids, narcotics, psychostimulants, and other unsavory body- or mood-altering chemicals. Written in plain, non-judgement terms that focus primarily on helping families stay clean and healthy, What's A Parent To Do? is an absolute ""must-have"" for any parent or caretaker in today's unfortunately drug-saturated culture."
5,Great guide to understanding A Thousand Acres,"Susan Farrel has created an informative, easy to read, and scholarly guide to Smiley's ""A Thousand Acres."" Farrell both points out significant parallels with Shakespeare's King Lear and shows how the novel is a masterpiece in its own right. Her discussion does a marvelous job with three themes: appearance vs reality, environmental concerns, and gender politics. I recommend this book to readers who want to delve more deeply into the novel and to teachers of Smiley's wonderful book."
3,Jinxed,"I want to re-title this book, Jinxed, as that's how I feel each time I read it. I threw this book across the room after finishing it, but after a few days realize perhaps Jane was trying to tell us how important a mother is in our lives. I grew up on a farm, my mother had a grave illness, but survived and lived as a disabled person all her life. My father brought her home from hospital and he and extended family (but mostly my dad) dedicated theirselves to making a normal successful life for us. I want to write an answer to Jane's novel that tells the story of how adversity can bring out the best --not the worst -- in people."
4,Slip is a surprisingly good movie!,"Slip is a thoughtful story made with a low budget. Most of the acting is good, and I'd recommend this for someone who wants to try something new. The movie does a good job of mixing genres."
3,Great except needs a zipper and better clasp,"All is just fine, works well and feels good. However, the picture does not make it clear that there is no zipper closure and that the clasp is rather flimsy. I expected zipper for the price."
2,Very dissapointing,"We can call it a road atlas. However, in that field it fails. Poor, difficult to read mapping (like white roads on very light gray background), plenty of empty space, no small roads, no coordinates grid, no relief shading or coloring, only limited amount of interesting places marked on the maps etc. I bought it in hopes I could use it for Africa overland travels, but it is way too limited. Very nice concept but poor implementation. If you only want to drive through ""highways"" and are on budget then this atlas may be somewhat useful, but probably Michelin Africa regional maps 741, 745 and 746 at 1:4.000.000 scale are better investment. It contains some maps of national parks and town that may be useful. Southern part of this atlas is advertised as 1:1.000.000 scale, however that does not mean it has more details! Actual mapping in this atlas is done by South African company Map Studio and their other atlases are same low mapping standard as well."
1,YO USOULD OF SEEN THIS,WHAT A JOKE --PLEASE PUT CHIAHUAHU ON PROFILE SO I GET A 4 INCH BONES AND NOT 40 FOOT ONES ANOTHER JUNK ANIMAL WHATEVER --SOMESDAY I WILL GET IT RIGHT AND YOU WILL TOO --PUP PERONI SAUAGE HINT
3,Nice...but would keep looking,"While this is a good size, works well I should note it's only GREAT when full. The sides will go flat with just a small bag...and the entire unit will collapse."
5,Love it!!!,"I love this thing. I was so tired of stuff sliding around the back of my SUV. Problem solved now! I really like that you can open just 1, 2 or all 3 of the compartments. It holds a lot of stuff and the velcro on the bottom keeps it in place. Very well made. Woould recommend this to anyone."
3,OKay,I wish this basket was studier. The size is good and the easeof unfolding it when you are ready to use it is good. It does workfor holding things in place in a car.
5,Car Tote Organizer,Gave this to a friend for her new car. She loves it! We all need all the organization helps we can find!
5,Great for trunks with a fabric liner/mat,"I have had this tote for over 2 years and it's holding up well. I use it to store items that I keep in my trunk all the time - emergency kit, jumper cables, tire pump, a jug of water, etc. The Velcro on the bottom keeps it seated tightly on the floor of my trunk. I don't find the hooks are necessary because the tote doesn't slide at all. In fact, it's a hassle to try to move it around because the Velcro is so sticky. So, for my purposes it's great"
4,Fine item for price,"A few people commented that it slid around their trunk. I haven't found this to be happening after a few months of use. I guess the items I put in there happen to be heavy enough to hold it in place. Another benefit is that it's collapsible, so if you only need 2 of the 3 compartments, for example, the third one won''t get in the way. Overall, I'm happy with the product."
2,A cheap 5 dollar organizer would work just as good.,"I bought this tote thinking that it would hold the grocery bags from moving in the car and be able to carry more groceries into the house at once. While the tote does keep a small amount of groceries from moving when driving, it does a poor job of carrying them. The trouble is the cloth on the bottom is not reinforced with plastic or cardboard. For instance carrying a gallon on milk or water jug the bag is very weak and folds, almost spilling groceries when carried.I know this is a tough review, but you could spend $5 at a bargain store and get the same functionality. This product is overpriced for what it delivers."
2,Not very durable,"Although not completely destroyed, it is slowly coming apart after less than a year of use. Its probably great if you don't try to fill it up. With 2 kids, this thing is full of stuff and is constantly being pushed/pulled around the back of our SUV. The fabric is almost torn completely off the outside. I'll be trying a more durable (and likely expensive) model next."
3,a little flimsy,this tote is a little flimsier than i would like - i wish the sides were a heavier duty material so they didn't collapse under the weight of heavy grocery bages. I also think the compartments could be slightly larger. it does help keep loose items contained in the back of my Toyota Highlander SUV.
2,super flimsy,"this product is made of super flimsy fabric; in fact it arrived ripped in a few places (though that was also the fault of poor packaging). That said it does the job--doesn't slide around/stays put. if i had this to do over again, i'd get a larger organizer and one that is made of sturdier material."
3,okay,This item is only okay. The flaps that keep it sturdy don't stay stuck to the velcro. Almost everytime you use it you have to put it together again. Once it is set-up it does work well.
5,A Treasure To Read,"If you've read Garrison Keilor's tales of Lake Wobegon in Minnesota, you'll love this book. The neat thing is that the stories are all true instead of being made up. Mr. Shaw has a way of writing that makes it seem as if he is talking right to you. He'll have you on the floor laughing one minute and then he'll have you crying the next. His Christmas story about his mother will stay with you long after you put the book down. This book is a loving tribute to his mother and the great era he grew up in...the wonderful fifties. A must read for all Baby Boomers."
4,Good,The stuff in this book are very useful and easy to practice with the CD that came with the book.
5,"Man, O Manalive",This is my favorite GKC novel. Chesterton writes a grown up novel about those who must become like little children to enter the Kingdom of God. Chesterton treats each mundane moment as momentous and the repetitious as startlingly new. Life for him is adventure and joy and he can't stand to see anyone not joining him.The Spirit of God is the wind that moves throughout the entire book and stirs up the lives of all it touches.I'd love to see this book as a play.
1,Beware This Edition!,"Although not labeled as such, this is a print-on-demand book (the telltale sign is an output date on the last page). The odd dimensions (7.5"" x 9.25"") and the abundance of errors in typography make it difficult to read. There is also the added concern that since there is absolutely no front matter supplied not even as to the source edition scanned that this may be an altered or abridged version. Find yourself a better edition."
2,Large format: Unhady for reading or shelf,"Like a number of ""large print"" editions I received from Amazon lately, the larger print is achieved simply by increasing the size of the pages on a ""digital print"" text. For me that makes it harder to read than a normal sized book with normal print. Let the buyer beware and check the book dimensions. Amazon should clearerly mark these large formay editions!"
1,"Great book, horrible edition","This is one of my favorite novels, so I bought it for my brother-in-law as a graduation present. This edition is awful: tacky cover, horrible layout, each page has the little blips that come from being scanned. Buy a different edition."
3,Not exactly the Chesterton I thought of ...,"But not a loser. Just different. Crazy character quite tuned in to today's outside the envelope stuff. Reads quickly, thank God."
3,Left Behind With Some Real Creepy Monsters,"With a name this corny, it has to be good! Right? Nah, not really. The book is an interesting psuedo-religious twist of the rapture theme (mass disappearances) with elements of secret society paranoia. The book starts out developing the two main characters that unknowingly are destined to save the world. There are some interesting religious themes developed here, but this is far from a christian book. While the characters are interesting and well thought out, the action scenes get bogged down and confusing and the thrills and spills become a bit mundane. It's worthwhile reading, and at times an interesting story, but don't expect great literature here."
3,I've read worse,"I won't go into specifics here but I have to say I was particularly disappointed. McGrew is a talented writer and the Rapture take he utilized was very original but he just couldn't seem to get to the point. It takes half of the book for anything of real interest to start to happen, three quarters to get exciting, and then...nuthin', he didn't even do a good job developing the characters. All in all this would have made a gripping, intense short story or novella, McGrew ruined it by using boring plot points as filler."
5,I no longer have fingernails...,"Chandler MeGrew's latest offering, ""The Darkening"" is a fast-paced, nail-biting tome filled with everything a true horror-book fan could possibly want. Twisting plots and subplots make this a true page-turner and the details are so well researched that it adds an angle of believability that is sure to curdle your blood. McGrew has outdone himself with ""The Darkening"" and it is a must-read on anyone's list. I was thoroughly entrenched and could not put it down. Stop reading this and order the book already!"
3,The Darkening,"This book was an excellent read, I could not put it down and read it in 3 days. I am looking forward to Mr. McGrew's new book coming out early next year. Will not hesitate to buy new book and would recommend to anyone to read The Darkening. I am an avid book reader and this book just held my attention to the end."
1,First Book In Years I Couldn't Finish,"The first 50 or so pages had me very interested in the story, but it quickly fell flat. Then, 200 pages of characters running and hiding in town after town became tedious. The prose quickly became pedestrian and many times confusing, especially in the Keep's lower level battle with the enemy. I never got a real sense of atmosphere or terror, as the book's cover touts. Where was the passion in the writing? It felt like the author was just going through the motions to meet his annual book quota. I saw an ad for this novel in a writer's magazine and liked the premise and cover art and decided to give this author a try. Oh, well. You can't win them all. This is one very disappointed reader."
2,Read the Previous Review,"The previous review is fantastic. The story is readable..nothing more. And the nymphomaniac angle?..please...it gets so boring. All Hubbard writes about is sex, sex, sex. I'm starting to think he had a complex. As to the previous reviewers assertion that some of this was ghostwritten, I 100% agree. Starting with the second half of the 7th book, the author's tone changes noticeably..and declines in quality."
4,Entertaining,Entertaining satirical commentary about people and the 21st century (the insight in the book seems more like today than when it was written in the 1980's).If you're not overly literal or critical can get quite a laugh and entertaining read.
4,As Detailed...,"The books arrived on time and in perfect condition. They finished off my collection perfectly. Now, to find time to read..."
5,"Action packed, delightul satire!","This is a very entertaining and fun read! The satire is a thought provoking commentary on our present society. It flows smoothly and is easy to read. I have read the first 7 volumes and am looking forward to the 8th! I would recommend this to anybody who enjoys reading and particularly reading of a satirical nature. It is thought provoking but not at all ponderous or heavy handed, although the humor is delightfully outrageous in places!"
5,"great series, great imagination","this mission earth series is exceptional in the presentation and story line. There is an obvious philisophical bent, anti homosexual, women's roles, anti marketing etc, to the story line, but this is a very good sci fi audio presentation."
5,Beautifully written; offers new perspective,"Lawder writes beautifully of his life as an older Peace Corps volunteer in Africa. Rather than present himself as the savior of these impoverished people, he shows how he is, in a sense, saved. Adopted by a Malian family, he makes a life for himself with them, becoming a de facto grandfather. He portrays the Malians as an intelligent, warm, hard-working people living under difficult circumstances, and it's interesting to ""meet"" them through this absorbing book."
4,Excellent Read,"I loved reading this book and the adventure that I shared. I really felt like I was there with the author. What also made this book particularly interesting is that the author was older when he joined the Peace Corps, so he had a more mature way of looking at life and people. Though the man is not a perfect man and I think sometimes just a bit naive, he really was a nice man sharing his very human experience and perceptions. This book really is worth the time, and I was sad to see it come to an end. I highly recommend it."
4,Memory for Dell Dimension,"Was easy to install and worked the first time. Unfortunately, the older Dell computer was past its prime and I ended up replacing it, but it still works!"
4,"Brilliant philosophy book, just could be a little less wordy.","I am using this book for my Philosophy of Religion course, my last class before my Bachelor's Degree. The book is well put together and offers a host of viewpoints from different religions and religious scholars (of both major and minor religions). My only problem is that the philosophy sometimes gets cyclical or the philosophers get so wordy that you feel inclined to submit to their point just because they are double-talking so far over your head that you can no longer keep up. If I wanted to be overrun with long-winded, incomprehensible double-talk, I would go into politics.I would recommend to anyone that is using this book for a class that you take it in short spurts, one essay at a time, and make sure to re-read each one as they tend to make a bit more sense the second time around."
2,Missing Pages!,"I received the book in a timely manner, but the book is missing the ENTIRE introduction as well as the first 5 pages of Ninian Smart's essay, ""The Nature of Religion."" The introduction and essay are part of my very first reading assignment and I now have to go out and buy another copy of this book because the seller sent me a damaged copy."
5,Suitable for a wedding song,"I think I'll use it as a song to dance with my wife in my wedding party . It practically describes the feelings involved at the beginning of a marriage. It's a special song, the lyrics describe perfectly in that situation, which is in fact the beginning of a whole new world."
5,Cavalleria Rusticana,"I just wanna say that i liked this dvd very much. I am not a big opera fan, but i've heard CR on cd many times and i liked the music so much that a needed to SEE it since i dont speak any italian and can understand the words. I really liked the setting in the village and the filming out in the fields. You get better imression of the settings and the story.I recomend this dvd very much!"
4,Introduction to Italian Opera,"I used this video as an introduction to Italian opera in my high school humanities class, because going on a field trip to an opera is cost prohibitive these days. The students learned a lot and enjoyed the story for its melodramatic elements."
3,soft portrait camera,"If you shoot portraits, weddings, etc... this is a great, very soft camera. Not ideal for wildlife photography. I found myself moving to a Nikon after less than a year."
4,struggle for freedom and justice- gems of stories!,"Some great short stories about human struggle for freedom and justice. At first glance, the appendix is chalked full of short stories from many different authors including Pournelle himself, Poul Anderson, etc. Some of these aren't actually stories, but essays. I bought the book to read sci-fi, not some sci-fi authors dystopia view of modern democracy (I honestly skipped the rambling and cut straight to the stories). ""Lipidleggin"" is for sure a one-of-a-kind prophetic story. And ""Dodkin's Job"" is THE gems here! A lowly miner ""raises the ranks"" to the very top then again to the very bottom just because he doesn't want to take his shovel to storage. So much ot it than that... buy the book JUST for this one story!"
5,Good devotionals to keep you on track,"I first went through this Bible in 2001 when my church was doing it together. Now, I meet with 4 other men from my church for breakfast once weekly. We were deciding what to do next as a group and I remembered this Bible. I ordered 4 of them for the others.The daily devotionals help explain what you are reading, put it in context, and guide you through each book. This is especially helpful in the Old Testament. Also, every 7th day or so is a devotional only with no passage which can be seen as a break or a day to catch up.It's NIV which is good. I highly recommend it."
1,The Daily Walk,The book itself was in good condition. Just a small piece torn out of the last page. Doesn't hinder the written pages. Don't like the King James version because it's to hard to read. Should have ordered the NIV version.
5,Excellent Spiritual Habit Builder,"This is my 4th year in going thru this Bible. It has been an excellent tool in helping me be consistent in my quiet times.The notes (Overview, Your Daily Walk, Insights) are wonderful, filled with lots of great illustrations and insights into the Scriptures.As a Pastor for 25 years it has been a refreshing well of living water. I've personally purchased and have given away over 40 copies to those I've counseled and discipled. I want everyone in our church to start reading it! You can start any time/date!"
4,Heel care looks great!,Received order as promise. It was package well. It was what I expected...will order again. I have used another product for a couple years but when I tried this product I loved it.
5,Ravi Singh: Yoga For Life,"Of the many yoga videos I have used, this one is by far my favorite. I do it nearly every day and when I skip a day, I really miss it. I always feel energized yet relaxed after doing the video. Ravi opens with ""Ong namo guru dev namo"" chanted three times and then combines breathwork, meditation, and various yoga poses--not at all like your typical Hatha yoga video. Ravi does tend to talk throughout the video, which some people might find distracting, but I am not bothered by it at all because his voice is calm and soothing and his puns are sort of amusing. Plus, I am so focused on doing the poses, meditation and breathwork that I really don't notice his talking. This is a video for someone at any skill level. Try it, stick with it for a few sessions, and you'll see how good it makes you feel. I would recommend this video to anyone."
3,"Not bad, not great","Interesting, if expected, perspective of a platoon leader in I Corps, 1968. Not many surprises or high drama incidents -- nobody's going to make a movie about the author's tour."
5,NEVER PUT IT DOWN!,"I LUVED THIS BOOK!!!!! i read it over the summer 4 the first time & read it again 3 more times! & i'm reading it again right now! itz fantastic! i luv it! it has suspense, luv, passion, & everything a girl could ask 4! hooever it was hoo said that u should leave the book on the shelf is crazy! i luv it. & that person hoo chucked the book at pretty much the v. beginning was idiotic bcuz the book getz better! xspecially wen the x-husband shows up!"
2,Yawn,"This was my first purchase for my Kindle; purchased before I discovered ""sampling"". Lesson learned."
1,"Time travel, cowgirls, rodeos, rebound sex.. What?","I couldn't wait until I finished this book to write a review. I don't think I am going to waste my time finishing it. I was ready for historical fiction, romance, the English countryside, etc. What I got was cowgirls from Wyoming, nonstop country grandma sayings, rodeo talk, lengthy discussions on rodeo horses and everything Hollywood. Horrible so far. The time travel was completely laughable. The main character has rebound sex with a handsome Cornish lord in a castle. From the beginning they are completely horny for each other. Not the type of romantic English story I was hoping for. Very disappointing. I am only 1/3 of the way through this nightmare and find myself constantly nodding off and rolling my eyes at this horrible story. I'm sure it will have a sappy typical ending so what's the point of forcing myself to read it. I'm deleting it from my kindle now."
1,Jaded tale featuring thoroughly unlikable heroine,"Betrayed Hollywood divorcee aka ex ""Miss Rodeo Wyoming"" ventures to Cornish cottage to recover from said divorce; falls for handsome landlord (predictably lives in castle) amidst a plethora of twangy Wyoming cowgirl one-liners, wisdoms from ""grandma on the farm"" and glorfied accounts of repugnant rodeo practices. Approximately halfway through this delightful tale the ""heroine"" then tearfully admits to an absolutely revolting act of cruelty against a rodeo horse because it bucked too much (!) thereby throwing and killing her younger brother. At this point I threw this charming tale into the nearest trash bin. Extremely disappointing."
1,Just AWFUL!,"Over the last 10 years I have read about 2 books a week- many of them romance novels. This is just about the worst one I have ever read. So much so, that I am actually rating and reviewing it, which I have never done before. What a mess! There was so much going on that it seemed as though the author put in every storyline she could think of all in one novel. I found I didn't like any of the characters, except for the little boy and the housekeeper. The rodeo talk made me want to vomit- it was so forced and artificial! Just awful! Could not wait to delete from my kindle."
2,300 pages too long,"I'm a fan of Susanna Kearsley. When I picked up her book The Winter Sea, I was taken aback by its length (500+ pages) but as soon as I started to read it, I was engrossed. As soon as I started to read Cottage by the Sea, I realized it would be a chore to wade through all 546 pages... and it was. It could easily have been half as long. By the end, I was weary of all of Blythe's cogitations, and thoroughly irritated at everyone in the historical backstory. It took me 5 hours to read A Cottage by the Sea... and I'll never get those hours back."
4,Wonderful read!,Feeling slightly depressed knowing I've come to the end of the story. I was transported to Blythe' s world and now must say goodbye to a friend
1,Boring,"This book failed to engage me. The main character chooses to run away from her problems, and finds a handsome man who's all too willing to share his life with her. The little conflict felt manufactured to me."
3,"Just ""So-So""","I read all of it but was sort of glad when it was finished!!! Only glanced a lot of the descriptive sections where there was no conversation/action - that is boring. Some offensive language also. Don't care for ""going back in time"". Really was not my type of book, but I hung with it."
3,Pretty good,"This was a pretty good read, but in parts seemed long winded. It is a nice romantic story with a touch of sci fi."
3,Slow but engaging,It's not the type of book where you are dying to know what happens next but it's a different type of story and well written. Very wordy or I would have given it five stars. There are points in the book where the main character has a thought and you can literally fast forward 3 pages until she speaks again.
4,"Wonderful contemporary romance, set on Cornwall's coast.","Brassy and independent American, Blythe Stowe, meets conservative English gentleman. Add a haunting, 200 year old love story and the beautiful Cornish coast and enjoy. Wonderful book to curl up with on a stomy night with a hot cup of English tea"
2,It Just Didn't Grab Me,"I really had a hard time getting into this book - I'm about 2/3 of the way thru and I have to put it down. There's just not enough there to keep me going - I pick it up, but my attention wanders. And normally I can read a good book for hours! I think it's the characters - I just don't care enough, there's no great chemistry or perhaps it's the way the storyline is presented.... I'm not sure. But I just can't finish it."
1,seriously?,boring - slow - not original - had the potential to be a great story line but the author missed the mark
3,"Good Book, but not an ""Island of the Swans""","Ciji Ware has a wonderful way of writing historical novels that bring you to that place she is writing about. She can write a contemporary storyline and tie it to a storyline 200 years before and keep you totally involved. I found the historical story much more interesting and compelling than the contempory storyline. If you have read Island of the Swans and are looking for a conclusion to Jane's life, I don't agree this book gives it to you. My favorite book of all time is ""Island of the Swans"" and read this book looking for some resolution of Jane's life. What I got was several paragraphs that, although interesting, was definetly NOT a conclusion. Read Cottage by the Sea and enjoy it on its own merit."
2,Wish this had a better description,"I have to say that I really was enjoying this book - until the main character touched a picture and was transported through time. That's when I put the book down. I'm sure it's probably a good book if you like that sort of thing.I was rather disappointed - I was liking the characters and the descriptions of the cottage, the sea, the grounds of Barton Hall, etc. and was looking forward to a good book. But time travel is not my thing. If the description included that bit of information, I probably never would have bothered with it in the first place."
3,A little slow,"I was excited to read this after seeing other positive reviews, but its taking me a while to get through it. The book just drags on and on. Its got got some good parts and lots of boring parts. I am going to finish it, but I'll be sure to try a sample next time rather than trust the reviews."
5,A really good read.,"I loved the characters and the descriptions of the settings. The interesting links to horticulture were a change from the usual. The ""flashbacks"" to earlier times were well written, and gave the story a number of great complications."
3,"3.75 stars - excellent, stayed up late to finish it!","I loved this book - I thought the story line was a bit predictable and there were a few places where I skimmed thru the lengthy text, hence the 3.75 stars, but overall great read. The pace was excellent - it was somewhat believable - I read a lot of time travel books and I thought this was a little different how Blythe is able to relive the past as if she's there but not really participate. This is my first book by this author - I will take a look at her other books. And this book was well priced - if you're looking for a decent read for a long plane ride or a good place holder and you like a bit of romance and time travel, you will like this book."
3,Not Bad,"I have just finished this book and am still amazed that some reviewers called it a ""sequel"" to Island of the Swans. There was half a chapter devoted to previous characters, and it was a disapointing half chapter at that. Overall, I thought the book was pretty good, but all of the references to Wyoming and the poor use of ""lingo"" could have been left out and the story would have been improved. I was also a bit disappointed in the amount of gardening references ~ I expected much more. That said, it was an easy breezy read, though not nearly as good as Susanna Kearsley's The Winter Sea."
3,Cottage by the Sea,I enjoyed this book as a light read. The parallel of the characters and the switch between eras was interesting. However it was predictable.
3,Interesting book,"I read Island of the Swans and could not put it down - one of the best books I've ever read. I was excited to read this book as a follwup, but was slightly disappointed. It was an ok book, but nowhere near a page turner like Swans."
4,Excellent story diminished with paranormal stuff.,All in all an excellent story although I didn't care for the paranormal with hypnosis and mirrors etc... It was extremely weird how the current Blythe Barton Stowe could call up at will the life of the previous Blythe Trevelyan and past events involving the members of the Barton-Trevelyan-Teague families. But I have to admit that some of the stories sizzled. Both the ancient ones and the current ones. I especially liked when Blythe's ex-husband and her sister Ellie visit. The message of forgiveness as a letting go of past hurts was delightful. Then since I'm a sucker for a good ending I was thrilled by the romantic end to the story. Right on!
4,Good deal!,"The egg shakers came quickly and as described. I'm not a professional percussionist (I'm a guitarist and engineer), so I just bought these primarily for fun. I'd say for the price these shakers are great, and I'd recommend this to someone in my position, but overall, I wish the shakers had a little less volume, and more body to the sound. Other shakers I've used have sounded better to me, but these are still very good."
1,Eek! Mine broke open!,"My 2-year-old loved this thing. Until he dropped it accidentally on the vinyl floor in the kitchen and it broke open scattering bazillions of tiny little black balls all over the floor. They were a nightmare to clean up. The little balls were so... squirrely! And I did not want the kids to eat them... what material exactly are they? Anyway, we won't be using these anymore! I guess if I really had to I would tape them!"
2,Shake it up baby,"I really wanted to like these better....I bought these as give aways to children when I was doing a lesson on rhythm at a gathering of families at our church. As a classically trained percussionist I am very picky about the instruments I buy, based aolmost entirely on the quality of sound they produce. Be that samdards that are adequate. This product lost points because because a few of them broke within a couple of minutes. I'm glad I bought extras."
4,Not packaged to be given as a gift,This is a great toy and makes a great noise for babies and toddlers. I only gave it 4 stars because of the packaging. It arrived in a heavy ziplock bag with no insert. I was intending to include it in a gift but can't because it looks like a regift.
3,Fun but very egg-like,"We played with these a few times and then one cracked. Oh well, I guess hardwood floor versus egg shaker, and the floor won. So the little things are very cute and fun in any event. Having four is useful because you can have one in each hand and play with your little toddler and trade them off. They make great sound and it's otherwise a cool toy."
5,Eggs wo Chickens,"My daughter loves them. Look nice, fun to play with and color has not come off even when my daughter tries to""eat"" the eggs."
2,Too boring,I am completely obsessed with buying new toys for my kids and when I saw these shakers I had to get them. I love buying toys for my small child that has colors and simple sound. I find that the right type of sound can hypnotize and entrance a child for a long time. I handed these shakers to my child and he played with it for 5 min and never touched it again. Its very odd because he loved other shaking type toys. I've given up trying to figure out why...my conclusion is this toys is just too boring for my kids.
5,Awesome toy!,"My daughter started taking music classes at 6 months and there were here favorite things to shake and play with in the class. We bought these for Easter and they're great! They are safe, make a nice noise, and an all around great toy."
5,Our Daughter Loved These,"I think all kids like these, but they are really the first musical instrument our daughter could manipulate. A playmate had them and they would play with them while they sang songs or listened to music. Great gift for a toddler as young as 6 months maybe."
2,Disappointing,"Great idea. We bought this book to take on our vacation--small book with lots of new games to try. However, we found several of the game instructions confusing and incomplete. I would recommend finding something else until the ""second"" edition comes out."
1,good cue with poor package,the cue was shipped quickly. i was a little disappointed when i received a big canton with two sticks loose inside. the package was very poor. the plastic was broken. somebody had opened it.but the cue is quite good. helped me in a few games.
2,Disappointed Manowar Fan...,"For starters I am a huge Manowar fan and I hate having to do this, but true metal fans would like to hear this instead of listening to someone lie for the sake of their band. Do not purchase this CD if you are planning on listening to Eric Adams's beautiful voice because you will not hear it on 95% of the songs. It's a shame but Manowar's pursuit of the loudest metal on Earth has backfired on this live album. The music is so loud (which we all like as Manowar fans) that it completely drowns out the vocals... Maybe it was a error in the recording or something like that but nevertheless I didn't care for the album. I enjoy lyrics and vocals the most when I am listening to music. I have seen Manowar 3 times now and they are still my favorite band, so don't get the idea that I am bashing them because I would never do that...Vsniper@aol.com"
1,sugar low,"I was disappointed in this book and was looking for more concrete help in breaking my addiction to sugar. If that is also your goal, I would not recommend this particular book."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"This was essentially a junk food counter, had little basic fruits, veggies and ingredients. Didn't meet our needs."
3,Disapointed,I thought this book was a how to book. It is a book that tells the amount of suggar in foods that you eat. This book did not tell me anything about how to stear kids away from sugary foods. I was looking for good sugar subsitutes and natural foods. If you want to know exactly how much sugar you are eating then this book is for you.
1,Pseudo Science at Work,"This book, while generally correct that over-indulgence in sugar is not great, is a load of garbage when it comes to scientific basis. I wonder if the author ever researched our biological proclivity toward sugar before running away frightened of its affect on the body. MODERATION is the key."
5,Sturdy & Durable,"I am very pleased with these shoes. I had purchased them for my son. They are sturdy and well made. They are padded thickly on the tongue area, so the straps don't hurt or cut into the top of the feet. They have a comfortable and generously padded insole. The arch is molded nicely. The heel is made of a heavy rubber that won't wear out quickly. We love the velcro straps, it makes it easier for kids to get these on & off, and not to mention no more untied shoe hazards. Finally, the fact that they are offered in medium, wide and extra wide is great. I liked them so much I bought the next size up so I'd have them when my son grew out of the first pair. Recommended."
4,My son loves these shoes!,"When the package arrived, my son insisted on opening the box when I told him it was his shoes. He loved them on sight! And he said they are very comfortable he promptly jumped up and down. He wears the shoes to school and to church only since he says they are special. He wears a different pair of shoes for play. On the aesthetic side, I wish they would put a twist on the design next time, like a neon color strip on the heel or something. But over all, it's a great product. Next time I buy, I will go for another stride rite. And if I may say, I get a consistently great service from Amazon. These guys know what they are doing for sure."
5,Creative Grit,"This woman is a magnificent example of finding a way through the dark night, allowing family and friends to help and continuing to create, despite hugely daunting challenges, beautiful and unique art that inspires others. I am a poet who had not written much in a long time and after watching the film, I leaped up and ran to my writing materials with words popping like popcorn on a hot skillet."
2,content seriously degraded by poor kindle formatting,This book has some passages that are readable and with good content but the formatting sometimes makes it incoherant and impossible to follow and sometimes with missing parts of sentences. Would love to read this book in proper form.
2,"too harsh a protagonist, feels stereotypical","Her loathing of criminals is so intense that the criminalelement calls her THE HARD DETECTIVE. Deputy Chief Inspector HarrietMartenns is in charge of the ""Stop the Rot"" campaigndesigned to get all criminals, even those committing petty crimes off the streets. She carries out her assignment with a zeal that at times can be frightening...THE HARD DETECTIVE is not an easy character to like because Harriet expects perfection at all costs, which makes her seem unbearable and intolerant. Superintendent Martens behaves more like a crime fighting caricature than a human being. Though the serial killer story line will hold interest of die-hard sub-genre fans, other readers will prefer some of the marvelous other works by H.R.F. Keating.Harriet Klausner"
5,"Titles are always good, and these are good.","Kickin' off Gumball's hayride through rock's underbelly is the primal rock single 1. New Rose by the Damned. Gumball's version of the Small Faces 2. Tell Me Have You Ever Seen Me is actually a send up of the version by the Apolostolic Intervention. From the seven league boots of Foetus the boys conjure up 3. Butterfly Potion. The grand slam rolls on with 4. Depression by Black Flag. And finally the hayride careens out of control with a stellar translation of Mahavishnu Orchestra's 5. Awakening.-- Bubba Lewis, Oct. 1992 [from the back cover]"
4,Artistic Erotic Japanese Bondage and Tokyo Street Scenes,"The images in this book, all Black and White, consist of erotic nudes, mostly Japanese bondage, some Tokyo street scenes, and some still-lifes. The photos are well composed, well lit, and highly artistic. The nudes are all highly erotic, but their lack of subtlty actually takes something away from the eroticism. Still, they are better than most erotic images in photo books today. The Tokyo street scenes are most interesting and I believe they make this book worth buying."
1,Don't bother!,I bought this card and hoped it would help me with my Vista install blinking when I did something that required more graphics horse power. I had tested using Vista's Windows experience and the card I had rated a 2. That was bad so I bought this card and now it's rated 1. I use AutoCAD and now I have to replace this card as it didn't hold up. I couldn't find a review of it and bought it on faith. New something was not going to work right for me when I saw the dates on the install disk were from April 2005. I went to the Matrox site and got the latest drives but the firmware is out of date as well.So steer clear of this dud.
3,Good book for a variety of ailments,"This book is informative but I prefer Dr Martin Goldstein's book ""The Nature of Animal Healing."" Dr Pitcairn also has an excellent book on natural remedies which also includes food recipes."
5,Good interviews,"Good essay about interviews of top holistic veterinarians, I was expecting more, they used a lot of commercial names, in foreign countries not available, any bibliographic references."
5,Veterinarians Guide to Natural Remedies for Dogs,A must read for anyone that has dogs and the info concerning the dog foods that we buy and trust is horrid. making my own now !
4,It's good,"I like this book because it gives your different insights from different vets. For me, every bit of extra information is important as my 4-year Siberian cross just developed sizures of which I was totally unaware. very helpful."
1,This book did not help,"I bought this book expecting a natural remedy for my dog. However, much to my annoyance my dog remains, and in fact the ""remedies"" contained herein have only made him healthier. If I could give this book no stars I would. I tried this product instead#15 Grizzly Bear Trapand found it worked very well. Don't waste your money on this book."
3,Not the best on the subject,"This book covers nutrition, supplements, herbs, homeopathy, flower essences, acupuncture, chiropractic, massage, vaccines, and a list of health problems and how to treat them. I'm not as thrilled with this book as some other readers were. It is potentially useful, but not essential. Instead, I would recommend ""New Choices in Natural Healing for Dogs & Cats"" and ""The Nature of Animal Healing"". They cover the same information but more in depth.What I did find interesting was seeing how each veterinarian had a different treatment plan for a particular disease. While one would treat arthritis with goat's whey, another suggested Chinese herbs. Each vet found success in his or her method, and you can combine methods to suit the needs of your pet."
5,This Book SAVED my dog,"One of my pugs has a collasping trachea, which out of the blue turned very bad last November. She was going to the vets every 3 days and was on 4 different medications. Still she was coughing, gagging and being lost her spunk. We even took her to a Veterinary College. Short of a very intusive operation there was nothing more to be done.I ordered this book, hoping to get her strong to face the surgery. Well the part on food allergies helped her.. and she has been med free since May. It is a good book to have on hand if you want to make sure you have everything you can to help your dog."
4,Holistic approach,I really like this book. It's packed full of information for someone wanting to use more holistic remedies but don't know as much about it. I've used this book several times for myself and others for health questions. Definitely worth the money. Lots of reference material as well. This book is with me all the time.
2,Leave it on the bookshelf!,I agree with some of the other reviewers for this book. The characters as well as the plot lack development. Too many unanswered questions. The ending left me thinking one thought: what was the point? Too many assumptions have to be made on the part of the reader and too many unanswered and unresolved issues. The writing was choppy and lacked flow. I would not recommend this book.
3,"ok, but over-hyped","The ""double story"" and children's version incorporated into the account are compelling and the Tasmanian location adds novelty. However, the book seems skimpy and rushed into publication.When I put it down, I thought of how much more impact this story could have had in the hands of a mature writer, such as Margaret Atwood. That said, if you like Atwood's brand of dark wit, you might enjoy this first-time novelist."
1,Dreadful,I agree with the reader from Sydney. This book is dreadful! The main character is insecure and whiney. I found myself wanting to read the book that Veronica was writing. Would have made a much better story. The only reason I finished this book was in the hopes that it would begin to make sense.
2,An Okay First Attempt,"I was really intrigued when I read the first review of this book. It sounded mysterious and juicy and interesting. And then I read it. I got half way through it and didn't want to pick it back up. The main character was annoying. I couldn't like her. I couldn't get involved with her plight. In fact, I wanted to read more about the other minor characters. They were much more interesting. Unfortunately, I had to finish reading this book for my book club. Otherwise, I probably would have just put it down and never finished it. By the way, none of the members of the club really liked this book either."
5,This is great for beginner collectors like myself.,"The book is comprehensive enough so as not to overwhelm the learner, but provides enough detail (of the history of frames and their construction, for example) to inspire and to help direct further investigation. The photographs are wonderfully clear and representative, and their texts informative. I was also quite pleased to find that two frames out of my own small collection were featured!"
5,Husband loved it,"My husband wanted this and I bought it for him. He loves it. It is a sturdy, well-laminated book that he says he will use a lot."
5,Just the ticket!,"Just what I needed to finish off the final phase of assembly of my Vintage 1966 USRRC/CanAm car. Carrol Smith is the man, good practical information. Thanks Amazon for getting me my bible."
3,Where to find it,I was disappointed that Amazon doesn't have this book and that the used options are ridiculously expensive. With a little digging I found that you can go to Carroll Smith dot com and order it shipped for only 25 bucks.
5,She did it again!,"Book #2 is every bit as good as the first one. NO REPEATS !... and new information on the companies that made these delightful pieces. Color photos, marks and all the information you need. Ms. Whites books are getting like potato chips to me.. you can't have just one!"
1,WARNING !! BAD LED CONTROL UNIT DESIGN,"I have replaced the control unit, aka led panel...all one part # CPWBFB075MRU0 three times. With the original unit that's one, Sharp repaired...that's two, one I bought that's three and now it needs a fourth. I don't think so, no more Sharp microwaves for me.If you want to replace the unit it is very east to do. Go to [...] and type in the model # it's about $[...].I would suggest a one month subscription to Consumer Reports to evaluate ovens before you purchase, it's only $[...] for one month subscription."
1,Bad Display Board Design,"I have had 3 display failures. The first was a few months after I installed the unit. 'Customer Service' allowed the repair with out cost to me. However, I brought the unit home and the display failed immediately. I returned the unit and the display board was replaced again. This time I had to wait a couple of weeks for the part to arrive. Almost one year later to the day the display has failed again. 'Customer Service' will not pay for the labor but after persistence will pay for the part.My recommendation is stay clear of this microwave. I am waiting for a class action suit to recover my losses.One star is to high for the problems with this unit!"
1,Stay away from Sharp Microwaves!,"I too had my display break after about a year. Same as others- when there was a minor electrical disturbance. Because I had memorized the functionality, I continued to use it- until the start button broke! Now it is worthless. Stay away from Sharp microwaves- they have multiple quality issues."
2,Display Gone!,"Just as the other reviewers, my microwave worked fine but the display went out after just a few weeks. Unlike one of the other reveiwers, I did not have the functions memorized. This unit was highly recommended to me by a reputable appliance dealer but it seems they, too, deny the display problem. The Sharp is the only microwave I know of without stove vents that mounts into the upper cabinets. This was a huge selling point for me but it was not worth the added expense of this now useless unit. Sharp needs to address this issue as it is too much a problem to be ignored."
1,Don't buy the used one online!,"I bought an used TopScore Pro CD online to perpare my DAT. However, I didn't know it has a ""license agreement"", forbidding people from sharing with friends. The CD is activated for only 6 months starting the day of the offical purchase. This is stated in the ""license agreement"" in the CD which I didn't know before I bought it. The CD that I bought from the seller is already expired! I was trying to save money but ended up lost it. Watch out every pre-dental student. We got to be a legitimate customer to protect the copy right for others! I almost fell in the trap and violate this license agreement."
4,NOT BAD PRACTICE,"I was ordering this for a friend of mine and thought i'd give a little feedback. I used this to test myself before the DAT and it was a good tool. Not a study guide but a TOOL. There were a few errors throughout the exams also. So be aware. Overall like I said not a bad tool, but buy a big review book like Kaplan. That's the ticket not just this thing. So to all those out there wanting to be a denist remember, study Kaplan first then this. I say this as a second year dental student so I do have some experience on the subject."
5,Great prep CD for DAT,I really liked using this cd to practice DAT test. It was easy to use and I could print out questions and review MY way. Other cds didn't let me print and review single questions.The computer tests on this product Topscore were just like the computer test I had to take for real.This cd is worth it.
5,Norton Anti-Virus setting--easily fixed!!,"When I first received this CD,I thought something was wrong because some of the questions were missing, providing only answer choices. **If you have Norton-AntiVirus on your computer, disable the box that deals with script because it interacts with the disk. This is a very simple fix and allows the disk to work perfectly. The CD is excellent and allows you to take as much or as little of the test at a time, receiving scores for whatever you take. Great scholarware customer service!"
4,All these reviews are pretty accurate!,"I read other reviews and decided to purchase this item. I must say that all of the reviews were pretty accurate. It was a wonderful tool, it had some problems (ex: wrong answer to a couple of questions), but was pretty true to the actual form of the DAT. Word up."
5,A must-have resource,"You definately need to practice the test process to get used to working under pressure. They really short you on the time for the PAT, Reading Comp and Quantatative Reasoning - so you need to practice working fast. I learned a trick so I could retake the tests again - Uninstall the CD, reinstall it and you can do it again from a fresh test. If you are doing these tests over several months,it really helps to keep going back occassionally to test yourself. The CD expires in 6 months, but you shouldn't be torturing yourself for that long anyway. The biology questions on the actual DAT weren't anything like I saw on this CD or Kaplan, but I guess that is just the luck of the draw. Good Luck!"
3,"Not bad, but not too good","Just as the other reviews mentioned as above, this CD is excellent for preparing the DAT. However, it does have some disadvantages. For instance, it is time sensative - it will expires ""after six months"". Second, it does not have any explanation to the answers. Third, it guarantees a minimum of six months usage. However, my product has expired only after four months, and the procedures of getting an extension might be quite time consuming and complicated.On the other hand, the product resembles the real DAT. It really gives you a chance to evaluate your scores before taking the real test. Among the other similar DAT preparation materials, this one is surely the best one.In a nutshell, buy this CD if you're a pre-dental student. But don't buy it too early and don't expect that it will give you explanations."
3,Incompatible software,"I was extremely disappointed when I received this product and found out it would not work on my macbook. When I finally found a PC which I could use, the tests were a fairly good representation of the actual DAT. The PAT section was easier than on the actual test, but overall my scores on these practice tests were comparable to my actual DAT scores. However, I could not figure out how to review questions I missed on the practice tests and I would have learned a lot more from these tests had I been able to review my mistakes. I would not buy this product again because of the trouble I went through to find a PC."
1,HORRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE FROM TOP SCORE!!!,"I received this as a gift from my wife's grandfather for my birthday. I tried to use TopScore Pro to start taking my practice test and found out I need a pin# to make it work... after looking everywhere i got online only to find out it was on the receipt. My wife's grandfather no longer had the receipt so i contacted TopScore Pro to get my pin#. Not only would they not give me a new one they were EXTREMELY rude and vulgar toward me. They acted as if I were trying to steal from them. My wife's grandfather spent a lot of money on this program and the main thing I wanted was the practice test now I cannot even use them! I cannot afford to buy another program so it was a complete waste of money! Do NOT BUY unless you are 100% OK with not getting to use it if you misplace, or don't get a pin#."
3,"Meh, its not really necessary","DAT Achiever, DAT Destroyer, StudentDoctorNetwork.net, Wikipedia, and This thing are your best sources for DAT studying. Throw in the kaplan book just to make sure you cover all the subject matter and you're complete.These exams are EXTREMELY easy compared to the actual DAT. That being said, the grading is very difficult. If you get just one or two wrong on a section, it drops you down more than a few points. This is how the actual DAT is, but the questions are a little more difficult.Use this thing if you're out of study materials and you have a week or two left till the exam. It's not really good for anything other than keeping you busy.Check out the Barrons book for the PAT section. The book is worthless for everything else, but it's PAT is really good. It's got tons of mistakes in it, so you must check your PAT answers by yourself or with a friend. Don't look at the other sections, they're all incorrect.I'm now a second year at UCSF..."
3,TOP Score Review,"Be aware when purchasing the TOP Score CD, that what you are buying is pretty much 3 practice tests. There is some information on tips for taking the DAT and an outline of what you should know, but it is not a study guide. The CD was good for the most part, but the solutions to questions were terrible, the perceptual ability tests were not as difficult as the PAT on the actual DAT, and I did find multiple mistakes throughout the practice tests. The CD will help you study, but whether it's worth the high price is for you to decide."
2,Not So Great,"I just took the DAT this morning and this is not the product to get to prepare for actual test questions. The orgo and genchem sections are pretty accurate to the test, but everything else is not. The bio section is much harder and specific on the real test. The reading section on the actual test has tone and inference questions, whereas these practice tests only ask specific passage questions. The actual DAT has a lot of rate, chance, and algebra questions, whereas these practice tests do not. The actual pat section is harder than the software pat section. The actual exam is sort of formatted badly. It takes up the whole computer screen and the words are big, so it takes more time to read. This software has a small window for a screen, which is convenient but not true to the test. This software is good for timing, but beware of content!"
3,Just okay,I thought it was good format practice for the actual DAT but I found the science questions weren't similar at all. The PAT was excellent practice though.
4,a history of narrative films,"i bought this for my international film class. It does a thorough job of explaining each movie and each important scene. It spans from early film making to pretty much and other film in this industry. The author does a good jub at giving the readers useful information about each different era too. I didn't understand some of the text, i thought it was kind of hard, but all in all not a bad book."
3,Oi!! Could you go in a straight line just once?,"This book has a ton of information; but I challenge you to extract that information without pulling your hair out first. It was a required text for class and I dreaded every assignment from it. It has pages that are well organized and communicate information and interest very well. But, it also has pages and pages and pages that read like a first draft or outline, complete with unexplained tangents. The author and his editors have such a thorough knowledge of the subject that they miss the numerous and illogical side trips they make in the text. Side trips would be fine if the core message were clear. To be a truly effective teaching tool or an efficient reference, this book needs to be overhauled, restructured, redesigned, and re-indexed."
1,outdated,"Did not realize this cookbook was written in the early 1900's. As with most cookbooks back then, the recipes lack specifics. Was not very reliable for present day cooking at high altitudes."
1,"Outdated, of no use to me","I received this as a gift, and am very disappointed in it; it was written in 1903 and is not at all helpful for high altitude cooking/baking. Has no oven temps, many recipes do not list ingredients, but only include them in the mixing instructions. I'm returning it."
5,High Altitude Cookbook,"I purchased this item as a present for a family member. I did not personally use the book, but the recipient was very happy with it. I don't believe she has had time to try any of the recipes yet."
1,Worst cook bok ever....,"This is a very silly book. It looks like it came from a church bizarre with an accumulation of old lady recipes. It has absolutely NOTHING to do with high altitude cooking. It doesn't tell you how to alter recipes for high altitude. It gives very ""iffy"" directions like ""cook at moderate heat until done"". That tells you absolutely nothing. Worthless book with inane recipes. Don't waste you time or $$$$."
3,Big Cats review,"This was a good video in that it showed life for these beautiful big cats.It is seperate stories that all have to do with aspects of these cats lives.If you like documentories about life in Africa, you will like this."
2,would not recommend this soup,"I can't honestly recommend this soup anyone. Canned soups are convenient, and many are even pretty tasty. But this is not one of them."
2,Worthless Warranty,"Bought and paid extra for this battery because it had a 3 year warranty. However, if you make a warranty claim after 90 days they make you pay $7.50 for shipping so you know you're paying for the replacement. The battery did last for about 18 months but so too did the batteries I bought elsewhere for $7.00. It's a shame they can't be honest up front and tell you this."
4,Fantastic.,"This is not a stage production. It seemed to have been filmed in a studio, but it is an opera. I love the leads. Kiri Te Kanawa as the Comtessa. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau could really put a smirk on his face. Mirella Freni as Susanna. Hermann Prey as Figaro. Maria Ewing as Cherubino looked young enough to pass for 15. Janet Perry as Barbarina. All the leads apparent ages were believable. None of them were the ""over aged over upholstered"" figures of some other versions. (I especially dislike the overly full tightly corseted figures of some soprano's). The one fault is that at times it seemed that the focus was not as sharp as it should have been. The colors were good. The costuming seemed accurate. Do not confuse me with an authority on opera, but Wow. I am so pleased with this."
2,Music/Singing Good; Film Production Clunky and Painful To Watch,"This production is best listened to, not watched. The staging is incredibly clunky, and the ""thinking"" arias (i.e. singing, but no lip movement) are hard to watch. I want to see Cherubino sing Non so piu, and emote through the singing, not just mug to the camera while the soundtrack plays.A real disappointment. I cannot fathom why this video has been rated so highly."
3,What a waste,"With talent like Freni, Te Kanawa, Prey and Perry .. Ponnelle couldn't trust them to get it right? So he has them standing around not knowing where to look, doing nothing, while their own sound track plays in the background. These are marvelous voices, and I'll keep the DVD .. you do need to remember when to close your eyes."
4,Comprehensive guide,"This is the same book as French Cheese, in case you were wondering, with a few very small differences. The ""legend"" for classifying is different and the price of the book is different. It's an excellent reference guide."
2,A basic intro to the subject for non-electrical engineers,"This book, a fairly short paperback, is a good first exposure to the subject of power line harmonics in an industrial or commercial setting for electricians or non-electrical engineers. This book is NOT for the electrical engineer designing or planning line harmonic countermeasures."
3,Incomplete,"This ook leaves out several key pieces of data. First of all, many of the dreams I tired to look up are not included in this book; however, oddities such as ""zodiac"" and ""yield"" abound. Most of the dream index is either too general or too specified, and much of it is based on common superstitions which are well known. However, it can be helpful in teaching how to interpret your own dreams by the well written introduction."
1,So Negative!!!,"I recieved this book as a gift. And as it is beautiful, it is extremely negative! After several days I began to see a pattern. Every interpretation was negative, whereas using my other book(which I borrowed out and am looking for a new copy now)I had a more balanced daily review. The two books didnt agree on even the fundamentals. Wish I could remember the exact name...I dont so im sifting thru. I did an experiment and openned this book randomly and read the entire page...guess what? 7 or 8 out of 10 comments were negative. Appearantly the woman I inherited the book from had similar complaints."
3,Helpful to some degree,"I bought this book more out of curiosity than anything else. While it seems to be very comprehensive and helpful in many ways, the problem I have with it is that there doesn't seem to be any room for someone's personal interpretation. In other words, while I found many of Miller's thoughts to be on the money, some seemed to be more from an individual viewpoint, not a general acceptance of other possibilities. Still, I would use this book in conjunction with other sources to help understand what our dreams may represent. Jim Fargiano, author of The Spoken Words of Spirit: Lessons From The Other Side"
2,10000 Dreams Interpreted,"This was the most negative dream book that I have ever read. Almost every dream researched, claimed to be a warning of death, hardship or unhappiness, without addressing the symbolism of objects and or events. One can understand some dreams to denote these omens, however when you randomly read headings, most of them are about the same fate. Read this book for its entertainment value only, otherwise it could cause you much grief and anguish."
3,Not what I expected,"Although this is a big book with lots of interpertations, most seem to be very dark. I didn't realize how many harbingers of bad news I could possibly dream of."
1,Everything Means Death,"I got this book because I have strange dreams myself and thought it would be interesting to see if they meant anything. What I didn't want to hear was that every single thing that I dreamed about would mean death or misfortune. I personally agree with what another reviewer said, this book is a collection of Mr. Miller's interpretation of dreams and nothing more."
5,This was a Christmas gift,"I got this one for my mother for Christmas.She loves Conway Twitty music,She had the the tape of this but it broke. She was really surprised when she opened this present on Christmas."
4,A fascinating insight,"into what it must have been like to go through the process on Ellis Island. I had visited Ellis Island earlier this year,on a trip to New York and was struck by the atmosphere and history. The photographs in this book catch the essence of this landmark and the diversity of the people. There is also an explanation of the process that the individuals had to go through before being allowed to enter the US."
5,It was fate,"I was looking for something. I didn't specifically know, however. I wanted some hip-hop. I wanted something that I never heard of before. I wanted to buy a random album that I was never told about, and find greatness.Suprisingly, this is exactly what happended. I found Ink is My Drink, and was impressed. Unforunatly, I was looking for christmas presents, so the album went to my brother. He, of course, burnt it for me. This album is great. Finding it was fate."
5,fairytale magic,"I'll also endorse ""Butterfly Sign"" (sung by Plavka), one of the many excellent songs on this album; it's simply a brilliant pop single. But the rest of this woefully neglected album is also amazing. Yes, there are guest appearances from Doloros of the Cranberries, Jim Kerr from Simple Minds, and Midge Ure from Ultravox, along with some lesser names; but it all flows and sounds great together. Lots of catchy electro-pop with dance beats, but also some really cool and atmospheric instrumental passages. What really holds this album together is the fact that there are plenty of just plain good songs, ones that stick in your head. Nearly 20 years on, this album still sounds magical."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I was excited when I initially made the purchase, however, I was very disappointed when it arrived. The handle on the lid in the picture made it look like an apple stem, however the casserole that arrived had a simple common round lid handle, which made it look like a weird red pot. Needless to say, I returned it, and I am still waiting for a refund. Buyers beware."
5,Amazing taste for the price,This tea is amazing! i love the taste and smell of it. I average anywhere from 3-5 cups of this stuff a day and cant get enough! plus the price is insane. a definite buy for the jasmine tea lover.
1,very disappointed....,I purchased this tea when my other Jasmine tea was out of stock. I found the Jasmine flavor in this brand very lacking... compared to my other tea - even when I increased the number of tea bags and brewing time per cup.
4,jasmine green tea,"The tea smells great and give you just the hint of Jasmine. But the price is what is so incredible. I drink a lot of tea, so I was very happy to find Amazon carried a Jasmine Green Tea. It is definitely worth it."
5,Expectations Met,The quality of the video is excellent especially as being used for educational purposes- thus I am pleased on receiving the product. The delivery was also quick.
4,great stuff,"- this man is superb, his music is interesting, melodic, some times twisted and with a touch of the dark side...- I have luckily held on to my vinyl picturedisc ""on the other hand theres a fist"" - but is there anything else available on cd..."
5,Have fun - Enjoy Jona Lewie!,"This man has always been selling ""hard to find"" records. I think I have them all, but being able to travel trough a decade of his music on one CD is just fantastic! Enjoy the brilliance of this man and the magic of his music! For synthlovers and people who like to have fun!"
4,"Very pleasant, relaxing, inspiring background music","I really like this CD as it plays. I would not exactly call it energizing, but still it is good, and inspiring."
3,OK Basic MP3,"This is a basic MP3 Player. It has the typical features of other Players, FM, voice recorder, picture viewer etc, However, it lacks the control features of some other models but works just fine."
3,question,"i havent actually listened to this...but i was wondering..is this the soundtrack to the tv production of cinderella? with julie andrews?or is this some non-descript version, i want to be sure b/c it is used.is there any way to confirm?"
3,"Nice cap, but sized too small","This is a cool cap, but it cannot be sized larger than medium (at least the one we got). I gave it to my grandson who loves it."
5,Breaking through to genuine wealth,"A real breakthrough to inner and outer wealth. Many golden secrets and practical guidelines on fruitful living and constructive wealth creation. I am glad that my colleagues recommended this rare gem to me! It uplifts my perspective immensely ! Essential reading for all managers and organisational leaders, in the Human Resource, Personnel, Finance, Marketing, Customer Relationship depts."
4,Greatest Gift of All - A Son Like You,"Heartwarming, touching - brought tears to my eyes... especially since I sent it to my son serving in Iraq. A beautiful collection of memories in print - seemed every poem was written just for him."
3,Slow down lady...,"Too loud, too enthusiastic and too fast. It's like trying to do a relaxation in a funk class. Great concept, but your inner eye will have difficulty keeping up with the narration."
3,A good beginners guide to Metaphysics,Very Short and simple book written with less Jargons. Useful for newbeis who are interested to know more about consciousness and metaphysics. Free CD is useful to start your Flowdreaming. Recommended to buy if you have not heard about creative visualization or Silva Ultramind or NLP.
1,Too Much Ego,"I have always been a fan of ""real life"" accounts of adventure and discovery but I had to but this book down mid-read. The authors display such acute egoism in ""Beyond Mammoth Cave"" that it became annoying to me as a reader. Their accounts of fellow cavers were so skewed with unnecessary derogatory personal comments that it kept me from enjoying the book.Call me sensitive, but what ever happened to camaraderie and teamwork? Personal bias and honesty are not the same beast. I feel sympathetic towards the unfortunate cavers that made the mistake of entering into the dark hole of Mammoth Cave with James Borden and Roger Brucker."
5,Gore and Crazy anime must see,"Elfen Lied is a very interesting anime to watch. Its not too bad in the blood and gore side . I think only half the eps have gore. Blood in the other half not much to make it rated MA but some themes you might not find that suitable. You think Lucy is just evil but you'll find out she is good inside also. I think in the end her personality of Nyu and Lucy became one again because Lucy showed sad emotions in the end. Hopefully I would like to see a sequal in the future. I would like to see what are the directors plans, a more happier mood, and Lucy back to unified personality."
3,Not really for beginners,"This book is really not a good book for beginners and most non-beginners who approach it will learn little from it. The examples and terms are badly explained, sometimes it will say things like ""now black must play 8"" without any explanation at a point when it is not immediately obvious why, unless you have a quite developed knowledge of the game already. The book could be well used as a reference book but to begin with i'd look somewhere else. Janice Kim's books seem to have the best ratings so far so for a beginner that could be a more appropriate purchase."
1,Waste of $,"The only reason I even gave it one star is because it's cute! However, it was shipped to me not working. It is suppose to be new, but it looks used. The container it came in has seen better days. Based on the condition of this watch I wouldn't purchase any Activa watch!!! I will be returning this one!"
5,Outstanding,"This blower is the exact OEM replacement part for the blower that came with my boat....18 years ago. I mean that as a great compliment.....the first one lasted 18 years, so I assume this one will last just as long. A beautifully simple product that is very easy to install. Works perfectly."
3,Excellent reading for both midwives and African-Americans,"Motherwit is a fascinating glimpse into the life of Onnie Lee Logan, Alabama's last ""granny midwife"". She is a wise and skillful midwife, meeting the needs of Merengo County, one of the poorest in Alabama. Her service to the black population is at first appreciated, because the doctors weren't interested in treating them. As midwifery and homebirth grows more popular, many well-off white couples hire her to deliver their babies at home, and soon she and her fellow midwives are no longer granted liscences to practice midwifery. The midwife will enjoy Onnie Lee's wisdom and compassion in caring for her clients; the African-American will appreciate her struggles to claim her place of service to her community. Christians will appreciate Onnie's frank faith in God, Who called her to midwifery and designed to process of birthing babies."
1,Bohemian Heart by James Dalessandro,"From page one I was taken in by the city I love, San Francisco. Every turn on every street felt like home. While some of the sex narrative was more than I needed to know, I was enmeshed through it like I was there. The twists of Lombard Street are only matched by the authors ability to take new turns through out the pages. I can't wait for him do another book."
3,sad,book looks interesting and simple on the outside cover and in the inside information is difficult to grasp and bland/boring. Maybe another book to help this book come to life will do the trick. My copy was old but fair.
5,Worth every Penny !,"I finally listened to every symphony after 2 weeks. I have to say, every performance sounded quite prestine. I especially enjoyed the 6th and the 9th.I agree with one reviewer in that the first movement of the 5th seemed a tad fast. Honestly thats the only complaint I have of this collection. If you enjoy classical music and appreciate high fidelity music, this is a must have !"
1,much lacking,"I agree with the weak review, and am sorry I purchased this set. Flat, unemotional; expression is non existant compared with the Muti, and Solti sets with Philadelphia and Chicago. It would be hard to get hooked on Beethoven with these recordings. I note that the musicians sound in the loud/fortissimo sections as if they are mad...and play with a pounding, hammering, hap hazard execution. Very disappointing."
2,Small disappointment,"Good performance, but poor, breathless recording (even in SACD version).Glaring contrast witn many modern ""live"" recordings (e.g. Philadelphia Orchestra on ONDINE label)."
4,A delightful read,Ever wonder exactly how to play whist and when to get ready for the fox hunt? Look no further. Daniel Pool takes you through every level of English Society during Georgian/Victorian period. Fills in tons of blanks you may have after reading an Austen novel. Goes through the basics and the not so basics in a clear and concise manner.Great read!
5,Excellent resource for understanding 1800's England,"This book should be required reading for anyone interested in 19th century English literature, or even films made of this time period. At the very least, you will come away from it VERY THANKFUL you do not live in that time period. Unless you were in good society, your life would have been miserable and hard. I'm sure I would have been a scullerymaid!"
4,a fun read,Very enjoyable. Anyone interested in the Victorean era or English history in general should find this a worthy entrant to the genre.
3,"Who Knows What She Ate, Let's Discuss Her Knickers Instead","An excellent reference for all kinds of Victoriana, covering a wide range of topics you never thought you'd want to know. It was a lifesaver when I decided last minute to do my 2007 NaNoWriMo novel in a Victorian settling. An all purpose go-to-reference, EXCEPT for the ironic fact that there is almost no info on food. Aside from a nauseating chapter on puddings, and an interesting section about tea, coffee, and liquor, you will NOT find out from this book ""what Jane Austen ate."" Still, it is a useful compendium of details and a good read for anyone wanting to imagine themselves in 19th-Century England."
1,Highly inaccurate - don't use as a reference,"My copy of this book has a zillion post-its that I stuck on the pages that had errors or inaccuracies. He even got the names of the characters in the books wrong!! He refers to Elinor from Sense and Sensibility as Elizabeth, and this is just one example. If he couldn't get the essential stuff correct, what about the details? Don't use this book as a reference for anything you're writing for school, or you're likely to flunk!"
5,"Erratum, for review of August 13th 2000","In my review of August 13th 2000, I referred to Sir William Lucas as a BARONET. I meant to wrtie that Sir Walter Elliot was a BARONET. I apologize to my fellow readers and especially my fellow Jane Austen acolytes."
3,"Good Concept, Questionable Execution","I found the book informative and interesting, but I discovered some arguable details in the references to the novels that left me wondering whether or not the accuracy of the book's contents can be trusted.An example of the type of reference to novels that I found arguable can be found in the chapter 'Reader I Married Him':""On the other hand, you could...marry your cousin...Emma and Mr. Woodhouse scheme for her to do just that.""Emma eventually marries her brother-in-law, not her cousin, and to my knowledge, no cousins of hers are mentioned in the novel. Aside from that, Mr. Woodhouse is opposed to marriage as change in the status quo, and would scarcely be scheming with anyone to bring one about!I think this is a decent introduction to Victorian times, but I'd double-check it as a reference!"
5,A great resource.,"I am both a historical reenactor and an author, and I find this book to be a great resource for understanding the late Regency and Victorian periods. The information contained herein is invaluable, and it's a must have for the bookshelf of anyone who needs to understand whist, calling cards, and the Season."
4,Great reference.,The author's extremely difficult style of writing can be somewhat distracting from the otherwise well-researched well of facts and details about the life in the Victorian England. Recommended.
5,Not a complete sourcebook but entertaining!,"A highly readable if incomplete account of life in 19th century Britain. A word of warning this book should not be taken as a detailed study of the time. Someone seriously researching the subject should probably look elsewhere. That said it offers a fascinating glimpse into various aspects of Regency/Victorian life answering many of the questions any contemporary fan of Dickens, Austen, Gaskell, or Eliot, might have. From the social difference in status conscious 19th century Britain between a vicar and a rector. How someone could actually be found libel for breaking off an engagement. Boarding school politics and even about British holidays and currency. Well worth the purchase!"
2,Be careful!,"Although this book may be accurate about the time of Charles Dickens, it has many many inaccuracies about Jane Austen's time. Do not take Daniel Poole's word on anything Regency, but double-check.A note to ""Krista"" who says that _Pride and Prejudice_ is one of her favorite Victorian novels -- That is ridiculous. Jane Austen died in 1817, 2 years before Victoria was even born and 20 years before she became queen. Jane Austen is a Regency novelist."
3,Entertaining and Enlightening!,"This book is a must for anyone who is truly interested in the nineteenth century way of life. Mr. Pool covers many of the essentials, and includes an enlightening chapter on ""Servants"" which I still refer to for my own writing. My only regret concerning this book is that it is more Charles Dickens than Jane Austen; more Victorian than Regency. In addition, there are tricky social nuances that he fails to explain in detail. If you are happy to delve into Victorian manners and mores, then give this book a go. You will find it interesting and enlightening. If you are seeking more of the Jane Austen era, then you cannot rely on this volume, though it is a fun read and fascinating in its own right.Linore Rose Burkard, Author, Before the Season Ends"
5,This book is worth every penny,"If you enjoy reading Victorian-era books, or watching movies based on them, you will love this book. It's easy to read and understand, and you will get so much more out of the books from this period (or the movies based on them). A fun read."
2,Use with caution,"Not bad, but use with caution. As so many other readers have pointed out, there are a number of careless errors in this book. The distinction between the Regency Period and the Victorian era does get muddled. Considering the broad timespan and variety of topics covered, it's still worth reading, but there are other volumes that you should consult to verify or disprove the many statements. (DICKENS OF LONDON and the DICKENS INDEX would be a good start if you can find them) The section on currency and it's meaning was interesting, but in no way should it be a guide in comparison to modern money. THAT would be a book in it'self. The dictionary in the back also comes in handy, especially when searching for occupations. Now, I will admit my knowledge of Jane Austen is somewhat limited, and I hesitate to recommend any sources."
3,Fun and Interesting,"What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew: From Fox Hunting to Whist-The Facts of Daily Life in Nineteenth-Century England, by Daniel Pool, is a nice book that is full of fun facts and answers to questions that come about from the reading of some of the great English writers. The book needs to be taken for what it is... entertainment, rather than relied upon as a historical textbook of any kind. I find the book an interesting diversion occasionally, and fun for picking up a bit of the Victorian period. Enjoy. Three stars."
4,Excellent if taken with a grain of salt.,"This is a nice, well written overview of some of the cultural idiosyncracies of 18th century England. It covers most of the essential subjects such as currency, inheritance laws and customs and the different sorts of horse drawn carriage.On some subjects it can be a little inaccurate, particularly for the later part of the time period, but for most people they will learn a lot about the time. I now keep it close and reread a section every now and then (I still find it hard to remember exactly what a barouche is.)I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys 18th century literature and wants to understand more about the time."
5,Concise and humorous!,"For all of us who have spent years studying Victorian history and still had the burning question, ""When the devil is Michaelmas?"""
4,Disappointed,"No, not at the book. This is a great book that I am sure will help most readers of Victorian literature. Before this book I used to skip certain details in the books of Austen, Brontes, or Dickens. Now I believe I have a fuller appreciation of the details in these books that enrich these novels. However, I must also say that I am disillusioned after reading this book about the period in which these novels were written. I used to imagine the times and places in Austen and Bronte novels as somewhat magical, believing that those were the times I would love to live in. Now I know many things I wish I didn't know or didn't think about, such as the lack of women's rights, or the difficulty of daily life. It took away some of the romance of those Victorian novels, and brought me back to earth. I don't know if this is a good thing!..."
2,BORING!,"Maybe the information might be interesting to some people, but the information wasn't anything you can't find in other better written books."
5,PERFECT!!!!!!,"I purchased this for my daughter's 21st b-day. I wanted something that would help in the transition from a kid to a young lady; something sleek, feminine, and mature to fit her small frame/petite stature. I had it shipped to her because she's away in college....btw very fast shipping....AND SHE LOVED IT!!!!!! She was so excited and said it looked very elegant! This was a great seller and would definitely recommend!! Thank you!!!!"
4,Global War for the Ordinary Joe,"As a propaganda film, this series explains the dire urgency of what was happening for the ordinary joe. The film's usage of maps helps to illustrate how the Axis threat had rapidly spread across both Europe and Asia.The War is explained at both a strategic level and from a point of human suffering. Unlike what I would expect in a propaganda movie with flag waving and parades, the film shows how formidable and dominating the Axis forces were: they were winning and the Allies were loosing. As a propaganda film, it works along the lines of showing a raging fire, and showing how the fire had breeched multiple barriers.The film is not join the easy fight, but to prepare the nation for a very tough, vicious war."
4,OK for what it is,"My husband heard about this movie and I got it for him as a gift. Basically, it is a string of propaganda regarding the attempt of Hollywood to involve the US in WWII. But he is fascinated with this era of history and he wanted it as part of his study on the forces in play during the time that wanted war versus those that didn't want war. I personally was so bored I had to leave the room, but if this subject interests you, you may like this DVD."
4,A complement to the US compilation,"Not quite interchangeable with the US ""You Broke My Heart..."" (Rhino)collection, since this one has seven tracks (3,4,10,14,18,20,21) not on that disk. Consider this one as a complement to ""You Broke..."", which should be your first choice for its better song selection, but do pick this up. Ullman has an obvious affection for girl group and pop readymades that is fun to listen to."
4,iPod manual does the job,"Since Apple doesn't include an iPod manual for us older generation linear types who actually like to read the instructions, this book will do fine. Like most computer books it's a bit padded out, but it gave me the information I wanted."
3,Ki-61 Hien (Tony),"The Hien (Code named Tony by the Allies) did use a liscensed built German engine, but this plane was not a copy of the Me-109. It looks like one and was the only in-line piston engine built by the Japanese in WW2. 2,666 were built. A capable design, it was later outclassed by later US fighters. Fortunately for the Allies, it was tough to maintain and the engine was not the most reliable.There are 30 pages of narrative, a lot of interesting B&W; photos, 2 pages of data. I think that the 10 pages of Air Units where/when deployed could have been better used. There are no color plates at all. In a book this price, there should be. The Hien used very colorful camoflague schemes, something you cant really see well in the 2 pages showing B&W; camoflague patterns.As with the other books by Bueschel in this series, I recommend it only because there is so little else available in English."
5,Required Reading!,"Upon the recent passing of one of our greatest Presidents, it makes sense to hear from perhaps the best Secretary of Defense (War) in our nation's history. Without boring the reader to death with details, suffice it to say that Caspar W. Weinberger took over our nation's defenses at the weakest they had been since 1939, transformed them into a world-class military power and probably prevented a nuclear war with the former Soviet Union as a consequence.This autobiography is fascinating and understated, as Secretary Weinberger walks us through his career of public service beginning as an intelligence officer for General Douglas MacArthur to his 8 years of outstanding leadership as the boss over at the Pentagon. Reagan had a gift for picking the right people at the right time and Caspar Weinberger was at the head of his class.You may be alive today, because of him."
5,Explains agribusiness finance easy to understand and apply!,The bookI needed to understand how agribusiness falls into finance and I found the right book. Great text for non students! Worth every penny!
1,Trash,"How in the world did this book get published? I don't think the author did very much research before writing it! Some of his opinions, interspersed with fact just makes it worse. Some of his historical references are seriously lacking and blatantly wrong! This was a huge waste of money."
2,Out of date,"This book has its strengths, but it is hopelessly out of date. It is much better to opt for Liungman's 2004 edition, Symbols -- Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms (ISBN 9197270504). It covers a lot more signs, even modern ones such as the At sign."
2,"Big taxanomy, little history","Having already used dozens of books on (visual) symbols, symbolism, and related subjects for my research, I didn't find very much in the way of ancient history of symbols in this book. It is a great taxonomy of signs, ideograms, and some symbols, all presented in the same style, and has some value as a dictionary. The cross references are very useful. Not very useful for researching symbols or emblems from the more esoteric arena. The visual overview chart is a good idea for finding a symbol by its looks, although I found the groupings confusing to use."
2,Dictionary of Symbols by Carl Liungman,"Wonderful dictionary, very clear and clean illustrations. Interesting text accompanies each symbol, with historical or alchemical associations. A must have book for symbols old and new. I give it four stars."
4,Touches The Tender Underbelly Of Grief,"""PAM"" is a literary work that is real and true to grief, but draws so heavily from the spiritual aspects of birth, life, and death, one can't help but feel uplifted as they read it. Christy Lowry's writing style evokes strong imagery that reaches spiritual and emotional places of the heart and soul that are seldom touched by the written word. This literary work is without a doubt a labor of love written from the heart of someone who has been through traumatic loss and used it to find a deeper meaning in life."
4,Pam:Life beyond Death; Joy beyond Grief,Poignant writing that showed Christian hope for the next life.A mother's love shows through the grief and loss shared by the entire family and gives hope to others who are in emotional need.Highly recommend this book.Rosalie Tadda
5,Portrait of a Mother Coping with Loss,"This book is a truly honest portrait and personal account of a mother coping with the unthinkable and unimaginable, the death of her young daughter. It is not about how we should buck up and get on with our lives (but it will help); it is not about celebrating the blessing of having the priviledge of having had a child to love. It is about how a Christian woman and real life mom, not superwoman, can come to terms with the debilitating and inside-out world of unspeakable personal grief. An intensely personal book for anyone who understands that life is, indeed, intensely personal. Suffering and support, faith and love, combine in this modern day Mothers Book of Job. For anyone who needs to know that they are not alone, Christy offers an open heart and hand."
3,RCA RT2620 - OK Product,"Recently I have replaced this product with an Onkyo 3100 5:1 .... I picked up the Onkyo as the RCA would develop an annoying humm with the power set at 60% of its maximum output after about 30-45 minutes of play. I am not sure if this is due to heat management issues or some other problem. The only other annoying feature I had with the RCA is I would occassionally need to hard reboot the system as occassionally on startup it would stop working.Overall, my Onkyo sounds a little clearer - but I have it hooked up to high quality audio cable. However, RCA unit puts out considerably more volume vs. the Onkyo 3100 despite being rated 100 watts lower. So at a minimum RCA seems to have a more efficient amplifier. Also, the Onkyo as humms at about 55-60% of full power."
2,R. Irvin,Steer clear of RCA products! This RCA RT2620 home theater system worked as expected until the warranty expired. Exactly 32 days after that the system is now a door stop. I should have known better after having to send back three Direct TV receivers from RCA and a malfunctioning VCR.
1,Contrary to Bible,"The book is immediately contrary to the Biblical account with its first sentence: ""When Noah heard the rains begin He built an ark... "" The Bible says Noah and crew began boarding the ark 7 days before the waters came. With the author's alteration, she removes one of the key aspects of the Flood account, ie, Noah's obedience to the radical revelation from God."
3,Fine Book,"I enjoyed this book because it went beyond the ordinary. It made me want to reread the Narnia tales, and to share the tales with children. This book isn't for them, however. Kenneth McIntosh's Following Aslan would be a good choice for the younger readers."
1,Biased,"Overall, don't care for her American ""Heritage"" series (although I ended up reading quite a few.) I'll just type in some of the inside preview page which is more descriptive than the back cover which gave a ""sweeping saga"" type generalization:Christophe Vallette - Driven by the death of one brother and the hatred of another, he created a new life in a new land.Moira - Only one man could help her forget the violence of her past.Brett - Wed to a perfect wife, ensnared by a bewitching wanton, he was torn between love and lust as the family was divided by the horrors of the Civil War.Lionel - A genius in the laboratory and a misfit out of it, he knew one night of joy and a lifetime of anguish.Barbara - She was beautiful, proud, and determined to prove she had equal rights with any man in public and privateLuke - His bold resolve and unrelenting determination were desperately needed if the Vallette dynasty were to survive the greatest crisis of all."
5,Great Philip Glass Release,This is my favourite score from a film this year. I listen to this a lot. Whether in the car or in the house. It's the type of score that I can close my eyes and be transported back to experience of watching the movie. I just wish that there was more of Philip's music on the cd itself.
2,insipid music,"In spite of the soundtrack complementing the movie, listening to it by itself borders on annoying with continuously repeated themes."
1,Total lack of originality,"Philip Glass has ONLY 1 trick in his bag and it has been recycled again and again and again. Let's face it - the one motif he keeps using, albeit good, can only go so far. If inspiration does not strike, do NOT push it! The one same old idea he keeps churning is simply stale and painless. He should just accept the fact that he is dry and stop pretending any more."
4,Good cd,"Listen to a few pieces of Philip Glass before buying. I personally love his minimalist style and the ambiance of this cd, but I also have some family members who did not like it as much."
2,classic Philip Glass,"The soundtrack is classic Philip Glass...boring. At first you may find it artistic, but after a short while you will want to rip your ear drums out. However, if you like this soundtrack you will probably enjoy his work in the movie Koyaanisqatsi (i.e., Life of Balance). Check it out at [...]."
2,LookingThe Way of KIng Arthur,Though the book provides an intresting look at ideas concerning Arthur and his possible origins it provides no expansion on therories already proposed by other historians. I found the Chapters on the Medieval mindset about Arthur fascinating but over all there was no definite conclusions. The book lacks a cohesive form and near the end is nearly entirely given to speculative archeology. Finishing up with an amazingly lacking Bibliography the book provides very little in the way of expanding the field of history. It is best left to the amature historian or curious lay person.
2,Half the size brake shoes?,"Really, these brake shoes are half the depth of a brand new set that I ended up replacing? I didn't want to buy another set of shoes, but I did, I looked at the depth of these ""new"" shoes that I ordered and I'm not impressed with the amount of material you use.Honestly the brake shoes I removed had more padding left on them, the only reason I had to replace them was I had a break cylinder leak all over one of them and destroyed it. So I thought I'd save some money and order it online? Wow, not impressed at all, if I could I'd send them back to you for my measly $$$ back."
5,Four Junior Detectives after watching it 77 times,"Four Junior Detectives is an enthralling adventure for four young people and viewers of all ages to behold. When the TKKG Detectives (the four young people) discover a hidden cave filled with excitement and thrill they also stumble onto the answer to a question of legendary proportions and it is absolutely wonderful to watch. The film is refreshing and unlike most films of today, an actual breath of fresh air! The film is dubbed in English so the spoken words do not always match the mouths of the actors however it is not distracting to most people I've met or to me, and I have watched the movie 77 times and am still planning to watch it more. For me this film goes right up there with legends like John Wayne films and Double Dragons. I would strongly recommend watching it!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Another Wolfe oddity. An ordinary man discovers that there arepassageways to other places and worlds. He becomes obsessed with asuperior specimen of woman, a goddess. Unlike Garth, for example, whohas a similar relationship, but is basically a superhero.There is a question though of whether this is all real, orsomething that is just in his head. So one of those stories where thesanity of the protagonist is in quesiton."
2,Sorry - my opinion differs,"Sorry my opinion differs greatly.I cannot believe I see all those 5 stars! 5 stars to me is for Austen's Pride and Prejudice or Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. 4 Stars would be for Stephen King's Carrie or Anne Bishop's Black Jewels Trilogy. I cannot see how this book is deserving of anything more than a two tops!I did completely fall for the character and his love for all different people he encountered, not just Lara. Even with that being said I think he really needed to pull open that hidden compartment of the desk and find a spine! Not Tina!!! How wishy-washy can one man be when it comes to matters of the heart yet be so fearless when saving another man's life?Although I felt completely robbed at the ending and wished for the couple weekends back that it took me to read this book, I would not buy a sequel if there were one.I wouldn't classify this book as Science Fiction Fantasy at all - I would call it delusional at best."
5,Subtle and ingenious,"This is something of an oddball novel for Gene Wolfe. Fairly narrow in scope, it postulates an alternate Earth co-existing with our own, which can only be reached through a handful of secret doorways. This may seem like a pedestrian trope for someone like Wolfe, but as usual, there are bigger issues afoot. ""There Are Doors"" is often overlooked; it really deserves a wider readership. Check it out."
2,Accentuate the Positive,"The premise of this book -- the sacredness of sexual union and the importance of gender equality, is noble indeed and warrants a great deal more attention by society. But I found the author to be far too negative in spite of some excellent comments. It was painful to me, a man, to have to wallow through an extended chronicle of relatively obscure examples of misogyny, used to make a case for change that is probably self-evident to anyone reading this book. Had the author devoted more of her research to the positive to which we may all intrinsically aspire, it would have been a more valuable read. The world can benefit enormously from a deep respect for all creation that transcends the sordid, selfish history upon which she dwells."
1,Author created her own history.,"Words such as ""new history"", ""pre-history"", ""fact"", and ""research"" just don't mix. The author created her own reality of what she wished history was like. As example: if Eisler would have shed her own biases and researched the initial ""AIDS"" work, she would have learned why the CDC changed the name of this very controlable disease. Instead she is blinded by political correctness and revisionism. Behaviour has consequences."
5,Vital filter for underwater photos with appropriate camera,"This Sony VF-MP5K marine filter is either a UR-PRO, or the next best thing, and will restore the natural colors lost underwater due to the properties of water (""Roy G Biv"" is the memory device we use to remember the order of ""disappearing"" colors as we go underwater- Red is the first, the UR-PRO ""restores"" this.) In good visibility conditions, the filter will be good to at least 20 meters / 66 feet. The depth will diminish with decreased visibility, and this filter is NOT what you want for cold, turbid waters of, say, Northern California. But it works quite well in decent vis and tropical waters (but remove it and tuck it away if you are very shallow, 3 meters / 10 feet.)"
4,IT FUFILLS WHAT IT SAYS,Very nice product - fufill the abilities published - comes with a flash difussor too.
5,Good Product!`,Downloaded the template and now Gold Seals are on everything! I would purchase this product again if I need more. Avery Products ROCK!
2,Not friendly to my inkjet,"These labels are fine quality, but neither of my two inkjet printers could easily print on them.After multiple tries, I was successful, but the ink just doesn't show up well against the gold foil - even on best quality."
5,Eseential rockabilly & jump blues!,"Every rockabilly fan needs both volumes in this series(each have 3 discs), which is incredibly low priced. There is seminal recordings here by the greatest rockabilly bands including Jerry Lee Lewis' wild boogie-woogie inspired piano pounding(think of Willie the Lion Smith, but drunk!), Carl Perkins smooth vocals, and early Johnny Cash. Popualr artists are mixed with obscure ones, but the entire collections makes for an continually intruiging listen. There is mostly reockabilly, with a fre R&B, jump blues numbers. They are all great for dancing the jitterbug. This 3 cd set as well as it's companion Voulume 2, needs to be owned by all serious swing dancers, rockabilly babes, and gents. So grease up that pompadour in a nice dome and put this cd on, invite all your Bettie Page look alike gal pals from East LA over and dance the night away."
2,This book is good for half the title,"I would like to start out by saying I loved this book at first. The first few chapters are well done; the concepts at the beginning are well explained and detailed. However, as one progresses into more complex ideas you would expect longer, more detailed explanations to compensate; but that's not the case here. Complex ideas are sometimes given ONE paragraph. A short explanation is good enough for what an 'int' is, but not for complex algorithms or how to analyze them. As I progress, the book becomes an index of concepts I need to look up online or in other books, rather than a source of information.Far too brief without being concise in many areas. More (and varied) examples, with diagrams/flow-charts/pictures, and connections to other concepts would have made this book much more palatable."
5,This book is excellent,"This book is not only fast moving, hard to put down, but covers in great detail an important part of this nation's defenses. Blind Man's Bluff tells the story of the Navy's ""Skunk Works"", with sometimes all too sobering details of the sacrifices made by our servicemen. It is on the Best Seller list and deservingly so."
4,Great book!,"If you have ever had any family who was a submariner, this is a MUST read. The detail and the information is great and the stories shed as much light as they do questions. I know I will be going back and talking to my father, who served on the USS Jack (605), to hear what he has to say."
4,Well written book for those interested in the Silent Service,"This book is well written and very well researched. Each story is tense and riveting. The amount of detail will answer many questions, but sometimes gets in the way.This book belongs on your bookshelf next to ""Das Boat""!"
4,Every Sailor's Dream,"Where exploration meets Cold War innovation-a must read for those with interest in U.S. History. From a Naval perspective, Blind Man's Bluff details the push behind deep water exploration and espionage in a time where brave sailors pushed limits to avoid imposing threats of nuclear war and the crushing depths."
4,IF YOU LIKED THIS BOOK...,"As a former submariner, navy diver and recon photographer, I enjoyed this book and found it to be fairly factual. However, the authors weren't able to get most submariners, deep sea ""saturation"" divers and espionage ""spooks"" to open up, and so there are few firsthand stories told by those individuals. If you liked this book, you'll love RED NOVEMBER: Inside the Secret U.S. - Soviet Submarine War, which goes much deeper through personal accounts told by operatives and reveals details about the most dangerous, daring and decorated missions of the Cold War."
3,"Much about submarines, but little about espionage","I was frankly disappointed in the book. No doubt it makes for exciting reading and I would no way disparage the bravery of the officers and men who manned these vessels, but the point of the book is left only to the imagination. After spending untold billions on these ventures, the book almost completely fails to tell us what information was gained and whether this investment proved of any real value in the cold war."
5,Well researched and facinating account of sub espionage,This book is well researched and provides rich detail about submarine espionage over a long period of time. It also reveals the political intrigue surrounding the decisions that put our service men at great risk and the incredibly stupid things that those in charge sometimes did or failed to do. This includes some insightful discussion of how misguided some of our Presidents were. This book is much more than just a spy thriller. It is also a factual account of the role of some great leaders and some who were mediocre at best
3,"More Khaki Worship, Seconded","This book is certainly better than all that way-too-precious Tom Clancy tripe, but it still tells only a small part of the Cold War submarine story. All you civilians are really being cheated. For instance, how come no one ever blows a sh*tter in a Clancy book? Or how about all the EOOWs who went into PD-8 withdrawal after they started standing Dive? What about the top-secret radio system that read the R-114 guages from the shaft lube oil bay? You're missing Snide Order Books, graping sigs, xoxing logs, sucking rubber, growling the Eng's stateroom on the midwatch (long and steady, matey), meggering the Machinery2 head, and of course, those True Patriots who stood TDU duty on halfway night - these American Heroes truly served their country. I highly recommend you read Steinke Hood Richie's review below (1/2/99) -JohnnyC, Bilge Diver for Democracy 1980-85"
2,Good research ruined by dreadful writing.,"A very promising book goes south quickly with its overly dramatic, breathless reporting. I felt as if I was reading the National Enquirer. The subject matter almost overcomes the writing, but because it's so bad the whole book loses credibility. I would almost say the writers didn't have the confidence in their material to let it stand on its own."
2,Disappointing - not as advertised,"I carefully read all the Amazon reviews of this book before finally breaking down and buying it. I guess I don't regret reading it, but it's going into the trade-in stack and not on a bookshelf. Just as many of the reviewers here have stated, the book is short on ""espionage"" but long on breathless recounting of accidents and incidents. The authors' non-historical background is clearly on display. In their defense, I'm sure they made every effort to check all the stories, and much of the information is still tightly held. This book should be written again in twenty years. Finally, the self-congratulatory afterword could have been left off. I'm sure this book has provided a catharsis for many submarine sailors, but there are hundreds of thousands of us who also served (essentially thanklessly) in the cold war who will never have books written about us."
3,Ho hum,The authors obviously did a great deal of research. It's too bad the book reads like a USAToday article. The was so much potential here and then they wrote a simplistic story of a very compicated situation. What a letdown this book is.
1,Uninteresting and poorly written,"I was sorely disappointed in this book. For all its hype as an insider's view into submarine spying, this reads like a grade school book report off secondary sources. Full of conjecture and anectdotal evidence, this book presents opinion as fact and does a poor job of presenting detail. The authors cover up their lack of facts with flowery embellishments and love to name drop. The Wikipedia article on the Scorpion is a more informative and interesting read."
2,Great Cure For Insomnia,"Being an old sailor I was anxious to listen to this book. Though the stories were good I could have cared less about some of the miscellaneous stuff. The various stories will have you on the edge of your seat. Perhaps the abridged version would have been better. I listened to this book on tape and at times they just went on and on for what seemed like hours about nothing.If I were the authors of this book, I would put out another book containing only the stories of the actual missions of the various submarines and the crews experience.Though I liked the stories, I did not care for this book and would not recommend it to others unless they are absolutely fascinated with Naval History.Folks, don't waste your time or your money on this one."
1,More politics than sea stories.,"I was expecting spine-tingling sea stories. There were about 3 of them in the book. The rest was details on Watergate, congressional approval, Navy politics, Russian politics, etc. Disappointing, although there were a few tidbits that were very interesting."
2,Awful. Don't waste your time,"I love military stuff and military history, but this was borin. I couldn't get through it."
2,Is This Fact or Fiction,"After reading a few pages I went looking for the bibliography to validate some of the information, there was none. No references, no footnotes. How is a reader to know if the book is based on fact rather than fiction. Where any of the crewmen on these subs interviewed? The way the book reads it was like the author was standing on the con as the events played out. How was the information gathered? The Navy had and always will be very secretive about what went on below the surface. If anyone knows of a more factual book about the cable tapping please let me know. What these crews did, given the state of the technology back then is beyond comprehension. My hat is tipped to all who have served and who are now serving under the deep blue ocean. Just my humble opinion."
1,"An uncritical mixture of truth, falsehood, and anecdotes",Here is an example of the author's gullibility. She repeats without comment the Soviet claim that a piece of espionage equipment they found had a US Government ownership label on it. It is standard practice in all of the intelligence agencies in the world to remove identifying labels from items they are going to leave in other countries.
2,Doesn't stand up,"Ten years after publication, this book doesn't stand up to other books on the topic. It's poorly researched, cleaves to the government line, and relies too heavily on the work of other journalists. After the first 100 pages, I skimmed the rest of the chapters. Mutual respect for the dead moves the book. Yet answers are incomplete. The living deserve the respect of the governments that still hold so many of the secrets behind the events described in this book."
4,Excellent travel companion,"I got into this book from page 1. Really tells a lot about the cold war, and the reality behind the secrets that the goverment kept. Perfect complement to Hunt for Red October.. The final could have been better..."
4,Well done,"This is a great set of espionage stories and also gives you a great understanding of where all that money goes from your paycheck each year. Entertaining but not a real nail-biter. Definitely fascinating. These guys nearly got us all a lot closer to WW III than we will ever know and somehow they saved our freedom too right?Well anyway, if you like espionage you will certainly enjoy this book!"
1,A number of details are fiction.,"As a former crew member of the Seawolf, and one of the nuclear trained enlisted personnel that was caught in the post overhaul enginroom fire, referenced on page 220 of the book,(in fact I was the enginroom supervisor during the event)we had successfully restored the reactor plant and the steam plant, restoring the ships electrical power and answering bells on nuclear power prior to going topside. NOT A SINGLE MEMBER OF THAT WATCH SECTION WAS CARRIED TOPSIDE. WE did our job, restored the ships power and propulsion and were given the ""treat"" of breathing fresh air for what I consider a ""controlled recovery"" from a serious incedent. We did our job and did it well enough to laugh at an outsiders interpretation almost 20 years after. Thank you Admiral Rickover, for the investment in our training that prevented the more serious ending the book porttayed."
2,Much Ado about Nothing,"As a layperson (with no specialized knowledge of military history either), I can't imagine that anything in this book should be considered ""classified"". Nearly every story appears to be old news; further, no story appears ""controversial"". Don't buy this book if you expect to be entertained with ""inside"" information about cold war submarining. The best section of the book I found to be the Appendix, where Soviet war stories were briefly recounted--it seems the Soviets, having inferior equipment, took the brunt of punishment in submarine warfare."
1,"It's a book about USN submarine accidents, not espionage.","The book did an excellent job of discussing many USN submarine accidents, but it was lacking in the details of espionage. The authors did open the door to espionage, but they never did walk through it. SEAL operations and the damage that John Walker did are only briefly mentioned. At no time was COMINT (Communications Intelligence) even mention or explained. If you want to read in great detail about a ""hot torpedo"" or how a submarine sinks to the bottom, you will find that information, but don't count on too much espionage."
2,A Perfect Storm it Ain't!,I was hoping for a classic page turner. Is there something wrong with me? I can't get more than a few pages and my mind starts to wander. It is a shame that such a facinating history didn't get better presentation.
2,Pretty Dry; Longer Than It Needs To Be,"I found this book to be a little stretched out in some parts. The insight into submarines is only marginal. There is no real plot, just a series of somewhat related stories. I would pass on it."
2,"too many disasters, too little espionage","Half the book is on underwater disasters. While horrible and unfortunate, it has little effect on national security concerns. I felt that the title of the book is a little misleading as I expecting just espionage achievements of the USN.The espionage that is revealed in the book, you could describe in a few paragraphs. Most of it has been disclosed in other articles/books. I agree with the other reviewer, the PBS TV program was the right format for the information provided (one hour is sufficient). I guess much of this topic is still classified (as some of the other reviewers seem to know)."
4,A eye opening story that shows technolgy isn't everything,"Wow! I was intrigued by this book, becasue although I remember parts and bits on the news, this book brought it altoegther into a comprehnsive story. I thought it was quite revealing how much the USSR spent vs. what the United States spent for intelligence. Who got the biggest bang for their buck? Well you gotta read it. The American technological machine is incredible. It makes me wonder what if they directed all that super talent and brains to develop a means were the world can be more peaceful. My father was a submarine salior so it was particularly interesting for me to get another insight to the submarine force, espically the modern nuclear force."
2,Uneven!,"My favorite novels have involved the Cold War and Submarines. Mark Joseph's To Kill the Potemkin is by far my favorite. But Hendrick, Clancy, and Taylor are close seconds and I have read them all. With this in mind, I was very excited to read this book.However, I found the book incredibly uneven. Some chapters were great. Especially the chapter about the USS Scorpion, while other chapters were incredibly boring.So in short, this book is a mixed bag. The subject is very interesting. The information, especially the recently declassified stuff, is also mind blowing at times. But as a whole, the book is pretty boring in certain parts."
5,An Exciting Movie In My Head,"Normally I don't read books with ""military"" subjects or ""tales of the sea"". I said to myself, ""Whats the heck"". From page one, I couldn't stop reading it. I lived with the book for many days. You get the feeling you will miss out on something, if you stop reading, even if it is just a book. The writing was breath taking, you want to know what's going to happen next. Will they figure out how to get the sub out of this situation? Was truly amazed with the story of spying, getting so close and almost getting caught. The authors painted a vivid picture of what was going on. Men overboard freezing in the high waves or the President talking in the oval office to Henry Kissinger. The book was a movie in my head."
3,Interesting but not well-written.,"The subject matter is fascinating and well worth reading. I recommend this book in spite of it being not very well-written. The authors seem to have trouble describing busy sequences, and from time to time forget to draw a written line from one event to the next, causing confusion for the reader. They also seem to enjoy using slang and other terms in unusual ways, without explanation for the reader about what it means. Still, it's interesting for the subject matter, if nothing else."
4,Essential reading for new submariners,"It seems to me that the government should have told us about these exploits long before the authors penetrated the classified documents of the U.S. Navy. This book captures the essence of the covert attempt to protect the cold war players from each other. A great book, a must read, for anyone that enjoys true, real life, sit on the edge of your seat exploits."
4,"Great information, some bias...","I thought the book was great and very easy to read. I think Sontag evidences some bias, probably as a nod to the people that gave her the information she uses. She seems especially critical and unfair of Admiral Rickover, portraying him as a ruthless empire builder and general hard-ass. What she fails to point out is that Rickover's policies and unwillingness to accept compromise were necessary to create a nuclear submarine force. Blind Man's Bluff would have contained a hundred more incidents of lost boats and dead submariners if Rickover hadn't prunded the ranks as effectively as he did."
3,Ignorance is bliss!,"I'm glad I knew nothing about this during the Cold War. I devoured the book, start to finish, on a single transcontinental flight. In my opinion, the book is interesting but anecdotal. However that's exactly the level of interest I have in the subject. I'm sure the Clancyites amongst us find it superficial, but I don't read Clancy (except for *Hunt for Red October*...a coincidence). So if you're put off, thinking that the book will be a drab recounting of infinitesimal cold war detail, don't be. It's interesting and worth reading."
3,"While this book has many facts, it contains numerous errors.","The book addresses a few of the events that took place, but contains many errors. Non-nuclear weapons do not have low order yeild explosions. The facts on Scorpion are less than accurate, draws conclusions based on what might have happened. The picture of hull damage is actually a missing messenger bouy. Sargo is the SSN583, NR1 has a crew 10 times the size quoted in the book. The reason you had to draw these conclusions is that this is still the Silent Service and responsible personnel that served in it do not speak out!"
3,Blind Man's Bluff,Sherry Sontag provides solid research for a riviting historical account of the birth and life of submarines. The machinations of politics and genius combine to create an entertaining read.
3,"""Neither confirm nor deny...""","Upon publication of this book, all submarine officers were forced to sign a statement whereby they could neither confirm nor deny any of the events in Blind Man's Bluff. This is a pretty convicing piece of evidence that the submarine action in this book is touchy and not far from reality. An easy and engaging read."
2,Interesting details - Lackluster writing!,"I found much of the historical detail interesting, albeit at the price of wading through some pretty mediocre writing. Much of the impact of the book derives from its many revelations of, what the authors identify as, classified information. The authors note: ""Most of the submariners and intelligence officials who have helped us with this book have done so only under the condition of anonymity and took great risks in speaking to us."" This statement is either an exaggeration or an admission that the authors enticed current and former members of the military to violate their oaths, breach security and break the law. Frankly, the ""read"" was not worth participating in this exercise - however vicariously."
2,Intrigue and conspiracy satisfy even diehard Grassy Knollers,"Lots of behind-the-scenes insight and under-the-table discussions. No wonder the US Navy did not want this book published. Still, there's a lot of fluff here, truly ancient history and a grand portrayal of some old codgers who seem to want their story told(Dr. John Craven for example). Between the fluffs are some nuggets, some which might even be true. Looks more like the authors got some cooperative sources with highly classified information and tried to make a book out of it."
2,Did they publish the rough draft?,"America's undersea involvement in the Cold War was an astounding story of ingenuity, persistence and courage. Learning this from Blind Man's Bluff required a tolerance for poor writing that I found difficult to muster.If not for the importance and intrigue of the subject matter, this book would hold no appeal. The sentence structure is often awkward and ambiguous. In a book that dabbles with technical information, this is unacceptable. Some of the factual errors are simple enough to betray a lack of basic understanding of the subject.Technical confusion is not the only problem. Subjects change mid-sentence. Adjectives are irrelevant. Punctuation is misleading. Even minimal editing would have improved the book immensely.I can't imagine why the authors spent years researching this book and then put no effort into relating the story clearly."
2,Save your money,"Might be interesting, but for me it was a waste of time and money. While this book does contain a little interesting information, most of the things it talks about could have easily been gleened from the news at the time they took place. The parts about the Scorpion and the Thresher incidents were the best part of the book for me."
1,All I can say is BAD & BORING!,"... I couldn't even finish it. It was just THAT BAD!! I had no emotion for the characters, hard to follow, poorly written & just plain awful. Were these people even there? Did they bother to speak to any of us submariners when writing this thing? YUCK!!"
1,Let the UNKNOWN remain as it is for National Security...,"Sure the stories may sound interesting, but how many men who placed their lives in harms way for the good of the NATION, and who still are, truely received any credit or DUE recongnition? This is another example of the attack on our governments military and displays lack of respect for those men and women serving for you rights putting theirs on hold."
4,Even the appendices are worth reading,"Unlike some previous reviewers, I found this book well referenced, at least for the kindle version I read. The Notes section at the end of the book gives detailed information on the sources from where the contents of each chapter were derived. One thing I'd like to point out is, although all the materials presented in this book were declassified, they are not readily available as any other subjects one could think of. The authors had definitely put in a huge effort to put all the pieces together.The book itself is very engaging and entertaining. I didn't mind the dramatic writing style either as it most likely reflects the authors impressions during their interviews with the submariners. Overall, it's a great read."
5,Educational Read,I read this book on the advice on someone who works in the field. I found the book very enlightening. There are some very smart people on both sides of the superpowers that are really not out to destroy each other.
4,"Worth reading, whether or not you were there.","The reviews of this book are also worth reading (some of them really cracked me up). They run the whole spectrum from drooling civies (who wouldn't know the TDU from a TLD) to the monkey-mates (like me) whose fondest memories of the northern climes were the lack of drills, cool sleeping conditions and lots of movies. I spent 3+ years on a SSN during the 70s. I am amazed at what the authors were able to print (I don't think they are in prison or have been audited yet), but I wouldn't take a chance confirming anything they wrote. The book isn't perfect, but it brought back a lot of things I tried to forget."
4,Clear & convincing,"As others note here, this is a well-written and exhaustively researched account of the role of submarines in undercover operations during the Cold War. It contributes major understanding about that era. Inevitably, it asks whether the risks and expense were worth it; but it offers no answer. Here's one: Spying provided incontrovertable information to each side about the other's intentions, thus reducing threat of nuclear war. The effort was worth it, not for what it achieved,but for what it prevented. Everyone involved in these operations (even traitorous spies) helped prevent nuclear war. To those who did so from courage, their nation owes gratitude as surely as to those faced the perils of a shooting war."
5,Fascinating look at the secret world of sub spies,"I think reviews are most effective if you compare the book in question to others that most of us have read, so prospective readers have something to measure it against. Blind Man's Bluff could be best described as chock full of action, suspense, and intrigue--with the relentless pace and stunning power of fictional thrillers like The Triumph and the Glory and The Hunt for Red October. But it is history, the events really happened. Truth is stranger than fiction. I would recommend this book highly to anyone interested in military themes."
5,Reads like fiction,"I hade the pleasure (?) to serve onboard the USS Seawolf from 1976 until 1980. During that time we completed three missions of the type discussed in this book. Until I read this book I had only a generalized knowledge of the significance of those missions and the planning and organization which was required to pull them off. Having the opportunity to read about our exploits in ""Blind Man's Bluff"" increases the pride that I've always felt about my service onboard ""The Wolf"". It truly was an historic time served with courageous and intelligent men. What a wonderful book."
5,"Fine Research, Superb Story That Had To Be Told","I'm only 1/3 of the way through this and can already recommend it wholeheartedly. A great read if you are interested in the Cold War, Military History, and Sea Stories. This is what brave men did while Clinton and Quale and the rest of their invertebrate ilk made excuses. We who remain free owe these submariners a great debt."
5,Outstanding Expose/Excellent Bibliography,"As a woman who is intrigued by submarines and the roles they played in the Cold War, I found this documentary written in a way even a layman, like myself, can enjoy and appreciate. The bibliography is an excellent source of additional information as well. Great work and a wonderful reference."
4,Horrible games between superpower,"The book is real interesting and you won't put it down until finish. The ""untold story"" tells us that the superpowers are playing fire at the expense of those brave men who sometimes even didn't allowed to know how dangerous their missions were. After all, I show great respects to those men who had to tolerate the sub-standard living condition in a sub for months in order to finish their duty. A good book just if you like spy story."
5,Incredible book! Truth better than fiction...,"Amazing! I read this book with my jaw agape from the beginning... and it just kept getting better as it moved thru history. Amazing insight into the minds of the military and sub/naval operations in paticular. Well researched! I have such newfound, awesome respect for our military intelligence operations, sub forces, and the men who dedicated their lives to it. Quite the eyeopener to say the least. A very good read and a definite page-turner. Would love to see more comments from actual sub force's men who have read this book. I would love to read another book on the subject, but am afraid of ""the letdown"" ocurring after reading this very fine, wide ranging, captivating book. Any suggestions?"
4,Very Interesting,"This book was very interesting. Its hard to believe what can happen without the genereal public having any knowledge (and all of it under water!) The stories are all during the cold war up to the early 1990's. If you are into post war WWII espionage & like submarines, you should enjoy this book."
4,Quite an Insight Into the Cold War,"Growing up in the 60's, it was often difficult to tell how much of the ""Red Threat"" was real, how much military hype, and how much paranoia. This book provides a realistic insight into what was really happening with ""The Russians"" and the American Navy when I was young, and how many of those scary submarine stories were true. The book also rekindled my boyhood fashination with submarines, and left me very much wanting to know more about their fascinating technology. While it is an exciting ""true crime"" adventure story, this book's chief appeal is the perspective it gives: how expensive, and dangerous, fear itself can be."
5,A Thrilling and Most Informative History Book!,"If you want to go beyond the fiction of Tom Clancy and gain an understanding of the sacrifices made by U.S. Submariners during the Cold War, get this book. Your appreciation of our veterans and current service men and women will grow from this book. The whole book is just a great read. It is the right size for a business trip and I'm sure it will end up as Holiday present to many. (I only hope there is a sequel!)"
5,A MUST READ,"Wow! As a 23-year submarine veteran who served on many boats in the cold war era, and as one who knew some of the ""players"" and events mentioned here, I found that this is a fantastic book. This book brings memories rushing back so clearly that you might think the authors spent many years on the boats themselves. BLIND MAN'S BLUFF is a fitting tribute to the courage, skill and patriotism of submariners. It is a MUST READ for those interested in the Navy, U.S. intelligence operations and cold war history. Although not ""endorsed"" by the Navy, it appears that many knowledgeable people contributed to this effort. The authors devote 36 pages on source material, chapter by chapter, inlcuding those from the Russian side. This is our story, our history and our legacy. I was so impressed that I bought 10 more copies for gifts."
2,Great for the kids!,"Simply stated, this book belongs in the ""Juniors"" section of your public library."
2,Interesting stories but not a real study of the subject.,"Where's the beef? Kept waiting for them to tell me about the overall program, its facets, and results. Just a compilation of disaster stories. Pick a couple of chapters, read them, and then move onto _Stalingrad_ by Antony Beever for a good read."
2,This is all unofficial,"I am a US Navy submariner and am reading this book for my own enjoyment, but the general public should know that everything in this book is unofficial. The US Navy does not discuss or support the discussion or speculation of the operations our ships perform. Please do not accept anything truth because it may not be."
3,a fair but not great read,"This is not a bad read nor a great one. Limited blasphemy and profanity. Provides good historical view of the cold war submarine force, but not as a much drama as it could have had."
5,Imagine what we're doing NOW?,"The authors take you under the sea and under pressure, laying out America's secret efforts to track, analyze, and neutralize the Soviet Union's nuclear submarine capabilities during the ""Cold War."" We quickly learn it was less ""Blind Man's Bluff"" and more of a ""Tag Your It"" undersea game; a game with life-and-death stakes where neither side came out the true winner. This is a terrific foundation for those interested in military history, especially lovers of the Navy. The real question is, though the Cold War has warmed, what are our newest submarines doing about China?"
4,Silent and deadly vessels of the oceans,"I got this book on the advice of a friend. I spent some time on one of the old diesel boats in the late 60's, the USS Tang .... SS 563. Submarine service was strictly voluntary and I got a pitch for sub school when I was in Great Lakes going to Propulshion Engineering School. My big deal was sub school gave me a few more months of shore duty and most of us were young and dumb. I ended up on a Ballistic Missile Sub the SSBN 642. In all the time I spent on submarines only oner person asked to be removed from submarine duty. There is a special bond amongst those of us who had the opportunity to serve on these marvels of technology. This book gave me a refresher course from another point of view and I enjoyed the book"
4,curiosity satisfied,"I knew in the 60's of our interest in undersea cables, but the ""need to know"" rule kept me in the dark as to why. This book makes it very clear why."
5,Blind Mans Bluff,Absolutly 5 plus stars.I have been an employee of a military contractor involved in the design and construction of some of the hardware. Very gratifing to see the results.
5,A Wife of a Submariner,"I have been the wife of a sea-going submariner for the last 6 and half years. He has never been able to really share with me the things that he does. Reading this book I have a new found respect and pride for my husband and all submariners. I know that most of you who have been 'in the trenches' may know the real stories. However, those of us who stand on the peir waiting for that first glimpse have little to no knowledge of what you go through. Reading these stories made me feel a little more connected to my husband. It also gives me tremdous pride in what he does and what he has done all these years. He has given up years of his life to protect me and all of us, just as many of you have. I have, at times, hated the Navy for taking him away from me but reading this book I understand why. For that I am grateful."
4,Excellent book,"As a former submariner and navy diver, I found this book reasonably accurate and very informational. There are always those who find fault and focus on a minor mistakes, and there were a few, but what's important is that this book, and a more recent one titled Red November, finally tell the story about what us submariners, divers and operatives did during the Cold War to protect their freedom of speech."
4,Fascinating,A fascinating read that is well researched. If you have ever been associated with the U.S. submarine force or are generally intrigued by real-life espionage you will not want to miss this book.
3,Nora,"I wasn't a fan of Cal...most of the time I thought he was an arrogant jerk! I liked the beginning and end of the story, but not the middle. I got so mad a Cal I didn't want to finish reading it. Although, in defense of Palmer, I do think the story was realistic in regards to the characters' actions. Many people jump to conclusions and misinterpret things causing hurt feelings and anger. However, if I am reading a story, I don't really want the realistic, I want the fairytale where the hero sweeps me off my feet."
4,Very good book,Wished there would have been an epilogue to know about the children they had. I do enjoy Diane Palmer books.
2,Good not great,"Interesting storyline but predictable sequence of events. Not the best Diana Palmer book I have read, but I will still continue to read what she publishes."
3,Lots of twists and turns,"The beginning is slow and not engaging but endue because when it picks up you are in for a good ride. Good character development, face pace with interesting details. Lots of relevant historical details built in. The only slight negative is you pretty much know there will be a positive outcome to the many obsticals presented."
3,A good beginning of the story,"I don't appreciate the hero of the story, Cal who appears to be so self-centered and has given so much sufferings to Nora who, in my opinion, doesn't deserve all of these. I has the perception that the author always tends to depict her characters into two forms: for man, they are aggressive, ruthless and sometimes very rude; for woman, they are naive,innocent and lovely. Very feminine. I would like to see more changes in the development of her characters which are closer to people we see in our real life and inborn with some of the virtue we admire. However, her another story ""hunter"" is fascinating. The struggle and passion of the two characters are strongly felt and are vividly described. It has become one of my favorites."
2,Not for the classroom,"This book is for anything but the classroom. The material is too complex for new students. I used it in three sessions. I could not get over the stress of teaching it. My students found that AE is too hard. It seems that the writers ignored that people have short memories. They expected the readers to keep up with a long project, the subject of the book. I found that the Meyer books had a better approach."
4,Slammin',"This CD has such a variety of music from somewhat traditional songs like ""He is God"" to contemporary jams like ""We Give You Praise."" Finally the slow melodic ministry of ""Restore"" will bless your heart. The students that worked on this CD definitely gave God an Unconditional Praise that will mininster to many across this country. You deserve to buy this product and be blessed by students from the University of Texas Innervisions Gospel Choir."
5,Classic Song,Sade really made a classic with this Sweeping jam from the early 90's.it really has alot of feeling&tone to it.She is a very important Artist who has her own thing.check it out.
5,A real winner!,"This cd is fun, easy listening. With a variety of upbeat tales and instrumentals, there certainly is a song for every French lover on the cd. I appreciated the comments about each song that were listed on the play list included with the cd. I like it alot, recommend it highly."
4,I Love Paris,"Overall, this is a nice CD with many pleasant songs. It always brightens my day after a long day at work. However, I was under the impression that each of these songs were in French, when just over half of them are, causing the 4 instead of a 5."
5,I love Paris:),This is a really good album for people who love Paris and French music I highly reccomend this cd for anyone in love or who just loves music:)
4,Walter Lord never fails to make history come alive.,"Walter Lord takes the most significant historical events of the years 1900-1914, and gives it a human touch that makes you feel that you are there. He reveals volumes in sentences, and never disappoints. From the Boxer Rebellion to eve of World War I, The unique american perspective is well represented."
3,At least worth looking at,"As a professional economist of heterodox views, I have been wondering whether this book is worth buying, especially given that the table of contents seem to indicate a work that is heavily ideologically biased, regardless of the value of the scientific arguments being made against mainstream neoclassicalism. Luckily, I discovered a review in a professional journal, which while pointing out some flaws and mistakes in the book indicate that it is worth reading. (...) I now plan on a purchase."
5,Well Written Critique of the Emperor,"Steve Keen introduces a large variety of refutations to common misconceptions in mainstream economic theory. With chapters structured with an overview of the mainstream view, then the rebuttal, then explanation of the implications, he brings up downward sloping demand curves, the efficient market hypothesis and other trolls and brings up many rebuttals to these notions.Sraffa appears frequently throughout the book, and a good introduction to his monumental Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities is included.For 300 pages, the breadth of the critique is enormous, and there is even a chapter rebutting Marxist thought and a chapter on alternatives.There are certainly some things that I would have liked to be in this book, like growth theory, and the chapter on Keynes could have been expanded to include the synthesism and the Cambridge rebuttals of it.Overall I highly recommend this book to anyone curious about the field of economics in general."
1,not worth the shipping price,"I cant install the fonts and the extra art CDs dont work. I've tried to talk to customer support about it, but they don't know whats going on.Oct19 - 2009This is an update to my review. customer service has been working with me on this over the last couple of months, although it is taking A LONG time, the admin is extremely nice and has tried really hard to solve my problems. Keep in mind that if you have Vista, you will need to move the fonts out of the C program folder in order to install them. Once i solved that, for some reason, other things started to work for me (really not sure why). I still get some error messages, but I am able to read art from the other CDs. Once it started working I found that this is a very valuable program. I really only bought it for the fonts. There is a ton of clip art in here too."
4,Very interesting,The passionate life of Daniel Barenboim. Too bad the version I have is the first edition...
5,Necessary Reference Book,"This is a wonderful book that provides all the information you may need to sate your curiosity about a particular aspect of a band like ""Where are they from?"", When did this album come out?"", ""Was she once in this other band?"". I've been referring to an earlier edition of this rock encyclopedia by Stamler for 20 years! I felt it was time to get the newer edition for more information and it's great too."
4,"Old-fashioned, but informative","A stiff wind from squaresville, this survey comes to us from a writer/editor at ""Rolling Stone""... By definition, that makes its focus fairly mainstream, not that that really detracts much from its value as a reference work (especially considering how snobbish we've gotten about all those bloated, scary AOR bands from the '70s). Some entries seem a bit overlong, and starstruck, but this is a solid reference work."
3,Meh,"The first time I listened to this album I was really excited about it. But each time thereafter I got less excited and now I'm not very excited at all. The first song is fantastic but after that, meh. By the way, meh is the sound I make when something is just okay. I recommend you start saying meh too. In fact, I would rather say meh than listen to many of the songs on this album.The first half of Worlds Apart is alright but the second half sounds like it was written by a different band. All around it's just an average and dare I say disappointing album from a great band.They still rock live though. Last time I saw them they invited everyone on stage to help them completely demolish their instruments."
4,Grand Wizards in Purple Cloaks!,"Possibly this album holds the largest dichotomy of visual art versus sonic art. The music is excellent- the album art could be the worst ever seen. It's like Dungeon and Dragons done with photoshop. The name of the band and name of the album is almost as bad as the cover art. What gives? Just have some normal artwork on the cover, you Grand Wizards in Purple Cloaks! Where are the Multi sided dice?"
4,not to shabby,"this band really surprised me. i admit i am not a seasoned veteran of TOD but i've always ""watched them from afar"" Some of the tracks on this album are excellent, for instance ""Let it Drive"", ""The Rest Will Follow"" and ""Lost City of Refuge"" are all fantastic. They are definitely the most adventurous band i've heard in a long time, but they dont succeed in everything they try. After ""ode to isis"" i expected ""will you smile again for me?"" to make me druel on myself, and don't get me wrong it starts very well, but about half way through the song they kill the guitar the song becomes really boring. The album in general starts out slow but it closes with a string of barn burners. Overall i reccomend this album. Let it Drive will be in your head for weeks."
4,..And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead - Worlds Apart,"With ""Worlds Apart,"" the...Trail of Dead guys have topped their previous works in creativity and replay value. Keely and his compadres leave little to be desired in this riveting, loud, and lyrically intriguing way to start your new year. In exemplary Trail of Dead form, the rockers layer many of their tracks with pianos, violens, and organs, giving Keely's bitter words a tinge of pleasant irony. While a few segments of this album seem a bit too much like filler, the songs that hit the target, hit it awfully hard; making ""Worlds Apart,"" perhaps the most important release of this early year. Check out ""Will You Smile Again,"" and ""Caterwaul.""4/5"
4,TOD or SDRE?,"I'll admit I bought this CD based on a tip from my brother, a few postive reviews I read here and a visit to their website and I must say I think I just became an instant fan. This CD is my only exposure to TOD and I'm very impressed, however, upon my 4th listen tonight I have come to the conclusion that this could have been Sunny Day Real Estate's follow up to The Rising Tide. Hmmmm, I wonder if Jeremy Enigk has heard it and what he thinks? Anyway, whether Jeremy likes it or not isn't the issue. The issue is that this is a remarkable release from a band I previously knew nothing about. What's cool is that I now get to backtrack. I'm looking forward to it."
5,Fantastic from start to finish!,"I'd heard some of Trail's previous stuff online, but hadn't really connected with it. This album is different: cohesive, powerful, funny, emotional. A wild ride from the very start, all the way through. ""Will You Smile Again For Me"" completely blows me away, every time. The wailing and the ""candy store"" chorus refrain at the end of ""The Best"" is a great moment. ""And the Rest Will Follow"" is very Smiths-sounding, and is made for summer road trips. Just get this music, kids..."
3,Trail connects different worlds,3 1/2Unabashed prog-pop power enhances the rough edges around this creamy interior to make an endearing album which offers as many emotional moments as it does head-bashing ones.
4,Almost great,So this band is amazing and this album is pretty good stuff. The album just feels like it has not pinacle. When you listen to some songs you are waiting for it to speed up or start building... but it never comes. Kind of disappointing on that point. The songs are all pretty good just not great.
4,FEELING UNINSPIRED.............,Ive allways appreciated Robert Smith from afar never actually commiting myself to one particular album or another.The Cure just were not my speed.However the more I heard from this cd the more I wanted it so I finally broke down and bought my first Cure cd.I have nothing to comapre it too being that im not a full time fan but in this age of mediocrity it is refreshing to hear something this comfortable and natural sounding.Well done Mr.Smith.
5,TOD's best album to date.,"This album marks a major evolution in the bands music. They still have the attitude, but they've added development. All the songs on here are well developed, Many have multiple distinct movements, multiple bridges, and even multiple time signatures. The production has moved up several notches with more different instrumentation and ambient sounds. You'll hear some of the best alternative rock drumming around songs whipping from odd to even time signatures and back again.In short, it's clear that they put a lot of work into this and I hope to hear more. The band explores a wider range of musical styles than on previous efforts, including classical rock styles reminiscent of Bowie or Pink Floyd. They could have made another ""Source Tags & Codes"" (and you can hear it still there) but everyone would have said that ""their albums all sound alike"". I think they pushed the envelope but in general hit the ball out of the park. More bands need to work as hard as this."
2,What happened to the action and the drawings?,"I am a huge fan of Spider-Man of all the series. I wanted to read this book 'cause it looked cool. I was very disapointed. The drawings were horrible. They all looked like a 14 drew them. Second all there basically was, was talk. No action except at the very beginning and end. If you don't read this book you are not missing much."
2,Unfortunately disappointed,"I am in the process of returning the shoes because two weeks after wearing them, the rubber ""bumpers"" started to pull away from the base of the shoe and then completely split."
4,The Old Style- New Cool,"Nice Shoes, keep it going. Comfortable, Supportive good fit and balance well with my difference forms of styles also forms of wear."
4,En su linea,"It's a nice CD, most of the songs are great, like always. Not many bands can keep playing for so long and still get to play such good music. If you like them you're definetely gonna like this album!"
5,"Ten years later, and I still play the hell out of this disk","Why has this record stayed with me in a way so few others have? Because the music betrays an almost casual intelligence that never stops penetrating? Is it the weird juxtaposition of gloriously hopeful music subverted by self-destructive lyrics? Or is it merely that it's one of the great rock and roll records of the last ten years? All three, and more. Buy it, play it, enjoy."
3,"A collection of short, non-philosophical and ad hoc excerpts","In the scholarly debate about the existence of fascist doctrine, Griffin takes the stance that such a doctrine did not exist. This position makes him very inclusive in recognizing almost any ultra-nationalist movement as ""fascist"". It also dictates the very unphilosophical character of most of his selections: Most of them are ad-hoc speeches or short columnist pieces, focused on or evoked by current events, that express the ideas of their authors in vehement and excited slogans rather than in discursive, abstract argumentation.One may claim: That is the true fascist talk. But I disagree. Some fascist thinkers, like Gentile and Panunzio, certainly had philosophical argumentations, and saw themselves as spokesmen of a well-ordered political philosophy. A good book ought to give room for this type of works, too.The book may be very useful for history students - not for anyone who seeks an honest and sine ira presentation of fascist thought."
5,A confirmed classic,"The real test of any great rock album is how it sounds, 5, 10, or 30 years after its release. It has been over five full years since this one was released. After giving it a listen for the first time in over 2 years, I have to say that this one is still great. It has the same effect it had on me back in 1994, so it must be a great album. Possibly the best CD released by the Pumpkins."
5,Awesome-maybe one of their best,"If you like Gish and Siamese Dream you'll love Pisces Iscariot. I honestly don't know how these got rejected. Pissant is a fast-paced punk style song unlike anything I've heard by them. Frail and Bedazzled, Plume, and Hello Kitty Kat are classic Pumpkins songs. Blew Away is a James I'ha song, but this one doesn't suck. The liner notes are cool too. They tell the stories of a lot of the songs' origins. I completely recommend this CD to anyone who longs for the Pumpkins early years to return(and I've heard they are for their next album)."
5,their best album ever(and its not a real album),pisces iscariot is a colletion of b-sides from the pumpkins first singles and studio albums .simply if you like the pumpkins youll love it.if you dont own a disc from them yet buy this one.
4,"Pisces Iscariot, Smashing Pumpkins","This album is so often overlooked and swept in the shadows of the Pumpkins anthology, and it is a shame. This is a more stripped down album compared to more extravagant productions like Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie, but at its core, it is still just undeniably good music. There is more of an acoustic touch to this album, and a more airy feeling throughout, with not as many heavy, raging tunes. Even the harder-edged songs (pissant, hello kitty kat) seem to have a soaring quality in the context of this album. However, the more acoustic songs demonstrate the softer side of the pumpkins, from the simple, yearning, ""Soothe"", to the lilting ""Whir"", to the hauntingly beautiful ""Obscured"". Either way, this album has a definite overall texture to it, one that is both ethereal and tangible. Very good stuff. Give it a try."
5,never found a better B-side,"other bands arn't fit to wipe [the floor]. a masterpiece of music. sure, no great hits but alot of awesme meaningful lyrics like from the song BLUE and Starla. my only complaint is the length of Starla, a great beginning but after a while the guitar wails and grind get annoying"
5,Picses Iscariot,"Picese is a great album featuring the songs that did not make it on siamese. I would highly recommend this album, it gives you a unique look at the pumpkins while still fitting in with the Siamese Dream Motif. SOme great songs are (Just to name a few) Frail and bedazzled, a rock song and Spaced, an obscure song featuring steel or slide guitar."
5,Great release from the best band of the 90's,"Most bands don't even approach this with their A material. Billy Corgan is a musical genious with James Iha being quietly great along side. This collection contains several great soothing tunes like ""Blew Away"" ""Hello Kitty Kat"" ""Soothe"" and my personal favorite ""Whir"" which sounds incredible on a good stereo along with several others. Included with the soothers are only two rockers ""Frail and Bedazzled"" which is one of the best power tunes from the band and ""Plume"". The rest are lighter tunes and all are great. The only one here that I don't care for is ""Girl Named Sandoz"" but some may like it. If you are new to the band grab it along with Siamese and Melancholy and if you are already a Pumkins fan it is a must. And I guess you can't forget Gish - just get all of the releases they are all unique and conatain some great stuff."
4,"Oddly enough; I like it more than ""Siamese Dream""","Forget all the jazz about this being just a collection of B-Sides and rejects. PI is GREAT! It has the wrenching acoustic ""Soothe"" and ""Landlside"", the almost sappy/happy ""Whir"", the teeth wrenched grunge festivals of ""Pissant"" and ""Girl Named Sandoz"", and the almost pyschedelic ""Spaced"", to spotlight a few. Oh, and don't forget ""Starla"", ONE OF THE BEST of all Pumpkin's songs. This CD finds it's way into my player a whole lot more than the much hyped ""Siamese Dream"", so just listen to it already and make up your own mind! [ ; )"
3,Very Much a Mixed Bag,"Basically a bunch of B-sides, and it shows. Some of the songs are quite good -- James Iha's (the George Harrison of the Pumpkins) ""Blew Away,"" is memorable and affecting, and the cover of ""Landslide"" is neat in a slightly off-kilter way -- but the album as a whole really doesn't cohere. The chaff blends together very quickly, and few of the weaker songs stand out in any way: some drums, some growling guitar, some Billy Corgan whingeing, and neither the individual elements nor the overall package offers much new. Most of the second half of the album is this way, although Starla is an interesting standout, with a real sense of depth, beauty, and energy."
4,They are still very good,"""Landslide"", even though not their song, is the best on the album. You need to buy it if you a rock fan, but this is not for everyone. Some songs are a little bit dull, but the instrumentation is wonderful."
5,a great b-sides,"This album is great if you, don't just like the pumkins, but love them. For those of you who think they pumkins are ok, don't bother, but to those of you who love the pumkins this CD is great. IT is not a must have, it is a b-side and nothing more. Must haves are siamese dream and mellon collie. THis is just to enjoy."
3,"Not the best, but it's still SP.","I'll just say it's not their best album, but it's still good, as it is still Smashing Pumpkins after all. However, any fan of SP should still get this album."
2,Not the Pumpkins finest hour,"I'm a huge fan of the Smashing Pumpkins (I have all of their other albums and for the most part really enjoy them), but this did not live up to my expectations. The album is filed with a bunch of songs that didn't quite make it to cd previously, and probably shouldn't have made it to this one. Besides their cover of Landslide, and maybe one or two others, I probably won't be giving this a listen again anytime soon."
2,sadly it's their weakest album,"Filling the whole album with outtakes from ""Gish"" and ""siamese dream"" could be a great idea but the songs from here are lacking of originality and their specific energy.there are good songs like dark and creepy ""soothe"",""Landslide"" and ""Obscured"",""Hello kity kat"" rocks like nothing before but it is a bit to less to give it 3 stars.these songs from album are leaving you wanting more but there is nothing more really.unfinished songs,jams and nothing really important for standard rock fan although Pumpkins fans will buy it anyway."
2,"great for music, but not for laptop or TV","I thought I had seen other reviews of this headset that said the same thing -This headset is well-designed and comfortable, but if you are using them to watch TV or movies, if the sound drops below a certain level, the headset sound cuts out. That means that most dialogue without background music is not audible.I returned my first pair and got another, just in case the originals were defective, but the second pair did the same thing.So if you want these to listen to music they're great, but not good for anything with variable decibel levels."
1,How can it not work ?,"Something was wrong with my cables.. seems like a loose connection etcI needed a male to male RCA adaptor for connecting my DAC to my AMP, this seemed the perfect length..but Im surprisd how such a simple thing can go wrong."
4,Does What It's Supposed to Do,I've always been a little suspicious of the simple metal jumpers that come standard with a pre-amp/receiver. This is a nice upgrade. I can't really tell a difference after the switch but no matter--I wanted it and now I have it. :-)
3,mediocre,"If you look at the picture on the cover, you can probably figure out everything that is on the tape. I think I paid $40 for this, so I was somewhat disappointed."
5,"Best cowbell, bar none?","I've played different cowbells. This is my favorite. There is also a LP008 with a red plastic striking bar, that has a different pitch. I like the pitch of the LP009 better for what I play....lower level acoustic sets, praise and worship music in churches and prisons. If I was just in rock and louder music, I might prefer the red striking bar LP008 better."
2,Rather dull account of being gay in government,"One thing becomes clear very early on when reading this book.Lance Price sees his sexuality as more important and interesting that anything he may reveal in this rather dull 'diary'.Lance Price needed an angle other than ""I am going to write about my time at No.10"" and so decided to call it a diary. Problem is - who ever wrote a diary reminding themselves about their and others sexuality on nearly every page?This is a vague attempt to recreate a diary that apparently was written at the time. However you will quickly realize that it is less revealing and more about a man who is impressed with the position he once filled.After reading this book you will probably be reminded of the 'Prime Minister' sketch in the BBC comedy 'Little Britain'."
3,"Very cute, but more for show than for warmth","I got this hat to match a coat I bought, and they looked great together, I got some gorgeous pictures of my daughter with the set, but the hat does not cover the ears well and it is not a very snug fit (I got size 12-18 and my daughter wore this hat when she was 18 months, not 12, she also is in the 60th percentile in head circumference, so she's not below average). Definitely would not recommend it as an every day hat for colder climates (seems too winter-looking to be worn in spring or fall there, too), but I guess it can work for the South. Cute hat, but I probably would not have purchased this hat for a full price had I tried it on in the store. Maybe on a good sale."
3,microwave,"microwave door busted on shipment, return and replacement was quick. Replacement did not work, covered under warrenty but had to take to a Sharp servicer for repair."
2,Display dies after 1 year!,"What a NOT sharp Sharp. Exactly one year after purchase, half the digital display stops working. So, can't read the time, can't see how much time you entered...just have to count the beeps as you push each button to know what you are entering. Granted, it lasted another 7 years, but we were not happy with the early display dying. Smoked and flashed electricity inside as it died an ugly death."
5,Great Little Microwave,"I've only had it for about 2 months, but it works like a dream. I especially like the Rice function. Makes perfect rice if you follow the easy directions. I'd buy this microwave again."
1,no real storyline just another counting book,"If it weren't for the absolutely charming characters/illustrations that our kids know from the other ""Click Clack"" books, this boook would have no appeal whatsoever. The other books show the delightful author's wit and humor. This book's limited subject material (counting 1 to 10) just didn't give her enough opportunity."
4,"Fun, with a dash of frustration","For people that are looking for a game which will take longer than an hour or so to beat and love animals, this is your game.The tutorial levels can be quite tedious until you get a handle on the camera controls and terrain editor. However, they are good preparation for the levels ahead, and I would suggest completing them to optimize your zoo in the free play mode.I found that when you become very adept at creating a happy environment for the animals they are VERY quick to procreate, and before you know it you have a small exhibit with a large quantity of animals.When using the terrain editor to create hills/mountains or valleys/bodies of water, it is difficult to tell how much you are affecting the selected land.Once you become confident in your skills, you can really have fun with it without frustration. All-in-all, a good game."
2,No comparison to Roller Coaster/Zoo tycoon games,"If you have played the Roller Coaster and Zoo typcoon games I feel you will be quite disappointed with Zoo Empire by Enlight. Not only is it totally different but you better study your instruction booklet before playing and be prepared to refer to it constantly.I found it frustrating trying to manuver through the toolbar which is far from simple just to get to the sections sections needed to make the game run smoothly.. The layout is (for lack of a better word) strange!!Well, maybe the youngsters will have an easier time of it, but I doubt it. Its simply a frustration to play..Personally disappointed."
3,Frustrating...,"Though I would never compare this game to RollerCoaster Tycoon, because that is far and away the best game of this type out there, Zoo Empire certainly doesn't stand on its own. The learning curve is HUGE! I had to pick up the manual constantly even though I patiently went through all the tutorials. This game gave me no joy and a lot of headaches. The animals were hungry within 15 seconds of having fed them. Vending machines were vandalized, but heck if you could figure out which ones. The objectives were very demanding, to say the least.The upside of this game were the graphics, which were awesome. Plus, you could view your zoo from just about any camera angle you desire. It's obvious that this is a quality-made game. Unfortunately, the gameplay is not the least bit relaxing or fun. I really wanted to like this game!"
4,Great Fun!,"Zoo empire is not rollercoaster tycoon, and comparing the two is like comparing apples and oranges. There are many wonderful things included in the game. First of all, the engine that zoo empire running on, that allows the user controls is great! It is so fabulous to be able to right click to move up down all around and see the park from any view. (I was playing wildlife park prior to purchasing this game, and can never go back to it, simply for this fact- manuvering in your game is simple and flawless!) The colors, details, graphics, and wide range of animal interactions are all stunning!AI-wise, the visitor complaints really need to be looked in: the second I open my park, people immediately begin complaining about broken items. However, this is a minor point and does not really detract from the pleasure of building wild-and-wacky exhibits.Overall, a really fun game and much better than wildlife park."
2,Get something similar if you buy the scissor jig,If you buy the scissor jig you get something similar but it's covered with a teflon like material. I like it better than the tool rest.
4,Tool Rest review,This tool rest will not store in the drawer of the sharpener without removing the screw. It works fine.
2,Don't hold under pressure,"I bought this jig mainly to sharpen the edge of cabinet scraper as described in the DVD.This is just a waste of money. It doesn't matter how tight I I turn the knob, applying a little pressure on the tool rest change its angle.This is the only jig that comes with the JET sharpener that I have tested and that just isn't worse it."
4,A Tricky Thriller,"You will enjoy reading it;because, nothing happens as you expect it to. I thought I knew the predictable storyline, so I presumptuously guessed what would happen throughout this book and kept drawing the wrong conclusions each time. As with 'The Sentinel', the ending of this novella is gonna' get ya'."
5,Drill Bit,What can you really say about a drill bit. It makes a really good round hole. Watch out for your fingers because it is sharp.
4,Actual Quotes From His Books,"What is best about this DVD is that character of C.S. Lewis protrayed said exactly what C.S. Lewis would say, because they were word for word quotes from his books, mostly from his autobiographySurprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Lifepublished by C. S. Lewis in 1955.The worst about this DVD was the very distracting artificial flickering from an unseen fireplace while Lewis was chatting in his armchair in his living room."
3,CS Lewis Beyond Narnia,"This story appeared to be made by non-Christian director/producer since CS Lewis' Christian faith was not shown from Christian view. This product may be targeted for non-Christians. I was looking for CS Lewis' Christian life story; how he was converted, what experience made him converted etc. How he was moved as he was writing Narnia story.So it was disappointing."
1,Another waste of money,"Unless you are a Narnia freak, this is a pure waste of money. I would suggest sticking to the movies."
5,"Food, Inc.","Food, Inc. will IMMEDIATELY change the way you eat. A MUST purchase - especially if you have children or grandchildren."
5,Must see!,This is a must see to better your awareness about the food you are putting in your body. It is a eye opening fact about our food revolution. It has changed my view on food---I am going organic for sure!!!
2,Pseudo Science!,"Nothing but testimonials and no scientific backing at all. No double blind studies, and the evidence presented has been refuted by reputable scientists. So I am sorry if you watch this movie expecting to confirming your already biased opinions look elsewhere. Look it up, study it not everything in this documentary is wrong but some of the evidence presented has already been been refuted. Dig deeper and make sure your sources are from non-biased sources. You will find that many of the claims in the movie are just flat out unjustified by real science. Now don't get me wrong I hate big corporations, but I just not going to buy into claims that are not factually justified."
2,Important Topic in a Boring Film,"This film was extremely disappointing. I was hoping for a clear, riveting summary of the environmental and health problems created because of the food industry in this country. I wanted an exposition of the inhumane techniques used to raise animals, the government policies and subsidies that contribute to the system, and the alternatives. The filmmaker touched on these points, but I didn't feel they were clearly made (read Michael Pollen's The Omnivore's Dilemma instead). Many of the people interviewed in the film are inarticulate and hence boring to listen to, and the pacing is very slow. If I wasn't already a ""true believer,"" this film would not have convinced me of the problem."
1,biased,"this movie has a radical left wing agenda. it portrays modern day unions as saving the modern day worker and customers of food products. the film also lobbies for illegal immigrants and paints the typical ""evil corporations"" as the source of all of humanities problems. it does have unbiased truth here and there, but if your smart, you will see that most of the movie is opinion based from a few facts. i gave it one star, as i don't like read or watch anything i can see a political bias in."
1,Not worth the time for a review,"Wow. What a terrible, terrible ""documentary."" Completely one sided and the only word that kept coming to my mind was ""duh"" while watching this craptacular movie.Zero stars."
1,Left Wing Propaganda,"I wanted to like this, and watched about 40 minutes. But, when it became transparently evident that this docudrama would be for the most part totally one-sided agi-prop of business = bad, vs. any sense of balance that there are good things thathave come of changes in food production, I just stopped watching. Really a bunch of do-gooder libby libs that see no value in more efficient food production that allows us to eat a wider variety of foods more cheaply. If they had their way, we would still have the butter churn and we could all eat a sandwich for $37.50 --- but boy the one sandwich a month we could afford to eat would be oh so organic. What a bunch of crap this movie is!!!"
5,Eat right !!! This movie will help you !,"This movie is absolutely eye opening. Never before did I look at lables or where what came from, as much as after watching this movie.Now I am eating better food. I feel more energetic and healthier, and all thanks to this movie !Thank you to the people tho made it, you helped me improve mine and my family's life !Everyone you care about should watch this !!"
3,"Oh, Wow!","I really wanted to see this DVD - and when it came FREE with my Amazon Prime account - I couldn't wait! It left a LOT to be desired1 I was wanting a more in depth documentary than what I found! It opened my eyes to a lot of things - but failed in really being able to deliver the ""HUMPH"" in WHY we shouldn't be eating WHAT we are eating!3 Stars because I expected a lot more ""bang for the buck"" due to the reviews - but didn't find the depth of what I was searching for."
1,Disappointing! A nonsubjective viewer is suggested,This film was a disappiontment for one basic reason it was short on detailed facts and long on dramatics. I was constantly waiting for details that would never come. This film tries to persuade the audience with emotion instead of facts and statistics. I appreciate the need for natural food and hope that some day all that want it can get it. However the current methods feed millions/billions that would not be fed otherwise and this film does not address this issue. Sometimes people forget there is 7 billion of us that need to eat every day. This film does not advance the front on educating society....................................Unless someone is completely clueless about where there food comes from and how its made. Then it could offer a kernel of infomation but suggest people look into this serious topic with much more detail outside this film.
3,nice documentary but I've seen Better,Not the best documentary I have seen on this topic but it was still well produced and informative. I liked the footage of factory farming the most. I wish it hadn't tried to cover so many topics because it meant that no one topic was explored adequately.
4,documentary,"great educational video, was looking for something that the mainstream media doesn't cover. the video has helped me to make some changes for the positive. I would recommend watching it again to refresh"
4,Food Inc.,This was an interesting look at the food industry and the kind of control large corporations have over farmers and the entire industry.
4,"food, inc","interesting, but slanted. Basically, think about what you're eating and where its coming from.....grow your own. Very easy to rent the movie...eeasily and readily available."
5,Where's the Beef?,"As a college instructor at the University of Phoenix in San Antonio, Texas, this video has helped me to illustrate ""the other side"" of the food production industry. It is highly informative, very graphic, and captivating for students of all ages."
5,Food health 2,I recommend all people to view this DVD.We all have an idea that the western/American diet or way of eating might not be so great for us; but watching this helps bring those ideas more clearly into focus.
5,what you can do,start a grass root movement to bring the bad practices to a stop. show this movie to any church group and club that you can.
5,"Excellent, engaging, essential documentary","Food, Inc., a well-documented account of the state of the food supply in the U.S.A. is thoroughly engaging and highly informative. What I liked best was the balanced, practical common-sense approach and attitude presented - one of the first scenes has Michael Pollan eating and enjoying a burger. Watching this has influenced the choices I make when feeding my family. You realize that cheap, subsidized, processed food comes at too high a price for our health, the environment, the welfare of animals, and even farmers. Everyone should view this excellent film."
5,"Food, Inc.is an Awesome Documentary","If one cares about what they eat, then this DVD is solid GOLD. We as people must consider the ultimate consequences of letting others control our life. This DVD is an eye opening experience and is not for the faint at heart. It is hard to keep a dry eye, especially over a small child's death. A must see for anyone concerned about what they eat and the future of our food supply!"
4,must see,"This dvd opened my eyes to a lot of practices in the food industry such as the possibility of having up 1,000 different cows in a single hamburger patty. I quickly stopped letting my child eat certain foods after seeing what the mother on this film went through. It helped me make better decisions about food quality and I plan to watch it every now and then to remind me of why I don't eat certain food anymore. I would have given it 5 stars if it were a little faster in its delivery and they probably could've gotten a lot more intense footage if they let people and locations remain confidential. That way we might have been able to go inside chicken houses, etc and people not get let out of their contracts as a result. Overall, great film!"
5,"Food, Inc.",This movie is super informative about food safety and the American diet. I got a lot of information out of it and have changed my eating habits because of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone and have recommended it to many.
5,I WILL MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES,"After watching this film, I WILL MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES. I WILL DO THE RESEARCH. I will not contribute to the problem any longer. I hope you will do the same."
3,Eyes Not Open,"After reading the reviews for this movie, I decided to give it a go. Eyes closed, I sat down for the complete 94 minutes that the movie lasted only to be left disappointed- my eyes did not open. Perhaps it was a server-side issue, but whatever the case, be aware of faulty reviews.It sounded pretty good, however. Lots of good info"
5,Must watch,I had no idea about where my food came from or why it mattered before watching this. Very educational and entertaining.
5,Everyone Needs to See This One!,"If I ever thought about making some serious changes in my food choices, this film answered all my questions. This is truly a must-see for everyone. One of the things we know very little about is where our food comes from. It is an important thing to include in our knowledge. This film will do that."
4,Every one must see.,"Great documentary, if this film does not open your eyes to what is in our food nothing will."
5,amazing documentary!,"This movie is a must watch for every person in the usa. I really didn't understand how much our supermarkets have changed in the last 50 years. If you want your eyes opened WIDE to the truth then watch this film. I have loaned it out to everyone I care about, because to be ignorant is dangerous. I've had an allergy to beef for the last 15 years and never knew why. I am buying grass fed beef now and have yet to have any reaction, which tells me its not beef but maybe the hormones or antibiotics or the ammonia they wash the beef in or maybe the dye they use to make it look red. If you care about your health and the future of our country this is a must purchase."
4,the real story,"Great documentary that everyone who puts food into their mouths should see. A truly honest, humane look at an inhumane and deceitful industry. This should be required viewing in every middle school to help open young minds to harsh realities and let them make an informed decision on what they eat. Of course, this will never happen due to the control that the mega food industry wields. It's a wonder we can still buy this film."
4,food inc.,"Really makes you think but, if you think too much, you'll never eat again --- really need to research how our food is processed and be much more aware of how animals are being treated ---- very sad."
5,change your life!,"Great flick! Amazing life changes & people helping others. Awareness & helplessness, sad, uplifting, and mostly life changing. I purchased a juicer & love it!"
5,Eye opener,This is a must see. A real eye opener on the food industry. It definitely makes you want to reconsider what you pull off the shelf when you're shopping.
4,Worth watching,Makes you think about what you are eating. Our son was assigned this to watch and review.The whole family watched together.Glad we did.
5,We can change things,"I definitely will begin paying more for clean meat. We have cut our consumption to only one meal a day. I was already buying chicken that was not Tyson but finding grass fed beef is a bit harder and rather expensive. I will probably just minimize all beef I buy and do more ""healthy chicken"" and fish. I ask in restaurants if beef is grass fed (and it never is) and then I order chicken or fish."
4,Well done expose,Makes you really think about food protection and want to do something about it. Hope others get to see this and want to act
5,5 stars,This film is very informative about the sources of our food and the way the food market it manipulated by the government.
4,Great movie to enable the activist in us all,"While there are some slight faults with the movie, overall it is a great documentary to show where America really is at with food...and it is eye-opening. We are what we eat, and where the food industry is at today cannot be ignored with where health is nationwide as well.Some might struggle through parts of the movie that show animal cruelty, but people need to be enlightened to what is going on.Finally, what I live about this movie is there is hope. There are a ton of doom and gloom documentaries out there that leave you with a sense of hopelessness, by we consumers have the power."
4,Very informative,This movie is a very good documentary. If you haven't seen it already you should. I really enjoyed it. Made me think about what I eat.
5,Loved it,"I thought this was done well, kept me interested and changed the way I buy my food. Although, I am not perfect; I think about what I am buying before I place it in my cart. It has been one month since I watched the movie and the changes I have made not only make me feel better, it is helping my pant size and hopefully will help change the industry. If you like this movie, I would also reccomend watching the future of food."
4,Very informative,Makes you think twice about what you are eating.We get grass fed beef at home and I am very thankful for that.
1,Inaccurate,"Lies, lies and more lies. How this guy is considered a documentarian and not a fantasy director I will never understand"
2,A crash course into food snobbery.,"Though there is some shock value in this film, do not forget this film is made to entertain and to boost book sells by the author Pollan. Instead of refusing to eat off plate not made of gold, it seems Pollan refuses to eat anything not grass-fed. I can see him pointing his nose up in the sky and saying, ""Nope, I won't eat it, it has to be labeled 100% organic.Hmmm, to be shamed by the elite because of where you get your food, or even which food to eat is almost like a nightmarish sci-fi movie. Pollan sure goes out of his way shame the lower-class laborers by telling them they are not eating the right foods. A (possibly migrating) family arrives in America only to be harassed by food snobs, where these snobs also obscurely mock people about weight control.This movie does not have any beneficial standpoints on how to change the standards to govern food safety."
2,"Great documentary, bad product","The documentary is amazing. I had to return the product, however due to the inability to play the DVD more than once. I tried on several players and it would not read."
3,Food Inc.,"Food Inc was a pretty good flick. I personally got a little bored with it. I think the movie ""Supersize Me"" was slightly better. It's definitely worth watching though and very informative/ accurate in the way corporations deliver food to america."
3,"Interesting, but too slow","This is a topic I am very interested in and wanted my family to see, however this dvd is so insanely slow and boring that I have not been able to watch it thru to the end yet. My kids walked away very early on as did my husband. Its an important topic, and I am not criticizing that, its just simply way too slow and you wind up drifing off."
4,Every American Must Watch,Definitely a movie that every American should watch and be better educated about the process of food in the America economy.
5,The Truth is Out at Last,"This movie gives a comprehensive understanding of the BIG AGRI BUSINESS machine and how it ruins our human qualities and the sacredness of life. Food, health, honesty, animals and people manipulated for the sake of money. It is cruelty to animals and ultimately cruelty to humanity. Hope is there though in the farmers and people who refuse to operate under this AGRI DICTATORSHIP. You must see this and share it with everyone. LB, Richmond Hill, ON"
5,Food Inc..... Will this change how you eat?,"I found this movie very informational and totally worth the purchase. Lend it to your friends, co-workers, family members. Total inside look at how our food industry operates. Obviously as you will see its all about how much money people make in the industry & they farmers dont get hardly anything for all the hard work they put into it."
5,Great Product and Transaction,"I love this documentary, opens your eyes to what the industry has been doing for a long time and what one can do to help many better yet what MANY can do to help one, the one (figuratively speaking about the collective group of people) that is causing all this controversy"
5,Food Inc.,The documentary was powerful and eye opening to how America's food sources and processing is frankly harmful to American's. Everyone should see this movie and then begin to make lifestyle choices toward a healthier life which will mean choosing to grow and eat fresh foods and eliminate fast food and processed foods.
5,Foos Inc,"Everyone needs to see Food Inc. Especially, if you like to eat what is good for you and have some empathy for animals."
5,"I'll never take food for granted again, thanks Eric","An eye opening shocker of a film, that RIPS back the veil of secrecy and lies of the food industry. I was woke up to the underlying handling and growth of the food conglomerate industry.A MUST SEE...A little graphic, but REAL!!!! Life Changing Film!!!"
5,"Excellent Movie, A must watch","A must see DVD, An eye opener, One Movie that makes you think twice about the food you eat and WHY?"
3,Insightful,Very nice documentary. I encourage all to watch it. You might learn something about the food industry that you never did before.
5,Must See,"When you buy your next fast food burger or chicken meal you may think twice about biting into it, knowing how it was breed just for you. The concentration of so much power in so little a group is troubling.You can only vote with your eating habits on this one and there's not much to choose from. The future doesn't look bright unless we can change."
5,You'll Never Look at Food the Same Way!!!,"Some of the segments make you disgusted, but it is very enlightening. Worth the watch!"
5,You are what you eat,"This is an amazing documentary that will educate you about something very basic, something that you do at least once a day, eat. The authors tell and show your where the food that most of us eat every day is coming from. Be egoistic an watch this documentary because there is nothing as intimate as eating."
5,Very Well Done!,"Very educational and well put together documentary. Really touches basics on how and why our food industry does what it does and how they become the winners; while us, wanting to eat 'real, organic, natural from nature' foods are the losers who have to continue to fight against a main-stream money making industry where profit is the highest gain, not our health. Watched it on Net-Flix a few times. I always buy organic and raw and support our smaller growers because of the added health benefits and hopes they will be able to compete more effectively with the top conglomerates who rule in food manufacturing."
5,You will lose your appetite,"Food Inc does a great job of exposing several things:Where your food comes from and why you should careWhat the animals go throughWhat it can do to your bodyHow it's hurting the farmersWho is profiting from it all.It's very multidimensional. Rather than just focusing on how certain food is bad for you, but it also focuses on how it got there, and who is suffering.Long story short: it will send you to the farmer's market and organic section every time. It's a shame that many people can't afford the extra cost involved with doing so.A movie that will knock you off your foundation and change the way you eat."
5,"Food, Inc. is a ""must see"" Documentary -- A life changer","This is a fabulous Movie, and it is certain to change your life. This documentary explains some of the reasons not previously disclosed for our national problems with weight gain. This shows how apparently up to 90% of our soybeans are controlled by a chemical company, and are apparently sprayed with roundup as they grow. We need to understand what is happening with the food supply, and how it affects us as well as the animals and crops. Excellent. The realistic parts are tough showing actual animals but those parts are short. See the entire film and you will make changes in your life for the better."
1,Bursting With The Usual Liberal Prejudices,"The movie presents as bad things: the USA, oil, the military, carbon, meat, coal, cars, corporations, profits, banks... However, according to the movie there are a few good things: beans, rice, PETA, walking, very small farms, no profits, lots of free things... Watch this movie to see how really stupid the extreme left gets."
5,Food Inc. (the dvd),I think everyone in America should see this movie. It wassuch a shock to see how only 4 companies control thefood that is produced in the United States and how greedy theyare and how they don't care if we get sick from the food theyproduce.The movie was very well done and I hope more people watch it andmaybe speak out on the behalf of the American public.
5,A real eye-opener!,I only eat Organic beef since I saw this DVD. It almost turned me into a vegetarian or vegan. My dtr is a vegan and turned me onto this DVD.
4,Can't wait to view it,"Product arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. However, I have not had time to view it as yet."
2,Not much,I didn't hear too much in this documentary. It was obviously biased without actually giving a clue as to what their motive was. They tried to make a point very unconvincingly.
2,Completely one-sided,"Food, Inc. gets two starts because it was an entertaining yarn. However, it presents a small fraction the information needed to give the viewer a complete picture of an enormous industry. It doesn't even make any apologies for it. Worse yet, what is presented as fact is most often opinion.I don't know when it became commonplace for documentaries to be so one-sided, but the trend has ruined the genre for me. I assume it started with Michael Moore, but who really cares. Not a single time in this show did the director have anyone present a dissenting opinion.Unless you are just looking for some material to support your opinion that the food industry is the embodiment of evil (with the exception of small organic farmers who are akin to saints), I would pass on this if I were you."
3,very informative but too much info,This is a very informative dvd but too long I fell a sleep a couple of times and had to rewind
1,"Biased, Non-Factbased","Though I support slow food and buying from local producers, I also understand the important role corporations play in agriculture production, marketing and the international food supply. Furthermore, I believe corporations can not be demonized if they are simply doing what we as consumer demand of them. If consumers continue to demand higher quality at a lower price, more uniformity in product and longer periods of shelf stability then these corporations will not change but continue to vertically integrate, engineer and streamline production.Watch the movie but don't take it as absolute truth. A little more reading will be necessary to produce a well-rounded and adequately informed opinion on the subject. Check out this website: [...]. It provides perspective from highly respected research professors and industry professionals."
2,Very easy to talk smack if you have the money..,"I understand that if you have money to eat all organic food you should do it; it's our responsability to try to eat healthy and big companies to tell us what are we eating.In the other hand, if we stop the former way of producing food, and we do it how we used to do it in 1950's we can only feed 1/3 of the human population, i can't see 4 billion people dying..try to change the way YOU eat don't bother other people, because if you don't know what is hunger, disease or starvation keep you opinions to yourself...Norman Borlaug thank you so much for saving a billion lives (yes! a BILLION! A WHOLE BILLION!), while the producers of this mockumentary saved....how many?"
4,It could have been more in detail,"I really like the fact that all of this nation, is tired of the government trying to take control of everything.The country that controls the food controls the world. That is what they are doing here in this country.I was sickened by the way they treated the Chickens, and Pigs, and Cows. The way they treated there workers is just the greatest sadness of all!!!!"
5,Very informative,Not a 5 star for WOW! what a great movie get out the popcorn but for the information that needs to spread to the public! Thank you for enlightening us. We need more non-biased information to make informed decisons based on the TRUTH. Watch It!!!
3,Thought Provoking,"The movie exposes the extreme vulnerability of our food to diseases and bacteria. The bulk of the movie was spent on the beef, pork, poultry industries and only 30 minutes or so was spent on the produce side of food supply, then it was primarily the corn and soy bean industries and how Monsanto has taken control of these markets.I recomend that everyone see this movie and demand a better, safer product from the industry leaders. I really would have liked to seen more coverage on the vegetables we consume regarding their seed to table life and how they are handled. Lately there seems to be a lot more contamination issues in the produce industry."
4,People should watch this . . . but take it with a grain of salt.,"I enjoyed this film, although ""enjoyed"" seems wrong when I was on the point of horror for much of it. The film is well-made and persuasive (which is why I give it four stars), although a bit one-sided (which is why I didn't give it five stars). It was very informative, though, and by the end, I was all ready to jump on their bandwagon. But, I like to research the opposing views before making my decisions, so I went to the one-star reviews - and they actually make some good points. While I agree with much of this film's arguments, I think it serves best as a starting point for discussion. So I recommend the film - I think it's right for people to learn more about where their food comes from - but I caution against accepting everything the filmmakers say without looking at opposing views first. (This is a good stand to take on any issue, of course.)"
5,Excellent film.,Pretty much sums up what I had already suspected but did not have any evidence for.Now I have something to point to when I happen to get into a discussion about food!
4,An informative look at where our food comes from,"I thought this movie was a really informative look at where our food comes from. I went into it with an open mind, and I felt like I learned a lot. Parts of it were tough to watch, and I teared up more than once. This has definitely made me think about my food choices going forward."
5,Only watch this if you plan to change your eating habits~,"I have researched the food industry and knew about the sloppiness of the FDA and its love affair with corporate farming. However, even I was appalled at what this documentary uncovered. If you think the government polices the food industry you really should watch this video. And then go out and buy from your local farmers, and vote to protect their rights to grow and sell food without onerous government meddling."
4,Couldn't watch the whole thing,I couldn't watch it all because of all of the killing in it. But it is a good movie to let everyone know where food is coming from and that all that corn in the food is causing issues. Watching this movie makes me glad to be a long-time vegetarian.
4,Amazing documentary,"This film is extremely informative, fair balanced and enlightening. It's a must see. Educates on where our food comes from and most certainly will cause you to think about what you purchase for your table. An extraordinary film!"
4,"Food, Inc.","The Food, Inc. story is interesting and insightful but only tells part of the story. It is certainly something people need to know. I have a bison ranch in Colorado and raise totally grass-fed bison so I have been aware of the issues with the Corporate feedlots. I am glad to see more and more people becoming concerned about their health and about the food they eat."
5,5 Star Must-See,"The other reviewers say it all, the public must see this film. I'm a vegetarian and this says why (it's also a healthier lifestyle, visit [...])"
5,important informative movie,"We learned so much about what is going on in the food industry from this movie.The chemicals in other types of food have been turning us into organic shoppers, this just did it for the meat."
4,Exhaustive Movie on the Current State of Food Production,"""Food, Inc."" is a very interesting documentary that examines the current state of mass-produced food in today's society. We eat every day, but do we really know where our food comes from? This movie explores how government supported mass-produced food is making us all less healthy, in addition to negatively impacting our environment and the animals that become our hamburgers, sandwiches, and steaks. It's an exhaustive (but not exhausting) documentary that should be viewed by everyone. My only complaint is that the movie could have been edited a little bit, as it got a tad long in the end.If you enjoy this movie, I strongly recommend that you readFast Food Nation. This fascinating book details how today's fast food marketplace is corrupt and destroying people's lives, in more ways than you may know. McDonald's is the main culprit here. Strongly recommended."
5,great dvd,"saw this first from the library, then bought it here so we could have a copy as a reference, and to show our kids as part of homeschooling...so they will be aware of what is out there...great dvd"
3,DVD Food Inc,"Very left wing view of what's happening...so some of the blame game is a little far fetched...this problem didn't happen in just the last 10 years. But the info, descriptions and processes that are ACTUALLY filmed are alarming, and needs to be brought to the public."
2,too slow,I had heard it would change the way I looked at food. I got 1 hour into it and quit watching it. I thought it was boring and not that mind-blowing.
1,One sided,"This is the typical the 'sky is falling' and 'we are all going to die' documentary. Its intent is to shock you into eating organic and purchasing from local markets only. Of course buying local is better for you. Of course not ingesting pesticides is healthier. There are no REAL steps for solving the problem, nothing that you could grab onto and move forward. Just the impending doom to the planet because you happen to need to eat. Perhaps this gives someone the reason to take better care of themselves, it just gave me the urge to argue against the one-sided debate that they presented."
1,Politically Motivated,"This video sets out to be educational on the virtues of eating organic but the real motivation is revealed shortly after the first couple of interviews. Don't waste your money or time on the pro-union, anti-business, socialist junk. Its clear the producers of this film only want to demonize big food companies."
5,Telling the truth about our food,"Food, Inc. reveals the cruelties that have been hidden from us, food consumers,for many decades now. It not only enlightens us about the horrific practicesof the billion dollar food industry, but also offers ways about how we can helpachieve changes in the system, such as shopping at farmer markets, directlybuying from local farms, caring about what we eat and how it is raised,demanding that our grocery stores carry acceptable brands, and by letting policymakers and local and national politicians know of our preferences for wholesome,sustainably and humanly raised, locally grown food."
5,"Informative, Educational - will change how you view your food","Very educational and informative. I had a few mouth dropping moments, and was surprised to learn about how the U.S. food industry operates. The sections on e. coli and the meat processing plants solution to combat contamination was especially shocking. Definitely makes me think twice before choosing my food and what I feed to my daughter. Definitely recommend."
4,"Food, Inc.",I enjoyed watching the documentation of what's going into my mouth from the farms. To me it wasa little to short. I would have love to see more of what go's on at the farm. Everyone needs totake time out and watch this movie. It Just might help us to make better decision as to what weput in our mouths.
4,scary!,"I have always known that the food industry is more concerned about profits than my health, but I did not imagine it was this bad!"
5,What we don't know about our food!,"I saw bit of this documentary on the Oprah show and was fascinated. As soon as it was delivered to my home, I watched it. How amazing what goes on that we hear nothing about. There are a few parts that are somewhat disgusting...but the truth needs to be told. Farmers can't even be farmers anymore. They are so regulated by big corporations. The widespread uses of antibiotics sure explains the current rise in infections that cannot be cured with ordinary antibiotics. I have watched the movie 3 times now, and am still learning more each time. If anyone wants to learn more about our food sources, and what goes on behind the scenes...this movie is a must. I hope it takes home the Oscar. Fast Food Nation and The Omnivore's Dilemna are also two good books that deal with the same subject matter.NO MORE FAST FOOD FOR ME!"
5,unfit for human consumption,"This DVD is an expose' on how America's food producers maximize production of beef and poultry in an assembly line manner. After seeing this video, you will probably seek out local meat producers that don't pump their animals full of antibiotics and growth hormones."
4,Food for thought...,"I thought I was well informed. I even spent much time on a farm growing up. I had no idea the amount of genetically modified food that is out there now. No wonder our children are maturing far too fast. A must see for everyone, but especially parents. Buy fresh, buy in season, buy local. Don't buy the hype."
5,A must watch,Should be required watching in school. If everyone knew more about their food perhaps their food choices would be wiser.
5,Reality Punch! - A MUST WATCH,"I guess secretly you know that the food we eat day to day had checmicals, pestisides, bacteria and whatnot but we get so caught up in our day to day worlds to stop and really soak this in. This movie will give you 1.5 hours of true and honest circumstances that these farmers and workers come accross that we as consumers really never think about. It's a must watch for those who care about perservation of the soul, our bodies, our families and environments and mother earth itself. Thank you for giving us this reality check. :)I will certainly think about what I ingest from now on."
1,How do novels like this ever get published?,"Cecilia Holland panned this novel, writing that the author ""is ignorant of the education needed to reconstruct so remote a time. Her characters are strictly twentieth century."" Barbara Grier simply wrote that it ""may have the distinction of being the worst book ever written about Sappho.""How novels like this see the light of day is a mystery. It earns one star, only because there's no option for no stars."
5,A Must Buy,"Whether you're a WWII buff, or just a fan of military history in general, you absolutely have to buy this, along with the other three Battlefield sets. These are the original documentaries broadcast on PBS back in the mid-90's, they were great then and still hold up today. Each disk is the story of a different battle, taking you through the prelude, the men in charge, the equipment, the battle itself, and finally the aftermath. There are no interviews as the purpose is to give you the over all strategic view of the fight. The film footage is from the actual battles, and not just generic battle footage like so many other documentaries show. Brilliantly put together, these are hands down the best documentaries on the actual battles of WWII ever made."
4,Russia suffering in WW2,"I thought this disc set was very comprehensive in showing the amount of suffering and losses the Russians endured during the war. It goes into detail of all the battles. Like all the BATTLEFIELD series it goes into great detail of the conditions, the commanders, weapons involved on both sides of the battle. With every documentary you get a slightly different presentation of material and what the author holds to be the most important material. As with all the BATTLEFIELD series you could watch the DVD several times and still pick up on details missed the first time around. There is so much information, it is hard to grasp it all the first time around."
1,havent received it yet,"I am sure that to review something I havent breceived yet would be a waste of my time and yours, Why havent i received it yet??"
1,Defective DVD,"In the set I have, the third dvd consists of a single episode - which cannot be played on my computer. Theother diks work ok."
4,excellent documentary !!,"The ""Battlefield"" documentary is of excellent quality.This is a set packaged about the eastern front. It is reasonably priced and covers the content very well. I am very satisfied and would highly reccommend this."
4,Very good detailed coverage of war betwen Germany & Russia....however doesnt talk much about Battle of Kursk,"This documentary series would have been given 5 stars by me..if it had covered The Battle of Kursk (strangely it didn't). The rest of it does a very good job covering in sober objectivity (mostly) the war between Germany and Russia in WW2.It is not as long as others , such as ""The Forgotten War""..but gives a good concisee overall story, outline to what happened in the BATTLES."
4,Encyclopedic in content but dated production quality,"I went bluray thinking I would benefit from that in some way... maybe I have but it's hard to tell other than perhaps less discs. Very informative and encyclopedic coverage of the matter but I think it was originally a 90's production and it shows... the graphics were a touch ugly. If you're looking for actual intense battle footage you might be a little disappointed. This was definitely geared towards people with an interest in the subject matter and may likely put other less ""keen"" individuals off errr... to sleep. I liked it, the value was there. Action, not so much, cutting edge production, definitely not. Enjoy!"
5,The little known treachery on the Eastern Front is brought to focus!,"Although often overshadowed by what was happening in Normandy and France, this part of the Second World War needs to be further examined! This documentary happily does that! Buy this for a much different perspective."
4,"Loved the singer,",It was so good to find that collection of his songs. However on the second CD there is a defect on Bella Note .
4,good deal,was a holiday gift for my sister she loves these little fairies and they are so cute very easy to find online
4,Great suspense novel by Saul,"First book I read by John Saul. It was hard to put down, well written, and has great characters. It has quite a few twists that were unexpected.What more can I say? Very little to criticize in it. I would recommend it if you're a fan of Dean Koontz, Stephen King, and the like."
5,Just when you think you know what's going on...,"This is the first John Saul book I have read, and I just might be hooked. This book provides some excellent character, the kind that you can easily relate to. The best thing about these characters is you never know what is going to happen to them as some the best are killed off or go insane.I give it four stars because no one would ever be dumb enough to try to make a movie out of it.***"
3,ok,the book is about an academy for young kids who are smarter than average.they take them there so they can study and analyze them.but the academy have a different plan and for the kids who start dissapearing.they want to do test on these gifted kids but they also want to kill them and get their intelligence by.... read it if it interest you!
5,ONE MY FAVORITES,GREAT BOOK. KEPT ME IN SUSPENSE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STORY. NEVER A DULL MOMENT. I DEFINETLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL TYPES OF READERS.
2,Swatch Alu-Me,"Been happy with Swatch Irony models for last decade but this one is very difficult to read, poor visual design of face and hands."
3,great book But...................,"Whether it is as Alexander Kent or Douglas Reeman the books are sure to please but I have to admit in this one the usually well done ""love interest"" was way over the top. It appeared so often at at such length It became an unwelcome distraction rather then a part of the main story."
4,good little Television,"The picture is very clear, the speakers sound great and the remote is easy to use. the screen appears larger than it is. Not as clear as a plasma or an lcd, but very good."
3,nice looking to bad it does not work that good,This tv is better than the ones i used to have.It dosent look bad but there is one small problem the picture has a bad view and also one more thing if I were you I would order a better and cheeper tv.
2,Plagued by sound problems,"The picture on this TV is great; it rivals many of the Sony TVs. However, this TV is plagued by constant sound problems. After 2 weeks of light usage, the left speaker went out. It only comes back on if you raise the volume past 25 and it stays on for a while. Then it thens back off. This problem isn't isolated to this model either. If you read the reviews on Amazon for the TX-R2036 model, that 20"" Samsung is also plagued by the same speaker problems. As of right now, for that model, more than 5 users have posted the exact same speaker problems.In addition, the output of the TV has a constant hum. It is very noticeable when you have headphones or when you have the output plugged into a subwoofer. The hum causes the subwoofer to constantly grumble, making it impossible to watch TV.I strongly recommend staying alway from these Samsung CRT TVs until they get it together with the speaker issues."
3,Had some problems,"I had owned this TV for about 9 months until I decided to get rid of it. Within just a month, I noticed that the right speak kept shorting out. It would go dead and I could only hear the left one. I would have to turn it volume up to 35 or so for it to come back on. And when I turned it back down to normal volume, it would go out again within minutes. Then later on, I noticed that everytime a white background or anything pure white came up on the screen, it would go crazy. The white portion would just go bazerk. It was really annoying. So I finally decided to get rid of it and switch over to a 27"" philips. Hopefully this Samsung was just a bad unit that was sold to me from Best Buy brand new. (Unfortuantly.) Besides the flaws, it was a good TV. The sound was great with it was fully functioning and the picture was great (when there wasn't any white.)"
3,Display not perfect. Sound great.,"I really liked this TV when I first received this TV. I compared it side by side with my older Sony 20"" flat tube TV and found it can hold its own as far as the picture's concerned and the speakers sounded more powerful.However I quickly discovered an issue that greatly bothered me when I was watching letter boxed movies on this TV. The horizontal lines were not parallel and could not be corrected. In my case it was most obvious on the left side, where the display tilted upward. The same problem on this model was reported on web by some other people too. Since I am very sensitive to display distortions, it makes the TV unacceptable to my standard.In fact similar problem can be found with other Samsung flat CRT dislpays. For example, my 19"" computer monitor has problem displaying straight vertical lines."
1,"Nice looking, too bad there was no picture - no replacement?","Ordered the this TV from Amazon because it was the best price I could find. Product delivered with cracked case and no picture showed up when turned on. Is this a Samsung defect or did Amazon just send me a damaged TV - not sure, but read on.I asked Amazon to replace the TV. They said there were no more available?!?! Well, that's weird since my search showed they were still offering the same exact TV at the same price!Makes you wonder what is going on here. Support? There is no phone number to call anywhere on the web site. Their email support was very responsive, but no one would give me a phone number to discuss the situation.At least they paid to ship the item back."
4,Underpinnings of Militant Muslim Logic Explained,"This anthropologist gives an insightful account of the militant Muslim movement from the perspective of one that has first hand knowledge. The book is well written and very readable. The author is articulate, not patronizing, in explaining the distinctions among cultural, religious and militant Muslims for those of us unfamiliar with the Muslim world.Remarkable circumstances allowed the author to befriend leaders at the top of militant Islam is summarized. At the heart of the book the historical underpinnings of militant Muslim logic that makes them hate the West, especially America is clearly explained. In a lucid and flowing style the determined and patient strategies of the militant Muslim movement unfolds. The reasoning as to why militant Muslims believe their people and cause is threatened by, but superior to, the West is very clear and credible. This is a dangerous book. It is helpful to know thy enemy. Citizens of the West take notice."
2,"Worked well, then not so well.","The Sharp microwave worked very well...for 30 days of light use (4-5 times/day). I then tried to heat an item, and the microwave still appeared to work, but was making a much louder noise and no longer heated anything. Very disappointing. (Repacking the unit to return it for a refund was no small task either.) Judging from the many microwave oven reviews I've read, they no longer last 10+ years like the old days."
3,Great power - broke down in 2 weeks,"I needed a powerful microwave for family use, that fit a specific size and was black. This fit the bill. I have had good Sharps before and so went with one again. It worked for 2 weeks and then stopped working. I had to take it into a specific place to get it repaired under warranty and was without it for a number of weeks. The magnatron had to be replaced. It was repaired without cost to me, but with travel time and being with out a microwave for a few weeks, I was not impressed! Frustrating! It is working now and I am crossing my fingers that it continues to do so."
4,Good for the money,"This microwave works well, does what its supposed to do. It makes perfect popcorn every time, no burnt kernels, and very few unpopped ones. The sensor seems to work well, although it does tend to ever cook some vegetables for my taste, but I like my veggies somewhat crispy rather than cooked to mush, so that's a matter of personal preference, and no big deal. I just use the timer rather than the sensor for that. The setting for potatoes cooks them just right. I've had this oven for about a year, and so far no real complaints. UPDATE***after less than a year of use, the light went out. It is not customer serviceable, so to replace the light I have to take it in to a repair shop."
2,not what i expected.,Dose a great job heating things up. Has to many buttons to push to make popcorn. or heat pizza. If you lose your book you won't be able to cook. At least I can't.
3,Nothing special,Works ok but seems to take longer than the last one I had which had the same watts. Not much more you would need.
5,Love it!,"HA SH R-530EK METALLIC BLACK 1 (Sharp R530EK MICOVEN R530EK)I had a Sharp before this except it also had the Convection feature. I never used the Convection. I love, love this microwave and purchased it for much less than they had in the stores. It came within two days. Thank you, Amazon!"
1,worst microwave ever,One week with the microwave and the control panel segments started to fail. 3 months and the thing got very loud. inside stains easier than most. uneven heating. We use it alot (2 meals a day). Shopping for a new microwave.
4,Sharp microwave,"I bought this Sharp R530EK microwave to replace my old one and it works the same, just a few more features. I love the performance of it, my only thing is the top left front of the door seemed loose to me. I sent my first one back with no problems and received a second one. It has the same problem so I took it to a place here that was covered on the warranty and had them check it out. They said it was fine and just the way it is made, no loose hinge and no leaks of microwaves. That was my main concern so I am very happy with my microwave and the way it works."
2,Only lasted 16 months,Was a good microwave while it lasted. But sure didn't last long. Only 16 months and the warrenty is 12 months. We also had a problem with the door not fitting right when we first got it.
2,Good for awhile,"I owned a Sharp microwave oven for almost 30 years before it finally needed replacing last year. We replaced it with this model (Sharp R-530EK). It worked fine for 13 months when one day it died no longer powering up. It is one month out of warranty. I looked on the internet for possible fixes. Some suggestions were a blown fuse in the oven. Pursuing this route, I then discovered the oven panels cannot be removed with common tools because they use some unconventional screws in a few places. They use Phillips head screws for all but a few screws. So the oven is off to junk pick-up after only 13 months. Seems like Sharp microwave ovens are a much lower quality these days.I need to buy a new oven but it probably won't be Sharp."
2,disappointed,"I had a Sharp Carousel microwave purchased in 1993. It died a slow death, and then finally in July of 2011 it died for good. I replaced it with this model. The pre set buttons were not as good as the original. I preferred the preset time to the sensory cooking which wasn't as accurate. There were so many more steps to using the buttons that I found it easier to just punch in a time and let it go. So after 14 months of use I was just getting used to the ""new"" machine, and now I don't have to worry about it because it died. Now I did not expect it to last as long as my original model, but 14 months?? Very disappointed. Also, I don't know what to buy now. I always liked my Sharp better than anyone elses microwave, and now I don't feel as if I can trust them."
5,good bag,"It fits! it works, good bag! I accidentally ordered the wrong bag and it didn't work- so I was more careful now and got what I needed, thanks Amazon!"
1,A True Waste of Time,"I can't believe I wasted my time reading this book. It was atrocious! The characters were reduced to 2 dimensional garbage. You knew what was coming chapters ahead. The author tries to draw out the dark temptations each character experiences but it was so bland, so cartoony, and very very unimaginative. She discards characters because their abilities just so happens not to fit in battle, how convenient. Ugh, I don't know why I even read it. I kept giving the author another chance with each chapter, and it was not worth it. Truly, stay away from this book."
3,Would like to see Duane get another chance,"Diane Duane is one of my favorite authors. She's intelligent and interesting and given a chance to fully explore a select few characters she can really nail them. For those who didn't like this book (and it isn't one of my favorites) I strongly suggest reading Duane's Spider-man trilogy, which is fabulous.I agree with Diana Naier - I think this book had too many characters for her to flesh out their backgrounds and motivations fully. I would like to see her get another chance to write an xmen novel with just a few of the main characters."
1,More about Xavier's sex life than I wanted to know,"First of all, let me just say Charles is not supposed to behave like a hormonal teenager. But that's exactly how he comes off in this book. A crisis hits, some new diffuculty in killing this Bug Eyed Monster of the Week, and Charles and Lilandra hop in the bed! Honestly, it got old after the first two chapters. Also, the writer completely forgot Charles IS Lilandra's acknowledged consort, according to the comics. An annoying error to be sure.She wastes the other characters as well. Beast is only here for snappy one liners. Gambit (without Rogue - BORING!) has powers utterly unlike his in the comics. Even Scott and Jean come across as a generic couple. She could have used the exact same plot and just changed the names to Spock, Kirk and McCoy. I doubt we would have noticed a difference.I was hoping these books would get better with more established writers. Looks like I still will have to hope."
2,Not for those who fondly remember their youth...,"If you are looking to recapture your youth through X-Men novels, skip this one. You won't like the way this book treats its characters.If you are looking for an afternoon read; occasionally enjoy a bubblegum-for-the-brain space story; are more interested in plot than characters; and most importantly, didn't put down good money for the book but got it from the library, you might like it.That's worth two stars."
4,GREAT DANCE MUSIC!!!!,"FOR THOSE WHO LOVE ITALO DANCE MUSIC,THIS CD WILLSATISFY YOUR NEEDS!!! :) CD HAS 14 TRACKS INCLUDINDHEY HEY GUY AND TONIGHT,12 OUT OF 14 ARE SET TO MAKE YOU DANCEYOUR BUTT OFF.OVER ALL A GOOD CD TO HAVE."
5,"Get this, you won't regret it","Ranging from techno to trip hop to dub, Marumari has covered all the bases with ""Wolves Hollow"". Although this isn't the most groundbreaking album i've heard, it's comforting to hear an artist who isn't afraid to make many different kinds of music and manage to put them all together with a consistent style. Good for a lazy afternoon or chillout music late at night."
5,Intelligent Design,I have owned this album for near a decade(Amazon's release date is incorrect) and it is truly a pleasure to be with. I have yet to find anything similar to the composers finesse and experimentation(although I would be pleased discover more) with beats and the subtle wolf theme. I still break up my newer music rotations with this album and pass it on to my friends. All the best~
3,nothing revolutionary...,...and CERTAINLY not a creative or original as Boards of Canada. The first track is pretty good...but the rest seem very minimal and boring.
4,bulletproof!,"Very happy with this watch. I love watches, I've owned dozens, but I'm sick of the junky throwaways. Now I'm down to two.

5,Extremely Informative!,I am so glad that I bought this book! It has so much information that's usable for even the novice; easy to read and follow. I would recommend this book to anyone that's interested in using natural remedies on their cats. It saves so much money and makes me feel rest assured when I use safer products on my fur balls!
2,this is not [w]holistic,"The statement, ""a must for people who love their cat"", is a bit passive aggressive. There are narrow defitions of ""holistic"" and there are true ones. This falls into the homeopath[et]ic former: ideological. Unless i buy ""remedies"" (which have never worked on me) then the book has little use. Hey, don't get me wrong. If you define the ""whole"" in ""holistic"" as ""partialistic"", as in doubl;ethink, then this is a ""whole"" approach.There are few herbal, ionic mineralistic, enzymatic, vitaministic, food combinationalistic, et. al. modalities in this ""whole"", reminding me of the redefinition of ""health"" in ObamaScare as toxic ""pharmaceuticalization""."
5,Welcome addition,"Veterinarians' Guide to Natural Remedies for Cats is a welcome addition for those who wish to pursue natural remedies for their cats. It gives the reader a variety of choices in each section, so that one is able to select one thing, and if that does not accomplish all that one hopes, one is able to make another choice. Many modalities are mentioned including homeopathy, acupuncture, chiropractic care, massage, and herbal medicine. There is discussion of a healthy diet as well. Mr. Zucker interviewed a number of holistic vets from around the country and compiled their suggestions into this much awaited volume. I can recommend it highly."
3,Regarding garlic for cats,"I was browsing around for natural cat health information, and read the review below, titled ""Disappointing"".I just found out today that cats can't tolerate garlic when I took my very sick, very anemic cat into the vet and realized that I may have contributed to the problem! I've used Anitra Frazier's book ""The New Natural Cat"" like a bible for years, and it is a good book, but maybe she needs to revisit the garlic issue, which she highly recommends as a treatment for cats.I've just been to the website the reviewer mentioned, http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/garlic.php, and it seems to corroborate what my vet was telling me today - and i was very unwilling to hear.The other reviewers seem to love the book, but I'd say that if you really want a great book on taking care of a cat, get Anitra Frazier's book instead -- just don't give garlic to your cat -- at least not till there's more information about it."
3,Could use editing and updating,"Holistic vet guide for homeopathic and natural cures for cats. Very basic, and could use a lot of editing and formatting into a more concise and cohesive text. Takes a lot of time to plow through the verbiage of each vet to get to the meat of the advice."
3,Good cooking but a few problems,"I have been using this product for 2 years. The cooking results are good and food preparation is speedy. However the turntable motor is of very poor quality (weak plastic gears) so make sure to stay even below the listed food weight limit. I had to replace the motor in my oven (52 bucks if you find the part and do it yourself, otherwise about 140). Also the door and some other parts are not aligned properly. One other review I found on the Net had the same complains about this product quality, in particular the turntable motor was faulty and had to be replaced as well."
2,Sharp R-930AW 1,"Sir:MY wife and I were extreamly excited about ordering this Convection Microwave as it was the exact same model as the one we had. and we loved it.Have been very disappointed as the Wattage is not the same. The first one with a cup of water would be boiling in 1 min. This one, takes at least 2 minutes to heat at the same temp. and anything I want to reheat takes at least 3 min.Not sure what can be done at this point. It's too heavy and takes too much money to send back, as it would have to be repackaged. Also not sure what you would do about it.Sincerey,Roger Wilsonrjwilson@huxcomm.net"
1,A Dud,"I have this microwave for 2 1/2 years and the turntable is indeed a dud and has stopped working properly on convection and microwave mix, which is the feature I purchased this microwave to use. Besides that, Sharp has been unhelpful and difficult to reach."
3,wish I could have kept it,"I ordered and received the Sharp R-930AK. It was bought to replace one I had for 18years and totally loved. This new one could not hold the temperature or get to 400/450. I only used it 4x's and had to return it. It looks great and has nice features and the price was just right, but if having it for 10 days and it spends most of it's time in the repair shop, well it's not worth it. I did bring it to a Sharp dealer, because I wanted to keep it but they never even looked at it. In getting in touch with Amazon. com they told me they would take it back and refund my money or replace it. They made the return easy and I am grateful, but wish I had a working convection/microwave. It took me raising the temperature to 400 or more to get something to bake that was suppose to bake at 350.Here's hoping Sharp will get a clue and put out a better product."
1,Sharp R930cs microwave,When I opened the package the back corner was dented! When I called Sharp customer service to find out the cut out opening size for new built in cabinet they would only refer me to a spec sheet for the cabinet opening. The directinons were very poor.My cabinet maker and I were confused about the size of the opening.sharp should make there specs easy to read!I think the dent was caused by being dropped by the seller not the shipping agent!
3,was too big,I ordered this without really paying attention to the size. My fault. It is a big machine. took up too much of our counter space. Sent it back and ordered the smaller version. The smaller one actually had an extra feature that I really like- the grill.
5,Best Microwave-Convection I've ever owned,"This is the best microwave on the market. Have used this model for @ 10 years, then it needed to be replaced so I bought the same model. Cooks great, looks great, roomy, very easy to use and does everything that an oven should do!I would suggest this to anyone!Peter"
1,Three in one year!,"Have owned several over 25 years and really liked them. However this year (2012), I have had three new ones! All awful. First one--convection stopped working. Second one--right out of the box didn't work at all. Third one--worked okay for about a month, now convection also stopped working. In process negotiating with Sharp for return of my payment so I can BUY ANOTHER BRAND. Watch out!"
5,sharp R-930AK,Excellent unit does ALL that its supposed to do and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for convection microwave!!
5,Great appliance,"Had same model for 11 years and loved the microwave/convention combo, a real space saver in a tight kitchen.The convection function is great for reheating next day pizza slices ,chicken nuggets ect. Heats up much faster than my regular oven so it is a real time saver. The double racks are great for cooking in bulk. Makes holiday cooking easier having a second oven. Just have to be careful not to overload the turntable with too heavy an item as it will mess up the turntable gears."
5,Beautifull and best product,This product is perfect and I had one in the past and I decided to buy another one because this microwave is very very good. The guys that sent me this product is perfect. All things was perfect.
5,This is a wonderful item,"This is my 3rd one in many years, Just love it, never use my oven anymore if it will fit in this one. Don't pay the money if your not going to use it other than to heat something but if you want to cook with it this is the best I have found"
2,Busted,"I'm sure it was a freak accident, but my Sharp R-930AW stopped working one month before the warranty ran out! They must have substituted cheap import components that were missing the ""warranty plus one day burn out"" feature. If you like the smell of burning electronic components, this microwave is the one for you!Update: after having the microwave repaired, it worked fine for a year and a half. Now the turntable stopped working. I can't wait to find out how much this is going to cost."
1,Give me back my 15 year old unit!!!,"This Sharp will not cook Pop-Corn, Convection will not get above 150 deg. Takes 4 minutes to heat a slice of pizza.But it will heat the plate !! Taking any plates out will require Asbestos Gloves !! My unit is 15 months old and I am going out today to buy a new one. ( Not a Sharp )"
2,Fake Reviews?,"This isn't a review (I haven't bought the product) but while reading the others, I noticed they're copy and paste from other sharp products. Such as the R930cs (notice this is the r930ak) they even forget to change that little product number in their review. I'm not saying the product is bad or good, just for potential buyers to not trust these reviews, they seem very fishy and faked to me. So if you are looking to buy one, proceed with caution."
1,Danger!,"I had a Sharp Carousel Microwave/convection oven that looked just like this one for 15 years. I loved it! I baked amazing artisan breads with the convection function and the microwave worked beautifully. When it died, I got another one just like it, or so I thought.From the beginning, the convection oven didn't work the same. Bread came out like hard dough, and chicken didn't brown. But worst of all, after just 2 1/2 years, the magnetron blew up, buzzing loudly and creating a hole in the ceiling from which flames shot out. I was so glad I hadn't walked out of the room like I have on many occasions when I've been heating soup or defrosting meat, or it might have been catastrophic.I was tempted to think this freaky breakdown was an anomaly until I saw all of the similar reviews here. Now I will never buy another Sharp product. Be warned."
1,Quick delivery of a damaged piece :(,"After reading the reviews, I placed an order - against my husband's advice to not buy Microwave on-line :( As my luck would have it, before even we had an opportunity to take the Microwave out of the box, we saw one major and another minor dent on the very top. Amazon's return policy is a snap (at least so far - have scheduled a pick-up); I wish they would also make buying bulky items from their site a breeze :("
2,Sharp Oven Purchase,"I can provide a better review, after the oven is received.The first oven arrived damaged; I awaiting the arrival of the replacement unit."
2,This is a poor microwave,"I purchased this as part of a big remodel. I previously had a cheap $100 Sharp microwave. The new one is not good. Convection cooking for stuff lke simple chicken nuggets is horrible. It never cooks frozen meals properly. It does do a good job with the sensor reheat, but I'm very disappointed. I liked my previous microwave better."
5,Great Microwave/convection over,This is a replacement for one of the exact same model which I had been useing for approx 10 years before it stopped working. I was suprised to find that this model was still available.Wonderful product.
2,Great - WHEN it works!,"Yes, it looks great and has all the features I wanted. Loved it but after four years (and I am not talking a big family with tons of use) I have had it fixed twice, not easily due to the size and weight, or cheaply, there is only one guy in our area who works on them. Now the turntable stopped again and it doesn't work. With no warranty I've had it with this thing. After reading lots of reviews it seems impossible to find a convection microwave that works without repairs and that lasts for years. I'm sending this to the recycle dump and getting two appliances - a cheap microwave and a nice toaster oven I can bake in. When I need to throw those away, I won't feel so badly!!"
2,For this price...what should you expect?,This is the second time this unit has totally failed.It was nice to have a back up oven but I cannot warrant paying to have this fixed again.I must note that the unit is 6 years old.I will give it 2 stars because it is 6 years old and I do not know what I should expect.Obviously I expected more than I got.With further review-all of these combination units have issues.You can buy a better microwave AND a better counter top oven for less.
1,So disappointed,"I had a Sharp microwave convection oven for 10 years-so when it started to act up I immediately ordered another one-from the beginning-within 3 days- it did not work properly-I was familiar with the oven so when a 9 pound turkey-on the compucook cycle-took a total of three times the time to cook-I knew something was very wrong-I contacted Sharp and was furious with the computer generated answer I received-I detailed my problems completely in the e mail-I have taken the oven to the suggested repair shop 9/20-they contacted me and started to say the oven was fine-when I told them that I had had a Sharp micro convection oven for 10 years they stated ""oh-well we'll order some parts for it"" I informed them that when they had ""fixed ""the problems-I would bring some microwave popcorn to cook to see if the oven works properly-it is now Sept 30 and I have not heard from neither Sharp not the repair shop-I will give them another few days-beware of this itemNaomi Paget"
1,Disposable microwave -doesn't last.,"Great microwave, but what good is something the doesn't work? After 3 years of use it blew up, and after screaming and yelling we got Sharp to fix it. Then one week after the five year magnatron warranty ended, it blew up again. What ever happened to having a microwave for 20 years? I paid $529 for this microwave and spent a fortune building it into my cabinet. I should have bought the cheapo $150 Panasonic."
4,Sharp convection microwave,"This is a replacement for my previous Sharp convection microwave oven that I had purchased in 1999. I looked around and couldn't find one that I liked better for my family which includes teenagers. The convection oven works great and doesn't heat up my house like the oven on my range, and it can also work as a second oven during holidays! The microwave works well, wish it were 1100 watts instead of 900...I guess the trade off is worth it to me. Easy to use. Love the stainless steel...my last one was black. A great buy!"
3,Weak turntable motor,"I certainly agree that the turntable motor could be better. I have this unit in my RV which I purchased in August of 2008. The gears in the turntable motor stripped out in July of 2011, and this is with VERY light use compared to a residential application. The motor is very easy to replace by removing an access cover on the bottom of the unit, but removing it from its mounting location in the RV is not easy. I purchased the motor for only $25 shipping included.Other than the turntable motor, the unit functions properly and I have not had any other issues with it."
1,Less than Sharp,"From day 1 this unit couldn't manage to melt shortening. The microwave is a 90 pound weakling, and the convection performance is marginal ... a small roasting chicken wasn't browned, and not heated evenly. Had a GE that cost $75.00 last over 10 years, it would ""boil"" shortening in the time it took this over-sized toy to warm it. Poor customer service response. 60 miles total shuttling for repair work? Not a chance, it's going back to the dark hole it crawled out of. For the hard earned dollars of this American consumer ... poor workmanship, marginal design, lousy CS. Not worth the time, money, or inconvenience. Beware of global economic grifters."
2,BREAKS DOWN IN UNDER 5 YRS,BOUGHT THIS MICROWAVE/CONVECTION OVEN IN JUNE 06. PAID ALMOST $400.00. TODAY IS APRIL 2011 AND IT HAS STOPPED WORKING ALREADY. YOU WOULD THINK AN ITEM THIS COSTLY WOULD LAST LONGER THAN THAT.
2,"COOKS WELL, BUT IS POORLY MADE!","I bought my first one in 1985. It worked well for about 3 years and then the convection keypad stopped working. The repair man said it was not worth fixing. We used it as a microwave only for a few more years then purchased another one. The second one worked well for 3 years. The door stopped working and eventually a plastic part broke off. I wish I had kept the first one, because I could have replaced the newer broken door with the old door! It also began to loose its heating power. These ovens cook very well when new. The interior size is great and you can cook just about anything in them. They really bake well. The problem with this oven is that it is made with cheap plastic parts that wear out quickly. I just purchased a panasonic stanless steel microwave/convection oven with the same dimensions. It has excellent reviews. Hopefully it will be made better."
5,Only a Sharp would do,"My original Sharp microwave convection oven finally was ""laid to rest"" after 12 years of constant service. I would settle only on another Sharp as a replacement, and living in a small western Colorado town, could not find one locally. My solution was to order one from Amazon. It arrived three days later, and I ended up paying less for the new one than I had paid for the original, 12 years earlier. And although it is very similar, there are many improvements. I am very happy to have my trusty Sharp again. Jeanne Carmichael"
2,Don't Buy Unless you Have To,"I had to buy this model to fit in the space after the other Sharp microvave died after 10 years. The first problem was that the door wouldn't pop open when the button was pushed. Had to take time to locate a Sharp Service Center, leave it for a week. Now the door opens, but slowly. It also has a metallic sound when it opens and closes. Seems more cheaply made than the one I replaced. I have to keep this one because of the size constraints, but I would reccommend that others look around for something better for their $350.00."
1,Sharp is the worst for small appliances,We had this model for 3 years and the turn table and magatron went out. The turn table is not covered by warranty it cost $95 to replace the magatron is under warrantey but even to have the repair done it was going to cost us a total of $291 which is only $65 dollars less then what we paid for this. What a joke. I also wanted to mention I bought my parents a small Sharp microwave and the display blew a month after we got that for them. Because of these two events I will never buy another Sharp applicance.
5,GREAT,"I have used Sharp Micros for years, so naturally I would order a Sharp Micro/Convection Oven. It is super. The operater (me) is still learning the Convection part...but I really like it. Wish it had more wattage than 900, but I'm coping."
1,Atrocity,"I'd give this CD zero stars if possible. As an ethnomusicologist who has worked in Africa for a long time, I find the CD badly misrepresentative of the Aka, to say the least, and racist and insulting to be more accurate. It incorporates all the stereotypes of Africa in general and the pygmies in particular, including sampled voices that sound like munchkin voices, not to mention reference to the pygmies as ""a race of little men"". Though perhaps Deep Forest meant well, their intended global connectedness only proves the extent of their ignorance. I wonder what the Ba'Aka think of this music?"
4,Pampered Chef Delightful Desserts Cookbook,"Ordered 2 -guess from same person--and rec'd one plus a different Pampered Chef Cookbook. So did not get what I ordered, but am pleased with the other cookbook also. So it worked out OK. Will just order another Delightful Desserts from list."
5,good heavy traffic seed combo,i'm not a lawn & garden expert but it works well for us in the area our 2 labs frequent.
3,"effective, but expensive","This product does work well, but the adhesive doesn't last long, 3 to 4 weeks at best. For the price, it doesn't seem worth the results. Also, because I tend to sweat at night when I get over heated, the pad didn't always stick very well. I also developed a rash on my chest during the nights I sweated. So all and all, this item simply didn't provide enough pros to outweigh the cons for me. I will say on the nights I didn't sweat and I woke with the pad still firmly on, the wrinkle correction was amazing. Smooth as a baby's bottom. I have switched to a night bra sold by chestsavers.com in the hopes of ending chest wrinkles. So far, so good."
2,Stickiness didn't last even 10 days!,"I can see how this product would be great if it wasn't so expensive and the stickiness didn't rub off within the first week. I was extremely careful to put the pad on a clean, dry area as recommended. Not all of the stickiness rubbed off but the top half was useless after the first week."
3,Was super fired up about this initially,"But then...I realized that this product has some definite drawbacks. Really, what it does the most is encourage me never to flip onto my side, because it stretches my chest skin into unnatural positions, hurts, peels and then...I've noticed that it's starting to stretch the skin at the base of my neck. Nooooo! So, I will wear this only before a large event (a couple hours before), where I want smooth cleavage. It does deliver that for a few hours after you take it off. In the meantime, I'm going to crack and order the pillow."
5,work better than you'd ever think!,"These pads are incredible! I'm 45 and have had those chest creases every morning for years. It never bothered me except for summer, when the world gets to see it, but even then I figured there was nothing I could do about it short of plastic surgery. I tried these pads because I was told they not just lessen the creases, they erase them, but I did not believe it could work this well. Just one night of wearing and my chest looked completely smooth. I didn't experience any redness after wearing it all night, other than maybe the first minute after I pulled it off. When this one wears out, I'll definitely buy another one. What a great, simple product with big results for not too much money."
3,JQR,I was just as excited about this product as I was about the Intimia Breast pillow until this product too failed. After a short period of timeI would wake up with this sticky pad anywhere but on my chest! I wear it when I'm awake and just lying around but that's the best it can do. Make sure you make return plans within alotted time period too!
4,Wonderful product!,"I also was skeptical about this product but after only a few days of use, I was amazed by the results! My only complaint is I wish the pads would last a bit longer for the cost. I have maintained the pads as instructed but by third week they start to lose enough adhesive that it becomes loose around the edges and generally less effective. That said, overall I've been extrememly pleased with the results and if the manufacturer could get them to last closer to a month; I would give it 5 stars across the board!"
1,Not practical,This is thick and uncomfortable and just promotes folds amount itself. So I have not found this to be very helpful.
4,These pads work but . . . .,"I was amazed how quickly these pads work. You can see the difference after the first overnight use, and it continues to get better. I've had these side-sleeping chest wrinkles for at least 10 years, probably more. I'd say after day 3, the lines were reduced about 75%, which is pretty amazing. However, I'm now getting red rashy bumps in my cleavage. Not great . . . . I'm wondering if there's something on or in the pad that I'm allergic to, although I'm not really allergic to anything. I guess I'll stop using the pad for a few days to see if the rash goes away. Then I'll give it another try. Keeping my fingers crossed because it really does work on the wrinkles."
4,Very Cool Product,"When I received this product I was so excited, I sleep on my side so that is where my lines come from. I followed the directions and put it on and went to bed. When I woke up and peeled it off, the results were outstanding!! I was very impressed, you need to be consistant with this product because the results fade after a day. When used for an hour the results do not last long at all so I suggest you sleep with this on. If you are in a hurry and need a quick fix for an event or special night then put it on for an hour and it will do the trick for the evening. What a great product and a good alternative to plastic surgery, not to mention Way more affordable! I now use this product along with an anti wrinkle chest cream and it's working great. Always make sure your chest is clean with no creams or lotions on it before applying, put the chest cream on After you peel off the pad. I hope this review helps :)"
3,Works well... but not for sensitive skin,"I think this product works well. I does help those ugly lines between the breasts, BUT it always leaves me red and irritated after a night of sleeping with the pad. I wish this wasn't the case, but it is! I also notice that the pad leaves a crease at the top center of the chest, which goes away within an hour or so... but in my opinion shouldn't happen, as it defeats the purpose overall, right? Cleaning the pad is easy. It does get pretty yucky if you don't care for it after each use. I even trimmed the pad a bit to make it fit better. I would prefer a smaller pad, as most of my fine lines are in the center of the upper chest from sleeping, not so much between the breasts due to age. Overall, I recommend the Calvet pad, but not for everybody, as it is very irritating if left on all night."
3,"Too big, doesn't stay put","For the price, I expected this produt to work much better.First of all, this pad is way too big for my chest. I am not a petite person, 5'6"" 135 lbs, 34-C bra size. I placed the pad on my cleavage at the bottom and it went clear up to my collar bone at the top. It would stay on fine while sitting or standing, but once I layed down, the sides immediately pealed off. So, I ended up cutting the triangle shape into an oval shape, and it sticks on a little better now.I will say that my ""cleavage wrinkles"" are a little better now (I've worn it three nights), but I'm not sure if it's worth the price tag."
1,FALLING A PART,"AFTER 2 WEEKS USING IT, DOES NOT WANT TO STICKY ANYMORE. I KEPT SKIN CLEAN AS PER INSTRUCTIONS AND ALSO WASHED PAD AS INSTRUCTIONS."
2,"Bought 3 pads, all lost adhesiveness rather quickly","The pad works, but it loses adhesiveness really fast. My first one lasted about 2 weeks, second - a week and the third one just few days. I'm looking for alternatives"
4,Works Well!,"These really do work! Not only did they get rid of the lines that were already there, but worn nightly they do not come back. I wear one every night when I go to bed.They are a bit expensive...."
4,"Great product, but very short life...","This product definitely does prevent chest wrinkles caused by sleeping on your side REALLY well! However, they are expensive and do not last long. Even if you wash after every use, they loose thier sticking quality after about 2 weeks, so be prepared to buy a few at a time. They are also not ""discreet"" as the advertisement indicates. You don't want to wear this in public becuase it is VERY obvious!. But, in all, IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Best anti-aging for the chest!,"This is absolutely a great product. It really works. I tend to wear a lot of lower cut tops in the summer. I am definitely a side sleeper. I am disappointed that they don't last very long. Washing them slightly with an anti-bacterial soap works. It will appear to have completely lost it's ""stickyness"" at this point, but as it dries, the adhesive comes back to life. I've had it for approximately 45 days. It's not misleading, because the instructions do say, ""lasts 30-60 day"". Follow the instructions. It is well worth the money. I've just ordered my second pad. Trust me on this one. I'm a beauty/anti-aging products freak. One of the best!"
3,Works BUT.....,"They work awesome. My wrinkles were GONE overnight. However, the pad is too small to cover my chest and they only last 10-15 days instead of the 30-60 promised.That was a huge disappointment as they are not cheap."
3,"Delighted first 2 times, disappointed now","My previous 2 pads lasted for many months and were very effective, my last order - not so much. The adhesive quality of this last pad is poor, starting to lift during the 2nd night. When the pad lifts from the skin it can not do what it's intended to do. Since I'm having such an entirely different experience with my last order and others have had problems with the adhesive, I'm wondering if the quality of the adhesive varies during production. Based on this last experience I would not reorder."
4,I love this product!,"I see great results in just one week! This is what I've done: Exfoliate the area, apply my anti-aging moisturizer, then apply Decollette Pads. Amazing results in such a short time!"
4,Week 3...,"I've followed the instructions and the additional instructions left by other users (Thank you!)and so far at week 3 mines still sticking almost as much today as the first day. However, even the first night I found that if I sleep fully on my side it will pop off in the middle. At first I couldn't get much sleep because I was worried about it falling off and wasting the whole pad, but now I've learned to stick back on in my sleep for the most part... And I've found I sleep less on my side because of that and more and more often I wake up on my back. And I've also found (as long as I get it on straight at night and don't bunch my skin under it either upon placement or in my sleep during replacement) I wake up with out any deep wrinkles. I am enjoying that, but now my age spots are attracting my eye more... If it's not one thing it's another... I will probably buy another pad as long as I can make this one last 6 weeks."
2,Decollette Pad,Great concept for preventing chest wrinkles. The adhesive made my skin break out and itch. I would not recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin
3,Irritates my skin,"I liked this product at first. But I find they don't stay on well at night. When I wake up in the morning the pad has migrated around to different places on my chest. I don't use cream on the area first or anything. I'm lucky if the pad lasts a month. But the worst problem is the this product really irritates the skin on my chest and makes it feel rough and red. It went away when I quite using the pad for several weeks. I think it leaves some sort of residue on my skin that really irritates it. I don't even use it anymore. I've been trying the long scar sheets on my chest instead. They don't irritate my skin, but they aren't as thick as I'd like them to be -- but they seem to be helping because my chest wrinkles are greatly diminished."
2,Disappointing,"This product has great potential, but falls short. After using it less than a week I found that as I would lay on my side one side would come off and peel down. My hair would get caught in it and it was a big mess. I followed all of the care instructions because I really wanted it to work, but it never fully stuck for me. Not worth the price! Hopefully one day they can develop one that actually sticks, maybe disposable ones."
5,Better results than any cream or product I have tried!,"This pad is amazing!!! Wore it one time and my deep verticle chest wrinkles were 75% less noticable. I do not wear to sleep in as uncomfortable but do use it for one hour each morning. The cost is expensive as it only lasts about a month, you can stretch it to 6 or 7 weeks, but again the result is outstanding and well worth a try as a wrinkled chest adds years to us previous sun worshippers."
4,Product does work,"This is the second time I have ordered this product. It does work! It is not attractive, but serves the purpose."
5,Great Envelopes,These envelopes are great. They are very red and you can not see anything inside. They are also very good quality. I highly recommend them.
5,Great Envelopes,I used these envelopes to send my poinsettia invitations to my exercise class for the Christmas party. They were fabulous and I highy recommend these envelopes.
3,so so,"color was a little off for me, and some of the envelope parts that you use to seal were slightly ripped. They'll do for holiday cards no problem, but not for anything high end"
3,good price and average quality,"For this low price, I should expect an average quality of the red envelops. It is ok if you use them as the regular white ones. But these red envelops are not suitable for special occasions due to their so-so quality."
3,Envelope glue,"About half of the envelopes I purchased had insufficient or no glue on them, which meant I had to use a glue stick. Slightly annoying."
3,Stamps wouldn't stick to it!,"Ok, this is a little odd....the stamps wouldn't stick very well to the surface of these envelopes. They were the sticker stamps directly from the post office, not the ""licking"" kind. I would firmly place the stamp on the envelope, and 2 hours later, come back to find the stamp had peeled up on the corners. I guess there was something about the paper itself that didn't allow the stamps to adhere well. I didn't return them, but went ahead and used them and just hoped for the best. As far as I know, everyone I sent them to got them....so no harm, no foul."
1,lovers and friend should never be in this movie,that was the cheapest movie ever did you all see when they were driving like they were driving from wherever they were to las vegas but they were actually driving in a parking lot
1,Worst Movie Ever!!! (Negative 1 million stars),"This is the worst movie that I have ever seen. I wish I could get the 73 mins that I wasted watching this crap. The storyline, acting, grammar, still shots of Vegas, everything about it was horrible. Recommending this movie to anyone would be a cruel and unfair punishment."
3,fun for kids but does not last,"My seven year old twins love this toy. The variations they are able to make keep them busy. They never get bored re creating their lightsabers, and challenging each other to battles. Be warned these did not last three months in our house."
4,"Durable, entertaining, and true to form",My son has driving me nuts wanting this toy. It was a relief to find how durable it is no matter how often he builds and rebuilds it. I recommend this to any Star Wars Fan!- grateful mom!
4,best star wars light saber,"I like the toy but I think the double bladed light saber is dissapoointing because only one blade lights up. I wish that the blade would retract fully and would not fall out so easily. The colors are a little off. The green is very lime green. The blue is a little too light, but the red is pretty close to the same shade in the movies. I am dissapointed to find that you cant have a purple blade or a curved hilt. I like the crystals ecspecially the green one. the blue emiiter is my favorite. Ibuilt mine a couple of days ago and its a mix of darth vaders and obi-wans. All in all Im impressed,but i wish you could have a gold hilt or purple blade."
4,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The build your own lightsaber is awsome! It's really fun but it does have some downsides to it. The sound effects stink (except for the blue crystal), the colors need some changing, and why can't you mix the colors up so you can make a purple lightsaber? When you make a double-bladed lightsaber why cant there be 2 reds and 2 clears, a second lightbulb, and why do you have to have 2 different etmitters. Otherwise instead of those the toy is really great and is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good but flawed,"It's fun to combine the pieces and create different looks.... not sure about 1000 combinations, as certain pieces have to slide on in the right place to keep the power button accessible. And the classic jedi-style ""emitter"" is to be used at the other end of the handle? what gives?The sound effects are horrible, unless this one is defective. Sounds nothing like anything in the movie; Hasbro other digital sabers sound great, why not these?!?!? Two blades but only one light, and their colors don't match? way to not go, hasbro. Two kits can be combined with some home downhome ingenuity, allowing two lit blades, matching colors.... and double the horrendous sound. Jesus. And C-cells? why c-cells? the other models need AA's, cheaper and rechargeable.Despite all that, kids will love it anyway. Exept maybe the sounds. Criminy...."
3,not as good as it looks,"when I first heard about the build your own lightsaber i was really excited to get it, but when i recieved it i was disapointed to find the sound for it and the lighting was horrible. The hilt was not very good and the pieces you could add were very little making it uncofortable to hold. the only thing that I liked about it was that you could make it into a double bladed lightsaber, i sugest not to get this, it does look and sound better than it actuelly is."
3,Question:,I was just wondering why this lightsaber kit is $39.99 in Toys R Us and $124.00 on Amazon?
4,lightsaver,"I think this toy is really nice and entertaining, my son spend a lot of time making the different lighsabers he can make, He plays all the time with it and I got a lot more of what i was expecting and my son really loves it"
2,Way to go Hasbro,"Toy makers are becoming increasingly lazy....and everyone loves it. No longer will toy makers assemble toys before they give them to you..but they expect you to assemble them..and expect you to have fun doing it. If you want something customizable i guess this will work. But if you want to hit things, people, objects with it, just buy a $13 one from your local wal-mart.peace out"
1,crap,this is the worst toy I have ever gotten. I hate it!! It breaks in two seconds and you lose all of the parts.
3,Had to have it...,"...and now he probably doesn't even know where it is!aahhh..youthThis toy was a little difficult to get together at first. It also wouldn't work for some reason but with a bit of tinkering, we got it working. The double saber option makes for an enormous saber..particularly for an 8 year old. It also doesn't work the same on both sides, so we went back to just one side.The sounds and lights are cool and my little guy really does seem to like it. (when he remembers he has it!) I personally thought it was a bit pricey at $35+ but since I saw it elsewhere online for $99...!!!! Amazing the rip offs out there...probably got it too as this thing was impossible to find at Christmas..thank goodness for January birthdays!Overall...a neat toy for those obsessed with all things Star Wars...albeit a pricey one."
4,Sith Or Jedi? YOU CHOOSE,"This is a very fun toy!Although they should have put in more parts and sometimes it may not be very durable,and they should have put in some more blade colors and if possible a brighter light.Other than that me and my 11 year old son and I had some fun making our own lightsaber and dueling eachother.Also the sounds may have been better.OH and did I mention how fun this was?Well it is very fun I recomend wait let me rephrase that I HIGHLEY recomnd you buy this it s worth is but buy it at fredmyer or somen cause seriously $35 isnt worth it.But buy it you'll have lots of fun"
5,your journey is about to begin,we have all seen star wars episodes 1 2 3 4 5 6 and we all no they r the best films in the galaxy so now is your chance to reunite the jedi get your lightsaber parts and build build build until you have found the perfect saber 4 u my personal lightsaber is much like obi wans and lukes mixed together but there is one thing you should no never fall to the dark side become a jaedi master and let your journey begin today on the light side
4,Star Wars Light Sabre,Toy is fine but potentially fragile especially since it is essentially a weapon toy and likely to be used in (mock) combat.
3,Interesting but also disappointing,"This is supposed to be more ""true to the point"" as a love story for the underclass, but it comes off as more of an exploration of how to feel superior since it does not go into the ""why"" of what happens, the structure of ""how"" the two who headline this wound up as members of some disposable underclass, and doesn't have a true resolution, it simply runs out of story and leaves you hanging as to what the male intends to do.The concept was great, the delivery is good, but falling from greatness to kinda good is a painful fall."
2,"Good navagation, bad finds","Finding the address you desire to go to kept giving me a not in database error. The only way I could program any address was to go there and then save it. Not good for cross country trips. The unit works good otherwise, telling you where to turn etc. and finding places already programed like eating placing, other interesting sites, good. I would not recommend this unit for anyone, but of course, it could have been a faulty programming on the manufactures part."
2,"Great unit, except for unacceptable product support","Huge screen, detailed directions, ease of use. These things are all there; HOWEVER, Cobra has not published a software update since August of 2006. Consequently, all of the directions are getting less and less accurate as time passes. I live in a city with lots of new highways, and you can't get around here at all with this GPS because it doesn't recognize any of the new roads. To choose now, I would choose a unit that updates automatically rather than waiting for the manufacturer to show some concern for the accuracy of its products."
3,not totally satisfy...,"I received Cobra GPSM 4000 as a gift from my son in Mother's Day.I was really happy... it works fantastic. Until something happen the last time I put it on, that keeps showing ""Error and I am unable to go anywhere', because the GPSM 4000 keep saying, ""Can't find where you are"" well that now is a problem. It doesn't show the map or anything, where I am. Lili Ibarra"
4,"Good, with a few glitches","I actually love the Cobra GPSM 4000 Nav One. However, there is a problem it has that is not just some small problem to me. On several occasions, it gives the incorrect names for exits. The saving grace is that the distance until you reach the exit is correct. For example, I needed to take interstate 64W. Exit 64W was 1 mile away, and exit 64E was 0.5 mile away. The Cobra told me to take exit 64E in 1 mile. Therefore, I have been able to take the correct exit because it gives the correct distance, but it shouldn't be that way.Other than that issue, I love the Cobra 4000. It is great to have it in the car and have access to Points of Interests immediately. I also like that I can plot the point of someplace I want to return again, and save that place to my address book. It is also quick to find where you are."
2,A Mediocre Translation of a Flawed Book,"LeRoy Ladurie's original study (in French) based on inquisitorial records, while marred by numerous mistranslations, misunderstandings and misuse of the sources, nevertheless, had a somewhat magisterial quality about it. It is charming and well-written. In the hands of an expert, aware of its limitations, Montaillou has some value; to the layperson: beware. The translation, moreover, is truly bizzare. Part I is translated fully; Part II severly abridged. There was no rhyme or reason for this. It is far better to read the French original. If you're a novice or don't read French, avoid this book."
5,Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error (Purchased on 05/15/2008),This book is extremely interesting and fills in the day to day lives of these Cathares with specific names and events. Very useful for my research.
5,Excellent historical document,I was looking for a good review of the inquisition and life at that time. This book totally met my expectations.
2,install cd necessary,"first run , insisted good floppy needed reformatting ?then - refused to eject ( no entry in xp menu , for )but instructions say "" do not unplug , with floppy ""and the installation cd mentioned , was not in box ;"
3,OK,"I found the book a bit dated. The book seemed more about Network Defense than Pen testing. For someone interested in Pen testing, there are much better books available"
4,Life and times of the true master,"There are no limitations , save those that we create for ourselves... Bruce LeeThis is a great book if you are looking for a compilation of rare photos and facts.. Unlike most books out there that beat around the bush , This book showcases the man as he wanted to project himself to the world .The perspectives are variable throughout the book , giving the reader a vast panoramic view of the life and times of the much hyped martial arts superstar..Frankly, if you're looking for a detailed description of his persona , you will find exactly that and more.. Full of great photos that give a realistic insight on the master , this book is a good buy if you are interested in the glam..If you are a martial artist however , I would strongly suggest that you do not buy this book . There are various other books that will serve your purpose, books like 'The Tao of JKD'."
4,Lost classic,This album was so slick and unlike Culture Club's previous releases - yet it was extremely good. I guess the drugs got in the way and I feel like there could have been so much more to come after this one. Culture Club produced many great albums in a very short span of time. You kind of get that though it sounds so good - the heart wasn't in it - and then they broke up.
5,Great Textbook,"This book is great for my Social Work course in college, almost need to keep it for my shelf for further reference. Love this subject."
3,its ok...,Not bad for the price. Not too exciting though. I know there is a newer version noe but my professor said we could use this one.
3,Lots of LITTLE pieces ~ YIKES!!~ not for young kids,I have a 4 year old who wants EVERY Polly Pocket thing out there. She received this for her birthday and absolutely loves it......but from a Mom's point of view......I'm so tired of finding all the VERY little pieces everywhere. We've lost a lot already and have had it only a few days. This would be great for older kids who can take care of there toys better maybe 6 or 7. It has a lot of things to do just too many small pieces for younger kids.
5,I don't even like country music....,"I don't even like country music. I own Julie's first cd, and just ordered this one after sampling it and reading the reviews here.She has such a strong and beautiful strong voice, and I think she is much better than Faith Hill in regards to the music that each of them release.I can't wait to get this cd and I am thrilled that it is only 6.99 and I didn't have to pay 13.99 at Best Buy!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I loved Julie's first CD but find myself disappointed with her second effort. Wherease the first CD had a freshness to it, there's a certain blandness to the music on this CD. Most of the songs are the same mid-tempo, one song seems to run into the next without any really standing out. I don't think it's her fault - she's too talented for that. Rather, I believe that she's been let down by a poor song selection and unimaginative production. Hopefully she'll pick it up again on the next one."
4,A very good record,"The second record of Julie Roberts is, like we hope, a very good record, but isn't better or worst to the first one.Julie preserve her style in this production like the other, just we especte a better third CD."
1,Bad Karaoke,"That really is, for me, what this album is. A lot of people have clearly really enjoyed it, but for my money, a poor rendition of Loveshack and a beer at the local bar would have sufficed. The cover of the pop song is probably the most karaoke sounding song, and I notice it is not available for listening on this page. Probably a good move."
5,Love it,Julie is by far my favorite singer. Her first CD is still my favorite but this one is probably tied:) She has such a beautiful amazing voice. Amazing CD! Must have.
5,Julie does it again!,"""Men and Mascara"" is even better than Julie Roberts' fantastic debut album. Though she only co-wrote four of the twelve tracks, she sings every song like she has lived it. Julie has one of the best voices in country music today. You won't be disappointed with this album!!!"
5,Men and Mascara=Amazing!,"This album is truely amazing. It is full of ""real"" country music songs. I cant stop listening to it. Julie is an amazing artist and person!"
5,An ankle strap that dosen't quit,"Several years ago I was given a Jandd ankle strap, and couldn't find it again until recently. For keeping your pant leg out of your bike chain when you commute, I've found nothing better. Unlike most other ankle straps, the Jandd has a loop for folding back the strap for the velcro attachment and is long enough to make a strong secure attachment. Other straps often are only being held by just a very short bit of velcro. For commuting on a bicycle this is the best - no more stuffing your pant leg into your sock."
5,Great strap,"These straps are great. Although you are buying only one at a time, the price is worth the one. They seem to be of high quality, and they definitely hold strong and tight. The straps are wide and can be adjusted to any size you want, even if you have very wide or large pants that are bulky when tied back with a strap like this. I love mine and would buy them again if I lost them."
5,Jean In Chains,Velcro is constructed nicely. It's velcro...Has a reflector. Doesn't matter to me might to others.Keeps my jeans out of the chain. That's what I wanted.Would buy again.
4,No Complaints,"Great product overall - serves it's purpose well to keep your pant leg clear of the chain and chainring and also adds the reflective element. As other reviewers have stated, this ankle strap can also be used for off label uses like strapping things down or together. I strap it to my backpack when not in use in the summer for added reflection"
4,Fine - does the job,"The product does the job but it takes a little while to get used to. Not as convenient as plastic clips, but then again they don't break and they are adjustable. Worth the money."
3,"Works great, but hassle to take off","If I was reviewing this ankle strap in a vacuum, I'd give it 5 stars, no question. It works great and reflects just fine. The only reason I take off 2 stars is because I have another ankle strap that does not include a buckle like this. The buckle is certainly more secure, but it's also a much bigger hassle to remove the strap. With my other one, I bend down for a second, and it's off in no time with just one hand. With this one, I have to crouch and typically use both hands.Small complaint, but worth thinking about if you're in the market for an ankle strap. My strap without a buckle is just as secure for holding back a pair of pants as this is."
1,So Disappointed!,"With a suggested retail price of over $16.00 and words in the title like ""Ornamental"" and ""Flowering,"" I was foolish enough to expect good photos and/or illustrations. There is not one photo or drawing in this entire book, not even on the back cover. It is printed on cheap paper, just a step above newspaper quality, with really short descriptions on each plant. This is the most disappointing book I ever ordered. Not the fault of the seller. Amazon failed to mention that there were no photos."
1,Poor publication,"This is a terrible publication of this classic book. It is a very small book, but it shouldn't be. The print is very very small and all run together. There are no kind of chapter breaks and no spaces in between lines. I know that is a strange description but when you look at the pages it is just like each page is a paragraph of tiny print. This makes it very hard to read, and it is so bad that I am going to just buy another copy by a different publisher. Just thought I would warn potential buyers."
4,Good read,"I bought it in softback form as well, but it will never equal Pilgrim's Progress. I have read that one many times."
5,The Midas Touch,"Tony Touch is holdin it down for Hip Hop, his ""debut"" mixtape is caliente. Although it aint nothin ground breakin almost every track is blazin. Mobb Deep, Wu-Tang, The Diaz brothers, Flipmode Squad, Big Pun and many others turn in 5 star performances. With Toca addin his genius beats and samples this is the hottest mixtape of Y2G so far.R.I.P. Chris Rios a.k.a. Big Punisher"
1,Loser CD,"Got it, Hate it. If the album is as great as all the other reviews say it is, why is there not more than one good beat it listen to. I kept fast forwarding all the songs. Yeh, the artists are there (most are passe and need the money), but believe me, it's from their third rate work that was never put out from which Mr. Touch spins. No way am I playing this in my Keep away. Definitely not worth it."
5,gstapleton,"This is one of the greatest CD's I've heard from a DJ in a while. Even though the shipment of the CD took a long time to get to me, when I listened to it, it was pretty much worth the wait. Tony Touch lyrical skills are on time and you can understand everyword he is saying. If you want a true taste of East Coast, buy this CD."
4,Tont toni tone,Hey its a great mix tape/cd/album but I have heard Better ..I do like tony touches style..and i wish that Track with Cornmega was longer the beat is way nice... But Its a refreshing turn from some of the crap you hear today...Tony TOca has been around for awhile so get you feel if you havent alreadybonis...
3,Love Ain't Suppose to Hurt,"It was very sad, but educational for people looking for love in all the wrong places. It is giving a message to take time and let it find you. But, it could have been better made. Again, add a couple of professional actors in the mix. It is a good story, but played, I guess to their best ability. Everyone cannot act."
4,It was a good movie!,"I enjoyed this play. If you are looking for a good play, with laughter, then you should enjoy watching this one. The actors were pretty good also!!"
1,Lord Help,Not what i expected at all. I was taken by seeing Tyler Perry's name attached but the work seem so different. If you have nothing more to do and just have to watch something then here you go. I wouldn't expect too much.
2,Love aint suppose to hurt,"I purchased this movie and thought it had a gret message but to be honest, the sound was horrible.. the singing was great but there was too much contrast in the movie and the singing portion. Again, good story line but the music was very off."
3,the magicians nephew,"The Magicians Nephew is a great book about a boy named Digory and a girl named Polly. Together they travel through different worlds with magic rings Digory's uncle gave them. His crazy uncle does experiments with the rings he made from a dust his grandmother gave him. He has Digory and Polly put on the rings to see if they can get back from the forest between the worlds. They decide to check out other worlds and in the process run into trouble when they go to a world were they awake and evil queen and accidentally take her back to there world were she causes havoc, and now they have to figure out how to get her out of there world and into another."
1,the human trace it should be called no trace of anything,it was a very bad movie it was so bad i had to force myself to watch in the hope it just might have a seen in it that might make the i spent could make me me feel better it was not so it suck so bad there should be a neg rateing i would give bad egg a neg 4. BILL
3,Deodorizer- but how do I use it?,"OK, I've got 2 dogs and a cat in a small condo- needed a good odor neutralizer. This stuff is strong, and the fragrance was fine- except there are no directions on how to use it. It comes in a small bottle, use it by the drop- but on what? It is so strong, it damages wood, paint, plastic, etc. So what do I drop it ON? I tried a piece of cotton in a glass dish. Not satisfactory. Any advice?"
1,No response from company,"Product sounds great. The only problem is you are taking your chances on ever getting a response back from the company. Apparently this is not unique situation, check other comments on other sites. Buyer beware!"
2,Not what I had hoped for...,"I realize that I'm cutting against the grain of all of the earlier reviews, but I found The Discovery Study Bible to be decidedly disappointing. I've owned it for about a year now, and it is still my least favorite Bible.I find the formatting to be distracting and obtrusive. I actually have a hard time finding certain passages because of the unnatural way that the ""study centers"" are inserted into the middle of the text. I do not find the margin helps to be very helpful at all. The dictionary in the back is too short to be of much use. I'd rather have a concordance than the multiple blank pages for notes in the back. And as trivial as it may sound, the cover design is just plain ugly.Ultimately, I find the features of this study Bible to rarely add to my study of the Scriptures. I only use this Bible when it's my only option at a given time and would not recommend it to anyone. I would strongly recommend the QUEST Study Bible instead."
1,This is the study Bible I use regularly.,"My first copy of this Bible was sent to me by the publisher as a gift from the author whom I personally have known since the 1970s. I knew him from attending conferences where he was one of the outstanding speakers.This Study Bible provides resources for in depth Bible study ""which previously available only in Bible collage and correspondence courses"". Therefore,I might state that it was written with the view for those ""everyday"" Christians who have a yearning for a deeper insightful understanding of Scripture .If I am allowed to own only one Bible, this is the one.Dr. Kenneth Lam, MD,1961; Regent College Dip.,1984"
3,Not great but not bad either,"A good starter study bible. It shows the begining Bible student how to study for themselves and isn't cluttered with too many ""notes"" at the bottom of the page. I would certainly recommend this over a ""notes"" type Bible like ""MacArthur Study Bible"" or ""Life Application Bible"" but only for someone committed to digging deep and getting their hands dirty. The ""New Inductive Study Bible"" is similar to this but does a better job."
3,Republic tank not enough to destroy CIS.,"Overall, I think that these Star Wars sets are the greatest thing that was ever created. But this AT-TE, where do I start! The main frame of the the tank is great, with movable cannons and many clone troopers to battle with. However, the legs are the flimsyest things ive ever seen! In my first battle against the Hailfire Droid, both front legs collapsed! Now I know not to move this tank again!"
5,Good set to buy if you can find it,"You will thoroughly enjoy this set if you like lego or star wars. Decent build, very fun, especially with more than one person. The only problem is that the legs are too weak and too strong at the same time. Too weak are the pieces that join the bottom of the foot to the angled (and way too strong) connectors. But aside from that, this set is worth a try if you can find it for MSRP."
3,All Terrain Terrible!,I like Star Wars and enjoy building the Lego assessories but this model stinks! I have built it twice and the legs have broken each time. This ruined my birthday!
5,Very Informative book,"I bought this book at a rummage sale as I am a native Angeleno interested in Los Angeles history. This is a quite excellent and thorough book which covers not only the city itself but surrounding areas. It provides addresses and maps, making it easy to conduct a self-guided tour of the fascinating diversity of Southern California architecture. Now here's the bad news: this book is out of print, and considering how rapidly the face of Los Angeles changes (this book includes the famous Brown Derby Restaurant, which no longer exists), it's a shame there is no updated edition of this book. I believe such an updated version would be extremely valuable to architecture students and SoCal architecture buffs. If this is you, I recommend tracking down a used copy, but beware: It's almost twenty years out of date."
2,Not as good as before,"I have listened to Jose Luis Perales as long as I remember and I was always impressed by the music, the words and the voice of this spanish singer!I treasure every work he has done cause it is a masterpiece all his work until, the latest cd:It seems to me that, he has become more romantic than before! Before, he used to sing songs with a message that i even cry with the words he wrote. The songs in this new work is not as intense in message as the previews works. There are a couple of songs like, Me han contado que existe un paraiso, is without a doubt, the best in this cd!I will continue being a good fan of him but, i wish he could go back to when he started with songs like, Para Vosotros Canto, Nana Para Mi Madre, etc."
4,Worth reading,"A great story. The flying sequences and aerial combat are great. Excellent characters. It is always fun to read about the ineptness of politicians and the arrogance of Generals and some Colonels. Upon reflection, I wonder about the battle for Ras Assanya. Where was the rest of the Air Force? I find it hard to believe that our country would let an entire Air Force wing, with 72 combat airplanes get wiped out. The convenient bad weather prevented the Navy from helping but it wasn't so bad that the 45th and the bad guys couldn't fly. The Air Force has thousands of airplanes yet couldn't come up with much of anything to evacuate the 4500 personnel??? The story was rather thin in details of support from the other Armed Services in spite of the location of the base. No Army, Navy, Special Forces, Paratroopers, CIA Etc. to help out. I find it hard to believe that any politician would dare allow what happened to the 45th and expect public reaction to be favorable . A good read otherwise."
3,"OK story, but...","The story itself is interesting and deserves 4 stars. I only gave it 3 stars because of the HORRIBLE punctuation. Actually, if Amazon allowed us to rate various aspects of a book separately, I would give the punctuation a negative 2. The author's incessant, unnecessary, use of, commas throughout the story, is so distracting, that I almost put, the book down about, 25% of the, way through, it. I wish someone, would have proofread, this book, for the author, and, told her that, commas are not, required each time, the word, ""and"" is used, in a sentence. She also, needs to be, told that, you don't need to, put random, commas in sentences, just because, they have more than, six, or seven, words in, them.Again, a decent story if you can ignore the atrocious comma usage."
5,Beautifully Detailed,"These earrings are perfect, down to the last detail. They're a modest size, but not overly tiny.They deffinitely fit anyone's style, and can be worn with anything. I was really impressed with the quality of these earrings."
4,SMALL earrings,"The earrings came quickly and are very pretty. They are, however, very tiny, measuring only approx 6mm across."
2,Leather finished on only one side - sandpaper grip,I ordered this leash due to positive feedback about the item. Unfortunately the leather is only finished on one side which makes the other side feel like sandpaper. The inside of the handle also isn't finished making this uncomfortable to hold. When I needed to temporarily shorten up the lead by sliding it through my other hand it was very uncomfortable. I also doubt the longevity of this product due to being only finished on one side. It would more easily soak up moisture.If you wear gloves or don't mind a rough feeling leash then this will work for you. It is very thick leather with what appears to be a sturdy clasp.I returned this item after our first walk today.** Not sure if the other reviewer got the same leash I did because this is not soft in any sense of the word. **
1,You get what you pay for!,This product is offered with or without the timer for a difference of $20. The timer included is a plug in lamp timer that you can buy at a hardware or discout store for $6. The product description says that it is oak. It is not. It is a glossy cherry finish. The description also says that it comes with an ac adapter implying that it also runs on batteries. It doesn't. It only plugs into a wall outlet. The workmanship is very poor. I would not reccomend buying this product.
1,broke down after 15 months,this microwave lasted 15 months ; the control panel was fried and repair cost more than a new one; called sharp and they couldn't care less ; will never buy another sharp product again
1,Product has problems,"I must wholeheartedly agree with the author of the previous post on this product. Sharp makes what I would refer to as a ""disposable microwave"". Ours lasted for just over a year and when we called Sharp for service, I expressed concern that it lasted for so short a period of time. I was told, ""Well, microwaves just don't last as long as they used to. Our consumers typically buy a new microwave after 2-3 years.""Sharp is apparently looking for the population who want a new microwave after a couple of years, because their products certainly aren't built to last more than that."
4,"Good book, but I would have replaced Bledsoe with Flutie","For a book about Bills Legends, you can't expect much more than this. It has photos and averages about 2-3 pages per player. It is just the right size for this kind of book. However, I think they jumped the gun by putting Drew Bledsoe in there after one good season with the Bills. I think Doug Flutie should have been in there instead. Flutie had a winning record as a starter with the Bills, and he may have saved the team from moving. His play caused a great upswell of emotion at the time in Buffalo that coincided with a push by the Bills to get approval for needed upgrades to their stadium. Many Bills fans still love Flutie, and you probably can't say that about Bledsoe. Many Bills fans were anxious for him to leave after only 3 seasons with the team. I think the author may have been jumping on the bandwagon (after Bledsoe's first season with the Bills) when he decided to put Bledsoe in the book."
