5,Great Soldering Project Kit - Highly Recommended,"Length:: 0:46 MinsThis Elenco ""Practical Soldering Kit"" is the same one that is provided in the excellentElenco AmeriKit Learn to Solder Kit(which also comes with a soldering iron and wire-cutters). This kit is a practical way to learn how to solder electronic components on a circuit board. I have been teaching my son electronics for a few months now and it was time to move from theory to practice.The kit includes detail instructions, circuit board, and all of the required components. I am usually leary of all-in-one kit projects since the quality is not always up to what you can get assembling it yourself, but decided to take a chance since we already have a fairly well stocked hobbyist electronics bench, but it turns out that the included items were mostly ""keepers"".The siren project was fun to build with my son and it actually taught him good soldering techniques.Highly Recommended!CFH"
5,"Simple, fun, effective","I bought a couple of these to teach my ten-year old twins soldering skills and we had a ball. They learned to identify components, apply solder safely, test for unintended bridges, de-soldering, and basic electronic concepts. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect was reading color codes on resistors and then confirming their specs against a multimeter. There are enough exercises to develop a beginner's confidence with an iron quickly (although we used better rosin-core solder than comes with the kit), and one guy decided to omit the last step where you upgrade two resistors to modulate the circuit's oscillation: he liked the faster sound in contrast to his brother's board. All in all, these simple boards provided an inexpensive weekend of instructional fun."
3,Great movies horribly overpriced!,I have mixed feelings about the three Bond DVD sets. I love all the Bond films and own them all on DVD but these sets are so expensive it seems a bit perposterous. In every other country in the world that sells DVDs you can buy the entire Bond 20 DVD series in one big bundle. In fact some bundles even include Never Say Never Again which isn't even an official Bond film. These 20 DVD sets are routnely sold for anywhere from $100 dollars to $180. I bought mine for around $100 with a little extra for shipping. So naturally if you can get your hands on the whole 20 DVD set you will still get the same great quality DVD films for a lot less money.
1,"oh sean,sean,where have you been?","i don't know if anybody mentioned this(ihaven't read all the reviews)but why is it these movies aren't released in box sets according to the indiviual actors who played the secret agent?you know,a sean connery set,a roger moore set,etc.for years i've been yelling for a connery set(whom i consider the best,though they're all good)but to no avail.as many times as they've released these,you'd think they would've done so.therefore i was dissapointed when these collections came out.please give us a chance to pick the bonds we like,without throwing them all together."
1,Money sucking package,"Now, don't get me wrong here. Every single film here is a classic, but the sentiment behind this package is pure greed and, as far as I'm concerned, this pack is a waste of time. In England, you can buy one DVD box set that contains all of the Bond films (Special Editions too!), plus you get one bonus features disc. I can't imagine anyone would prefer to have three separate boxes sitting one on top of the other when they should have every Bond film in one box. I'm going to wait until a PROPER Bond box set is released."
3,"Great for the avid fan, but some stinkers in here","This is the first of three boxed sets to be release in the United States containing re-issues of every Bond film. I am a long time fan of Bond films and received this first volume as a gift. The remastered audio sounds great, especially on the older films.My opinion is that in the forty year history of James Bond films, there have been some great movies such as Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me, and Golden Eye. There have also been some pretty (hopefully) forgettable offerings such as The Man with the Golden Gun and Liscense to Kill. This boxed set contains examples of each. If you are planning on owning EVERY Bond film, I would really recommend the box set. If, like me, you don't necessarily want a personal copy of Moonraker, I would save money and buy the remastered selections of my choice."
1,MWGG is defective,the man with the golden gun cuts out half way through. wondering what I can do to get a new and full copy of the movie? Other than this the DVD's are awesome.
4,Great Bond collection,"Weather you are a Bond fan or simply love spy/adventure flicks this collection is for you. Some of the better bond movies are included in this set - Goldfinger just to mention one of them, which I think is one of the best Bond films ever. Set is priced very nicely too. For [a moderate amount], you are getting hours of entertainment any time you want (man that sounds like a sales pitch). Can't ask for more then that.A very nice addition to any DVD collection"
3,pretty good but the next set is better,"I mean come on this collection isn't as better as the next one because this set only has three good bonds like TSWLM,GF and TMWTGG.But the four bond movies in this set are not good and they are Dr.No,LTK,GE and TND.I suggest you get the next set volume two because this one has some defects."
2,"James Bond Collection, Vol. 1","Although I'm not sure who's at fault, I ordered all three volumes of the James Bond Collections, from three different sellers. This seller failed to include the box for the set, which angered me. I was pretty sure that it did not say in his description that the box wasn't included! He is purchasing the movies individually and selling them as a box set (to command more money)and to me that is very misleading! I wanted to have all three box sets and ended up with 7 seperate Bond movies without the box! I won't ever buy from this seller again!"
3,Great Collection but dated now,Great collection but there are better versions available now and even on Blu Ray! I would skip this unless you can't find a newer version of different format such as Blu Ray.
3,The good movies were omitted from the serie,"The serie has the following movies only:Dr. No (Special Edition)Goldfinger (Special Edition)The Man with the Golden Gun (Special Edition)The Spy Who Loved Me (Special Edition)License to Kill (Special Edition)GoldenEye (Special Edition)Tomorrow Never Dies (Special Edition)The other movies are not included in the collection; like From Russia with Love and Diamond are forever. Originally, the 007 movies were supposed to be seen in sequence; this serie violate what was planned with the whole James Bond movies. I wouldn't recommend spending[$$$], on such a marketting gimmick to milk the series for dollars."
3,not as described,"my box set did not contain ""the spy who loved me,""licence to kill"", or ""tommorow never dies'."
3,Was OK but didn't come with right movies.,"I recieved this and the box wasn't even the one shown and the 7 movies that are included where scratched up and the movies weren't the right ones the movies should have been Dr. No Goldfinger, Man With the Golden Gun, The spy who loved me, License To KIll, Goldeneye and Tommorow Never Dies. The ones That I got where Goldfinger, Thunderball, Live and let Die, For two eyes only, License to kill and Tommorow never dies and goldeneye. I was mad."
3,A little bit worn,THe box was a little bit damaged and worn but the CDs seem to be OK. A couple of smear marks.
5,Great Movies but question about the collectors booklets,"I love these movies; however, in my box set the ""collector's booklet"" is missing in Goldfinger and Tomorrow Never Dies. Has anyone else experienced this?I didn't purchase them from Amazon and have since returned them to the shop where I did get them and got another set with both booklets (for the same films) missing again!Now I would like to get them from Amazon but I don't want to be missing these booklets. Has anyone else gone through this type of thing?"
2,"Should be titled ""Double O One Third""","Come on production people!!! When are you going to think of the consumer and not just some marketing scheme. If you are going to produce a James Bond ""Collection"", it should be a COLLECTION. Let's see the ENTIRE COLLECTION (including Never Say Never Again (from a different studio and seldom included in the true count of Bond films), and grudgingly Octopussy, too(every great idea is entitled to a boinker now and then). I have collected them all on VHS and many are beginning to show the same fuzz an old towel grows after a few hundred washings. Just put the whole thing out there so I can invest once in a PROPER COLLECTION. If there was ever justification for a COMPLETE COLLECTION of any films it would be 007!!! Albeit these are 7 of the best, they are still only ONE THIRD of the man we call BOND, JAMES BOND!!!"
2,Price is Ok but why get stuck,"If your off to start collecting Bond movies for the first time then I guess this isn't a bad way to go. But I don't quite get the choices for this set. Why not a Sean Connery or Roger Moore set? This isn't even a best of bond collection, though many of the good ones are in here. When you buy a set you almost always end up paying for two or three dog movies to get the good ones. The best thing about this set is that it is a fair discount over buying these titles piecemeal. Pick your own favorites if you have any and you'll be a winner. Might be a nice gift though."
2,"Defective ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" DVD","""Tomorrow Never Dies"" disk has a small camera icon followed by 1/2 that is present on screen during the entire movie. No explaination and have never seen it before on a commercial dvd. Does not appear on previews or other disk displays. Whatever, it makes the disk unviewable. Not found on other disks in set."
5,A great set of movies,"The Special Edition Collection has seven great movies at a good price. I don't know what jcorti's on, but 7 DVDs at $107 is not bad. I don't know if jcorti has any special connections, but the rest of us pay about $17 per DVD. $17 mutiplied by 7 DVDs is $119. It's only priced at $107. Maybe I have got it wrong, but if that box set has seven DVDs that is not a bad price. Keep guessing jcorti."
4,"A Good Set, but has defects","I got this for X-mas and let me tell you, you won't be disappointed. The DVDs (from best to pretty good) are ""Dr. No"", ""Goldfinger"", ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", ""Goldeneye"", ""The Man With The Golden Gun"", ""Licence to Kill"", and the not-so-good ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". If MGM adds ""Thunderball"" and ""Live And Let Die"", this will be the ideal James Bond set. The only problem is the defective ""Man with the Golden Gun"" DVD. As many people have acknowledged, chapters 21+ are scrambled picture and audio. Other than that, this is a good set."
4,Extraordinary Portrayal,"Kim Chernin offers a heart-felt portrayal of matriarchial family history, using both her mother's unique voice and her own. Eloquantly and honestly written, Chernin sits the reader at her mother's (Rose Chernin) feet to experience first-hand the stories told in her mother's house. Born in Russia in the early 1900's, Rose speaks through Kim simply, with exquisit detail about life in the Russian Pale of Settlement, her families move to New York and her alliance with the communist party. If for no other reason, this book is worth reading purely for the portrayal of Rose's voice."
2,Bland,"I really wanted to like this book; the reality is that it was just boring - slow moving, with no real excitement. If you're a Clevelander the references to familiar people and places are endearing, but it wasn't enough to hold my interest."
1,Review Outdoor Motion light,I am afraid I put the light up and worked properly for a week and no longer functions properly.
3,Look at the Picture,"I'm looking at the picture which shows one bulb hooked to the motion sensor. If you don't have independent control of the two lights in the fixture, the right light will need to remain on in order for power to get to the left light's controller, or you will need to buy an adapter to control the other light. Does it make sense to leave one light on to have the other light turn on with a motion detector??"
2,Buttermilk Powder,This product does not come with measurement directions so you don't know the ratio of how much powder to water to mix. I contacted the seller twice to request direction with no response.
5,Powder,I wish I could find this product locally because it's not a Prime item. It is great for baking bread in the bread maker. It's a must have staple for bread and other recipes.
4,Good product,The product is exactly what they advertised. Origin noticed indicated several days to deliver and arrived in two.
3,Buttermilk Powder 1lb,I thought this was going to be a bigger bag. I think I will check out how much they sell the name brand dry ranch mix at the big box store because I was underwhelmed.
1,Pure Rubbish from an Entrenched Elitist,"John Kassebaum and I wrote a thorough refutation of every one of Barth's key points in a later issue of Skeptic. Unlike Barth, we will not charge readers for our material. Just locate the hydrino list on Yahoo! Groups and browse the Files section there to obtain the refuting document."
3,look elsewhere for info,"This is a well made video from a production standpoint but it spends most of its time rehashing basic ww2 wartime history and provides scant info on Germany's weapons research, plus it has lots of not at all factual editorializing on Germany being a very bad dog naughty Germany and those camps blah blah blah. A waste of time and money if you already know the basics about ww2 and the V1 and V2 German missles, but were looking for more detail on the technological achievements of ww2 Germany."
3,Not Really What It Claims,"This DVD is 53 minutes long, and probably 10-12 minutes actually talking about the V1 and V2 rockets. Mostly filler footage, which is OK, but I as expecting more about the ""Secret Weapons"". For the price you get what you pay for."
1,Died after warranty was up,"I just got of the phone with Samsung earlier and my dvd/home theater is dead. My warranty expired 4 months ago. It is going to cost $150.00 to repair the unit, and I just paid a little over $250.00 when I bought it. It worked great until it died this weekend. All other tv components are plugged into the same surge protector and they work just fine. I bought this at the same time we bought a Samsung DLP tv. Samsung would not cut me any slack on the repair cost. I suggest you skip this product and buy something different. Next time we will probably skip buying any Samsung products."
4,Interesting and refreshing approach,"I worked through this book several years ago and I remember enjoying its style of pointing out an interesting property of a particular function, and then showing, step by step, that a whole class of functions have that property; that is, the theorems are built up from examples, instead of the other way round. I also think each step was quite manageable - there were no big gaps where I was left scratching my head not knowing what to do. It is not meant as a reference book, as you're more likely to find sketches or hints to parts of proofs, rather than complete proofs. I don't know if it's ever been used as a text book, but if it were, students couldn't just sit back and absorb knowledge - they would have to figure things out (with the benefit of lots of pointers to tell them what needs figuring out, and hints about how to do it), which is just what the book is intended to encourage."
3,Standard Pen,"This is the standard pen that comes with your Lenovo Tablet PC. It lists x60, however it works perfectly well with my Lenovo x61 Tablet. Fits well in the laptop holder as well (just a little tighter than the last one I feel).Bought this to replace the one that came with the laptop. A little irked to pay $45 for something like this...Just remember, do not stick this pen into the holder if the 'right click' button is damaged/broken. The internal mechanism uses this to somehow keep the pen in place and if broken, the pen gets stuck inside and you need to open up your machine."
2,Easily broken and overpriced,"I had one of these for about 2 years. It broke twice during that time period, very early (like 3-4 weeks) the gray button snapped forcing me to wrap a piece of scotch tape around it so that it would stay on and work. Later on, the big plastic piece on the back actually snapped off. Both times, the infernal pen got stuck inside of it's little place on the laptop. The first time (the grey button) it required unscrewing the laptop to get it back, I would imagine someone not as good with computers would have had to send it in to Lenovo.This pen isn't worth more than $20.00 max.Lenovo, listen to your customers: INCREASE the quality, or DECREASE the price."
3,As described,"The product is as described. It's the Lenovo tablet pen, and fits into the slot on the laptop. Have had no issues with it thus far."
5,Works grate,"Works great, just coppied a few files down before getting this and figured that it would be a little bit of work but no.... Just put it close to the screen and it started moving the mouse, clicking works great. I do wish it had a middle click right now but that's about it."
2,Necessary evil,"As a Lenovo X61t tablet user, this is the standard pen. They are total rubbish and break constantly, but there's really no other compatible option."
5,love this!,"This face wash I love. It smells good, feels good, makes your face feel fresh. Is gentle and mild. I've tried lots of different facial washes, I am sticking with this one for a while. I alternate this one with a more medicinal one... Medicinal at night, Zia Aloe and Citrus Wash in the morning."
3,I knew this much,"While this is a complete guide, I already seem to have known (or could surmise based on experience) most everything contained in the book. Heretofore, I've only sharpened knives on a cheap hardware variety carborundum stone, but that, apparently, teaches you a lot about technique."
5,Exceeding Expectations,"Over the years, I have read innumerable articled on sharpening tools using several different systems. I thought I would not learn much from this book. WRONG! There is great substance here. I have been learning much especially about the science involved."
3,Not much on sharpening knives,This is an amazing book. It teaches you to sharpen damn near everything but only has about 3 pages on sharpening knives. If your main interest is sharpening knives pass on this book and just Google knife sharpening.
3,Not a how to book,"I was looking for more of a how to book. This book does have a lot of information, different angles, types of stones and hones, and a method of sharpening for any edged tool or knife. It just doesnt really show how to do it all."
3,Assumes alot.,"Has allot of good information, but it assumes allot of prior knowledge on tools, and sharpening. It takes reading and re-reading to understand, the pictures are not very Helpfull."
2,why cant people make these books interesting,"The book is too broad in scope and may be more useful for craftsman. I was interested in learning the best way to sharpen knives, kitchen, huting, etc. The book goes into much detail but in no logical order. I will continue my search for an easy to understand manual on knife sharpening."
2,Not Impressed,I cant understand why this book got so many good reviews. I prefer something more straight forward when trying to use a learning guide. For instance using more charts and a matrix guide with all the information. The book also seemed to be dated in the equipment and tools that he used.If you are looking for a quick guide this book is not good. If you are looking for a long read then its an ok book. You would be better off just going on the net and getting more useful info.
4,Against All Hope,"My review for both the product and the seller is 100% positive! The bookthat was ordered was exactly as described, and the seller responded inshipment in a very timely manner. I rate all as 'excellent!'"
1,Complete propagandist hogwash,"This tome (while imaginatively translated) is no more than a facile fabrication underscored throughout by a clear anti-Cuba political agenda. Read this book if you remain hooked on the Cold War and need ammunition as you continue your backwards march into battle with a long forgotten, inconsequential enemy."
5,Sequel please!,This was a great read-a-loud for my daughter and I. She even did a class diorama book report on this book to encourage other students in her school to give it a try. We love that this story demonstrates that greedy people always get their due!
2,"For a documentary called ""2012: Science or Superstition"" It lacked real science.","The theories put forth by this documentary tended to be badly explained and sources were very rarely stated. Phrases like ""I'm sure most scientists would agree"" and repeat use of the term ""Ancients"" in referring to ancient and dead cultures in a spiritual reverent sense hinted extensively at a lack of actual scientific founding. There were a number of different opinions, but I found very few debunking, though the simple thought of ""What qualifies the Aztecs and other cultures as having any ability to see into the future? The ability to make a calendar without a telescope?""In short, it was mostly pseudo-science with the gaps filled with logical fallacies spoken with a mystical reverence or outright ignored."
3,Not the research I had expected,"Since High School I have been interested in Mayan and Aztec history and archeology, and have read extensively on their cultures. Though this 2012 DVD was somewhat interesting, it did not contain the in depth research I was hoping for."
1,2012,"Too shallow -- touching upon a potentially serious issue in a very superficial, mass-interest evoking manner. The interviews with marvelous individuals present their perspectives on the topic in a too disorganized, random, out-of-context manner, resembling some sensational news when a reporter interviews witnesses/experts, inserting for the all-believing public the most unimportant and un-revealing sentences taken out of the larger context, thus intentionally blurring the essence of the concept/ideas those people try to convey. Nothing is really developed in-depth. Thus the DVD becomes ""a sound and a fury signifying nothing."""
2,A bunch of opinions,I expected a little more from this video. Instead it presented a bunch of opinions from several points of views.
1,old news,"The information in this CD is ancient news ..., Maybe 10 years ago I would of had something different, but at this point of time science is a looooot more advanced than it is portrayed in the 2012 documentary....Truly a worthless buy."
3,2012: Science or Superstition,The production leaves a lot to be desired in that it is somewhat boring. It leaves the viewer with several open ended questions never really addressing the subject of the video.
1,Worthless,"Ignorance is not a point of view. Superstition is ignorance. Ergo, this is worthless.The video features an array of self-styled experts telling us about the Mayans, the allignment of the heavens, and doomsday. But there is nothing that remotely passes for empirical evidence. The Mayans were a primitive people without knowledge of the wheel. a primitive people who sacrificed humans to please a series of angry gods. And then the Mayans abandoned their cities in the jungle of Yucatan. And we are supposed to believe their doomsday prediction that ""scientists"" have interpreted to be coming on December 21, 2012. It reminds me of the Y2K nonsense, the warnings that computers would fail and airplanes fall from the sky when January 1, 2000 arrived.I watched this video to the end, so don't tell me that I didn't see it. I'm not boasting, just stating a simple fact. Which is more than this video does. So save an hour of your life. Sort your paper clips of something else that is useful."
5,All comedies should be this funny,"I thought the film was fantastic. I am a big fan of dead-pan humour and this film-maker did a great job. One could almost believe this was supposed to be a serious film.This film will have you rolling on the floor laughing.This comedy film does for millennialism what the comedic films ""Hell House"" and ""Jesus Camp"" did for xtian fundamentalism."
1,Doesn't work in Australia,"Unfortunately, the DVD will not play at my house as it is not multi regioned. My fault for not checking this before I made the purchase. Still very disappointed."
2,Ive seen better,It is ok to watch. I've seen better 2012 CD's It could happen and will happen. But the Bible Says (No one Knows the time or Hour).
4,Good quality,Replaced my old ones for these and they are good quality. I have tried too beat them up and they are still going strong. That was two months ago and I play hard about 30 min. daily.
2,Not ball end strings,"If your dulcimer uses a ball end string, then the D'Addario J64 is not want you want. A description telling whether strings are, or are not ball end should be added."
2,Kind of the wrong book.,"As far as I can tell, the material of the book is the same as the one shown in the picture, but the book I was shipped is a special version only to be sold in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. It's a different number of pages and looks different, but I suppose it still has the same material."
5,Good Condition,The book is in great condition. Packaged nicely and...uniquely as always. You won't be disappointed. This book is very helpful because the class I'm taking now is super crazy!!! It does a good job of laying out the information and helps supplement the lectures. I would take a look at the any other recommended amazon products too. I found and purchased a secondary book that my class listed off of amazon.
1,Not the best book,"This book is very hard to read because of the way it is formatted, and it spends a lot of time on proofs, and doesn't provide to many examples. Even the examples they provide they don't explain very well and include to much extraneous information which makes it difficult to understand."
2,dont buy this version,"Go buy an international version which is a lot cheaper than this, and they have the same contents. This version is also printed in Black and White and the paper is really cheap. Don't make a mistake like me buying same product for 90$ more. Again, the only difference between hardcover and softcover(international ver) is the price."
4,camp kill yourself,"this cd is one of the best i own. the range of the style in the songs is surprising. the cd goes from a heavy ""rio bravo"" to a melodic and more mellow ""sara's mask"". this is more than just a band connected to jackass and bam, it's a great rock band."
3,Great fit,I use this for my little chi when i give her a bath so she doesn't bite me. She can still breathe but it's not on long. I would recc this for small dogs.
4,Does what it should,"The battery works with the laptop, it holds a charge nicely, and it fits in the docking station. What more do you need?"
3,Dell battery,Battery recieved in excellant condition and works fine. Although I was under the assumption that it was a genuine Dell replacement battery as opposed to Generic.
3,Worth the dollar I paid for it,"Honestly, I only bought this book because I am an Ozzie and Harriet fan. David Nelson wrote the intro for the book, and that is by far the best part, as he tells what it was like growing up with Ozzie and Harriet as his parents. He has nothing but fond memories of his parents. The rest of the book is probably more interesting if you are raising children, personally I was turned off by the author's attitude of 'your kids are going to screw up unless you keep them on a very short leash'. My parents tended to be more trusting of me when I was growing up, and I stayed out of serious trouble for the most part."
1,"Great concept, poor quality","Bought this for our trips to the Texas coast. We have to haul our stuff down a long boardwalk (quarter mile) and then maybe 100 feet of beach. The first wheel fell off in the sand at the beach. I tried to nurse it back but the other wheel came off at the first turn in the boardwalk.You might think I overloaded it. But you would be wrong. I had a beach bag, a bag of plastic sand toys, two beach chairs and towels. Not much.Not sure what the problem was but the plastic wheels sheered off at the hub."
1,Junk,"I ordered this as a perfect cart for the beach. Of course, this thing has cheap plastic wheels and by the second use the wheels were coming off of it. Don't waste your money. I can't return the thing since I didn't use it at first, it sat for about two weeks. The first time it was fine, I put a small cooler chest on bottom and our towels in the mesh bag. It was a little hard to drag through the softer sand, but not too difficult. On the second use, about a month later, the left wheel got all wobbly and wonked. Now it's useless.Update: Since this review I have managed to get the cart fixed by going to Home Depot and picking up two 8"" garden wheels and replacing the wheels that came with this product. They slipped onto the axle rod perfectly. Now the cart works nicely. Of course, I had to spend $20 on the wheels..."
4,Useful for many occasions,"I was very much impressed with the rio sports wonder wheeler, we just went to a concert where you had to bring your own lawn chairs and instead of carrying them around all day at the park we were able to just put them on the rio sports wonder wheeler along with all our other bags. Great item! I like to keep it in my car to load all my groceries and make one trip into the house instead of a dozen. Thank you for a useful item."
3,"Helpful, but not ""wonder"" ful.","I have a 2 year old that I take to the beach by myself a lot. I purchased the Wonder Wheeler to help me with all the stuff I need to bring to the beach. The positives are that it absolutely frees up your hands and let's you carry more than you would without anything.Negative is that it doesn't move very easily through the dry sand. The heavier the load and the deeper then sand, the more difficult it is to pull."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Not very interesting, it seems. I may give it another chance some time.Presumably this is meant to be a grand, sweeping space opera, but Icould not get interested in the setup, the aliens, the protagonists, orany of the setting, so just found this rather dull."
5,Magnetometer reference text,"Ripka has written the best and most comprehensive book, to date, on Magnetic field sensing. We are a manufacturer of leading edge fluxgate magnetometers and I consider this required reading for our new engineers. A ""must have"" for the reference library of any engineer working in the field of magnetic instrumentation.Bill Billingsley, Billingsley Magnetics Brookeville, Maryland"
5,one of my favorite books,"Travel book that not only details the author's journeys around the world, but also back in time, to find the origin of Coleridge's famous poem about Xanadu. Very interesting and readable, I have read it three or four times now, always with pleasure. Readers who like ""The Road to Ubar"" (another fabulous travel/detective story) will like the ""Way to Xanadu."""
4,Tracing a Poem,"I'd first run across Caroline Alexander's writing in connection with Ernest Shackleton. An upcoming trip to Mongolia, and seeing her name as authoress, impelled me to buy this book.It doesn't have much to do with Mongolia - it's an exploration of the realities behind Coleridge's opium dream ""Kubla Khan."" As such, it's a fascinating piece of on-the-ground literary detection. An armchair traveller's delight, she writes well and writes about interesting things. I'd always thought ""Kubla Khan"" to be pure drug-induced fantasy. Not so - there were real places behind the descriptions. It was an age in which Europeans were journeying to all parts of the world for the first time - and coming home and writing about it. Coleridge had plenty of material and Ms. Alexander takes us on a wonderful journey to the origins of his fantasy. Highly recommended."
2,Not worth the price,This unit has a hum and eventually a squeal when left on. there is no on/off button so you have to unplug it to stop this sound. muting does not resolve the problem because the sound is from the unit itself. on my unit the bass just fizzles out something must be blown inside (the speaker is fine). I would recommend looking somewhere else for your stereo needs. the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the speakers alone are good quality and perform well when hooked to another reciever.
5,The best well-kept secret,"You probably know this is not one of the fancy brand perfumes -- and that's a plus. You'll walk into a place and people will tell you how good you smell... and, chances are nobody else is wearing the fragrance. I love this perfume and hope they never discontinue this product."
3,death of an old flame,"when a calculating software expert is found murdered in his home with two separate gunshot wounds, George Kelso's investigation fans out to cover the victim's enemies, who in Paul Ott's case happen to be quite numerous. Kelso and his partner Smith trade wisecracks and theories as they race to find the killer."
3,Dean Martin concert series,"As a Dean Martin fan a lot of this material is available on other releases, but to have them all together in one clean dvd, I'll take it, and I enjoy having this dvd. I am pleased that the interest has been generated for the producers of this dvd for its release. Dean Martin was one of the best performers of my time. Jerry"
3,"Good, but SALTY!!","After having some awesome black forest ham in Europe, we came back and began a quest to find some in the US. In case you're not aware, the German/European variety of this ham is completely different than the American counterpart - see here: [...] for a full description.This ham looked like it was going to be the closest bet, so we bought it assuming we'd still eat it even if it wasn't exactly what we were looking for.It arrived very quickly and packaged in ice - that was nice.The flavor was smoky and good, but man, it's some salty salty stuff. We almost didn't think we'd be able to eat it, but we made it through it, and our arteries are only slightly the harder for it. I don't know if we got a bad ham of if it's always this salty, but we won't be ordering it again. (We have a friend who's a salt fiend - he adds tons of salt to everything, and even he said it's overly salty).Maybe it'd be okay to cook with, but in such large quantities it doesn't really seem feasible."
3,Nice shirts -- but they're cut HUGE,"These shirts are a great deal, and are nicely made (in India and China). But be warned: I bought 12 of these shirts in my normal Large size, and I neglected to try one or two on before I dropped them off at the cleaners. After they got back I tried them on: EVERY one of them was gigantic -- I would say at least a size, probably two sizes, too large. So if you are a Large, at least go down to a Medium, or all your shirts will end up by the side of the trash-bin too."
4,An excellent resource that deviates from the formula.,This book is not your standard Monster Manual. They have done an excellent job of giving each of the adversaries within a character of their own. It is rich with campaign ideas and helps to provide something that many D&D campaigns lack: repeating and interesting villains. All in all it is an excellent resource in an excellent product line.
4,Good Book For New C++ Programmers,"The 'C++ Cookbook' is a great resource for any developer that might be new to or still mastering the C++ programming language. Packed with over 500 pages and broken up into 15 chapters, this book is well written and easy to follow. My main ""gripe"" with this book is that when I think of a cookbook, many times it's full of solutions are less well known, or slightly more challenging tasks that the average programmer might not know the solution to. With this cookbook, I feel it's geared more towards the more junior level developer who isn't a master of the language and is still learning their trade. I don't feel that this book is perfect for senior programmers, but it DOES offer common solutions in one book, so I might be incorrect in this assumption. All in all, a solid book, and one well worth keeping on your desk and you code with C++!!**** RECOMMENDED"
1,Newbies Beware,"I will start by saying that I am by no means an experienced programmer. In just starting out, I wanted a book that would show me some sample programs that I could use to ""learn by doing"". With the C++ Cookbook, I was very disappointed by the overuse of programming vocabulary without any explanation or definitions. This book is definitely organized for more experienced minds with specific development problems in their paths. It is NOT for anyone just getting into programming. Maybe if you've tried other languages and want to step into C++, this could be helpful. Regardless, I still have a little bit of a problem with how they present the different builders and compilers. They give a great many options but if you're not familiar with them, they don't give much direction on how to use them.To be clear: stay away if this is your first foray into computer programming."
3,Why is this information so hard to find?,"If there's a growing number of single women thinking about, and having, children on their own, why is there not more information readily available to them? Where are the support groups? Where on the Internet can people find kindred souls? It turns out you have to *pay* annual dues to join the national organization run by Jane Mattes and get on her e-mail lists.By all means, buy the book as a starting point and give her royalties. But, I'm waiting for the day when someone with some time on their hands and a more altruistic spirit can create a space online where women can sort through issues together without lining Jane's pocket in the process."
3,Old and outdated,"check when this book was published it is kind of old and outdated information. Also, the book is sort of written assuming that you are having a hard time as well as those around you with your decision to be a single mother by choice. I never had any issues nor did any of my friends or family so that part was a waste for me, I thought that it would give more guidelines as to how to explain it to your child not the people around you."
3,More than a Glimmer of Hope,"As a 37 year old single woman who has just decided to ""seize the day"", I found this book extremely comforting from the perspective of someone about to make a decision that is not yet completely ""accepted"". The contracts are a bit trite, though, and more information on fertility clinics and freezing known donor sperm would have been useful.It is also not legally that useful to someone in Canada."
3,was expecting more,"while it is sitting on a shelf it is ok but it is just cheap plastic and not what I was expecting. with the price I should have expected plastic but when I read ""Die Cast"" in the title I was thinking it would be metal."
5,1/6 scale Blown fuel Mopar Hemi engine,"Its in my shop with my street rod and other rat rod and race car projectsthese make a great display and the quality and detail is fantastic....There is nothing I can say here that can upstagewhat you see on TV with this engine,I go back to the stock block days then the KB 417s and nowits a whole new world out there and the 8000 HP est andwhat it takes to run these is really something....In 66 there wasn't any thing aftermarket much, not like todayand the learning curve was fast and well done as youcan see on ESPN most all year around."
1,Does not ship!,Item has not been received after 4 weeks. I tried calling and very difficult to get through. Cannot rate it yet.
3,"Awkward reading, like something your grandfather wrote in his shed.","The book starts out expecting you to know all about My Laiand what happened. I didn't so I had to go to wikipedia just to knowwhat the hell the first part of the book was about.After the human story about Mr.Thompson, it goes intodetail about My Lai.80% of the book is about him being ignored and the struggleto get him his medal, not about what happened that day. That amounts toperhaps 2-4 pages, so if you are looking for a recount of his day in my lai,his feeling and motivations, half the book is pointless.They should have called the book ""Hope you already know everythingabout My Lai or you will be confused""."
5,Unforgettable,"I am 58 years old, as a small boy my mother gave me this book (original edition). It was my favorite book of the hundreds available to me (very literate family). Would love to get two of the original editions for my grandsons.. Hate to give up my copy which I still have after 50 yrs....Proabably 5/6 yrs old interests different today than in the mid-1940's but I would still recommend this book as a great imagination stimulas for a small boy."
3,"Good book, poor print lineup.","The book is great, but the printing is cut off on the left hand pages, shouldn't have been sold as 1st quality product."
2,Not That Great,"I bought this book hoping to use it in the classroom. I was so disappointed. It is extremely long that a student gets bored with it after just a few pages. The storyline of the book sounded great, but I did not know it would be written with difficult syntax structure. The illustrations are not very interesting to younger kids either. I think this book would only be relevant to those very very very interested in the U.S. expansion and to those who want a challenge of trying to read through each page for comprehension."
1,nothing new,"Unfortunately there's nothing new in this book. buy some handmade paper, tear it in strips, and glue it to something.The most creative projects are buried in the gallery- you may get some ideas there."
3,Death By Chocolate. 60's kisch meets poetry,"Death By Chocolate is almost a harsh name to represent this type of music, perhaps 'living through caramel' would be more appropriate. The sound basically intertwines the poetic musings of Angela Faye Tillett with kischy 60's grooves, a combination of Stereolab's melodic doo-wop harmonies, The Bees/The High Llamas' retro experimentalism, with a touch of Japanese cheekiness, eg, Pizzicato Five. Glossing over this is the tinted haze of 60's soundtracks, complete with cheezy keyboards, a boxed yet cheery colorful sound. I must admit, although interesting, I'm not exactly a fan of the spoken-word vignettes which dominate half the CD, yet the strength of the music itself is a creative force making it worth a listen. Think beat poetry meets Russ Meyer soundtracks meets Rainbow Quartz label bands."
3,Hans Rott (1858 - 1884): bruckner's student,"Hans Rott was born in Vienna in 1858, and he died in 1884, to early age. Hans Rott was the favorite student of Bruckner in the Conservatory of Vienna. This work has the teacher's notorious influence Bruckner, as well as of Wagner's music, therefore, it is a sample of the music of its time, it conserves its beautiful passages as well as other passages recurrent brucknerianos. Mahler had the opportunity to know this work and it was positively impressed. This work was interpreted for the first time in the year of 1989. In general, it is an advisable work, with the warnings already formulated."
5,A blow-by-blow recounting and reconstruction,"Researched and written by Civil War expert Paul Taylor, He Hath Loosed The Fateful Lightning is a dramatic study of the September 1, 1862 Battle of Ox Hill during the American Civil War. Set during a violent storm with lightning and thunder so loud it overwhelmed the noise of canons firing, this unplanned conflict between North and South in a Virginia plantation called ""Chantilly"" would extract a terrible toll from both sides. A meticulous, exhaustively researched, blow-by-blow recounting and reconstruction, He Hath Loosed The Fateful Lightning is an impressive and enthusiastically recommended addition to any personal, academic, or community library Civil War Studies collection."
5,Highly recommended,"This book is an insightful look into the person rather than the wrestling announcer. A lot of his inner thoughts are told through poems and short stories that he scribbled throughout his life, and the accompanying photos were perfectly placed, making this a great read. If you are looking for wrestling material, there's some, but don't go into this one expecting to come away with an education on the business. Nope - you'll come away with a better understanding of who Solie was. Highly recommended.GeorgiaWrestlingHistory.com"
4,A must read for any new Atlantan,"If you live in Atlanta and wonder why its Briarcliff becomes Moreland when you cross Ponce, why Marta [stinks], or why even now this vibrant city seems so segregated, you need to read this book. It is an enlightening (if at some points dense) view of the history of Atlanta from the perspective on race and especially for my generation (those who grew up after the civil rights movement) it is a book about the side of race relations you can not truly fathom until you are able to put Atlanta of the past together with Atlanta today."
1,This book is a lie!,"I am shocked. I went to the bookstore to find some books in sign language for my preschool students who were deaf. I was thrilled to find the titles, then livid with rage at what I found between the covers. These are not true signs. These aren't even invented signs, these are gestures and body language. I am iffy about teaching hearing babies sign anyway, doesn't seem to be a need for it. But if you are going to write a book about using signs with infants, at least have the decency to use actual true signs that are used by the Deaf community. What you have here is an insult to them, as well as a lie to the customers who buy your book thinking they are teaching their children sign. Instead, they are teaching pantomime."
1,ridiculous,this just makes kids lazy when it comes time to actually learn words and phrases. this is such a total waste of money and time.
3,Not quite what I expected,"I was looking for a book with more useful everyday signs, like ""hungry"", ""tired"", etc. This book is good for identifying objects like ""cat"", ""book"", ""hat"", but not great for helping baby tell you what she needs."
3,Wonderful idea!,"Since my Grandson just started learning ASL in day care, I thought this would be helpful. The format is great -- thick pages that he can turn himself. However, more common signs should have been included -- like ""Mother"", ""Father"", ""hello"" and ""goodbye."" What use is the sign for ""hat"" when most babies hate wearing hats!!"
1,Most disappointing purchase ever,"I was looking for a basic sign book that would help me communicate with my infant daughter. Things that relate to feeding, sleep, etc. would help me greatly. This book contains about 15 signs for things like bird and flower. Now how does that help my daughter communicate her needs? She has yet to need a bird or flower. Dumb book, I'm extremely disappointed."
4,My baby loves it,"My little guy has learned about half the signs in the book and is so proud of himself when he does them. It seems like looking at the pictures of the babies signing gives him incentive to learn. When he does the signs he is so proud. It's a fun book to read to him, and introduces a few signs that are simple for him to learn. Not all the signs are so useful, like 'hat,' but it's an easy one for him to do."
1,Another expensive (baby) book,"This book was not at all what I expected. It's simply an overpriced baby book. I thought this would help me to teach my son how to better communicate, well the words used in this book are so simple--I didn't need to spend the money to teach him what he already knows."
2,Doesn't follow ASL - don't buy,This book doesn't go along with ASL so if you are teaching your baby other American Sign Language flash cards and other items - like i am - then you give them this book - it doesn't match - so i got rid of it - it's worthless - waste of money - i was very disappointed as I bought other baby sign items at the same time.
3,Disappointed...but OK,"I guess I should have looked a little further before ordering this Baby Signs book. I was looking for something that would help my daughter communicate her needs, such as ""Hungry,"" ""Thirsty,"" and ""Tired."" This is not that book. This book has signs for ""Baby,"" ""Flower,"" ""Dog,"" ""Ball,"" and other similar signs for animals and such. Nice, but not useful for our first venture into signing. On the plus side, the book is nice and sturdy, the pictures are great, and my daughter did enjoy it. I will try to find one that has the actual signs that we need in it."
3,"Good pics, word selection lacking","I feel like the words I would find more useful were not included- milk, more, water, etc. The drawings and explanations are good, these are just not the words I would have chosen."
1,"unbelievably poor quality, no information","I am returning this video, it is the lowest quality production I've ever seen, and has NO information that isn't better stated on the internet at various sites. Those involved with this should be embarrassed. And the film of the zombie's smoking Salvia will set Savlia back seriously. This should be withdrawn."
5,Rare Salvia Divinorum Footage,"Great video! Rare footage of people actually taking Salvia Divinorum Extract! Reminds me of the old acid trip movies of Timothy Leary in the 1960's. Also has some great information you can't get anywhere else! Production & sound quality is a bit low in some places, but overall this has got to be one of the coolest underground videos I have ever seen! This is a must for anyone who is into Salvia Divinorum and other psychedelics! Two (green) thumbs up!"
3,patient ears,"I was disappointed the first time I heard this CD, but only because I had heard his Melbourne set on DI internet radio. That set rocked, and so I went out and bought the album without listening to it. The contents of the CD were totally different - darker, slower, and some of the tracks just seemed to drag. However, my appreciation for it grew with repeat listenings. The mixing is good, and I found I just needed to listen to it with patience. The degree of patience you have can mean the difference between being bored and hearing the songs unfold gracefully. I really like the last track, ""Slide."""
3,A slight depature from his usual,"The beats are a little slower on this CD. For every Dave Seaman CD I have I always found a song that is off the hook but this one just didn't have that same style or groove. If you buy the limited edition you will have third CD that is multimedia,a film, some photos and bibliography of the CD. This third CD will not run on Mac's. The CD's are housed in a rectangular box(two CD's side by side)so it won't file into your rack because of it's irregular shape. If your not ape over Dave Seaman then skip the limited edition."
1,Waste of money,I own all of the Global Undergrounds and this is by far one of the worst. Tenaglia in Athens is right beside it. Don't even attempt to dance because your ten seconds of joy will be shot down or should I say brought down. I could only find a few enjoyable songs and the rest were just blah.
3,So so,"Narrative is not exciting. Was waiting for something great to show but was disappointed when the story begins. Also, it tends to be boring to watch."
3,Cool Video,"I have many videos of just goals from England. Goals Galore is a bit different from them because it has a music soundtrack running in the background. Some of the goals are spectacular. The goals are from somtime around 1989. The last goal is pretty cool. Arsenal was on the road at liverpool and Liverpool just needed a tie to win the title. A Arsenal player takes the ball in the last seconds of the match and runs down the field to score the dramtic game winner. This goal ranks as one of, if not, the greatest English goal ever!I always watch this tape. It has a pretty high re-watchablity rating for me. But it is just goals. Just one angle, no replay, and not a lot leading up to the goals.I love the English announcers. They all sound like Eric Idle. They say things like, ""Simply world class!"" and ""Brillant goal!""Come to think of it. I will go watch it now."
2,"Lots of Goals Alright, But not Enough Time.","The running time on this video is short, can't remember how long but another reviewer said 20 minutes and it sounds about right. Lots of goals (all from the English Premier League) are cramped into this tape; so needless to say you don't get replay, slow-motion, or even plays that lead to the goals on some occasion. Some goals are spectacular, others are pretty ordinary. It'll be a long time before I view this video again, I simply have better ones in my collection. Like ""Boys from Brazil"", that video is awesome!"
3,Makes firm cheese. Not allergy-free.,"Got it for home cheesemaking. I add it to barely warm non-ultra-pasteurised store-bought whole milk, let it sit for an hour or so, for it to dissolve, stirring occasionally - and the result is more cheese, higher protein, less fat. makes very good cheese. My husband enjoys it. Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction from this powdered milk, so a warning people with food allergies: it's not a ""pure"" product."
3,"never got it, was refunded quickly though","Ordered it, but they didn't have it in stock, luckily they promptly gave me a refund."
1,ham attric,way to saltee and would not take it back because of amazo will never buy at amazon againthat all ok nont order unless you like salt
1,Technically challenging music out of Imai's reach,"This recording was very painful to listen to. I know the Kashkashian recordings of these wonderful sonatas, and this recording does not even come close to that one. The playing was very scratchy throughout, and it sounded like she needed to practice them much more. The octaves in the Op. 31/4 were out of tune, and were way too heavily vibrated. Most of the difficult spots sounded as if Imai just simply didn't possess the technique to execute them successfully. The whole disc sounded like a student attempting (unsuccessfully) these works."
1,Not good.,"I bought this expecting it to be able to activate HotSync without pressing the HotSync button like on other usb cords, but I was wrong. This usb cord only allows you to charge the device and nothing else. It doesn't even show up as a mobile device in the computer menu. I am highly dissapointed with this product. i own a Treo 650 and was trying to update the software on my phone, but I wasn't able to because there is no HotSync button nor no automatic HotSync in the cable. I disapprove of anyone else buying this cable, as I have had many problems with it."
5,Cute,I use it under a bouncer. My husband noticed a bouncer made marks on our hard wood floor so I ordered several cute small rugs from Amazon and it works very fine. It is one of the cute rug I like. I haven't washed it yet but seems ok for machine wash.
1,Less than satisfactory,"Bill Robertie's book is a book on 25 openings. it provides less than no details on how to use them, and only goes 5 moves into the main lines. If you are a beginner and would like to learn more about chess openings, this isn't the book for you. If you wanted to get this book it would be because you would like to learn the absolute most you can about openings, including Robertie's. If you want to learn more about openings try Nunn's Chess Openings (Everyman Chess Series)."
4,"Basic, but good.","After about 15 years off, I started playing chess again about three months ago. I did so badly -- I couldn't beat my PalmPilot at the easy level! -- I realized I needed help. Alhough unrated, I would probably clock in somewhere between 1000-1100 (According to the Chessmaster 9000, anyway. Take that as you will).I've read two of Robertie's books, this one and ""Winning Chess Tactics."" Both of them deserve the same review:Although this is a very basic book, it's PERFECT for a beginner like me. He starts out with simple concepts and then builds up, and spends his time teaching the basic ideas, whereas other books emphasize material too advanced for a beginning player.Quite a few typos, however."
1,frustrating,these openings would be great if the other player played the exact moves that are in the example. I wish he'd shown examples of what to do and why if the other player deviates from the examples.
2,Good for beginners (maybe),Not terribly deep or thoughtful. Limited variations. Good if you have no familiarity with the openings.
1,Waste of money,"This was one of the first chess books I bought, and the last I will ever buy from Cardoza Publishing. It seems to be written for an absolute beginner, which while not automatically a bad thing, is not really the best thing for an opening book. At the level this book is written for, the readers opponents will be deviating from the book very very early, and in many cases the author does not explain why these other moves are bad. The only thing this book is useful for is learning the names of the openings, which can be easily done for free on the internet. Even absolute beginners should save the 10 dollars and either learn tactics, or if you must have an opening book, get the far superior book by Yasser Seirawan with the same name. I highly recommend his entire 'Winning Chess' series actually, it will take the absolute beginner very far and prepare him for more intermediate books."
2,Skip it.,"The book offers little to no detail, mainly focusing on the most simple main lines of the openings, skip-it and get a better book."
2,Bad construction,Cheap results from a cheap product.Because of the way it is constructed when you insert a cd it catches on both sides of the sleeve and you have to pull back and make sure it does not catch on the sides. Very irritating.
4,Christmas treat with a twist!,"Just read it, it will touch some people more than others, but l really enjoyed it because Mr. Evans can write beautifully!"
3,Disappointed,"I found this book difficult to read. It didn't capture my interest in the same way that ""The Christmas List"" did, for example."
5,Christmas Box Miracle,I have just recently started reading books of Richard Paul Evans and they are very good books. The book was in great condition and arrived in good time. Thank you!
5,Wow,"At first I wasn't sure what to think, as this isn't a novel. All I can say is that I'm glad I took the plunge. I couldn't put it down. It filled me with hope at a difficult time. Well done, Mr. Evans."
5,This is the BEST book I've ever read.,"Even if you haven't read ""The Christmas Box,"" and don't know what it's about you should read ""The Christmas Box Miracle!"" It's the most inspiring, and moving book I've ever read. I hope you take the opportunity you've been given, and read this awesome book. It will change your life for the better."
3,Okay,The book was about how The Christmas Box came about and lifes struggles that come with trying to make your dreams come ture.
3,not what I thought it would be,this story hardly held my attention. as much as i've heard about it i expected so much more. the author thought it was greatguess I must have been asleep.
3,enough is enough,"First of all i really loved the christmas box and the other 2 novels that continue the tale but I think it is time to let the christmas box go. Although I really like several of the stories i was some what disapointed, at the end of the book i felt like i had somewhat been let down. I think that authors don't need to let us know about their books. the books are enough. it is a little silly if you think about it. Authors who write books about writing books it feels a little repeditive."
3,"Well Written, But Somewhat Boring","I got this for Christmas. My mom picked it up thinking it was a Christmas book, but after reading it I realized it was a religion book. It was well written, but boring in my opinion. I do compliment Richard Paul Evans on being able to share the tragedies and triumphs of his life.This is a good book for anyone interested in spirituality. But, this is NOT a Christmas book, so don't get it if that's what you're looking for."
5,Tiny Miracles to Bless our Lives,"My heart has been deeply touched by the many stories and experiences that have been shared in this book. Under our nation's circumstances, I can't think of a book that is more healing than this one. It helps us remember, that indeed, we are all children of a merciful God, and that because he loves us, he sends us tiny miracles to bless our lives. This book is a small representation of those miracles. IT IS A MUST READ. You will see things in a new, renewed light, and you will recognize that hope, and peace, and good, will always prevail. Mr. Evans, thank you, again, for helping us recognize these tiny miracles that help us see the ""big picture""."
5,"Great Book, Nice Step by Step with Screen Captures","I have been using Deramweaver since release 3, but finally decided to buy a Deramweaver book. I bought this book after reading that it contained instructions on how to secure a site as well as using MS Access for dynamic asp pages.Wow! If only I had bought this book months ago, I would have saved a lot of time.What I really liked: nice screen captures; step by step database access; how to use extionsions including shopping cart; basic security; dynamic data access; css.... Just to name a few.Good job guys!"
1,Its useless,This book is useless. The scope is so broad you are only fed with minimal info on each subject. I strongly recommend you DON'T but this book.
1,Working without a strategy,"Wade Cook's methods work primarily in a raging bull market. His overoptimism about the potential for massive returns threw his company into bankruptcy and destroyed many people's financial futures. Try the Motley Fool (who predicted Wade's current downfall back in 1997) or another more credible source whose company isn't bankrupt and isn't losing money by the hour and isn't being sued by multiple states. Despite what this book says, don't trade on margin. Don't put a significant percentage of your income into stock options. Wade only provides weak information on options strategies and provides no real information on how to predict the movement of a stock."
1,Perdict the future and win big! Is that all I have to do?,"Ask yourself why there are so many of these used books for sale for under a buck! In a nut shell the strategies in this book, and it restates this often, rely on buying on a low and selling on a high or selling high and buying low. Duh! If anyone could do that they certainly wouldn't need to read any books on making money. The books states that the only ""risk"" is the risk of ""lost opportunity."" WRONG! If the stock purchased for the covered call goes to zero then all you have left is the premium for selling the option. So the losses could far exceed the potential pay off. In other words, lots of risk for a small fixed reward. Now name the billionaire that made money like that? But don't loose sleep trying.If you practice what the book teaches and find you are not loosing money fast enough then take some more of the books advice and trade on margin."
1,1 star as it is a required field only.....,It is a shame but i bought this book (in a real store - so sadly it cost more)and none of the math adds up - i have recently discovered that Mr Cook has many lawsuits pending - i do not recommend this book and would question Amazons ability to sell it.
3,Good Concepts -- Lots of Advertising,"While the book has many good concepts, timing of the strategies is not discussed, and wade plugs his seminars every chance he gets taking up pages and wasting time."
5,Wade Cook is BACK! That explains 1* reviews.....,"Interesting on how so many people here are bragging that Wade Cook is bankrupt. They make it sound like Mr. Cook is broke, gone and forgotten.Sorry to rain on your parade but Wade Cook is back in the saddle again. After a sabbatical from seminars and writing a new book to be released soon, Wade Cook is back in full force (check www.wadecook.org for the facts and not the bull) and will be in 10 different cities over the next three months on his national PR Tour promoting his newest upcoming book.I have been a student of Wade Cook's since the 1980's when I read and used his flagship book ""The Real Estate Money Machine"", a book that made me a lot of money. In 1996 I bought and used Wades stock market strategies in Wall Street Money Machine, a book that was on the NY Times Best Selling lists for 18 months! Again, I made a ton of money following Wade's advice.Welcome back Wade and I look forward to attending your seminars when they are in my area."
1,A really worthless book,"A client loaned me this book to get my opinion of it. This is the worst book on trading that I've ever attempted to read. This guy is selling seminars on trading. Some unfortunate novices probably lost a great deal of money and became jaded with trading. Don't waste your money or time with this book. If you're new to trading, may I recommend Dave Landry's ""The Layman's Guide to Trading Stocks""."
1,Ignores several problems...,"The ideas in this book are interesting, but the actuality is highly flawed. The idea that you can write a 1 month call for 10% of the value of the stock is erroneous. Then, since he advises investing with borrowed money, he claims this is a return of 20% per month. He extends this to 40% just because nobody minds optimism. Writing covered calls is fine, but you do have to realize that this will limit your upside, but not your downside. He neglects to mention this!Mr. Cook uses margin buying for every example, yet never gives a single calculation for what happens when a stock goes down, for example showing how you can lose 100% of your investment by a price drop of 50%. Really, the only three ideas in here are 1. Covered call writing (with exaggerated numbers) 2. Buying rolling stocks (which are not supported by his own graphs) and 3. Buying on the stock split (which is not such a guarantee of success as he claims).Overall, the returns of these strategies are not credible."
2,Grossly over-rated!,"Some very general information, in this and others of the series. Other reviewers are obviously recruited and biased. More useful and realistic investing/trading information and methodologies are available in many other books by experts who are not selling hype and greed."
4,Good book if used properly,"This is an excellent book, I agree he pushes seminars way too much, but there is also good info. I have been using the covered call strategy and have had 170%, 68%, 33%, 50%, 117%, on first 5 trades, I will take those returns any day of the week since anything above 10% is fine. When it comes to investing read as many books as possible and find what works best for you, you will win and loss, but experience will make you a better investor."
5,Now I know Wade is the real deal!,"Lessor authors would have deleted (and usually do) all the 1 star, negativ b.s. reviews. But Wade doesn't. And I recently found out that Wade made over 22% in his trading account while the S&P was down 24%!I just came home from the bookstore with Wall Street Money Machine Volumes 1 and 2 along with 2 Bad Years and UP We Go.Looking forward to a great 2003!!!!"
1,Waste of money. Wade Cook Financial is now bankrupt.,"Unfortunately, I wasted my money on this book. Don't make my mistake. His trading strategies worked great during the bubble, but most anybody's strategy worked during those times. How did he fair when the bubble burst? Answer: Wade Cook Financial filed for bankruptcy. The headquarters and all of its contents were sold at auction. He is now looking into starting a juice company. I'm not making this up. Do a search on ""Wade Cook"" on Yahoo. Within the first 10 search results you'll get all of the information you'll need on Wade Cook. I hope this helps."
5,Excellent Book. Cha-Ching,"This new and revised version of Wall Street Money Machine will turn dormant investments into cash flow. So many powerful strategies. So much excellent information. And a easy read.TIP: Paper trade first and never use more than 2%-5% of your portfolio. Take profits and put into mutuals, blue chips, real estate or tax liens.Always use stop losses and limit orders. Use this information and profit from the prophet--WADE COOK"
2,"Not to be confused with Patterson's ""Mary, Mary""","I've forced myself to read many books because I've started in, found it to be questionable, read a few reviews and decided to go back and give it another try. Usually I've been well rewarded. This time, however, I just couldn't get past the obvious writing from the lower regions.Come on, did you really think I'd believe that an attorney would be hopping into bed with the DA knowing damn well it'd put the hot case in jeopardy? Far more suitable for Hustler. I'm not a prude by any stretch of the imagination, but I found this to be so incredibly far-fetched I ditched it and picked up a great little ditty: ""Pornified."""
2,Something of a letdown.,"This novel is a fascinating read. But, in comparison to ""Three Blind Mice"" it is anticlimatic. And one is left wondering exactly why Mary's twin sister decided to show up at Matthew's house and attack his daughter after the verdict was announced when all she had to do was disappear."
2,Not Happy with book,"It was a worn out book, from a library, and I did not like that I had to pay $11.99 for a used book"
4,Good Information,"This DVD gives a good snapshot of the drug trade and its effects around the world. It seems at times to be one-sided, but it still portrays the situation accurately. Some of the information is outdated but valid. The narrator obviously does not have any knowledge of the Spanish language or South America in general. At times he mispronounces country names so badly you have no idea what he is talking about. Still it is worth your time and money."
4,Phomollient,"This product is a favorite of mine because I have thin, fine hair and it is lighter than most foams."
1,Not for thick or normal hair,"I have this product and it may work wonders for fine hair but please, if you have thick or normal hair just stay away from it, it will make your hair sticky and lifeless. I was also given several other Aveda hair products as gifts and all i can say is that I am not impressed at all with any of them. My colored,normal (on the thick side) hair just does NOT like Aveda."
1,very disappointed,I'm not sure why this sells so well on Amazon. It's sticky and leave my hair feeling stiff. Definitely won't buy again.
4,Good Compilation,"I am not familiar w/all of her work, but found many new songs that I now enjoy. Her music is good for long drives!"
5,Tina Turner's a must.,"I have a greatest hits disc already, but not all of her hits are on it. This one doesn't have One of the Living on it. I was hoping that both songs from the Mad Max film would be, but the more popular of the two got the vote. It's still a wonderful cd. It plays well and I love it."
5,Tina Turner showcase,"I purchased ""All The Best"" by Tina Turner back in January 2010 because of being impressed and curious about the music behind her story. I thought it was inspiring that she overcame so much to experience a career rebirth and courageously start over in a new place simultaneously. ""Private Dancer"", ""We Don't Need Another Hero"", and `Proud Mary"" are some of the multiple hits available in this collection. However, ""Great Spirits"" was one of the songs that greatly resonated with me. ""All The Best"" by Tina Turner is good for those who like pop rock greatest hits collections and/or soft rock."
5,Tina's Best,Ever ever the best for Tina. You can have all Tina's songs you like in one album. Good deal.
5,Gotta Love Tina!,"I was introduced to Tina Turner during the 1980s or as I write the MTV generation when music videos were an inventive artwork in progress. Gone are the days that music videos are even made but Tina Turner resurfaced better and stronger than she ever had before. I bought this compilation at a local supermarket for $7.00 believe it or not. When I bought it, I found out it was two disks. I felt like they were being ripped off because I got two for the price of one. Tina Turner is one of America's foremost songstresses. I love her music especially the song, The Best. There are others like Private Dancer, You Better Be Good to Me, I'll Be Thunder, What's Love Got to Do With It, Let's Stay Together, Proud Mary, 1984, and so many others. Tina, we love you and it showed last year when she was given our country's highest honor of being inducted into the Kennedy Center Honors for her services and commitment to music."
3,"5 Stars for the music, 1 Star for the liner notes","Great CD. A comprehensive sampling of her later solo career. Could have included ""Working Together"", a terrific ballad from 1970 and ""Sweet Rhode Island Red"", a funky tune she wrote from 1974. They are both Capitol so they could have been included to flesh out what Tina Turner is all about. The liner notes only list the songs. In today's times, releases like this include some sort of historical narrative to put the music in a prospective. To see what Tina was doing in her 20's, get ""PROUD MARY - The Best of Ike & Tina Turner."" An excellent compilation."
5,Wonderful Compilation,"I love this set!It's nice to have all my favorite Tina songs in one set. Of her three new songs, Complicated Disaster is by far the best. This is now one of my favorite songs; it's a shame this wasn't released and promoted as a single like the mediocre Open Arms.However, the Complicated Disaster alone is worth the price of this great set."
4,Really Good Collection,Tina Turner is One of the Baddest Vocalist Ever to me. her Range is still strong.Her Comeback 20 years back is still incredible when you consider all she had to deal with&overcome.Her Material covers the full spectrum.she truly Re-Invented Her style&Sound&it worked. this is a tight Collection.
2,NOT THE BEST BY FAR,"Tina's best music was done with IKE. River Deep is produced by Spector and is not real Ike and Tina Turner music. Nutbush City Limits was written by Tina and thats why she can have it on this cd. A FOOL IN LOVE, I IDOLIZE YOU and ITS GONNA WORK OUT FINE are head and shoulders above anything Tina has done since leaving Ike. Tina is the finest woman stage performing musician I have ever seen....her shows with the Ikettes, Ike and the Kings of Rhythym are legendary and are an indelible memory to those of us who have seen them tearing it up in a small club. This cd is NOT the best of this great performer/singer, but its good for casual fans to get exposed to her music."
5,A True Talent!,"JLo, Britney, Jessica, Ashlee...take note!Tina is a real woman and an incredible artist! You wish you were an 1/8th as good!"
3,"A BIG hit off the crack pipe, but some great BG info...","The idea of 6th, 7th, and 8th level spheres gives me the feeling of old-fashioned D+D number-crunching, but the background information on Oracles and Archmages certainly makes the book worth at least looking through. Also, the explanation of exemplars (mages that focus specifically on one sphere) was also insightful and helpful. I think this book would have been a lot better if they had cut out all the Monty Hall-ish arch-spheres and focused more of their time and efforts on the motivations and challenges that face an arete 9 mage - don't make up new arch-spheres (digusting high-level powers that don't flow with the rest of the sphere progression i.e. Forces 8 - Move Continent -WTF?)...Instead, tell me what type of seeking a mage that close to Final Ascension faces... give me story ideas, not silly new ungodly powers that won't realistically come into play. White Wolf can do better than this..."
2,Not his best,"More prosaic than usual for Herr Updike. I find slathering in the mud of disbelief in God and defeatism in life rather depressing...Much prefer his life (or at least sex) affirming books like Memories of the Ford Admin, Brazil and Afterlife"
3,Not Up To Par,"While the episodes are enjoyable, the DVDs are NOT up to par. There is a purple stripe down the screen of almost every episode, some double imaging, ghostly blue light across scenes and audio glitches. Amazon's policy is no return on opened DVDs. While I can understand this, it makes it impossible to return damaged or poor quality DVDs. The cost of returning DVDs to manufacturer cost me another $12.95+ in shipping, so Amazon's price is not really that good. I won't be buying anymore DVDs from Amazon as they are nonreturnable and may not be up to par!"
2,poor quality DVD,I was disappointed with the quality of the DVDs. The first time I played the second disc it skipped or locked up. This wasn't the first time I have had trouble with your DVDs. It wasn't my player because it is brand new and I bought it from Amazon.
4,Niece enjoys register very much!,"I bought this for my niece as an Xmas present and she enjoys it very much. The sounds are very great quality and it opens and closes very well and is constructed excellently for the price.It is also a workable calculator, so it helps the little one with her math skills! Definate A++!"
3,Talking play cash register,"Got this for my girls for Xmas.. of course they were super excited!! It looks good, has what all it says ''but'' we've been having issues with the cash-drawer sticking!!! It seems there is a little plastic piece inside when you push the OPEN button it's suppose to release the drawer...but sometimes it doesn't release :( !! That has been the main complaint coming from my little ones. The 'mic' isn't too loud (good or bad depends I guess lol). The scanner does scan, it randomly calls out ''99 cent"" and ""$4.00 and 99 cents"" (maybe one or two other amounts??).. all in all it's alright (maybe worth 3.5stars) a bit expensive at almost $50.00 for a toy that has apparent issues.."
3,Has Pros and Cons,"ProsIt voices all buttons that are hit, plus,minus,total etc.Accepts credit cards and cashhas a scanner with a red lightMicrophone works greatConsThe scanner only beeps if it scans the barcodes that are provided and lined up VERY SPECIFICALLY. It is impossible to keep the barcodes on the plastic play vegetables and fruits. They dont stick and even if they did and most of the food we have is not flat so the scanner would not be able to pick it up. An improvement would be for the scanner to beep each time the button is pressed.It does not voice money correctly. This is a huge pet peeve of mine because I do not want my child to learn a bad habit.Ex: The total on the register will be $831.29. The correct way to say this is, ""Eight hundred thirty-one dollars AND twenty-nine cents"". The cash register says, ""Eight hundred AND thirty-one dollars AND twenty-nine cents"". ""AND"" represents the break between dollars and cents, not just randomly throughout the number."
1,Don't waste you money!!,"I've called the company 4 times about this product and they keep saying they will send me an e-mail so I can return the cash register and get a new one. Well I still have the old one and my 3 year old cant even open the door, so of course she hasn't played with it at all and it was for her 3rd birthday that was 3 weeks ago . Would not recommend this product!!This is not Amazons problem but the company they purchased it from. I have always had good experience with Amazon."
3,Cash drawer doesn't open on first push,"My children are very excited with this toy; however the cash drawer doesn't open on the first push. It can take up to 5 times of pushing the button to get it to open. The microphone is EXCELLENT, just loud enough. The scanner is very picky as reported in other reviews, if not in the exact position it will not recognize the barcode."
2,disappointed,This was a Christmas present from Santa and we were very disappointed Christmas morning as the cash register drawer does not open as it should. Our daughter was very let down with this gift.
4,looks great !!,"I have recieved this cash register and have looked at it , But have not opened it yet to play with it, as it is for a gift. It also was shipped quickly and packaged well for shipping!"
2,Summit talking cash register,"Scan doesn't work right, when u scan it gives the wrong amount. Door is sticking within first 5 minutes of play. Not impressed."
2,Disappointed,"This item seems very fragile & ""cheap"" for what I paid for it. Doesn't look like it will last long when used by a child. The scanner works poorly. We will try it since Christmas is so close, but I would not buy it again."
3,Not the greatest!,The cash tray was not well installed. It is kind of well designed but got a bad product maybe. Kid's not too happy
4,Awesome buy!,"Everything my niece could want and more! She's 5 years old and has been randomly asking for a cash register. She likes pink so I bought this one. It was also the coolest one I found on Amazon lol. We opened it together and I couldn't believe all it came with. It talks, comes with batteries, money, and a debit card. Has fake scanner codes for you to sticky onto toys, but I also found that it scans some real scanner codes too lol. Awesome toy so far."
1,"If you want to hear good flute playing, don't get this","The flutist has very poor interpretation and phrasing. I know how these pieces should sound and this isn't it. Find another flutest that has more sensitivity to music, such as Manuela Weisler."
5,The book I wish was written when I was in 4th Grade!,"Wendelin Van Draanen rarely disappoints, and the Shredderman character is fantastic. So many young boys relate to a boy without many friends. Nolan Byrd is picked on, and people rarely see through his ""nerdiness"" to really get to know him. He is bullied, and decides to fight back, but in a way all his own. His computer skills and hi-tech gadgets help him in with fight against Bubby Bixby, the baddest elementary school kid in Cedar Valley. A great book for boys that are done with beginning chapter books, and looking for the next step."
5,One of the best books for kids!!!!!,This book is a must read for kids who really want to read something decent. It entertains you the whole story. Wendelin Van Draanen wrote this to perfection. It might not be very long but it is GREAT. READ THIS IF YOU WANT ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Very detailed analysis on its distribution system,"Enjoy reading this book. Using various information systems (including satellite tracking) to monitor the store performance is vital to its success. With 6875 stores in Japan and 47 stores in Hawaii, 1997 sales 1.6 billion yen ($13 million USD), 7-eleven's business is quite impressive. I was able to get hot coffee and danish, 6:30 a.m. at 7-eleven Tokyo last week, for 360 yen ($3.00 USD). McDonald, and all other stores were closed. The book would have been better if it covers its competitors, Lawson and others, in more depth. It is a useful reference book for my Global E-Commerce course, Spring 2003 semester."
5,An Inspiring Story,"This is much more than just the story of how the author survived the horror of being seriously burned over a large portion of his body, although that story of determination and recovery is enough reason alone to read this book. But this is also the story of someone who refused to quit even in the face of a series of setbacks in his personal and business life that would have had most people taking to their beds and pulling the covers over their heads. All in all a most inspiring book and something to keep handy for those times when you're feeling like life is about to get you down. If George Pessotti could overcome the mountain of obstacles that were thrown his way in one short period, so can you!"
5,Obscure but good selections,"This cd has some obscure but excellent pieces on it, particularly the ""Okna (Windows)"" by Petr Eben. The better known ""Prayer of St. Gregory"" and Persichetti's ""The Hollow Men"" are good recordings, and the other pieces are also played well. The last track, Lowry's ""Suburban Measures"" is quite abstract, but interesting. My only complaint would be that the recorded sound seems distant and makes the trumpet less clear than it should be."
4,great record,"Psychedelic trip that has no end...Oh God, I wish they would be still alive and kicking..Amazing sound with no compromises..."
4,Trip out on the feedback drone,"Very stoned sound here. Usually pleasant; occasionally annoying. ""Hey Man"", ""2:35"", and ""O.D. Catastrophe"" stick up a little out of the overall drone. Rest sort of oozes together, which is not a bad thing. Sometimes all I want to hear is the drone."
4,listen to this guitar sing!,this box set is great! there are four cd's filled with rare tracks and takes i have never heard before. there is constistant guitar work throughout the album. it really shows why johnny winter is known for being an amazing blues guitarist.
4,yeah...it's good,"Fast shipping, good price, and it actually works! But the cable is poorly made that i had a hard time to pull it out.(one of the metal triangles thing for somehow just can't hide thourouly unless you press the little button REALLY hard). And when i ejected my ipod directly through iTunes, it just went error again and again. Yet, it's fine if you do it with the mass storage control.(i mean the little thing shows up when you plug in down in the notification bar)So overall, if Apple's 19 bulks' price really annoyed you and you want to save space, buy it and try your luck with the cable quality. :P"
2,"a great idea, but lines are too short",Very fast service. Item is poorly made and broke 2 weeks after I started using it. Real junk.
2,Doesn't charge the iPod!,"I am very disappointed with this purchase. I specifically got this product so that I could hotsync and listen to my iPod for as long as I wanted on my laptop. This should have been possible if this product CHARGED the iPod as it advertised. Unfortunately, it does not so I can only access my iPod on my computer when it is charged. I wouldn't be as mad if the product had been cheap, but with the S&H it ended up costing me quite a bit for a product I don't even need."
1,Faulty,"I use my Ipod at the office and at home and soon grew tired of carrying the USB/charging cord back and forth so I ordered this Retractable USB Cable. It seemed like a bargain, but it was defective. I attached it to the same Ipod and same computer that I use with the other cord. It simply did not make the connection. I exchanged it for my regular cord and there was no problem connecting. I did this twice, on two different computer and this flexible cord did not work. Returns are easy with Amazon so I returned it for a refund and bought a slightly more expensive cord."
1,Does not charge my ipod.,"Doesn't work as advertised. Although it seems to work at first, if I leave my IPOD connected to the computer with this cable overnight, then when I come back my IPOD battery is completely dead. The apple cable works perfectly, but it doesn't retract like this one does."
2,Nice but doesn't work,"This product works on my wall charger, but not with my car charger unless it's held a certain way. I think it might not be good for the cord to be curled up so tightly (and left in my car, but most aux cables can be left in a car and THEY still work).Buy Apple's instead."
5,GREAT for the price! Does everything it says,"I was skeptical about this cable because I had bought one from eForcity a few weeks ago that was advertised similarly. That cable was also about $3 for the cable+shipping, but when I went to plug it in, my computer didn't react at all. That one did charge, but very slowly.This one works perfectly for my iPod 5G and Vista, and the retractable feature is a real plus. Great buy, glad I didn't resort to buying the $20 official Apple one."
2,You get what you pay for,"The retractable cord does not lock in place. It never has. I can still use it, but it's a pain."
3,OK,"The retractability of this device was what I bought it for, but it was cumbersome and I ended up not using it."
3,"So far, so good....","I've only used it about a month and the retractor is still working, however, it seems to be constructed with very cheap plastic. I've only used the product in the car to charge my Iphone and I've had no issues. I can't comment on it's ability to transfer data."
3,It worked for awhile.,"It worked. The connectors aren't very well done, so the plastic starts coming out from the back edges of the connectors after awhile and then the wires start to fray.If I didn't have a Fry's around, I'd still buy 10 for the price of what one costs at Best Buy (and in the future I'd also get some of the rubber things that you put over connector ends and use a heat gun to shrink them into place to better secure it before I started using it)."
3,Worked until it broke.,"This item came in a bundle- but I would not buy on its own.Pros: being a gadget junkie, the idea of less wire due to retractability is a strong selling point- great for the car as well for that reason.Cons: Gets easily tangled. Care must be taken when retracting/unretracting.With just regular use, the wire tore at the point of insertion into pin plug and I had to put pressure on it to maintain a connection.So- If you can be gentle with this item, it may suit your needs."
2,wrong part,"I ordered a master cylinder for my camry. The part number matched, but the part was not the same. No reservoir. I will try once more. The box should have a shipping label and phone number for immediate questions."
3,Slow beginning; picks up pace,"By far, I enjoyed the last third of this book better than the rest. Initially, the storyline was a little slow and I found the jumping back and forth in time (with each chapter) somewhat confusing. I don't think the author spent enough time exploring all of Louis' visions and hallucinations clearly enough and I often found myself wondering if the events taking place were real or simply hallucinations - maybe that was the author's intention. The explanations of the daguerrotypes were interesting, altough a little dry. The plot surrounding Isobel was by far the most intriguing and kept me wanting to read - it was worth it when I got towards the end."
3,Flowery,"The subject, Louis Daguerre was fascinating for me as a lover of photography and a tinkerer with the cyanotype process, pin hole cameras and all things not digital about photography. I think I understood more than most folk would when the processes were described, but I don't think it was meant to be a technical novel in that way. I ended up explaining a lot about it to my book club group. I would have enjoyed it more if there were more historical details as they related to Daguerre and the French Revolution. The plot was compelling, though it was difficult to get into and out of the novel."
2,Didn't live up to the expectations,"I had had high hopes for this book but I was sorely disappointed.The storyline dragged like slow torture and the characters seemed barely two-dimensional.There was great potential in both the storyline and the characterization, however the author missed both marks by a long shot.So many times I wanted to just give up and put this one away but I kept reading thinking (hoping, wishing) it would get better. And it did, but only through fleeting passages. Then back to the same old labored reading.I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because there were definite resolutions to the two main conflicts presented in the story. Had it not been for those much-sought-after resolutions, the whole thing would've been a complete waste of time.If you can hold out so long as to find out how the conflicts get resolved, then more power to you. If not, no big deal. You won't have missed much."
4,Facinating,"I would love to see this book translated into film. Merchant Ivory is the one production company that could do justice to the cinimatic version. But, readers must remember this facinating story is historical fiction at its best, not a factual biography of one of the pivital characters in the invention of photography. With this in mind, I highly recommend ""The Mercury Visions of L.D."""
1,A Dull Disappointment,"The idea of this novel is intriguing but the author's execution of it is not. He was not able to develop any genuiness in the characters and his descriptions of Paris were unconvincing. He throws in some $10 words for effect but that just detracts from an already dry, clumsy and artifical story.If you must, then get it from the library. I wish I could get my money back. Another nicely packaged, back cover hyped disappointment.PSI notice one reviewer calls this book ""masterful."" I find that astounding. To me, it was more like something written by an over-ambitious, under-talented high school student."
5,Caravan's finest.,"This would be Caravan's finest hour. Keyboardist Dave Sinclair and bassist Richard Sinclair are both present for this inspired set and deliver fine performances. Musically, compositionally, Caravan would never equal this effort and sadly began an ongoing revolving door with band members that eventually led to a decline in their recorded output. One of progressive rock's classic albums. Highly recommended...Simon"
1,Caveat Emptor - Aquinas It's NOT,"I was reviewing the section on the Sacraments in this book, specifically, the parts on the Holy Eucharist, and noticed that the 'form' (the words of consecration) of this Sacrament is exactly ICEL's MIS-translation of the Canon of the Latin Novus Ordo, and a MIS-translation of the Canon of the ancient Roman Mass. I had to ask ""What did St. Thomas really say?"" I went to several older translations of his work (the Summa Theologica) and this book completely mis-states what St. Thomas wrote. This is important for many reasons, but one of them is that these words of consecration have been part of internal Church contention in recent years when the new Sacraments were issued in 1970. This book should be avoided, but there are others that are more faithful translations, such as ""A Tour of the Summa"" by Glenn."
5,I almost felt I was there!,"I truly enjoyed this book. It was such a pleasure to read about the great care the author put into his daily work aboard the boat. He put great forethought into what his food offerings would be for the crew members - would there be enough fresh vegetables, enough variety, etc. I could almost FEEL how hard he was working when I read this book. I hope to read more books by this person! I love the Great Lakes and her history, and have read as many books as I could find on the subject. This book came to me unexpectedly and it was a great read. Highly recommend."
2,just ok,"was disappointed in taste,quality..ended up giving away remaining packets after trying a couple and none of us wanted to eat...was looking forward to the ease/shelf life, but no one liked"
3,not really a book,"When I picked up this book I was expecting an in depth study on race relations and the segregation that exists in our cities. I was expecting some discussion about the suburbs being for whites only and the ghetto being for blacks only. What I got was a collection of articles and interviews piled together with no main purpose. The 2 or 3 articles about race are very good and very observant. However, the rest of the book seems to be a collection of stories about Upski. He talks a lot about graffiti(and how down he is), but has no argument as to why it is good or bad. This book is worth getting only because of a few articles, besides that it's mainly Upski talking about how cool he is."
2,ergh,"If the cheesy graf styled font isn't enough to put you off, the title should. Guaranteed to appeal to LimpBizkit fans and Ecko/Fubu wearing white kids with no idea how this works. ""Yeeeeah rad dude""."
5,This book's great.,"Everyone I know was saying ""read it read it read it, it's a great book, you'll love it"" and I bought it and I'll be damned if they were right. This book is an awesome introduction into hip-hop, DIY culture, and just plain old self-awareness. Upski has written a book that will inspire you, no matter who you are, and it's definitely worth picking up. I wish he would come back to DC!"
3,white guilt gone wild,"hip hop is a cult. if you're not a practicing member of this cult then you probably won't enjoy this book. if you're not from chicago then you'll probably enjoy it even less. it's very local. i like Upski (he uses his brain!), but this book just wasn't that good. i didn't like the part about bombing the rich suburban areas. i think there should be a place where people can expect to elevate to without being forced to be bombarded with graffiti. graffiti is for cities. it looks stupid and out of place in the suburbs. just cuz Upski likes the cities and loathes the suburbs does not mean everybody else shares that view. people are presently free to live wherever they want (if they can afford it) and if they want to move away from the ghetto they shouldn't be bullied into having the ghetto brought to them."
3,old stuff thats fun,Bought for 70th birthday of Brother in law and he loved it as it reminded him of his youth.....Word word
5,Cute series for children--,"This is a nice series to introduce birthdays to children. Our collection is growing, and the earlier photos are fun for children to look back on. Not much of a true story-line, but a good keepsake that children can play with."
4,First Birthday Book,"I bought this for my niece on her first birthday. Simple story, but has an area were you can write who was at the party and 2 pictures can be added. I thought this is a fun way for her to look back at her first birthday. I'm planning on her getting the other birthday books (2,3 & 4)."
4,Really nice book,"This book arrived later than expected, but it is a really cute book. There is a place to add a birthday picture, list of presents, etc. and you won't be disappointed with this book. My one yr old Grandson is more into eating this book, but loves to be read to. He actually imitates me reading to him when we are finished reading a book.This is a great book as it is also a keepsake of baby's first wonderful birthday."
3,E11506G1,Bought this a few weeks ago and i am quite satisfied. Its big and heavy just what i needed in a guy's watch. Other people has also been complimenting it and for a reasonable price its quite a durable watch. Will be buying more of the same brand watches. kudos to marc ecko watches and Amazon for delivering the products to my far end part of the world.
5,"Hands-down, the best annual sports almanac you can buy.","After sticking with ""Sports Illustrated"" for a sports almanac for years, I made the switch to ""ESPN/Information Please"" for my 1998 choice. What a difference, and the 1999 version is no exception. Packed with every stat & history imaginable. Trust me, you won't be sorry. No bathroom should be without it!"
1,Wast of Money,"I just bought this gadget this month of June 2007. When it arrived, I tested it and it works perfectly, but in the next day when I try it again, it wont work at all... until now still won't work... DON'T BUY THIS IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME..."
2,Too Generic,"I ordered this book last fall after getting my first Rhodesian Ridgeback and waited serveral months for it to come. While the information about the breed is accurate, it is also very vague. The bulk of the material is just generic information that applies to any dog. The Rhodesian is a lovely breed but is, I continue to learn, unusual in its intelligence, agility (especially when counter surfing), and sensitivity. It would have been nice to have the training information tailored to this breed. At the very least some information on finding a good trainer, who uses positive techniques rather that the traditional ones, would have been more helpful. Did like the section of the RR's sense of humor."
3,new pup,"not really what I expected from the book. I could have used a few more prior reviews to let me know that I was actually looking for a book with more information on raising puppies and nuances inherit to this breed of dog. Good book for a true overall picture of the breed, but to much other non-essential information tossed in"
3,General knowledge,"I thought the first 6 chapters of the book were good, the first few great. However as you progress through the book the knowledge it presents is geared towards all dogs, to a point where I don't think that a RR was mentioned in the final few chapters, it was general knowledge about dogs."
5,Love It!,"I haven't read the whole book, but what I have read is amazing. It is just what I wanted. It has the history of the breed, personality of Rhodesian Ridgebacks (RRs), how to take care of RRs, basic first aid, training, etc. The book is an overview (about 150 pages), so you get a lot of info but it doesn't take forever to read. I have had my first RR for a year now and when reading the book it describes my dog exactly; from her intelligence to her humor. If you are seriously looking into this breed, I would strongly recommend you read this book first before making a final decision. RRs are not for everyone, but if you can handle them they are great companions and I don't know what I would do without my RR."
4,Rhodesian Ridgebacks,"The Rhodesian Ridgeback is an extremely intelligent canine full of fun, love, and stubburness. They live to love and be loved back and in return they will be your best friend, and family protector. An excellent family dog as they are very good with children. It takes a special person to raise a Ridgeback as they are very headstrong at times and are not for everyone. The author of this book covers everything you will need to know before you decide if a Ridgeback is for you."
1,Bad packaging...,THe poster was ok but the packaging was awful causing the poster to get damaged during shipment. Very dissapointed !
4,UO at their prime,"Most people will be familiar with the cover of Neil Diamond's ""Girl, You'll be a Woman Soon,"" which featured prominently in Pulp Fiction, but it's just one of several strong tracks comprising this amazing EP. My favorite is probably ""Now That's the Barclords,"" which is close in spirit to ""Sister Havana,"" by far the best song on their subsequent Saturation CD. Both songs sound like distillations of the best of 70's AOR radio, swaggering, bristling with hooks, self-conscious lounge music amplified to arena-rock bombast.Carrying echoes of the Manson murders, the title track refers to a cemetery in Kansas supposedly used for Satanic rituals. The stone structure on the cover of the CD is a church without a roof. According to legend, one can stand inside the church during a rainstorm and not get wet."
3,Directions?,"The trick with smoked or salk cured ham, is you need to skin it then soak what your gunna eat in water for a while to extract the salt. It will still be salty but not as bad. You can always dress it with the tradtional pinapple or brown sugar for that sweet and salty taste. Thin slices also help. I am SOO sorry to hear about your Easter Ham. I had a very similar incident with a smoked turkey for Christmas. It was over smoked and the meat had turned to paste. Hope this helps."
1,what? fck off.,"who actually listens to this crap?slipknot and nu-metal bands pisses over these.""extreme fans"", run before we nu-metal fans kick the SHTT out of u all!HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,not her best work,"I usually love Linda Howard, especially Dream Man and Kill And Tell. However, I thought this book was not developed very well and Rule was too chauvinistic and possessive."
3,A Good Book,"I guess I am in the minority. I liked this book. I have read all LH books. Although this is not one of my favorite, I could identify with the character of Cathryn who was young and not able to handle the emotional aspects of a relationship with an older man and so flees. Later she returns and Rule and she finally get into the open their feelings for each other after some initial wariness and distrust. I recommend this book as a satisfying read."
3,"""against the rules""","I've read it today in VO and I like it. Well, it's not my favorite book of Linda Howard, but the story was not unpleasant and I liked the idea of the heroe named Rule duly affected by the Viet Nam war (not so usual in the Linda Howard's héroes).He's stubborn and vindicative but he loves the heroine for years and never tells her his feelings so she's lost and thinks that he wants her only for lust...Good book"
5,this card game is additing,my son loves to watch the show and as soon as the cards came out he was all over them
2,"Nothing Like Their First Album, Anyway","A clockwork nightingale to the trio's own incomparable ""Nothing Ever Was, Anyway."" The balance of harmonic sophistication and plain lyricism was a naturally emergent element in the earlier outing. I didn't need to read the liner notes' admission of programmatic lack of focus, either; it's just plain inattentive on some tracks and one or two technical blunders spoil a lot of it.These artists are capable of *so* much better; I wish ECM could have afforded another session or two for this album. Here's a deal for you Mr. Eicher: I'll buy another copy of ""Nothing..."", and you turn down the reverb one notch the next time these cats get together."
5,Almost like being back in the past.,"Just listened to my copy, it's in mono,but it has the feel of listening to it on the radio. I grew up in Brooklyn and listened and watched Alan Freed regularly. This cd brought me back. I even like the audience yelling, as it made it feel authentic. It was great to hear the music done live, it has a special feel, especially for me."
5,Moving and inspirational,"As a transplant recipient, I found Joe's poems warm and inspirational. They are the words I would want to use to communicate with the donor family I have never met. Joe tells the outside world, those people who have never had an organ transplant, but are potential donors someday, how important organ donation is to those of us who now share the gift of life. Thank you, Joe!"
5,Amazing book,This is a truely inspirational book. Written from the heart with depth and passion. This is on of my most treasured books. Amazing author.
3,Nice Story - Illustrations NOT by Grandma Moses,"I got this book because it was recommended in our school's art docent program. I ended up donating it to the school because I didn't want any other docents in the future to think that they should have to buy it. It's fine as a story, but I expected the illustrations to be by Grandma Moses...since she's an artist and the book was about her.I did end up getting a few big picture books of Grandma Moses' work at the local library. She has done some phenomenal works outside of painting. My favorites include:The Year With Grandma Moses by W. Nikola-Lisa. It had a simple text on each page as well as a more informative one, so it was great to be able to chose the simple side of the page for my son's first grade class.Grandma Moses: An American Original by William C. Ketchum, Jr. was awesome for large pictures and other art Grandma Moses produced. And the best part was that you can get these at the local library."
2,"Good story, unsettled ending",The book was pretty good. I enjoyed it up until the end when it didn't really end in my opinion. I do not like stories that leave you hanging. I actually listened to the audio and want to add that Chris Noth did an outstanding job of reading it and making it interesting.
1,Disappointing,Certainly not his best work. I was half way through and didn't even finish it. I have LOVED his stuff in the past and this one was a real disappointment.I certainly hope he gets back on track!
3,Expected more ...,Interesting Washington FBI-CIA story that is truly action packed with your obvious good verses bad guy. For me where it fell short was in the development of the characters not in the story line. In order for the reader to fully attach themselves the characters should have have been much better developed and they were not. The story itself is almost over developed with under developed personalities.Still you will find a book worthy of reading. The last few chapters will glide you to the end of this book. Getting there is a bit more difficult.
2,Too bad--I wanted to like this book,"Do you ever ""save"" a book to savor at a special time? I met the author and chatted with him while he autographed my book. I love political thrillers and I live in DC and so was prepared to really like this book which I saved for Christmas week. Sadly I was not gripped by suspense and could not feel for any of the characters. I really did not care if Faith was saved. Too much chasing, little left to the imagination. Kind of like a ""Murder she wrote"" episode"
2,Reasonable workmanship keeps the reader from total boredom,"But honestly, it doesn't miss total boredom by very much.A young whistleblower named Faith Lockwood is under attack by powerful forces for what she's planning to tell. When a private investigator is pulled into the situation accidentally, he and Faith go on the run without any clarity about who to trust.There's some decent writing in _Saving Faith_, but unfortunately it never passes 'decent'. I'd save my pennies for a better book and take this one out from the library."
2,A Huge Disappointment,"The premise of the plot & its ending are totally unbelievable. Even though the characters are somewhat likable - especially the PI, by mid-book I was not that interested to see what became of them. It seems that little effort on Baldacci's part went into this story."
3,Just Ok,I'm not giving a plot summary of this book. It's above from Amazon or one of the other reviewers. This book isn't one of Baldacci's best. It has a lot of holes in it and things that just don't make sense. The two main characters don't click or have that connection. Just wish Baldacci wouldn't have hooked them up. The FBI and CIA not being able to figure things out quicker didn't ring true. Just not one of his best. However it is an ok book.
2,disappointing,"After all those wonderful books, I was disappointed. People always running away. This is getting old. He can do better, because he has."
3,"CHARACTERS SAVE ""SAVING FAITH""","It's the characters, stupid. Borrowing that line from James Carville would only be appropriate for a novel steeped in beltway mischief and congressional insider intrigue. Faith herself is appealing enough, but David Baldacci found his high mark in male heroes in his novel. What's missing, besides a plausible plot, is the pacing and breath-stopping sense of danger that made ""Absolute Power"" one of the few modern must-reads. ""Saving Faith"" is great for the cross-country plane trip or the vacation on a Caribbean beach, but Baldacci has not regained the level of ""Power"" or his second-strongest work ""The Winner."""
2,WHERE IS THE REAL DAVID BALDACCI?,"I find it really difficult to believe that he actualllllly wrote this book! It has the feel of being written by two completely separate writers! The first half was B O R I N G and the last half was exciting! The characters were great, fairly interesting storyline but one that's been done over and over. What happened to the writer who wrote those first two books? Those were simply amazing in every which way! Hope the next one will be back to his old style!"
1,"""Saving Faith""","Baldacci better stick to courtroom dramas; ""Saving Faith"" stinks!, a generic thriller with no original plotting and little original writing; if the author wasn't Baldacci it would be still sitting on a dusty shelf somewhere, where it belongs; save your money for decent books, if you have to read this get it from a library, Amazon.Com will understand"
1,Dull,"This was my first and probably last Baldacci book. I know this author is very popular but after struggling thru this snoozer, I can't imagine why. Very ""by the formula"" thriller, lovely heroine in danger, dashing hero saves her. Nasty villian, corrupt government officials, snore....I felt I'd read this book a hundred times before, and it's been done better. Don't waste your money."
4,NOT RELIGION BUT A WOMAN....,"This book is a slow moving but easyreading that helps keep your interest. At times things getexciting but it is not a pageturner. The same old competitionbetween the CIA and the FBI forfunding and recognition gets a bittiresome. Faith Lockhart is a legal assistant to Danny who hiresLee to follow someone to start thelife and death of Agents (take your pick) as they betray and/orshoot their way up to fame or life's end. It involves Congessmembers vieing for the best gravyjobs after retirement. Someone gets killed by accident, another gets shot by taking the bullet tosave a friend. The reader keeps on reading this to the end and isassulted by a ""They lived happilyever after"" line you won't wantto hear. Baldacci usually writestoo long a story and has troublebringing them to a close. Thatgives it a 3 1/2 star but it isBaldacci so I gave it a 4. The line ""And so he did."" actually rates it a 3. This is a book from1999 so don't rush to read it."
3,Entertaining,"Raeding Saving Faith is like chewing a good piece of bubble gum. You enjoy it while chewing it but forget about it immediately once you're through with it. Baldacci provides enough action in this political thriller to maintain your interest, although much of the suspense and interplay between the characters is somewhat predictable. While I enjoyed reading Saving Faith, it is certainly not among his best books. However, I don't agree that it is as bad as many of the earlier rewiewers consider it to be. If you're looking for light beach reading that is fast-paced, mildly exciting and will hold your interest, give Saving Faith a try. But if you have not read Baldacci before, I'd suggest you start by reading one of his other books --especially Absolute Power."
3,Baldacci Saves Faith but Disappoints Readers,"As a diehard Baldacci fan I consider this book his weakest effort so far. The plot is a little too contrived, the characters lack depth, and overall while the book is a decent read, it is not a thrilling page turner like his previous novels. If you have not read Baldacci before don't start with this one. Try ""The Winner.""It is far more thrilling and much better written."
2,Not even close to his best work.,"This book was a huge disappointment when compared to Baldacci's previous works. Bland characters & constant pontificating about the big bad governmnent. I admire his attempt to raise awareness for the plight of LDC's, but how about writing a readable book & subsequently donating the proceeds. This book reminds me of Grisham's Street Lawyer, more opinion than story. You would be better off rereading Absolute Power or The Winner, then plow through this sub par work."
2,Baldacci Stock Plummets,"I should have heeded the other posts. No, I gave weight to the Amazon review which led one to believe this was much better than it indeed was. Do not disregard your fellow readers. Do not purchase. Don't even waste a library loan on this. Buy something else by Baldacci or another author."
3,Good casual read,"Good story, although a bit slow in places. Faith Lockhart has information that will allow the FBI to put away quite a few Congressmen. Problem is that CIA has been using her boss to gather intelligence on these same Congressmen for their own purposes."
3,Yeah...not one of his best....for a Democrat writer,"Most liberal writers are pretty good at what they do..but this is not one of the best ones of Baldacci's. Skip it...go on to the next one...look for four stars or more. He has a lot of good books, this isn't his best."
1,Struggled to get into it.....,"I think my opening line sums it up. After the first 50 pages, I started it again thinking I had missed something that would have grabbed my interest. But, after re-reading the same pages, I decided it wasn't worth my time......"
1,Lacking originality,"This type of book seriously makes me want to quit reading fiction. I was not impressed with Baldacci's new ""thriller"" at all. In fact it made me do something that I hate doing, fast forwarding (skipping ahead).There is nothing in this book that I haven't read before. For God's sake, the guy names his dog Max! It lacks a unique story that I would have expected from Baldacci--good guy befriends woman in trouble, they fall in love, fight off bad govt. employee, climax at the end. I feel like vomiting the number of times I've heard this plot. If you are a reader who likes reading different subjects, then please spare yourself and skip this book.One final thing...I noticed that on the back cover of this book Dave is smiling--surely this is because of his paycheck and NOT because he has written something to be proud of."
2,"Saving Faith: predictable, disappointing","True enough, David Baldacci's writing style is easily read and sentence structure is sound. Unfortunately, well written words do not a good novel make. The characters and plot were far too predictable for my tastes. I suppose one could liken this work to a poorly researched, Tom Clancy wannabe. Perhaps Mr. Baldacci watched too many episodes of Mission Impossible as a child. The representations of the CIA and FBI agents as a mix of Attilla the Hun and Barney Fife was just too hard to swallow. And really, a drunken, naked, abusive, nearly sexual assault scene? Do books need a sex rating like the movies? I can't deny that I was entertained - I like spoofs as much as the next guy. Unfortunatley, I doubt that the authors intent was a parody."
2,A weak plot,"Being a Baldacci fan I was quite disappointed by Saving Faith. I think that the premise of the plot, a lobbyst turns to corrupting U.S. lawmakers to help third-world populations, is quite unbelivable. The best part of the book is the relationship between Faith and Lee while both the Tornhill and the Buchanan characters are not well defined. The second part of the book is quite predictable and there are no surprises as in Baldacci's previous books."
3,Ho Hum,"Ho-Hum. Strong silent (misfit) type endures much misadventure for beautiful power gal in way over her head with the wicked FBI/CIA types. Of course, she's rich and he's strong. Full of macho gadgets, mayhem, and murder. Are we supposed to believe this?"
3,Audio Voice Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of David Baldacci, this is why I purchased his latest novel in CD format for my long drive to work. The story so far is wonderful. The narrator is terrible. In his attempt to ""act out"" different voices, he makes the women sound like breathy bimbos. This includes the FBI agent. He mumbles so bad that at times I've had to listen so hard that my head hurt. I think Chris Noth (the narrator) was a terrible choice for a usually suspenseful and exciting author."
4,A very good read!,"Mr. Baldacci continues to produce novels that are enjoyable, somewhat educational, but nevertheless entertaining. I have read all five of his novels and would rate this just behind Absolute Power & The Winner. Keep 'em comming David!"
3,Another Great Read by David Baldacci,"I am a big fan of David Baldacci's - my favorites so far are Absolute Power and The Winner. Saving Faith was another good read. I did wish that he had developed the storyline about Lee's daughter more. The bad guys were supposedly after her at one point. Also, and this is minor, but it was never mentioned if Lee was ever reunited with his dog who was wounded at the beginning of the book. Look forward to Baldacci's next book."
4,Fun Political Thriller,"Maybe not Baldacci's best, but still good. Interesting look into Washington politics, the book starts out a little slow, but picks up quickly and soon I couldn't put it down!"
1,I read this book why?,"I have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow. She didn't say how slow though. But rather than take her word for it (why should I? After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it. How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale. I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything. I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food."
3,Couldn't Save the Ending,"An interesting story idea, unravels when the author leaves too many dangling threads at the end."
4,Saving Faith,"Not my favourite Baldacci, but still exciting and a page-turner. I didn't feel as close to these characters as I have in his other books. However, I always love reading about my hometown and is especially entertaining for me to read about my business and my ""coworkers""."
2,Given Up,"All of Balducci's stories seem to have a good premise. Similar to Richard North Patterson. Unfortunately Balducci's stories (except Winner) doesn't read like a Patterson book. Saving Faith actually started out very good, but toward the middle it started to fizzle. I didn't care about the characters at that point. Even though Balducci is a better writer than the other Patterson (James), I think Richard North Patterson is the top guy in his field."
5,An excellent book with an excellent Reader,"SAVING FAITH is suspenseful, intriguing and fast-paced. David Baldacci has woven an intricate tale that delves into the world of politics, the FBI and CIA. An age-old theme of power-hungry men has been skillfully developed into a book that holds the listener captive. The Audio CD with 5 discs is read by actor Chris Noth, who lends his considerable vocal skills to make the book even more enjoyable. He uses the rich tones of his voice, and an ability to provide various accents, for the listener's optimum benefit. Mr. Noth's style of using pauses, along with varying his speed, inflection and volume for emphasis, helped keep me fascinated with the story until the end. I found myself not wanting it to end, but ready for 3 or 4 more chapters at least."
1,If all his books are like this . . .,"I have never read a Baldacci before, and I can't say that I'm sorry. I always read books thorugh even if I don't like them, but this one has been painful from the start. I'm sad to say that I will not be finishing this one, and that I will probably donate it to the public library. Obviously Baldacci's other books must be better, or we wouldn't be a bestselling author. I have found Saving Faith to be confusing, somewhat boring, and lacking a hook to get me interested. I'm about 50 pages into it and I still don't know what the whole ting is about. I think I'll stick to Grisham for crime thrillers."
2,Takes Effort,"Fbi, Cia, lobbyist on capitol hill, murder, romance, espionage, all in this book. Should be exciting, right? Wrong. The end picks up the pace a bit, so just skip to it and don't bother with the beginning. Mr. Baldacci must have cruised on this one."
3,saving faith,"This was a long awaited book I liked his previous books Absolute Power, The winner and Total control. This book seemed predictable in places. There was also suspense in some areas. If you like this author you won't be totally disappointed, it;s just not as captivating as his other books."
2,Saving F aith,"This book was a disappointment compared to others I've read by this author. Very draggy, too much in the way of descriptive thoughts. I thought I'd never get through them. Lots of wasted words."
2,TO SLOW!!!!!!!,"The first David Baldacci book I have read and if I don't change my mind will be my last. There was some few very good pages but most of the pages seemed to be just talk. People would spend page after page talkng about what was gong on or thinking and talking about what had happened to them in the past. Much to slow moving for me. Also to unbelieveable. I think things do go on in our government that are wrong but this is so far out it is unreal. No need to talk about the characters as I did not even finish the book, yes, I did give it a chance, read to page 300 and thought that was enough. Very, very slow moving!!!!!!"
4,Faith needed to be saved...,"Look! There on the shelf! Is it a political thriller? Is it a spy story? Is it a techno-thriller? Yes to all of the above! I've yet to be disappointed by one of Baldacci's books, and this one is no exception. At times, though, it seems he's having to work really hard to keep the suspense building, rather than just bringing things to a conclusion.All in all, a great read."
4,Baldacci Delivers,"Had read ""The Winner"" and I admired Baldacci's characters and the way he rounded them out. ""The Winner"" took some time to get to it's twists which is also true in ""Saving Faith."" This time, however, you can see how the author has grown into his genre. There are a couple of good twists but you can get a fair sense of where the story is going but it is not disappointing because the plot is very satisfying. Highly recommend this for addictive story telling and a book you are almost sorry when you get to the (more or less) happy ending."
3,A disappointment for a Baldacci,"This book didn't hold my attention as strongly as the other Baldacci books I've read. Somewhat of a disappointment. The book takes off in the beginning with a good storyline and a character I like, but later she behaves inconsistently with her character description, as do many others. This left me constantly wondering who they were and what their purpose was. The book ends neatly enough, but not without some effort on my part to reach the last page."
1,Big Disappointment,"This book didn't begin to meet the quality of ""Total Control"" and ""Absolute Power"" or even ""The Winner."" There was little mystery or suspense. The illegal government conspiracy plot was boring and hard-to-believe. The government, FBI and CIA characters were not developed into people that were interesting or worth caring about. The ""love"" story between two of the characters was on the level of a cheap dime-store paperback romance novel."
2,Having trouble sleeping?,"I have been a fan of David Baldacci's writing since his first novel Absolute Power. Each of his subsequent novels were high octane thrillers which kept me glued to the page. However, Mr. Baldacci has certainly slipped down a few notches in my estimation of his talent, with his latest book. This story is patently predictable from the start, and there is nothing new here to make this book worth reading. Didn't anyone at Warner Books bother reading this before publishing it? I experienced some trouble finishing it, but it was only because it kept putting me to sleep."
1,Utterly Disappointed!,"I have followed Mr. Baldacci's books from the beginning and was looking forward to his newest. I found the more I read of ""Saving Faith"", the more bored I became. Too much detail went into the political agendas, and not enough into the three main characters - Lee, Faith and Buchanan. I wanted more suspense, not just two or three lines every few paragraphs. I don't think that I will be buying the next hardcover, because I feel that I have wasted my money on this one."
2,Made it 'til the end,"There were a few times that I almost put the book down on the ""couldn't finish it"" pile, and I fell asleep once while reading it. That has never happened to me before. I believe the reason is that I had a good idea what the ending would be, and there was a lot of tedious information on Lobbying. But, what bothered me most was the amazing coincidence in the book that broke any belief I had in his story line. This was also true in ""Simple Truth"". I am now reading Carl Hiaasen's new book ""Lucky You"", also dealing with Lobbyists, and I know it is a total farce. I am having an easier time accepting all the absurdities in ""Lucky You"" than I had accepting the single coincidence in ""Saving Faith""."
2,Not up to Baldacci's Earlier Standards,"This book is overblown (too much writing about each incident or item). This book is not very credible (too many 'shazam' escapes, no credibility of the villain's role in his organization...who is his boss?, why is he able to act so independently in what we all know to be first and foremost a cumbersome bureaucracy?). The hero is too 'magic'. The women are too pure-hearted. I was disappointed."
2,disappointing,"Usually a fan of Baldacci, I felt let down by his latest book, Saving Faith. The characters were not developed to the point that I could care about them. The plot was the same old corruption in govt by right wing wakos and the little guys who find them out. Better luck next time Mr. B"
3,Misfire,"Too much opinion, not enough story and character development. Certainly not up to this author's usual standards, but that's not bad."
4,Entertaining summer read,"This is not War and Peace however, it is an entertaining read to occupy your mind during relaxing times. There's too much realism in the world already, this was an interesting story, with a happy ending. What more could you want from a fun read. When I want real life drama and depression, I turn on the TV news stations."
3,Somewhat Interesting,"I'm somewhat disappointed in David Baldacci after reading ""Saving Faith."" To begin with, the storyline is somewhat far-fetched, yet too familiar. At times it seems like we've been down this road before.Robert Thornhill is the classic conspirator that all conspiracy theorists live to find. His use of CIA resources to top the FBI is the stuff that people in Montanta cabins dream up. On the other hand, Danny Buchannan, the consumate Washington lobbyist, in his zeal to save the starving world, gets tangled in Thornhill's schemes.Enter Faith Lockhart and Lee Adams, the beautiful heroine and manly savior, respectively. After Faith runs to the FBI for help, she is unwittingly cast in the middle of a fight that she's not quite sure of. Adams appears as her guardian angel.The ending leaves the reader somewhat hanging, leaving us to wander whether Baldacci is considering a sequel.Overall, I will say that I was somewhat disappointed. The work appeared somewhat forced."
2,This one a disappointment,"I have purchased all of Baldacci's hard covered books and enjoyed them. ""Saving Faith"" is his first let down and disappointment. The plot became muddled and it was an effort to finish it. I will think twice before I invest in his next hard covered book."
1,"Possibly, the worst book I,ve read","Ouch, thats a pretty bad title but I paid a whopping 8 bucks or so for this alleged thriller and was determined to finish it.I have put it down at least ten times for many reasons, 1, it really stinks, 2,very poorly written,3, lousy boring plot 4,naive horridly constructed characters 5.He,s really written a few books we,ve all enjoyed and now is doing it purely for dough.Oh, well, ;its better than getting maimed in a car wreck, or a huge bill from the IRS or your Dr. saying,""oh, this doesn,t look too good"" while reviewing your lab work, or various types of std,s.Uh, that would be sexually transmitted diseases and is too much of a low blow to count but its what came to my slightly demented but highly educated mind at the time.Avoid this book.Thanks"
5,Great book,"Great book I always enjoy Baldacci Books cant wait until ""the forgotten"" comes out on the 20th. Cant put them down."
4,it wasn't his best...,"I bought this book b/c I have read other books from Baldacci and I enjoyed them. Although you could tell he knew what he was talking about, in certain parts, the details made it slow reading. How the situations worked out was very gripping and I enjoyed the action/adventure parts. There were interesting unexpected turns. I like his style which is constant through out all his books."
3,It was okay,"I'm still confused on how Faith and Danny did what they did. Not much character developement and suspending disbelief seems to be a major prerequisite for this book (and the narrator was horrible). But there are a few surprises and not much else. Overall, not a very memorable story."
1,not too good,"This book is pretty boring and not very well written. Baldacci's writing style is flimsy, awkward and fairly transparent. He uses a lot of words and basically says very little. His characters come to conclusions that make them sound like they are in sixth grade. Also the whole CIA vs. FBI thing got very dull and tedious. I found it virtually impossible to believe that the CIA would ever employ someone so incredibly stupid and arrogant as Thornhill. Don't waste your time with this horrible book, if you have some extra time on your hands and want a good suspence novel re-read Michael Connelly's: The Poet."
1,Diane Yannick,"David Baldacci, you should be ashamed of yourself! This book is wretched. How dare you write a book so convoluted and stupid. I will never trust your name again. I bought all of your other books in hardcover and enjoyed them. I wish I had never bought this one period. I did not care about any of the characters or the plot. How dare your editor let you think that this was ready for your readers!"
1,Saving Faith,I have enjoyed Mr. Baldacci's previous books but this one has been difficult to get through. Previous reviews have captured enough of the plot for me to figure out the conclusion so I think I'll quit reading while I'm ahead. Complex and boring!
3,"Fast Paced, fell a bit short","This is a classic thriller, that fell a bit short for me. I can't understand why they had to chase down Faith, the lead female character.It seems to take a few too many twists and turns and I got lost in a few places. Baldacci set this up to be a good story, but wasn't able to drive it home for me. He's got better stories that this."
3,NOT AS SPECIAL AS SOME,I DIDN'T FIND FAITH VERY APPEALING. SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS ALWAYS ONE STEP AHEAD TO CREATE MORE PROBLEMS FOR LEE. I GOT REALLY ANNOYED AT HER LACK OF COOPERATION WITH HIM.
2,What a waste,"All I can say is the plot is week, Baldacci has started to go formula writing and not very well. Very, very disappointing"
3,"Solid read, moves quickly",A fast paced read that has some pretty cool turns. At times it can be predicatable and I did question some of the decisions that several of the main characters made; but overall a good summer read.The characters are written in more fo a two dimensional nature then I would like. I would love to have them flushed out a bit more but given the limited space I can understand his decision to go the route that he did. The ending is a bit disappointing and leaves a few questions dangling up in the air.
3,Fun read,"Though it does have some corny love scenes ~~ it is a gripping mystery read as well as a jab into the lobbying's lifestyle. I do know that though I love visiting Washington D.C., I have no desire to live there!!Faith is a lobbyist whom Lee is sent out to investigate and to protect. Little do they both know how fast and how murky the web ensares both of them ~~ Faith's boss is being blackmailed by a prominent figure in the government. There are the expected twists and turns ~~ but none so breathstopping shocking!It is a fast read and entertaining enough that you can't put the book down right away. It's definitely a book to read on a long plane flight ~~ it'll keep your mind on the book. Baldacci doesn't disappoint ~~ as usual."
2,Weak II,I agree: Weak!Not NEARLY as good as his previous works. Wait for paperback or the clearance rack for this one.I hope Mr. Baldacci gets back on track with his next effort.
2,Wait for the paperback,"or better yet, get it from the library, so you don't spend money on it. I had to force myself to finish it. I like his other books, but this one let me down."
2,Not even entertaining,"I have liked Baldacci's previous books because I liked the characters and I thought the guy wrote good stories. At times I began to think that his story hooks were a little too frequent, but then I realized they were all exciting and really perfect for the 'made for TV' style of nove. This book, however, had characters that, despite a lot of time with them, were never developed. The dialogue was comical in its simplicity and idiocy. Would you ever be completely angry with, upset with, suspicious of, and afraid of a complete stranger (both vocally and internally) one minute and then be pouring out your heart within two minutes? Well Baldacci thinks you would. I will not read another Baldacci book unless a very large number of people assure me that he has returned to his former talent. Otherwise I would feel like I was watching my life tick away."
3,"A rather typical, though entertaining page-turner.","David Baldacci's latest work is typical of his other writings: high paced, technically insightful, and demonstrative of the author's intimacy with human emotion. Yet ""Saving Faith"" fails, perhaps, to deliver the tension that runs through some of Baldacci's other works. The plot is entertaining, yet not unpredictable. Still, there is much that is redeeming: characters are portrayed vividly and in such a manner as to attract the reader's sympathy, and the general flow of events keeps on interested in discovering 'what comes next.' All in all, a fair addition to the genre."
2,Samsung missed the mark,"For the money, the sound from the front speakers on this unit is excellent. However static from the rear wireless speakers is noticeable at normal and low volumes. I have attempted to reposition the wireless receiver without success.I was also disappointed with the number of commands that can only be done through the supplied remote and the wireless speakers in the back still need to be wired into the wireless receiver.After a two week trail I am sending this unit back. The static is a deal breaker for me. A $300 HTiB unit will suit my need just not this model."
3,Ignore Mr. Dey,"He obviously doesn't know how DVDs work. DVDs contain layers and if the content on a DVD is longer than what's on a layer, the laser must start reading from the new layer. When it does this, there is usually an every so slight delay of video/audio. Some players are better at ""changing"" layers than other but they all have that ""skip"" effect."
3,Will not work with one remote with samsung tvs,"i bought a 4755 tv and a wp38 hts hoping to be able to use one remote for both. the tv remote will not even allow you to enter a code for the wp38. i am very dissapointed with this system. i have to use at lest 2 remotes and at times 3, 1. tv,1.dvd, 1.for cable box. better think twice."
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed with this instructional video. I found it to be of no use to me. Instructions were not clear, and I wasn't able to follow. Save your money. My granddaughter taught me the dance within 15 minutes and for free."
2,Didn't like the music,"I felt that the instrucions for the dance steps in this dvd were good, but the music was awful. It would have been better if he has used ""real"" line dancing music to go along with the dances he was teaching. I would have liked to hear the ""Electric Slide"" and ""Cotton Eyed Joe"" as I was learning the steps."
2,Line dancing video is annoying.,This CD is so annoying to me. Too repetitive and boring. I expected lessons and then actual music to dance by.
2,Disappointing,This DVD is for someone who has never danced a step. He goes into great detail about how to do each step and there is no real dancing.
2,"Good for light exercise, not for dancing.","The dances taught on this DVD are outdated and hard to adapt to real-life dancing situations. If you've never lined danced before in your life you might enjoy this DVD, but if you even know half the boot-scootin' boogie, buy something else."
2,Why buy what doesn't apply?,"I ordered three of Shawn's Learn to Dance dvds, but kept only this one because I had already opened it. Shawn does demonstrate quite well how each step should be performed, but the music is so VERY DIFFERENT than what is actually used in dance clubs. There are other instructional dvds available by different instructors who do use the correct music, which makes applying what you're learning far easier to actually make use of"
2,A Quick Start Guide to Line Dancing (Shawn Trautman's Learn to Dance,Product OK. Dance steps not explained and music not very good. I would hesitate to recommend.
1,No really good dances. Poor quality.,"Poor quality. Limited talent of the instructor. Way overpriced for what it is. Very disappointed. Expected better for the price. Paid extra shipping to get it here quick, just to find it a total disappointment. Sorry, but I have to be honest."
5,Exactly what I needed! Great for beginners.,"I bought the Quick Start Guide to Line Dancing based on the other reviewers comments and it was perfect for me. Great pace for beginners, presented in a logical manner, and highly recommended if you're new to line dancing. I can't imagine trying to jump right in and pick dances up without knowing what I now know. Great job!"
5,SHAWN TRAUTMAN IS THE BEST!,"I was inspired to learn line dancing when I saw all my relatives doing it at my nephew's wedding reception. I wanted be up there with them. I got Shawn Trautman's Line Dancing 101 DVD and now I'm ready! He makes it so easy to learn. He takes you step by step, just at the right tempo. He shows the steps from different angles so you don't have to guess if you're doing it right. He took me easily from from one dance to another and I got a great workout. I'm 64 years old, and I only wish I had found Shawn Trautman earlier."
4,101 for Jr H Dance,"I purchased Line Dance 101 to be used at a Junior High School Dance. Some students tend to be shy at dances, so, we thought line dancing would be a great way for them to get out there. It worked great! This was easy for the students to follow and they were dancing in no time. I would recomend this CD for anyone wanting to learn line dancing."
4,Trautman's Line Dance 101,"Only just started watching it, but he goes through the steps slowly and precisely. Allows lots of practice time. Considering the immense number of possible dances, though, the instruction should include more dances for the money. All-in-all, not bad."
5,Line Dance Instruction,"I haven't worked my way through the complete DVD, but I have been learning the first three dances. Shawn Trautman gives clear, easy instructions and goes over the moves slowly, then faster as you learn them. If you want to learn line dances, this is a great DVD to start with."
1,LINE DANCE 101 by Shawn Trautman,"Beware when playing this DVD. It will disable your DVD player and force you to watch and listen to the intro and COMMERCIALS every time you start the disc. You are unable to skip, fast forward, or go diectly to the menu and select the dance you want to practice. As far as the dance instructions, I think they are pretty good."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"I was hoping that this would be a complete Hollandaise mix but it requires melting a half-stick of butter, like most other mixes. I used to get a product (brand name Astor, I think) which was a very convenient ""just add water"" product and was delicious but I can't find it anymore.This product is OK but no better than Knorr, McCormick, etc."
5,cutesy,these little feets were very adorable..all my friends love them on the cupcakes..had tons of request for future baby showers..will definitely buy again.
5,Fantastic strings!,"I love the G string from Evah Pirazzi. I like having a mellower sound, and this string gives it exactly the sound I want. I currently have one of these on my acoustic violin, and am about to order one for my electric. I can't wait!!"
1,Doesn't work,Tried this stuff to keep squirrels from ripping apart my porch. Didn't work at all. Three repairs to wood damage and three times now they have disregarded this stuff and gnawed a hole to get into porch roof. I accidentally left the bottle out one day and they chewed a hole into the bottle to get to the stuff! Waste of money for repelling squirrels.
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! REAL REVIEW,we had 1 or 2 rats the beginning of winter now thanks to this product we have a whole family of rats... this thing attracted the rats to my attic.. complete waste or money... NOW IM FORCE to do the $2 rat traps with springs I wanted to be nice but at this point there not letting me go to sleep... AGAIN I DONT CARE WHAT ANY OTHER REVIEW SAYS THIS CRAP DONT WORK!
5,Gets oil in the KUBOTA,This is a necessary item for neatly adding oil to the little KUBOTA 3 cyl. engine. It's large opening is easy to pour into; and the offset spout gets to the engine filler opening. Need one in KUBOTA orange.
1,Retired Band Director,"Please don't do this to your child. Refer to your child's band director's preferred instrument list. This thing will be in the shop more than it will be in your child's hands, I guarantee."
4,A very enjoyable book,"This was a good read. I had one plot twist figured out pretty early, but the final twist was a total surprise. Usually Agatha Christie is the only one who can do that to me."
3,Works okay - but....,"Just be aware that it does NOT come with a connector on the ribbon cable. You will need to remove the connector from an old keyboard cable and clamp it on to the ribbon cable of this keyboard in order to plug it into the motherboard. It is not easy to do this without breaking the snaps on the connector so I would not try it unless you want to test your skills, patience and luck."
5,Inspiron Keyboard,"Heck! I got this replacement keyboard, a Dell branded product at a total delivered charge that was 1/3 less than Dell's price. Also, Dell had been delaying shipment for over a month and a half. I got this in only a few days. Over a month and there are no problems."
5,Perfect for Dell Inspiron 6000,fits perfectly for inspiron 6000 was designed for it. I don't think it will work well with other dell laptops.
4,Worked for me,"This keyboard is working perfectly with my Dell Inspiron 9300.Found a video on YouTube that showed steps to replace the keyboard on this model. I tried to find it again but could only find this similar one:[...]The whole operation was pretty smooth. No issue with the connector like other reviewers had.Putting 4 stars just because I can't honestly say ""I love it"" for a keyboard.Wishing everybody the same outcome with their keyboards!"
1,does not fit 9300,"1. the ribbon cable on the keyboard looks to the side of it, whereas in my inspiron 9300 the connector is at the bottom of the keyboard. Had to twist the cable a little to get it to the connector slot.2. the keyboard didn't quite close down after doing this, because the ribbon cable wouldn't fold3. It didn't work, anyway...probably a defective unit.on the native keyboard the ribbon cable goes straight down, directly to the connector slot."
3,Doesn't feel as natural as my previous keyboard...,"This was a good replacement keyboard. It fit my Dell Inspiron 9300 just fine. I do have an issue with it: it doesn't have the same feel as my previous keyboard. The keys aren't as ""chicketly"" as before.For those having issues with the ribbon cable not being on the right spot, contact your seller and ask specifically where the ribbon cage is - also ensure that, if the keyboard doesn't work, it is returnable.If you need help figuring out how to install the keyboard, I used these two resources:[...]"
1,some of the keys don't work,no instructions and most keys don't work.seemed to be used also. some stains on the keys. i will be returning right away.
1,Useless,This software is a mess! By the third lesson you are asked to fill in missing words of a sentence but have been taught no vocabulary. Avoid this product unless you already have a basic concept of the language.
1,Total Waste of Money,"I wish I would have read the reviews on this product before purchasing it. I would have saved my money. These ""instant immersion"" CDs have you attempting to respond to conversations and place words in correct grammatical order without ever giving you the translation. You don't even find out where the glossary/dictionary is kept until you are well into the first hour of lessons.Worst of all, there are glitches in the software that cause it to create nonsense words. This is especially evident in the dictionary and the crossword puzzle.What good is language learning software that creates nonsense words, I ask you? Honestly, this program is worthless."
1,terrible,"Stay away from this product. Besides the software setup being very confusing, the lessons themselves don't seem to be organized properly. A good language software should build the next lesson based on the previous knowledge. However, this one didn't seem like that, it would throw new grammar, vocabulary without ever introducing it before; I found this very confusing, had to click on the dictionary button constantly to figure out the exercise. Because I had some background in Italian before, I was OK for the first few lessons, then I was completely lost. I can't imagine anyone with zero background learning anything from this software. Unless you are trying brush up on what you once knew, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Stupid!,The first 3 cds are audio only and there is no book to go with it.... The computer part (tell me more) starts off with hard vocabulary and it's terribly confusing unless you already know italien.... HORRIBLE---don't waste your money!
1,Beware of the 5-star review,"The only review that is not 1-star was written by someone who also wrote 5-star reviews for 5 other ""Total Immersion"" programs. Kinda makes you wonder if he/she works for the company that produced the program."
1,"Worthless, a complete waste of money","I completely agree with the other reviewers.Here is an example of an exercise in this software:Here is a screen with a bunch of Italian words that we've never explained to you and you can't look up anywhere in this software, now associate them.Um, how about if you explain those words first?Also, in the few places that there are translations, they're not even conjugated. For example, if it shows ""he is"" on the screen, the tool tip translation is ""to be"", not ""he is"". How is that helpful for a beginner?The software itself is also written very poorly and clearly has not been updated in years. If it took the developer more than a week to write it, I'd be amazed. The help doesn't even have an index or search capabilities.Total garbage!"
1,So Disappointed,"I was really excited to get started in my quest for a second language, but this software really put a damper on that. I thought I was missing something, that there HAD to be more translations somewhere, but after reading all of these reviews, I see that most people are having the same problems. I know ZERO Italian, and it's obvious that this program assumes that is not the case. It seems to me that it is assumed you are quite fluent in the language and are only trying to brush it up a little bit. On top of that the software is really hard to get through. I'm sure eventually that part would get easier, but I'm not going to put any more time into this one."
5,Great item,Great Item! If you are looking for a software that can help you learn new languages. This is it! Awes
5,Great knife,I bought this as a gift for my wife. I could not have done better. It is now her favourite knife in the kitchen. It is a beautiful looking blade. The weight and balance are perfect.
5,Excellent Knife,I love my Shun knife. A little expensive but definitely worth it. Make sure you save the box that it comes with because you can use it to mail your knife to the manufacturer for your free sharpening. Life time guarantee!
5,The best and beautiful to look at too.,"I researched santoku knives before I bought this one. I have a Wusthof Santoku with the dimples in the blade that is supposed keep items you're slicing from sticking to the blade, it doesn't. The Wusthof is light and just didn't perform like I expected it too. I checked a professional chef's site that rated Santoku knives from 1 to 10 and #1 was Shun. Wusthof and Henckels tied at number 7. The Wall Street Journal also recommended Shun highly. In fact, everything I read about Shun was positive. When I received my Shun, I liked the heft and the handle immediately, it is extremely sharp right out of the box. It slices cleanly, no problems with thin skinned or stringy fruits or veggies. Working with this knife doesn't require the effort that the Wusthof knife does. The only downside to owning this Shun, is that you want to replace all your other knives with Shun."
4,"Good designs, but would like color plates....","A very good sourcebook for Turkish (Iznik) Pottery motifs from the 1475-1660's. The designs are large and very clear, but they are only in B&W. This book is really good for people who want to learn about Turkish floral designs. There aren't very many geometric designs, or explanations about how's and why's (i.e. the book shows you the designs, but they don't explain why it's used or it's significance...though at the beginning of the book there is a short explanation...)This book is GREAT for ARTISTS! Though it doesn't tell you how to start your own design motif, there are so many examples, that it isn't hard to figure out! I thought this book was really helpful to me! (I am trying to design a pseudo-Turkish design for my own serving platter.)"
5,Another Excellent book by Dr. Youseff,This book is very easy to read. It has really helped me to understand that we need to focus on God's will in our lives instead of what we want all the time. Life is a lot more peaceful when we seek God's wil instead of our own and our problems really don't seem so big or impossible anymore. I would recommend this book to anyone struggling in their walk with Christ or anyone who wants be become more deeply connected and build a stronger relationship with the Lord.
5,Great All Year Long,"This is one of the best for the holidays.This CD puts me in the Christmas Spirit without pushing me into all the hype. Wrapping packages becomes reflective, fun and peaceful with Paul's music in the background. But I don't stash this CD away with all the other Christmas music. All year long I keep it close at hand for my favorite song: ""With Today In My Eyes."""
5,Genius,"JLB once again combines poetic description of his hero's bayou home (thunderheads over the gulf), accurate dialogue (some gentlemens to see you, suh) and black humour. Love it."
4,Great read.,"James Lee Burke never disappoints and this book was true to form. For followers of the Dave Robicheaux character, this book is set at a time when Alifair is just 7 years old and so takes the reader back to a point in his career when he has recently joined the New Iberia force. A good portion of the story is set in New Orleans with Dave working undercover and as always Burke's descriptive talent allows the reader to almost smell the city and be right in the action."
4,"Dave Robicheaux....an ""Every Man"" Type of Hero","I'm reading these in order and am completely hooked on the Robicheaux series and the character himself. Admittedly flawed, always willing to put himself in harm's way for others, doggedly determined, and fighting the good fights....what's not to like? Throw in Burke's writing style, which is simply great and characters added or revisiting from other novels - all with depth and ""realness"" to them, and you have a winning series and one of our great mystery/thriller writers."
4,"Obscure title, complex plot.","Interesting, uncommon characters, both good guys and bad guys. Very much New Orleans in flavor, this story holds your attention as much because of the unusual interactions between the characters as for the manipulations of the plot....which has a real surprise at the end, with almost no foreshadowing. A cut above most cop/detective stories in style and characterization, ""Flamingos"" is much closer to Grahame Green than Mickey Spillane...so choose accordingly. I intend to read much more of the work of James Burke."
5,Just love all his books so far - this was no exception!,The bitter sweet - the great imagery! PURE Burke!
3,A little too gritty for my tastes,"On the recommendation of a column in my local newspaper, I bought several in these in the series, a little too much in the language department for my tastes. Nevertheless, you certainly can picture it in your minds eye. So, although I purchased several, I only read about the first third in one. I did not throw them away, I passed them along. There are others authors out there for me."
4,One of Burke's fine Robicheaux's stories.,"Burke is one of the few mystery writers who writes literature. His work should be studied in classrooms to illustrate how a down and dirty complex mystery story can be told with style, depth and thoughtfulness. His use of the English language is superb and his ability to share his world goes beyond vision; there is smell, touch, and feel."
5,Lifting the Crime Novel to entirely another level,"James Lee Burke transports me to another place and time, like many good authors. But then he gets under my skin and challenges me to think more deeply than any author since Steinbeck (in my teens) about his characters and the way that America and American society influences and moulds their lives and thoughts and actions. Not content with that he pushes the envelope still further and engages with me about the human condition. His work has moved me before but never more so than here"
2,The Grass Really is Greener on the Other Side!,"Don't waste your carbs and calories on tumaro's low carb tortillas. I thought they were OK when I got them but they smelled a little weird to me. I figured it was diet food so how good could I expect it to be? The contents of the sandwich masked the bland taste. One day my husband helped me by grocery shopping and brought home ""Mission Low Carb Wheat"" wraps. I was steamed. I made this dip and wanted to bake low carb chips. I cut up the Tumaro's tortillas into triangles and also the Mission brand and baked them in the oven. Tumaro's was awful and Mission turned out to be so good that I can never go back to Tumaro's. My husband came out looking like a hero!"
5,Amazing low carb wrap!,"searching for a decent low carb wrap is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. there are tons of delicious 20-30 carb wraps out there.. little for the low carber. finding these was a gift! 4 net carbs for the veggie, 5 for the multigrain. for any diabetic or carb watcher these are the answer to our prayers! enjoy!"
2,Inconsistent taste and texture,"I've had low-carb tortillas before and I must say I was disappointed with how the Tumaro's Multi-grain tortillas taste. The texture is also dry and quickly hardens when you warm the tortilla making it feel like cardboard.If you're buying these as a bread substitute, be aware that they won't taste well with everything. If you use lots of vegetables and spices, they're alright. But if you try to make a simple cheese wrap it will taste awful."
4,Average slicing knife,"It's better than most, but I feel that Shun's quality went down over the years. This knife doesn't feel as sturdy as my old Shun for some reason. I've had this knife for over a year now. It became my ""beater"". It holds an edge, but dulls out quicker than my other knives. It also takes a lot of work to get it razor sharp."
4,"Welding Apron Review, (longer straps please)","I ordered the Leather Welding Apron with the 42"" Bib. As you can guess, my husband is a King Sized fellow. The 42"" bib is really nice in that it offers more coverage than the standard smaller sizes and he loved it. The only trouble is that the fastening straps are too short. They might work on a med-large to large frame, but on a man who wears a 2-3XLT shirt, the straps are about 6"" to short to even be useful.We got a good laugh out of it and being as we are handy people we can lengthen the straps without much trouble. We are keeping the apron and I will sew lengths of webbing to accommodate his frame.Overall, the quality is fine."
4,Good weld apron,"I am a new welder, just learning how to MIG weld. I looked around and found this apron and liked the reviews I read. I have used it 5-6 times and I like it. It is long and I am well-protected from weld spatter, grinding sparks, and dust. It was well-priced for a heavy leather item. Only slight hangup is I am pretty wide (40"" waist, 48"" chest) and the straps get tight around the waist. I'd like to see those about 1-2 inches longer, but it is not uncomfortable. I use this with Miller WeldX sleeves and a short sleeve shirt."
4,Great apron,"I ordered this apron for casting bullets because of the length, but it is so comfortable to wear that I will use it for woodworking also. The apron is made of a very soft leather the only problem is the straps are a bit short for me as I wear a 2x shirt, I can just get it fastened."
1,Disappointed,"Personally, I think this was a big mistake on WW's part. While I like the Akashic Brotherhood and many other things, to make such a big difference between (for example) the Western Technocracy and the Asian Zaibatsu is unnecessary. A great story could have been told with the Asian Technocracy trying to gain a foothold in the established land of tradition that is China and Japan, but instead that was all thrown away in light of ""Everything in Asia is cooler."" For the other games, it made sense, but for this one, it was baffling."
3,Mostly pleased...BUT,"I am a HUGE Melissa & Doug fan and have lots of their products but I am a bit disappointed with this item. The entire thing is a bit unstable - especially when any of the pulleys are used. Even if I hold the upper platforms while winding any of the pulleys, the entire upper portion of the tree-house wobbles about considerably (and nothing I can figure will resolve the problem - tightening base screws doesn't help!). Also, the dowel ends to insert the footbridge to the platform were not lined up, I had to force and make adjustments to make that happen. Finally, the staircase assembly simply DOES NOT line up with the second platform when it is pulled up. I am very handy, and again, no adjustments seem to be able to correct this.Great concept, but a few things just ""not quite right""."
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun! Try It!",You should try this game it is soooo fun!!! The adventures are awsome!When I play it I can't put the game down when i;m called for supper. That is how cool it is!!!!!!!
3,Typical textbook,"Used this for an Ashford university Grad coursetypical textbook, not a lot going for it, don't buy it unless you have to."
3,I bought this as part of a 2 disk set for about the same $,I rated this average because compilations as a general have 10 tracks and 2 or 3 usually are filler. This one is not much different. I bought this because the cuts are some of the more obscure hits I remember playing on the radio in the mid 80's. Look for the 2 CD set that contains Platinum #'s A28967 and A28968.
3,A so-so read,"These are ""Big Dumb Object"" stories. They read OK, but when you're done you feel like it was all pointless.The author is also very heavy-handed at getting all the characters orchestrated into the right positions, making suspension of disbelief very difficult at times."
2,Pain Patches,"Ive used other patches from amazon and love them , this one is too hot for my liking , almost painful."
3,"Good concept, hard to get right.","Ok, I played this game and got frustrated in the same day. But this game was purchased for my dad, so I don't have to deal with it much. It's hard to complete missions when the altitude alarm is going off 90 percent of the time and I think they give you limited bombs to get the ground targets in the first mission. Believe me, with this rating I'm being generous."
5,Chris Cunningham and Bjork are Amazing!!!,"How could 'All is Full of Love' get any better as a song??? Add a video that is SO amazing, it truly knocks you off your feet. Simply put, it is a work of art - and one of the best Bjork Videos she has made.I applaud the accomplishment of this video - and hope for more thrilling videos like this in the future.This DVD is a Bjork Must Own Item."
5,"Beautiful, brilliant","I speak of the song and the video accompying it, strictly becuase I have no DVD player to view it on (!). Bjork has the most savage voice, and her music videos that are made to coencide with them are truly magnificent - this makes no exception! The harmonys can bring tears to one's eyes, and the imagery is fantastic...so whether you own a DVD player or not, the material alone is superb!"
5,All you need is Björk !,"Normally I'm not the type of guy who bothers writing reviews. But in this case I simply have to. If you're wondering: Isn't 10$ too much for just one video-clip? I'll reply, it was the best money I ever spent! Chris Cunningham has turned an ""ordinary"" Björk-song into the best music-video ever made. If he doesn't get rewarded at the MTV-awards, I don't know who should. Even some of my friends who detests Björk, admits that it's art-work beyond anything, they've ever seen. (That's a recommandation!!) The only thing, that I'm not completely happy about is the sound. It's ""just"" normal stereo CD-audio (Linear PCM 48 kHz/16 bit). Surround sound or DTS would have sent me straight to Heaven...Volumen (Björk's greatest videos - that means all of them - except ""ALL is..."") should be mentioned shortly: Buy it!"
3,okay,This game needs at least 3 players and doesn't have any words on the cards so it's not a game to see how much you know. The pictures on the cards are fun.
2,Dubious,The title states that the Battle of Alamance was the first battle of the American Revolution. Serious modern scholarship has long since debunked this romantic and erroneous claim. The inclusion of this claim on your website is not only inappropriate but calls into question the validity and veracity of all content included by the author.
5,priscilla is a great songwriter,"Check out ""I Wore Black"" and ""So Long Ago"" for a couple of very well written songs from Priscilla. I left the CD in a friends car not long after I bought it, and he didn't want to give it back, so I bought another copy. Sometimes it's difficult to know whether a release from an independent artist is worth the money, but I'm sure if you like independent rock that with good songwriting and arrangements, you'll like this CD."
3,For Children Over 6 Years,I was disappointed with the graphics in this book. I don't think that it's suitable for small children as it's not very bright and not very sharp. I bought it for my 4 years old son's birthday and had to put it away for when he's older. The story seems OK and it should be more useful when he starts to read - then we can both read it together.
3,Intelligent Page-Turner with a Literary Twist,"Peter Lovesey's The Last Detective is the proverbial page-turner murder mystery, written with humor and surprises. Lovesey builds a case to elicit a confession by the first suspect, who stubbornly will not confess. The next obvious suspect's case takes the rest of the book to build. Detective Superintendent Peter Diamond is pulled off the case and almost murdered before he solves the crime. Personalities of Diamond and his reluctant sidekick, their boss, the suspects, the victim, the solicitor, and the murderer play off each other in humorous ways throughout. Of literary interest are two Jane Austen letters that figure into the plot."
3,Forced to write a mixed review even though,"I couldn't put the book down through 250 pages, thought the multiple-perspectives narration worked and in general thought it was a good detective novel. The problem unfortunately is that the solution is not up to the rest of the book . Sorry - but I won't say more so as not to spoil the book. A middling grade."
3,Pugster Christian Charm Bracelet,"Pugster Christian Charm Bracelet ( Cross Teacher Dangle Religious Beaded )I didn't get these on sale. Not worth full price. Cute, but oxidizes very quickly, and should not be worn by anybody who has nickel allergy."
3,"a good album on its own, but as a live album, it's just ok","The music on this album is pretty good, but I have to dock the album a star because it's a live album, yet it has a low-energy vibe. When compared to something like Maceo/Fred/Pee Wee on ""Life on Planet Groove"" or some of the other JB live recordings from the '80s or '90s, this album just feels... well, it kind of feels like they're acting (as in, like actors reciting lines) instead of jamming and improvising. One can barely hear the crowd, and so I'm not sure the musicians are gaining any energy from the crowd. I sure don't feel it. Also, I've heard Pee Wee do better versions of these songs on other albums, so I give the album a final rating of three stars."
3,Not thrilled with this one.,"I love Aveda products, but this one did not do justice for me. I have scalp problems such as dandruff, dry scalp and oily scalp. My scalp actually dried out and got flaky from this shampoo. I only use it now if I need to dry out my scalp. The scent is earthy, like many Avedas. I only wish I didn't have 2 bottles now and would have tried a smaller one first."
5,Takes the hassle out of looking at your digital pictures,Takes the hassle out of making and viewing digital picture albums. Sets up easily and works as advertised.
3,"Like ""Dear World"", some spots are perfect, but other spots..","...miss the mark. Though the music fan from MA(who sounds like a shill, because his review sounds a little too forced)praises it, the music is not always 100% Jerry Herman quality.When you listen to the otherwise bland overture, you feel you've made a mistake, but as soon as Debbie Gravitte starts singing ""Miss What's Her Name"", you realize that you may still be in for a good time. Other treats are Faith Prince singing a cute comic sang called ""Where In The World Is My Prince"" and the incomparable Karen Morrow taking command of ""No Other Music"".It's nice to see Jerry Herman's still got it. Whenever I think of what Broadway oughta be, I think of Jerry Herman. I'm getting goosebumps thinking that this COULD come to Broadway."
3,Poor quality,I am trying to learn german and I am finding this software almost impossible to remember anything at all.They just start you right off with long sentences and nothing basic for the beginner.Avoid this product I wish I had researched more into what would help me learn another language. I give this three stars for the cultural activities that were fun.
2,Tricked me,"Loved the book but it was in really poor shape, almost falling apart. Definitely not worth the price I paid."
5,"String players, check this CD out!","This Hoffmeister stuff is terrific! The violin & viola parts are well balanced, not that hard to play, highly melodic, and great fun! Also, the recording quality is excellent! Since I love viola, you get to hear alot of C string on the bottom of the activity since there isn't a cello to take on the bottom lines - cool! John Harshfield Lapeer, Michigan"
1,Battery No Good,Battery will not hold a charge. Pressing the built in battery indicator does not display any lights. Of course my daughter waited 2+ months to tell me this.
4,Great product,"Great product, easy to install on the laptop. Battery life without being on the charger was a very long time. Would recommend buying if you have a dell d400"
2,"Close, but not quite right","The hose seems pretty good quality but it didn't fit my car like it said. I had to cut it and even then it didn't fit right. I own a 1997 3000GT. The hose has some tough structure to it, which a good thing. It did seem a bit small on the inner diameter, but perhaps it is supposed to be. I'm using it, but I wish it would have fit better."
4,Classic Indy Adventure,This film has the classic Indy feel to it. It is an adventure comedy and it is full of fun adventures and one liners. While not as good as Oganga or Trenches of Hell this film is probably the most Indiana Jonesesque of all the Young Indy series. Fun for the family!
3,Exceptionaly exciting episode!,"This is a rarity! An episode of YIJC that is actually action packed and fun to watch!Many of the episodes of this show were lavishly produced period pieces, but severely lacking in that good ol' two-fisted adventure that Indiana Jones is known for. But this two-part eposode is one exception.The first part involves Indy helping a bunch of soldiers - lead by Paul Freeman who played Belloq in ""Raiders"" - blow up a train and in the second half Indy and his friend end up kidnapping a German commander and find themselves pursued by the entire German army.I think this show would have lasted longer if there were more slam-bang episodes like this one. A must for Indy fans!"
5,Alfvén and Järvi at their best,"Alfven's music is evocative of the Swedish landscape, and in particular the Stockholm archipelago, where he gained much of his inspiration. These highlights of the Mountain King are amongst the best bits. This is the first recording of the completed 5th Symphony, but I still prefer the spacious first movement - you can almost hear the sea. The real gem on this CD is the Elegy - a tender lament for the death of King Gustav Adolf II in 1632. This piece introduced me to the wealth of unjustly neglected Swedish music - check out Stenhammar and Atterberg as well. The Elegy gives me a spine tingle every time. [Geoff Bushell]"
2,A Disappointment,"I like the idea of a video game based on the movie ""The Thing"" by John Carpenter, and I was excited to see how they would play on the fear the players had toward eachother- ""Is he the Thing? Is She??"" As it turned out the game play was extremely slow moving, and at first the controls and interface were difficult master. The graphics are a bit dated, and if you walk close to wall, you may get a piece of the other room on screen. In addition, it really didn't follow the movie at all. It seemed closer to a sci fi shooter like Cold Fear or Extermination, rather than the mind games I assumed it would contain."
2,Frustrating,"I've only been playing this game two nights and I'm ready to just give up on it. All I do is run around and die. And when I complete an objective and get to the next part, I soon die again and have to start over at the last save point. I don't mind a challenge, but I at least like it to be fun and rewarding."
2,this game bites,"I'm gonna get right to the point with this one. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK! The plot is horrible, the gameplay is immensely dull and the graphics are 2nd rate at best. This game makes a mockery of th John Carpenter classic. You will be ready to hurl your controller through the TV after you try to kill a larger alien with fire (which is the ONLY way to kill them) and run out of fuel and die a horrible grisly demise or light a fuel barrl on fire and die a horrible grisly demise 100... times in a row. Just don't even bother with this pathetic excuse for a game."
5,Awesome and Recomended!,"This game is awesome and recomended so do yourself a favor and buy it all-ready. If you don't I will be mad, because you will eventually be mad to."
4,Fun move-based game,"I bought this game for my boyfriend for our anniversary and he loves it. He says it is extremely fun, but that the graphics are really dark so it's hard to see the screen when you have the lights on."
4,The Thing for ps2,"The game is hard, but it is good. It is different in that it doesn't keep a scoreor points. The goal is to get through the levels. The other different thing about the game is that it allows you to have other characters come along with you on the missions. Thay can help you and you can help them, so it gives you the feeling of teamwork as opposed to going it alone."
4,simply put wow....,THIS IS A GREAT GAME. this game has alot going for it. only thing is the ending doesnt really make alot of sense i wont go into it though cause i might ruin someones day but everything else is superp. the trust factor and the difficulty is perfect. its cool how if you neglect your allies theyll go crazy and might shoot you and then themselves as well. the graphics are good to. the funny thing is that after you beat the game you want to watch the movie which explains somewhat about the ending and other things like that so its pretty cool. has any one heard of a sequel?
2,i just didn't feel it,i don't have a lot to say except that the game is frustrating and dark.i know this is not helpful but i just wanted to express myself.
1,Bad game based on one of the best horror movies ever -,"An absolute joke of a game, with many unintentionally hilarious moments. There are quite a few bugs and errors, and the whole game seems unpolished and unprofessional.Why they bothered tying it into the movie is beyond me, they just didn't make good use of the license. Most of the time you are running around in the snow or some featureless hallway with not much clue of what you are doing.Save points are spaced ridiculously, some are too close together, some too far apart.Trust system works....not at all. All your companions ""turn"" so there's seriously no point to it. As for story and character developement...forget it!A special mention about the bosses in the game because they are stupid. Last boss is easiest of all and the second boss you can just run past to the next level.Badly designed in all areas, boring, and directionless, with characters you don't care one whit about. A total disappointment."
1,Piece of crap,when i bought this i thought it was gonna be really fun cause the case looked cool but its a piece of crap dont buy this you will regret it
3,hard game short ending,funny battle.one AI team mate dead on the ground with his head blow offAI team mate two running a round on fire30 + small thing running a round2 big thing running a roundme dead on the ground from crossfire from AI team mate two shotgun
1,This game Bllows,This game is real relistic not actualy im just saying that so youll buy this game blows
5,Nice!,Love this movie; has great meaning. I've wanted this one for a while. Makes me cry every time. I'll show it to my grandchildren.
1,"Lots of promise, impenetrable prose","I was very excited about this book. Unfortunately it reads as though it were written by a graduate student has gone mad on speed. The simplest ideas are obfuscated by hideous prose. Here's an example: ""In order to maintain imposture as a notion, we must also maintain a ficiton of seamless subjectivity."" Otherwise stated: In order to act you have to pretend convincingly. Try it yourself, each page is packed with enough tangled syntax, overwrought diction, and unnecessary allusions to give a decent editor nightmares. Who is in charge of those grants, anyway? This is smart??!!"
4,Left me wanting more.,"This was a good A&E video biography. Hayley still is appealing at 55. I am only 24 and I find her absolutley stunning. Of course I would like to have met her when she was my age, alas it was not meant to be.This video is a straight-up biography about Hayley from her childhood to around age 55. Her father and sister contribute to the story and it doesn't shy away from some of the more controversial parts of Hayley's life. At the same time it tells a story with dignity and class. Anyone interested in in a biography about Hayley who doesn't want to read a book of memoirs will appreciate this video."
3,It's......... OK I guess,"Well theres not a whole lot to say about this CD. Most of the songs sound the same, with the exception of about two. They are all a little faster than I and most people are used to hearing. Their first song in my opinion is the best bacasue this is the song with the most feeling put into it. It you like bands like Metallica, Korn, Limp Bizkit, or Slipknot..... STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD! This is more of a punk-acid rock type CD. If you want to have a party just whip out this CD and have a one-man mosh pit!!! Great CD for people looking for a good band to follow."
3,Don't expect so much,"The user manual is the same of GMR885, I think it is the same technology but with different color, you do not expect more.I only got about .6 miles between my home and my job because there are some trees, the buildings are made of concrete, but with Motorola T5950 I got more or less the same performance, I think a litlle better with Motorola.One of the radios was defective, but I returned to Amazon and they sent me a new pair in three days. This review was made with the new ones."
3,Bad control response.......,"All characters possess moves that are pretty interesting and it makes you go ""oh coool!"" . Let me think what else I like.....hmmm....well that's about it. Just the moves are good. The graphics are alright...could've been better. The music....errr...let's just say I had to turn the volume down a bit when I played it. But what pissed me off about this game is the controls. They respond way too late."
1,Do not buy this item!,"I ordered this item to get the Ring Detector and it is NOT included. They shipped replacements and the ring detector still was not included, although it is clearly in the picture!Flipper/ring detector kit (accessories, hl10)"
1,A big rip-off,"Although the music is first rate, the film is missing frames and the sound is often out of sync. Also, two titles listed in the table of contents both on the box and on the disk menu are not on the disk!!... SALT PEANUTS and BE BAB A LEE'BA are missing!! Furthermore, Charlie Parker, after receiving top billing on the DVD is only in one number, HOT HOUSE!! Finally, to make matters worse one number not listed anywhere on the jacket or disk is a performance not of Diz or Bird but of two obscure dancers!?!?Granted the missing numbers can be found on many Lps, tapes, Cds and DVDs,but this DVD is a rip-off!!!! $17.00 and misleading in terms of content? The companies compiling, packaging, distributing, and finally selling this product should be ashamed of themselves!Jazz fans be warned. Do not buy this product! There are better ones out there, not to mention ones honestly advertised.Signed, Disappointed and angry in PA"
3,nice,She has a very beautiful voice the songs are just not strong enough. I found 3 songs that I find myself listening to over and over. She dose have a great voice but the songs just don't show that off.
1,Nobody home at this company,"Voice is ok. But control tags to insert pauses in text don't work, even when you follow the documentation's simple recommendations. Nobody at the company is monitoring or responding to their website support email. Not hooked on Fonix here."
1,Very Disapointing,"This program is very frustrating and support is even worse. First of all it's huge. It takes around a gigabite of hard drive space to install. The program opens with the default voice (Mike) who sounds robot like and choppy. When trying to choose an optional voice, the program crashes every time. Then it will not open again till I reboot my computer. The manual is one 8 x10 sheet of paper. My Tech Support emails have been completely ignored, and no human phone contact is possible. The troubleshooting website was just as useless. There are better choices.I have tried a few demo downloads from other Text to Voice programs that all worked very well. I'm sorry I didn't choose one of them vs iSpeak."
4,I Thought.,"It's one of those cd's you have to listen to over & over again before you can begin to really like it, i honestly thought it would be alittel bit more heavier it's more pop / alternative then i wanted it to be. I was hoping it would cacth more of the music that the character veronica mars likes but they don't play alot of numetal on the tv show. Otherwise i tip my hat off to Rob Thomas the shows creator who also helped produce the soundtrack it is really good! i highly recommend this cd to anyone who is a veronica mars fan."
5,Great soundtrack for life,"A great soundtrack compilation that is enjoyable even if you don't know the show. It's like a soundtrack to many of your life's moments - angry with the world, sad but happy, really sad or downright rambunctious.Almost all of the songs are great, but there are some stand out gems:We Used to Be Friends by the Dandy WarholsI Know I Know I Know by Tegan and SaraNo Sleep Tonight by the Faders"
5,Terrific music from a terrific show,From a great show comes great music. Being a fan of the show is not a prerequisite to owning and enjoying this album.
1,What just happened?,"This isn't even a movie as I understand them. Do not waste your time or money....take a walk instead. The cover has nothing to do with the movie, story (if there is one)or genre. Pitiful! The producers of this trash should be Left Behind after Armageddon."
1,Worst movie ever Period.,"I rented this movie from a local movie store and laughed at the warnings about how bad it was. This might be the worst movie ever made! It is not funny, not scary, and is filled with terrible acting and effects. Do not waste your money or any portion of your life on this movie. If you are looking for a funny zombie movie I'd recommend Shaun of the dead or Return of the living dead."
1,Heed The Warning At The Beginning Of The Film,"I like zombie movies. Some would say I'm obsessed with them (and they'd be right). I've seen some good zombie movies and, even more, bad ones. I downloaded this flick to my TiVo box and then I started watching it. It starts with a warning that no one should watch it and then has another warning, and still another warning (in the form of newscast) about just how bad it is. This film is the worst piece of excrement, human or otherwise, that I have ever seen. I only made it through about half of it and decided enough is enough. As they say, the only two things going for it are that it isn't any longer than it is and it doesn't have Ashton Kucher in it."
1,sent 'em back,"Great product, have owned several pairs. Be aware that all are EU sizes, but no width options from this vendor (or any other online it seems). Poor buying and product line sourcing by vendor."
1,LOL,"This is hilarious. These guys are making simple, uneffective music while dressing up like 10 year olds on halloween, WAY TO GO. This is stupid and anybody who likes it is probably just as stupid."
5,Cradle Of Filth may be the next big british metal act!!!,"I am so glad Cradle Of Filth releashed this cd as I think of it as a best of cd!!! It has two cd and the first one is a format of the best songs that they have made yet while the other cd is a besst of cover songs!!! The best song on the first cd is Her Ghost In The Fog and the best song on the other cd is Hell Awaits or Hallowed Be Thy Name!!! The first cd is called Lovecraft and the second is called Witch Hearts!!! The songs and sounds of this great band isn't the only good thing but, the booklet has a biography and pictures!!! The reason why rockers!!! need to get this because, Cradle Of Filth are creative and good at what they do. They have an opera singer which is very good and they are a mix between Goth and Metal!!! If had to say who they sound like it's Meat Loaf meets Goth!!! Get this all of you creatures of the night and you will begin to love vampires more than ever!!!"
3,Somewhat of a spoiler...,"I really like Cradle of Filth, and I wanted to own each and every one of their albums. But albums like this kind of push me away from doing so because they contain various songs from many other CD's that make the innovative factor of those CD's go way down. It's a good album soundwise, but it totally gives too much away that prevents me from entirely wanting to own CD's like Cruelty and the Beast. I bought Midian, but I was disappointed when I found that the majority of songs on that CD were already on this one which I had come to own first. I wish that the group would stick with the innovative album strategy instead of compiling mixes like this one."
4,Awesome album.,Has a good variety of new and old material. You get a lot of music. It has a lot of the songs I like on it. I feel overall it is a good album for any cradle of filth fan.
5,Definetly worth the price!,"First off I will set aside the whole black metal thing. COF and Dimmu Borgir are not true Black Metal. They are great but not true black metal. But with them it doesn't matter. This cd is packed with the greatest songs, covers, and unreleased tracks ever by them. My favorite songs on the first cd are ""Dusk andHer Embrace"" and ""Cradle to enslave"". On ""Dusk and Her Embrace"" the singer is practically scatting for 5 minutes straight. I'm pretty sure that he is intending it to not be audible, but it doesnt matter because it sounds great anyway. ""Cradle to Enslave mixes the keyboards with the usual shreaking vocals. On the second cd 13th track they do a great cover of a Sisters of Mercy song. Overall this is probably the best cd they have ever put out."
4,Pretty cool chair,"I purchased this stool to go with a craft/drafting table that I had purchased for my craft room. My other chair wasn't high enough and I needed something adjustable and quality because I spend a lot of time there. I was impressed at how solid the parts were when I was unpacking. Each part is well built and well made. Even the plastic bottom that the casters go in is a heavy duty plastic. I was able to put it together in about 15 minutes which is amazing for me because I always struggle with assembling items. Just be careful when you purchase and make sure you are buying the right height. Unfortunately, it is just a little higher than I wanted."
4,Great Flag,Very nice German Flag. I thought it would be bigger but I am still very pleased and I bought it for a great price. I love it and I'm gonna hang it in my room.
4,Perfect fit,"This is a pretty awesome replacemnt dash. The finish matches the dash exactly and I really like the untextured look as opposed to the stock textured look. Installation was easyMy only gripe is the front pocket could of been designed a little better. Its totally functional but some sorta material like rubber when a been a nice way to line the inside. Not a big deal though.Also, there are two holes in the back of the pocket, which for me I made use of by running my aux cable through it to hide itIt scratches pretty easy so ya need to be a little carefulSomeone said in their review that their stereo fit kinda loosley... well, mine doesnt. Infact it's sits perfectly.Also, not related to the product.. but taking out the hazard light and clock off the stock stereo dash... ITS A TOTAL PITA! But when you do get it out, it will drop in the new dash with no problem."
3,Just OK,"Although the fit and look of this kit is acceptable, the two plastic stabilizing pieces did not fit over the stereo sleeve, which left the head unit wobbly. Duct tape fixed that problem though. Better stabilization would have been nice."
3,Does the job,"Installed this in my 2005 Tacoma Double Cab 4x4 a few days ago.PROS:-Fits perfectly with my JVC In-Dash CD Receiver with BT and USB.CONS:-The silver color and texture is not like the stock piece that came with your truck. It doesn't look bad, but it is smooth and not the exact silver.-There is no metal bracket like the stock radio uses. There is a molded plastic bracket that seems flimsy, but hopefully it will hold.BTW - I found this youtube installation video very helpful.[...]"
3,"Worked, but it's not pretty","I installed this unit in my 06 Tacoma with a JVC-R900 deck. The deck and the stock hazard lights/clock unit fit in perfectly fine (although that unit is a pain in the rear trying to get out of the stock mount). The mount does not have the factory dimpled finish to it, but the color matches pretty well. The only real issue that I have is that there's nothing to secure the mount on the top, only the four factory 10mm bolts on the bottom. This is the same for the factory radio, but this unit does not fit as well. The top portion moves around a bit and can be pulled down very easily. It doesn't fit flush were the stock unit sat, there's small gaps and the edges stick out a bit.For the price it's not bad, but it's not good either. Wish I would have gotten a different one to be honest."
2,Unfortunate lower border for radio,"I purchased this kit and I liked it right up until I slid my new Pioneer DEH-4300UB radio into it. It was then that I discovered that pushing the buttons on the lower portion of the radio was challenging due to the border between the radio slot and the pocket. If this border didn't protrude all the way out to be flush with the dash, but instead was flush with the radio face, then this wouldn't be an issue.Google Tacoma radio installations and you will see what I'm talking about. If your radio doesn't have lower buttons then this kit is probably fine.I returned this kit and purchased the double DIN version. I installed a universal pocket in the lower slot of the double-DIN and I'm happy with the result."
2,Expected more from Scosche,"The kit was ok; seems and looks cheaply built. Didn't get the ""Free"" kit that Crutchfield throws in when you purchase a stereo because reviews I read recommended Scosche. Expected a bit more from Scosche; the color is a shade or 2 off of the factory console color."
5,Very nicely designed product!,"I bought this Scosche installation kit to install a Pioneer head in my '08 Tacoma. The unit is constructed just as well as the factory piece it replaces and matches the color of the dash in my truck almost exactly. With this unit and the Scosche wiring harness adapter, I had my new radio installed in less than an hour and a half. The only slight improvement that they could make (in my opinion) would be to provide a piece of non slip material for the floor of the storage area beneath the radio, but I will use some of the material I bought to line the drawers of my rolling tool box. If you need installation instructions go to [...] and click the link on how to install. They have great step by step photo instructions."
5,Happy with purchase,"Received the product in a timely manner. Great product and customer service. Pacific Stereo is a great company, would do business with them again."
2,A Disapointment,"I'll make this short and sweet.The game [lacks], ITs nothing like i expected, the camera view and character movmeent are HORRIBLE, and the fighting is horribly repetetive [like my use of the term ""horrible""]. I turned it off after the third level. This game is a perfect example of a game i should have rented before i bought. Unfortunatly i did not take that advice on this game."
4,I love this game...,I have to give applause to the game's creators for bringing Bruce Lee into the power of my hands. I have not been able to put the controller down since I first picked it up. The graphics are great and the story is interesting. It is also a great game to replay becuase you continuously figure out new combinations for different moves. Check this game out! I'ts definitely a keeper!
3,Only For Hard Core Bruce Lee Fans...,"The graphics for this game are decent, but it often takes a long time to load and there is some freezing, which is almost unheard of for the X-Box. Many of Lee's trademark martial arts/jeet kune do moves such as the 6-inch punch and flying side kick are included in the gameplay, but semi-challenging missions much be completed before you are able to ""buy"" them. Basically, if your walls are covered in Lee's posters, get this game...otherwise rent it on the weekend and save your money."
1,The Worst Game of all time,"Sorry people! This game is a dud. The controls are unresponsive and the realistic gameplay is not even there. If u see Bruce Lee climb up steps in this game, u will see that no one would even try to climb steps that way. This game deserves a 0.1 out of five but the scale is 1 to 5. So I give this a 1 out of five only because i like fighting games. And trust me this is being generous."
1,BORING!!!!!!!,"i am a huge bruce lee fan and when i saw this game at a flea market i just had to have it. i bought the game hoping that it would be worth the $ i paid for it, but unfortunately i was wrong. the first couple of days that you play it are ok, cause you're like ""man i'm kicking everybodys butt!!!"" but after the 3rd or 4th level it gets boring. i mean really boring. all you do is run a little and you get ambushed by 3-6 guys at one time, which isnt all that bad because it isnt that hard to beat them, but the thing is that after you defeat 1 or 2 another 1 comes out of nowhere. the controls for this game stunk because you could only hit one person at a time, while you're getting your butt whopped. i'm telling you DON'T BUY THIS!!!!! if you really want to play it go out and rent it and you will see how bad it is."
3,Could have been better,"This game isn't all that bad. The graphics are perfect. The character looks just like bruce lee. The major and only problem with this game is the fighting. It's horrible. It makes Bruce look like an entry level fighter, not an dynamic martial arts master. His kicks and punches are not direct like they are in his movies. They should have put more work into this. I'll say if they would have put at least another year into this game I guarantee it would have been the bomb."
2,Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon,"Game play is annoying because you have to buy all of your fighting moves. Bruce Lee fans will enjoy the fact that they can play as the greatest martial artist ever, but the game itself is just okay. Borrow it or rent it first. You will save yourself the trouble of having to return an average game."
1,suckfest,"Despite the hype, this game was terrible. I took it back the same night I rented it. The game is a poorly constructed mockery of Bruce Lee; who is probably turning around in his grave. Rent it if you want a good laugh but God help you if you purchase it."
2,gliche galore,"I bought this game the day it was released. I am a big Bruce Lee fan, but this game is a huge disappointment. I have run into so many gliches that it ruins the game. In fact, I am 'playing' right now!!! The last villain of this particular fight scene just doesn't seem to want to come and face the real ""DRAGON"" (are you listening Mr. ""I have the nerve to call myself the dragon"" Silverhair?). He is just out of reach although I can see him. There are also a lot of times that you lag while moving that allows your enemies to get a quick strike against you. I honestly believe that this game was shipped before it was truly tested/finished, either that or I just have a bad copy. The ONLY positive thing I can say is that at least there are nunchukus on certain scenes so you can leave knots on people's heads. After I finish the game, I'll probably give it to my cousin, whom I already advised not to buy it...for free. So please excuse me while I try to coax this last enemy to come and play..."
3,"Playable, but room to improve","I purchased this game because I am a Bruce Lee fan. While playing this game, I find some features great, while others keeps me wanting for more. The fighting is okay, not impressive. There is not really good moves nothing too fancy. The sound and the cutscene are good and reminds you of old Bruce Lee movies. However, the game does not allow you to explore places to places. It leads you to a scene and you cannot walk or go where it does not allow you to. Have you ever played Power Rangers on SNES (Super Nintendo). This is somewhat like that game except the graphics are better and t here are more moves. Also, when you are ganged up sometimes, the controls are awkward because you have to switch target. Overall, this game is playable but still has room for improvement.Gameplay: 7.5Graphic:7.5Story: 9Replay: 7.0Sound: 8.5Overall: 7.9"
1,I had more fun when I dropped the soap in front of Bruno,"After playing this game I finally realized how utterly worthless life is. Although I used to be a high-level exec making 300 grand a year, after playing Bruce Lee's Balls I quit my job and am now making $5.75 per hour as a ""janitor"" at my local adult store. I can smell it now... and it smells just like this game."
4,its bruce!,"the reason i bought my xbox, bruce lee qotd is the best game i own! ive loved bruce lees movies for a long time and im glad ive got a game i can be him in. i mean ive seen video game characters who imatate him like: mortal kombats liu kang, dead or alives zack and so on. now lets start describing the game, the graphics are great! i mean sure its not halo, but who really gives a damn about halo? the characters are great, bruce lee is practicly bruce lee. his face his moves and the sounds he makes not to mention the muscles on his body are exactly like bruces. and the way he moves are great as well! the enviornments could have been better but who cares this game is a definate must own."
3,Not all that great,"The graphics on this game are something I would expect from my PS2, the ""Bruce Lee"" character doesn't even really look like Bruce Lee, it looks more like the skinny guy they got to double for him in Game of Death.The Gameplay is also not all that great. It is a cheesy fighting game where you get to run from one level to the next.I cannot suggest this game to anyone, but it also is not the worst game I have ever seen, and I wouldn't really laugh at anyone who did buy it."
3,Not quite the Legend.,"First off let me say I'm a huge Bruce Lee fan and like many others I have been anticipating this game since I first got my XBox. However, the end results are somewhat dissapointing. The graphics are okay but I dont feel they pushed the XBox to even close its potential. I witnesed some jaggies and a few instances of draw-in, which to me is unacceptable considering the graphics are just average. The control was a mixed bag. Sometimes they were responsive and other times they lacked. Often times i found myself taking damage because the button sequence did not register in time. The sound is the saving grace, with descent voice acting and cool signature Bruce Lee howls. The music and ambient sound also add to the overall feel of it all. Bottom line is that the game feels a little rushed which is hard to understand because it took so long to finally see the light of day. Rent it for a few days and see for yourself."
3,WILL THIS BE THE ONLY BRUCE LEE GAME?,"I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS GAME. BRUCE IS MY FAV MARTIAL ARTIST AND I WAS THINKING WHAT IF THEY NEVER MAKE ANOTHER BRUCE LEE VIDEO GAME? TO ME THIS IS GOING TO BE RARE WHEN IT COMES OUT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE HAS EVER BEEN A GAME MADE ON BRUCE LEE LIKE THIS. I SAID I DON'T THINK I WANT THIS GAME BUT I HAD TO RETHINK THIS. MAYBE THERE WILL BE A SEQUEL, MAYBE THERE WON'T. BUT ONE THINGS FOR SURE, IF YOU LIKE BRUCE AND WANT TO LIVE A PIECE OF HIS LIFE GET THIS GAME. YEAH, I'M EATING MY WORDS FROM MY LAST REVIEW BUT I'M GOING TO GET THIS GAME SO I CAN EXPERIENCE ""THE DRAGON'S FURY""."
2,It's alright,"I enjoyed all of the action fighting scenes. But there is almost no story line to this game. You couldent do anything else but beat people up. Also beating them was almost too easy at times. You can buy upgrades for yourself but it barly made any noticeable difference. If your realy realy loved final fight for snes, even though Bruce Lee isn't half as good as that game you might enjoy it. otherwise I just wouldent suggest it."
1,STUPIDEST GAME EVER MADE,"this game just bugs me. i've seen some of his movies there great but this games SUCKS! the story you don't learn until the 5th level. the dragon coins? big whoop. the whhaa sound he does every punch or kick. it gets very anyoning. get this you have to buy move! why not just have say expirence and learn with the right amount. once you are a black belt you still get beat by fat, weak, and slow guys. to sum it up, this games blows."
2,I couldn't get past the horrible gameplay,I rented this game just to check it out. I expected a poor story and ok fighting gameplay (in other words my expectations were not high). I was still very dissapointed. I can't really comment much on the story or on the game as a whole because after about 10 minutes of punching the A button (or was it the B) I couldn't take it any more and returned the game. The fighting gameplay is incredibly primitive. It's on par with something like Double Dragon from the 80's. Definitely do not buy this game without renting it first.
1,This game is terrible,"This game is bad as hell. If you like then thats fine but the Xbox should have improve it more with better graphics and the fighting styles. The fighting stlyes were pathetic and now they give this review almost 3 star, I wont give it 1 star and a half. This game is wasting my time."
2,"""There he is. Lets, get em""","This is just another bad attempt to try to capture the coolness of Bruce and bring out only the bad. If they couldnt get his face right they shouldve tried to capture the mood, wich is what new games often neglect for the sake of realism. It should have been a role playing game. There have been so many attempts to capture the mood of a good old Bruce movie that it wont probably ever be given the chance to do it the right way again.. I think they could've simulated the shadeing and lighting of the cameras in those times to make it more nastalgic. It just seemed like a typical shallow representation of Bruce Lee. I cant wait to see the day when video games cancapture worthwile personalities with out messing them up. It is still a fighting game though and still adictive so it isnt a waist and is cool at times. They did though do a good job at capturing the stupid personality of the cheesey bad guys along with thier bad acting you would see in a 70's movie."
1,Bad Everything,"This game has bad everything. Bad setup (aka you can beat bosses with your eyes closed.) Bad graphics. Bad Consistancy (With gameplay and graphics.) All of that together = a game that is not worth buying. I am very disapointing, thinking this would actually be good and it amuses me to think I once thought it would be good."
2,"great name, great idea,..poor execution","I almost bought this game, but instead rented it. One of the best decisions I've made! This game has horrible camera work (no control at all) and the button lay-out is also terrible. Maybe if it was made by a better company that has been making games for awhile it could have been better, but it would require better button layout and control and much better camera work!!"
2,Boring,"The sound and the cinematic story are the only part that kept me from giving this game a negative score. The gameplay is boring as can be, due to the repetetive nature of it all. sure you develop/buy new moves, allowing for more moves, but overall, the game is move from section to section and beat up the bad guys.Moral of the Story: This game is Boaring"
3,The Cutting Edge,"This book was written in 1985 and is more of the old romance style novel. Unfortunately that is not made clear and had I known, I would have gotten it from my local library rather than paying good money for a book written more than 25 years ago.I have really enjoyed Ms Hwoard's books of the past 10-15 years but she was still developing her style when Cutting Edge was written."
3,re-issue of an old paperback,"While I would have given the original paperback 4 stars, I feel pretty upset since I already have it, and thought I was buying a NEW release. Shame on me for not looking more closely, but shame on Linda Howard for not letting fans know this is a hard cover re-issue of an old paperback that cost about $5 back in the day. Most authors are up front about re-issues in their promotional material. It's in there, but right at the end. I missed it. Buy the old paperback and save yourself some money."
3,old re-release,"I started to read this and per the style, flipped to the copyright page: this is a re-release of a 1985 book, and while I find some of Howard's older titles okay, the weak heroine/improbably hard male main character grated."
2,It wasn't my favorite,"This one isn't nearly as good as some of LH's other works. Brett was rather boorish, rude and manipulative (The best part is when Tessa throws some lemonade at him...believe me, you will cheer). Our heroine turns into a quivering lump of jelly when suspected of embezzlement. I'll give it 2 stars for the lemonade scene. Tess and Brett aren't even in the same ballpark as and Marlie, Faith and Gray etc. They are as poorly rendered and unlovable as that Greek jerk in ""All that Glitters."""
3,A reprint,"As others have mentioned, this is a reprint of a book that was originally issued as a paperback. While I enjoyed reading this book when it was a paperback book, it was not one of my favorites of Linda Howard's earlier publications and my paperback was a re-issue of the original.The story itself was classic early Linda Howard. Alpha male and feisty female. He has a hidden agenda and she's the innocent who gets caught in the middle.Even back then I would've given it a 3 as a paperback = enjoyed reading, but not keeping it to re-read. I donated my copy to the library years ago. If you're going to read an older Linda Howard book, I suggest Sarah's Child or longer novels After That Night or Dream Man.I would not pay hardback prices for this book."
1,re-release from 1985,"This book, originally released in 1985, is a waste of money. Ms. Howard should be ashamed to have inflicted this on her readers by writing in the first place and again by this misrepresentation as a new book."
1,Scammed,my wife is a long time Linda Howard fan and is livid with anger over being scammed into buying a 27 year old book. I'm happy since I feel this will save me money as she said Linda Howard! Never Again!!
1,Cutting Edge - re-release,"I don't know who is ultimately responsible for this grossly perpetrated hoax on Howard's reader but I do highly resent whoever thought her readers are so spacey as not to own, still have, or remember reading this book before - and to top it all off put a NEW release price on it. If this is a test then here's hoping it fails big time.Just a quick note...Howard has always been an auto-buy. Love her books & have reread most of them - some several times so usually remember if I've read her book before. Howard should be honest in trying to reach readers new to her writing but have respect for her older readers that do remember - AND above all be honest in pricing her reruns. This issuance is a slap in the face as far as I am concerned."
4,Love the Alpha male..a little frustrating though,"Frustrating is a good word for this book. Brett is a wonderful example of the alpha male, but Tessa taking him back after all that? Don't think so!"
1,I came this close,"Thanks to all you reviewers for the heads up. Shame on Linda and the publishers for this scam, glad I dodged it"
2,Weak early work of a great author,"This is an early (1985) Linda Howard and it shows! Her character development is really weak, the villain sticks out like a sore thumb, and the story is totally unbelievable (even for a romance). Of course, LH must have developed her ability to write a scorching bedroom scene early in her career. If anyone's really interested in LH, I would recommend Dream Man or Son of the Morning as two of her better works."
2,Not one of Ms. Howard's better efforts.,"I only recently discovered Linda Howard's books, and I've been making a concerted effort to read them all. For the most part, I've enjoyed them. However, the ""hero"" in this book was completely unbelievable. His last name, ""Rutland"" was certainly appropriate, since his solution to their conflict seemed to be ""let's have sex, then you'll feel better about all this."" I wanted the heroine to kick his insensitive, self-centered, Neanderthal butt out the door, but even though her love for him didn't seem to be based on much, it won out anyway. ""Kill and Tell"" was much better, as was ""A Woman of the West,"" where the hero was also rough and didn't communicate well with the heroine, but I felt he was better rounded."
1,Reissue,"Does this amount to false advertising? Since this book was initially published in 1985, in my opinion, it does. Several years ago Nora Roberts was faced with the same kind of advertising. The problem waw solved by putting NR on the uppper right hand corner of the dust jacket. It appears that this is a publishers decision since Amazon is advertising old Linda Howards books as new also."
2,disappointed,"This book is a release. It is not a new book from Linda Howard and is so old fashioned, I am surprised it was ever reprinted for today's modern audience. Do not buy it. It is cliche and you can figure out the crook very easily."
2,Didnt work,I brought this product in when I saw a professional hair dresser so she could make sure this was done right. It didnt work. It's like I never put anything in my hair..and my hair smelled bad for about a week
4,A MUST BUY FOR CURLY HAIR,"I Just used this product and I have to say I am quite satisfied with the outcome. I am a guy and had long curly coarse hair, it was totally unmanageable (even straightened!) I used this product once and it worked pretty well I can actually manage my hair and it is pretty straight . It wasn't that straight when I woke up today but I straightened it back down and it looks really good now. The instructions are a bit hard but I got through it quite well. The only complaint I have is that the step 1 lotion smells HORRIBLE but it was worth it. And defiantly worth the money"
4,Do not order from Sleek Hair,"The product itself is pretty good, it worked on my hair. However, hated the company sleek hair took forever to ship out my order. I ordered on 05/18/2010 and didnt get the product for more than 10 days !!!!"
1,dissatisfied,"At the base, I have curly hair and slightly ""Crépu"" in french.They are very smooth easily.I received the product very quickly.I knew how to handle, but I prefer to follow the letter leaflet in the box of the product.Despite having followed to the letter, my hair has not budged a bit: still curly, always the same volume.I am disappointed acr I bought quite expensive and therefore nothing.I sent an email to customer service and after sales service the day after use (about one and a half months) ... I am still awaiting a response.Produces very poor quality."
3,OK for what it is,"The 6 strings are braided together in packaging, so it's hard to pull out your upper E string without unpacking all the strings..."
2,great at the beginning but lots of chipping within 6 months,"I was ambivilant about this knife when I first got it- the grip is not very ergonomic or comfortable- but I fell in love with it because of its performance. Unfortunately, within 6 months of heavy household use (no dishwasher, no dropping on the floor, no cutting on anything but cutting boards) this knife developed several sizeable chips that have been very difficult to sharpen away. It has been relegated back to the chopping block for most potential applications in my kitchen."
3,Good knife,"I got this knife recently and I am satisfied so far.Based on the price and earlier reviews I was expecting much more from this knife, I was slightly disappointed.The knife itself is nice and sharp and serves my purpose, but is slightly lacking in sharpness when compared to other knives in the same price range.The build quality packing and presentation is excellent though."
5,Great Knife,"OK: it's expensive, good looking, very, very sharp. Oh, and it does what it was intended to do in the kitchen with perfection. Only wish I could afford more...many more."
4,awal's,"brody was very good ... defiantly not a typical con-job flick, surprisingly comedic & subtle -- RINKO KIKUCHI had few lines yet a salient role. do have to say couple creepy moments ""the train-lightening-scene"" ."
5,Interesting and New!,"The Brother's Bloom is the story of two brothers. Stephen, consumed with the idea of creating the perfect on and Bloom, dragged along into his meticulously thought out story lines embedded with symbolism. In one of their last cons before Bloom leaves the business for good, he ends of falling for the target, Penelope. This leads into a whirlwind of action where you're never really sure what's a con and what's real. Is Stephen still in charge of the con or have things taken an unexpected turn? With the help of Bang Bang an oriental pyromaniac they play the part in a con that will change their lives forever. This movie provides the perfect combination of whimsical comedy with a serious tone."
3,the price was outrageous,"I love the movie just not the price. the movie was impossible to find when i bought this [or so I thought]. About a week after it arrived I went to a Dollar General. I had been looking through the movies trying to find something new to watch when I found the Brother's Bloom. The Price of that copy was $4.50. I was really upset with this buy, but I can't complain a lot becuase this movie was almost worth it..."
3,JWVHIII,Not my cup of tea. The characters were too strange for me to develop any interest or empathy. The flashforward/flash-back technique was week and way overdone. There were several character developments that when introduced were never developed. Charate motivation was muddled so badly that the acting was off. But then I stray... The movie was never engrossing for the viewer. Those who directed this malfiesance know how they screwed up by now or are as self delsional as the charaters they guide on screen.
2,Could have been better,"See it if you love Rachel Weisz or any of the other actors, even though they don't do much when Rachel is around. She is perfect in this movie which is why its getting 2 stars instead of 1. The first hour is magical and funny...I laughed out loud several times during it...but ultimately it doesn't end the way it feels like it should and it turns from perky/fun/awkward into depressing/confusing really really quick. The entire last act ruins the film for me but if you liked IN BRUGES, then you might as well give this a shot..."
5,Great movie,"This is a fantastic movie and the Blu-ray looks great. It was a great buy, and I can't wait to watch it again."
3,Depressingly forgettable,"The Bottom Line:I love movies about con men and I loved Brick (director Johnson's first film) but I have to report that The Brothers Bloom (which I actually saw in theaters no less) is a bland, boring film enlivened only by Rinko Kikuchi's performance as Bang Bang; though the film is by no means terrible, it has so little to recommend it that I would easily rather watch an amusingly bad movie (like anything with Dolph Lundgren in it) than suffer through The Brothers Bloom again.2/4"
3,An example of not knowing how to end a movie.,"The movie is a crime-comedy. Would have been a fine movie IF it would have ended at the 1 hour 27 minute mark; instead we get several unrealistic plot twists that stretch the run time another 30 minutes or so. The plot twists in the end did nothing to make the movie better or more enjoyable. Man, I hate that. Still entertaining movie worth watching (once) despite the crap ending.As a substitute for this movie I recommend 2000's ""Nine Queens"" and/or 2004's ""Criminal"" which was remade from Nine Queens plot and keeping much of the script intact as well; the real difference however is that it is done in English and stars John C. Reilly, who I thought was good in the role & Diego Luna (a very good actor see: Y tu mamá también). Either one you pick, both are superior to ""The Brothers Bloom""."
1,BORING.,"I paid $10 to get this as Video On Demand and the only good thing is that we didn't have to drive to the Blockbuster or movie theater to discover that this movie SUCKS.Oh sure, you can see and hear that they tried to make it clever, witty.And got some top notch actors which is why it caught our (my wife's and my) interest.But it's just flat. Never engrossing. Yeah, I get the jokes, but they are just not funny enough to makeme laugh.Okay give it a while, it's gotta ""pick up"".... No? Went to the toilet, walked the dog. Still not over, oh well... turned it off well before finish."
1,One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen,"I saw this mess at AFI Dallas. Ridiculous plot -- it made no sense. Horrible acting. Even worse writing. I would have left after 20 minutes except that I was with a friend and sitting in the middle of a row. As the ending credits started to roll, we both bolted out of our seats. Quickly walking out the exit, we turned to each other and said at the same time ""That was awful!!!!"""
4,Slow start on a good read,"Ok, I like this book. It was a bit slow to start. Think of starting fire with two sticks and it took 120 pages to get fire. Once you sit through the set-up, it's a compelling read that cannot be put down. At a guess, I'd sat John Ringo has been hanging out with a scientist because there is a lot more science in this fiction than is usually the case with his works. I suppose that's the Taylor influence? Anyway, great read and kind of a unique variation on the replicating machine plot. Worth reading. Wait for the soft cover though."
3,OK not great,This book was not up to the standards that I usually expect from John Ringo. THe basic premise of the story showed promise but the characters where a little flat and the action predictable. This is a story that neededs a little more thought put in to it. I like John Ringo but this was not his best work
2,flat characters and swis cheese like plot,"The book seems to be an attempt to a high paced plot but where Bolo series succeeded this one failed. The characters are flat, the plot is not very well thought through and the ending ... well it seem to come to abrupt, so abrupt that I was looking for possible missing pages. Overall the ending is very much like any idea in the book, - incomplete"
2,Von Neumann's War,Ringo is best known for writing futuristic combat an area in which he excels. This book has little of his usual touch. It is burdened with huge amounts of scientific trivia. It interferes with the plot and makes the book only of interest to those to whom such trivia is of interest.
1,Not Good,"I've read and enjoyed several books by John Ringo over the years but Von Neumann's War is one that I will discard from my bookshelf immediately.This book was nearly unreadable to me because of the mishmash of styles between Ringo's hard-boiled MIL-SF and co-author Travis M. Taylor's highly technical and verbose style. What resulted was a story that felt very stiff and academic even as it was trying to be a fast-paced thriller.Overall, this book focuses far too much on the science and not enough on the fiction as it goes on and on about technical minutia but leaves the reader wanting more in terms of character and plot.I've found that Ringo is at his best when writing alone or collaborating with David Weber. However, his mixed collaborations with other writers such as Travis M. Taylor, in this case, or Julie Cocherane in the case of Cally's War have turned out some of his worst material."
4,Hard Science with a Clancy POV,"I very much enjoyed this effort and am looking forward to additional books from the Ringo/Taylor partnership.This is a kick-butt heroic action romp with some hard science mixed in to give it a ""Hey, that could happen"" vibe.R."
3,Why no EMP attempts?,"I thought the book as a fairly quick read as SciFi military thrillers go. The authors try to go into a good bit of detail about the science of what is happening. But the do leave out some of the more logical ways to try to defeat the enemy. For one I was shocked that they never tried to create a large EMP via a high atmo nuke or similar. Considering that the invaders are robotic in nature you would think that would have been one of the first things they tried.Also no attempts at all are made to communicate with the invaders. Not that it would have mattered much, but at least they should have made some attempts to establish first contact.As far as Von Neumann machine tales go I much perferred the story told in ""Spin""."
4,Diverting read,More science than most. This should not be a forgotten Ringo book as I enjoyed it. But is it just a pleasant afternoon diversion.
3,Too much blah blah,"Interesting concept - von Neumann's theory of interstellar colonization - and good action descriptions. But there's too much blah blah among the characters in-between. I actually fell asleep reading the book last night. One book can stand only so many cutesy scenes. I'm about 2/3 finished with the book. Often these days, I don't even finish books, but I will finish this one because some of Ringo's other stuff is excellent (maybe this one will turn around) and I want to see what the characters do to solve the problem."
5,A TRUE PROFESSIONALLY WRITTEN COVER LETTER BOOK,"A MUST READ COVER LETTER BOOK WHICH TRUELY EXEMPLIFIES WELL WRITTEN COVER LETTERS. PLEASE CHECK THIS ONE OUT LAST, SO THAT ONE CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE, FEEL THE DIFFERENCE AND TRUELY CONVINCED TO BUY THE DIFFERENCE. ONE WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED"
4,A decent story,I liked this book but it didn't quite live up to the expectations I had for it. I love Mercedes Lackey and don't think this was her best effort. It was a good read and an entertaining story though. I thought Skif's backstory was interesting.The over use of dialect was bothersome and had the unfortunate tendancy to pull me out of the story.
4,"Familiar Story with a bit of a ""Twist""","Oliver Twist, that is what this book reminds me of. However, it goes a bit beyond that. Being set in the distant past (Medievil times I believe), it tells the tale of a young orphan boy that winds up running away from his abusive uncle and cousin and being accepted into a ""Gang"" of thieves, headed by a 50 year old man with no legs. Here he is taught the art of theft in much the same way it was in Oliver Twist. When his new ""Family"" is killed he goes looking for revenge. A straight forward tale, very easy to follow (Although the charachter's ""Dialect"" is a bit difficult to read)."
5,In depth information about a character,"Although I cannot disagree with a previous reviewer's comments that this book doesn't further the general storyline of Valdemar, I appreciate the in-depth treatment of a single character. I also have to admit that I would like to see more books like this.Ms. Lackey manages to accomplish a very, very difficult task: to focus almost exclusively on one character's experiences and viewpoint, without turning the other characters into cardboard cutouts.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who had already read the ""Arrow's"" trilogy, but this is not a good book to introduce yourself to this world."
5,Second only to Exiles Honor of the Valdemar Books,"I really liked this book. As far as the Valdemar series's go, it is one of the better. Read it for yourself.Storyline:Starts out with him living with a small gang of miscreants & becomes the finding of a new kind of friend (his companion) and their acceptance and training into a special group of mages & other ""companions"" (white magical horses kinda like unicorns only without the horn or virgin stipulations)."
2,Definatly one of the worst,"Generally, I find Mercedes Lackey's novels to be slightly strained as far as the plot is concerned, but the characters and major events of the stories are always vivid and memorable. This book, however, annoyed me no end. The plot is, for lack of a better word, terrible. The characters and events are not believeable. Also, many of the rules and laws of Heralds so well-known by all faithful readers are rewritten, and in a rather unsettling manner.In short, I would not recommend this book to anyone. Not even a devoted Lackey fan. It's hardly worth it."
3,actually 3 and a half stars,"a fine read but most of the characters somewhat shallow. was disappointed to see that lackey couldn't keep her stories straight. in her previous books it hinted that skif's mother taught him how to pickpockets but in take a thief, his mother was killed at an early age before he started stealing. the book itself is an amusing read but judging from lackey's previous book, take a thief is substandard work. altho i must say it's a definite improvement over burning brightly."
2,Pretty Disappointing,"I dragged myself through the first few chapters wincing at the implied accents. Once the main character reached the Collegium I thought it would pick up, which it did, then began to lose momentum. I'll still wait for another Valdemar novel, but this one doesn't cut it."
4,Love sense humor with great adventure,Once again humor with adventure with great deal of learning to love a character leaves u wanting read more....what other things will skif get into...read arrows of ..set find out
3,"Good, but not Lackey's best","This story definately fills a gap in Skif's his history that I'd hoped Lackey would fill, but it isn't as good as her other books. While it definately expands Skif's character some, it doesn't go as far into his life as I'd have liked. When Skif was introduced in Arrows of the Queen, he was a character that grabbed my attention right off. I'd always wanted to learn more about his early years as a theif.This story takes the reader from Skif's childhood working in his uncle's tavern, through his years as a thief, his attempt at revenge, and--finally-- into his first years as a Herald.The ending was a bit abrupt, but overall was good. I'd only recommend to people who've read at least Arrows of the Queen, Arrows Flight, and Arrows Fall. If you haven't read those, this story won't hold your attention."
3,Take a Thief,"Interesting story, explains a lot about Skif. But, the overuse of dialect left me cold. Sounded like Cockney British. I half way expected ""The rain in Spain"" to pop up at some point.Also, part of the time Alberich talks like Yoda and part of the time not.Read this book but read The Arrows series first."
2,Not up to standards,"I was very disappointed with this one. If you bother to get through the thick accents that plague the first hundred pages, you might even manage to make it to page 300, where the real action of this 350page book begins. I usually really like her work, this was not typical.If you are a true fan, don't buy the hardcover, it will leave you feeling cheated."
2,Not enough about Skif,"In other Valdemar books, we learn that Skif can get in any room, remove any item from a person, and so forth. In this book, it seems that he isn't *that* good at pickpocketing on the street, even though he milks it in the Collegium. And then, it seems that he quits being a thief long before he becomes extremely talented at breaking and entering.I found this very inconsistent, and would have been more disappointed had I higher expectations."
1,Disappointing story painfully written,"I am a fan of the Valdemar books. Although they are not great literature, they are generally good stories. I looked forward to Skif's story, as I found him an interesting character, particularly when he was a Herald Trainee. This book was a huge disappointment. Alberich has started to speak like Yoda, the dialect was painful and painfully inconsistent. The plot was thin and predictable. I found myself putting the book down in disgust, or skipping pages that were just too awful. In the end, Skif is offered instant herald status for acting as a decoy. Hello? Lots of herald-trainees have done risky and noble deeds, and never a one went to instant Herald. The repeated references to Herald Myste were contrived and painful. I finished the book, but it was rather like a train wreck - it's horrible, you don't want to see it, but you can't help looking. Skip this one."
3,Not Oliver Twist,"While I saw a lot of reviews saying this was ""too Oliver Twist,"" I respectfully disagree. Oliver Twist is dreadfully depressing, with unlovable characters, whereas this book has hope and lovely characters. My issue is that it's fairly plodding and the formatting was distracting. Had the transitions between thought and prose been better handled, this would have been a four star book, for me."
3,Ac charger too heavy,I checked this piece in one of the local stores & everything seems nice but the ac charger was very big atleast twice the size of the unit itself which totally defeats its purpose of it being portable.I have not bought the unit but this is a real drawback.
1,VERY HAZARDOUS,This product literally BLEW-UP in my son's face. After charging it we took it down to grandparents house and set it down on the floor while he went to go change into swim gear. He came back to pick it up and it exploded! The blue nose part hit him square in the forehead and we saw lights and the blast was so loud! I am filing a incident report with US consumer products but hopefully I can stop someone else from buying this until that is settled.
1,Don't buy it!,"Don't waste your money,fun toy but it won't last long. Water will get into the circuit board and it will fail."
3,Fun for the summer....,"but that's about how long it will last you. I've gone through at least 3-4 of these and every time I get a little more life out of them. I've learned that the more care and attention you do to dry them out, etc, the longer they will last. If you don't do anything (i.e. turn them upright after use, open the top to dry out, etc) you'll be lucky to make them last a month or two. The longest I've had one was for two years. And that's probably a record. Though, the kids have a blast with them and are the hit of the neighborhood. I gave it a 3 only because the kids really enjoy them. If they weren't so fun, they would be a 1 or 2 because they have a short life."
1,This is a piece of junk!,"This toy worked one time. I contacted the seller and the company and neither would help me get a replacement. Company gave me some ideas of how to replair, but when I asked for a replacement, they were no longer in business. They should be reported to the BBB."
2,"nice, but . . .",the spring is WAY too stiff. Once you get the shower door shut (which takes a lot of effort) you can barely get it back open again. The spring needs to be more flexible.
2,Ebook sample pretty useless for this series,None of the eBook samples I've looked at for this series is virtully useless as they stop before they even get to the first chapter.
5,"Almay Toner, 2, for Dry Skin","Gentle, effective skin cleaner toner. Mild smell, no fumes, does not burn or leave skin dry. It's perfect."
3,none,I was dispointted about the purches. the shipping took long time even though i payed extra price
3,AUDIO NOT IN ENGLISH,The film is interesting to watch but its not in english so its not as easy to follow whats going on.
3,OK but NOT an SACD,"Mostly I wanted to warn that this is not an SACD as listed at the time I bought it (that may be corrected as you read this). It was a standard 16 bit CD. Amazon, of course, allowed me to return easily without any charges so no harm done!"
5,My all-time favorite album,"This is my most treasured album. These are vocalises transcribed for cello, and since vocalises went out of fashion a century ago, few people have heard them. Transcription to cello was a brilliant idea, and the pieces are heart-wrenchingly beautiful."
5,An excellent documentary,"This video is a must for those interested in spy movies. It shows you the REAL side of the spy industry, the not so glamorous side. From spy gadgets to secret orginizations to assasinations, it's all in there. A must for any video library."
2,Great pictures but signs are not ASL!,"Checked out this book for my 1 year old son and he loved the real pictures of kids and animals. However, I was disappointed because the signs are NOT American Sign Language signs. We ended up looking at the pictures in this book, while doing the ASL we already knew. I would recommend the baby sign books by Kim Votry and Curt Waller instead as they use real ASL."
4,This little book had enough material to help me get started,"I picked this book out of about 6 or 7 others on the same topic because the writer gave enough, not too much, information all at once but rather takes the reader step by step in the very basics of chess. The author points out that chess is a lifelong learning experience and gives some good advice on starting out giving pointers on some errors most often made by beginners. The book has been helpful to me I have not yet gotten out of the novice status but I intend to! The book points out the names of the pawns and the arrangement of them on the board in a very helpful manner. The author does not patronize the reader but rather shows an interest in getting the reader ready to move forward."
4,Sometimes an introduction is all you want,"An exhaustive study this book is not. But if you, like me, want to know how to play chess beyond merely knowing the rules of movement and aren't ready for a proper study of the topic, then you are not going to do much better than this book. Of it's 55 pages of actual text, none are wasted. Clearly written, concise, and brief. Clearly nobody is going to become a master after reading this, but I now feel I understand a game that mystified me."
1,Typos Galore or Typos-R-Us would have been a better title,"Throughout the reading it was annoying, but then came the games. At this time I have only went through the first game listed, but there were two typos in it. These are harder to figure out since it's not obvious which way to move your piece. I can only assume, based on the rest of the book, that the other games will also contain typos. The Editor of this book should seek another profession."
2,Could have been much better!,"I ordered this product in hope of a good program that would help me learn Japanese. I instead was found with a program that, instead of teaching, sent me more on my own to learn. Its a lot like going to a book shop and buying a Japanese dictionary.Though the program has a lot of information, it doesn't give a good guide to show you where to start. There wasn't even an instruction manual packaged with the software. I would recommend another product because I am very displeased with how this one is performing."
1,Horrible!,"This product is garbage... My mother is a native Japanese speaker, and I've taken two years of Japanese, so trust me and stay away from this product, as it does not address very important aspects of Japanese grammar which should be learned immediately upon an introduction to the language. Also, take note of all of JP26's (the aforementioned reviewer's) reviews...all of them are for Topics Entertainment products. I think that it would be safe to assume that JP26 is somewhat biased. :)"
1,Won't teach you Japanese--There is no instruction!,"If you buy this product expecting it to teach you Japanese, you'll be extremely disappointed. It is a bunch of drills and exercises, but with no curriculum. Without a curriculum, it's impossible for a beginner to go through the drills with a clue as to what's going on. It's like taking a Japanese test without being taught any Japanese beforehand. Some of the drills, like voice recognition to test your pronunciation, are worthless gimmicks.The software itself is also poorly documented and when you load it up, you'll be wondering what it is you're supposed to do. I'm not sure who the target audience for this software product is. If you don't know much Japanese, you won't be able to use it. If you already know what the software requires you to know before you use it, you probably will be advanced enough to not need it."
1,Terrible Software,"Probably one of the worst pieces of boxed software I've seen. I've been learning Japanese on my own for 6 months and would really like some software to help me drill and provide some structure. This is not it. No manual, the microphone works on one computer but not on another, you need to have the CD in the drive (no way to install completely to disk), voice recognition is terrible, etc. Spend money on something else."
1,waste of money,"I bought this title just last night in the hopes of finding good software to help me learn japanese. Within about 5 minutes of installing it, I was ready to return it. It comes with no book, so I had to guess what all the CDs were first of all. After I figured that out, the program itself was confusing to navigate. What I discovered were a lot of weak looking drills that were basically for testing what I already knew about the japanese language. Unfortunately, what I know is NOTHING--that's why I bought the software in the first place!! I'm assuming that the ""lesson"" portion of the program was to teach me, but seeing how nothing happened when I clicked it, that didn't really help... (XP issue?). Hopefully BestBuy will let me return it even though I opened it... I really want my money back. If you want to learn japanese, you're probably better off getting a book instead. It may be harder, but at least you'll learn more from that than this software."
1,No structure at all,"I came to this program with no experience with Japanese. For the longest time I thought I must be missing something. Where is step 1. Every section seems to require prior knowledge.I was able to muddle through it, but I felt like it was fighting me rather than trying to help me. I want to spend my brainpower learning how to speak Japanese, not trying to understand this program and its contents. It did make good use of the PC to help teach me how to say things. But most of the time I had no idea what I was saying.The interface was cute and clever, but helped to obscure the functionality of the program not make things clearer.In the end I just googled some lessons and found it much easier going. I think it was a waste of money."
5,Great Gift!,"The photography (extreme sports, with breathtaking scenery) is spectacular, and some of my favorite quotes to inspire, (and some I am savoring for the first time) are contained in this boxed calendar.Purchased as a gift for two exciting young women who are new managers, the calendar seems like a perfect way for them to keep their motivation through that first difficult year.Looks like a winner!"
3,"Good facts, poor editing - see page 221","The facts were presented in a no-nonsense fasion and were correct to the best of my knowledge. However, the spelling and over all grammatical editing was horrendous."
2,not working,i have ipod touch 1st generation and since i bought it 1year ago doesn't work anymore....it is not capable with the apps
3,Microphone for itouch 2G,It does everything it says it will do. I'm happy with the audio quality but there's no detent in the design of the plug to hold it in the itouch or ipod. it works well for recording but my $400.00 itouch looks pretty trashy with a rubber band around it holding the microphone in place.
5,It's a really good microphone,You may not know that your 1st generation Ipod Touch can make voice calls through Skype or other voip client by using this external mic and updating the iPod Touch firmware to 2.2. You can also use your iPod Touch as a voice recorder and not have to buy another device. I found that this mic work well for making Skype calls. You don't need any special software to make it works just plug it into the iPod touch and use whatever application for voice recording (I use Voxie) or voip client (I use Skype) it is that simple. I think this is a great buy to be able to give your 1st gen Ipod touch the extra feature of making voip calls and voice recorder.
5,Great Mystery,"I just recently finished reading ""Dangerous Research, by George""I highly advise others to read this book. It is very addicting, I could not put it down because I was so anxious to read the ending! Tell your friends about this book as well. Its one of the best books I've read in a very long time."
4,Great for the money,"This is a great little heater. I got it for my daughter's room a little over a month ago because Consumer Reports rated it highly. For $25 bucks, it does all I ask. What I like is that you can set it you heat 360 degrees or only push the heat to the front. I set it to the latter, because it's so compact a good place for it is on top of a dresser.Only thing I wish it had was a digital thermostatic control, but after a couple days of fiddling, you get just the right temperature and can leave it there, tweaking it if necessary."
1,Short-lived,Worked well the first year. Second year it overheated to the point that the plastic was soft and the knobs would burn you if you touched them. It annoys me that so much junk gets sold today. I would much rather have paid a higher price for a heater that was reliable year after year.
2,Melted Itself open,"I bought this heater last year and used it all winter very happily. It worked very well and kept my computer room comfy and warm.This year i brought it out to use, plugged it in for day use and on the second day it started turning off on me after about 3 min of use. I unplugged it and let it cool off since it got amazingly hot after that 3 min and i discovered the black, round casing with the holes in it that goes around the top, had melted itself open in the back.I loved this heater last year but can only give it 2 stars due to longevity."
1,Don't buy it.,"Granted, I've had the heater for a couple of years now... But for this price, the thing should last for years, walk the dogs, and babysit my kids if it's not actually going to heat my home office (10'x12'). Implication being that it doesn't heat my office. Exactly. The heater never worked well, and now it doesn't work at all. It turns on. And it blows warm air ineffectively for anywhere from 2.5 seconds to a minute, then it shuts itself off and doesn't come back on until you've completely forgotten about its existence and your hands are small blocks of ice. It absolutely will not stay on - but even when it was new and stayed on a little longer, it was pathetic. Complete junk. No idea where the receipt is. May roof test it because the entertainment I'd get for that would be worth well more than the little puffs of warm air it erratically produces."
3,Lasted for a year,I used this heater almost on a daily basis in my basement computer room. Worked great but was hard to get the right temperature. After a year it would shut off after a few minutes probably due to overheating. It would come back on for less than a minute after about five them get into this type of cycle over and over again.I will search for a more reliable product.
4,Endless entertainment,"For those of us who do not get into the techno jargon and play games for their entertainment value this game is endless funnnnn.I have been playing it off and on for almost 10 years and there are always new ways to try things and new combinations of tactics and weopons kinda like Sonic Drive in's they have 180,999 (estimated) drink combinations. This game has about that many tactical and weapons combinations. You can build an AC that is like and impregnable mountain or one that is light as a feather and can fly almost indefinately and avoid most things thrown at it with its quickness. This game is fun and the possibilities are built in you don't have to just beat up all the bad guys and say ""was that it""? ""is that it""? That is a slap in the face to people who work hours and hours creating all those possibilities and options that are built in to this game. Great Job"
3,Addictive but lacking,"I love this game. I also hate this game. The game play is great and your abilities to really customize your mechs is fantastic. I am a nit picker and one the appealing, yet also frustrating parts of this game is building and customizing the mechs. It really made me mad trying to put together the three best possible mechs I could. In some cases you could spend top dollar on every part and get a mech that was rated fair or just good. Other times you could vary between cheap and moderate and get an excellent or great rated mech. There was a stratagy building my mechs that made it fun. I gave this game only three stars because of graphics. Usually graphics don't mean that much to me, but this is a PS2 game and the main play graphics look like they belong on the PS1. It was very distracting for me. Solid game play, but poor graphics. I recomend renting this one first."
5,TOO GREAT FOR WORDS,This game is really worth buying for mech fans.They really changed the OK to the best.Really fun playing against your friend if he has this game also.Really looking forward for silent line because you can load your robot(AC) in the game.
3,not as good as 2,"Now, im a BIG fan of Armored Core 2. I lived and breathed the game for a month and a half. But sadly this new one doesnt stack up. Sure the graphics womp 2s, there r more cons than pros. For example, ""optional missions sides"" arnt optional. Sure, they say u can back out if u want, but u dont get any reward. And these sides r stupid and hard and pointless. Another thing that i dont like about any armored core is the fact that all the items are ""serial numbers"". It makes it impossible to navigate. Also in three, the print is tiny. I have to squint at the screen. And the games says u can remain loyal to someone if you want but u really cant. Becaurse i really like the group Union and i have to work aginst them now. .... But the game is still ok. It isnt worth the 42 dollars i paid for it. Go out and buy armored core 2 instead."
4,Really Great Game,"Im not really into Sci-Fi games or adventure games but this is a really enjoying game. I first played the demo and knew i had to have it. So I got on amazon.com and bought it. This is the funest game I have played in a long time. There are great graphics, well, awsome graphics, sweet looking aliens, and awsome voice. I dont know what others are saying about the game being 'too challenging' or 'impossible' because it is the perfect mix. They dont give too much health but you need to control how you use it because it is hard to find as you get moving in the game. I would give this game 5 stars but I dont like the auto-aim but I guess its worth 5 and a half stars."
2,Great game......if you're a prepubescent teen.,"Quite contrary to the other reviews ... and the enormous hype that surrounded this game....it's not good at all. the gameplay sucks. it's infuriatingly hard. not challenging mind you....but frustrating. the only redeeming quality to this game is the superb graphics. and maybe the great voice acting. this falls in with the seemingly endless array of mediocre games that get hype because they include cussing, naked chicks, and lot's of gratuitous blood and gore. not saying i don't enjoy these qualities in a game....but once you get out of puberty these things will not make a bad game good. it only works for youngins. so if you're 12-15 years of age, by all means pick this up. you'll love it. if you need a little more substance in your gameplaying like a good plot, good gameplay, and a not-so-impossible game, pick up something else."
5,512MB 533MHz 240 Pin DIMM from SimpleTech,"I bought this memory to expand RAM in my new DELL E521 desktop computer. I had no trouble in installing the memory and it worked perfect. I have been using the memory for the last 3 months and everything seems to be working fine. For the price, this one seems to be a great buy."
4,a master makes it look easy,"nick lowe has been writing great music for nearly 30 years, a feat few have managed...""dig my mood"" is a shift in gears to a more mellow, late-night with the lights down low mood that may catch long time fans by surprise, but stick with it and you'll indeed dig his mood."
4,mellow and melodic,"Nick caught a good groove with The Impossible Bird and he's sticking with it. Ther are some fabulous songs on this CD -- High on a Hilltop, Lonesome Reverie, What Lack of Love has Done, and Faithless Lover stand out as some of his best tunes ever (nearly thirty years counting Brinsley Schwartz). However, I always fast forward Freezing and You Inspire Me. Nick performs slow tracks very well (Shelly My Love, The Beast in Me) but these lack that edge.If you're thinking of buying a Nick CD, start with Impossible Bird, The Rose of England, Pure Pop for Now People (his best), and Rockpile's Seconds of Pleasure."
5,A great martini drinking album.,(If you're into that sort of thing.) I bought this album because I'm a huge Elvis Costello fan and Nick Lowe has produced so many of his albums. I wasn't disappointed. 'High on a Hilltop' and 'Freezing' and absolutely perfect.
4,Listen with the lights out,On first listen I was very dissappointed. I didn't listen to it again for a long time. Then one night after work I decided to give it another try. It sounded great. It might be one of the most relaxing CD's I have. Great to listen to after a bad day.
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Rohan and Sioned's son Pol is of the grown up variety now, and he gets to start doing the fantasy adventure thing himself.Star scrolls, dragons, other and different opposing types of magic, the odd concerned parent, a girl or two are some of the things he has to deal with."
2,not sandra at her best,"this is one of her earlist works,and certainly not her best.it's shallow and very flat."
5,"Great Book, wonderful love story.","Sandra Brown has done it again. I loved this story. Law sounded so intense and he sure acted cocky there for awhile, until he discovered he cared more for Marnie than he bargained for. Great read!"
3,Big Let Down,"This book was about a woman called doormat. There is so much wrong with this story that I can't even talk about it because I don't know where to start. Both main characters were horrible! I did like The character David, it was well written; he was a great kid, very lovable, smart, and understanding."
1,just bad,"Okay, this book even started off bad. i can't and won't finish it because it's so typical of all romance novels. I feel bad because Sandra Brown is not a bad author, she has the ability to write a good book. I am not one of her biggest fans and I don't search out her work, but the couple I have listened to were pretty good, unfortunately this book is not one of them.Skip this unless you just like the typical, silly romance novel."
1,Long Time coming,I thought this was THE Sandra Brown but apparently there are two authors with the same name - didn't care for this one..
5,A Long Time Coming by Sandra Brown,"Being able to read a little of the book certainly helps me decide if I want to purchase .I would like to know how thick the book is though . I am an avid , FAST reader and I can finish a book quickly . So I really like to know about a book I am considering buying .This was a good book and in great condition ."
3,This is another re-issue of a book.,"As an avid reader of Sandra Brown, I was thrilled to find a ""new"" book -- only to find after a few pages that I had read the story before. Yes, there are ways to discover if it is a re-issue -- mainly, checking the publication date in the front. On Internet shopping, it is not as convenient. So, I have multiple copies of favorite authors, many with different covers, thus adding to the shopper who is in a hurry and just grabs the book by her favorite author because she doesn't remember the cover."
4,My True Review,"This is a great book, its interesting and will keep you reading. The last chapter is so heart-warming it just makes you want to hug the book. Marnie is pretty relatable and everything felt very real, the emotions too. If you enjoy a fast-paced romance with a twist, you should definitely read it."
3,Long Time Coming by Sandra Brown,"I enjoyed the story, but book was smaller that I expected. I wanted more story."
1,tired of her conservative views..,"I am getting a little tired of Sandra Brown's anti-abortion views. In every book of hers where someone gets pregnant there is always a line about how they would never stoop to abort the kid. So here, the heroine's sister is passed off as a slut, where the hero bore equal responsibility for being careless. I hated the book. It pins the blame squarely on women and Brown needs to get rid of the notion that women are solely responsible for their actions. It reappears again and again in her other books. She is fast falling off my favorite author list."
3,My 2 Sense,"I picked this up one Saturday just to pass the time, I loved it at first, but that love dwindled as the book neared the end. I liked Laws character at first; it was his actions that miffed me. Like the birthday gift, and the living arrangements. It didn't appear as though he had any regard or respect for the woman who had rearranged her life to rear his child alone. Especially at such a young age. And as a single mother myself, I have to say, I kept waiting for David (her son) to choose Marnie over Law, to make it clear that she hadn't been replaced by this arrogant, famous, rich ....person. It burned me that he didn't. And as for Marnie, I wanted her to make Law beg a little more, she made it to easy for him. I wanted her to move away and make him chase her. Anyway, that's my two sense. Go ahead ...read it. A word of caution to single mothers: Be prepared."
4,Not so long in coming,"As an avid Sandra Brown fan, I will first say of course I loved this book. But however, it is not one of her best. I struggled with the fact that Law comes into the life of David with no real regard to the woman that had been his mother for 16yrs. How like an irresponsible dad to just sail in and take over when it happens to be convenient. But like all romances there is a happy ending. Don't let this be your first Sandra Brown or it may be your last."
3,Long Time Coming,You asked so here goes. I become very despondent when I order a book at full price only to find it was written in 1988 and I had already read it. It was good enough to read again because I was totally out of choices. Therefore I picked 3 stars instead of the 1 I wanted to give it. I could not fairly punish the book for my poor memory. BUT I do resent the practice of pawning off old material on unsuspecting readers. So there!!
1,Aww geez,"I really did not like this book, and unfortunately, it is the only experience I have had with Sandra Brown, so I probably won't be reading her again. I thought the characters were annoying, and the story and dialogues were unbelievably cheesy. I think somewhere in the first chapter or so, David says ""geez"" or something like that and Marnie tells him not to use that kind of language...Did I miss something? That kind of tainted the whole thing for me, but even if that hadn't happened, I doubt I would have liked the book any better. Basically, it sucked."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I am not a big reader and usually do not have any trouble putting a book down to finish the next day. However, this was not the case with this little one. I couln't put it down when each chapter was ending. Sandra Brown worked her magic and has you wanting more. The result - I read it in one sitting. The only problem was I started the book when I couldn't sleep at 1:00 AM!"
4,"Drummer's can write, too!","nice record. fresh, french pop. Pino's(bass) playing is exemplary. of course, Manu has more ""feel"" than he gets credit sometimes. songs have nice anticipation and flow. buy this cd....you will enjoy....."
5,"Manu , The hidden talent","If you are a fan of Manu , this is a MUST HAVE. It is not a Zildjian endorsing CD. Manu plays in the pocket , and is backed up by master players such as Pino,Dominic,Simon, and David. The compositions are tasty and texturous. BUY THIS CD. TURN IT ON TO YOUR FRIENDS."
1,Not even an okay read!,"One of the cover blurbs said the first three pages were just fantastic (or words to that effect). And they pretty much were - they had a real sense of dread. The rest of the book was a let down. The young boys weren't interesting or engaging. They were boys for only a few chapters and then they were adults and even less interesting. As for the plot -- did anyone really understand it? It was so complicated it ended up being laughable. I won't go into it if someone has the time to waste reading it, but I in no way recommend this book."
1,Don't waste your time.,"This book is supposed to be superior to 'It'??? Laughable. There is no character development, no atmosphere. It is supposed to to be about a group of young friends battling this monster. They are young boys for a few chapters. Then one is dead and they are grown up. Stupid explaination, just awful all the way around. If you want to read an excellant book about childhood friends fighting a truly scary 'monster', then the aforementioned 'IT' by Stephen King is your best bet."
3,Fiction... not Art,"As a long time fan of horror, I found this book to be exceedingly average in every department. The narration itself is as plain and literal as can be... don't even bother looking for a higher meaning. No clever phrasing or play of words, no subtle allusions or ambiguity. Generic story with generic characters. It's not bad, but I look for something more than ""competent"" when I'm committing the time."
2,Buyer Beware,"I regret that I did not research this book more carefully before buying it (one of the hazards of not being able to leaf through a book being sold on-line). The title of this book led me to assume that it would be a carefully-selected collection of Mr. Murray's best columns since his career began in 1961. Wrong. Except for one column from 1961, the book only has his columns from 1990 to 1998, columns he wrote after he received the Pulitzer Prize. Wouldn't a reader expect to see selected columns he wrote since the beginning of his career? After all, these are the ones which earned him his Pulitzer, not the ones after 1990! Some of Mr. Murray's most caustic columns were written early in his career. Sadly, this book does not provide them. The title of this book is misleading."
5,As good as it gets,"Jim Murray combined sports insight with the ability to craft a sentence like none other. With Hollywood as a backdrop, he understood that professional sports are equal parts athleticism and entertainment. Personalities are often the focus of his writing and he entertains whether writing about superstars or journeymen.If you are any type of baseball fan, then the tribute to Big D and Reggie's Hall of Fame induction are worth way more than the price of this book."
2,Do you prefer look over comfort?,"These boots ARE very cute.Goes great with many outfits.I got them in sz 8.5,and fits like a 9.My heals began burning within an hour. And by the end of the day, my heals were scraped, pretty bad. still healing at the end of the week. definitely not shoes for long walks, or maybe it was my pair that was carelessly made."
4,"Individual Packets of Neosporin, rather expensive but marketed for First Aid","I have added these to my first aid kits, and there they remain. The packets are well sealed and printed very well. I can't say more without using them, which I hope I'll never do.I give them four stars on the basis of the tubes of triple antibiotic ointment that they allegedly contain. 5 stars will have to wait for some spectacular success and lower ratings for a huge failure.Nice to have in a light kit for bicycling/hiking/etc."
2,"Kinda Cheap, but fun",This product is cheap-looking. Like something you might buy at a county fair. My wife wears it occasionally for fun--but I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Horrible face!,"I Don't recomend teh Doll, the face is really ugly and istot a good quality. I got it thiking it was like the barbies"
5,Awesome tea,"This tea is incredible. Mind you I am not an avid tea drinker. I'm more of a coffee person. I bought this tea to alleviate stress and deal with irritability. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it tastes wonderful too. The aroma in itself is calming and the lavender and slight anis flavors are just incredible. It combines the benefits of great flavor, being really calming without putting you to sleep, and easing tummy troubles like bloating and indigestion. It is a truly enjoyable tea. I just bought 6 boxes and am about to stock up on some more."
4,Good Tea: But BEWARE,"Although this is a very good tea and it does calm me down, anyone suffering from an immune deficiency or Candida should not drink this tea as it contains barley malt, which I did not realize until I had a bad reaction. Otherwise it is a great tea and does as advertised. Just watch the ingredients, I seemingly over looked the ""Other Ingredients"". Now I have to give the tea to house guests, it's so disappointing."
5,AWESOME!,Calms VERY WELL. Tastes great with honey but that's a personal choice. Best stuff! Can't wait to try their other teas!
2,Made my heart pound ?,I bought this tea at Stop and Shop and it clearly has warnings on it but I didn't expect it to cause like a panic attack or something uncomfortable like my heart to beat loudly as it was audible. I don't fancy the flavor of this tea. Yogi makes a sampler with this one in it.
4,"Good, don't know some songs","I am very happy with this set, but it seems that as the CDs get higher in number (four and five) fewer of the songs are from the more popular Disney movies. If that doesn't bother you, then you will be happy with this set. If you want to recognize every song on every CD, go out and watch every Disney movie ever made, and some of the musicals first. Then buy the set. I highly recommend this for any Disney fan."
4,Almost Welcome Return,"Little Axe ""The house that wolf built"" and Sacred Spirit II are two of my most played albums both offering a new direction of the blues which my friends can't believe I love. Little axe's second album (slow fuse) was good but in general lack direction. Hard Grind has elements of 'Wolf' but does not quite measure up. Some of the tracks are brilliant with the most significant tracks being those which a band could translated to non-dub and often involve the harmonica of Alan Glen. The album is still worth the money, but for a blues lover, some tracks head in other directions and two are absolutely infuriating: One 'Tight like that' with (I hope) a pretend preacher's spiel and another with a sendup of the 23rd psalm I could do without."
4,It's Barney so of course they love it,"I gave this four stars because my kids liked it. It's a typical Barney video. Nothing spectacular, but my kids liked it."
3,It was okay,Granddaughters still like Barney but this is not one of the best. Wasn't horrible but just wasn't as good as we were expecting.
5,Love this video,"I got this for my daughter when she was 15 months. She absolutely loves it and dances the whole time, names the animals and loves the songs.It is well-paced. She does not have many videos as I am selective with what I buy and let her watch, but I definitely recommend this one."
2,not really that good,"I'm surprised this one got such good reviews. I was excited to show it to my daughter since she LOVES Barney's Sing and Dance but she got bored very quickly. If you need to choose just one Barney DVD, I would definitely get Barney's Sing and Dance hands down - it's mostly all songs (very cute and fun) with lots of dancing plus lots of farm animals including a dog! My daughter is 17 months now but started watching it at around 14 months and now knows all of the songs. Mr. Sun is her favorite. Hope this helps!"
5,Barney's Let's Go To The Farm,"This has been a long-time favorite with my grandchildren (ages 4 & 2). In fact, I had to purchase this new CD because of the previous one was so scratched up. I personally love this CD as well."
5,Was very pleased.,I do in home daycare and my two year olds love it. It holds their attention while teaching them about the farm and lots of other things. I think that they would watch it all day if I allowed them to. Good choice. Fun songs.
1,Wrong Language,"The cover said the disc was in English. When I start to play it, it was in Spanish.Go figure this one out."
4,Good show,"My 14 month old is learning about animals right now, and we use this video while on long trips for her to identify the animals. She gets excited when she sees each one. This is a great episode if your little one is learning about or enjoys animals."
3,Keep it simple,Barney is such a likeable character. I only wish there were less people and more speaking from Barney. Definitely not for children under the age of 2. Too much going on and background distractions. Younger children can learn to focus with more simplified presentations.
3,Entertaining for my Granddaugther,"On purpose I have 'introduced' my granddaughter to Barney, much to my son's chagrin (laughing while I write this). Seriously though, she has another video and this one didn't appeal as much because it had far more talking in it than music. She is only one year old and is more drawn to the music and bright colors of the other video. Other than that, this is a fine one, especially for a child a bit older, say around 2ish."
5,great for little animal lovers,"I bought this for my 19 month old daughter, who is my third child. We had lots of Barney videos for our oldest child when she was little, but the middle child didn't care for him so we had given most of the old vhs tapes to friends. When I saw this I had to get it for Maisy because she wants anything with sheep in it. We have several ""barnyard"" type videos, like I said, anything with a sheep, and this is the best one.I love all the animal footage, even though all she really notices is the ""BAAAAA."" All the rest of the animals are kitties to her, but she loves it and she loves the animals and wants to pet the screen.Unlike many parents, I have never been a Barney hater. I always thought he was pretty good but since my earlier Barney experiences nearly ten years ago, he has improved even more. If your child likes animals, especially farm animals, you need this in your collection!"
5,My daughter is obsessed!,"My little girl is 16 months old and adores this video. I have since bought her other Barney DVD's and she shows no interest in them and seems upset that it's not the farm video. In fact, she really doesn't like any TV except for Toddler Tunes on cable's Music Choice and the movie ""Babe"" to some extent. The 2 children in this particular one are so engaging and Baby Bop is really funny to me (I know it's a guy i that suit and I get a huge kick out of him!) Also, she loves farm animals and her first ""words"" after Mama and Dada were ""Moo"" and Quack, quack!"" But I would highly recommend this one. I am going to try the Let's go to the Zoo one, hoping it's a similar format, because she loves animals like elephants and big cats."
5,The Cat's Out of the Bag,"Rabinowitz' translation omits footnotes because he works glosses poetically into the text, or comes up with a modern equivalent that makes the meaning clear -- thus he has Catullus nurse himself back to health with ""chicken soup"" instead of the 'correct' ""nettle broth"" -- so, as he explains, the reader can enjoy the poems, and not play peek-a-boo with the footnotes.//This is the style of translation used by Jerome in the Vulgate, by de Nerval in his Faust -- in short, wherever a real poet is doing the work. Such endeavors have never pleased the impotent old fogies -- which is almost the definition of a Classicist -- who like their translations, like their authors, dead.//Bravo for Rabinowitz! And a pity Amazon doesn't carry his scriptural translation ""The Unholy Bible.&quot"
4,Does the job,"This is a great buy. It keeps the car noticeably cooler, and stores easily. However, it's a little stiff, but after a few uses it's ok.."
4,Old time storytelling for modern radio,"This set of 5 discs is a terrific presentation of Seeing Ear Theater's stab at Tales from the Crypt. The production and acting is quite good as are the tales themselves. Really nothing to complain about other than the lack of the 3rd story from the series THIS TRICK'LL Kill Ya.Please someone release CITY OF DREAMS on CD, another terrific SET production."
5,Sony KDL 32 S3000,This is close to the finest smaller LCDs on the market. Great picture and detail in HD and my only gripe would be the sound quality. I use it in my bedroom and the size is great.
2,disappointed,"I, like everyone else, expected the Sony Bravia 32"" to be flawless. However, I have to say that I am disappointed in the picture quality. Purchasing this solely for blue ray discs, I am sorry to report that there is a noticeable fuzz on the screen when playing blue rays(you can only notice this from a couple feet away;) but still . . . I expected a crystal clear picture in return for my $800 investment. I am considering purchasing a Sharp Aquos 1080p; however, it has come to my attention that there is no discernible difference between a 780p (Sony Bravia) and a 1080p in the 32"" class.That being said, I am still a tad upset. Standard dvd's do not always look good; and some look awful. Blue rays are better and vivid, but that fuzz on the screen really vexes me."
2,"Too many problems, bad customer support","My new SONY KDL-323000 TV has several problems.1. Closed Captions work only with regular connection. When I connect my TV to a cable box or DVD player using HDMI or Component inputs, Closed Captions disappear. Turning it On and Off is not helping. Technical support blames my cable box, but why in this case can I see CC from the same box using the coaxial input?BTW, when I submitted technical support request online, I never got any response at all.2. Standby light is always Off. Supposed to be On.3. When I connect my laptop to the TV according to the manual I can see picture, but sound is missing. I tried different audio cables, but it did not help. Technical support could not tell me exactly what kind of audio cable to use.Too many problems for $1000 TV. I am really disappointed."
5,Very good choice,"I think that is a very good choice. Exelent image, exelent sound enough imputs. Recommend 100%."
5,"32"" Sony Bravia","I love it. It has a very clear picture even with only standard cable. I also appreciate all the extra features like the low power option as well as the timer to turn the televison on. I am a deep sleeper and it works well with my alarm clock. I can choose time, channel and volume that I would like to wake up to without changing my current channel or volume."
4,enjoy,well made product. caution when trailering. the doors will open causeing taring. five star for amazon customer support.
4,Not All Treasure Is In The Sea,"Found this to be a very interesting paperback book for anyone dreaming of treasure hunting/finds. But, I wish it was updated. I'm sure there are more interesting things about Florida. Not all of Fla. treasure finds are in the sea as this book notes. Worth reading.Open anywhere and begin reading."
4,good info,Thorough information. The details had to be a massive undertaking for the author. The series is worthwhile for any collector.
4,Creativity is Hard to Teach,"I found the poet's thoughts quite helpful and not as self-indulgent as other reviewers. I think Roethke also considered himself to be an artist at teaching as well as at writing. His was not a case of ""those cannot do, teach"". He established a style of relating and conveying materials to students with many years of success. Most importantly, no teacher can instruct how to be a good or great writer. Every instructor in the arts faces this dilemma.I found Roethke's thoughts to have much merit. They aren't obtrusive or intrusive just a catch as catch can if they have meaning for the reader."
1,3+ years of repairs!,"This particular 60"" KDS-R60XBR1 product from SONY is a $3,500++ piece of junk. Within the first 8 months of purchase, we had the dreaded green tint. Repair #1 warranty. 8 months later, GREEN hue. SONY did pay for repair post warranty. Issue #3, lamp goes out! $350/repair. Issue #4 play DVD, goes green again! Issue #5, Lamp goes out again! Finally, this morning, the old red blinking light (4 times) means a service call AGAIN! 6 Issues in 3.5 years on a SONY and nearly $1,000 in repairs. It's like a bad relationship you keep going back to after a problem. Well, NO MORE! Off to buy a new 60"" big screen. I don't know what the engineers were doing when they designed this at SONY. Must have been a team of new graduates. SONY is usually so reliable. My biggest gripe is that they should have had a total recall when so many problems arose and replaced the full TV with a different model."
2,not a long term review,"i had just purchased this tv from bestbuy on sale $1799, lugged it home, dragged it up 2 flights of stairs, hooked up all wires and connections and did the initial setup. Picture looks great, but wait, whats that high pitch noise? Sounds like a smoke alarm only not as loud but very high pitched. Even when i turn off tv it still makes the noise. Only by unplugging did it solved the problem. Called customer service, when thru the whole ordeal of their step by step protocols and about 1 hr later, no fix but now they have all my info they collected from me to send me more promotions and advertisement. So now less than 3 hours from purchase i returned it to bestbuy, they tested it and found same problem but didnt have another model to exchange with. Disappointed at first, but later after reading more reviews im glad they were out of the tv. I knew there must have been a reason that a $2600 tv was now being sold for $1799."
4,Still cranking,"I've had this TV for 2 years now,and the picture is still great. There have been major advances in LCDs since, but this picture still rivals all others."
3,Sony KDS-R50XBR worked great for almost 4 years,"This TV was purchased in late summer of 2006 and has delivered excellent, trouble-free picture quality until about January 2010. Now the picture has developed a green tint that is uniformly over entire screen. Have been told that it is the light engine and it will have to be replaced. The bill could be as much as a $1000, with labor."
1,It WAS too good to be true.,"When ""everyone"" (friends, co-workers, consumer reviews) said the Sony Wega SXRD was THE BEST HDTV, I splurged and spent $2600 in January 2007 on a KDS-R50BR1 as a retirement gift for myself. The picture wasn't as sharp as I expected but I blamed it on the antiquated cable wiring in my apartment building. Nine months later the screen went black and the ""fun"" began - scheduling and waiting for repairmen, sending the set to the repair shop, waiting for part after back-ordered part to be tried in the set. After eight weeks of repeated phone calls to the dealer, repair shop and Sony, Sony finally gave me a replacement - a REFURBISHED set, the same model as the piece of junk that I bought. What a nightmare! Now that I'm learning about all the problems others are having I'm just waiting for it to start all over again. My confidence in Sony is shot."
2,Fixing Green Screen cost more than TV now,This TV gets a green tint that takes over. The extended warrenty with the company went until June 30th 2009. To replace the part cost $1500 with installation. Get maybe 2 years with a good picture then your out of luck. This is a bad purchase and I'm stuck with it.
1,Optical engine failing on these sets.,"Bought mine in Jan. 2006. I now have the infamous yellow stripe of death down the right side of the screen. I left the future of any sony purchases from this customer up to how sony dealt with this issue. Very poor... part is backordered and, from what I've read, the new part has other imperfections. Only a few customers are getting full replacement tv's. They wouldn't replace mine, even when I wanted to pay extra for an upgraded set. Guess its who you know. Sony has gone down hill. I will never purchase another sony product again."
1,Old Information,You will not pass the current Adaptive Exams with these guides. They are a combination of information from old Exams Crams packaged together. Just a sales gimmic. I suggest the book A+ Adaptive Exams.
2,Weak WrestleMania,"Hogan vs. Slaughter is definitely the worst WrestleMania main event of all time (so far). They were both old and slow, even back in this 1991 match. By the time this match happened, the Gulf War had been over for months anyway. Ultimate Warrior vs. Randy Savage was a classic, though. The other title matches were weak as well. I would have rather seen LOD vs. The Hart Foundation for the tag titles. All in all, this was not a great PPV, but it had it's moments."
4,One Of The Better Wrestlemanias...,"This was one of the best WrestleManias of all time. The tag team match between the Hart Foundation and the Nasty Boys was exceptional. The main event lacked quite a bit of speed, but it made up for it by making people hate Sgt. Slaughter.The best match of the tape, however, is the ""Loser Retires From Wrestling"" Match featuring Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage against the Ultimate Warrior. For about 20 minutes, both wreslted their bodies out. Finally, Warrior gets the pin. Scary Sherri attacks Savage and his (real life) wife Elizabeth comes out and saves him, reuniting with him and setting up his comeback about ten months later.The bad match: the late Kerry Von Erich vs. the late Dino Bravo. Within two years, both men were dead; they did not perform much better than that in this match.So-so match: the blindfold match pitting Rick Martel against Jake Roberts."
4,"WWF WrestleMania 7: ""Superstars and Stripes Forever"" Review","This was a very good WrestleMania. There were two excellent matches on this card: The first great match was the career-ending match between The Ultimate Warrior and ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage. Warrior kicked out of five elbows from the top rope, but Savage kicked out of the gorilla press. In the end, Savage got back together with Elizabeth in touching (gross!) moment. The next big match was the world title match. Hulk Hogan faced the Heavyweight Champion: Sergeant Slaughter. It was amazing to me that Slaughter could hold up that long against Hogan, but they produced a very good match. Just another example of the kind of quality wrestling Vince McMahon brings to the viewer. That's one of the reasons the WWF is number one and the WCW really...isn't number one."
5,THE BEST WRESTLEMANIA OF ALL TIME! (BY LEWIS SMALES),"Wrestlemania VIII is the best of all time, Hogan/Justice to me was one of Hogan's greatest matches to me and the crowd noise was great which made this video very very exciting.The match for the champion ship was also a great math between Flair/Savage. This video is worth everything it gets. Worth the purchase. THE BEST OF ALL TIME!"
3,good undercard,well the overall show was pretty good. the warrior/savage career match was great.the snuka/taker match was short but still good. the rockers in the first match was great. tito santana and the mountie was horrible and borring.bossman/perfect match was good with the return of aundre the giant befor his death. but the main event was such a snooze. you knew they werent going to have hogan loose to a heel at wrestlmain's main event. way to predictable. plus slaughter could hardely even kick hogan because he has no talent what was wwf thinking when they gave him the belt.so i am gonna say just rent this one.
4,WWE WrestleMania 7 review,"The tag team bout between The Rockers against Haku & The Barbarian was pretty good for a opener. The World tag team title bout between The Hart Foundation & The Nasty Boys was a hard-hitting,smash mouth match. The Blindfold match between Jake Roberts & Rick Martel was a slow,boring,dumb,pointless comedy filler. The match between The Undertaker & Jimmy Snuka was kind-of one-sided but still a memberable bout mainly becuase it was the beginning of the Undertaker's undefeated streak. The Retirement match between Randy Savage & The Ultimate Warrior was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth,entertaining brawl. The IC title match between Mr.Perfect & The Big Bossman was not great but pretty good and the same goes for the Ted DiBiase-Virgil match. The L.O.D-Power & Glory tag team match was a 59 second stinkfest. The Hulk Hogan-Sgt.Slaughter-World title match was a entertaining,bloody,back-and-forth,smash-mouth bout. The rest were ok. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10."
5,Great Product. Great price,Great Product. Fast Shipping. I am using it for the HTC Dash S620 and works great.
5,SolidGreat,"Good price, new product, as advertised, and quick delivery. Buying doesn't get any better than from this seller."
2,"Descriptive notation, no credits, and inferior diagrams","I have a moderately sized chess library (100+ books), and this work is one of my least favorites. Besides having descriptive (i.e., old, non-algebraic) notation, the puzzle collection suffers from numerous other problems. The positions often appear composed rather than naturally occurring, and no credit is given regarding who created the puzzles to be solved. Further, the print quality of the diagrams is sub par, which means that solving the problems straight from the book isn't as easy as it should be. Overall, this book is quite a disappointment. I recommend that you pick up another tactics book for middlegame or endgame practice."
1,boy band bashing,"another boy band is here to clog up the radio signals and ravage our childrens minds. i say, ""bring on the zeppelin"" until any decent contemporary music proves itself decent enough to listen without bleeding from the ears. (oh yes, i wrote this because i wanted to know if the last track was the dylan version or just so other song. im not going to listen to it or anything, it will just give an old man one more thing to curse about)"
4,"Time consuming, but great results",">>>Your first copy WILL NOT be as dark as you expected.<<<If you're still shopping around > get the Verbatim spindle, as it seems to print much darker on your first try.If you're stuck with the HP spindle > here is the trick: don't panic if your first copy doesn't look good. The disks have a little ring in the middle that tells the burner exactly where to start/resume burning > this means you can put THE SAME disk in the burner and re-print the image, thus resulting in a much darker print. If you have the time to tinker with it, burn it 2-3 or even 4 times for the results you're looking for.Trust me > I had the same exact reaction at first, but I love working with lightscribe now.Problem solved."
1,Disappointed in Atlanta,"DO NOT buy these HP Lightscribe discs. They are unreliable. My PC recovery discs (2 different sets) have both failed.For absolute top quality DVD+R media or CDs, buy Taiyo-Yuden. I believe that Amazon sells these, or others do too. They're slightly more expensive, but you will not have failures."
5,Water float,"This item is perfect for a day at the lake or pool! It comes with cup holders, and the center portion is removable for options. This float is big! I love it. The back pillow is removable as well."
3,Big And Comfy But The Center Pillow Is Not Fixed,"Overall, this float is worth the money. The one problem that I have with the design is that the center pillow pops out when getting onto the float. I have to wrestle it back into place. On days when the water is cold, you'll get wet."
4,"Best intentions, saddest results...","Let me say this is a well written treatise and worth reading. It is a piece of history to be reviewed. However, I don't buy into liberation theology and do not apologize for believing in the free enterprise system. Teach a man to fish and he will fish. Teach a man to make nets and a boat and he will produce. Teach a man to market the fish, boat and nets and he will sell. Not really an evil concept in itself. What has happened and is happening in Haiti is a tragic story. One can blame the US, France and others. One can blame a harsh climate, endemic disease and poor resources. One can also blame the self-grown despots who ""governed"" Haiti. Unfortunately Mr Aristide ""talked a good ball game"" but played no better than the rest, in fact, was worse than most. He lifted the people up only to dash them down. The book is hypocritical to it's core. It falls into the abyss with previous socialist and communist manifestos."
2,Working but not satisfied,I manage to returned those chime alarm to my Chevy 2008 after market Radio replacement but the chime trigger only once. For overspeeding alarm you have to stay at 120 kph for about 15 seconds before single alarm heard. same in hand break warning. It will not give you warning that the hand break is engaged when car is on the move. It will trigger only after 15 seconds and only one bit of chime only
5,Love this light,"This is an excellent spot light. My 100 yard target is bright after dark with this light. Objects at 180 yards are clearly visible, with colors and other features also easy to see. I love this simple c cell battery (4). No need to recharge, and batteries are available anywhere without getting ripped off with some exotic battery. You want be disappointed with this one!"
5,LED light,"This LED spotlight is one of the best purchases I have made. Heavy duty construction, super bright light, and the ease of 4 C batteries (which they provide for you). You can't go wrong here!"
5,DORCY SPOTLIGHT,"I received this Dorsey light about a year ago. It had a silver cover but is the same unit as shown here. It uses 4 C size batteries and puts out a bright spot light that can be seen for about 300-400 feet. I have never had to replace the batteries in the year I have had the unit util just now. I have used this light a great deal. I am in the Coast Guard Aux. and use this light on the water on a regular basis to inspect and check aids to navigation. I just purchased another one of these lights as a back up. I have not received it as yet. This is the best flashlight, for the money, that you can buy."
3,"B Buckles, the author","This is my book. It includes everything I documented at the time.There are no photos in this book, but there are chapter dividersand a separate chapter for each of the 7 children of FrederickAugustus Mealio and Jennie Clark Carruthers. Also there is an indexat the end of each chapter. The book is 8 1/2 X 5 1/2 with a combbinding."
4,Flux welding wire,This is a much better product than comes with the flux machine. It still has it's share of splatter but I can live with this amount of ill effects. It's making a decent welder out of this 65 year young retiree.
3,"Not a twin pack, false advertising","Picture was of a twin pack as in 2 spools not 1, whereas the price I was charged 23.00 for the 1 I could have bought 2 for 30.00 at Tractor supply, no savings here, very disappointed.UPDATE: after a single complaint to Amazon, they credited my account back $11.50, which I thought was very fair, so the single roll was now only 12.50 or 2.50 savings over anyone else. I stll think the photo should changed............."
3,The picture is wrong,The picture shows a twin pack. It is NOT a twin pack. I didn't read the other reviews first. Lesson learned. I was thinking that I was saving money. It wound up costing me eleven bucks more than if purchased locally. Good product. Deceptive advertising.
5,Utterly Engrossing True Crime Stories of Classic Author...,I loved the investigative work of Arthur Conan Doyle in his snippets from actual cases of his day and generation. Once you start reading this fascinating book you will not be able to put it down. It beats anything from modern true crime (which I normally enjoy) because it has the historical significance and an almost otherworldly feel to it. Great book!
3,Shipping package was insufficient,"I purchased these candles as part of a gift over the holidays, and I was disappointed when they arrived in an envelope with no packing material. The box was damaged and the candles were slightly scuffed as a result. Amazon usually does a great job shipping, so this was surprising. The quality of the candles seemed just fine, this was a shipping problem."
3,"Class Clown a Classic, but dated.","George Carlin was a pioneer in comedy. Along with Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder, Carlin helped change the text of comedy. Challenging the Status Quo by not playing safe with material, Carlin made people listen and think. Class Clown is great for those of us who were around in the 1970's We can remember and relate to the majority of the material. It is a must have CD for any collector of proper comedy, but if you are a novice I suggest you go for Carlin's later stuff. This recording speaks of the Vietnam war, so if you are too young to remember 'Nam then this CD may not be for you. A nice walk down memory lane with many laughs, but not for everyone."
5,My 2nd favorite Carlin album.,"I love this album, I can listen to it over and over. Even knowing what comes next does not reduce the ability to make me laugh(much). Not something you can say about many comedy albums. Absurd Carlin at his best, from before his angry humor. His angry humor still made me laugh, but the absurd stuff had the ability to literally make me roll on the floor, laughing helplessly until my stomach hurt."
4,The Victorian Internet,"Excellent book by British author who follows the invention and development of the telegraph with an emphasis on changes wrought in commerce, industry, governments, etc., drawing parallels to the digital revolution and the internet of today. He fails to mention the leap to radio telegraphy brought about by Marconi and others."
4,Good,"Interesting book. I like the way that it is written, and it is a steady read. Have to read it for class, but good none-the-less."
5,We've Been Here Before,"As an IT guy, it's nice to see the parallels of the internet and the early phone system. Especially how hard it was to convice people that the phone is an effective (and cost effective) communication tool. I can almost predict what reactions to the internet are going to happen next!! Great reading if you like this type of thing."
4,"Great book, horrible ecopy...","A compelling read that is well-written, but the typos in the e-version for Kindle appear with an alarming and annoying frequency. Did anyone copy-edit this, or was it rapidly converted without any attention to detail?"
4,Parallels Galore,"The idea of this book is that the telegraph had much the same effect for the Victorians, as the internet has on our own times. The world got smaller: markets became more efficient and larger and diplomats had to respond to crises in real time. Journalists had to adapt and organize syndicates for gathering and sharing information. Codes and ciphers increased in importance and commercial value while governments futilely tried to control and restrict their use. All of these things are as familiar to us, as it was to the Victorians.Sandage has done a credible job in researching the parallels and tells the story with plenty of amusing asides and anecdotes, making for an easy read. The stories about how the telegraph was used in affairs of the heart, and the ingenuity of criminals to find innovative methods of practicing their craft shows one more time that there is little really new under the sun."
5,Don't miss this one,"This is a wonderful, readable books that instructs on many levels.First, there is the comparison obvious in the name, and the conclusion that we can turn to history for instruction about the present.Second is the stories of visionaries that took huge risks to make the electric telegraph happen.Finally, it is tied together with stories of regular people that made it all happen, from crime to romance it reminds us that our Internet is only important to the extent it affects the lives of the people who use it."
2,Could have been a great story.,"The author missed what could have been a great story in this journalistic (in the worst sense of the word) story of this fascinating invention. The hook which attempts to link the telegraph with the internet is a strained metaphor -- an attempt to make the book relevant.Missed or lightly touched on is how the telegraphy truly changed the world -- how wars were fought, how business is conducted. Instead we get a lot of the fluffy stories of people getting married by telegraph etc.Also glossed over are any real technical details about how the various gadgets worked. The author obviously doesn't know the difference between a volt and jolt and assumes the readers are equally ignorant.Pity because the relationship between invention and history is a great story and the telegraph is a great way of telling this story. This book just skims the surface."
5,Really interesting stuff,"I really enjoyed this book. It was really easy to read, and contained all sorts of interesting information. I had no idea how entrenched in peoples lives the Telegraph was!"
2,"Perfect example of a ""McBook.""","For those looking for original research or depth of insight into the launching of the remarkable communications web the telegraph was, you'll be disappointed. Sandage does a nice job of mining the existing history to prove his single point of the parallel impact of telegraph and the Internet. The book is likely of value to readers wanting only a recitation of dates and events. The book gives support to an acquaintance's observation that what we need today is ""another category of Pulitzer Prize; one for the best investigative paragraph.&quot"
3,Telegraph,"The technical creation of the kindle edition had numerous typos and some strange spacing. The book was good, but only cursory. I would have preferred more depth of analysis and greater insight"
5,DIFFERENT AND EXITING,"THE CLASSIC BATTLE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL WITH AN ORIGINAL SETTING AND STORY LINE. PREJUDICE, EXPLOITATION AND GREED ARE MET BY FAIRNESS,DETERMINATION AND COURAGE."
5,Great Gi at a Great Price,"These are terrific. The pants actually fit my daughter with the top rolled once (she is tiny), and the weight is perfect. The are well made, and the price is great too."
4,"Books are nice, but having them on my laptop is perfect!","I'm an editorial freelancer, so I haul my laptop around a lot between multiple clients' offices. Inspired by a review here at Amazon, I ordered the book/CD combo, and it's been great! I keep the books on my desk in the ""home office,"" and I installed the software on my PowerBook.The Mac interface is not very well designed--it takes a lot of mouse clicks to get from word to word, and there don't seem to be any keyboard shortcuts--but it gets the job done soooo much faster than thumbing through the book when I'm on a deadline. I use it constantly."
2,deceptive photo,Photo shows a 3 piece set but you get only 2 books and a piece of paper. The third piece in the photo implies a CD but it is instead just a free download. I could have bought the two books separately for less money. I didn't know the CD was separate and additional.
2,My Blessing Is on the Way,"I am totally disappointed in this CD, There is only one song that I trully enjoy. When I purchased this CD, I expected to aleast enjoy three of the song."
5,BEAUTIFUL AND UNIQUE,I ordered this for my wedding and everyone complimented it because it was so different fromt the traditional...it was beautiful and I would recommend it to any bride and groom or anniversary couple!!
1,Sickening,"A talented writer who choses to exploit the atrocities against the non-white world to line her pockets. We all know how Australiawas settled; we are aware of the ongoing atrocities in the globe. Must we go there again with these dark, violent images?There is enough present day violence without having to re-live the past in sickening detail. How can she sleep?"
3,Much less then expected,"I really bought this book, I mean physically, I have it at home as paperback and also I has it scanned. So strong was my interest to the country, author, title, plot, etc.So what can I say? First of all, thank you, Kate, it was obviously a big work.Also Kate Grenville is obviously strong in dialogs and female psychology.All the rest is totally dead frame, not more then good skeleton for some future epical monstrous movie. So somebody else has to breathe the life into this product. I suppose with good cameraman it is possible.Taking into account that Kate is absolute zero in scenery and animals, this book actually is not about the Australia.Possibly this book is about the british character, it more related to UK, its history, etc. And the picture drawn is awful and pity, I would say.So the plot and the real author intentions went the different roads here, and existed in two different places, from my point of view."
1,Disappointing,"The first part of this book about the ""waterman"" in London was good. The development of the colony at New South Wales by the thieves showed corruption in high places and an attitude of ""I'll get mine"" by the deportees. The treatment of the aborigines was sad. If you want a feel-good book this is not for you. Very depressing."
3,The secret river,This is completely different from my regular books that I purchase. I'm not sorry that I purchased it as it was an interesting read. I enjoyed learning about the main character from his childhood to adulthood and thought. The author did a good job on taking the reader through it. If you're looking for a good book that isn't a nailbiter you may want to read this.
4,Adventurous,"This book held my interest throughout and seems to be fairly accurate of the times as we know them. Both a family adventure and a case for making the best of an unfortunate circumstance. This could be the story of many who were the original ""unwilling"" immigrants to Australia! Will look for other books by this author now."
2,Slow starting.,"Once I put it down, it was a chore to pick it back up and continue. Very slow moving. The characters seem flat and uninteresting."
3,A thought provoking book...,This was a pretty good book. The authors imagery of poverty stricken London life was so realistic it hurt! The characters start out so 3 dimensional and complex... somewhere part way through the book however the details become... less. Towards the end its almost vague. I empathisized with the character's overwhelming desire to make a new place for himself free of oppression and poverty. But I had a hard time with the weak ending.
3,"It was interesting, but depressing because the characters were so self centered","I love reading about how people lived in earlier times and find inspiration in how people survived with so many fewer conveniences and support systems in place. The husband and wife in this book struggle to better their lives for their children and are successful on a financial level, but the communication between the two of them is so poor that it didn't matter how well off they were, they were still miserable. It was depressing."
4,Loved it,"This book is an amazing story, I was right their in London and then in Sydney.It always amazes me at how much hunger people endured, when we have almost unlimited everything"
4,THE SECRET RIVER,"A GOOD READ, DOES WHAT A GOOD BOOK SHOULD DO AND TAKES YOU INTO A DIFFERENT WORLD. REALLY ENJOYED THE BOOK"
3,The Secret River,"This story is in the tradition of tales that record what life in Australia was like in the distant past. Is there an industry out there mythologising what that life and people were like? I think so. Overall, it is an enjoyable and easy read with characters that became more than just names on the page to me. The setting is Australian but far removed from world and lifestyle that most people know. It'll be one of those novels that I know I've read but can't really remember."
5,Great Read!,I love historical fiction when it is well written. This story kept me intrigued. It also sparked my interest in South Wales.
3,The Secret River [Thornhill],"not sure what I expected, but it was interesting and of course I learned more about that time in history."
3,The Secret River,It was OK. Not one that I personally would recommend. This book was slow and not one I got excited about.
3,Good telling of the story of the times.,I enjoyed reading this book but found it to be a bit drug out.It did convey the hardships of the time and struggle of theWhite and black cultures.
4,Interesting and absorbing,"This was a very interesting novel with plenty of English and Australian history woven into the story. The author did and excellent job of describing life at that time in history,"
4,The Secret River,"A great writing style by Kate Grenville, with history coming to life. Enjoying the story at 70% mark and wanting to travel up the Hawkesbury to check it out. Looking forward to seeing the play at the Sydney Festival in January, and now knowing the story it will be fascinating."
4,absorbing read about the early 'settlers' of Australia,Kate Grenville has written from the angle of how it would feel to be a convict 'settling' in Australia against one's will. It is absorbing in that she describes the complexity of relocating and building another life in a new continent with limited resources. The tensions with the relationships between the 'settlers' and indigenous people gives one pause to reflect on what these relationships are like now and how they might possibly have been different.
3,Wild in New South Wales,"An interesting historical novel about the start of a ""new"" country. Once again the rich push the natives off their land - this being the Aborigine people. It is sad that the convicts of England began the destruction of a peaceful people. Life was rough for the English and they would have done better to have befriended rather than destroy."
3,It's okay,I expected more out of this book. I takes a very long time to develop the main plot. It does get better near the end.
2,Something is missing,"I have read a lot of books on my Kindle and iPad. For some of them, I wish they would never end. The Secret River could not end soon enough. Except for the facts that I paid for the book and I just do not like to quit something, I may not have finished the book. The writing did not draw me to the book. Since I am not a writer, I can not offer a learned explanation. Its seems the characters were not drawn out fully. The action was studded. The only people I cared about were the ones who were beaten down."
3,A masterpiece?? Heavens no!,"A full summation of the plot is available in other reviews. London 1806--William Thornhill, an illiterate Thames bargeman, steals a load of wood and is deported with his young family to Austrailia. Upon finishing this book my response was--""eh, that's it?"" After reading all the gushing 5 star reviews I expected more. Great idea, but the story line was too predictable, character development flat and much of the dialogue pedestrian. I came away disappionted with little new knowledge or insights about Australia or its native people. A ""masterpiece""?--heavens no!"
1,Not worth the sale price,The plot was so predictable that I didn't even bother finishing the book. The characters were not in the least big interesting.
2,The Secret River by Thornhill,It is really dreary and depressing. I am having a hard time getting through it. Didn't anyone have any fun back then.
3,Not much action,"This is basically a good book, but I am having a hard time reading it. The story moves a little slow and not a lot of action, and is somewhat predictable."
3,More of a book club study,It wasn't a page turner but an interesting story. I don't have it at the top of my recommendation list.
5,You've got to read this!,"I really liked this book. The characters were portrayed extremely well, it was a book that I couldn't put down and was sad when I finished it."
5,Captivating book,I really got into this book. I loved learning what life was like in the late 18th century and about how Australia was settled. It's amazing what those people endured.
4,so powerful,I am reading this book for the second time and I love it. I am booked to see the play in February.I can't wait. .
3,The Secret River,"This was an interesting story if you like historic backgrounds. I happen to like books which are set in an earlier time in history. I gave it three stars because I don't think it has a wide appeal to all readers. I did not learn enough about the ""savage"" population and I guess I was disappointed that they never were able to live and learn more from each other."
3,Mixed bag. Intriguing story but left me hungry for more,"Half way through this book, I would have rated it four stars.I liked learning more about life of the ""poorest of the poor"" at the turn of the 19th century. I liked the relationship hinted at and shown to some degree between Thornhill and Sal. I found life in colonial penal colony Australia very informative, since I had NO knowledge of the subject. I looked forward to continuing the story and watching these things develop.But it left me short. Thornhill's character did not grow or develop, but seemed to hop-scotch around morality. The husband-wife relationship just drug on without either a deep love or hate developing as hinted earlier. The relationship with the blacks developed more and more importance to the story, yet seemed on ""the edge"" at the same time.And finally, the fast wrap-it-all-up in a nice pretty box ending just didn't satisfy after all the build up. It disappointed me."
4,A good read,"A good read, but could have used some details of their trip to Australia.Good insight concerning the plight of the native population."
4,Early days of the Hawkesbury,A great story of the early settlements on the Hawkesbury River and Sydney town.I especially liked the interaction with the aborigines.
2,THE SECRET RIVER THORNHILL,"This book was hard to get into, but I keep reading it because I was hopeful that it would get better. I finally stopped, would not recommend this book."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"This may be the most unpleasant book I've ever stayed with to the very end. Extreme poverty, starvation, cruelty, filth. I continued to read for two reasons: (1) Australia's interesting history; and ( 2) I wanted very much for Will to find his way out of the muck to make a life for him and his family. I would not recommend this book for anyone but serious historians."
2,"The Secret River, I don't recommend",I always want something good to happen to the main characters! This book was one disaster after another and I didn't finish it.
5,Latecomer to this author,"As good as was praised in the ABC Book Club reviews.Tom Kenneally for factual research,Kate Grenville for the rest"
3,Just okay,I just did not really enjoy this book. I found if a bit boring but maybe I just chose the wrong subject.
4,Very good story on a subject I have not read before.,"Excellent book. It went on a seemingly long time, but it was all necessary to the story. It 'was informative on life in England as well as 'the new world'."
4,You'll learn about the settlement of Austrailia,"Well written, simple story. Good character development. You'll either love or hate Sal. I would recommend it to friends. It's a good beach read."
3,Interesting but story line could have been condensed,An interesting concept for a novel considering the setting but the book is too long on description and character development
3,Good read,This was an interesting story of the first convicts to be sent to Australia from England and how they survived. Not a page turner mystery but a very interesting tale.
5,Great Book!,"This is a well written story about the settling of Australia. You really care about the characters. From the first page through the last, you are hooked."
3,The Secret River,Interesting fictional historical novel and probably true for those times. People were very poor in London and were lucky to beat being executed for what we would consider minor survival eperiences. It kept me interested fromabout 40% into the novel. Would recommend it.
4,A relaxing read.,"Enjoyed this book very much. The description brought the scenery to life. I felt the strong love the couple enjoyed but along with that, they both had their disappointments and their secrets from each other. I would recommend this book."
5,Kundali Milapak in Hindu & Western system,"The Books is really written well. The author explains various things about horoscope matching as given in ancient shahtras. Also, the author has given some of the other things which are quite relevant as they explain many a things when a person relates to the other person in the previous birth. The book has dealt the matching in many ways and it gives may give insight about various phases of married life. It has also given many examples to explain the various concept adopted by Hindu as well as Western astrology."
5,A real common sense guide.,"We loved this book because it so thoroughly covered all aspects of horse housing.What we particularly liked is the author's acknowledgement that available building materials may vary in different geographical areas.Planning, Design, and Building - it took us through each step with gentle guidance helping us make our own decisions on what we could afford with time, materials and money available.It began as our 'wish' book for a new home for our 8 horses and helped us design the right facility for them."
4,My kids love this one and others by Sanger,"The pictures are very compelling. Amy's mixed-media collage style appeals to the abstract yet does a good job of representing food. They don't seem to get boring after countless reads.Moreso the writing lends itself to dramatic interpretation by the reader (me, usually) which makes them fun to read over and over. Many other authors' books become boring after a dozen or so times through and I self-select those out of the bookshelf and into the trade-in box. Not so with Hola Jalapeno.Also, we live in the land of tex-mexican food and this is a good intro to the cuisine."
4,Yummy Yummy for my Tummy...,"Another cute addition to Amy Wilson Sanger's series of book and cute as can be. Although I like this one, it's not my favorite. A few of the words are a little much for a childrens book, actually I'm stumbling saying them as this is a rhyming book and with a toddler they can't wait to get to the next page. Very cute but could have been just a drop better."
4,Good except for errors,"This is really a first class presentation just like many of the other Cracking the AP series books. It explains the BC curriculum fully and has a good assortment of practice problems, yet you will want a textbook that has similar problems so you can really build up your speed and accuracy. The only problem I saw was that there was a relatively high percentage of erroneous results in the answer pages (compared with a typical Calculus text). If you use Maple, Derive, Mathematica or even a TI-92 you can verify those answers the book doesn't agree with you on. Other than that it is very effective."
5,Underated and underappreciated,"I wish Jeff Finlin would tour the states more often. I was in Nashville last year for the Americana musicfest and discovered he played a club there but it was too late. He is one songwriter who deserves more kudos than he gets. Discovered him years ago from a Sampler Magazine call ""Leak"". This was one of the best music sampling magazines ever put out. Unfortunately like most good things in life, it folded. Angels in Diguise might be his strongest effort to date. But you can't go wrong owning any thing he has put out. Come to Cleveland Jeff."
5,A must have for your Panasonic Portable DVD Player,"You really need to buy one of these if you own a Panasonic Portable DVD Player so you don't damage the player. The players are well-built but they are inherently fragile to bouncing around, drops etc. The case is better than average quality and good looking. It fits the player perfectly and has better padding than many similar cases. There is ample room for the power supply, AV cables and a few disks, especially if you put them in paper sleeves or something smaller than a typical dvd case. TIP: Keep one DVD in the player when traveling to save storage space. I checked many sources and it's an excellent value at the price Amazon is offering."
1,OK...,"1 WHOLE GOOD SONG AND THE REST SUCK!!!!! but the song ""Jerk it Out"" is a realy good song that everyone should get on such places as Kazaa. other than that song it suckes."
2,its OK,"In short, this is a reference book and not a how to book. Not organized very well, many advanced topics are covered before more basic ones. Assumes some working knowledge and does not define all terms used."
1,too much source code,too much source code and javadoc (one third of the book!). covers many areas but superficially
5,Great reunion of articles on Well-being measurement,"This book gives you, through it's collection of well known researcher's publications, a sophisticated view on the critics and methods on well-being measurement. Indispensable to anyone studying the field."
4,A fine first novel,"Everyone in this novel seems to be going in circles in their upper class suburban Boston world. Caroline Dunlap, who has just graduated from a proper college, has come home to the world she left and finds it essentially unchanged with everyone coming quietly and oh-so-properly unglued. Everyone is looking for his or her own key to happiness, and it is as their paths cross and overlap that the pathos, humor, and sensitive writing are revealed.A good summer read."
5,TOP NOTCH,"Really, truly, and genuinely great. HAZARDS tells the story, in shifting perspective, of the rapidly unraveling Dunlaps, high-WASP New England family. Great and big cast of characters...amazing specificity...surprising momentum and build. And it's a first novel. Kind of frightening.Enjoy."
1,Save your money or gift certificate,"This book got so many five stars, I took a chance. But it was unreadable for me. I stuck with it for 40 pages and it is the kind of book I never like. A hodgepodge of introducing too many characters and I didn't care about any of them. So if you like depth of character and plot right off the bat, pass this one up. I am donating it to the library."
3,"interesting males, boring as hell females","What is it with female writers? (myself being an exception). They must have never met an interesting person of the female persuasion. The little brother, Eliot, and the father are complex, interesting characters, while the typical ""nervous breakdown"" mother and daughter Caroline are mere satellites to the ""men in their lives"". It really makes me sick to see male writers like Jonathan Franzen come up with beautifully complex portraits of women (Denise in The Corrections, Renee in Strong Motion) while every book I have read recently by a female just trots out the same silly, self-deprecating, doormat-like, joyless, self-denying, anti-hedonistic neurotic cliches in depicting their female characters and their lives."
2,You've got to be more patient than I,"I was intrigued by the setting and the good reviews but I agree with the reader who was put off by the slow plot development and large number of characters I wasn't very interested in. Everybody seemed to suffer from some nonspecific malaise, and I just didn't have the stamina to stick around and figure out what was getting everyone down -- I tried to stick with it but other books beckoned.I have to admit that, despite being a huge Henry James and Jane Austen fan, I am not a huge Cheever or Updike fan. So maybe it's me."
4,Slow but steady wins the race.,"Jessica Shattuck turns a witty eye to the world of ""old-money"" in her debut novel ""The Hazards of Good Breeding."" The Dunlop children fumble their way through growing pains as they attempt to deal with their mother's abandonment and their father's insular, puritanical behavior. A great study in character development, Shattuck also manages to infuse the story with an atmosphere of slow decay prevalent in old WASP neighborhoods. Despite its slow-pace, I enjoyed ""Hazards of Good Breeding"" for its sharp-focus details and unexpected plot-twists, which kept me entertained throughout. Worth the wait!"
1,Disappointing,"It has been a long time since I read a book by a major publisher so filled with cliches, so obvious in its character and plot development. The heroine of the novel is not given any significant flaws and as a result is unearthly, inhuman, and the rest of the characters are rough-hewn caricatures. Various typos throughout the book--and to say that a character who goes to school in Cambridge, MA wouldn't know Brigham's ice cream is ridiculous (especially from an author who should know better). Sloppy in too many places."
2,I didn't buy this book but paid (lots) in time spent reading,"I had not read any reviews about this work, I admit choosing it as I was attracted by the title. For me this book failed as the author told me things about this world she created and did not show through narrative and character development for me to be able to come to my own conclusions. I felt like she was ""teaching girls"" in the very worst way. Giving the answers instead of providing the facts and clues to understand on your own. It was dog-dead boring and slow in parts, and I found the sheer number of typos unacceptable. If the author is to write more I hope her publisher treats her work with the respect any published work deserves. To adhere to my family's admonition, ""if you can't say anything good, don't say anything at all"" she made me curious and I spent quite a bit of time reading ""manifold theory"" and am inspired to register for a higher math class."
1,Snoozefest,"This book was so boring, I forced myself to read half of it before I just could not go on. I did not care one ounce for the characters. I was hoping something horrible like a nuclear attack or that their town would catch leaprosy just to make it interesting. I figured out the ""surprise"" instantly. (I flipped through the last chapter just to see if I was correct.) BORING book."
1,"Diisappointing - Boring, Pathetic, and Utterly Forgettable","I love post apocalyptic sci-fi movies. Since I am partial to that breed of movie I am willing to forgive a lot. But this movie fails in just about every way a movie can fail. The story is weak, the acting is weak....EVERYTHING is weak. Some movies are so bad (e.g. Plan 9 From Outer Space) that they are entertaining as comedies. Not so here. Just really bad. I found myself thinking about WORK while watching this. That is how gripping it is. Imagine a bunch of high school film students made a budget movie for their class project. Well, here it is. I am gonna take this one to 1/2 Price Books asap."
2,Bad Movie.......Great T.V. Show,"Title really says it all. If you get this "" Movie "" and expect a fun exciting ride you will not be happy. If you get this to see a good T.V. show well than hell good grab."
3,"Mediocre copy of ""Children of Men""","Lame ripoff of several post apocalypse stories. I saw elements of ""Children of Men"", ""Mad Max"", and ""The Day After"", along with a bunch of forgettable copycat movies usually seen at 2AM on TV, or in the $5 bin at Walmart. It could've been done much better, but it didn't seem like anybody really had their heart in making it."
2,"Well, be nice.....silly!",I really need to become a science-fiction writer...wondering if they will accept an old critic??
2,AMERICA'S CRITIC,"ANOTHER FLOPPPPPPERRRRR, I ACUALLY LIKE THESE ACTORS JUST A LOWLOWLOW BUDGET FILM PLOT WAS A BUMMMER LOL,,, RECCOMEND TO MOVE TO ANOTHER FILM TO ENTERTAIN YOURSELF WITH KEEP LOOKING. NOT WITH THIS ONE."
1,Only redeeming feature is the song,"Zillions of logical flaws--people are way too clean, trimmed, and civil. Mostly, they're just too plump--are supplies running low or not? Was there or was there not a nuclear cataclysm so great that it totally destroyed society and blighted agriculture, and if so...?As the other reviewers have said, ""Post-Apocalyptic"" nearly requires the adjective ""bad"". This is even worse than that. In addition to an absolutely nonsensical plot thread (and associated stock caricatures--insane sisters/adopted daughters of ""wicked witch"")we also have actual fairyland style magic with a psycho-mystic twist courtesy of a cheesy Black ""shaman"". Imagine Lionel Richie blathering platitudes in Morgan Freeman's very blandest voice.And for all that, Tara Nevins' rendition of ""Stars Fell on Alabama"" is worth the rental."
1,"I wish I could like it, but I can't!!","Too difficult to explain how bad it is. I bought it in spite of the bad reviews because my taste in movies is so different from other people, but I have to say they were right. I should have listened. The only bright side is that I bought the cheapest used copy I could find."
1,end of the world flop,"I should have known better after reading the back of this DVD I rented at Blockbuster than to rent it. My hopes that I would be wrong were dashed when I found out this movie is just another poor attempt by bankrupt movie makers to cash in on popular box office hits. Dedicated end-of-times enthusiasts may take this poorly written prediction of the future to heart but, of course, some people will believe anything. Low budget movies like this have the advantage of being filmed in a junk yard."
1,Save Your Money,"This movie was a complete dud...can I have my $ and hour of wasted viewing time back? Snoozeville of a story line and, totally unrealistic."
5,Best aerobatic book,"I have about 10 books on aerobatics. This is far and away the best, and the only one I keep re-reading and studying. Excellent, in-depth discussions. You won't be disappointed."
4,A sweet look into one ofthe world's relatively undiscovered genre,"""Songs of a Friend"" is both fantastically written and translated. One of the relatively undiscovered treasures from the late Middle Ages in Portugal, it serves as a looking glass into the literature and political climite of the time, esp. during the reign of Dom Dinis. Very much worth the investment for the better picture of troubadour Europe."
3,Not what I expected,First it took over 3 weeks to arrive and then it looked nothing like the picture. I just have big blocks (cheese wedge shaped) of the coating.
2,Not good,"Although i like the sound of the 80s this is no music to listen to...Only a few days ago i heard the neverending story song on the local network and rememberd my childhood days when i first saw the movie on one beautiful Christmas eve (i think 'twas 1988).The song always echoed in my head but i couldn't find out who sang it...until few days ago.The first thing i did was start my computer and go online to see what the band was about...boy was i disappointed!The neverending story is the only song that's any good,the rest is just junk!If you're into the 80s i recommend bands like Simple Minds,Dire Straits,U2,Queen...Kajagoogoo is a total miss! And what does kajagoogoo mean anyway??Are those Limahl's first baby words???"
4,Ever gone to rent a movie and wondered what to rent?,"If so, this book will solve your problem pronto. It just might be the best general guide to movies I have ever seen. I doesn't cover EVERY movie ever made like some review books do, but it covers the cream of the crop for every year from 1927 to 1998. Granted, some of the more recent reviews are a little questionable, and some gems might have been missed (they can't please everyone). But overall this movie is a great way to find a movie that you might like to rent or buy that you have overlooked.The descriptions are short, but give a good general idea what to expect. As another reviewer mentioned, movie MPAA ratings are missing, which is a minor inconvenience to the family oriented or morally selective. Finally, this movie book contains some REALLY cool pictures from classic movies, some of which you won't find in the actual movie because of the aspect ratio. So there you have it, my favorite movie book, and a bargain at any price."
1,Brian Evans is better.,"Unfortunately, the politics of the industry avoid the real talent. This album is produced well, but that's because David Foster is who he is. The tracks sound all the same, and no song has power or range."
1,Well...,"I've never actually heard the whole cd. It really doesn't matter either seeing as I've heard most of it from other artists and enjoyed it more then. This guy won't be remembered for sure. There's nothing phenomenal about someone doing covers of other people's materials. Buble isn't the only one that does is it though. You hear an old song, and you want to find out who originally does it, but that's impossible seeing how back in the old days, they all just did each other's songs. Frankly, I'm not a big fan of this sort of music, I think it's quite annoying, but I do enjoy some of the artists. And Michael Buble is not at all making a new generation appreciate the old. How dumb and naive is that? When a teenaged girl opens up her 5 disc CD player and puts in Frank Sinatra next to Michael Buble, 50 Cent, Van Morrison, and Akon and sits back to gaze at the posters of J-Lo, Dean Martin, and The Backstreet Boys, then we'll talk.."
2,Not too bad but can be better,"Michael Buble has a very good vioce. If he can only put a little more heart into the songs. He failed to bring out the emotions in each of the songs. Overall, not too bad for a first timer."
1,Another [poser],"Why would I buy this album, full of Frank Sinatra covers, by some guy who sings no better than a million other lounge acts?If I want to hear ""Come Fly With Me,"" then who sings it better than Sinatra?David Foster is obviously losing his grip, and his inability to produce anything recent that is relevant has produced this desperate attempt at another [poser].The CD is tacky."
1,This album is not worth the money.,"The problem with this CD is that it wreaks of ego, and yet no substance.The voice is the same as any other I've ever heard, but has been produced by a fellow Canadian, and a label that needs to make it's money back by placing it on soundtracks, desperate to get their investment back.The songs of boring, boring, boring."
5,"""Michael Buble""","I would go to a Michael Buble"" concert in a flash, he is a fresh new innovative voice in the swing Jazz genra, he gives Romance back to the songs he sings, I hope we hear a lot more from him, his work in the Wedding Date"" was superb."
4,Pretty Good,"I really enjoyed this c.d. Michael Buble does a nice job with most of these songs and has a very melodic voice. I can't help but feel, however, that there are abut a million people out there who can sing just as well. I still think this c.d. is worth owning though. He does a nice job."
5,I Love His Moondance!!!,I think Michael Buble has the potential to be the next big thing. He's got a terrific voice with so much energy. This CD is classic and smooth. Michael is a breath of fresh air compared to some of his contemporaries. I'm looking forward to his next CD.
5,What a Beautiful Voice!,"I just ordered this CD after only hearing parts of it. The voice is absolutely beautiful. All of the songs that I have heard are done beautifully, especially ""Summer Wind"" and ""You'll Never Find"", but his version of the Bee Gees ""How Can you Mend a Broken Heart"" is the best one I have heard, with the exception of the Bee Gees version. The fact that the guys join in on this version makes even more special.If you want to hear a great voice (better than Sinatra) sing some beautiful standards you have to get his CD."
5,Something for every age,I saw him live in concert and HE was SOOOO GREAT... a smooth sound of songs from years ago... a great buy and great for any age!!! A forsure must!
5,Reminds me of Sinatra,Buble has a great voice and the songs he sings and the style he follows put in the mind of the great Frank Sinatra. Good job Michael.
5,Smooth as Silk,"A pure combination of Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra with a mix of Nat King Cole. Very enjoyable to listen too. Smooth as silk voice, excellant passion, well worth the purchase."
5,Outstanding,"'Enhanced' is an excellent title for this CD. Buble enhances music that cuts across three decades and updates them with a new sound.Michael Buble could be the one who brings back swing and big band and he revives the love song. His voice is clear and fresh. He breathes new life into tunes of yesteryear and even does a better job on many of them compared to the originals.I heard this CD at a friends house, my wife and I love it. This is romantic, lilting music that will inspire you. I would not say that Buble is better than Sinatra, yet there is no comparing Buble's singing talent to anyone else. His rendition of Kissing a Fool was excellent.""For Once in My Life,"" he sings that with full lung capacity and makes it very snappy. ""Come Fly With Me,"" is really a kick, upbeat and perky. I really like his rendition to ""Put Your Head on My Shoulder.""This is a tribute to the time when music and America were great. This is going to be a gift I give to many of my friends over the next few months."
2,"Swings, but too high","Buble's take on swing is Frank Sinatra by way of Wayne Newton. The voice is tremendous, but he can't seem to hold on to the intimacy; he starts out slow and low, but then the music takes on a hard-edged, brassy sound that never fails to remind me of Vegas, for some reason. Too showy."
2,please listen with your EARS!,"I bought this CD impulsively after sampling a few tracks at a listening station at Barnes and Nobles. In the mood for a new CD or singer, I bought it. My first reaction was ""WOW! How come I never heard of this guy?"" After listening to the whole thing at home, I thought ""Hmm not bad"" Upon a few more listenings my opinion has fallen to ""YAWN! Another overly hyped wanna-be"" Truly great singers of standards offer so much more depth than this guy can deliver. You can listen to the truly greats over and over and over and they never grow tired, and most actually improve over the test of time. Trust me, this guy won't be one of them. He is merely mimicking the style, not offering it up with credibility. Diana Krall? THERE is the real thing. Listen to Sinatra right after little Michael and you will hear it- IF that is, you are listening with your EARS."
5,Bring on more Mr. Bublé!,After watching and loving his DVD I knew his album would be fantastic. It is!!!!
3,Ahh he sound like a 30's singer that's all,"He didn't ring my bell, He is very talented but as a Blues and Jazz lover he did not turn me onSorry Michael"
5,Buble should be the magical voice of Christmas,Buble is today's Bing Crosby of Christmas. My grown up list has to be heard to be believed. In front of the fireplace and at your holiday dinner this cd is a must have.
5,A Great Talent,"It is so unusual these days to find a talent who can sing recognizable songs and old standards with a fresh twist. Michael Buble makes all the songs on this album his own. Even those that I dreaded to hear are absolutely wonderful.A fresh face, a fresh voice, a fresh talent who is certainly going to be around for a very long time."
3,Pretty good,"I like it, but not quite as much as I expected. It's worth buying, but wait for a discount if you can."
3,problems paying cd,content of michael buble cd is fine. problem is that it will not play on my computers cd drive. will play on a boom box and traditional cd player. what gives?
5,Buble' Can Fly With Me ANYTIME!,"Who Is THAT??? My head turned when I heard this voice, Who is he? All right Foster, you've done it AGAIN. This guy has a penchant for finding the best of the best and he's scored once more with Michael Buble'! This guy swings so high you think you might never come down, as for me, I didn't WANT TO! Great presence, phrasing is perfection, pitch, there's nothing this young man lacks. As a professional Jazz vocalist (A Working One!)I am smitten with this wonderful new talent. Mr. Foster, I MUST thank you for bringing us yet another genious that makes my ears smile!"
5,At Long Last,"For the past few years there has been a number of female (pop/jazz) singers that have hit the scene, such as Dina Krall, Jane Monheit, Casandra Wilson and Norah Jones but really no male singers. At long last you can now put away your Tonny Bennet, Bobby Darin, Frank Sinatra, Mel Torme recordings. This is a break out CD for Micheal Buble'who is bond to be a force in pop/jazz singing for years to come. He swings like Bobby Darin and croons like Sinatra, but yet he has enough of his own style and sound in that he is not just trying to copying them.He along with Peter Cincotti are two new exciting male singers who are ""musts"" to have in your CD collection. I rate this a a strong 5 star rating."
5,American Idol led me to him,Did you catch American Idol's first night? Well if you did you heard judge Randy Jackson praise Michael Buble.I now have Michael Buble's stunning cd in my cdplayer.Judge Jackson - thank you for introducing me to a major talent!
3,"Pleasant, but not worth the hype","""They"" tell us that Buble is the next great pop interpreter. Maybe. But there is little evidence of it here. He is good, and has a good voice, but you've heard it all before. He sounds like a replay of Harry Connick, with a little Darin tossed in and echoes of Sinatra. Of course, Connick was himself accused of being too derivative of Sinatra. So the question here becomes--what's new? The answer--nothing. It's pleasant elevator music in the style of the aforementioned guys, well done for its type, but lacking anything distinctive or truly artistic. Sinatra, one might remember, was an innovator in many ways. Let's see Buble do something to make his mark, not just mimic others...."
5,The Best Talent Yet,"This is one of the best albums ever. It's so rare that you find a young singer that masters the sounds of the past. Rather than be wrapped up in a lot of different genre's that isn't really all that great, he serenades his listeners with the sounds of yesterday and to be honest, without yesterday there is no today. He doesn't become cliche and that is definite staying power in my music collection. I have all albums ever created by him and I'm happy I heard his music. I can't wait until he does another concert so that I may be the first in line to hear him. (I will sleep outside the ticket booth to get the best tickets. Crazy but anything for REAL talent!!!) Anyone still not so sure about his music, take it from a twenty three year old: BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!!!!"
5,Michael Buble-Christmas,"I would be shocked to hear a CD by this man that I didn't love...his style, his voice, his deliverance of each song..then put that to Christmas music....it doesn't get any better!"
3,""" That's All ""","Best track of this CD is "" That's All "" , thanks to brilliant Johnny Mandel's arrangement ! Wish he'd arranged the whole CD !"
1,A horrible new big band singer has arrived...,"Lounge lounge and more lounge, this music might be enjoyed at a smokey bar in Vegas, but on cd, it doesn't sound unique, another Harry Connick(we only need one!!!). And now we have 3 Connick;s with Cincotti!!!"
1,A Yawn,"Odd how artists catch on, such an example is Michael Buble. His voice is pleasant, like a lounge singer in an upscale hotel or perhaps Vegas. Yes, Vegas baby! Some of his covers are decent, especially ""Fever"", but please Mr. Buble do NOT attempt to cover Van Morrison. As Bob Geldorf said in a tribute to Van, ""How many murdered ""Moondances"" have we heard?"" We just heard another one. Too much almost Frank, and not quite enough Harry Connick Jr., Mr. Buble's creamy, dreamy, overblown voice is dangerous to your health especially while driving. A yawn."
1,Notes Without Substance,"Sure! With enough promotion he will sell some CD's but there ismuch lacking in these performances such as musicality, phrasing,feeling and other nuances that you find in a Nat Cole performance. What's left here is an empty suit or rather, anempty voice. Why waste money on this CD when you can buy thereal thing by Cole or Sinatra that will give you pleaure forever..."
5,"Michael Bublé "" THE BEST""","Tony Good, Dean Better, Micheal the Best. Yes Bublé is Amazing, Michael you are by far the real thing. It's a Frank Sinatra with a voice, it's magic.. The Best CD ever, get this CD."
1,Cheesy lounge lizard,"This CD is just plain horrible. If you want to hear real talent listen to the original artists on most of these tracks. Most notable George Michael's ""Kissing A Fool"". Buble does not do any of these tracks justice. A travesty."
1,A waste of time,"This guy doesn't even have a good voice...and this album is on Warner? No, actually it's not. It's on 143 Records, distributed by Warner Brothers. For some reason, the CD jacket states Buble is 25, and he's 30.When will music speak for itself again, instead of all of this non-sense?The album is a waste of my time, and yours. Anyone of us could have jumped into the studio, and if this guy is the next Sinatra, as his handlers call him, then I'm Sammy Davis.And I'll bet Buble doesn't even know who he is.This album smells of unfounded ego, and after seeing the guy on the TODAY SHOW, it has become increasingly obvious that we all must still await the best of them to come, because this guy isn't it.Maybe I'll catch him at the karaoke bar, because there are far better singers there on a Monday night."
1,Please.,"I bought the record, and I returned the record.Since when is ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"" a Sinatra styled song?Shame on Warner Brothers for milking the legacy of a dead artist to start out the career of someone who couldn't hold Sinatra's cup of coffee.Way out of line."
1,Yuk!,I just watched this guy on Ellen and he sucks. I don't care for his music at all. Thank goodness I didn't waste my money on his CD.
2,a jazz newbie's experience,"As a caveat, I should say this is the first Michael Buble album I've listened to and I haven't listened to any of this kind of music recreationaly (any kinds of jazz) but wanted to give it a try by listening to one of the top selling artists in this music category. Another caveat, I only listened to the first 3 songs then gave up. This sounds like music my grandparents would make love to."
3,60/40,"Michaels big band sound is the style he should stick to. Putting big band sound to How can you mend a broken heart, Put your head on my shoulders, Moondance(Van Morrisson owns this one), and especially crazy little thing called love dosen't work!! On the positive side I'll enjoy a martini coctail while listening to his beautiful sound for Fever, The way you look tonight, Come fly with me, and That's all."
5,"Spectacular Singer, Spectacular CD","If you love the sound of a true pure crooning voice Bublé is that man..........Thrilling discovery for all of us who love the kind of music where words and lyrics do indeed have meaning.In a way that I can only describe as sensual, Bublé powerfully sings his way through this spectacular cd. I couldn't say that I enjoyed one song any more than another, for as you will hear, each is unique, and each one is so artfully orchestrated and sung that picking any one 'best' would be impossible.I rate this cd as the best one I've ever heard, and so will you!"
5,This is how to make music!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10 star album ***,Now this is how to make beautiful music!!Seldom does a singer appeal to music lovers across the globe but Michael Buble is one who does.I loved every track on this well produced album by David Foster.
4,Simply a pleasure to listen to,"While in New York recently, a helpful salesperson at Colny Records recormended this recording and he was right on the mark. Michael Buble has Sinatra's flair, William's good looks and Harry Connick Jr's showmanship. It is not often that I praise male vocalists, personally I like the female torch/cabaret singers like Linda Eder, Karen Akers, Connie Champagne and Sharon McNight but Buble's CD is hauntingly beautiful and a must have for your listening pleasure. And get it here on AMAZON.com, I paid $$ more for it at Colony but hey, its Colony Music and it is New Yor City...plus, I never would have gotten the recommendation. ENJOY!"
5,At Long Last A New Crooner to carry the torch of the greats.,Sinatra WAS my only musical love.Michael Buble has now earned that special place in my heart. Long live the New King of Swing!For weeks now the Michael Buble disc has been in constant rotation both at my home and in my office. My office now consists of Michael Buble's newest and best fans. We love him in Michigan!
5,This is real good - a listener's treat - a 10 star rating!,"I love this album. Every note, every song.It has inspired me to learn more about music because I find that I'm uplifted after listening to it.Thank you Michael, wish you all the best from Calgary"
5,"Michael Buble's voice is silk, satin, and velvet!","Memories of the past are better than the real thing!! Michael Buble is reminiscent of the good old days when songs had melodies, sighed of romance, and had understandable words.TheGod-given velvet voice of a very handsome young Canadian brings the charisma of Frank Sinatra to the new millenium of youngsters who never knew Frank, and to oldsters who swooned and danced to the cool jazz/pop sounds during their youth. Easily the best new talent in his genre, Michael Buble was a recent rage on the Today Show before his European Tour. Ears will be delighted with his soothing sounds!"
4,Music by Michael Buble,"The wife likes only one song, but she is the one who wantedThe shipping was on time and no unexpected charges"
3,Question for reviewers,Michael Buble' did a live performance on either Jay leno or David Letterman and he performed a version of 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' that is not on his debut album. Does anyone know where I can get that version?He performed live piano and the version had more of a pop/ r&b; appeal and it was performed as a ballad instead of an uptempo.kansgroove@hotmail.com
1,No no no,"The trouble is, I DO get it with ""Bubble"". I'm a former musician, and I have to say that in LA alone, there are hundreds of folks with voices BETTER than Bubble's.But I DO get it.He's a triumph of marketing, and his handlers, label and marketers clearly know his audience. In that respect, he's no different than any of the other transparently marketed, lukewarm ""talent"" out there. Take your pick - I'm sure any of the top 50 (or more) pop artists can ""carry a tune.""Now, I'm watching this kid try and instigate banter on his PBS show, talking to the camera, and it is pathetically forced, and quite frankly, he comes off as canned in the least. Sorry, but Bubble is whitebread and mayo on top of it all."
2,Michael Buble - Michael Buble,"I am glad I purchased the Michael Buble - It's Time CD before this one, because if I had not, I never would have bothered. The difference between the self titled and It's Time is striking. In a word, this CD is tired. The song selections, while classic, have been over covered. Michael's delivery was flat. No, that understates it. It is like a zombie recorded this CD- a total absence of passion. Do yourself a favor and skip this one and go right for It's Time. While it too has some over covered songs, they are far less than on this CD and no one can say the delivery on It's Time is anything but passionate."
3,Bad Packing,"A heavy liquid products shipped with the 2 CD's caused a break to one of the CD covers, but no damage to the actual CD. Items should have been shipped separately or packed correctly.Bad Supervision on the final packing and shipment."
4,Another hit by Buble,"I actually only purchased this CD for the song 'Everything', but found that the entire CD has some really great tracks on it. If your a fan of Mr. Buble, then this needs to be added to your collection!"
3,My wife just loves him,"I saw his special on television. He has the sound like ""Old Blus Eyes"" and Harry C."
5,Impressed!!!!!!!!,I have to say that I was very impressed and surprised at the caliber of this young man's voice. For a lad so young he has the sound of someone who has been singing for a decade. He brings to life each and every song with his own special touch. I feel that he is at the beginning of a wonderful and long career. I will be looking forward to anything that this artist puts out. I only hope that he stays with this wonderful style of music and brings us another c.d. as wonderful of this one
4,New face of jazz,"Michael Buble marks his entrance into the music world with his self-titled freshman album. After only one listen, any listener will know Buble is an up-and-coming singer who has talent to spare.He covers many well-known songs in the album which he performs with the vigor and energy expected of these classics. He does a pretty good good considering he is singing songs of such greats as Sinatra, Bobby Darin and Dean Martin. This is to his credit although it would be nice to see Buble take a bigger risk on his next album and not go with songs that are so widely popular.Overall, a good album but let's hope his next one will be more adventurous in his repetoire."
5,the music world just got better,Michael Buble just raised the bar in the world of enjoyable music. Impressive vocal skill with a balanced big band sound.Refreshingly different.
5,My favorite CD,"His voice makes me ""sway"". A true musician - very classy. Even my 3 kids age 8 to 13 sing a long. Great tunes to de-stress."
5,"Ooh, la-la","Excellent and well produced, this is a great cd. When Michael Buble is compared with Sinatra, it is more than true. All the tracks on this cd are fun, not a sour note anywhere. I stumbled on it by going to the Reprise Records site after a Neil Young and Crazy Horse concert (I bought Greendale too.) If you like swing, you will love this album."
5,Totally Romantic,"I know I'm a bit behind buying this album now when its been out for a few years, but I own the two newest albums and LOVE them. I have to say that this album did not disappoint me one bit. I think I like it even more than his most recent albums. The songs are so romantic and sexy. If you are a Michael Buble fan and don't have this one yet, do yourself a big favor and buy it!"
5,Michael Buble is a gem,"Michael Buble has an amazing, rare talent. His voice is so smooth and beautiful you can't help but fall in love. He also does a wonderful job in his covers of classic oldies. He is a must-have in everyones music collection."
5,Maaaaaaaaaaaarvelous!,"Wow. This guy can really sing, not just pretend to. As a college student, there's no way I can have this CD on while studying--I end up singing along or just closing my eyes and listening. Much recommended tracks--""Fever"" (my favorite) and ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love."" Marvelous CD!"
5,Very Enjoyable,"Like the late greats, this gentleman has the tone and delivery that is so appealing and easy on the ears.I am very impressed with the song choices and the way in which Bublé leaves his own unique signature on each one - I mean, come on he covers everything from Queen to Sinatra and it works!"
5,A Tribute,"Buble's record is an outstanding tribute to a style and time of music that Manlow and others have tried to duplicate. He makes the grade! It is wonderful to hear a young singer doing some old (really old) standards of my time. We wanted to dance, immeidately! I hope he works his way through the entire ""genre."" If you like ""Big Band"" and clean, solid, solo vocals you have to sample Buble!"
4,"very pleasant to listen to, nice mix of different flavors.","Frank, Billie, Ella, Sarah, Carmen, Joe and other greats are no longer here. When young and new artists touch on the very songs that musical legends made famous, they never have intentions tocompare with what 's been recognized as a definitive recording of a song. But when a song has endured the test of time and proven its virtue, it belongs to everyone , including young singers.This album offers a very pleasant listen that goes with any occasions.The new life breathed into such songs as ""Put Your Head.."" and ""You'll Never Find"" with new arrangements reflect the spirits of the songs, arrangers and the singers. This album is not about the singer alone -but several characteristics combined. Of course, we still enjoy Frank and Louis and Ella but we shouldn't keep the door shut when younger generations want to come in."
5,Check out his Caught In The Act concert CD/DVD,"I went to Buble's concert couple of weeks ago. Man, his voice is amazing. You just haven't heard him if you never hear him live. This CD good as it is, doesn't do him justice at all. It's good there is concert DVD - Caught In The Act, which is as close as you can get for some taste of his live performance."
4,Exciting new singer!,"Michael Buble exhibits extroardinary talent and is to be applauded for reviving the beautiful romantic songs of the great crooners such as Sinatra and Martin. His voice can sound as soft as rose petals one moment and as strong as a hurricane the next. This CD is a breath of fresh air and I can only see his talent broadening as he matures. The song ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"" with Barry Gibb singing backup vocals actually made me cry, it was so poignant. You won't be disappointed. This is a great CD."
5,Michael Buble,This CD is fantastic! I loved it so much I bought one for my 78 eight year old mother who thinks he's even better than Frank Sinatra. I especially love his version of Moondance and Fever. I would highly recommend this CD
4,A surprisingly good albumn,"I was familiar with Michael, but did not realize how much I really enjoyed his talent until purchasing this CD. He offers a unique perspective, style, and sound in today's pop music culture."
2,"imitative and shallow, but promising","I first heard cuts from this album while shopping at a bookstore, specifically ""Come Fly With Me"" and ""The Way You Look Tonight."" My opinion was and is that he has a good voice, excellent pitch and an obvious affection for the genre, but there was a lack of convicition and style a la Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.I'm disappointed with most of the rest, especially ""Crazy Little Thing"" because of the echoplex or reverb. If he's just going to be imitative, why bother? Why not do something different? He's got a good voice and a capable backup band...I think that may be the fault of producer David Foster, who took the group Chicago from innovative to syrupy in a very short time.I'm not happy at spending $20 and getting so little for my money (which I spent based on exposure to two of the best cuts). However, He's got potential, and I look forward to having someone to help erase my memory of Sinatra's pitch problems."
5,you've got to listen to this boy,"Was impressed, this is a great cd. I would recommend this cd to anyone who loves the greats of the swing/big band era. Buble has super voice and the song choices cover 40 years of good music with a modern feel. Wonderful."
5,Fantastic!,I ordered this CD after I saw and heard him on the Today Show. The CD is no disappointment. I hope to hear he'll be on tour soon.
5,"The Real Rebirth of ""Lounge Music""","In the wake of all of the re-issues of 50's and 60's so-called ""lounge music"" comes a disc that really does live up to this musical classification. Michael Bublé's incredibly agile vocals and smooth delivery recall the golden years of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. The performer, however, is not another copy cat artist; he has style, individuality, and a voice that defines the terms ""polish"" and ""sophistication."" Do you relish Nelson Riddle's classic orchestrations? Then get ready for a unique treat! The instrumental arrangements are nothing short of breathtaking. Buy this disc at once, and I guarantee that it will be locked in place on your CD player for months. These vocal stylings and performances blow Harry Connick out of the water!!"
5,I lkie it,"As usual, his voice is so smooth and calm, and the price of the CD is so cheap, can't beat the price"
5,This CD was wonderful!,I absolutely love Michael Buble's voice and this is one of my 2 favorites along with Crazy Love. He has an absolutely heart melting voice that works well with his song choice for this cd. Great blues music. I highly recomend.
5,Great covers of classic standards,"Michael Buble chooses a wonderful mix of standards to cover with a smooth crooner's voice that has a sound all its own. The level of emotion he puts into songs, be they slow, fast, sad, or happy makes him one of my favorite vocal artists. If you want a set of classic songs to relax and tap your foot to (and maybe even add your own voice to), you will not be disappointed with this collection by Michael Buble."
3,"Smart selection of songs, creditable producer lists.","For those who is truly a veteran music fan of Classical/Swing like Steven Langley Guy can skip this CD.For those who don't really listen to Jazz/Classical but enjoy a little popular tunes by Diana Krall, Josh Groban etc will play this to sleep.For those who first invest in this kind of music Michael Bublé is a good start so you'd continue to discover more experienced performers (some of them appeared behind the credit of the songs on this CD).Bublé is not only a pretty face but he does have a good Karaoke voice, and I like to see new names in my CD racks so I purchased this debut album. My favourite track is PUT YOUR HEAD ON MY SHOULDER, call me crazy but I think it sounds better than Paul Anka. Sorry, executive producer.And MOONDANCE of course, a brand new uplifting listening to a Van Morrison's remake.Nevertheless this is a commercially successful album, boasting a smart selection of songs with creditable producer lists."
2,Sounds a lot like Frank...........,"Yeah, I too, have to agree, that this guy is a good singer- good at imitating Frank Sinatra. He doesnt have his own voice.Nora Jones has her own voice. Dolly Parton has her own voice. Randy Travis has his own voice. Not this guy. These songs have a very schmaltzy feel to them. But, I must say it is relaxing. The guy does have talent. But I would like to hear him try something that is a reflection of his own personality."
1,Boy is this generic.,"Does he have a pleasant voice? Sure. But while Mr. Buble can carry a tune, he is completely void of any CHARACTER! What made Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. etc so popular is that they performed these songs with thier own style. Each sounded different from the others without stepping on anybody elses toes. Michael Buble gives sterile, boring renditions of these timelss classics. On ""Nice and Easy"" he's anything but. Good lord boy, stop trying to crisply enunciate every single syllable! It's nice and easy, sing it that way. If you've never spent any time listening to these classics, it's an ok starter album, but I would bet that any long tiime Sinatra listener won't give this much of a listen. If the Josh Groban sheep think that this is torch music, that's a sad state of music knowledge these days. Do yourself a favor and buy ""In the Wee Small Hours"" and hear a true master at work, one who sings from his heart and not from a production board."
5,Excellent CD,"If you enjoy listening to the ""crooners"" - Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Perry Como, etc. - you will enjoy this present-day voice. An excellent gift choice for those who listened to the crooners when the crooners were the present-day voices, or for those who like the music. I was delighted to discover this artist."
5,Michael Buble',"I Love Michael's voice, Loved ""Sway"" and most of the other songs.He's soooooooo cute. A must have!"
2,Want swing? Look elsewhere...,"It's amazing to me that so many people are ranting and raving about this album. What a bizarre creation it is. Not only is the choice of tunes competely erratic, but the band and singer are so stiff, that it makes you feel tense. Sure, the band is comprised of a bunch of hot shots and fantastic players, but put them all together, and you have a bunch of egos fighting to be heard. As for Mr. Buble, lighten up and swing, man...you and your band need to have a martini or two..."
1,Not a chance,"This guy is another wannabe, and the music sounds like karaoke tracks at best. If you want to hear a real crooner, check out Peter Cincotti or Brian Evans. Those are the guys who you can feel have a passion for it. So let this guy ride the wave a little, because the others will rise to the top. As they say, the best are saved for last, and the overly promoted...well they just end up there.The song ""Fever"" on this album is just terrible. I suggest you list to the sound clips and here it for yourself."
2,A poor imitation.......,"I was very eager to hear this CD, but was very disappointed. Michael Buble does nothing new for these songs. It was like listening to a karaoke singer in a bar do these songs. I love this style of music, and would really look forward to NEW songs in this style being written and recorded by Michael Buble, but to do nothing more than sing the songs in the same style as the original doesn't warrant shelling out your hard earned bucks. I have my Sinatra, Sammmy, and Dean CD's, and if you have any of their CD's, skip this one. It's nothing more than a poor imitation."
2,Good choice of music but average voice,"As avid ballroom dancer I am addicted to old band music. The selection is fabulous, but the voice is obviously flat and average. Ok for bar entertainment only."
2,Celtic Music,To much rain and it kept distorting the music. I was not really happy with this CD. They should have had it more of a gentle rain instead of heavy.
1,bad BAD B-A-D,"I've ordered the collection with one thought in mind: ohh boy! a good irish collection.i was astonished to hear SYNTHESIZED(!) music instead of the real instruments - no violins here, no bagpipes, no flutes!only synthesized music! this collection had much potential but it was killed!not to mention the annoying rain sounds. ok - their nice for starts but they dont stop all thru the album and sometimes the music gets engulfed in them totaly.BAD!"
2,Enough rain already!!,"The music on this CD is simple but varied, from Irish jigs to some ballads. But every piece has the sound of rain in the background... every piece, all the way through. I come from a climate with a lot of rain (not Ireland), but even a desert-dweller would get the idea after a couple of pieces in background, and an interlude or two. It made me glad when the last piece was finished. This one was fine for a single listening, but no more than that for me."
2,dummy and wrong?,"I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys crafts and modeling, or just to everybody who is curios about the making of things, because this book contains ready-to-use printable and editable (look for the cd-rom) patterns for the most used types of packaging on the market.Be aware that this book is just a collection, a dummy, with no explanations.But unfortunately, all the examples I have printed directly from the source files were somehow misfit and ended to be weird useless objects (stuff for 'The Design of Everyday Things' by Donald A. Norman, if you like).I am not sure if this problem is in my copy of the book (an 'errata corrige'?), I hope that you'll be more lucky than me.To all design students I would recommend this book, instead: 'The Packaging Designer's Book of Patterns' by Lazlo Roth, George L. Wybenga"
4,Good reference material.,This book does not have information on the principles of package design. It's main purpose is to provide diagrams of 100's of packages. It is good reference material for those wanting to see how to lay out a package template and includes a CD of the templates. It is a valuable tool for those that do a lot of package design.
4,Useful for Graphic Designer,"It is very useful, it have a CD with different files of model of package. You can use it how example and you can understand the structure of each one."
5,thank you,"I bought some for my 86 year old aunt who has severe sinus/post nasal drip/allergy. It gets so bad it keeps her up sometimes with the coughing and exhausts her. She uses so many medications trying to get some relief, plus the Neti Pot plus an electric irrigation system, plus ginger and thyme tea and Vicks. Since her health is otherwise good, I do what I can just to make sure she stays healthy and is as comfortable as can be.She has been drinking the tea for a week now and says it is defintiely helping. Thank you! Anything I can do to keep her alive and comfortable is a good thing. She also says it tastes pretty good. And I like that it's not another medication to have in her body but is all natural. She likes drinking tea very day anyway and it's nice to be able to help her feel better."
5,Miracle tea,"I am amazed at this tea. I was miserable for 3 1/2 months with a lung infection after quitting smoking. The prescription medicines I used didn't ease the misery of this at all, so I ordered this tea hoping for some relief. After using this tea for one day, I had dramatic results; no more sore, irritated lungs; less congestion; better mood!!! Wish I had tried this 3 1/2 months ago. From now on, this tea will be in my cabinet; I won't be without it again! I am stunned that an herbal tea works better than the meds my doctor prescribed."
5,It works!,"I was pretty skeptical that this tea could actually do anything for my ""winter stuffies"" but I really don't like the idea of over-medicating myself with prescriptions and otc drugs either, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Imagine my pleased surprise to find out this tea is both a soothing drinking experience and also...actually works! It has a nice, herby taste and not over-licoricey at all (which I feared, not being a fan.) Really nice with a drop of honey. And then, amazingly enough, my nose and lungs feel open and clear for hours after drinking this tea. One cup, and I ran back to my computer to order a subscription!"
3,Packaging problems,I have been drinking the tea for about a year now. The product is fine.My complaint is with the recent change on the individual tea bag envelope.The new lavendar colored envelopes are impossible to open without the aid of scissors (or my teeth).The previous two-tone envelopes tore open easily.Please revert back.
2,It's ok...my issue could be something else,"I bought this (herbal) tea for relief from (a couple months of) breathing issues. Thinking that I may have asthma (I've never been diagnosed). At first it was grand, helping my cough, soothing to my throat and chest. Then surprisingly my stomach started to gurgle and I was frequenting the loo, stopped taking things were fine. Finally, last night I tried nettle (2 caps) and some ginger with honey added tea..ahh relief, sleep! Tonight I will try angelica root and see if that helps."
1,Not Shipped Fresh!,"Just received my order today, October 30, 2006, but the ""Use Product by Date"" was October 13, 2006.Item is not eligible for return, so I'm stuck."
3,Depends how you make it.,"This brand of tortilla is a godsend for low-carb dieters, but this particular flavor is a little harsh and almost bitter if you eat it cold out of the fridge as a sandwich wrap. I recommend using this flavor either baked with cheese on it, or pan fried as a quesadilla.In general, this brand of tortilla is great. They're not as flexible as regular non-diet wraps, though, so be prepared for some breakage if you try to wrap something in it tightly."
2,Not really for kids - at least not all of it,"I would like to start by saying that I LOVE putumayo records and I have a gazillion of them at home. However, I am very dissapointed at this record. Although the sound might sound upbeat to parents, the only children's records are #1 through #5. Number 6 is a call to arms and violence by the Ecuatorian guerrilla. Of course you wouldn't know it if you don't know Spanish, because it is a very lively upbeat tune. However as a bilingual+ household, this is one I will not be playing to my 3 year old again. The rest are, as someone on this forum said, good for ambient music for the 30-something parents' party... but I think there's much better children's records out there in the Latin American world."
4,Really nice!,I bought this CD for my son (he is from Guatemala) in an effort to keep him exposed to Latin music. I like this CD very much. The performers have nice voices and the music is professional sounding (I have bought other latin CD's that sounded like they were recorded in someone's garage).Highly recommended!
3,It's Putumayo,"As it is a Putumayo CD, it is enjoyable but I think the World Playground CDs are better value"
3,Fun,"These songs are plain and simply, fun. We just let the CD play and everybody likes it. I will buy more in the Playground series."
2,Crap,Spend The Extra Money If You Plan On Using It On Your Car I Have A 90 Dollar One That This Was Going To Replace Not
2,Flexible But Not Soft,"These bristles are flexible and so easily bend around trim and other details, but the material is NOT very soft. The bristles feel exactly like those of a cheap paintbrush--scratchy plastic. The ends of the bristles have been sanded or squished to ""soften"" them but they are not soft like a quality brush. The bristles look like sun-damaged hair. There was a LOT of nylon dust in the brush when it arrived and had to be washed out several times.This brush is no softer than a similar brush I got at Costco several years ago. I prefer that one since the bristles wrap around the sides of the brush, which makes washing the car easier, faster, and less damaging."
3,It's a brush,"Don't know why all the wonderful reviews on this brush. I bought it as a replacement for a wonderful brush I had bought at Walmart. The bristles on this brush were not nearly as plush as the Walmart brand. If I had it to do over, I would choose another brand. This isn't it for my cars long term."
5,Much better than expected,Brush wires are soft yet full and durable. Din have to worry about scratching the vehicles but they get the job done!
1,Why do the publishers treat PC users this way?,"If you shop around for this game, you'll notice that there is a PC, PS2 and XBOX version - the boxes are almost identical. The XBOX and PS2 versions are actual 3-D adventures where you get to control the various characters of Bikini Bottom with some mini-games added-in. The console versions of the game are pretty good. The PC version IS NOT! It is basically a series of mind-numbing mini-games and 2-D platforming that tends to frustrate the kids more than anything else. My kids got tired of getting stuck and gave up.The funny part is that most XBOX and PS2 games are originally created with programming tools on the PC - so why create such a simplified uninteresting game for the PC user. Must have to do with licensing agreements so it won't compete with the consoles.I would avoid this game and let THQ know that they should create the same game for all the platforms they release it on (even if they need to charge the same price as the console version)!"
1,Changed my mind,Don't know why they will not let you enter a review without at least one star????After reading the reviews I have changed my mind about buying the Battle For Bikini Bottom. I will take this off my wish list and look for something else for my 5 year old to play. Thanks reviewers.
3,Spongebob is cool could be better,"This game is cool, but it is way too short. This was the first time I bought a game without reading reviews first. This was not really worth the money because it was to short, but this is one of those games that you can play a couple times after you bet it and you wont get too bored."
2,I'm returning it if that tells you anything.,I don't know why I gave it two stars. I guess I felt a little generous. I have been studying French for a little over 4 years and I wanted something really interactive. It's semi-interactive but most of it is just a jumbled mess. The exercies don't go together. There are no themes to choose from. It's hard to learn any new vocabulary when it is all jumbled together. I wouldn't call this instant immersion. I would call it instant confusion.
1,Zero stars should be an option for this product,"This is the worst software product that I've ever owned, bar none!!! It has no systematic plan of instruction and it thrust the user into language tranlation situations right out of the chute, with out even the slightest preparation.As a primer it is totally worthless. It doesn't begin with an overview of the alphbet, nor a review of basics of French grammar, nor does it deal with the elements of sentence structure. It jumps right into conversational translation without the least bit of preparation.If you are a beginner, steer clear of this product. It's a waste of your time and your money. Never have I encountered a more frustrating software product. Were I the developer, I would not want my name associated with this product."
3,Good for review only. Not for beginner learner.,"I found this really difficult to learn from. Since I had spoken French many years ago, I was able to remember some things. It was then that I realized this was actually quite effective for reviewing a language I was rusty in. And the voice recognition software was useful in refining my accent.I did think the voice recognition was a bit picky. I thought I had a fairly good accent. But the software wanted it to be exactly how the computer voice pronounced it--even so much as requiring me to raise and lower my voice.Overall, I would not recommend it to someone wanting to learn a new language. I would recommend it to someone wishing to brush-up or improve a language they're already familiar with."
3,Better as refresher and for phonetics,I bought this at a local store and was lucky in some sense that I already went through 5 years of written French in school (about 15 years ago). The CD will be difficult to use if you have absolutely no French background. Also while going through the audio CDs it would have been nice if you could see the actual spellings of what you were repeating. Other than that I believe it is ok. I gave it three stars but if I had no basic French linguistic skills I wouldnt give it more than 1.5 stars.
2,Only Audio,"It is an audio only cd with no visual. When learning a new language, I feel that visual is esential."
3,Only 1 song with multiple versions,I thought I was buying a whole CD but it turns out this is only 1 song with 4 different versions.
5,In Defense of Tort Law,"The media recently has created the impression that trial litigators often are vultures searching for frivolous complaints from which to extract millions in fees. Corporations seeking to avoid the consequences of policies which may seriously harm the consumer, the employee or the environment join with Republican politicians to reinforce this image. In Defense of Tort Law, Koenig and Rustad superbly demonstrate the reality and the legitimacy of many of the grievances that lead to suits against corporations. However these grievances are seldom adequately addressed because few middle class or working class individuals have the resources to confront multi-billion dollar corporations in long complicated expensive legal battles. The authors do an outstanding job of demonstrating that if punitive damages were eliminated, it would mean the end one of the few mechanism protecting the victims of corporate excess and the power of the corporation would be almost unlimited."
5,It's a Miracle,"After YEARS of assorted pain medications, creams, lotions, ice, heat etc. for osteoarthritis, my husband is finally able to sleep pain free with salonpas patches! They are a miracle for us! And so inexpensive comparatively! Salonpas are a blessing!"
5,Salonpas patches,My husband and I have both used salonpas patches both for RA and for back and joint pain. They worked so well we have recommended to several friends now we all use them. They give great fast relief and the size is perfect for any area. We would highly recommend.
1,IT'S LIKE PUTTING DUCT TAPE ON YOUR SKIN,"I've been using the OTC Salanpas medication for about 2 months and think that it is the best pain medicine OTC. My intent to purchase a larger quantity for less was achieved, except it has a lower dosage than what you would get OTC at Walmart. In addition, the material used deliver the medication and applied to the skin is like Duct Tape. It will pull the hairs off your skin. Beware of this product."
5,great!,works wonders and customer service was great. they sent me wrong item and took care of it promptly. i was very pleased with the product and the service.
5,Helps with pain,We bought these for my grandmother for her knees and legs. She has arthritis in them. They work quickly to help with the pain. It was a great cost so we bought the pack.I think we will be buying them again.
5,excellent relief for the price,"This product is easy to apply, lasts for several hours of relief! Can't be beat for the price! Will continue to reorder to keep around the house."
5,salonpas large patches,excellent product -- easy to use -- doesnt smell too strong --seems to work effectively to reduce arthritis type aches and pain in back and shoulders
2,problems,Very strong - caused bad skin outbreak - has taken weeks to heal - just be careful if you use it
2,The adhesive of this is insane,"I read the reviews and thought: How bad can this be? Well, the answer is: REALLY bad. It just doesn't pull out some stray hairs. It is like getting a patch off of you that has been super glued."
4,Pain Relief!,"Just what I needed for pain relief. I have a lot of lower back pain, and these cover enough surface area compared to using smaller patches. You feel the effects of the patch within the first hour or so, depending on how moist your skin is. One thing I should advise any of you that use these patches: make sure you remember to shave your bodily hairs before applying these, otherwise, removing the patches after use becomes rather painful and irritating."
3,Pain relief patches,"I bought it for my mother who suffers from lower and upper back pains and she says it works great for her. The only thing is that it does not stay on for more that two days, that is if you want the patch on for a long time."
5,Incredible information,"I am a product of the S.A.D(standard american diet) and despite this fact, this book completely changed my outlook regarding my health as well as my outlook regarding ""holistic medicine"". Easy to read, humorous, no pressure general guidelines that let you adapt at your own pace and in a manner that fits your lifestyle. I would recommend it for anyone who is ready for a big change to occur in their lives without a big disruption in their lifestyle."
3,Warming Up Left-Overs,"In typical Kitty Kelly style, this look at the Bush family is hardly flattering. Rather, it is akin to warming up left-overs, or a re-hash of generally familiar material. For those who have not been paying attention for the past couple of decades, and are not generally familiar, there may be a few revelations to raise eyebrows. Bottom line: the youngest Bush brother may want to disassociate himself from certain members of the family if he runs in 2016. Some aspects of Kelly's story are a touch toxic."
3,Moderate picture quality.,the fact that the 26 inch Sony Bravia is not a 1080p TV [it is 720p] makes for moderate picture quality. A built in DVD player would have added a lot of functionality. I like the overall finish and easy to use controls. My wife liked the fact that it is small enough for the bedroom. I wonder if it is worth the $717 that we paid...
5,Excellant TV,"This TV has a great picture and is just the right size for the room I have it in. I would buy it again. As a matter of fact, I bought the 46"" 1080 for the family room."
5,Gorgeous quality!,"Set up was a breeze. And the quality is beautiful. I am not a size queen, so the 26 inch is plenty big for any square footage! unless, i suppose, you are trying to build a home theater with stadium seating!"
3,Good Stuff,"I watched this video with my kids and it really hit home. It doesn't just say why drugs are bad but how they are bad for you. I'll smoke a joint every now and then but I don't want my 10 year old and 12 year old kids to start smoking pot yet. When they get older they can make there own decisons but should never do hard drugs. Marijuana is not a ""hard"" drug."
1,Buenos Aires - don't buy this CD,"I have several of the Frequent Flyer CD's and they are great, so I was very surprised when I played this one. What a dissappointment - monotonus and boring. Don't waste your time with this CD it is poorly done, poorly recorded and just plain boring."
3,OK game. Just Ok.,"This game has lots of player interaction, and is fairly quick to learn. The strategy is a little bit iffy as most of the game is spent guessing what others will decided to do and planning according ly. This is the case for most strategy games, but this one more so. The reason behind this is that you are constantly guessing at random what people will do. It is nearly impossible to predict accurately what the others will do, thus making the luck element high in this game.Bottom Line: Is it better than settlers? No. there is too much luck in this one. Will ADD gamers like this one? probably. It is fairly fast pace and light. Will I be keeping it? It is already gone."
4,The Grandma Mix-Up!,"Pip's parents are going on vacation. Dad called and asked Grandma Sal to baby-sit without knowing that Mom had already called Grandma Nan. On the day Pip's parents were leaving, both Grandmas showed up!Grandma Nan is too strict. Grandma Sal is too laid back. Both of them are driving Pip insane. He doesn't know what to do!I think that this book is really cute. It seems to remind me of my grandparents. It would drive me crazy, like Pip, if both of them got together. This story is silly and somewhat entertaining. I believe that it is best for a young reader who will easily comprehend. It's a good story."
5,Fast!,This product shipped quickly and was exactly what I was looking for. Description was correct making it easy to find this specific product.
1,To big of a price for such a tiny bottle!,"This must have been a free sample that some person decided to sale! The bottle is so tiny, I will not buy again, I would just go to the mall to buy the same product in a bigger bottle for the same price! Shame on YOU!!!!!"
2,Picture is confusing,The item is not what is shown on the picture. Although it is true .14oz. the picture shows a bigger size.
1,Awful!,"It smell's awful! Nothing like what I would buy in the store. Came in bubble wrap, no label. On the bottom of the bottle was a sticker that said ""Sample. Not for individual sale"". I've been taken!"
2,Former OHio Player frontman falls in face.,"I did not know who junie was. I however knew his voice from the early Ohio Players recordings (Pain, Pleasure, Ectasy.) This CD has many, many songs that are all over the place. This is a compilation. I have found compilations may not do the artist justice. My favorite song that saved from two stars was ""super groupie"". Slow groove of lament, being dumped by a groupie. EXCELLENT INSTRUMENTALIST.sOME SONGS ARE VERY MALE ORIENTED. Seems Junie was obsessed with groupies. Lastly, Junie tried some early disco sound. Again all over the place. If not familar, buy it used."
4,Good old Kamelot,"This album is worth having for diehard Kamelot fans. Compared to their recent releases like Epica, The Black Halo, this album lacks the innovative sounds, but the music is yet melodic and great to hear. Even the lyrics are okay. I have Eternity to buy to complete my Kamelot collection."
3,"A good album -> 3,5 stars",THis album is a little better then their first album but its not so great. Its a little better than just ok . I hope they change for the better in the future
1,Beware!,"I recently purchased this DVD set because the price was minimal. Before I got to take it out of the plastic I noticed a promotion stating one of the DVD had a transsexual superstar in a starring role. I personally like ladies exclusively, and not wanna be women. I have not decided if I will throw the DVD set out with the morning trash or take a chance on viewing the second DVD. Unless you are into that gender confusion, I would think twice before purchasing this DVD."
3,"Works as advertised, but fan is NOISY","The build quality of this product is solid overall. The documentation is excellent, and installation was fairly straightforward using the provided template. The only difficulty I encountered was that the vent cover did not initially snap into place as stated in the manual and required some creative adjustment.The fan operates as described, turning on only when its temperature threshold is reached and turning off when the heat inside my cabinet dissipates. My one complaint with this product is that the fan itself is NOT as quiet as I had hoped.I can hear it distinctly when listening to my system at low volume. This is definitely something to consider depending on the proximity of your media cabinet to your listening position. In my case, I feel that the benefits provided by this solution - i.e., extending the lifespan of my A/V equipment by keeping my cabinet properly ventilated - outweigh the one negative."
4,One great import!,"First of all, I would like to say that this is a pretty amazing service! I have tried to find this C.D. EVERYWHERE! But it can not be purchased in the U.S., just Europe. Amazing production, explosive sounds. A very good C.D."
1,Too bad,It was defective and there wasn't another one available. I gave it one star just to proceed. Too bad there wasn't another one available.
1,Very Marcinko-like,"The stories are so-so. This book, like the others of Linderer's offers no proof and is not a scholarly work. No cited resources to double-check the stories written herein. I found this a waste of money. Too many pages on the 101st Lerpies that according to the book 'THE HISTORY OF THE MACV RECONDO SCHOOL' by, Tom Halliwell had the highest drop-out rate of any other unit in RVN going through the course."
1,This game is lousy,"I bought this game because my kids love the Fairly Odd Parents show. This game contains a bunch of arcarde-like challenges, such as navigating through Vicki's nose. These were too hard for my 5 year old, and not very interesting for my 8 year old. There's no strategy or thinking involved. If your kids are used to playing StarFlyers or ClueFinders, they'll be completely bored with this game in 2 days. Don't waste your money."
1,Fairly Odd Parents-Breaking da Rules,"I bought this game for my six year old. It contains stupid arcade type games. Though she loves the show, at six, my kid thinks it stinks too. What a waste. Marketing the Fairly Odd Parents characters makes Nickelodeon tons of money. They could/should do such a better job! Shame on them!!!!"
5,The best game in da world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Navagating thru vickys nose and stuff was assome buy it now or ur missing sumthing BIG great 4 10+
3,Not perfect and not for everyone...,"I think this program can help if you use it right. I ordered this program about 3 years ago(Y2K, Seems like yesterday!). I did the whole 5 days a week program starting from week 1. After about 6 weeks, I got nothing. Even though I did feel like I might have gained like an inch or so. But then the workouts got too exhausting and seemed to hinder my vertical. But now, I been thinking about starting again from Week 6 and doin it 3 times a week instead of 5. My advice to anyone who wants this is to pick a week that is challenging and after week 12 add the reccomended amount of reps and sets according the book each week. If you do anything that exhausts your legs like walking a far distance or playing pick up games, do the program 3 times a week. I always thought 5 times a week was tooo much. Isn't the theory that if you workout, you should rest 48 hours before doing it again? I think that gains will come much quicker that way."
2,this thing is awesome,"so u have read all other reviews, eh? Dont they just sound fake, as if the booker's writer wrote all those stuff. i've been using this for 4 weeks. Nothing much happened yet. I suggest you to think about it before you buy it"
4,"Laziest of the WB Shorts Movies, but the Best!","I know, I know. It's the laziest of the bunch, but it's the best because it has better shorts than the others."
4,"NC-17, if rated in the USA","This is an adult film and if rated in the USA, it would be NC-17. It definitely is inappropriate for anyone under 17. It was inspired by something from Greek mythology, but is set in modern France. It has some very disturbing scenes. Without looking up reviews, I cannot say that I understood what the director was exactly trying to say. It does have some expositions of a part of society that are not talked about openly, so I would say that this lack of exposure probably explains somewhat my lack of understanding of the themes that the director had in mind."
3,interesting film and topic,"I liked the movie, but it got a little too ""French"" at the end - the ending made no sense at all. I'd like to see what Hollywood could do with the topic."
2,NOT for beginners!,"I am extremely dissapointed with this software! It is DEFINATELY not for beginners!! You jump right into Spanish without ""learning"" anything. There are ""options"" to slow down speech but it doesn't work...when you click, nothing drags...There are no instructions with this. It is difficult to figure out. And I'm only on ""beginner 1"". I will never get through the next 7 cds. #1 is very dissapointing. No instruction...just exercises."
2,Not for those who don't know the basics,I am good with languages (fortunatly) but this software I would NOT recommend unless you're trying to brush up your already EXISTING skills. The Audio CD's were great though! I learned a lot from them. But they only give you 3 so you're cut off once you learn how to conjugate regular verbs and about three irregular verbs.
3,Spanish,I'ts good! i take spanish in school and it helped me out. my grade went up. the only thing i didnt like is the vocab it was a little different than mine at school because i learn mexican spanish and i think this is spain spanish.
1,Won't run on a Vista Machine,I bought this a couple years ago and never got around to using it. Today I installed it on my new Vista machine and it doesn't run on Vista.
1,Look away,Both my husband and I were very disappointed with this CD set. I would recommend that you avoid it all together. It was very difficult to navigate through and does not start out on a beginner level.
1,Do NOT buy this,"This program is very difficult to use, as well as learn from. i've taken 2 years of spanish, and found this program to be NOT useful at all for learning spanish, continuing to learn spanish or even as a fun program to brush up your spanish. The program itself is not intuitive, and there are no installation directions. My recommendation is to find something else or go to a class."
1,Absolutely terrible.,"An unorganized mashup of goofy games that do nothing but possibly slightly reinforce your existing knowledge of Spanish. I don't see how they expect someone with no Spanish speaking ability to learn anything with these CDs.If you're looking to learn Spanish, go elsewhere. Waste of money."
2,needs to be better,i know no spanish even though my father is mexican. i bought this to help me learn...wel i am almost through the first less ion and am having problums so its not really for beginers. it askes you to finish and questtion and place in the missing word and such but to say the sentence as fast as them and correctly is not possable if you dont know the language well enough so its crap. the idea behind it is good but how they go about teaching you is messed up.
3,WHAT IS YOUR MALFUNCTION. CAN'T YOU READ?,"IMMERSION: The act of immersing: a state of being immersed; specifically : baptism by complete submersion into a subject or thing.Perhaps the beginner should review their English skills before ""Immersing"" themselves into Spanish?BTW: I didn't like the software interface; I found it to be very clumsy."
1,PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I agree with the person who wrote that this software presumes that you already know a good bit of Spanish. I have had 3 years of high school and 2 years of college Spanish and bought this product for review for my job. Believe me when I say this is NOT for a beginner. I found it difficult to start reviewing at the level they describe as beginner. The software is confusing to navigate even if you have a Spanish language background. You are definitely ""immersed"" in Spanish in this software, but the way it's organized, being ""immersed"" is simply a euphemism for being totally lost. I suggest you go with a more ""beginner friendly"" program."
4,"good, but short","And it is clearly described as short... but it always hard to guess what that means. What it means is that you can pull it down over ears as long as you don't fold the bottom up. The larger size they sell fits perfectly when doing that, and I ended up buying one of those as well. Both are nice and warm, simple, cheap and seem to be made fairly well."
2,Holes are uneven,The holes are not all the same size and it is hard (if not impossible)to get pens to fit and stay in.
4,Thanks. It's very convenient.,This 5-hole Staff Liner is just what I needed for teaching music on a dry erase board. It's been a long time coming and now I'm afraid of getting spoiled into not being able to draw the lines free-hand anymore. It saves time and makes the material I write neater. I appreciate it.John
1,Holes don't fit!!,"The markers don't draw well and markers don't stay well in holder. I often have to redraw a line or two. Brought just about every type of dry erase staff maker. Don't waste your money, get a ""vice grip"" staff maker."
1,"it sucks, the company sucks","I ordered a repair manual for my Kia, I have no idea what they sent me but it was not in English and apparently their customer service sucks and Amazon would not step up to the plate either.. So I was looking forward to a restocking fee and being stuck paying postage. Well ""they"" said the book arrived damaged, and I got assessed additional fees. So I will not be ordering anything from these folks again, and I am not sure if I will order anything from Amazon either since they did not support me. I have returned things in the past but never had any such issues..."
4,Like an original,"I bought two of them. These batteries work as the OEM in my Sony Ericsson W600i. Excellent price, good product, fast delivery."
2,short life,"This battery's standby time and talk time are far short of OEM battery. I would estimate less than 50% of OEM. However, for a couple of dollars it is an ok compromise."
5,Come out come out wherever you are,"This is a beuatiful book in every way. Tom Baril is a terrific printer and photographer. These images are testament to that fact and if you can find this book, buy it without blinking. Image quality aside, this book is very well made in every way. The quality of the paper and printing is of a quality I have only rarely seen in photo books. Only 2,500 copies were printed and snapped up faster than you can say Jack Robinson. This is an amazing example of what photo books can be. It is a wonderful addition to any collection. Happy hunting for it. I bought mine from a gallery which sells his photos. I should have bought it when it was in the bookstores staring me in the face. Don't make the same mistake I made, dear reader. Then again, if you're reading this you already have"
5,Wonderfully musical performances,"This is to my mind the most satisfying of any set of the Bach lute suites, whether played on lute or guitar. The BIS recording is exemplory, the baroque lute by Michael Lowe has a clear, sweet sound, and Lindberg's performances are at once thoughtful, sober, and at the same time, lyrical, elegant, and never lacking in passion or commitment. While some might find there is an air of neutrality about the interprations, one comes back to these performances with increased satisfaction and the lack of mannerism or idiosycracy makes this the perfect set for repeated listening."
4,"Good, clean, no-risks performance.","Lindberg's playing is remarkably clean, free of any distracting mechanical noises and expertly executed. The recording is a little bright, but generally this is a very good set that is only in need of a degree more adventure from Lindberg. Players like Hopkinson Smith and Rolf Lislevand make more personal statements with their versions of these works, yet Lindberg will appeal to those who like their Bach played straightforwardly and without fuss."
2,Not very good.,"In this double CD Jacob Lindberg gives us his opinion on Bach's famous lute works.This opinon is to be found according to my opinion poor.Jacob Lindberg fails to give the necessary freedom to the works and therefore he is trapped in a stereotype interpretation not much different from any other.I personally adored Jacob Lindberg in the ""Virtuoso Lute Music from Italy and England"" (BIS-CD-211) where he had a quite strong and personal opinion on the works which actually gave the feeling of being in another century.But in this recording I was quite disappointed.The conclusion is that Jacob Lindberg doesn't yet control the works,on the other hand the works control his playing stripping it from any personal taste."
5,Buck Jam,"I decided to get this product based on the other good reviews I read. I would recommend this to anyone...The deer love it. We saw a definite increase in deer activity on our trail cameras. We later bought the apple, but they didnt seem to like it as much. The corn was a great hit though. We will continue to use it!!"
4,Great African Hip-hop,"Despite how many Hip-hop groups exist in Africa, very few are distributed in the US. This release has a wonderful sound: melodic, sing-songy and very engaging. The female vocals add a very nice dimension to the sound. Recommended."
5,They Fit Just Right,"It's hard to find household gloves that fit my hands -- they seem to always have just the large ones in the store, and those are so very clumsy for me to work with -- so I was very happy when I saw Amazon had these and with free super saver shipping.Though a little snug to pull on, my hands fit well in them once on. I got them to be mainly dishwashing gloves, to protect my hands from the warm water and the detergent, and I found these gloves to be perfectly suited for the job. Their grip is good, so I can grab wet dishes without fear of them slipping. And I can still feel hard food particles on the plates through the gloves.The other plus is that the inside lining is soft so they are comfortable to wear. I put lotion on my hands before I put them on, so now while I do the dishes my hands are being moisturized rather than being dried out. And afterwards, they come out feeling soft. All in all a good purchase."
2,Too small and too thin!,"I am a petite female with tinier hands and the size small wouldn't fit without quite a bit of pulling. Hot dishwater also was felt almost immediately through these gloves. Don't try saving money by buying these! Although, if you buy a larger size than needed and only use them for cleaning (not dishwashing), they may work for you."
4,"Good product, but they are Very small","I have thin hands with long fingers and these were a bit tight on me, but not unwearable. I think size wise these would be best for teenagers.Durability wise, these are excellent. I have a duplicate pair in medium that I use all the time and they have a tight grip. The interior flocking is very minimal, so you don't have to worry about slip, or mold growth if water gets in them. I've had these for about 6 months and no tears or punctures. Though if you have very long, or pointed nails, put a cotton ball in each finger tip to prevent any breakage.The only downside for me is that the opening is a little too big, and the gloves a little short, so if I'm washing dishes I have to be careful or I'll get water down inside of them, which is mildly unpleasant."
3,what can be said,They are rubber gloves and do work well. Seem stronger than others that I have tried. Would recommend them butuse baby powder to put them on.
2,Average product,"I mistakenly ordered these instead of Playtex Living gloves (the purple fold over ones). However, if you still choose to go with these, make sure you order a size larger - these are truly snug and I have tiny hands!Playtex Living Gloves, Small, Colors may vary"
5,My Favorite Seasoning,I love that this seasoning is salt free. It's the perfect blend of spices to add to spaghetti and lasagna. I'm now stationed overseas and I can't find this product anywhere...I'm so glad it's available on Amazon!
5,Great everytime,"Seeing these guys over and over in Fort Collins shows that they are humble even though they are growing in popularity. Get the CD. Great job guys, keep going back to Lucky Joe's!"
5,Awesome,"I absolutely love this cd. This is a great cd from Vegas to Break my Heart this is one of the best cd's I have heard in a very long time. Their new single Queen of Everything is great. You have got to at least try it out, you will not be dissapointed."
5,Unbelievable songwriting and even better performances,"Having seen this band live a few times over the years in various spots (Denver, Dallas, Chicago & New York City), I was anxious to pick up their latest release and was happy to hear that the quality of their live shows translated perfectly to record. The songwriting and lyrics are some of the best around today, and the guitar work is top notch. I know this album hasn't been out that long but I already look forward to their next release and hope that they come back through my town to play again. For those who dig having quality music that you can introduce to your friends and be proud of recommending, this one is a must have."
5,They Work!!,"I recently purchased the bostitch stapler that uses these staples and I am happy with both purchases. Much easier on my hands, clean, neat staples, and I haven't had a problem with restapling or damaged staples or marred paperwork."
5,Fabulous series,"This entire series (my 9 year old son has not yet read the 4th book) if terrific. The books are entertaining, humorous and fast paced. Nolan has problems that any elementary school boy might face - like being a nerd or facing a bully. Nolan handles his problems in a unique but clever way by using his computer geek skills. As a parent, I am thrilled with the moral lessons that can be found in each of these books - using brains is better than using force, your parents may not be as awful as you thought, all kids have the potential to be heroes, kids should strive for truth and justice... Buy this series for your kids. They will LOVE it - and so will you."
5,Best book ever!!!!!,"Action, wondering, amazing, AWESOMENESS!!!!!! Great book!! You should read this book, is hot action and makes you wonder what's going to happen next!"
4,Granddaughter loves this series!,"After reading Shredderman 1 & 2 my 9 year old granddaughter just had to have 3 and 4. It's a great series on honesty, doing the right thing, bullying and creativity."
5,Shredderman #3 Meet the Gecko,"Shredderman #3 Meet the GeckoShredderman #3 Meet the Gecko is about this kid named Nolan Byrd getting to go meet the gecko, his favorite T.V. superhero whose real name is Chase Morton. When before he goes he finds out his enemy Alvin ""Bubba"" Bixby the bully is going to meet the gecko or Chase Morton. Find out the adventures he goes through.Overall I'd give this book 5 out of 5 stars because it's a great book for kids of all ages who like to read chapter books. It's very adventurous. I highly recommend this book."
2,Not for Me,"Thought this had what I might be looking for, but it didn't. Made a nice gift for a Finnish American friend."
5,Made my Christmas,This album is a remake of one I had almost 50 years ago. It is the only one they produced that has O How a Rose 'ere' Blooming (a/k/a The Christmas Rose.) I was so happy to find it as it was always my favorite Christmas album.
5,Absolutely The Best!,"I too grew up with this recording and have always been entralled with it. As a High School student I sang in the choir, and we used my record of this recording to listen to, and emulate the carols that we were singing for our Christmas performance. I've been looking for this specific recording on CD for years and am delighted to finally have found it. It is absolutley the best Christmas recording ever!"
5,a personal favorite,This book really changed my way of thinking about the future. It gives useful advice written in a way that is easy to understand. It is funny too.
5,Alison James has a great sense of humor!,"I have read The 10 Women You'll Be before you're 35 and laughed out loud! This book is even better than her first, and I loved that book. Alson has a way of making you see yourself in her books with a style that makes you laugh and realize that we can't take things too seriously - as soon as you get used to things - they change and so do you! She has a great style of writing - touches on topics that every woman reading this book can relate to."
4,A Good Read,This book is a great humorous read and look at the many changes that a female will go through in becoming a woman.You will laugh but it will make you think. Being a woman is more complex than it appears.
4,Holocaust,"Rescuers Defying the Nazis, by Toby Axelrod, is a non-fiction book about non-Jewish teens who rescued Jewish families from the Holocaust. This book uses examples of rescue accounts and real quotes and passages from Jewish and non-Jewish survivors during the 1940's. The book also helps to portray the realism of te danger involved with helping Jews as well as the was and Hitler's reign."
1,JUNK!!!!,"Stay as far away from this piece of trash as possible. How this man has the nerve to compare him and the group Oasis to the Beatles is beyond me. He went as far as to say they were better, wow!! The man has huge Balls. This cd I heard played on a local radio station, and needless to say, it was never heard of again. The radio station played it when it was first released in 2005. I guess its like a accident you see on the highway, you know its going to be horrible, but human nature says you look anyway. This is definately like a car accident, only they are an accident, and sound better than this junk. Liam Gallagher's voice sounds like an animal screaming out in pain caught in a leg hold trap. His brother was a great singer when with Oasis, however the family talent obviously skipped Liam. Yuck!!!!!. Trash, pure trash, that's why it has been deleted by his record company. Time to get a real job Liam. Because you certainly can't sing."
5,Very challenging and inspiring,"This book zeroes in on possibly the core issue of progress as we know it. In maximizing certain kinds of production, we are systematically ""weeding out"" other kinds of life. Shiva conducts a whirlwind tour of what this means for agriculture, biodiversity, the economy, politics, and human values. What do we have when only certain types of plants and people are valued? I found this a very challenging and inspiring piece of work.--author of The Gardens of Their Dreams: Desertification and Culture in World History"
5,Am I Becoming . . My Mother ?,"My mother always used rubber gloves to wash the dishes. Still does.But I was part of the `Palmolive' generation. You know, `. . softens your hands . . while you do the dishes.' Thanks, Madge.Well, I recently tackled a huge spring cleaning project - which scrubbed my fingers raw.Imagine my surprise when I found these on Amazon - with Amazon Prime free shipping. Halleluiah!I don't even know - if my local supermarket carries `em.These fit perfectly. (I just ordered the same size - as my golf glove - and it worked out pretty well.)And, oh - what a relief. My hands feel so much better. Enjoy."
5,Useful gloves,They fit! I use every day for my dishes. They are sturdy They were shipped quickly I love them a lot.
3,Not great for extremely hot water,"I wanted to use these to protect my hands from some very hot water (150 degrees) and they didn't do the trick. If the water is hot enough (it can get hot enough just out of the faucet) it's like you don't have any gloves on at all. If I had to get these over again, I'd get a thicker version."
3,Neil's Review,I wish these lasted longer and could be used in kitchen hot water. The gloves are otherwise good compared to what is in the market.
2,No Way These are LARGE!,"I have small hands with long fingers and these are snug. So I'm not the happy camper, or should I say cleaner, I expected to be sharable. These fit me but not others in the household :("
2,You need to be a master craftsman!,This book is quite old fashioned and the ideas and machines are only viable if you or your partner happen to be a master woodwork craftsman. For example the water wheel looks amazing but totally out of my reach as a steiner inspired homeschool mother of two! Some creations are simple but I've seen them in other books as well. I chose this book as it was highly recommended by others and necessary for some waldorf curriculums. I therefore feel the need to balance these idealistic opinions with a dose of reality.I would not recommend this book to the general public and I regret wasting money on it.
1,it has been a month,it has been a month now - I have never waited this long on the Internet. i know they gave me the window until March 3rd. i kind of knew it then but was hoping they would not push it till the very last moment...
4,Rebeccas Review,"The book that I read is about a girl that has three journals where she writes about that things that are going on her life.One is for things that she need to know and dreams.The things that I like most about this book was everythig that it said that I did not know.I can not say that I did not like it because my book was really good.I like little girl karal becase she talks about the things that are good in her life and that really important.On page 6 I like that passage becaude it talks about things in hre life. Most of the things are for little girls like her too. This book has lots of things to say to other people. A question I had was, what are the two names of the little brothers? Overall I liked this book and recommend it for other kids."
2,An Incomplete Collection,"This collection is incomplete without the celestial sound of Michele Tumes and her ""Untamed Lion"". Why was this excluded?"
3,maybe not,"I've been reading and rereading this series for 11 years and from my understanding, despite those who adamantly say the opposite, C.S. Lewis had no intention of this being a book about Christianity. Recently his grandson has come out to emphasize this fact.That said it's nice that artists used an understanding of the books to create their songs.This is much better than a lot of sountracks from recent movies that just feature a collection of unrelated songs by popular artists."
2,Another Alternative?,"In terms of the Narnian feel of the music and lyrics, some people, myself included, may prefer the 2nd Chapter of Acts album titled The Roar of Love. It's also available on Amazon.com from Sparrow records. The songs pretty much track the story of the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.I will admit though that I enjoyed Turkish Delight in both albums because it gave me that deep seated feeling of comprehending the insidiousness of sin and the way we humans can get caught up in it."
5,Does Narnia Proud,"This is a really fun Cd. It captures so much of Narnia in the different songs. If your a Christian music fan or not you should pick this one up. Or even use it to prove to friends that Christian music is really good. My favorite tracks have to be Tobymac's, New World. This is a really awesome song. Roll down the windows cause this on will get you rockin. I also really like Bethany Dillon's Hero. She is a great artist who writes really touching music. Kutless writes about Peter in the powerfull song, More Then It Seems. Overall, every song is really good and this is a must for Narnia fans."
4,Very good but not great,"This release excited me, as I am a fan of most of the artists on this cd. However, a few of the tracks were disappointments.Waiting for the World to Fall(1), Open Up Your Eyes(3), Lion(6) and New World(7) are the best tracks on the cd. The lyrics are powerfully insightful in relation to the story, especially those in Lion and New World.The tracks by Steven Curtis Chapman, Bethany Dillon, Delerious and Nichole Nordeman are ok. I don't find them amazing, but they are good.For those who like a funky song, Turkish Delight by David Crowder Band is just plain silly. I usually skip this track.I also skip the last track - Chris Tomlin sings another uninspired and lyrically lacking song. Some may like Tomlin, and if you do, it's a good song.This album is very good - all the tracks are better than average, although everyone will have his or her favorite tracks."
3,Where is Michelle Tumes?,"Nice album but where is Michelle Tumes' ""Untame Lion""? This album is missing her awesome angelic voice. I would have given it a higher score if this song wasn't missing."
4,find yourself through friends,This book affords you the way in which to look deep within yourself to find happiness that is not superficial. Find your real friends and make new. Have a great time. No limit to the possibilities of your soul.
1,Takes the Reader Down a Slippery Slope,"Under the guise of promoting ""civil"" dialogue, Etzioni takes the reader down a slippery slope whereby ""community standards"" are allowed to eclipse the rights of individuals.This is particularly scary if you are a member, as I am, of a minority. When individual rights are abrogated, then those of us in the minority are subject to ""The Tyranny of the Majority"" (as the much-reviled Lani Guinier appropriately titled her book). Etzioni doesn't give enough thought to the protections necessary for those who espouse unpopular beliefs or belong to minority groups.A far better book is Deborah Tannen's ""The Argument Culture"" which replaces coercion with dialogue."
5,Everyone knows a Micol....,"This text was on the Intro to European Literature reading list at Princeton University. Best book of the course, and one of my favorites of all time. This is a story of love and remembrance written from the vantage of an older Italian Jew looking back on the second world war. Micol Finzi-Continis is like every boy's first crush, and though we all move on in life from past to present, we always remember fondly those we loved before. Though written originally in Italian, I found the translation to be beautiful. A quick read, but it leaves a lasting impression."
5,Who Knew!,"What a great find. Originals are wonderful as are the covers. The lead singers voice is as pure as Emmy Lou's. I have seen them in concert & they are even better in person, which is not such an easy task considering all the sofisticated layering of the music. I am particularly fond of the mandolin. You don't hear it played very often with this much conviction. I run a restaurant & my customers are just loving listening to this cd played at the bar. The most asked question is ""Who is this? Once again I give it a strong 5 stars"
5,Influential and poignant album.,"This album is difficult to categorize due to its broadcross-cutting of several genres of music: folk, classical, country. I am amazed by the depth and creativity of thesinging and musical arrangements. I hear remnants ofHoliday and Baez set to images from fairy tales and dreamlike songs of my childhood. This album is as hauntingly beautiful as it is diverse. I have found myself moved by a plethora of scenes evoked by the content of the songs, from the enchantment of landscapes to tales of drinking too much. I recommend Rabbit Songs without hesitation."
5,Album of the Year,"A quick note correcting a previous reviewer...""The Cuckoo"" predates the Harry Smith Anthology by a long shot and has been covered by artists as diverse as Doc Watson and The Be Good Tanyas...What's more, Hem correctly attribute the song as ""traditional"" in their liner notes. Rabbit Songs is my favorite album of the year if not the last five years..."
5,Classic,"This record is a breath of fresh air. It recalls early American music, mid60's Nashville and smoky barroom jazz. The singer has a fantastic Ella-ish voice and the arrangements are both creative and evocative. The music has a definite country tinge to but manages to cover quite a bit more ground. This reminds me a bit of Gillian Welch but is more creaky and old sounding. good lyrics as well. I highly recommend it."
5,Simply beautiful,"The lead singer has a wonderful, ethereal voice that is at once melancholy and hopeful. Even alone she'd be great, but she's backed by fluidly beautiful and well-arranged instrumentals that are reminiscent of the best folk group you've ever heard. Except that this is probably better. ""Half Acre"" is still my favorite, but the rest of the disc is quickly catching up. I can't say enough good things about it, so instead I say... Buy it. Now. You'll love it, and if we all buy enough copies, maybe they'll be able to make another one."
3,Needs some spunk,"I'm glad I purchased this because some portions of these songs and sounds are flawless, but overall it lacks something. I found myself really missing a bass end to all of these arrangements. There are also no drums or meaningful percussion. This lacking makes the overall sound rather thin and shallow. I longed for some richness and depth, some variance, some movement, and that's something a few flashes of brilliance cannot make up for. In this end, this CD is merely pleasant, when it could have been great."
3,"Pretty, but..","The songs & the singing are really booooring. I give it 2.5 stars. I really tried to like this album because it sounds like a lot of other music that I really love. It just didn't work out, though. There a ton of pretty albums by many artists, and this one doesn't stand out at all. The songwriting & arrangements are lacking, and the vocals are sedate. I own Eveningland, which albeit overproduced in some tracks, is an overall improvement from this record."
5,Excellent British Series,Why are the British so good at these murder mysteries? You won't be able to turn the TV off until the last disk is done.
1,McCallum: The Series,"The series is over burdened with promiscuous sex, nudity, booze, sex and gore.The plot gets lost in the smart, slurred, unintelligible, angry dialog but that doesn't matter-the program is about shock and gore and more gore. It is sick and I am sorry I wasted money on it."
2,Disappointing.,"The series suffers from an obsession with promiscuous sex and nudity that add nothing to the plots of the episodes. When the characters aren't preoccupied with sex, they are preoccupied with drinking. In the midst of this the writers throw in a murder and the characters take a break from their debauchery just long enough to solve the crime and catch the bad guys. Not worth owning."
1,What a waste,"My review here is no reflection on Amazon.com. This guy can't act. Nor can he talk. One of my Grandmothers is from Yorkshire, and the other one is from Manchester so I am used to the British accent, but I have to listen very very carefully to understand this guy. He's Scottish isn't he? With the possible exception of the lab Phd. there's not one person in this whole series that can act. I was very disappointed. To say that this was the predecessor of the CSI franchises, is to insult good programming. Even though those CSIs have jumped the shark by now."
4,starts well and goes downhill from there,John Hannah and rest of cast struggle with a common problem...writers who start like an Olympic sprinter and end totally unravelled barely able to get across the finish line. Too much silly business of McCallum acting like a 12 yr old and then audience expected to believe he is a crack intellect full of perception...without sense enough to keep his pants zipped...people are just written out of the series and others grabbed to fill the void..the last show it would seem we are to believe McCallum in living the good life in LA...no other explanation and a new head pathologist and VERY irritating and unprofessional assistant...if they weren't going to meet Hannah's salary just end the program...which is what must have happenned....UNRAVELING and whimpering to an end...too bad...it was a good premise
4,My views on the McCallum series,"The stories were excellent. I was surprised, however, at the amount of full nudity shown and sexual situations. They were totally unnecessary and did not enhance the stories. Also, the last episode did not even have McCallum in it,but was like a pilot for the Lynley series. That was very disappointing, especially after we had gotten to see relationships grow, go through problems, find solutions, and had gotten to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the characters. My wife and I decided if we ever decide to watch the series again, doubtful, we will just skip the last episode."
2,Cheap and shoddy,"I bought the series based on the Amazon reviews as well as the lead actor John Hannah. Both have let me down terribly. Hannah is a much more mannered actor than I had previously realized, taking quick shortcuts to show complex emotions. And the scripts gets sillier as the series progresses. Some might call it gritty and realistic, I just call it cheap and shoddy.To say that this series inspired CSI is like saying the Egg McMuffin inspired Eggs Benedict."
5,An absolute must for anyone interested in battery chemistry,"OK, it may be over 50 years old but this book should be essential reading for anyone interested in secondary battery design, particulary lead-acid types. The first chapter starts with a great history lesson on battery development from Volta's first discoveries, over 200 years ago, and provides a great chronicle of events over the 100+ years following. Includes very detailed information on battery plate design, alloys and a breakdown of all the secondary reactions occuring within a cell. If you are researching Battery design then I would strongly recommend that you invenst in a copy of this book (if you can find one that is) after all the laws of physics (and chemistry) haven't changed in the last 50 years!"
1,"Junk, bought two both bad","one lasted long enough that i never got to actually use it before it broke. the other i bought for a friend and it was DOA from day one. looks pretty and compact, appears to take a charge, keeps it for less time than it took you to earn the wasted money."
1,DO NOT BUY,Did not work with an iPhone.Actually it was defective. Customer service from the manufacturer is horrible. Beware. Be warned!
4,Excellent External Power supply,I ordered this to power my GPS receiver for my Nikon D200. I didn't like the idea of using the camera's battery to power the receiver because as it is D200 doesn't give a good battery life. This has a on/off switch too which allows me to switch off my receiver when I switch off my camera. This is not possible if you use Nikon's MC-35 cord to connect to a GPS receiver. I have used velcro to fix this and the GPS receiver together to my camera's strap
