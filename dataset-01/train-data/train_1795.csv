4,great compact tripod,tripod is sturdy enough to feel comfortable putting an expensive piece of equipment on it without breaking into a sweat. Packs quite small despite being close to full size... legs lock tightly but breakdown quick... I'm happy.
4,Good product for the price,"Please beaware that it doesnot have a Bubble level. I initially checked all the features of this product while buying online, and was quite interested in the bubble level. But the actauol product doesnot have a bubble level.As such it work fine and is quite sturdy, plus compact. The Carry bag is of quite good quality."
3,not for the professional,"it's quite portable and light and can fulfill the needs of a normal user, but with a lot of sacrifices. the locking mechanism of the legs are kinda flimsy, the legs actually locked only when they are fully extended. no level bubble meter."
2,didn't last very long,"twice as heavy as other lightweight portables regarding total backpack weight.. and it BROKE after about 6 months No abuse, but one of the legs pulled out of the socket, and the socket broke apparently from pulling out aforesaid leg. Gluing it back in is not working real well. I am going to buy something else very soon. nice compact size when folded, though. ultimately, thumbs down."
5,Best purchase ever!!!,"My fiance and I bought this little guy before our motorcycle road trip through California. We were both on my Harley, and so space was limited for 2 people on a week long road trip. This tripod folded up so small it hardly took up any room. Then when we pulled it out and expanded the legs, it stood about 4 feet or so. Really good for a small light tripod. I don't think I would put a DLR camera with a telephoto lens on it, but for my little 7 Megapixel camera and my HDD video camera, it worked GREAT!"
2,Not as small as my other tripod but sturdy,I have another tripod which is smaller and has a carrying case which has a large enough strap to go around your shoulder. The only set back is that it does not have a quick release but I rather have more portability. I have taken it to all my travels. It is so small and yet performs much like a full scale tripod. The tourist 5 did disappoint me because I thought it was going to be smaller and the carrying case you have to hold it with your hand instead putting in around your shoulders. But it is good firm quality and has a quick release.
4,excellent tripod,"this is an excellent tripod for traveling, or anywhere. Small, lite weight, and expands to good size."
4,Good thing in a small package,"This is a good travelling tripod. It comes with its own carrying case, is reasonably light, sets up quickly, extends to an acceptable height, and allows for various camera positions."
1,nearly useless,"Proverbs are listed in no particular. Needing to find ""Dulce et decorum est ...."", I had no choice but to thumb through the1188 entries on 256 pages. Not there. Had I known that the author was Horatius, I would only have had to search his 30 or so entries spread over 30 or so pages, to no avail. With random order, and with no index besides the authors' names, this book was a waste of money. I'm sending it back."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT,"Had these headphones for about a month. They are comfortable to wear,but the sound is not as good as I thought it would be. The headphones are a little overprice in my opinion."
5,found my perfect headphones,"watched a review and these looked like the headphones for me, I have trouble finding ones that fit and are comfortable, and end up breaking them they fit well for people with large heads and big ears, that whats i like i guess and couldnt be more comfortable, you can also tell there was some quality put into them unlike the hype beats by dre comparison. If you used to small headphones or earbuds or have a small head i wouldnt recommend, cuz they might be too big, but the sound quality is pretty much spot on and u get 2 cords one just about long enough to use at a laptop and another for straight djing 1/4 inch only. made in taiwan> china lol"
5,intensly awesomly sexy,this is a very sexy movie never thought there were so many hot nuns...im glad there are!!!!! bravo bravo...
2,Offensively inaccurate,"In the words of Gentileschi biographer Mary Garrard and cultural commentator Gloria Steinem, ""In the fully documented trial of 1612, Agostino Tassi was charged with and convicted of the rape of Artemisia Gentileschi. He never confessed to the crime, and on the contrary, tried to accuse Artemisia's father of having deflowered her, and to insist she had also written love letters to other men -- though she could barely write at the time. Artemisia testified repeatedly under oath and torture that she had been [raped] by Tassi. She described the event in explicit and graphic detail, and her own resistance to the point of wounding him with a knife.""I give the film two stars for being beautifully made, but the falsehood of the movie undermines the few good elements."
3,That certain je ne sais quoi,"I rented this one from our library, and it worth exactly what I paid for it. The scenery and costumes (and lack thereof) are stunning and obviously meticulously researched. Why only three stars? The film seems to be, like a gallery of Renaissance paintings, a succession of beautiful images that have no real connection or overarching storyline. We see Artemisia's story as a series of the actress' pouting lips and desperately emoting eyebrows, but have no real sense of her history or of her personality. A beautiful film to watch, and not a waste of time, but certainly nothing to inspire much thought afterwards."
3,"Historically, not that accurate, but a good movie!","I first learned of Gentileschi my senior year in high school. I spent a semester doing a huge report on her in my english composition class. I have to say, this movie, although not completely accurate, does shed light on what life was like for the artist. She was not only a great painter, but a strong woman. This movie doesn't show this very well, and I have to say, that's disappointing. It's a good flick though. And if you can put the inaccuratcies (sp?) aside, then you should definately consider watching this."
5,A great movie!,"Historical debate aside, the movie was well filmed and enjoyable to watch. As a previous reviewer mentioned... it did cause me to read more about her and look at some of her paintings... so the more the better! As with many historical controversies, looking at different viewpoints AND doing your own research/thinking on the subject is the only way to go! ex: Did Shakespeare really write all those plays????"
3,"As a story and movie, it's...okay","This is the story of Artemisia Gentileschi. According to the end of the movie, she was the first woman painter to be commissioned for her work. I decided to do a little research since to be honest, I haven't heard of her. I guess from the information I have found, this film is a romanticize version of her early life. In this film, she is shown to be a precocious minx who falls in love with Agostino Tassi, her mentor. What I've read, she was raped. I don't want to give too much away, you can Google information yourself before/after or instead of watching the movie. This film borders on pornography and to some viewers I'm sure it will be pornography. Even I'm not sure. So this will be offensive to some and definitely not for children. If anyone is interested in learning more about her, I personally would not recommend this movie. Read a book about her or check out a biography of her here on the internet."
4,Artemisia,Beautiful representation of the life of a woman that could be considered a landmark in the history of painters
1,Wretched Tripe,"The first ten minutes into this movie I knew it was going ot be a bitter disappointment. Take a good look at the real Artemisia Gentileschi's self portrait - she does not look like an undernourished teenager. Take a good look at the actress they picked for this movie. Right. Not even close.Other reviewers have done a better job pointing out various other flaws - this was just the first one that offended me about this piece of trash of a movie.If you love the work of Artemisia Gentileschi, stay far away from this vile movie."
1,Not the true story...,"When this movie was first released, due to the outcry from the feminist and art history communities, Miramax had to remove their claim that it was ""the true story of the first female painter in art history."" Actually, it is practically a complete inversion of Artemisia Gentileschi's real story...she was in fact raped by Tassi (the 'love interest' in the movie) and maintained her stand *against* him even under torture (as is documented in the records of the trial). The film romanticizes and sexualizes her and their relationship to an almost soft-porn level while giving hardly any screen time to her actual work and using her paintings out of context...which is a shame, because the real story of this remarkable woman would have been just as dramatic if not more so."
2,Painful overacting,"While there were some redeeming qualities in this film, I was mostly struck by the painfully overly dramatic acting. I quit halfway through. I was disappointed in that because I love well-done foreign films about humane characters. This one failed, for me."
2,Much less than I expected,"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers that the film's inaccuracies hurt it's credibility. I also found the overall film quality ( art direction, costumes, etc. ) to be good but not great. However, I enjoyed the depiction of the tools and techniques employed by painters of that era.But perhaps the most offensive aspect of this film is the way in which it demeans woman artists. As someone who graduated from art school in the 1970's, I can attest to the the almost total neglect paid to the accomplishments of woman artists prior to the 1960's. One of the few exceptions that comes to mind is Mary Cassatt; and what credit she has been afforded is unfairly stigmatized by her "" woman's "" subject matter.I bought this DVD because I'm a painter, and I had incorrectly assumed that this was going to be a more accurate telling of her remarkable life story. Frankly, I wish I had seen it first; I would have spent my money elsewhere."
2,Pornograpic and not suitable for class viewing,"I have done extensive research for years concerning Artemisia Gentileschi, and I am always looking for new material to share with my college students when I teach the Baroque period and the lack of women visible during that time. I previewed the DVD when it was promptly received, and I found it totally unsuitable for college viewing; I might have even lost my job! The film was well done, the costumes were gorgeous, and the nudes were attractive!"
1,reject say's it all,This movie was not funny.It was stupd nothing in this moviemade me laugh.The only thing the movie made me do was tape overit.I wasted money on this movie and to tell you the truth theblair whitch project was funny compared to the blair whitchrejects.Don't waste time or money on this movie.
1,90 Minutes of annoying actors,"Don't let the ""Blair Witch"" comparison entice you into buying this film. Focus your attention on the ""Rejects"" part of the title. I know this is a spoof, but it's not even funny. Watching this film is like being trapped in a room with the 10 most annoying people you know for 90 minutes. The characters are sub-stereotypical, patently fake and unbelievable. The most frustrating part of the film is the fact that there never seem to be less than four people talking at the same time throughout the whole thing. One girl can't stop smiling even when she is supposed to act afraid. As for the hilarious surprise ending--if anyone finds it, please let me know because the only thing hilarious and surprising about this movie was the fact that I actually paid for it and wasted 90 minutes of my life watching it."
4,Where'd you get this guy?,"That's what I want to know! The sound guy was funny as hell. Is he really like that? Has he been in any other movies? The Blair Witch Rejects is weird and funny and I heard somewhere that there wasn't a script. If that's true, these actors have alot of talent! If it was scripted, the actors have to be really really good to pull off those lines. Either way I laughed alot. Monique Pierre as one of the assistants was hilarious. SHe reminds me of me (really sarcastic and charming). Her suitcase part was really great. The surprise ending make me snort milk out of my nose, so that wasn't very fun, but once I cleaned myself and the t.v. off, I was still laughing. Great movie!"
5,Why they call it Holly-weird,"I just read the horrible review this movie just got and I couldn't disagree more! ""Blair Witch Rejects"" is just what it's supposed to be: ridiculous, funny, mind-boggling and annoying. The way these 10 people interact is about as real as you can get. Show me one situation with 10 real people where only one of them talks at a time, and I'll show you a well-scripted bunch of actors. This movie is not about scripting or peace and tranquility. This movie is about a group of bumbling morons who pinball off each other as they all try to obtain their individual objectives. Let me tell you something: It takes alot of talent to act this insane! BRAVO to all the actors and to Jerry Vasilatos, the director! Worth every penny (if you're informed as to what you're buying, that is!)!"
4,Cheesy Hilarious Fun!,"My wife bought this tape for me knowing I love spoofs. I laughed so hard, I almost died! Director Jerry Vasilatos brought together a great ensemble cast, notably Brent Beebe as the Sound Guy. This guy is over-the-top and believable. It's hard to believe his performance wasn't scripted at all. Deborah Wolff, the Producer, was full of life and irritatingly hilarious! Mostly, the timing between Ms. Wolff and Kevin Leadingham, the Director (in the film) was wonderful and very entertaining. Watching this group of people bumble their way through slap-stick adventure was funny enough for me to rewind the tape and run it again that same night during a get-together with my friends!"
1,The .25 cents I paid for this movie was .25 cents to much!,"I bought this movie at a garage sale, it was in a box of VHS tapes marked $1.00 each! I loved the Blair Witch Project so I thought it would be fun to watch a take off on it. When I tried to give the lady a dallor for the movie she told me the movie was so bad that she would feel guilty charging me a dollar, so I got it for .25 cents it wasn't much of a bargan!"
4,Lighten Up Francis...,"I think Dark Genius needs to get out of his college library basement and loosen up lol... ""Rejects"" starts a little slow... but the characters have more personality than the ones in other ""Blair Witch"" spoofs and are pretty creative considering what I read here that they all improvised. Once they get to the forest and run into the other film crews it's pretty hilarious. I agree with the other reviewer that Brent the Sound Guy and Deborah the Producer were the standouts. This is definitely one not to take seriously... I recommend you pop it in on a Friday night with lots of friends, beer, pizza, and enjoy. I found they have a website through IMDB at blairwitch-rejects.com that spoofs the official ""Blair Witch"" site as well. Nice touch. Only other spoof I've seen that is as good on a different level is ""The Oz Witch Project"", I recommend it as well (I think their site is at ozwitch.com)."
2,Don't buy this printer !,"I bought the MFC-4350 at $399.0 in Office Depot one year ago. i am annoyed by it now, because: 1) its toner catridge is very expensive ($169.0), a toner cost $39.0. 2) ""600*600dpi"" print quality is not good, looks like 300*600. 3) its catridage life has only ~1000 pages, not the company said 2000~3000 pages! 4) the copy quality is not good, less than 300*300dpi I am thinking of how to get ride of it now!"
4,Important info about this set,"I just got this - it's four long interviews on five discs. NO lecture material. THIS IS AN INTERVIEW BOX.A friend of mine ordered this, same story, just the five discs.My guess is, they were going to include three bonus discs but couldn't get the rights, and it was too late to reprint the box.It's a good set. I especially enjoyed the autobiographical stuff in the first session. The material on General Semantics, ""model-theism"", and the Eight Circuits makes more sense in print (""Prometheus Rising""), and I didn't need an hour on Joyce and Pound, but this is an excellent intro to RAW's thought."
3,Great except for the deceptive advertising.,"The packaging claims to include the lectures Religion for the Hell of It, The Acceleration of Knowledge, and the New Inquisition, as part of a ""collector's edition"". The CDs DO NOT contain these lectures. Five CDs are in the package, as the package claims, but the lectures are not there.The interviews with RAW are excellent."
1,The Editorial Review is incorrect.,"It says:This Collectors Edition also includes three classic Robert Anton Wilson lectures: The Acceleration of Knowledge, The New Inquisition, and Religion for the Hell of It.That's completely untrue. The package only contains an interview with Mr. Wilson."
2,The book was great the Movie well.....,"The book was a great read but unfortunately the movie was a disappointment. I have expected the movie to be at the same lines as the book in the manners of suspense and thrill that were major driving elements in this masterpiece. Instead a caricature adaptation that spoiled the drama, adventure and more importantly the Reality which were felt through-out the book. I'd rather give NO stars but to be fair the style of acting deserves some respect therefore I rated it with two stars."
5,The best CEO's Movie,"Want to know what does ""Take Over"" means ???? Buy it and know it. Perfect for MBA's students."
2,Barbaric parody at the Gates,"The screen version of the book is nothing like the book in any manner, except for the characters and the plot. The movie lacks that serious business and glamorous edge that the book brings out. The movie summarises the story and shreds it almost to pieces. The movie rushes through the story in mock-comedy fashion as if the whole shinding was an episode of a comedy series. The book is about the power, greed, bravado and glory that emanated from Wall Street in the roaring '80s and shook the entire financial and business world in that era - globally. The movie misses that point by light years. It's a childish and vindictive parody of a great story. It's also pretends to be a ""Dummy's guide to LBO's in the 1980's"" when characters explain the salient points of LBO's. I hope another director/producer team will give this another bash and bring to the screen a real powerful and moving story based on this book."
4,Infamous LBO and Characters Interestingly Depicted,"In the wild and wooly 1980s, leveraged buyouts (LBOs) -- financed predominantly through the issuance of junk bonds -- reigned supreme. James Garner gives a nice performance as CEO of RJR Nabisco, F. Ross Johnson. After reluctantly meeting with KKR's LBO guru Henry Kravis (portrayed masterfully by Jonathan Pryce), Johnson figures it would be best to go his own route to accomplish the buyout; after all, Johnson wants to retain his autonomy and Pryce would unlikely allow this to happen.An all-out power war ensues, with Johnson working with Shearson Lehman Brothers pitted against Kravis and the powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert (mysteriously downplayed).The performances are great and the storyline moves fast and holds your interest. Not to be missed if the dynamic world of finance is your thing. A very different movie than Wall Street both cinematically and contextually.Stars James Garner, Jonathan Pryce (really, really good), and Peter Riegert."
4,Babarians At The Gate,"It took too long for this item to get to me even though I made an express shipping payment. However, the product quality is good."
3,"If you read the book, it's a disappointment.","If not, it can be funny even to laymen. Obviously, it's practically impossible to transfer everything from the book to movie. So don't expect too much, Wall Street guys."
4,If you thought the movie was good ...,"If you thought the movie was good, you should read the book. It is far better. While the movie certainly held my attention from start to finish, I can't help but feel that only those who had read the book and know the story would have really appreciated the movie and the events that took place that time. It seems so long ago. But it's still a great case study. KKR still lives!"
2,The creator of M*A*S*H wrote this?,"I was surprised to see Larry Gelbart wrote the screenplay of this unfunny movie. I can recall very few laughs in this film. The premise of the film is to highlight the greed of the 1980's, but the lesson is quite dated in the era of Enron and WorldCom. The greed here is apparent and at least honest and upfront, in contrast to the dishonesty and deception of some of the greed of the late 1990's. As for the message, I certainly don't think the shareholders of RJR Reynolds minded being courted so well. If I were a shareholder of a slumping company I'd be mighty grateful to live in a society where people have the freedom to pay whatever crazy price they want for my stock! James Garner is wonderful in this show, and the movie does a nice job of laying out the business concepts in terms your grandmother can understand. I do have to confess, however, to dozing a bit in the middle of this movie, so perhaps I missed the funny parts."
4,Excellent....reminds you of Marvin Gaye.,"WHUR-FM in DC is using the promo and playing both the title tune and ""Tranquility"" heavily in its ""Quiet Storm"" rotation and it's a knock-out...a throwback to the ""old school"". Whoever is marketing this talented brother is doing him a tremendous disservice by not releasing the CD in a timely fashion. We've been waiting 2 months!"
3,ankle support,The medium size is a little tight for my small feet. I wear shoe size 5W. I'd like a more symmetrical cut. Otherwise they are fine.
1,Don't buy,"Like 2 other posts, the pan popped out on the second knead cycle right out of the box. My excitement of my first homemade loaf was almost completely lost after 4 attempts to keep the pan in place. I went in search of troubleshooting recommendations and they all including jerry-riging the unit somehow. I don't think something right out of the box should need wires and pliers to keep the pan seated! Luckily I was able to salvage the dough. I let it rest for 2 hours, kneaded it myself and baked it in the oven. For what its worth it tasted good. I'll be using that christmas gift money towards a completely different brand."
4,Amazing photography,"This book is a great collection of some hands-down stunning photography. The copy may as well not be there as it almost detracts from the impact of the art the book is presenting. While it feels a bit outdated with 1988 as the latest examples shown, In Our Time, is still a neat book to look at."
3,Not as comprehensive as it should be,"If you are truely a beginner at gardening, this book would be ok but it seems to only scratch the surface. I've read other gardening books and have discovered and benefited more from them than this one. I know it's tempting to buy a book because it says that its for the beginner but in this case, I'd advise beginners to seek more comprehensive books on the topic. They may sound intimidating but in the end, they will make you a better gardener and work for you long after you've moved on from the beginner stage. I abandoned this book after I learned more."
4,Helpful and pretty to look at,"In true MS form, the book is lovely to look at and has some helpful ideas about gardening. Not a big book, but a valuable one for me."
5,Excellent hard case.,Excellent hard case for my video camera and accessories. Beautiful finish and great balance.
5,Great Solution Book for Stat Mech! Help is here!,"One of the biggest problems with Stat Mech, is that most folks I know (like me) don't have a good intuition for it. It's also one of those courses in which universities don't really hammer down, and have problems getting someone to teach it well, if at all. As painful as it might be, this book can help the graduate as well as the undergraduate student.Other books have LOTS of solutions (Garrod's and Kubo's come into mind), but it's this book, by Dalvit et al, actually explains, in some detail, the justifications for the steps in the solutions. Many instructors may not want you to use this book (it's tempting not to 'learn' when you can copy), but this book can actually compliment your learning of the material.A must for those having problems in Stat Mech, self-learners and beginners in this area."
5,Tasty Chai,"Great tasting chai. Easy to desolve it in hot water. Adds zing to coffee, too. I don't like cloves or allspice and, thankfully, can't taste any in this yummy brew."
2,Not what I ordered,I ordered the small packets NOT this big bag that will take forever to use and I have no where to store. Thank you.
3,Expensive and does NOT come with a scoop!,"I have read that the price listed on here is not the cheapest and it is true but it does have free shipping and since I buy often from Amazon, I thought to just go with them and pay the ""premium"". For that price, I was disappointed that there is no scoop in the package. I guess I should have kept the scoops from the cans that I used to buy from Big Train.. Silly me to assume that the bags from the same company will have the same scoop.Great taste, but expensive and no scoop so minus 2 stars."
1,Rip OFF,Big Train Chai is the BEST...But this 'SALE' is bogus. You can buy a 3.5lb bag at several other websites for around $18-$22. They make you think you're getting the bulk purchase of Four 3.5lb bags which you do not...so basically you're paying almost double for one 3.5lb bag.Don't buy from this company..On a positive note Amazon refunded our money...so five stars to Amazon....no stars to The Beverage Gourmet.
4,Nice inexpensive tripod,"Tripod appears to be as advertised. I wanted an inexpensive tripod for travel that could be used under rough conditions and if lost or stolen wouldn't ""break the bank"". This unit fits the bill. It has all of the basic features you would expect of a lightweight tripod and would be suitable for holding camera gear up to 8-10 pounds. At under 21"" in length, it is more packable than many other units on the market."
4,Great for the price,I just got these to keep out on the porch (we live out in the country & sometimes it's nice to see what the dogs are going off on or who's coming down the road). They turned out to be pretty well made & work well for $30 or so - as good as much more expensive binoculars.
1,Glad I read first,"I am glad I cam to this site, to read the reviews. I was so happy when I brought home my season 1 of Baywatch. But I soon discovered that it wasn't season one at all. After reading the reviews that it was really season 2, I took it back to the store and got my money back. Thank you to all of the reviewers out there. Now I am going to go the German Amazon site and buy yhem. At that site, season 1 is really season from the NBC network. Season 2, is the syndicated start of the series. And so on. They also have 9 seasons released. And not to worry, I am going to buy a region free DVD player on Bay. It will be worth it in the long run. I don't think I will be dissapointed going this route, but I will let you guys know what my outcome is. Thanks for the heads up you guys."
2,Disappointed.,"Buyers, take heed. The series has been altered.The series is indeed Baywatch, but they have taken out the opening song, ""I'm Always Here."" and closing song ""Current of Love"" both which were sung by David Hasselhoff.I was looking forward to seeing this series again. But am disappointed that the music was tampered with. It's like taking the opening music out of the series CHiPs, or any other series that has it's signature opening.And, as stated by other people, the seasons are being released out of order. And there are episodes missing.If you want the series Baywatch, just to have it. Then get these. However, if you want the series in it's entirety, music included, then I would wait until they release the series correctly.They need to go back to the drawing board on this one. :("
4,The First Season,I read on another review that the firstseason being released was not actuallythe first season. I read on anotherweb site that is was actually the firstseason. I also checked out Bestbuy's website since they also have and episodelist with each season set that you buy.They also have the orginal first season.I hope they are right because I really onlyliked the first 3 Seasons.
3,baywatch,"dear amazon, i always wondered how these male lifeguard could stay focus on the people swimming with all these sexy girl lifeguards everywhere. ouff! not an easy job. mom likes the show a lot, she says that guy david on the cover is a real men. i watched a few episodes with mom. i like that sexy girl lifeguard, mom says her name is erika eleniak. anyway, she makes me wanna go to this beach, drown and get rescued. maybe i could get some mouth to mouth. anyway, mom says you cant go swimming if theres no lifeguard. i guess people on that beach are lucky.your frind kent"
3,Baywatch Season I,Baywatch Season i and Season 2 are the same i need a return label to return Season 2. They have the same shows.
3,Baywatch Season 1,"If this was the correct seasons one this would of got a 5 star review. This is actually season two and season two is actually season three as ""Summer"" never joined Baywatch till season three. Also season one has ""Jill"" character as well as ""Craig"" Parker Stevenson and the famous shark episode where one lifeguard gets attack.I enjoyed the dvd however as the first three seasons were my favourite, would of liked season one to be the original though. Good to see Australia companies got it right. I've already pre-booked my order for the complete ""original"" season one."
2,disappointed,"I thought this DVD series would have the full season of season one, but it didn't. All of the early shows were not there. I will not buy any of the other seasons of baywatch."
3,Not the real characters,"Ok, I have always loved Baywatch, and watched it devotedly as a kid. Im not necesairly dissapointed with the show, but with the advertising. On the front of the box, you see 4 main characters that arnt even in this first season. In fact, I dont think they come onto the show for the next few seasons. Its fun to see this, but I was dissappointed I didnt see these characters"
1,"Blah, The Excitement is Gone, Don't Waste Your Money",Well according to what I am reading we are missing an episode from the DVD (Nightmare Bay) and all the music is replaced...So why bother? Is this really worth $20??? I can get over the music part but to cut off an entire episode...sign me up to NOT buy this. This is more of a -10 star set after all this.
3,Missing Episodes????,Okay - did anybody actually buy this thing & keep it? Because I got it & Season 2 & by the looks of it Eddie & Shauni's wedding is on NEITHER of them!!!! Same with that storm drain episode where Hobie (Jeremy Jackson) pulls that prank & Mitch yells at him for it later on. They showed clips of all this in the episode where Mitch almost dies because he free-style dived too deep - but I haven't seen them & Eddie & Shauni aren't in Season '2' so how the Heck am I to see their wedding!?!?!?!?! Or is their wedding in the REAL Season 1??? And has anybody else's DVDs skipped like a VHS tape would when the tracking is off??? Please Help!!!!!
1,NOT Season 1,"This is not the TRUE season 1,and like many others, I too am only interested in the first season as it aired on NBC. Thanks to the person who posted that amazon.co.uk has the actual season 1 for sale. I immediately went to their site and ordered it. If my current DVD player doesn't play the Region 2 DVDs, well, then I guess it's time to buy a new DVD player."
1,Baywatch Season 1,"""Baywatch Season 1"" had only one episode that was from season 1. The rest were made after season 1.JP"
3,Baywatch - Season 1,"It's too bad they didn't include all the episodes, but they don't even make the other episodes available. Notably missing is Shark Derby (Jill attacked by great white.)"
4,Southerns best,"The album is really jamming, there are a lot of other rappers on the CD that I really like, UGK, Big HAWK, South Park Mexican. The beats are hitting and the lyrics are slamming. This is the best one yet that I have heard from them."
2,Not very good as a toy or a snack.,"Let me start by saying I disagree with all the fuss over the danger. Children that are too young to know the difference should not be playing with small Legos in the first place. They would be a hazard with or without this candy. Conversely with this candy they would still not be a hazard to children of the appropriate age. Especially if they had experience with enough Legos to know the difference.That being said the quality is horrible. The bricks do not have holes on the bottom to allow for any connections. You open a package hoping to play with them only to be stopped dead in your tracks by their inability to link together. Without the appeal of being functionally Lego shaped all that you are left with is a gummi-type candy with an intense but bad flavor, with little flavor differentiation between the pieces."
4,"It's food, not toys!","This is an adorable idea that my kids will be enjoying at their 5th birthday, which is Lego themed. Since they were 2 my twins have had no problem differentiating between food and toys. Kids under 4 shouldn't have small Legos anyway. If your kids think they can eat real Legos, they're not ready to play with them. Choking issue solved. LOVE THESE SNACKS!"
1,Worst.Idea.Ever,"Could you think of a worse thing to make into a yummy snack? How about thumbtacks? Don't eat this little square...it'll kill you. Eat this one, it's yummy! I know they look exactly the same, but you're a smart kid. I await the first lawsuit. Amazon, please pull these."
1,Somebody Please Sue Kellogg Before Children Choke to Death,Why would Kellogg make candy that looks like Legos?What will happen when children assume that all Legos are edible?When will the choking deaths begin?Would some lawyer out there please sue them premptively to end this bad idea before it goes any further?
2,not worth the effort,"While the map itself is excellant, getting it and getting it in a timely manner was not. I ordered this product 2 months before our trip to France and received it 6 weeks after we returned. I tried to return it and was met with roadblock after roadblck. I finally gave up and donated it to the local high school French teacher. My recommendation about ordering things via this process from out of the country is that it is not worth the effort. The 2 stars ratings is for the product not the process of getting it."
5,Quite an exquisite book!,"This book describes magic well. I think everyone should enjoy this book! If you like orgres, or dogs, it would be an exciting bok for you"
5,Empty Sky by Elton John,Empty SkyThis was my first Elton John record in the 1970s' and I think it's his best. I have it on Vinyl and C.D. Give it a listen and find the music consume you. You will enjoy it no doubt in my mind.
5,Excellent,"This is one of the better books on China that I've read. I lived in Beijing for two years, and feel that, unlike Kristoff and Dunn in China Wakes, Mike Chinoy really understands China and what makes this most mysterious country tick. And like Jan Wong in Red China Blues, he goes through a transition of being gung-ho on Maoism to seeing the reality of the situation in China. This is one of the things that makes both books so believable. As I am a journalist, I also can appreciate the red tape he went through to get the story out. Chinoy also does an excellent job of describing the Tian'anmen massacre -- one of the better descriptions I've read. I really recommend this book. It's excellent!"
4,The Beat Mechanics Kick Ass,"There is only one way to describe The latest CD from the Beat Mechanics: Awesone! The Beat Mechanics are an amazingly talented band. The lyrics on the album are moving, powerful, and touchingly honest. Definitely a welcome break from the typical wannabe rock band today: (...)The songs are all well-written and easy to relate to. The tunes are catchy and ear-pleasing like NYC Blues. All in all, this CD is definitely one of my favorites, and definitely at the top of my gift list!"
4,CodeWarrior Pro 6.0,CodeWarrior is a nice compiler and integrated development environment. My only complaint is the lack of documentation. Information on how to use their API's is hard to find.
1,Junk,"When I pulled this tripod out of the box I was all set to come here and give it a glowing review. It seemed very sturdy and I really thought it was a fantastic deal. That was three days ago. Since then, I have used the tripod only a few times. Today, I was photographing some trees. When I was done I went to lower the head. I turned the crank and everything was fine until the head was about 2 inches from the base. Then the crank made an ugly grinding sound and little bits of plastic fell out from the base. The crank no longer does anything, it just spins around freely and the head is stuck at the position.I'm going to have to buy a new tripod after only 3 days of light use."
5,My 1st Tripod And I LOVE It At 68 Years Of Age!,"I Bought This One Online Kmart.com $[...] Plus $[...] Shipping & Sales Tax..I Could NOT Believe My Eyes When I Took It Out Of The Box!! The QUALITY-CONSTRUCTION-COLOR-Ease Of Use, Its All There! You Will NOT Be Dissapointed With This One! I've Seen Them Online From $39 Up!! By The WayIt Raises To 63 3/4"" NOT 65"" If This Is A Problem For You!I Install ""Cosmic"" Ceilings & Walls & My Star Theater Projector Will Fit The Camera ""Shoe"" By Installing A 8X10 Plexiglass Platform & Some Duct Tape! Gets Me Within 3 Ft Of The Ceiling!"
2,Cheap,"Don't expect a nice product for $25, the tripod does not look very solid (made in China). The bubble is pretty useless because it is not very precise (up to 5 degrees of angle it won't detect it). The head is very inaccurate, when on the horizontal rest position, it has a 3 degrees error (which means you have to correct it by slightly raising one side). I would have expected a level position when on the rest.I sent back my tripod presto and I will save a little bit more to buy a used Bogen/Manfrotto tripod on eBay (they can be found at ~$80 with head).Don't waste your money on these cheapo tripods."
3,"Some outstanding sections, but an average book","Having read Adiele's essay in The Best Women's Travel Writing of 2005, I was disappointed in the structure of her book. The side page commentaries were distracting and sometimes didn't match the page they were on. The book contained a lot of factual journal entries but very little depth of insight or application to her life for the future. I found some flashback memories to 'prior to ordination' not attached to the context of that chapter. Some good writing, some good story telling. The book didn't live up to the section chosen for the book mentioned above. Kay Klinkenborg, Springfield, IL"
2,Disappointing,"This book was a disappointment for me. Firstly, the notes on the margins of this book made the reading dis-jointed and irritating, as if you were reading a magazine article and not a book. Secondly, the main narrative was disjointed as well, jumping back and forth in time as if building suspense in a detective story or some high-brow literature. Yet, this is meant to be a memoir of a Buddhist nun.Mmh, maybe this pretentious(?) writing-style has something to do with the motivation of the author to take ordination: At some point she confesses that one motivation for getting ordained was that it would later serve her as a good conversation starter at a cocktail party. Sorry, can it get anymore shallow?I would have loved to read more about the Thai forest temple but I am not sure I can finish this book"
1,All Fact?,"Frankly, having skimmed through this book, I wonder whether all information written by the author is fact or fiction after reading about her childhood. For example, the author should ask individuals in her hometown in Washington State for their permission before slandering them in this book. Doesn't she realize she's not the only black person living in Sunnyside--there was another black family living in Sunnyside at the same time when she was there. They made great strides in school sports. Also, the reader has never heard of a certain individual trying to jockey with Ms. Adiele to be the number one Minority Smarty-pants individual and having designs on a Cheryl. Didn't realize there was a contest like that going on. It must be all in her head."
5,One of the Best of the Inventors' Specials,"The premise of this story about a runaway who runs into Thomas Edison's lab sounded, well, not that good. After watching it, it was apparent a lot of thought went into this story and it works very well. From what I have read of Edison he is portrayed in this dvd as he really was. Also recommended from the Inventors Specials are Marie Curie More Than Meets the Eye and Newton A Tale of Two Isaacs. The Edison dvd is a favorite of the Inventor Specials because it shows the influence Edison had on this young person's life later as an adult."
4,chubedelicious,"Catchy lyrics and a funky beat. Flatbacker is an auto-repeat tune recommendation--even more enjoyable if you can pin down the refrain. The album features a good mix of style and talent. To truly enjoy the genre, you need to see their show. Check out their website and sample the music at http://www.chub.com/index.html"
2,The Seller could have done better,"I have had the product in use for over 10 years. I works just fine but shows aging. I ordered two. One had no defects. The second had black stains on the surface. I had to use different products to remove the stains. After two hours of cleaning, a small trace remains. The Seller should not have sent the second unit. Their action puts a poor rating on a good faucet."
4,not what i was expecting,"I love the poster, but it wasn't what I was expecting because of the backlight reactive flocked"" that's the only thing I dislike about it..but overall it was my fault for misreading it.."
2,Misleading DVD cover.,"Forget the nifty cover photo. It's in the movie for approximately 10 seconds and has little (nothing) to do with the rest of the film. Promoted as a movie about UFO sightings and messages from beyond, the endlessly rambling plot eventually gets around to the real message. I don't want to spoil it, but you deserve to know, it's a religious film. Even if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere."
1,does not work with win xp,"If you have a newer computer, the MP-21c will not work with Win XP. The drivers supplied by Brother will only support parallel printing, even though the printer does not have a parallel port. This forces you to buy a...cable and AC adapter from Brother, negating the convenient one-cable setup via the PCMCIA card.Feeds single sheets only; a sheet feeder is an additional [cost]. It is as large as the printer itself.Brother's customer support is awful.Avoid this one and look to the Canon BJC-85.My experiences only; caveat emptor."
1,MP21C Portable Printer,"In one word the printer is "" [bad]"", I would not touch another Brother Printer again- having said that- when I tried to get it serviced I was totally disapointed with there approach. In short I got no Technical support at all with the printer being returned in the same condition that it was sent in. My advise is forget Brother Printers because if you have a problem then you are on your own."
2,too flat & too hard,These pillows were too flat and the centers too hard for my taste. I pefer the more conventional style with softer fills and higher fluff.
2,Good for the hard-headed,"We found these pillows to be too hard, unhuggable. They are okay in a sham or used underneath a soft, fluffy pillow just to give height."
3,Meh,"These are good quality for what they are, but the problem I have with them is the look. What you can't really tell from the picture, is that the part of the cap that is flared out is basically transparent, with the center part that goes all the way through being darker. The effect is that they look like toy doll eyes. White circles with dark centers. They look pretty weird.I do like that they are of good build quality though. I would just prefer the whole cap to be the same color."
2,Racing and Collecting Slot Cars,"If your into 1/32 scale, I guess it would be fine. If your into h.o. scale, the book has nothing to offer. there is only one chapter (four pages) on H.O. and it is not good. [...]"
3,"Good Treatment, but an ego trip","As with his books on Model Railroading, Mr. Schleicher writes in an unfortunate style. He certainly knows what he is talking about, but that is not the problem. He writes as if he invented the hobby; for example his comments on page 9 as to his books being ""part of the history of the hobby."" It's annoying, but the book is full of good information nonetheless. It might not bother others, it's just that I've also experienced his opinionated style when modeling trains. All in all, the book is useful, if for no other reason than it's the only up-to-date treatment of the hobby I've seen."
3,A bit superficial for me,I'm 62 and just getting back into slot car racing with my 40 yearold Revel set. This book is nice and if your are looking for some interesting track layouts for various home set tracks. But it is missing a lot that can easily be found on the internet.
4,They Are The Sultans,"Okay, while it's been transferred from video to DVD it's not super HD. But what it does show is an early Dire Straits in their pre-arena phase. Good songs, good dynamics - but don't expect the Brothers In Arms era type concert. Nice to hear the early stuff in the period. A must have for straits fans"
3,You Can Do Better Than That,"When I pick up a book on the oral history of the Navy SEALs, I expect a book about the SEALs, or at least stories from SEALs. That is NOT what this book is. It is more a collection of stories from members of UDT as they were being phased out and SEALs were coming in, some of whom became SEALs, many of whom did not. It should have included more interviews from people who started with the SEALs, as well as those who switched to SEALs from UDT so as to present a more balanced approach to the story. At least, that is what I would have preferred to see. However, the book was by no means a failure. The stories of the men interviewed were well worth purchase price. But the book really could have focused more on the stories of SEALs as opposed to UDT."
3,Stinko Ginkgo,"I've been using various brands of Ginkgo, and for the most part, this brand seems okay. The reason I gave it three stars is because these tablets have an awful smell. They also start to melt in your mouth and the taste is every bit as alarming as the odor. My mother in-law asked ""What are those for?"", I said it improves memory -- her response was ""I'd rather loose my memory than have to take that!"" If your looking for an good ginkgo extract, try Nature's Way Ginkgo Gold. They're pretty good and the tablet is coated, no order and no taste."
1,Truly stinks!,"Not only does this product smells really bad, and I mean really bad, it leaves an aweful aftertaste. I tried taking this for a week, and felt sick to my stomach each and every single time. I opted for the Walgreens version."
4,Replacement for Dr. Weils,Seems to have same effect as the Dr. Weil's (which is off the market - per their CS they are looking for a new supplier). Minus a star as the taste is really horrible (as is all the Ginko- the Weil formula was a powder in a capsule so there was no bad taste.). I'll order it again.
2,"cute, but that's about it...","These shoes are cute, yes. But they are rather poorly made and not even of the quality of say, the Keds brand. Also, the colors don't exactly go together. The striped band is very dark/vibrant colors, while the print upper of the shoe is done in muted, nearly pastel colors. It is quite offbeat in appearance and difficult to match."
4,A Solid piece of history,"Old, but good. A diverse and excellent mix. worth owning if you are a fan of vintage electronica, hip-hop, mashups, etc."
3,"Good remote, but lacking","It controls my TV and my DirecTV, but not my DVD player/VCR combo player. The manual lists codes for 11 DVD/VCR brands, but not mine. It doesn't make sense that they would leave Phillips off the list."
2,Doesn't really work with everything,"I purchased this remote to control my TV, DVD player, and DirectTV box. We needed this because we lost our original TV remote and couldn't use the sleep timer. It controls the TV as it should. However, I could not get it to sync with my DirectTV box despite trying ALL the codes included with the instructions. Also, it did sync with the DVD player, but doesn't control most of the functions. Be weary if you need this remote to control all features!"
4,Basic But Sturdy Monopod - Recommended,"I was in the market for a sturdy monopod that could also serve as a walking stick for light trail use. The Vanguard MP-15 fits the bill fairly nicely with the following observations:Pros:Inexpensive compared to similar monopodsVery solid constructionVery sturdy camera mountCons:Pan and tilt handle too close to grip when folded downAttached ""foot"" does not provide much added stabilityAll-in-all, I am very pleased with this monopod.Recommended!CFH"
1,It's dangerous to camera's,"Perhaps it's my fault, but my brand new camera fell off and was totally destroyed. I thought it was secure, but it only seemed to be. I'm not pleased with it at all. The mounting is clumsy. I am very unhappy this morning."
2,Disappointing and not well designed,"I just received this monopod as a gift and I am very disappointed. I tighten the quick shoe with a coin but my camera does not stay tightly attached to the monopod if you move the camera at all. To tighten the quick shoe again you have to release the shoe and then get out a coin and try again to tighten the screw. I don't think the quick shoe is saving any time, its increasing the time involved and very frustrating. Also a good quick shoe should indicate on the shoe where the front of the camera/lens should be and also indicate it on the positioning spot on the monopod.The handle is in the way most of the time. It appears to be well made and lightweight but the controls are not well thought out and its so annoying I am going to go back and use my old brocken down monopod that just has a screw on top so you just turn the monopod to screw it on...its much faster."
3,fine for light cameras,"I bought this unit to use w/ a D30, extra battery case and a 100-400 prime lense, the unit is well put together but can't handle the weight(especially the link between the ""detachable base"" and the pod (it's plastic and will rock back and forth w/ the heavy lense/camera combo) would be great for a lighter application."
1,Complete waste,"I saw this book while searching for search engine optimization books, and this one came up as one of the recommended books. Yes, I may have not been the right audience, but this would apply to everyone.The title should be changed to ""Fit for the garbage can in 30 seconds or less."" My god, if you have ever done 10 or more searches on Google (which almost everyone has), you'll find this book absolutely useless. You can get more information by simply visiting this page http://www.google.com/about.htmlI have nothing against the author or publisher, but thought I'd do this system justice by giving my honest opinion."
2,What A Shame....,"I'm going to make this review short and simple. Have you heard about how Amorphis turned from good metal to almost industrial? Well its kind of the same story here. Even though Bethlehem's albums were never as good as their ""Dark Metal"" album (which if any of you reading this see that album, get it and get it now for it is one of the best albums I ever heard), they were never as bad as this one. Oh, one more thing. Despite the fact that they sold out, I still can't bare to insult them by saying their music is Gothic Rock. Ugh!"
1,not happy,so upset about this watch.. it broke the second day I had it! the little metal part that holds the face of the watch and the wrist part of it came out and the watch fell right off my wrist!
5,I should invest in McCormick spices,For years I've bought much fennel from McCormicks at my supermarket...paid as much as $3.50 for 3.0 oz of product...bought 1 lb for less that $10.00 !you do the math...
4,Track Listing:,Minneapolis based band. Track listing: 1. Pay Attention To Me Now2. Mr. J.P.3. Siberia4. Lizards/(I Hate My) Left Hand5. The Lounge Piece6. Fill My Shoes7. Scratch That Jerk8. Bad Choice9. Tempt Me10. Lime and Lace11. False Misinterpretations12. Venom Lane13. Rustlin' of the Nose Hairs/Plans for the 90s14. Gobbin' on Life
2,Rosie the Riveter - dud!,"Women working during WWII is an interesting subject; however this book turns an interesting subject into a dry, uninteresting tale. I hope other author's explore this topic. I am very disappointed in this book."
5,Wonderful instruction.,"This has an excellent drawing/illustration of a sphere and the light and shadows on it. Overall, it's an excellent book that explains the technical aspect of drawing the realistic textures. It tells what hardness/softness of pencils to use, when to use charcoal and when to use graphite and when to layer the two, how to blend and which blending tool to use, using real texture, making indents in the paper, using masking mediums. The first two chapters cover materials and techniques. The last two show how to apply materials and techniques in demonstrations/exercises. The drawings have captions telling what techniques and pencils were used and lines connect the appropriate caption to the appropriate part of the drawing."
4,realistic drawing,"Have not completed the book yet but am happy with the info I've read so far. Since I love drawing realistic, I know that I will enjoy learning new techniques from this author and hope to some day take a workshop from him."
5,What is art? This book has the answer!,"I bought this book for my daughter's 5th birthday. She enjoys a variety of art forms in a variety of mediums yet she did not comprehend the fact that singing, dancing, banging on a drum, creating a collage, exploring play dough, creating a block structure, and ""writing"" are all forms of art. After reading this multicultural book, she has a better understanding of art. She now understands that art is more than crayons and paint. She now has a better understanding of creative expression across children of many cultures. The book is an ""easy read"" for parents and teachers yet can foster more in-depth conversations when needed. I will be sharing this book with my daughters preschool teachers."
3,Practical,"This book offered practical advice for women concerning depression, the symptoms, and the treatments, but I found it difficult to just sit down and read straight through this book. I was able to skim through it and pick out information, but I believe that Sisters of the Yam and Willow Weep for Me were easier to read and offered advice in a contextual form."
4,The truth about Black women and Depression.,"It's about time someone talked about it, instead of sweeping it under the rug, as it was seldomly done in the past."
5,"THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM, REGGAE MUST BUY.","YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN OPEN MIND FOR ""THE EEK"", THIS IS GOOD MUSIC TO LISTEN TO WHILE DRIVING,CHILLING WITH FRIENDS,FOR A PARTY, OR GETTING IRIED, IVE TRIED TO INTRODUCE EEK A MOUSE TO PEOPLE,AND IVE HAD MIXED REACTIONS,SOMETIMES ITS HIS STYLE OF SINGING THAT TURN THEM ON OR OFF, BUT NONETHELESS ITS GOOD LISTENING,TAKE A CHANCE ON THIS ALBUM,AND SEE HIM LIVE,CANT STRESS THAT ONE ENOUGH.-PEACE."
5,The Mouse Rulez!!!,Skidip! is a must have for any EEK-A-MOUSE fan. This album is one of his early albums and its Reggae Rhythms are great.
3,Holiness is Right!,"I thought the CD was good but I am from the old school and clearly somethings on the CD just sounds to worldly to me. Also, I watched the video and thought it was a bit much as well. However, what got my attention about their music is the worship songs that was on it. I just pray that God will enlighten folk about being different and separated from the world. ""For we are a peculiar people..."" It seems that these guys still have that worldly fashion about themselves and should have just stayed a go-go band. I will support you in your efforts to find Christ and hope that you really sell out and sell all to Him. Further, as black men you need the encouragement, just try to show more separation from the world and more holiness. Be blessed!"
1,Citizen Scientist,"No, I am not a scientist but I am literate. I don't want products I use to cause me cancer. Fruit of the Earth? More like, 'they don't provide health insurance.' I'm sure this company hires chemist who could think of more natural ingredients to use. I will NEVER buy this product again, but thanks for encouraging me to grow my own aloe plants. I liked this product, but not some of the ingredients, and I know you can do better."
2,it doesn't really help,"This doesn't really help. it may helps for a few minutes but it will stop and the pain will come back. i have been using this products for a week now,2 times a day and it does not work. it leaves the green stuff on skin and its hard to get off your skin. i don't recommend this product."
1,I have no use for a misleading product/company,"I think it's bad enough that the label says 100% Gel when it's not, but even the description gave no indication of the added ingredients. As soon as the bottle came and I saw its clear contents, I knew it was not what I was looking for as pure aloe is not clear. Many people seem to like this product, but it needs to be labeled properly. Shame on me for not reading the reviews, I guess."
5,This is the best,"I love this product. I've used the 100% gel for several years as an after shaving moisturizer for my face. It leaves your skin feeling clean, cool, and healthy. This particular bottle size (24oz) is an excellent value."
2,OK for external topical use; avoid for internal use,"On the topic of whether this can be taken internally: If you read what it actually says on the bottle, it says ""100% Gel."" Yes, that is true. It is 100% gel. Nothing but gel in there.But the gel is not 100% aloe vera. Of course, don't take any aloe vera internally unless it is 100% aloe vera.Externally, the stuff does the job, although I would have preferred it to be 100% aloe vera even for external use. The other ingredients tend to counteract the aloe vera and have a drying effect."
2,Very misleading,"Even though this is marketed as 100% aloe vera gel it is not. According to the ingredients it is: Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Gel, Triethanolamine, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Carbomer 940, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea. There is some unhealthy stuff in there.Remember any garbage can be marketed as 100% anything but the ingredients have to be a little bit more accurate."
1,Grossly Misleading Labeling,"Although not technically a lie, putting 100% in the label is grossly misleading considering all the additives in this product. Personally, I consider it criminally misleading. Although I have bought a lot of this product in the past when it was less adulterated, I'll never buy any Fruit of the Earth Product again.I recommend ""Aloe Vera Gelly"" produced by ""Lily of the Desert"".Thanks to the reviewers below who described the chemicals."
5,The best none organic aloe vera gel!!!!!!!!,"I use 10+ brands of aloe vera gel and find out this is the best one. I disagree some of the reviewers saying too much chemicals in this aloe vera gel. Compare to many other brands it's the most less chemicals aloe vera gel in none organic class. Of course, if you have extra money you can go for organic that's better. Please forget about 100% pure aloe vera gel this word because there are no pure aloe vera gel in the market even for organic aloe vera gel. It must have some preservative!!It's hard to find in my local store now. All replace by other cheap brand with red/green/blue color and funny smell. I use this for many years. It helps my skin a lot. I would recommend to anyone needs aloe vera gel!"
5,Perfect for Hair,"I have used this for years for a setting gel for my hair. It might feel sticky when it is first put on the hair, but after my hair is set and dried, it is soft, plus it holds the hair set the next day."
4,Can't get enough,This product works great for my family. We use it to make our natural hair products. Great hold without crunch or flake. I only rated it 4 stars because I recently found it in Walmart. So I would probably shop there next time.
5,Arrived as exptected,Bought this item because I heard it was good for razor burn. It arrived quickly. The pump dispenser makes it easy to use. Large bottle for a good price. No complaints whatsoever.
1,Stings on cuts!!,"So, I recently had scarification work done- I have a network of artistic cuts on my arms now. They've been a little extra sore today, so after my shower I ran some of this gel over the work. OWWW!! Scarification care includes chemical irritation & exfoliation, to encourage the scarring, and it can be pretty painful. Let me tell you, this aloe gel burns MUCH worse than dousing my cuts in alcohol!! I can't speak to moisturization, hair gel or sunburn, but this is a big NO for cuts! Not to mention what everyone else has- definitely not pure aloe vera!"
5,Fabulous Hair Gel,"This is hands down the best hair gel I have ever used. I have naturally curly hair, and have tried most mousses, gels, and curl creams there are out on the market. Nothing compares to 100% Aloe Vera gel! It activates my curl without leaving my hair greasy or crunchy. I get compliments weekly on my hair and I really owe a large part to this product. For ppl with curly hair, try scrunching your hair with the gel after you get out of the shower and diffusing it. You won't believe the results. It's also great for touch ups throughout the day."
1,Don't Buy This,"I ordered this thinking by the name and the label it was pure Aloe Vera gel. I plan to return it. Fruit of the Earth ruined a perfectly good product,it is not 100% aloe vera gel. It has Tetrasodium EDTA, an ingredient Ralph Nader once said he wouldn't even touch with gloved hands. It is a penetration enhancer that increases the absorption rate of carcinogens, and can be a skin irritant. There is a reason the bottle says not to ingest it and keep out of the reach of children. Leave mother nature alone Fruit of the Earth. Just put a natural preservative in the Aloe gel, that's all you need. I'm going to go back to Aubrey Organics.Google ""tetrasodium edta"" and harmful"
3,cost less than $3 at walmart!!!!,"you guys know that you can buy this for wayyyyyyy cheaper at any local convenience store, right? don't spend a lot of money on such a cheap and easy to find product. random fact: its AMAZING for naturally kinky hair. and super curly hair too, i guess. its better than styling gel because it's very moisturizing and won't make your hair sticky and stiff. i also suggest mixing it with oils (jojoba, evoo, coconut, grapeseed, etc) it works wonders!!"
1,Terrible Shipping - Nice Item,"This is a nice gift for someone who has everything. The problem is with Shoppers Choice. It has taken almost a month to receive this. The communications from Shoppers Choice were horrible - first they had it in stock, then they didn't. The email updates were erroneous. In fact, I finally received the pkg. today and just received an email telling me they would be shipping it within 1-2 days (about the third time I have received this email. I would advise not to use Shoppers Choice for anything especially if you want your item in a timely manner!"
4,great investment (cost/benefit),- the compression clamps work well whenpoles are extended (during frequent use)- the leveling bubble is reliable for price- the plastic components have performedbetter than I first anticipatedPROs- a surely competent apparatus for beginners- cost/benefit pays for itselfCONs- nothing that you would expect of a $20 tripod
5,The Tripod Master Piece,"This handy dandy tripod is great for my flip camera, stable secure and can pan and tilt effectively I love it while doing my holistic shows, it has a built in level that you can adjust it correctly on uneven surfaces. All in all a great working piece of equipment."
1,Sad,"Flimsy (wobbles and feels like it will bend over) with camera on it, fluid head but the so cheap it jerks, making the fluid head worthless. Sad that a company would waste the resources to make such a useless product, and Amazon would sell it (and waste my time) ."
3,Fun for the whole family,"We enjoyed watching this movie recently with our kids (ages 7 and 10), there is quite a bit of foul language in the movie, so be forewarned if considering this one for your kids."
2,Not for kids!,"Definitely not for kids, maybe teenagers. There's explicit sexual situations in the first 10 minutes of the film.We had to stop it .... disappointing, since it's actually kinda funny."
1,some funny physical humor,"Rather strange mix. Funny Jim Carrey but unneeded raunchy, bawdy humor that was not needed seemed to dominate the plot line."
3,Big hands only!,"This thing is great for my husband, but I can't use it because my fingertips end about half way into the glove! Which makes it near impossible for grabbing anything out of the oven.Keep this in mind if you have small hands. Maybe someday they will make these in different sizes."
2,The lesser of two evils,"I decided to replace my worn, cloth oven mits with these because they were getting worn and so thin that they no longer protected my hands from heat, especially wet heat and spills.Now, I've only used these silicone mits twice, but so far I am underwhelmed. I find them extremely unwieldy and inflexible. I didn't realize they were quite as thick as they are.Having said that, I think I will probably get more used to them. They have performed as expected in the realm of insulation and that was my big complaint with cloth mits. I guess I traded for the lesser of two evils here."
1,"If zero stars was a choice, I would give this zero stars!!","I purchased 2 mitts hoping that after receiving them, I would not have to be washing my potholders and oven mitts every other day! However, these silicone mitts have been thrown into a pile with every other thing I don't use because they are too stiff and very unmanageable to work with! You are wasting your money if you purchase these mitts!"
1,To cumbersome,Waterprrof? Yes. Heatproof? Yes. But hey are to stiff and awkward to use. I do not recommend.
3,Pretty but not that practical,"Since we've tried and really liked other silicone cooking aids, we had high expectations. In the end, we were disappointed. It's cool but is actually a bit awkward and slippery to use, whether your hand is tiny (like mine) or huge (like my husbands). Have had much better experience with standard insulated fabric types."
2,Advanced but hard to use.,"Both my partner and I had a hard time getting used to this extra thick, poorly felixible mitt. It is true that you cannot feel any heat but you also cannot feel the dish or pan that you are trying to hold which made us feel that the item would slip out of our hand. Our friends seemed to like them so they have it now!"
2,Still too big...,"Compared to the original sized Orka mitt, this 11"" size fits my finger length better. However, it is still cumbersome to use because Orka did not make the thumb of the mitt shorter. A similar product that feels better to me is the oven mitt made by Silicone Zone. The Silicone Zone oven mitt is made with a more pliable material and has a right and left hand mitt. I like the Silicone Zone oven mitts much better. Now, if only amazon.com would start selling it, that'd be great."
2,Nice idea with poor follow through,"I received the Orka as a Christmas present last year. I was excited to use it but I was quickly dissappointed after I did. Yes, you can pick up some really hot stuff with this oven mitt, but there is also a good chance you'll drop some hot stuff as well. Unfortunately, the design of the mitt forces your thumb to be uncomfortably across from the rest of your fingers, not next to your fingers as it normally sits. This aspect along with the fact that the thumb and fingers are held in a rigid position make it difficult to pick up items, especially heavy items. I don't know about you, but something that makes it difficult to pick up hot, heavy items doesn't belong in my kitchen. I just don't think its safe."
5,An Amazing Mitt,"My wife and I received this oven mitt as a wedding gift. At first look and feel the rubbery mitt made me think, ""No way we're using this, it'll will melt to my hands!"" But it only takes a couple of uses to show how significant of an improvement this unconventional mitt is. I've scraped melted pizza cheese off the oven rack at 400 degrees with this mitt no problem! Boiling water, hot grease, melted cheese, whatever! Nothing can get to your hands in this mitt!!!!Makes a great, weird... er... uh... unconventional, wedding gift!"
4,"Goofy but Works Even on Hot Grill Grids, Easy to Clean","I have just ordered the second one on Amazon after buying the first locally... looked really silly, but this standard-sized (hence 4 instead of 5 stars) mitt works as advertised (I think up to 650 degrees now? Was listed as good to 500 degrees when I bought the first one.) How many oven mits do that?! Fit my medium-to-large women's hands fine. I was able to adjust grate while gas grill on, and handle shish-kebab skewers as they were cooking and move and readjust... and the gloves did not stain, in fact they washed on top rack of dishwasher... lots cleaner than my (much prettier! but poorer performing) cloth ones, including my cherished Pampered Chef cream fuzzy ones. The lower rating is because I wish it were a couple of inches longer, like the extra-long Pampered Chef oven mitt. (It of course also does not make my kitchen more of an accessorized ""House Beautiful"" fashion statement..but it sure works!)"
5,Whale Of An Oven Mitt!,"I have used the Orka Silicone Oven Mitt for almost two years and think it's absolutely great. It's been well used for cooking, baking and grilling and still looks like new. My hand is of medium size for a guy and I have no trouble lifting anything with the glove. I think it would make a great gift for campers. A burn at home is bad enough but even worse when you're away camping. That would definitely ruin the best of camping times. Using the Orka will safeguard your hands and arms from burns both at home and on a camping trip. I've used it to retrieve a spoon in boiling water without being burned. Another handy camping/picnic item is the Towel Trekker. ~ The Boss"
1,Not what I expected.,This product is not 18/10 stainless steel. I received it this morning and it says 18/0 which will corrode a lot easier. If you are looking for 18/10 do not buy this product.
5,Beautiful,The set looks as advertised. They are a pretty set of flatware and I enjoy using them. They take up much less space in the drawer and in the dishwasher than the chunkier flatware we had before.
2,A bit disappointed.....,I was disappointed with the flatware service set. It took absolutely forever to receive then I find it rusts extremely easy. Not worth the price in my opinion.
5,Very nice,We're very happy with these. They're hefty and don't look nearly as cheap as they are. Also stylish and hard to bend. Really great value.
4,review over mathematical foundations of quantum statistics.,"this book explains several topics of this classical subjet in a modern way. It begins whit a brieffly introduction to the physic problem, in order to introduce the mathematical problem."
2,Originality stops with the fabric!,"Was disappointed in the book. It should have been titled Thirty Two Projects for Beginners. I found nothing new or very creative or innovative, which, since they used Kaffe Fassett's fabrics, is what I expected."
3,Like horror books? You might like this one,"If you are looling for a light Futuristic Romance this is not the book for you.I gave this book three stars because to do less would not be fair to the author. Christine Michels is good at what she does, and that's tell a good story. She is very detailed about every aspect of her story. She is so detailed that I found myself skipping over quite a bit of it. It was just not what I was looking for in a romance story.Is there a romance in the book? Yes, if you can get through the demons and all the horror that is going on all around the two people trying to find love. The romance of this story gets lost all too often. The book is dark!Like Steven King, you just might like this one. If you are not into Steven King, do yourself a favor and save your money. This book is not for you."
1,Not for me,"WIth this book I should have read the other readers reviews. This is a true Sci-Fi book. I only read about 35% on my Kindle and I quit. There were a couple of kisses( up to the point I read) and that was it. I was disappointed . I love Sci-Fi/alien romances, but this book did nothing for me.The first few chapters started off really good and went down hill after that.Don't get me wrong the author was very detailed but it dragged on. I suppose after reading Evangeline Anderson's Bride of the Kindred series I got spoiled. Those books I could not put down. So if your looking for something other than the werewolf/vampire reads. Try The Brides of the Kindred series."
3,Make sure it is the lube and not the drive belt,"I gave an average rating as I haven't used this product yet.I had a similar situation, but after looking at the first review, I was hesitant about buying this product, so I did a little more investigation. It paid off as I found the drive belt from the motor to the drive roller was lose. After tightening it up, the treadmill worked fine. If the front roller doesn't turn when you step on the treadmill, then your drive belt is lose and not the walking belt. It is unfortunate that the treadmill manuals don't go into further troubleshooting procedures instead of just saying, 'tighten the walking belt' or use 'Performant Lube' only.I'm planning on buying this product for yearly maintenance to keep down wear and tear."
1,Avoid,"Only good thing about this lube is that it won't violate most warantees. But it's messy, almost impossible to apply correctly, and you get very little per tube. Opt for after market lubes with better application options."
1,Very disappointed!!,"I am sorry to say that I am very disappointed in the cost and the shipping technique. I received a very small flat plastic tube with very little oil in it, one was broke due to the way it was packed. Nothing like the picture and for the price of the item I was shocked!! Paying $5.00+ for shipping and handling on an item that small and got broken in the process very disappointed indeed!! Be warned this is a very small packet of lube and will only maybe lube your treadmill once. I do know what a half ounce is and most of mine leaked out!!"
3,Needed two tubes instead of one...,"I ordered this product because my Nordic Track C1900 treadmill had started sticking when you walked on the belt. I have owned the treadmill for about 8 years and had never lubricated the treadmill belt. After applying one tube of lubricant, and following the directions exactly, the treadmill belt was still sticking, so now I've ordered another tube in hopes that two will do the trick!"
2,Tiny quantity Cheapie applicator,"The review title pretty much says it all. The quantity was not sufficient to fully lube my admittedly very dry belt and platform. I think it is probably .5 oz and not the .05 oz listed in the product specs, but even so there are much better values out there."
2,did'nt work for me,"did'nt stop my treadmill from squeaking,but it may be the roller that's making the noise.expensive for the amount you get."
3,Performant lube,Lube helped keep the belt from slipping. Use only one tube unlike some of the reviews that indicated two tubes are necessary.
2,One tube was not enough,"Used one of the tubes to relubricate my treadmill belt, but it still ""grabs"" when I'm starting to walk/run on the treadmill until the belt gets well warmed up after a while of walking/running. Need to try and use the other tube to add some more lubrication, and perhaps try to get more of it into the center area of the platform and see what happens"
5,Excellent advise for an author!,"Marcia Yudkin's book 6 Steps to Free Publicity is full of outstanding advise for a writer uncertain about book promotion techniques. What made it especially helpful for me was that she outlined thoughtful game plans, and backed it up with examples. Most publishers leave the publicity for a book up to the author, yet the author is too often clueless. Marcia Yudkin's book changes the calculus. Whether you prefer online and written promotions, or you do better with personal appearances, you can and will benefit from this clearly written text. I learned a lot from this book. Highly recommended, and not just for authors."
4,Make it Happen Through the Media,"It occurred to me as I read this book that the people we regularly see on television, hear on the radio, or are featured in newspapers and magazines aren't any smarter or more talented than most of us. So why are they getting publicity for their supposed unique talents and we aren't? They understand how to utilize the media properly to gain an advantage. The media doesn't play favorites contrary to popular belief--they greatly desire to provide fresh perspectives and intriguing content to their audience. If we know how to help them, they will gladly help us. This book outlines ways we can rise above the crowd and get discovered with the help of the media.To put it succinctly: if you want to learn how to utilize the media to your advantage, get this book."
5,What A Find!,"I LOVE Marcia Yudkin's *6 Steps To Free Publicity*.After meeting with a few publicity pro's to consider partnering to launch a media campaign, I took the advice of a wise friend...I looked in the mirror and knew I was the right person to approach the media on my company's behalf. But I still needed a few expert tools as a guide.First step? I re-read *6 Steps* and dug in. It's short and to the point and written in a spirit of fun and success. Add a little help and advice from others along the way and I'm actually enjoying the whole publicity process...and, thanks to Marcia for sharing her expertise, I've saved a few agency fees to boot!"
5,Amazing!,"After having my gallbladder removed last year, I've gotten an upset stomach after meals and sometimes get symptoms similar to IBS. I take one or two of these pills before eating a meal I know will be hard on my stomach, and I've had great success. Sometimes my stomach will hurt a little (still), but I do not have diarrhea like I usually would. I would recommend this to people who have similar issues. They have been a great help to me.On a side note, I had my gallbladder taken out due to a defect, not gallstones, am a young woman, and am right where I should be weight wise, according to the BMI. I wasn't sure if these details would make a difference in the products effectiveness, but figured sharing wouldn't hurt anything."
3,Ballhead can't be removed,"This would be a great tripod--particularly given the price--if the ballhead was removable and you could replace it with a nicer one. Instead, the ballhead is permanently attached to the base by a flimsy 1/4"" rod of rather cheap metal. It's fine for point-and-shoot digicams but I wouldn't trust it with a DSLR."
4,Botanist's treasure,"Arizona Flora is an essential resource for Arizona botanists who want to identify anything beyond what color guides can offer. A more up-to-date AZ Flora is in production, but will be awhile before available as one volume, although parts can be accessed on line via the ASU Herbarium website."
5,"Halfway there, don't give up!","As we reach the midpoint of this epic adventure, the crew's morale is high when they feel that they're about to be rescued. So, they throw a big party with lots of food, music, and even a beauty contest! Alas, all too soon, their hopes are dashed, and tensions begin to rise once more.Includes the episodes...11. When the Party's Over12. Whereabouts of the Future13. If Only to Meet14. To Be Too ConsciousSpecial Features include trailers and clean opening/closing."
1,No quotation marks for Kindle edition,"I'm not sure who did the editing for the Kindle edition, but there are absolutely no quotation marks. I gave up trying to read the book in chapter one, so I cannot really comment on the content. Hopefully the Kindle edition will be redone properly."
5,GOOD BUY,THIS WATCH IS VERY GOOD QUALITY FOR THE PRICE . PURCHASED AS A PRESENT FOR A FRIEND . SHE LOVES IT . ITEM WAS RECEIVED 3 DAYS AFTER ORDERED .
3,"Watch is nice, but","As usual, Bulova makes a very nice watch. Unfortunately, my wife did not care for the looks. She thought that the band was too masculine. Further, we were unable to adjust its size for her wrist without going to a jeweler."
3,A Maxie McNabb adventure,"Intrepid senior citizen, Maxie McNabb has set off once again in her Winnebago, accompanied by her mini dachshund, Stretch. This time she is intent on exploring areas of New Mexico and makes a stop at the town of Taos. A chance encounter with a strange woman who was rescued from death by asphixiation in her car, leads Maxie to offer her a bed for the night. She confides in Maxie that she was recently taken in by a con man who stole $100,000 from her and absolutely denies attempting suicide. Maxie becomes very interested in weaving after seeing an exhibition in the town's gallery but is horrified to learn that a man's body was found in a vat of the dye used to colour the wools used in weaving. What follows is is a collection of things that could only happen to Maxie...a burglary, a kidnapping, a murder/suicide...altogether too much for a woman in her 60's to cope with...chipper as she is! It's an ok read but has a lot of scenic padding to fill it out."
4,Maxie & Stretch are at it again.,"Once again Sue Henry has taken the RV Road to adventure. This time to beautiful Taos, New Mexico where she becomes involved in yet another mystery. I love this newest character she had created. Having RV'd many of the miles Maxie covers, I appreciate the detail and accuracy given to the surroundings. A quick and delightful read!"
3,"The Tooth of Time, A Maxie abd Stretch Mystery","Enjoyable, but somewhat predictable, if you have read the other books in this series. You could practically use the book as a guide to the Taos, NM area, which is a good thing. But the author gets a bit lengthy about various weaving techniques, etc. - All and all an enjoyable book, but not a nail-biter."
2,"Lots of fluff, not much substance","I loved Maxie and Stretch in the 2 prior books in which they were characters, but this book was very disappointing. I normally like details of the characters' environment, but this book contained page after page of details, such as mentioning each business establishment Maxie passed as she walked along, each diagonal or right turn she took... and almost none of the things she passed was ever mentioned again. There was a very small percentage of words that actually were related to clues or information concerning the mystery / mysteries that Maxie eventually solved. I love New Mexico, have travelled there regularly, and have been to Taos, but this book contained way too much filler and very little relevant or even interesting material. And I was fool enough to buy the hardcover version, being so eager to read more of Maxie and Stretch!"
5,Another great book,"Yet another great read by Mrs. Henry. The detail provided, as with all her books, brings you into the story and ""along for the ride"". Keep them coming Sue. Highly recommended."
3,I love the Maxie and Stretch books,I really enjoy the Maxie and Stretch books although this one did drag a bit for me towards the end.
1,One of the few books I quit reading,"This is a poor excuse for a mystery book. Characters were either black or white, no shades of gray. Most of the time I couldn't tell whether it was an infomercial for Taos or a mystery story. I finally decided to stop wasting my time with it."
3,"Good music, abysmally short","The review posted by pedrinho_eca is excellent. I write only to add that this is only 27 minutes long, which would have been very short even in the vinyl LP era."
5,THE GREATEST LIVE ALBUM OF ALL-TIME!,"Everything great about the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem is here.From the hell-raising fury of ""Courtin' in the Kitchen"" to the heart-breaking beauty of the ""October Winds"" to the high-hilarity of ""Mr. Moses Ri-Tooral-I-Ay"" to the gut-wrenching ""Johnny, I Hardly Knew Ye"" and so on----these are the best performances of these songs. The ultimate live Irish folk album---seek this one out."
3,You get what you pay for.,"So my Vanguard VTD-2 tripod dolly came today and I wasn't extremely impressed. It holds the tripod tightly so that's a good thing. But the wheels weren't too free moving, especially on uneven surfaces. I thought maybe loosening the nuts that were holding the wheels on, but no dice. Just as long as you use it on smooth surfaces you'll be just fine. It's not perfect, but good for beginners.peace, love, happiness."
3,tripod dolly,"The tripod dolly is great for smooth surfaces but the wheels drag when on rough surfaces. However, for the price it is a great buy because it does the job."
3,Not really smooth,Not ideal for filming - shaking when moving. I'd probably rent a professional Tripod Dolly. My purpose in buying this was so that I don't have to purchase a professional dolly - only to use as a mechanism for easy transporting from spot to spot without having to pack up and collapse everything.
1,Not for me,"I am a childbirth educator and doula and I had heard that Elcano's music was great for childbirth classes and labor, so I bought this cd to hear what his style was (it was the cheapest of his cds I found on amazon and I didn't want to invest much before I knew if I would like it). I am a big fan of New Age music (particularly Lisa Lynn, Peter Kater, Liquid Mind, Hilary Stagg, Peter Sterling, and many others). ""Midnight Dream"" was not on par, in my opinion. It sounded very ""cheesy"" and my husband and I couldn't even stand to listen to this cd. The style is very annoying to us. However, I bought this on the high reviews others gave it, so it must be wonderful to some ears--but not mine or my husband's."
1,Worst CD of 2007!,"Save yourself -DO NOT BUY THIS CD IF YOU LIKE GOOD MUSIC!! I only bought this CD because I read some guy's review that compared him to SRV in regard to his playing and singing style. The guy that wrote that is an idiot. This CD is so bad that i cringe when I see the cover. Nuno's tired riffs and half-hearted playing make me want to vomit. His lyrics are terrible. His singing is decent at best; unfortunately he is singing his own material.The one positive thing that I have to say about this CD is that the picture on the cover reminds me of David Caruso from CSI: Miami. That, and it's not my music. Terrible!"
2,Can't use it for a text book.,"I usually like the Quickstart guides and I waited a long time for this book. I'm teaching an introductory computer programming course this semester using REALbasic and I delayed making a textbook choice because this book was supposed to ready in time. The ""Definitive Guide"" is available, but maybe a little too heavy, so I kept hoping this would be ready and resemble most of the Quickstart guides - short examples that illustrate one point. I wondered why it was twice as long as most Quickstart Guides. Now I know why - it starts with one GIGANTIC example of creating an HTML editor. Not something I'm interested in creating and not something that I can ask my high school students to sit down and do in one session. There are good parts in the book, but they start after that awful HTML editor section. We chose the ""Definitive Guide"" which is broken into manageable chapters."
2,REALbasic for Macintosh,"Book is currently out-of-date. After updating, it may become a good reference."
3,less than I anticipated,"I do admire the works of Franzetta. That being said, I was expecting more paintings especially along the lines of Conan and such. Maybe I misread the description before I ordered. I was somewhat disappointed."
4,frazetta- the fantasy lives on,"I thought all was lost when I lost my entire 4 vol collection of frazetta's work about 10 yrs ago, but nay!! here we have some of his great work published again to serve as inspiration or pleasure for budding artists and fans of fantasy arts and stories. every one may have more critical opinions , but I'm just glad to have these images to gaze upon from time to time and dream about ' what if I could do that..."" whether as a character or the artist."
5,Living Legend,FRAZETTA IS GOD!!!!! The man is the modern day equivalent of Da Vinci. You WILL NOT be disappointed by this book. My only wish is that I was wealthy enough to purchase his original artwork!!!
5,Excellent book about Frazetta,"I've admired Frank Frazetta's work since I first saw some cover art he did for Ballantine Books in the late `60's or early `70's. As if his gifts of crisp draftsmanship, imaginative composition and striking color aren't enough, he knows how to ""sell"" a concept. In that sense, he's kin to Fredric Remington and N.C. Wyeth, Nowadays, many of his images are iconic and anyone who ventures into the world of fantasy illustration is forced to measure his or her work against Frazetta's. The copious and often breathtaking examples artwork notwithstanding, what I liked equally was the background story - especially the role that Ellie, his wife, played as his muse, manager and rudder."
3,As good as Icon...,"SPECIFICS:Page Count: 195Number of images: 209Small images: 118Half page images: 7Full page images: 752-page spreads: 9BW images: 79TEXT:Lots of text about the author, is life and his workART:6 images: 5 stars27 images: 4 stars94 images: 3 stars56 images: 2 stars27 images: 1 starOverall: 3 stars"
4,Great first book,"The reason i didn't give it 5 stars is that i compared it to one of my favorite books in the last decade called ""If I Never Get Back""by Darryl Brock and the Sam Fowler character from that book to Reb Joe Tyler In Jeff Hutton's""Perfect Silence"".Whoever liked one of the books I mentioned will also love the other.In the ""Perfect Silence"" Jeff Hutton describes life on the farm at the time of the War between the states and the beginings of our national pastime in detail.It's a great book but I wish he would of given us alittle more detail of Joe's life with the ""Terryville Niners""and more stories of some of Joe's escapades with that team.It's a great book anyway.And I am just pointing out something that to me would of made it even more enjoyable."
3,Cheap,"I bought this faucet for my kids bathroom makeover. I was on a tight budget! This faucet is a little sloppy in its and hard to adjust the temperature to a good setting. It has allot of play in the handle. Its OK for the money wish I could have used it first, but then again you get what you pay for!"
4,Slammin' Sammy,"It's been a while since the 1940'a and styles have changed, but this is still an entertaining look at the life and times of one of golf's legnedary players. Somehow I doubt he was ever quite as ""country"" as Sam and his publicist's and biographer's would have us believe, but he certainly was a great and durable player and a generous and compassionate human being. And when he talks about how he came to understand his golf swing, it's way better than merely good!"
3,ROMEO,"AS AN ""OLD HACKER"", I ENJOYED THIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY ABOUT SAM SNEAD....ONE OF AMERICA'S ALL-TIME GREAT GOLFERS. HIS PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIFE WAS REVEALED IN DETAIL WITH HIS ,STILL RELEVANT, TIPS AND STRATEGIES.THE EDITING WAS A LITTLE ROUGH, BUT A GOOD READ FORGOLFERS ENJOYING THEIR GOLDEN YEARS."
4,Enjoyable Reading,Great stories with golf instruction in a great mix to keep one interested. I was much more interested in his life stories as I am way beyond help on the golf course. One has to know his complete life story to fully appreciate his athletic abilities.
5,Fascinating view of a PGA pro life before golf was huge money,The stories and golf advice contained in this book are amazing. If you are an active golfer at any handicap you will certainly find nuggets of golden advice throughout.
3,Less than perfect tripod,"This compact tripod is good if you are wanting to do close ups of small items, but when you extend the legs there is no stability."
5,Absolutely Perfect!,Exactly what I needed and exactly what I wanted and at a price considerably lower than I expected. Prints beautiful copies and sends fine faxes around the world from Michigan to Munich to Moscow.I could not possibly be more pleased.
1,HORRIBLE!! Shopping for its replacement!,I have this fax machine now - and I am looking for a replacement to it...and here I stumple across it. I highly recommend you DO NOT buy it! We have a horrible time faxing or copying more than one page..the rollers like to eat up and jam the paper.
4,2 Questions ...,"Great Fax Machine.. easy to setup and understand. First thing is I just dont understand why there is no tray, to catch the paper. Second thing is... I need to know more on the PC Interface plug located in the back of the machine.Thank you very much."
3,alot of hassle but it will work,"well after recieving a plane with a twisted sole, a new one was sent and checked. ok now but that was the first of many pains. the adjustment is just plain sloppy, probably about 3 to 4 turns before it actually does anything. i had a very hard time tuning it to take a thin shaving about .005 on poplar was ok but harder to push through hardwood. i would like about .003 shavings on my jointer but just couldnt get it. the machining is sloppy and course. and after spending a LONG time flattening the blade and sharpening it was dull very fast, on poplar wood. so im guessing the blade is a softer metal.. so as i heard many a times you get what you pay for and that is what i thought i could afford. wish i would have just put a lie nielsen on the credit card and i wouldnt be resharpening a blade after one nights use or flattening a sole"
4,Great light scent,"In addition to the great light scent, doesn't take forever to wash off hands not too soapy.Aesthetically pleasing, I like the pump doesn't discharge too much soap."
5,Great mild scent hand soap with no triclosan,I don't like most liquid hand soaps with strong floral scents. Or anti-bacterial soaps with triclosan which makes its way into lakes and streams.But I like the mild scent in Method Sweetwater hand wash. It works well and comes in a nice looking clear bottle which looks good in almost any bathroom or kitchen.
5,"Looks great, smells good!","I got hooked on to Method Hand Wash a long time ago, when Costco sold multi-packs. The bottle looks good in our guest bathrooms, and the soap smells nice. Costco long ago stopped carrying it, and local stores sometimes do, sometimes don't. When they do, it is expensive. Ordering on Amazon is convenient, and amongst the lowest priced options for this hand soap."
5,Great Product,This is my favorite hand washing product and the containers are so simplistic that they fit in everywhere. Method is a great product and I wish they would come back out with their shower gel. Can't find it anywhere else and Amazon doesn't have it either.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"While I do like this soap I was disappointed that at least to me it smells absolutely nothing like grapefruit, which was the whole reason why I ordered this product in the first place."
5,"Method Hand Soap, Green Tea and Aloe",I had used this soap at a friend's house where he had it in an automatic dispenser. It works well with the dispenser and doesn't dry out my skin. Very pleasant smell too.
5,Very lightly scented soap,"I bought this because I wanted a more ""natural"" product to wash hand with and because it has a very nice light scent. I hate strong scents, especially on my body and this is barely noticeable. I would definitely buy it again."
3,Method Hand Soap,"This soap is well---------soap. Nothing special. Foams well, cleans your hands and does not leave a lingering girly smell so my husband uses it without complaint."
4,Love it. Too expensive.,"Method Soap, specifically the Sweet Water scent is perfect. You don't need much to be effective, it lasts a long time, it smells great and it's a soft smell that doesn't linger, it feels good on my hands... but it's too damn expensive. At my local grocery store, it's (on sale) currently $3.50. I ended up buying some softly scented vanilla Dial soap for $1 on sale instead. It's usually better priced on Amazon, and if you get the refill pack at 34oz (pack of 6) it works out to about $2.16/bottle which is way more manageable. But still, from the price, you'd think they collect this soap as dew from a rare flower. Considering how good the soap is, I'd almost believe it."
2,Scent Not Great,I love these Method hand soaps but this does not smell anything like Pink Grapefruit at all....prefer the Green Tea.
2,Quite bland,These are quite bland; I was looking for the ones that have soy sauce for a little jolt.
3,Struggling to stay alive...,"Two very different teens are forced to rely upon one another for their very survival when their car crashes in a remote area during a blizzard.Fifteen-year-old Tony Laporte, the only son of a large, loving Italian family, has been thoroughly spoiled by the hardworking parents who want him to have everything they never could. Meanwhile, Cindy Reichert, a loner who is being raised by her widowed father, is accustomed to a more introspective life. Yet one afternoon when she decides to hitchhike and is picked up by Tony, both their lives change forever.Mazer's novel, seemingly simple, also depicts the intricacies of human relationships -- as well as how easy it is to take the good things in life for granted."
5,Intresting Survival,I studied this book because I had to write an english project on this book in grade 9. This story is about a boy named Tony who gets bored with his life.One day he finds a dog which he likes to keep with him but his paretns disagree.After an argument they agree.One night the dog makes noises because of which the Tonys father kicks the dog out of the house.Tony gets angry and wants to teach his parents a lesson so he takes his mom's car and goes to his Uncle.On his way a he picksup a hitchhacker named cindy.Cindy is a girl who does not want to mix with other people.Tony tries to impres her by showing his tricks and lands on a rock.The car is broken.The story is about thier survival.WILL THEY SURVIVE??????????
3,SNow bound,"I had to read this book for a school project and all fot he other students thought that it was boring. Personally I thinkt hat they are just saying that beucase it would be ""uncool"" to think that it was cool.I think that it is was a good book becauseit was based on the truth."
2,How long will these stories be forced down our throat?,"I personally am quite tired of reading the same basic survival story, spewed out again and again by obviously struggling writers. Spoiled boy. Boy meets girl. Disaster occurs (ie being snowbound.) Girl reforms boy. Both realize how much they need each other. Happy ending, everything is saved. Grrrr.... Is this really literature??"
2,book,"I personally did not care for this book. But it was a realy nice book to write for other poeple, and if you really like adventures you would like to read this book."
2,this story is an alright book,I think the book SnowBound was pretty good. The author Harry Mazer did a pretty good job with it. This book is good for anybody that likes stories of survival and adventure. I would recommend this book to anybody of the ages ten and up. Give it a try and see how you like it.
3,Forced to mature and survive,"This story i found intreasting but not compared to mazer's other ones. The story begins with Tony Laporte, a spoiled brat child who goes off into a mad rage. When his parents refuse to keep a stray he found, he steals his mothers car driving off to his uncle's when he picks up a hitchiker, cindy, cindy is appalled at tony's selfish and spoiled behavior when tony takes a wrong turn into the deep dark lonesome forest how will he survive how will these two strangers get along what happens when two strangers who dont like eachother are put in bad circumstances forced together? will they survive?"
1,"childish, bigoted, and just plain stupid","Well, if you're an anti-Catholic bigot, just LOVE empty-headed after-school specials, and know absolutely nothing about the truth of the Galileo case, I'm sure you'll love this badly-acted bit of foolishness. I had my students watch it. The bad acting pained them. One asked: ""What did we do to you that made you so angry that you forced us to watch that idiotic thing?"" The problem was, I had assigned them to read the actual historical documents on the Galileo case BEFORE they watched the movie. So they saw all the historical absurdities at once. Bottom line: childish pratfalls, intellectually dishonest anti-religious bigotry, along with remarkably stupid historical inaccuracies. As an example of propaganda and bigotry, it's great. As history, well, put it this way: the Scottish accents in the movie ""The 300"" is closer to the truth of the Spartans than this boring drivel is to Galileo."
3,"Interesting, but a little goes a long way","This is another group with an interesting sound...but unfortunately it sounds the same song after song. Their other albums may have more variety, but this one didn't."
5,I love this band!,"I first saw this group at the Celtic Festival in Sebastopol, CA in 2007 and bought all their CDs. This is the original line-up and they're great. If you are not familiar with traditional music from Quebec, but you like Celtic music, you should give them a listen. The dance tunes are frequently Irish or Scottish in origin, although there are original tunes as well. The songs are in French; some are new, most are new arrangements of old French songs. These guys are great musicians and the arrangements are very catchy, and you don't have to know French to enjoy the songs. The other albums are also very enjoyable. First they changed guitarists and then accordionists, but I recommend all their CDs. See them live if you get the chance. Lively, jazz-infused folk, tastefully arranged."
5,Bob is Boffo!,"We first heard Bob Allison at the Emerson Inn at Rockport, Masschusetts, and fell in love with his music and his charm. His CD, ""Sounds of Scandia"", takes us back to those wonderful evenings of romantic love songs and always serves as the background music for parties. It provides instant, great ambience. Fans of Cole, Gershwin, and the old standards will be thrilled with this wonderful CD. Bob is our own Bobby Short, and we look forward to hearing him each year in person."
4,Nice Snapshot of the best New Wave had to offer circa 1986...,"I heard a tune from this release once on a radio station local to me back in the summer of 1986 and never forgot it. Clean production and very Fixxesque elements compelled me to go for the full record. I found the cd, ""Almacantar"" years later discounted at a record store and was pleasantly surprised. Much of the recording shines but the single ""Kiss You (When It's Dangerous)"" is clearly the standout track to these ears and possibly the best Fixx 'inspired' song you never heard. It may not have been an American Top 40 hit but it did crack the Hot 100 here in the U.S. and made it onto a number of radio playlists. No complete new wave collection should be left without giving this a try."
4,Attention All Fixx Fans,"Another one for the ""Shame It's Out-of-Print"" File. This Ottawa quintet put out this album in '87 (reissued from an Apprentice label release in '86) and then one more album, ""Big Houses,"" in '90, then they were gone. I can't speak for the second release as I've never seen or heard it, but ""Almacantar"" was a pure-bred Fixx knock-off. It was even produced by Rupert Hine, who worked on a number of Fixx albums. As long as you don't mind its copycat sound (or if you're a Fixx nut like me and you collect any band that sounded similar), this is great stuff. ""Where's Bula?"" won a Canadian radio contest in '86, which is how Eight Seconds originally got noticed, and ""Kiss You (When It's Dangerous)"" is alleged to have been a Top-30 U.S. hit (though I don't recall ever hearing it on the radio). If you can find it, grab it, especially if it's cheap. The sharks on eBay will make you pay upwards of 30 clams for it."
5,Timex Kid's Watch # T75201 - Rotating Disc,I bought the watch with ball for a 7-year-old boy. He told me he had been wearing it every day. I think he likes it.
2,Disappointing,"We bought these for our boys (ages 5 and 7). While I agree that the adjustable band is great and durable, the timepiece ran slow after only a couple of months. Not only that, the indiglo feature stopped working too. If your kids are learning to tell time, and don't care if they have the correct time, this is an okay watch."
1,Does not last long,"I purchase this watch for my son and a similar one for my daughter, and both of them stopped working when we were at the beach. Both watches had humidity trapped. I understood that they were waterproof! Also the wrist bracelet on this watch would not stay tight."
1,Can't read time.,"These looked so good for a boy in the picture but actually it's extremely hard to read time when the second hand is actually those balls that keeps on jumping before your eyes. I got it for my son when he was learning to tell time he was excited with the way they looked but then it made him hate telling time because he never got it right because of the design. Also the strap isn't strong enough, it's elastic and when it snaps once it's impossible to get it to fit tightly again. BAD idea for kids under 10 years."
4,good value,This cute and colorful watch appeals to kids. The stretchy wristband makes it easy to take off and put on. A good watch for the price.
2,Not great...,"I bought this lamp because my halogen lamp put out so much heat, it was nearly unusable. I wanted something that I could put a CF bulb into to save on heat production (and energy usage). The price was a big selling point, and it looked good enough in the pictures.This lamp isn't very well made. The connection between the base and the arm is very loose (wobbles side-to-side, back and forth, and rotates with barely any force at all. Also, the switch (built into the back of the head) is very flimsy and doesn't fit on the head straight.I'm keeping it, but only because I need a lamp that I can use and don't want to spend over $100 on one--but I'm not happy."
2,"Loved it, but the switch broke","After 11 months of casual use with a fluorescent bulb, the switch completely gave out. I love the lamp, but hard to use it when you can't turn it off or on."
2,Ledu L413MB Incandescent Swing Arm Desk Lamp,Off and on switch ridiculously designed. It is non functioning. What a shame because the rest of the lamp is good.
4,great,"Alley Kat is the name the main characther Bryann's is given when he starts helping fight crime after his beautiful wife Rita is murdered at their home, so he is left to take care of their daughter. If you are into love stories or suspense, you don't want to miss this one, You're gonna be in for a lot of surprises."
5,Nice work!,"There's a lot of pap on the animal/pet book market, but this one rises above the rest. Written clearly and with personality and experience, Sara Stein also includes diagrams on how to construct shelters for the animals in this book. Great job!"
5,A really neat book,"I had this book when I was a teenager. I used to love to read through the explanations about animals I knew I'd never have, like spiders or goats. But it was interesting for me anyway. Most lovely, the author's love and respect for all animals shines through. And it's very clever to describe a toad as an ""overnight guest."" I got a copy for my cousin's kids, who live in the country on the edge of some woods and fields."
4,Thank you BBC and Paul!,Love this single-disc BBC collection of Paul Weller's best TV performances over the solo years since the '90s. Very pleased we can play it OK in the USA too!!
4,"If you want an Inexpensive but good labeler, this is the one","This is probably the least expensive labeler around that gives you a both an LCD display and a close to QWERTY keyboard. I've seen units at equal price that didn't give you an LCD screen (to see what you type) or give you a QWERTY type keyboard.If you plan to do infrequent labeling, but want a good/compact device to do it, this is the unit to buy. At $29.99, you really can't go wrong.One thing to be aware of is that the Label cartridges are not very big and you will replace cartridges faster than the more expensive labeler units (The cartridges are from $6-$9 each). One thing I don't like about this unit is that some common character like ""#"" and ""$"" are not easily accessable as you have to go thru several keystrokes to get the character to show up.If you do alot of Labeling, want bigger cartridges or want a true Qwerty Keyboard, then the PT-1700 (at $10-$15 more than the PT-85) may be a better alternative"
5,Brother Ptouch PT85,We purchased this product to replace an identical machine which failed after 12 years of relatively hard use. So far it is performing well. We got this one rather than a newer model because we are familiar with the controls and settings and had a stock of tapes on hand to fit it. I hope this one lasts another 12 years.
5,One of the greatest collaborative translations ever,An exciting selection of poems by known and previously unknown women poets. Ling Chung's scholarship and sensitivity gave the late great Kenneth Rexroth the insight and inspiration to outdo himself here. Buy two copies and give one to a friend.
2,Bad translation,"The editors made a good try to translate the poems, but the result makes me laugh!They can translate the meanings but they can't keep the feelings, formats, sounds, favors, and metaphors.This book can fool people who can't read Chinese. Chinese is my first language, this book can't fool me!If you are a professor or teacher, please stop showing off your ""good taste"" by forcing your student to read this piece of stupid translation. You need to learn Chinese to read real Chinese poem."
3,"Useful, but cheese-laden","While this book is a ""standard"" figure pose book (1 figure shot from 12 angles or so,) the subject matter is rather cheesey. Lots of half-dressed, bent-over, up-the-skirt shots."
5,This video RULES!,"this video is the coolest of them all! especially the beginning. and Jakob sings in it...awwww.Yea, go buy it!"
5,laura learn she was waiting for twins,she wanted to tell manuel but he had left with his wife for a second honey moon........
4,A Good Multi Purpose Bag,"The bag is well made and very practical for day trips. The downside for me is that the bag is much larger than I wanted and the National Geo logo on the front of the bag distracts from the bag's appearance. The logo makes the bag look like it was complimentary gift for attending a National Geo event or conference.The bag is large enough for 1-2 SLRs, extra lens, gadgets and a small laptop. I wanted a bag just for my photo adventures (SLR & extra lens). I have ordered the small bag and will use the medium bag as my carry-on bag for air travel.It would have been helful if the bag had been pictured with a person or with a camera.I am very interested to see how the light weight kemp fabric wears compared to the heavy canvas Donke bags which I used previously.Overall a good buy especially if you are looking for a photo equipment plus bag!"
5,Perfect size,"Took the bag for a quick trip to Mexico. It fit my D60 with two lenses and my Thinkpad X61 easily, and still had enough room for some Christmas presents :)The outer pockets are ideal to hold passport and tickets, or anything you need quick access to. The overall quality of the used materials is really good and I have to admit that the bag looks really, really cool.Will be my carry on luggage from now on, if I travel with camera or without.Very happy with the bag."
5,It's rally cheap.,"I wanted to buy it before. It has many pokets and good design.When I visited in the USA, it was really cheap.That's why I bought it. Next time, I'll buy different model."
5,Great value,Fits everything I need it to with sufficient padding and protection. Love the look as well.
3,NG 2475,"Bought this one after buying the medium backpack and taking that one on vacation. The backpack was good for travelling with a 15 inch laptop and DSLR, but not for much else. I wanted something more versatile for daily use. Something that could carry things other than my MacBook Pro and/or my DSLR if I wanted to. You can do that with this bag, but a 15 inch laptop is definitely out of the question. It won't fit."
4,NG 2475 Shoulder bag,"This bag it's made of first class materials and you can carry a lot of stuff in it. The only thing I have noticed so far it's that it feels kind of heavy when it's fully loaded, however after playing a bit with the straps I could fix that."
5,Mom C.,Fantastic hat - son has had many compliments - hard to find big enough size for fit - great quality and great fit.
3,Not sturdy enough for my 70x15 binocular,"The adapter is made of plastic and it is not quite strong enough to hold my 70mmx15 binocular steady. Every little movement will cause the binocular to oscillate and it'll take a few seconds to stop. On the bright side, it is pretty slim so it fits on my binocular quite easily. Bottom line, it may be good enough for small binocular, but you'll need a metal one if you are going to use it with a heavy binocular."
2,BA-168 Tripod Adapter,"I was not pleased with the plastic adapter that came with the binoculars. It shook too much.I got this adapter and thought ""Hot Dilly Dog!"" The end result was that the binoculars didnot shake as much. I think if the BA-168 were shorter this would increase the stability ofthe Binoculars even more. If anyone knows of a shorter adapter I would like to hear about it."
1,Outdated and confusing,"This book is written for an ancient version of minitab, version 10. Heavy emphasis on command line codes. Statistical explantions are highly technical. Do not waste your money. The free tutorial that comes with Minitab has significantly more value."
4,Caring for an elderly parent who needs to eat,"This Carnation Instant breakfast has been a life-saver for my mother who is not able to eat much. She is battling cancer and has been losing weight. But with one can, she gets nearly half a day's amount of calories (560 calories). And she likes the taste. This was recommended by an attending nurse and nutritionist. I can only find this online. It's a very heavy box. Best to send it right to the person consuming it."
3,It's Ok..,"I ordered this for a friend who is losing weight due to cancer treatments. She said ""it's ok"" butwished they had a chocolate flavor."
4,Good for days in the dark,"For camping out of your car, RV-ing, or, like me, enduring storm blackouts, this is a great choice for general illumination. The light can be set bright enough to easily read by or to illuminate an entire room (or tent or campsite). Plus, it takes batteries you can stock up on or find at grocery/convenience/drug stores. Admittedly it's not that attractive, it doesn't look like an expensive product, and it's too heavy and bulky for backpacking. But you aren't paying for any of that, you're paying for the LEDs and they deliver."
5,This is an extraordinary product,"Long lasting, strong light, solid quality construction. You should definately buy this if you are looking for a lantern. The cheaper ones do not measure up."
5,LED Lantern,"I am very happy with this lantern, it seems to be well made. It works well and the light is bright enough. I believe it will work fine if my electric goes out again. I am using it now when I get up in the night and want a glass of water or a snack. I have it on the counter so Instead of flicking lights on and off, burning electric, I use the lantern. Works for me!"
5,THIS IS THE ONE TO BUY!,"This is one great lantern---I love how long it will provide light on one set of batteries, and the fact that even on its lowest setting, it provides enough light to see in a large room. At the highest setting it is brighter than almost any lantern I've ever used (and those were the kind you had to light with a match). I had my first one for power outages and rarely had to use it, but recently moved to an area much more prone to outages (we just had our first here a few days ago). That recent outage made me appreciate again what a good lantern this is...I just ordered two more because my new place has many more rooms, and with this lamp's extended light, I have no concern about turning it to low and leaving it on and just letting it run until bedtime. It also runs without heat so is safe to use anywhere anytime. An excellent product."
5,8-Years Later: Hurricane Season and It's Still Going Strong,"By far I would recommend this storm lantern over any of the others I have tried.I live in a city directly next to the Gulf of Mexico where we get hurricane threats all during that season.I need a lantern that is long-lasting like this one, and that can handle extended power outages that might last for days.What I did not expect was for this lantern to still be working -- 8 years after I purchased it on Amazon in 2004!The adjustable ultra-bright 12-LED light is amazing. You can set it to get only the minimum light in a room, or turn it up for more brightness. This light does not produce heat. This is very important in the hot and humid climate where I live, especially if you are going for days without electricity or A/C.I highly recommend this lantern to anyone looking for a reliable storm lantern that will last them for years to come!"
3,Does the author feel guilty about something?,I purchased this book for a church study group. We have all managed to glean a little helpful advice but mostly the author seems to feel guilt for his lifestyle and choices and tries to say all suburbanites suffer from the same failings. Not so!
1,Capitalizing on Evangelical B.S.,"This is a lame attempt at a capitalist trying to judge other evangelical capitalists. It is offensive as it is legalistic in its own self-righteous, pejorative stance. If the author wants to make a difference, move out of Wheaton, and designate 90% of the proceeds of his cause to go ministry that is actually cutting edge, instead of being a self-righteous, finger-pointing, bigoted member of the establishment AND cashing in on it."
5,Examine yourself,"This is a great book the will cause most people who read it (even if they don't live in the burbs)to look deep within to find some motivations that they might not be happy seeing. If you wish to live the self examined life, this is a great book for you."
3,Half Way There,"I bought this book because of the title. Living in the suburb and being a leader in a surburban church, the subject matter concerns me deeply. I believe that Goetz is right on the mark in unearthing some of how contemporary American thinking is hazardous to the message of the Gospel, or at least has the potential to dilute the Gospel. Thus the book puts into words some concerns many of us feel but are unable to express.The answers provided by the book are a little simplistic, but the answers are in the honest reading of another book that has sold a few copies--the Bible."
5,To the point!,Helpful insights. Goetz gives names to the obstacles and opportunities which are ever present in Christian discipleship. Well done. An enjoyable read.
4,An introspective book for remembering spirituality in our fast-paced lives,"This book caught my eye when my husband and I moved out of the main part of Columbus to the suburbs in order to get our oldest son enrolled in a good kindegarten. I was worried about becomming a soul-less yuppie anyway, and so this book really jumped out at me. I must say - I was not dissappointed. It seems to be geared toward generation x a bit (my generation) I could see older people feeling uncomfortable with some of Goetz' illustrations and his laid back writing style.I loved the quotes he included from Fenelon and others. I don't often read things from those old mystic thinkers - but some of what they had to say about suffering and quiet were so thought-provoking. I don't agree with everything in this book - but I love how it made me think. I have used quotes from it it lectures and papers.I would definately recommend it!"
5,A recommended pick,"Why and how did ancient cultures disappear where women were at the heart of their worlds, and how has this disappearance influenced over three thousand years of Western civilization's development? In Search of the Lost Feminine: Decoding the Myths that Radically Reshaped Civilization is a recommended pick for any strong women's studies or women's history holding: it virtually re-writes history and uses archaeological and social facts to follow ancient history to modern times.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
1,Not a Bemis product,"NOT a Bemis product, as advertised. This is a generic product, not as pictured. Good price, just false advertising. Have not tried it yet."
3,GNOO ZOO,"slow start, was hard to keep children interested,Was really disappointed because I have read alot of Sheila Walsh's books expected much more"
4,WILD & WONDERFUL,"I suggest you read his bookAffirmationsfirst, before this one and the others in the Taos Quartet. He continues his discussion of the universal life force here, in the chapters entitled: Reincarnation, guides & the higher self; Understanding the force; Developing a flow of communication; Four disciplines of the initiates; Love of the force sets you free; and Your life's ultimate goal. Wilde has a very unique style of writing and all his books are interesting - I just don't think the suggested exercises always work or are always applicable. I am not sure I agree with his dietary recommendations either. Nevertheless, this is a good read, especially for his take on the different ""selves"" and the discussion of vibrational patterns. I think that the mere act of reading his books raises one's vibrations!"
5,A Very Powerful Little Book,"I stumbled upon this short book by accident, although I'm an avid reader of books on consciousness and inner development. It concisely and unerringly deals with what many of us know intuitively about the way that things are. Some of the material may be unpalatable for some readers, but Stuart Wilde directs us to truth and the rules that govern our progress, without avoiding any issues. He has a powerful, direct style and one senses that the message is too important to waste time on borderline issues."
4,NDE Sincerity,The book was a quick and enjoyable read. Grace seems very sincere and believable. I like her writing style. She is very discriptive and to the point. She seems most interested in sharing the precise details of her experience as well as the lessons learned from it. I would highly recommend this book. In an age where people will do or say anything to make a buck I find grace's story fresh and reashuring.
5,Unbelievable,"For minimalist music, this album has unbelievable melodies and production. Excellent and diverse instruments light up the tracks in the album. A must buy for anyone."
5,Just awesome,"Wow! This is the best album of 2004 yet. Never heard of the moonbabies until i was recommended to buy this album from parasol.com It's simply breathtaking, love the harmonies and the vibe that's on this bloody fantastic album. Genius!"
3,a bunch of great musicians but...,"I know these guys, and so do most latin jazz fans. These cats are great, but something is missing. There are few arresting solos here. Most of them are stunted. The players are not given the time to complete their statements. I find this very frustrating. In my opinion the arrangements of most of the tunes are not up to par. For example: The tune, Sun Goddess, is a great one and with the latin treatment could have been as good as the original, but... the soloists have just enough time to make only half statements! Go ahead and give the eight minutes the original song has. Letting the musician speak his heart completely can only help the song. I understand that sometimes we are given only ""X"" amount of bars, but sometimes you are better off breaking the rules. All these musicians are outstanding but some of the tunes never deliver the passion I'm waiting for. This is an ok latin jazz cd that left me slightly unsatisfied. Ray--latinjazz drummer."
4,For What its worth.,"I bought this for my husband for valentines. I am fond of video games. But do not play as much as he does. I am not very good at them and often get frustrated with long in deapth games. The Wii is great in this aspect. We can play Wii Sports and Wii Play together. I enjoy the time we spend doing this. Also it is great when we have people of all ages over. Its a good party game, And the games are short enough that people can take turns all around. This is not nearly as good as Sports, but it is what it is. Lots of fun, for those of us who like to play and be social, or who are not big gamers. Also very good for younger children."
2,"My 8 year old liked it, for about a day","I picked this up because I figured - heck a controller and you get a game for about 10 bucks more. Well, maybe I should have thought twice and just purchased the controll and nunchuck combo because the game held my 8 year olds attention for about 1 day total. He did play it through all of the levels to the tanks, which he did really like. But with games like Lego Star Wars for only $20 I would have been much better off to get the combo and another game and skip the wii play."
3,Good Value if you need extra Wiimote!,"We got this game so we could have a second controller. I am not very impressed with the game itself, it's not bad but I wouldn't recommend it if it didn't come with an extra controller."
2,Only if you need another remote,"After playing sports resort where the games are a lot more fun and graphics more presentable, wii play just isn't up to par. I bought this because I needed another remote and since a remote costs $36 (nintendo) or $30 (nyko), I guess to pay a little more for a remote + game may be a better deal. Like many other reviewers have said, it's like a buying a remote for $30 and $10 for the game.However, not all the games are bad. I like the pool game. The shooting game is simple but passable. The cow game is also fun but pretty much for young kids. The tank game is ok. The rest is just plain silly.So if you need another remote, go ahead and get this. Otherwise pass on the games. Better off getting sports resort."
3,Okay but not great,"I bought this product thinking it would have a lot of great games AND I would get the second remote I needed. Well it isn't bad, but also isn't great. The remote is the remote - nothing more, nothing less. Some of the games are a lot of fun, but others are just a waste. My favorite is Billiards. It centers solely around the 9 ball game, but is a lot of fun for the entire family. Maybe an 8 ball game is out there, but not in this package. Shooting and ping pong are also fun. Pose Mii is just stupid, but I guess kids might enjoy it. I do like the multi-player function. I guess for the price it is worth the $10...especially if you aren't a die hard game person and would enjoy some good old fun."
5,Wii Play with Wii Remote,"Awesome game, a lot of different games to play and keep kids or guest having fun for hours"
4,Fun Basic Games and Includes Wii-mote!,"If you recently got a new Wii System, or are in need of an additional Wii-mote, then this is a great buy. It comes with a Wii-mote and includes the Wii Play collection of games. The games are very basic, and remind me of early Nintendo games or Atari games.My favorite is definitely the Tank game. You can play one player or two players to team up against the enemy tanks. Although a very simple game, it has provided countless hours of entertainment for me and friends.The best thing about the Wii Play games is that they are simple, and most people can get the hang of them, even if they have never played with a Wii before.I recommend this set because of the added controller that comes with it."
2,Better idea to just buy the remote separately,"Like most of these other reviews I'll emphasize that this is basically a gimmick to get you to buy some pretty lame games because they are packaged with the remote.Chances are like most people, myself included, you'll play the games once or twice, figure out they are pretty lame and wish you had just bought the remote by itself instead."
3,good way to get a remote and add a game to your collection,Very simple game and fun to play for awhile. The kids and I enjoyed it but it got old after awhile. We have played it here and there. This was a great way to get a new remote and it is easier to pay for the remote when you get a game with it.
3,Not much fun,If you need an extra remote you might as well pay an extra 10 for this package. Billiards is the only game on this disk that I have had the desire to play more than once. You will probably only get about an hour of playtime out of this unless you are under 13 or are playing with another person.
4,worth the money,"most of the games are great there are a couple that are not worth it but for the money it is well worth it, besides you need an extra wii mote"
1,Don't waste your money,"As most people pointed out, it seems like a good deal at first. Why pay just for the controller, when you can pay a little bit extra and get the game. (Un)Luckily, I got this game from a friend for free (who probably bought it for the controller). Most of the games just don't work right. If you want a fun game to play when friends come over Mario Kart or Wii Sports are much better options."
1,Save $10...just buy the remote,The game is really lame. Save yourself $10 and just buy a remote separately. Use your ten bucks and buy a book.
2,Not Very Fun,It wasn't that much more for the game and the controller so we bought the game+controller pack. Wii Play is really hard to play and control and doesn't have very fun games.
2,only worth it for the extra controller,the only reason i purchased this was because of the wii-mote that comes with it. this game ran off with the excitement over wii sports and totally killed it
4,Great for the remote but a horrible game over all,"I decided to get the wii play because I thought it would be a great buy for the remote. Unfortunantly, I wasted the 10 dollars I could of saved by just buying the remote. There are a few fun games like shooting range and the fishing pond. And the cow racing game is just hillarious to watch your mii person riding on the back of a cow! Still all of these games have just one way of playing it and it gets boring after you have played it twice. I have never played this game by myself and I never intend to. So if you want some really bad mini games and the remote go ahead and buy it."
4,play with mii,The reason i bought this game was for the free remote. It was a much better deal then buying the remote seperatly. I enjoyed the games that come with it. The only part i didnt like is how you have to origionally progress through all the games before you can individually select which game you would choose to play. Have fun and play
4,Love the amount of games on it.,There is alot of games on one disc and that is what I like about this game.
2,good buy if you want the wiimote,games are a bit of a bore but is a good combination if you want an extra remote.
3,Wii Play Together,"The big value here is the controller that comes packaged with the game. Normally selling for 39.99 by itself, you basically get the game for 10 bucks! Luckily it's worth about that much, not that its bad, but the replay value is short. Some of the games will lose you after the first go around, but you will return to others mostly with a friend to play with. Wii Play is definitely worth its price and a nice addition to the Wii library of games."
3,Buy it for the controller...,"If you need an extra controller, then this ""package"" is a good deal. Otherwise, I think the game is only enjoyable for kids. It basically uses the various games to teach you the various ways to manipulate the remote."
3,Buy it for the Wii Remote,"Wii Play is not really a game bundled with a controller.It's more of a controller bundled with a game.There are 9 games in Wii Play, some more enjoyable then others.I personally think that Shooting and Tanks are by far the best mini games in this collection.Overall, a casual gamer should enjoy it and it is fun for a bit...but it is a very shallow game.I say you should get it, it's worth it for the controller."
3,hmmm .... its a too small game ... well its just ten bucks !!,"the only reason you need this, is just to have a new wiimote. The game is just too small, but sometimes is fun in multiplayer ...Don't buy this only for the game!"
1,Not worth it unless you NEED another controller,"This game is fun for about 1 hour. By then you've played all the games 3 times. Tank, pool, and Hockey are the only games with any replay value. The pool controls are very annoying.For me it was worth it, because I needed another controller. I'm just glad I had that excuse, because this title is not worth the price without it."
3,You Decide,"The mini games are fun only once and will never be played again, but another controller make this package almost worth the price but not quite. Save ten dollars buy the controller seperate."
1,Basically paying $10 more for a wii remote,"If you really need a wii remote and can't find one then this is the game to buy. Overall this game is horrendous and shouldn't even have been released. I was hoping this would be similiar to Wii Sports but it makes Wii Sports look like the greatest game ever made. Save your $50 and wait for a $40 wiimote, people will be giving away this game free soon."
2,Not Worth It!,"Even with the free remote, this game is not worth the money. They really failed on this one. The ping pong (which I was looking forward to) isn't even a game, it's just volleying back and forth until you miss. The one or two ping pong shots you have to make on Smooth Moves is more challenging and fun. The fishing game, and horse game (whatever it is) are extremely lame. The shooting game could be fun, but it only has a certain number of levels, and then you're done.....boring. There are a couple of other games that are alright, but really nothing to jump up and down about. If you're interested in a game of pool or laser hockey, than buy it, but it's certainly not worth the pricetag!!!!"
5,FUN GAME WII PLAY BEST PRICE AMAZON,"AMAZON IS GREAT FOR NO TAX FREE SHIPPING OVER $25 ORDERS. I DON'T PLAY THIS GAME, BUT IT'S AWESOME, GO GET THE GAME AND HAVE FUN."
4,Fun and Worth the Money,"This game was well worth the buy. The games are simple and entertaining. This is NOT a game for hard core gamers but for people just hanging out looking for a few fun short games, this is wonderful!"
3,kids,This is a good game to let you small kids learn to handle the remote.They are simple games. Also you get a free remote.
2,Its ok...you get a remote,"The games are ok...the shooting game and fishing game are the only decent ones. The rest are a waste of money if you are over 10 years old. Take my advice, just buy the remote. Don't bother with the game...its not worth it."
3,Good for Small Children,"As an adult I find most of the games on here pretty boring, but my six-year old loves it. And it is something we can play together. So unless you have small children in the house, I would recommend just buying an extra controller by itself."
5,Wii Play,"The games are fun to play and almost more fun to watch, especially in the beginning. A great value because it also includes a remote."
3,"Mini Game, not an Actual Game","Wii Play would have been great if it was included or bundled with the Wii console like Wii Sports. It's a very simple game that consists of several mini games that allow you to try out all aspects of the Wii Remote.It's not complicated or hard to master, but has little replay value. The other downside is only 2 people can compete in the games, even though the Wii supports up to 4 players.The Wii Numchuck is not used with any of the mini games, but can be used optionally with the Tanks mini game. That was a bit disappointing because I was under the impression that the game tried to incorporate a variety of controls.Overall, if the game didn't come with the Wii Remote and was $15 or maybe $19 I would get it. Otherwise, just get it if you need the extra controller and remotes are scarce in your area."
3,Another remote is always good.,"Buy the game, get the remote as a bonus! They should have made it the other way around.The games are just a bit to finicky to be really fun. After clearing them all once, the only ones that are fun enough to go back and play again are Tanks, Cow racing and Billiards.You have to be so precise in your movements for most of them that unless you have the patience of a saint, you're going to get ticked. If you like the game, you can do it enough to be able to control it pretty well. The problem with that is only 3 or 4 of the games are actually fun enough to warrant playing repeatedly.So, buy the controller and get a bonus game!"
4,"If you need an extra Wii remote then this is the game for you, if not ......","If you are in need of an extra Wii remote then get this game because you are only, in theory, paying $10 for the game. The game is worth $10, not $50. If you do not need an extra Wii remote then pass on this one."
4,Cheap Entertainment,"Since we were going to buy another wii-mote ($40) anyway, we figured we might as well get one that came with 9 games for just another $10. It was well worth it. The games aren't as fun as the Wii Sports but some are very addicting. Our favorites so far are the ""duck-hunt"" style shooting game, the cow-racing, and the fishing game.I like the tanks too but it could be improved with more bubble-bobble-like gameplay, letting you re-start at the level you died on.But overall, if you're in the market for another wii remote, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal."
2,Um,"Wii play is only worth your money if you buy it with the Wiimote. The game itself keeps you busy for about 5 minutes. There is no challenge, and Wii Sports is your best choice for a game to play with others. If you don't need a wiimote, dont waste your money."
4,"Game is OK, second reomte is wonderful!!","I bought Wii for my wife as the Birthday gift. We bought this one for the 2nd remote to play together. The ""Wii Play"" game is OK, simple but still have some fun. I gave it four star."
2,Save the bucks loose the game,"Really, the games are nearly worthless. Unlike Wii Sports which comes with the console and is a blast. Just get another wii controller and put the difference towards a nun-chuck controller. The game disc went in once and hasn't gone in the console since."
2,The remote was the best part!,Wii Play looked and sounded good when I saw it at Target. The games in this collection are extremely basic and not Wii quality. If you are looking at this I would look at another title.
4,Wii Play,"Some of the games are goofy but fun, like the cow race. Others are regular sport like the shooting and pool. Overall worth it when you get it with the Wii remote package.Wii Play with Wii Remote"
4,some fun,Good bargain for games and remote. Most games become monotinous because fields never vary or they are very simlistic. Enjoy the billards.
4,Need another Wii controller?,"Wii Play in this form comes bundled with a Wii remote. There is a reason for this - Wii Play is not quite a stand-alone game. In fact, it feels like a primer on how to use your Wii remote, in the form of nine various mini-games. As a plus, the variety is good. Only a few have replay value past a few run-throughs. If you are relatively new to Wii, and need another remote anyways, this is a good value. Otherwise, skip."
4,Great value,"Pros:- $10 more for a game, what's not to like. The game basically teaches you the different motions of the Wiimote, but the games are fun - the cow game is insane.Cons:- None really, it's a Wiimote with a $10 game. Just buy it already."
2,Not worth $10,"A remote is a remote, but the wii play game is so bad, that I would not drop $10 on it again. Get a $40 wiimote and save the $10 for a better game, like a cheap Wario or Rayman game. Wii Sport is 3x as good as this 9 set of games. While the physic isn't bad, the execution is lame and you lose interest within a hour.Save your $10 and just get a remote by itself."
4,Great Fun...but,"It's a great deal for buying your second controller. My big complaint is that they don't include a nun chuck in the deal. So you have to spend an extra 20-bucks on that. It would be great if Nintendo had all three (wii play, remote, and nun chuck) in one package deal."
1,Only worth the remote,We purchased this mostly because of the remote that was included. I'm so glad that was our main reason as the game is very lame. My 3 children won't even play it. Definitely only worth the price for the remote.
2,Not so good,"I bought this for the remote basically. The wii play is not that great, some of the games are good. The most undesirable issue with the game is you cannot choose whichever game you want, you have to go in the order for each game to unlock. one has to complete the game before the next game opens. I dont understand why it is like this. My favorite game is last but one and in order to get there I have to play all the ones before them. That sucks!"
4,My daughter loves it,My 8 year-old daughter loves most of the games - especially the ones she can beat me at. Geared for the younger set.
3,I only bought it for the wii remote,"Well since christmas of this year, I have went to multiple stores, online and all, and could not find a wii remote, the only ones ive seen are the generic colored ones. Call me crazy but I like my things to match and the name brands. But everyone was out of them, the only way to get one was to order this game.With that being said, the game itself is a little cheesy for an adult, but great for small kids. My 2 favorite games on here is the cow race, and the hunting game, its similar to the old duck hunt on NES. Ping Pongs not bad, but I had the worst time trying to figure out how to maneuver my wiimote to play the 9-ball pool.If your buying this just for the wiimote, then great, but I wouldn't suggest paying more than 10 bucks for the game itself."
2,Great for Beginners,"I purchased this game because it came with a remote which I needed for my Wii & it was only a little bit more $$s than the remote by itself. The game is great for beginner who have nevered play with the Wii before as it teaches you how to move & operate the remote. It is done in game formats that make it interesting to do the drills. It is very simple with easy games & movements, however, you will lose interest in it very quickly."
2,Really boring,"I don't like this game, but since you get a control with it, game is almost free... better than nothing!Ducks game is not so bad... You can remember old classics!"
4,Good Deal for Both,"This is a good deal for the price. You get the controller and also Wii Play game for about what you would have paid for just one.The games are good for getting used to using the Wii controller, but some of them are very basic"
3,"Get this, its not that bad.","The games are as low-qual as most say, but the price is great, paid less than retail actually and I found this to be worth while, especially when you are in need of another remote. This is a definite buy, its not as good as wii-play by any means, but its on the right track and has some replay value.Basically, the whole concept is to ""train"" you in the use of the remote, or a lesson in how to become a ""remote master"" It forces you to play through all the games in order but you only have to play/beat them once to get the others unlocked. All 9 should be available in about 20-30 mins of play. I can't give this higher than a 3 because i'm rating the game, not the wii-mote included, but its really not that bad. Go for it if you can find it."
4,As much fun as you can expect for $10,"I bought this game for the controller mainly, so I had low expectations. It is a $10 game, after all. As a result, I enjoyed it.Basically, the game is like a series of demo games to show you have to use the Wiimote. There's not really anything to accomplish, and it's less fun than WiiPlay. Still, I enjoy particularly the Laser Hockey (a Wii-specific version of Pong), Cow Racing, and the shooting game. The pool game is horrible and not even worth it, while the others are mediocre.Remember that this is a $10 game because of the controller and you'll briefly enjoy it."
3,Okay for $10,"Just like several other reviews, don't buy the game if you don't get the remote. Games are very simple and showcase the different abilities of the remote. Wii Sports is better."
3,"Fun mini-games, just not nearly enough of them","Wii Play is a nice game for those who just bought a Wii since it comes with a Wii remote. It's a good way to get a game and a second remote. You use your Mii to play the games that include fishing and shooting range, which Duck Hunt fans from the old NES should really enjoy. Of the 9 mini-games, my favorite is Charge! Your Mii rides on the back of cow with the objective being to knock over scarecrows while avoiding obstacles.Think of Wii Play as an overprice Wii remote that comes with a game. They are fun games but just wish there were more than nine."
3,Good enough for the money...,"Obviously the draw here is that you get a set of simple games for about $10 after factoring in the cost of the wiimote. The games are all entertaining enough, but the WiiSports game that comes with console has much better quality games. The WiiPlay games were obviously an afterthought. Is it worth $10? Probably. But you can get a lot for $10 if you shop used games, so that may be a better route."
3,A Game for all ages,"Cool game for the family. The best thing is that it comes with a wiimote, so, the price is just right."
4,Great Deal!,Wii Play is great to play with kids and adults with a variety of games included and an additional remote that adds to your collection. A wise second purchase after buying the Wii console with sports bundle.
3,Not that great,I had heard that this was a fun addition and in the same style as the Wii sports package. The reality of this mini-game system and i mean mini (the game play is very short on most of the features) is that this game pack lacked true potential. The games are not set up as interactive play (like the sports) you can sit and play these...and I purchased this last night and was not impressed in the least with the quality of the games
2,30 seconds of fun,The joy of the game is to be able to beat young children who play it for the first time (then never play it with them again). You will be the Wii play master and they will never be able to take that back because everyone will agree that playing another game would be more fun. That is the beauty of this game.Don't buy unless you need a wii mote
5,Warning: these games are addictive,"I bought this product b/c I needed another Wii remote. Wii play games are very addictive, and my 9 and 5 year old girls absolutely love them. Even my wife who usually avoid my geeky toys would join us for a game or two. That's really the success behind Wii and it's many interactive games - appealing to the non-typical gamer types (girls and woman in her mid 30's). We all like Shooting, Find Mii, and Charge. The games are easy to play even my 5 year old got really good at Find Mii, beating all of us consistently. My personal favorite is Tank, which reminded me of another tank game for the old Atari 2600. I wish Wii Play was more widely publicized b/c it is that good. If I weren't in the market for another remote, I might have missed out on these games."
2,Save Your Money,I am a new Wii user and bought this on the first day. It is very difficult to play and I wished I had not bought it. I would rather have a better game for the money. :( Even my experienced video playing son hates this game.
4,Kids Enjoy It - Little Dull For Adults,"Our household consists of 2 30-somethings, a 13 yr old, and a 10 yr old. I bought it for Christmas with our Wii so we would have 2 controllers to pass back and forth. The extra $10 is worth it in my book. Us (the adults) went through all the games first - we enjoyed the target shooting game and the ping pong game - the others were either lame or too hard (we couldn't get the pool cue to do what we wanted). Then the kids played it - they are extremely good at the pool game!! So they are definately getting my $10 moneys worth out of it."
3,Great for kids,"The kids will love this game, not so much adults. But if you need a remote this is the way to go!"
2,"""Game"" is a waste..","Getting the ""free"" Wii Controller is ok. The games are idiotic. They really are. Don't waste the extra dollars for these worthless games. Just buy the Wii Contoller."
4,Wii Play,"It's not as much fun as other games, but I'm glad I purchased it, plus it came with a free remote."
4,Wii Sports alike game,"Similar to Wii Sports, but it includes some interesting casual games. I wished it had Wifi logo on it."
4,Great Deal,This remote-game combo was a great deal. The games are fun and easy to play for all ages.
4,Remote,"I bought this really because it had the remote with it, but the Wii Play game is actually not bad."
3,Controller With Wii Game,"This was a great deal for $39.00, could not beat the price. Everything was received in order and working perfectly. The controller alone was $39, the Wii game is a plus. The Wii Play is not bad. My favorites game is the billiards. This game is made for more than 1 player."
3,What's this disc doing here?,"The ONLY reason to buy this is if you want to add another game to your collection. It's only $10 more then a controller by it self. Trust me though, after playing with it for an hour you will put it away in your collection and NEVER pull it back out."
1,buy only for remote,"okay I really did want a extra remote and a game sound good too. yeah well game is geared for say a 3 year old. seriously you ride a _cow_ in a game and run down unsuspecting bouncing scarecrows. LAME. pool sucked, lazer hockey was lame too. its lame all around. except comes with a spiffy WII brand remote<not a knockoff as you often are forced to buy>so for 3 year olds its great.anyone above that might want to smack themselves in the head with the remote. or...leave off the strap and chuck the controller into the tv to end it all."
3,"Wii Play, not so much.",I got this game primarily for the remote that came with it. We don't really play it that much. I think it is worth the money because you basically get the game for the price of the remote. Maybe you would use it more but for us our other games are more entertaining.
4,Wii fun!,"We purchased the Wii set up, including the Wii Fit and Wii Play. We are having a great time getting fit and having fun at the same time. Easy to install, too."
2,Wii Play with WW Remote,"I am not crazy about the games on this one. I get that they may be trying to improve skills. My nephew loves the tank game, but that is about it. I would say it is worth is just to have the extra Wii Remote. The games are more for younger children."
3,wii play--kids love it,"our 5 and 8 year old play these games. the 8yr old like several of them, though not all. our 5 year old is less interested. we mainly purchased this as a more efficient way to get a second remote. it's a no brainer way to get another remote for the wii, but i wouldn't purchase the game if the remote didn't come with it."
2,Bought this for the remote,"I figured it was worth paying a few extra dollars to get the game with the remote, since I needed another remote any ways. The game is OK, but there's really nothing special about it. I use the extra remote way more than the game, so I probably could have saved money and just bought the remote."
2,Good for Children...maybe,Maybe this is good for children but I expected a lot more. Games are way too simplistic for adults.
3,Some Good Some Bad,The best thing about this game is the free Wii remote. I bought this game over a month ago and haven't played it in over two weeks. Just not enough to keep me interested. The best game is Shooting Range and the worst is Laser Hockey. And the Charge game is pretty funny. This would be a good game just for kids. It's an easy enough game to learn.
1,Games waste of money just by the remote by itself,"these games are terrible total waste of money, just by the remote by itself and save the extra $10 to put toward a real game.I also don't get the concept of having to play one crappy game to UNLOCK the next crappy game. I heard other games on the WII do that as well. That is just stupid if I don't want to play a game I should have to to get to a different game (rant over.)"
3,Good beginners game,"I just got a Nintendo Wii that came with Wii Sports and needed another remote so I got this bundled product. I did some research before buying it and I found that in Japan it is actually called ""Introduction to Wii"" in Japan ([...], scroll down to the part where the interview is asking why they used the word ""training for Link's Crossbow) so I knew exactly the ""quality"" of the game I was getting. This, I think, made it more fun because I wasn't expecting some wondrous game. I take it for what its worth and its a bunch of little games to show you how to use the remote. Thats it plain and simple. Most are pretty fun too!"
2,Not much fun but worth the price diff over just remote.,"The games are not that good. But for the price difference between it and just the remote by it self, it is worth the few extra $$ especially if you don't have any other games besides the WII sports."
4,A good deal,"This is great, u get the remote as well as a software for a bit more. We love the cow race best"
4,EXTREME FUN FOR THE CASUAL GAMER,"OK, so I am a casual gamer. That is OK. If you like games that are extremely fun for short bursts, like the original wii sports, you'll like this game. It is great. Most of the games are shallow, and suprisingly the tank-like game is one of the best of the bunch. But what is not to love about a decent representation of target shooting, pool, and ping pong. Come on, how deep do these need to be? Listen, my wife has gamed more in the last few weeks with the wii than she has in the last 6 years without it. That says something. Halo three this isn't. A fun game that is approachable by all of your non-gamer friends for an hour of absolute joy, this is."
1,Not worth the $10,"To me the game was not worth the $10. I wish I had just bought the remote because the games that come on the disk are so lame. I played each of the games twice, mostly because I felt obligated to use it at least a little."
5,Great Fun!,"This game is a lot of fun, it allows 2 players to become very competitive with racing, shooting, table tennis, and much more! 1 player setting is a lot of fun as well as you can play to earn medals and practice to become better for the 2 player setting."
2,Meh...,"I would have to agree with most of the reviews here.Here's the bottom line.If this was a standalone title without the WiiMote and was in the bargain bin for $10, I would have probably given it a shot anyway.At that price, I guess you're getting what you pay for.The ping pong game had alot of promise, but they spoiled it by not expanding the options. I mean, who cares about returning shots until you miss? That's a game?Billiards is alot of fun at first, but again, NO variety!One of the reasons Wii Sports is so much fun has to do with variety. If you get sick of the regular games, you have Training Mode, etc.Wii Play could have benefited from having more options and depth.With MP 8 coming out sometime this year, I needed another WiiMote anyway, so it's not a total loss."
1,Not worth $10,"If you take the $40 controller out of the equation (this one doesn't even have a silicon grip), this game is $10... and still not worth it. It's a series of silly, slightly amusing mini-games that 'teach' you how to do certain movements with the controller. For example, twisting your wrist, or holding the controller like a traditional controller. Things that would take you about 2.1 second to master in a real game. Plus, I can't figure out how to save it and in order to play a game, I must play all the ones that precede it to unlock them. A waste of time."
1,Wii Play sucks!,"At least the game sucks.. I received this for christmas, mainly because my brother and I wanted to do multiplayer games on the Wii and this had a wiimote. My brother and I pop in the Wii, and start to play. We came to a conclusion... This game sucks. The mini-games are completely boring and not worth 10 dollars at all. Just buy a seperate Wii-mote. Thats really all I have to say. Buyer Beware!"
1,Save your $10,"If you like Wii Sports and think Wii Play is going to be similar, think again. This game is not worth the $10 extra you have to pay to get the remote. The interface is awkward and the games have little replayability."
4,FUN FOR THE FAMILY!,"This was a great bundle. It came with a wii controller, which was awesome. My four year old needed his own controller. The games are cool for him to get use to and learn how to use the controller. I bought this used for 10.00 dollars, which makes me like it even more. Thanks for the purchase!"
4,Great price,Great price --I've not played any of the games but my daughter has and she likes them ok. I really just wanted the remote and might as well get an extra game for the same price.
3,You get what you pay for,"I just got my Nintendo Wii Play game with bonus remote in the mail. I was looking for an extra remote and thought I got a great deal when I found this one with a game for such a great price. When I got it today I was a little disappointed right away when I opened it up and the box looked like it was stepped on and kicked across the room... The outer packaging was fine so I assume the box was in that condition before it was sent via USPS. When I opened it up I noticed a big scratch on the front of the Wii remote and it even looks like there is some dirt or something between the remote and the rubber cover. The game is still wrapped and brand new. Despite the ""not so brand new"" condition of the remote, I still think I got a pretty decent deal... although it may be a little harder to give as a gift now, as I planned. Good thing it is only going to my 6 and 9 year old."
1,RUN AWAY!,i bought this game in order to get the extra wii controller. The game is lame and boring. And you can simply buy a controller at local Walmart at a much lower price.
3,great game with controller,this game overall is a good purchase and even better because it came with a controller.
2,Very Disappointed,"After reading the review about liking wii play if you like wii sports, I was excited to get the extra wii remote with a bonus, but the games on wii play were a disappointment. They are cutsie and do not have the competitiveness and group play that wii sports has. There really is no comparison. Knowing what I know now, I would save $10 and just buy the remote itself."
1,Worst game ever! Why Nintendo even bothered releasing it is beyond me.,"I got this for Christmas, because like many people, my mom thought that since she would be buying an extra remote for our new Wii system, the extra $10 for a game was a good deal. The reality is that the game isn't a game at all, it's a series of mini games designed as a tutorial that you must play one at a time and succeed in whatever the task is before the next can be unlocked. My mom and I each played Christmas day, but after that, the game has sat in its case never to see the light of day. Unless you think you'll really have a hard time learning how to move and control the Wii remote, don't bother with the pack, just buy the extra remote and put the money you'll save toward either a second Nunchuk or a different game."
3,wii play with wii remote,"the game came in the perfect state, in good weather and it is a game that it entertains very much and has several games. Apart that, on having brought the control, puts it in advantage"
4,"Remote is five stars, game is two.",I bought this during holidays season and the reason was to buy the controller. It was not possible to get it otherwise.So this is the whole idea for the bundle.As for the game itself - a collection of nine mini-games and there is nothing to write home about. My son switched back to Wii Sports after fifteen minutes of playing. We have never inserted the disk to the console since then.
2,It's only worth 10 bucks!!,"A couple of games on this game. The games are kinda cheezy. The shooting game's like Duck Hunt. The rest of them, like pool and ping pong, sucks. It's only worth the remote!!"
5,Wii Play,"BEST game to start off with. First you get the 2nd controller that really is necessary for more then 2 people. THEN you get this fantastic collection of games that teach you how to use your remotes in different ways. Master this and you are ready for the any of the other games, and they come to you easier in the controlling aspect because of this.Bought another copy for a friend that jsut got a Wii too. Would buy another one for next friend that gets Wii as well."
1,Purchase only for the remote,"The game ends up feeling like a bunch of free Flash games. Luckily, I bought it for the remote, not the game, so the extra $10 was no big deal. Wii Sports (which is bundled with the Wii) is a lot more fun than this."
4,Consider this a Wii Remote with a $10 game,"As many others have stated, this package is really the Wii Remote with a bonus $10 game included. You would not buy this for the game due to the simplicity. Most games do not have lasting appeal; possible 1 or 2 will be fun when playing with others. Buy this only if you cannot find the extra Wii Remote."
2,$30 remote. $10 game,"It's about what you'd expect. A couple of the games are pretty fun. The cow race and tanks are a couple of my favorites. It won't keep you entertained for hours, but it's fun for a quick party game."
1,50 bucks for a wii mote,"to sum this up, the games are more boring than the wii sports. its just a updated wii sports. wii sports is fun to a degree but this is bad. the wii remote is nice, but thats all you will ever use out of the box. so just buy the remote for 40 bucks and save the 10 extra dollars."
1,just buy the second controller alone,"the game is worthless. you need a second controller, but just buy it alone. even at $8 the game is a waste."
3,rip off,Only two games were active on the game cd. The shooting game and match game. The rest of the games I couldn't play. They would not highlight when I clicked on them.
4,great fun,"good for guys and girls. people who play a lot of games may think it is simple and not that interesting, but most will like a couple of the games on this one."
3,Lame,"This game is very lame. The fishing is fun, but aggravating when playing with another because of being in the way of each other and having the game show you every catch you and your opponents make, stopping the game in the process. The only reason I gave this three stars is because, like others have stated, it comes with the remote, so for about $10, this game is worth that, but no more. Do not buy this game without the remote!"
2,Not really worth the extra $10,"I borrowed this game from a friend. We had decided to purchase a separate controller for $39 versus purchasing WiiPlay. Boy am I glad I did!! The game play on this has been well described already by Bipi101, so I won't redo the description. Needless to say, it didn't hold my attention or my five year old son. He was pretty disappointed with it. Wii Sports is much more fun and teaches you to use the remote just as well.My suggestion would be to purchase a second (or third etc) controller separately and use the extra $10 toward a Nunchuk. I suspect that most of the games here one won't play more than a few times while the Nunchuk will be used far more often."
2,Not a great game,"I bought this game because it has a second Wii remote control inside, so it looks like a good offer to me. And it really is. It comes with 9 games, but they are created in a way of teaching, I mean, they were designed just like if they were your first Wii games, so they go through steps to teach you how to handle Wii remote. Games are also too basic in form and shape, too simple in colors and realism. In fact, from all 9 games I can say only two of them are funny, Shooting and Find Mii. All other games are simplified version of real games with lack of sophistication; Table Tennis, Tank, Laser Hockey, Billards and fishing are very bad. They just can be played three or four times, then you see they are too simple."
4,very good deal and a fun game for the family,"Our family just got the Wii for Christmas this year as a gift from the family and this was the first game we bought. A big selling point is the free controller that comes with the game. I know it's not really free, but for the price of most games for any platform it basically makes it free. The games are fun, but not too hard so everyone can play. Our favorite ones are pool and tank.All in all a very good deal and specially when it's on sale :)"
3,Just Okay. ..,"I will start off by saying that it's cool to get the remote with the game, but you could buy a new remote much cheaper! The game is okay. . .love the shooting and fishing games on there, but the rest is a waste of time. The pool table game is difficult and so on. . .the point of the game is get used to the Wii remote. . .so if you are new to the Wii, start with this game."
5,Wii Play is perfect for my very active kids!,"I purchased the Wii Play with remote because it was a 2-in-1 deal. My 6-yr old loves billiards and the games are long enough to hold his interest without having to pay for the full version of any of them. Getting a remote with it was an added bonus. I have 4 kids so I buy everything in a quads. This is a great product, purchasing through Amazon.com has always been easy, secure and a pleasure!"
3,Not intended for my son,"The games and learning process to understand the game are intended for teenager and not for kids 5-10. My 5 year old son tried learning ping pong, racing cows and shooting targets with no success. He has basically given up playing with the DVD. The add'l remote though is a godsend and we use it for Wii Sports. The price was right and we received it in time for Christmas. Thanks Amazon for making my son's Christmas a great one!"
4,Good for young kids,"We got this game really for the extra remote (since the game is only $10 more than just buying the remote). We have 5 & 6 year old girls who can easily manipulate through 5 of the 9 games. Their favorites are the ""cow race"" and ""find the miis"". It's a great entry level game set if you are trying to learn coordination with the wii."
4,Great value,"Given the fact that you get a remote with the game, this is a great value. My daughter, 8, loves several of the games. They are the perfect level for her. I would recommend this for kids and casual gamers of all ages."
5,Wii Play + remote,"not quite as much fun as Wii Sports, a little harder to menuever the remote in some cases. But if you want another remote the Wii Play is a good value."
4,Good games and great value,"I luv the mini games, they are very fun especially when you play with friends in parties. Great value with the remote!"
4,Simple fun,"I have two girls - ages 4 and 7. We bought this primarily to get a second controller but the games in WiiPlay are simple, fun and easy to master.I think the main purpose of the games is to teach the user how to use a Wii controller. Once my girls mastered a few of the WiiPlay games, they were able to play other games (ex: Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz) with much more skill and ultimately had more fun.Their favorite games are ""Find Mii"", the shooting gallery, and fishing.Summary: if you're an experienced gamer, skip this bundle. But, if you're a casual gamer just starting out on the Wii and happen to need an extra controller, I'd highly recommend getting this package. You'll familiarize yourself with the Wii controller and have fun at the same time."
2,Game not worth $10,"Like everyone else, $40 for a remote vs. $50 for remote + game = no brainer. However, I found the game boring and not even worth a second look. Ping pong? Air hockey? Really, Nintendo? The pool portion was sort of fun, but everything else is a throwback to something old (Duck Hunt, anyone?). For $10, I don't expect a lot, but I was expecting more than this. The freebie Link's Crossbow Training that comes with the gun is much more fun than this.All in all, you should buy this. It's only $10 extra, and different strokes. I, however, will probably never play this game again."
3,Just OK...,Most of the Wii Play games are just average. Table Tennis (ping pong) is terrible. The Wii Match game is interesting and good for parties. The cow race is the best game followed by tank then fishing.
3,worth the money,"If you are getting just the game... maybe not so much. However, if you're paying ten bucks more than you would for just the remote to get the game with it, it's cute. It's got about 8 or 10 mini games. Some of them are lame but some are fun. There's pool, fishing, duck hunt, cow racing, ping pong and stuff like matching games. If you need a remote anyway, I would recommend getting Wii Play with the remote for a tad more."
5,Good price,The games in the Wii Play are only ok (good enough for $10). I would recommend this package if you plan on buying the Wii Controller.
3,"Disappointing games, worth the price for the Remote","This was my first game buy after the console and expected a similar playing experience as with Wii Sports (the included game when you buy the console). I must say I was very disappointed because:1. The games are really short (Which doesn't mean some of them aren't fun)2. Just up to 2 players3. Skill level required is way below Wii Sports, making games a bit dull.I would say it's rather a game to show you what the Wii Remote can do (teach possible Remote's movements while playing).I give an overall 3 stars because of the included controller (worth the money)."
2,Disappointing Game. Wii Sports & Sports Resort Much Better,"Wii Play is a pretty big disappointment, especially considering how much fun Wii Sports is. Skip this game and get Wii Sports Resort instead. Wii Sports Resort is at least as fun as Wii Sports, and both Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort are so much better than Wii Play."
2,Simply an overpriced Wii-mote,"The games are Atari type playing games from the 80's in which one can lose interest very quickly. They may have spent hundreds of thousands of dollar in development in upgrading some Atari style games to use the advanced Wii functionality, so I guessing they're trying to recoup some of that money. The games might be geared to just over toddler age fun games. Even my youngest daughter has lost interest.I would probably give this package a 4 star if they included it for free with the purchase of a remote. It's a door prize nothing more.The purchase of a remote is necessary maybe even three so you can have four players at once, but the addition of this Wii Play game does not add (much) value to the package.My advice: Pass on the game and just purchase the remote unless you have some under 7 children that need babysitting now and then, then it might come in handy (if you've found something else to hold your door open)."
5,One of the best games on Wii--every Wii owner should have it!,"Great game! An essential addition to any Wii owner. Even if a couple of the games are throwaways (the same can be said about Wii Resort or Wii Fit Plus), there are plenty there for almost everyone. All the games also work and even more fun in 2-player mode."
2,Great for young kids,"The games here are probably great for young kids but for adults, not really worth the extra money. No real work at the games just sitting there."
2,Just for extra remote,"I was recommend to have this game and got extra remote.Although my expectation is low (Game just cost $5), the quality (scene & way of playing) is not worthwhile. We put it aside after the first round.On the other thought, maybe just spend $35 for remote and save the money for other games. Kids spend time on Wii sport and Mario more than this one."
2,Can't get to main screen,"I guess you need to play all games once to get to the main screen where you can choose which game to play. I hate that. Except for getting an extra remote, it's worthless. Don't spend money on this -- better get a remote as is."
3,Pretty plain games - bought for the Wii Remote,These games are pretty basic. We bought this game because it came with a Wii remote. It was cheaper than buying just the Wii remote. My 4 year old son likes the fishing game. The worst part is when you first start playing this game you have to play them in order.
5,Wii all play!,"Wii Play is a great game to play with the whole family, it comes with all types of games to make anyone enjoy the game and keep wanting to play. The fact that it comes with an extra control is a really big bonus! It's like your getting the game for just $5! Can't find a better deal than that! Fun to play. Highly recommended"
4,"For the controller + a game, it's a good deal.","If you need a controller, and like the sport games, then this is a good deal."
2,Returned it,The game was no fun and the controller was the simple one that still needed the more sensitive plug in.
4,Pretty good.,Basically I like to play Wii once in a while. It gives some exercise and I enjoyed it a lot.
3,A Wii Remote with Wii Play,"If you consider the price of the Wii Remote, this is a good deal. The games are so so."
5,Great!,"We bought this because it came with the remote and it's actually a pretty good game! I would recommend it to others, but purely because we only ended up paying $10 more than the remote to get the game as well. I'm not sure if it's worth much more than that, but I think wii knew this when they created the game as well :) Anyways, I would get this game with the remote to see the variety of things that the wii can do and to play duckhunt :)"
3,Wii play it once in a while.,"Wii play is worth the few extra dollars you would otherwise spend getting a remote you need anyway, although its hasn't been something we play very often. It's basically an inexpensive way to begin building your game library and provide some options."
5,Nana is finally off the sofa!!,"I love, love, love the Wii! It is a wonderful motivator! A truly fun way to move your body without being bored!!"
3,wii play,"Games are fun, learn how to use remote in different ways. From what I have played, it seems you have to work your way through the various games to get to the one you want to play. I thought once I got through the ""stages"", it would be different but does not seem to be the case. Although, I have only tried to play a few times since doing the stages. Overall, considering the price, not a bad value"
3,Free remote makes it worth it,"This isn't the MOST fun game I have, but it is worth getting for the remote."
1,Frustrating game,"The good news is you get a Wii remote and a game for only $10 more than a Wii remote by itself. The bad news, $10 is about all the game is worth. You get a bunch of tacky little games on the game disc. Unfortunately, it forces you to play each one in sequence to advance to the next level and unlock the next game. Most of the lower level games are very childish (and boring) but you have to finish playing them to access the good ones. I'm tempted to throw out this game and use the storage case for the sports game that came with the Wii system."
3,Somewhat fun,"I played the Wii play games a couple of times, and most are fun for short time. I really disliked the pool table game, but to get through it and all of the balls off of the pool table to some of the other games. It was pretty aggravating because I had trouble even getting the pool cue to hit the ball. Anyhow, my 5 year old neice likes the table tennis so we play it once in a while."
1,Worth one play only.,"After playing through each game quickly and dealing with the poor controls of the wii-mote in this particular game, you may never want to play this game again. The game is cheaply made because the price is cheap, go figure, I guess the game companies figured this too."
3,Don't waste your money unless you want the remote,"I bought it on launch day. What a waste of money. THe games are boring and repetitive. Laser hockey is probably the best, and even that is shallow."
3,Wii Play with Wii Remote,I would buy this game just for the remote. The family plays the game on it some but not much. It is a fill in when you are bored with all other games.
2,Too simplistic and weird,"Anyone over 5 or 6 would likely tire of these games pretty easily. Unfortunately, the games makes you proceed through each one before unlocking the next game.Some are just boring like finding a Mii on the screen, or racing down a cow path. The fishing game is a joke, as is the ping pong which you have surprisingly little control over (very un-Wii like). The billiards is probably the most fun, but even that has only basic play-ability. The laser hockey was interesting and provides enough eye candy to maintain interest for awhile.The 'game' seems to be simply a demonstration of some of the things you can do with the Wii remote. But even at $10 over the price of a remote alone, I feel ripped off. It should have been lumped in with the remote for free."
2,Just buy a controller,"I thought this game for an extra $10 would be a great deal... which it is. However, the games all suck. Your $10 would be better off spent in the Wii store online. Just buy a controller and don't let Nintendo swindle you."
3,Fun for beginners,"This game is worth the $10 with the remote, especially if you are new to the Wii console. This game helps teach how to use the remote. The games on here are fun to play with family, especially racing cows, and laser hockey. I would not suggest this game for the advanced Wii player or gamer though."
3,Only a few games were entertaining....,"We bought our Wii with Wii Sports Resort, and just got Wii Play. Wii Play isn't nearly as fun. The games are OK. My 10 yr old niece likes to play this game more than my husband and I do. I'm still happy I bought it just because it came with an extra remote. Wii Play has a nice variety of games... but I really only like two of them. With all the other games we have that I think are fantastic, I don't think we'll be using this one very often."
2,Good for the price,The whole package was the same price as just the remote from Wlmart. So it was worth it. The games arent all that much fun...just ok
3,Free Wii Remote,"We needed another Remote and this included it for the same price as just a remote.The games got played once and maybe somebody will pull them out again in the future. But with the Wii being new and having Wii Fit and all the fun games that came with the Wii, this will stay in the box for a while."
3,"Fairly Fun games and ""free"" remote, but remote not rechargeable","The Wii Play games are pretty fun and, for us, it's worth the cost to have the billiards, ping pong, and ice hockey (they call it ""laser hockey""). Wii Play on it's own is probably not worth more than about $15-$20, but we bought because we also got the free remote.What I didn't realize--having gotten a Wii and another remote that had a rechargeable battery for the holidays--is that all remotes are not rechargeable. It seems one has to buy a separate battery pack, which costs another $10.Nintendo seems to have mastered the art of ""make them buy more."""
4,the controller works fine,"We bought it because of the controller, so we cannot say anything yet about the games. We live out of the U.S., and it is cheaper like this no matter how you put it. The games included, if they are wonderful or not so wonderful, will be just fine, since we consider it a bonus! The controller is performing greatly."
5,This product is a great VALUE!,Great value you get 9 games and controller for the cost of just the controller!
4,SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE,fun for everyone old and young alike no matter what your preference and comes with a wii remote what else needs to be said
2,a Wii bit overpriced...,I wish I would have bought the Wii Remote by itself and skipped the Wii Play games. They are not very interesting. The only one I enjoyed off this game is the billiards game.
3,It's good fun for kids,"This wii game is good fun for kids. Although the cow riding game appeals to very young kids, it is very difficult for them to play. It woulld be nice to have more than just 9 ball on the billards game."
3,Worth it for the remote,"Mainly got this for the remote, which is as good as it can get, the bonus being the games. There are 2-3 good games on here, such as the Duck-hunting, but the rest are pretty lame, such as the findMii etc. All in all though, not bad value."
3,Almost like a guide...,"Wii Play is a big seller mainly because of the extra remote. The game itself, isn't that impressive. However, it does teach you how to properly use the Wii remote. The mini-games provided throughout the game shows the player how to aim (duck hunt), how to twist and turn while wearing the wrist strap to match shapes and even offers a memory game. It's fun the first time around, but after that there's not much to it. I do recommend you pick it up if you are new to the Wii, or just looking for a new controller. A disc of mini-games is like a small bonus."
4,"Bad game, good deal","As fun as Wii sports is, this game is the complete opposite. For starters you have to go to the main game screen to change characters, and the games are only for 1-2 players. It's a good buy if you need another remote and only plan on playing the game a few times."
1,At least I got a Wii Remote with this product...,"Wii play is a set of nine mini games with a Wii Remote.This set of nine games to me, seemed like all the games that didn't make Wii Sports and they shoved it on a CD and packaged it with a Wii Remote as a consolation prize for buying this game.Most of the mini games in Wii Play are not fun, at least for me. I'm a college student. I think Wii play may be amusing for children under the ages of 13. I think this game could be fun at drinking parties for older people.For me, the only good thing that came out of this was that I got a Wii Remote and I only paid 10 extra dollars for the nine mini games since the remote retails for $40 anyways."
1,NO DEAL AT ALL,"I played each of the games for about 5 minutes and have no desire to play them again.I would have been better off had I just bought the remote and saved $10, or spent the same amount and bought the blk MotionPlus remote as I've found the new sensor is improved."
1,work only with NTSC mode,"I have tried to run it in my Wii console which i have purchased from Dubai, but it did not work,I discovered that there are 2 models of WII, one supports NTSC and the other is not (which i have)."
1,Doesn't operate in the UK,Bought this for a relative to bring over to us in the UK. It was for my grand-daughter's 8th birthday. Unfortuantely the game does not work in the UK so it has been a complete waste of money. Sorry..........would love to rate..........would love to play it but can't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Buy it ONLY if you need the Wii Remote...,"The ""Wii Play"" game itself leaves much to be desired... It offers a couple of decent ""quick play"" games.The bottom line: It is worth $10 bucks, so buy it if you need the extra Wii Remote."
4,This is fun but not as much exersize as wii sports,This is way worth the money since it comes with a free remote. We have had fun playing these games but I really liked the sports as it gets my kids up and moving. These games are not as active and only 2 people can play so I always have one kid left out.
4,Nice game,"Very nice game, excellent for all ages - the only bad thing is that the remote does not come with the built-in movement sensor like the new ones do."
2,Great Deal on controller but the Games are basic to learn th wii controllers opertation.,The games are very basic and seem to be more to teach basic use of the Remote than really be soul sucklingiy mesmerizing... That said the games are ok basic games... BUT the kicker is for a bit less than $26 Bucks via Amazon Prime YOU get a Wii Remote Controller even if it is in White (Yetch!!)...It's a MUCH better DEAL than the $39.95 local retail stores all have them marked at... Got one of these last week it works great!! I will order 2 more ASAP... and look for a deal on the nunchucks to go with them.
3,Just Ok,This game is just okay... I purchased this for my 8 year old son. He enjoys it sometimes. It's not the game he pulls out to play all the time. It was mainly purchased for the free remote. The games lack substance. They are short and not that fun at any age. Several folks in my household have played the variety of games on the disc and all have agreed.
3,Wii Play,"This a fun game, but some things you have to sit down for and thats the only thing I don't enjoy but other wise this game is OK. But its fun once you get the hang of it."
1,Doesn't work on UK Wii console,"After receiving this package, I was so excited cause I got it mainly for the remote but when trying to play the games the Wii console could not read the disc, such games should be international, now I got my console from UK I should only be buying games from UK..this doe not make any sense, now I'll go for crack to play all games !!!"
1,Waiting for a new game,"I ordered this game for my children for Easter. It sounds like a great game and the extra remote will come in handy. Unfortunately, I cant' review the game because we have yet to see it. The game will not work in the Wii. I followed all the troubleshooting advice. Our Wii is not broken since it plays the other Wii games we have. I have called Nintendo and they have been very polite. They are sending a mailer for me to return the disc and will send me a new one. I am hoping I just got a bad disc and the new one will arrive so we can play the game. If anyone else has a problem I'd recommend calling Nintendo."
1,Christmas Gift- Have Not Used Yet,"This is a Christmas Gift, have not used yet. I am sure it will be great, nmy kids love all of their Wii games."
1,it comes with a wiimote,"""play"" should be given away free with the remote$10 for this game is highway robberymight be good for a group of drunken stoners"
3,Buyer beware..Wii required to play,I was so excited when I ordered this game and controller. Only after opening it and trying to play with it for 30 minutes or so did I realize that without a Wii you just cannot play the 9 games..I hate it when manufacturers say on their packaging 'Play it straight out of the box' that is so misleading.
5,Worth the price,"It is not such a problem now, but there used to be a time when it was impossible to find a Wii remote. During that period of time is when I bought this game. This game(with remote) is only 5 dollars more then buying just the remote. The games included are kind of silly and won't get as much out of it as wii sports, however much worth the 5 dollars, maybe more."
5,Loved it,Grandkids got a Wi for Christmas and needed an extra remote. It work just as it was supposed to. I now have 2 remotes instead of 1
1,Disappointed - Misleading Title,thankfully only paid $10 to get the second controller. it's not a game - it is 'practice' and the player is forced to go through particular rounds to get to the one they might even want to play.
3,worth the price,"if you're going to buy an additional wiimote, spend the additional 10 bucks for this package of simple but fun games."
5,Simple Fun!,"Having played this game for a while, I have to conclude that it's a fun game that's simple and entertaining. Not all the minigames may cater to one's taste but there are a few which are quite fun to play. My favorites are the tank battle, pool/billiard, ""duck-hunt"" shooter and the fishing game.I like to view this as a $10 game instead of a $50 game with a free remote."
3,Wii Play is Barely (and I Mean Barely) Worth Your $10.,"The only reason you should pick this up is for the remote. If you liked wii sports, you'll like wii play half as much. Most of the games you'll play once and never come back to. The few that you enjoy are too shallow and repetitive to be played for more than five or ten minutes. Basically, the game portion of this package is barely (and I mean barely) worth your ten bucks. If you want dozens of mindless mini-games that make good use of the wii-mote, try picking up Super Monkey Ball, Rayman Raving Rabbids, or Wario Wares. You'll be getting plenty more gaming fun for your dollar."
2,If You Need Another Remote Only,"My kids like Wii Play. I, however, think it's kinda bland. Definitely you should only buy this game for the Remote Controller. That's it. If you do that, then the game is really just an extra 10 bucks and that's about what it's worth. There are games like Pool and Ping-Pong and a souped-up version of the old Atari classic Combat (battling tanks) but Wii sports is mainly geared for the inexperienced Wii player and the games are designed to teach you how to use the Remote Controller in all its variations. I like the Pool, but there is no next level and that is annoying. Nine ball gets weary after a while, it would have been nice to unlock another version of Pool. Overall, definitely not as good as the Wii Sports game that comes with the console. Most of the games on Will play are silly. Like I said, if you need another controller, buy Wii Play, otherwise skip it.Deal With It!"
1,Don't Bother,"Go get a controller and save your $10 dollars for something that will provide more than 10 minutes of enjoyment. The games are simplistic and repetitive and, for $10 dollars, you can go buy a used GameCube game to play on the Wii."
1,NO PLAY,"The games are poor, if you need an extra controler like I did, just buy one by itself and save $10 versus buying this bundle. The games are not worth $10."
3,Wii Play,"ok as far as the purchase goes this is the most bang for my buck that i have found. the remote alone justifies the purchase. considerint the cost of a single remote the game could be pin the tail on the donkey. but if your buying this for the game and the controller is not your main focus, don't get your hopes up. i was under the impression that the shooting game was a revitilized version of duck hunt..its not. the 9 games are good for a firrst game to ge tu used to the control styles of most other games for wii. i consider this game a stepping stone most games are very child friendly and they give u another medium to interact with your miis. the pool game is 9 ball and entertaining as is the ""tanks"" and even the cow racing is enjoyable.like i said don't buy this game expecting much more then a controller and you will enjoy it , if your buying for content you making a mistake.final opinion well worth the cost of the controller and the game is a bonus"
2,Horrible game good remote(non motion plus),"got this game because it was on sale and it came with a wii remote, at the time i did not realize that the wii remote was NOT motion plus, with was a huge problem since most of my games require it. However the remote works great with my other non motion plus games and my 2 yr old can use it while i use the motion plus. the wii play game however is a total waste of money! its a series of short games as u 'beat' one game another one opens up. i got through most of them in under 30 mins, i, currently stuck at the poll one it takes too much effort for such a crappy game. im happy with the wii remote but the game sucks!"
3,Wii Play,Wii Play is just like the other games that come along with the Wii itself. I ordered this because you receive a remote and a few games for the price of a remote.
2,I agree... Overpriced remote when you add the game.,"I bought this thinking that the games would be as fun as wii sports. In a word, NO. I loved the cow racing game, but everyone should be able to find this as a $5 game as people take it used game stores. This might be okay for small children, but it is NOT an ACTIVE game. My husband and I played it once, to see what all the games were like."
3,Worth $10?,"As most have said they did, we purchased this pack for the controller, figuring that the included games would be worth the $10 extra. They were, but don't expect too much. We love the cow game (it's named ""Charge!"", but our family calls it ""Crocheted Cow""). The other games have some playability issues. One example is the billiards game. We had a difficult time using the Wii-mote in the way that is required to play the game. If you're in the market for an extra controller, this could be a decent deal for you."
3,Wii Play,The game is fine. I purchased it to get a second remote. I am satisfied with the transaction.
3,good value,"The games are fun, but not fabulous. It's a good value because you get the remote with it."
4,Great Value for the money,My son and husband love the games. There are a good variety for us to choose from. My 6 year old son especially loves the billards. Also felt it was a good buy as the remote itself is valued at[...]. I am very pleased with the purchase.
5,Buy this and not the extra controller alone,The controller alone sells for $39.99. Spend the extra $10 and buy this combo for $49.99. The games are fun; you will play games that will basically get you comfortable on how to access the controller for other games you will be purchasing.
3,Definitely worth a purchase,"Wii Play is definitely worth a purchase. If you're in the market for another Wii Remote, picking this up is a no-brainer. The games, though they lack depth, are fun to play. Single player is okay, but this game shines with a second person or at a party. The game starts out with only one game available. After you finish that game, another is unlocked. This continues until you have unlocked all nine. It took me 30-40 minutes to unlock all of them. Some of the games, like Pose Mii and Fishing are flat-out awful. The others range from average(Laser Hockey, Table Tennis) to quite good(Tanks, Shooting). So, like I said, if you're in the market for another controller this is a great choice."
5,"More of the same, but great for the kids","I'm sure you've already read this, but these games are just an extension of the ones that came on the Wii. My kids are 7 and 5 and love them all, so I can't complain. I actually bought the Wii Play because I needed the extra remote and couldn't find one anywhere, so the games were a bonus. Now I just need to get Tiger Woods '08 for daddy."
4,Got it mainly for the wiimote,Some ordinary games included in the package with the best being air-hockey and that actually feels quite realistic. It was only second set of games for me so I had a lot of fun.The included wii-mote was the main reason to get this item though.
4,Fun for the new gamers,"I think that this is a fun game if you are a beginner to the wii. For those with plenty of experience then this game will definitely be boring. But for people of all ages 8-80, this game is pretty entertaining."
3,Eh...,"Honestly I was disappointed the first time I played this game. I really liked the wii sports & thought this would be similar. It's not. Now, after playing some of the games a few more times... they aren't too bad. Some are fun, not the best, but I'll enjoy playing every once in awhile. Others are a little goofy or worse, but oh well. Besides, it does come with the remote (which evened us out to four) so is worth it for that!"
4,It's alright,"... Not great games, but 1/4th the price of anything else, and fun enough. Good way to learn the game, and some of the minigames are great fun.... I really needed another controller, so it just made sense to get the package deal."
3,Not worth the $$ for the games,"I had a $10 GC from Amazon, so I went ahead and bought the WiiPlay instead of the extra remote. After playing the games, in my opinion, it's not worth the extra $10. The pool and tank games are fairly decent...but I was unimpressed with all the others."
4,$10 game with wii remote,"The games stink but if you dont have it and you need a remote, you might as well get it."
1,antique gamer,"I', real gald I didn't pay anymore than $10.00, it's an allright game but not at all challanging and games too short and only 1-2 players. I agree it's sort of teaches the use of the remote but so does the Sports games that came with the Wii."
1,Total waste of money,"First, don't let the overall rating for this game fool you. I admit that I am not a hardcore gamer, but I do like fun simple games. However, this game (or collection of games) is way too simple, in fact I feel as though I may have lost some of my IQ just playing this worthless game. I am ashamed to have this title in my game collection, what is worse is that I can't get rid of it unless I am prepared to lose at least half of what I paid for it! Virtually every game on this CD should be rated for age 6 and UNDER as not a single game even lives up to the game collection that comes with the Wii. The only reason I may keep this game is for the extra Wii remote since it would have cost me about what I paid for this game. In fact the only reason I rated this game with one star is because the rating system would allow for 0 or -10 stars.STEER CLEAR OF THIS GAME!! Anyone who tells you otherwise must either be high on crack or is trying to sell their copy."
3,Good for the remote,"The game was probably worth about $10, which is how much more the game is than a Wii Remote by itself."
3,It is worthfull for US$10 in this bundle.,"The kids loved the cow ride, it is fun. Fishing on a farway sofa is not possible because of the useless recommendation to get close. The mII search game is very fun for kids, they enjoy it."
1,Better to just buy the remote...,"These games are okay for small children, but older kids and adults are not likely to play these more than once or twice. These games do not have the challenge and appeal of other Wii games. I bought Wii Play because I wanted the extra remote and thought it made sense to get Wii Play for only $10. If I had it to do over again, I would purchase the remote separately and use the $10 I saved to buy Wii Fit or one of the other great Wii games."
1,Save your $10,"I honestly thought, how could it be SO bad to justify saving the $10. Then I opened the box, and, after one play through, realized that I will never play this game again. It is so, so much worse than Wii Sports, so don't get your hopes up. Honestly, buy just a regular controller, and save your $10 for something else."
2,Very poorly designed games. Not worth the money,"I bought this combo for the extra Wii remote that came with it, and thought that the additional games for an extra 10~15 bucks (over the price of the Wii remote) would be a bonus. I have to say that I did not enjoy the games at all. First of all, you have to go through a series of games you may not have wanted to play before you can get to play the game you want to play. Secondly, the games themselves are very poorly designed and not too much fun at all.If you are looking to buy this product for the Wii remote, I would say save yourself the extra 10~15 dollars for the Wii Play and just get the Wii remote separately instead."
2,Wii game with remote,The games are too short. They are relatively short games. Not as good as what I expected. Some games are only up to 5 levels. Not worth buying!
2,Not worth getting.,I got this a while ago so i would have four remotes. I thought it would be a good deal because its only ten dollars more than a remote. But i should have just bought a remote because the game that comes with it is not very good. Its only mini games that is not even worth eight bucks. It does not even save it after u beat it. U have to beat it over and over again which it is kind of a hard game so its gets really boring. Even on multiplayer. The only good thing about this is the remote that comes with it.
2,Wii Play,"I basically bought this for the extra controller. I figured I might as well get more bang for the buck and get the game as well. But the game turned out to be more of a training video on how to use the controller better. It helped. Still, the extra contoller itself was greatly appreciated."
3,Remote is its saving grace,"This package didn't really hit the target with our family. We certainly use the remote regularly, but the games aren't much to get excited about. To echo other reviews, the inclusion of the remote in this package is the bottom-line redeeming factor in its purchase."
4,Play Games,My Grandkids like the games. I vote the best is the target shoot. Was a reasonable price when bought with the remote.
3,good for kids,This is a good learning game to teach how to use the controller. My kids enjoy the games
2,Don't waste your time on this.,"I give this game one star for fun, because it is horrible and two stars overall, because you get a wii remote with it so you aren't wasting that much money if you buy it.Every game left me thinking ""Why?"" Why would anyone want to play this? I was looking forward to playing pool, but it was pretty terrible. I could go on a rant about all of the problems with the game play on this particular game alone.Pool aside, all of the games were terrible. There were really only two games that I actually enjoyed playing, and I really don't feel any desire to play either one of those a second time.If you are looking into getting this because ""Hey, it's only 10 dollars more than getting a remote by itself!"" My suggestion is to not waste the 10 dollars."
3,Ok for starters,Wii Play is great for people who have just purchased the Wii and are ready to start experiencing the system for the first time. It has a few games that are fun for the family to play together but unfortunately after you get used to the Wii remote most of the games become boring. Wii Play is always good for a quick game of something between friends but it doesn't have a great replay value. It mostly feels like an introduction game.For the same price you could buy a game that has a much better replay value and enjoy it a whole lot more.
3,Only Good If you Need Another Wii Remote,"The Wii Play is somewhat fun, but nothing exceptional. You should only buy it if you need another Wii remote. Why by just the remote when you can get a game with it, and for just a few dollars more? You can have some fun times with this game, but not many. Do not buy this if you just want another Wii game. Only purchase the Wii Play if you need another controller."
4,Free remote,"I wanted another remote and thought this was a good way to get it. So, surprise the games are fun. The whole family from age 11 to 65 enjoy playing."
3,Fun for all ages,"We bought this game after we got our Wii. The MAJOR incentive is that it comes with the Wii remote. And how much does the remote itself go for? It's like $30 or something like that? So, the game itself is only about $15.Having said that, don't expect that you're paying $45 for a game. The cost mostly comes from the remote.It's a good ""starter"" game, since there are several different types of games - shooting, table tennis, fishing, pool, etc. It's pretty kid-friendly and doesn't take any genius to learn how to play the games. It's the type of game where you can play for just a few minutes or for hours.I give it 3 stars because it's not not even close to being a mind-blowing game, but it's decent. You don't have to be a video game junkie. I think that's what makes this game great for the whole family - mom, dad, little sister, big brother, grandma and grandpa."
3,Cheap Game,"I would say the tank game may be worth $5 or $10 and the others combined about $5 or $10. So it's worth the $10 more then the controller alone, but barely. They probably could not sell this game on its own. Do expect much and you will not be disappointed."
2,Ok for the $10 over the remote price,"The games initially have to be played in sequence to ""unlock"" them all. An adult with competent game play skills can do it in maybe 30 minutes.The games are ok, short but ok. They are almost like teaser games for something larger. My kid enjoys them and that is all that mattered to me, it is her Wii.What I bought was a used version of the product for about a $12 savings and the remote I got from my seller was broken."
3,Not as good as wii sport!!!,"I had more expectation for this game but it failed to deliver. Still, it has enough ""umph"" to it and free controller was definately a big plus."
4,A BANG FOR YOUR BUCK!,A control by itself is $39.99 so for $10 more you get quite a few really fun games that you can play alone or with a partner. I especially love the Pool game. It is so realistic!
2,Worth it to get the extra remote,"I purchased the Wii on launch day and was unable to buy an extra remote. When I saw that Wii Play was being released, I decided to wait. My family loves Wii Sports and this sounded like even more fun. Not so much. The games are so basic they are easily conquered. I like the Find Mii game, but it isn't that exciting. This game is worth the extra $10 over the remote if you don't have one, but that is about it."
2,Wii Play with Boring 2 player games,"I am not quite sure whether it was the fact the original games were just so great that came with the Wii, or it is just these games really really suck. I ultimately bought this pack because I needed another wii controller stat. Then I read the games and thought wow, those would be fun. I typically have at least 4 people at my house so having this pack of games which all of them are only 2 player is not any fun. I will be selling this game pack back to the store during my next trip. I will be keeping the wii controller though."
4,10 dollar game completely worth it,"Considering Wiimotes are $40 and this package is only $50, you may as well spend the extra 10 bucks and get this fun game. Wii Play is by no means the pinacle of gaming, but for $10 it's impossible to pass up. If you need an extra Wiimote you should definitely get this game."
3,Not as good as sports,I thought I would find this game just as fun as the sports game but to my suprise it isn't too great at all. I thought the pool was gonna be fun but its not a good game to buy!
3,Wii Play Game,"Great game for new players. As a ""Wii-ginner"" this game is a fun way to learn the how-to's of game play. I would recommend this for the kids (and adults) just starting out. The various games are fun, fast and teach you the various ways of using the remote. An experienced Wii-er would probably find this more than a bit boring.I recommend it for beginners !"
4,Good Value Pack,You can't go wrong with the games and remote included in one bundle. The games are OK with some better than others. A remote on its own goes for $40. How could you pass this package up?
3,"It is helpful, but not exactly a game","I had already read other reviews before purchasing, but more than anything it was nice to get the extra controller. The game is really more for teaching you the different ways to use the controller. Although, pool is pretty decent and my daughter loves the charge game. I think it was worth the money."
1,Not worth it!,"Read the reviews and thought, how bad could it be? (Needed the extra controller, for the extra $10 could get these games.) All I can advise is SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!! Buy the controller for $40 and spend the extra $10 on something that is actually fun."
4,Good value for multiplayer purposes...,"Like some reviewers stated before me, is clear that this game sold that much for the added wiimote.This is a great add on if you need another remote, and want to have a multiplayer game for a household with a few players, and since this and a wiimote cost about the same, it feels like buying a wiimote and getting a game for free, so win-win.But, do not expect the games to be great. They are good. For newbies, it will let them learn how cool the wiimote really is, and for a group it will keep them entertained, but its not a game to play by yourself.Games like tank, billiard and laser hockey are amusing; find mii, fishing and racing (on a cow!) feel like a waste of space.Need a wiimote? get itotherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Great buy,The game that comes with this is just ok but its a great value since it comes with the remote. We bought it just for the extra controller so the game was a bonus.
3,It's OK...,"This game sounded like a great deal at first with a wii remote AND a game. We were wrong. This game is NOT a good deal. Yeah, it's ok. But all of the games are only worth one play. Most of the games are boring like Ping Pong, Pose Mii, and Laser Hockey. The first time you play one of these games, it's kind of fun. The second time you play this game, (if you even play it a second time)you'll find the that quality drops. The third time, it gets really boring, especially with some of the long games like Tanks and Find Mii. You probably won't even get to the fourth time unless you really like this game.If you want a second Wii Remote, get one for 39.99 instead of a game and a remote for 49.99. More like $55 if you have a 9.875% tax in your state. Save the $10 for a better game, likeSuper Mario Galaxy 2on the Wii. Super Mario Galaxy 2 does cost around $40 on Amazon, but it is a much better value than this game."
3,Game is OK; Needed another Remote,"I got WiiPlay for Christmas which I was really excited about since I only had one remote. The games are okay, too hard for 5-6 years olds but way to easy for 25+. The multi-player function is great since we like to compete against each other. The only disappointment was that it does not come with a nunchuck! So I give it 3 stars since the game is ok and it doesn't come with a nunchuck (which costs about $17-$20 dollars!)"
1,Just buy another remote and save the $10,"When my wife and I bought a Wii for our girls, we started to buy three extra remotes but noticed that this game was bundled with one. We decided for $10, we might as well give the game a try.In hindsight, I should have just bought the remote. The games are about as entertaining as 30-year-old console games. Don't waste even $10, it's not worth it."
4,Fun!,"After playing Wii Sports I needed to see what the hype was about with Wii Play. I purchased it and I was pleased that it came with an extra controller. I feel like Wii Play is geared towards a younger audience, especially with the fishing and bubble games. It's a great product, but I found myself becoming bored quickly with it. I play Wii Sports way more than Wii Play."
1,"Well, at least you're getting a controller","Unfortunately I have to concur with many of the negative reviews here. With this game you're essentially paying for a controller and a shareware-quality game. I got it on sale for the same price as a controller, and so I consider the purchase worth it. Most the games are worthless and I was bored with them the first or second time playing them. The target shooting game provides some decent pick-up-and-get-going fun, and the cow racing is fun for the family or kids new to gaming, but overall there is no replay value here.If you need an extra controller this is a decent option, otherwise don't bother."
4,A Favorite,"Green Mountain Sumatra K-Cups are a favorite for my morning brew. Not perfect, but very good compared to some that I have tried. If you enjoy a nice bold cup of coffee in the morning, try Green Mountain Sumatra."
3,"Awesome voice, but outdated sounds...","This is Pura Fe's first CD, a collection of RnB and Jazz inspired songs. Her voice is beautiful as always, but the songs are very pop sounding and totally different than her recent work. The CD is worth buying for a few songs that stand out: Wait Til You Come Back is an awesome bluesy song in which Pura Fe laments about her distant love. Her voice reaches rare heights that are right up there with Aretha Franklin or Patty LaBelle and the background harmonies are excellent.Great Grandpa's Banjo is a Native American chant with her acapella group Ulali.Roots/Find the Cost of Freedom is the stand out track on this compilation, with native chants, drumming and an amazing version of the folk song by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, this song makes the CD's purchase worth it."
5,Understand our world!,"If only our country's leaders could have had such a great education about what shapes the conflicts that plague our history, and unfortunately, our future! A terrific presentation of the unfolding story that is the Middle East."
1,"This is NOT ""The Path to 9/11""","This is not ""The Path to 9/11,"" the five hour two night ABC/Disney docudrama that drew the ire of the Clinton administration, even though it was equally critical of the Bush administration. The producer of ""The Path to 9/11,"" Disney and ABC, has refused to release it despite critical acclaim and viewer and stockholder requests."
1,A Dazzling Display of Zionist Revisionism,"The only star this film earns is the Star of David. If the viewer is searching for cinematic scholarship he would be well advised to go elsewhere. This piece of Pro-Israeli propaganda belongs in the film library of every synagogue. It is an engaging tale festooned with rare footage of post World War I notables sandwiched between the commentary of 8 cyl. The commentary is punctuated by Pro-Israeli pundits like Thomas Friedman and the whole dialogue mass is well kneeded by a 24 ct. Brandeis University (not surprising, eh?) Zionist. The most remarkable feature of the 59 min film is the fact that the state of Israeli is hardly mentioned. The true genesis of Middle Eastern malaise remains unmentioned."
4,Can It Get Any Easier?,"Car Stereo Speaker Products Illustrated the moment I read the last word in the title: ILLUSTRATED. Finally a car stereo book that is completely illustrated with step by step procedures for all types of projects for cars, vans, and SUVs. I started reading this book with very little knowledge of how to build my own system, but now I feel confident enough to tackle my stereo project before me. Dan Ferguson really hit it on with this book! It's a must for any beginner car stereo enthusiasts!"
3,Good help for Amateurs and up. Also....,"This book may be a little complicated for begginers into the audio world. Also don't be fooled by the name of the book, this book does NOT tell you how to design and make speakers, rather, speaker systems. As in, 4-5 speakers and a subwoofer. Although, this book does touch on why speakers do certain things, along with distortions, and all those little goodies that rob you of true quatlity! It will also help you on designing different types of enclosures for all audio."
2,"VERY dated, wayyyyy to technical.","THe book is first incredibly dated. THe projects and advice are ONLY good is you plan on hand making every single component including your crossovers. Basically the book should be called "" how to build a system with no money after youve robbed radio shack."" Not a single chapter had any relevant information other than the technical basics. And for that there are far better presentations book wise. If i had known i would not have bought it. However if you are in the mood to build heavy, blocky gear that looks like you made it at home, then by all means this is the book for you."
3,Excellent Student Film,"Dark Starwas a 1974 student film by John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon. Because it is student film, the special effects were pretty amateurish, even by the standards of the 1970's. What this film lacks in special effects is more than made up by the quality of the writing. The character Sgt. Pinback, played by Dan O'Bannon, is one of the most memorable characters in all of media science fiction. Late in the film, the philosophical consequences of phenomenology are explored by an artificial intelligence that interacts with the crew of the ship."
3,"Thoughtful, funny low-budget sci-fi by USC filmmakers","Dark Star was made on a shoestring by John Carpenter with the help of Dan O'Bannon, both graduates of the University of Southern California film department. This is a better film than most ""B"" sci-fi on late night cable because there is real ingenuity and intelligence at work here. And the beach ball alien loose on the ship is a precursor of things to come -- you see, Dan O'Bannon went on to conceive the story for ALIEN and to direct other darkly humored sci-fi classics like RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, while John Carpenter went on to direct HALLOWEEN, THE FOG, THE THING, and others. An impressive little movie, shot partly on the USC campus by talented graduates only a few semesters after George Lucas was there."
3,More fun than a bowlful of Tribbles!,"Yeah, it's a campy sci-fi film. Follow it during a double-feature evening with Repo-Man, and you'll be fine."
2,Only for John Carpenter fans,"If you're a John Carpenter fan (Starman, Alien, etc.), you might be interested in seeing his early work, but if not, skip this DOG of a film. The one laugh I did get from the film was from the use of the muffin baking pan as part of the spacesuit design. It was so tacky that it was funny."
1,Dork Star,"This movie is VERY similar to the types of things you would see on PBS in terms of video quality, but only this ISN'T funny! Your money would be MUCH better spent by donating it to charity, and then staying home and watching 'Red Dwarf' for free! It'll be a LOT more entertaining too!!!"
1,Are you people MAD?,"This movie is terrible. The plot is less of a story and more of an excuse! The mind numbing ridiculousness of the ""effects"" (the are colored lights which are portrayed as aliens) and the poor, muffled sound quality make this movie the poorest I've ever seen. The only reason why it gets one star is the conversation with the bomb at the end, which even i must admit, was funny."
3,Pretty Good,"Dark Star is Director John Carpenter's first feature film. This strange talky film deals with four astronauts in deep space, who destroy unstable planets. Something goes wrong with one of their bombs. This film is somewhat dated and the unexpected ending catches you by surprise. Low budget film. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
4,RIPPED OFF FROM RAY BRADBURY - BUT STILL GREAT,"This is one of those movies in which the INTENT is far greater than the EXECUTION.If you read the novelization of this movie, by Alan Dean Foster, it reads as great sci fi, about depressed men who are slowly going crazy and beginning to hate each other on a lonely mission in space. The ending is amazingly touching, but then again, it should be since it was 'borrowed' completely from a great Ray Bradbury short story called Kaleidoscope.You'll love this move ONLY if you can overlook poor production values and see the brilliant and witty story underneath. Great production values don't actually help with comedy, just look at the recent Hitchikers Guide movie, which was disatrously blah, in spite of glossy effects.Personally, I'd LOVE to see someone remake Dark Star and do it right!cb"
4,Ha! Ha! Ha!,"""Let there be light"" -- and you will absolutely fall off your couch laughing. And you'll keep laughing till the film ends. It was just as great/funny as when I first saw it 20 years ago. Dark humor, and brilliant. A must-see for sci-fi fans. Plus, it's so short that even people who might get bored, or might not ""get it,"" should still find the time spent worth the laughs it will generate. Its [less costly](but amazing for the price) production values are its charm. This film would never work as well if it was a slick [costly] production..."
3,I was once so drunk...,"...that I actually thought this movie was great.But I got it on DVD and now I realize that it's a collection of:pedantic political humor, much of it anti-militarycheap costumes and setsa slow-moving plot that never really gets to a pointmediocre dialog delivered too fast without convincing emotiona beach ball alienSpecial effects-wise, I am amazed at what Carpenter and O'Bannon accomplished on a non-existent budget. The Spaceship and ""computer room"" effects are way ahead of their time.Still, watching it again without the aid of all that beer from my college days... This movie stinks!"
2,"With all the respect to John Carpenter, this movie is his worst","I wanted to like it, I truly did. But the movie is just bad. Almost everything in it was bad. Okay I get the plot. People blow planets into pieces that might create Super Nova's, as they go off their orbits. Okay. So what about an alien? It's a jumping orange beach ball with two legs that is filled with air. What I liked about the movie was the artificial intelligence. The talking computer on the board of the ship and the bombs. Yes, talking bombs. And the bomb #20 will be especially smart. The movie runs 1h:22mins. It is not much, but I must say that it is very slow. There is almost no action in it or performance is too bad. The movie was done with a budget of 55.000$. And the ship model was more or less beautiful."
1,"This is not art, this is GARBAGE!","I could not believe how POOR this film was (UNBELIEVABLY SO - DON'T BUY IT! ). I can usually tolerate anything, but this was SO BAD that I fast-forwarded through large portions of it in order to stay awake. What a waste .... I would have gotten more pleasure from watching Chitty-Chitty, Bang-Bang 100 times! ........."
3,"Funny, Scary, Cool, makes you go ""Hmmm...""","By this time, the movie shows its age. The music is sappy and dated - mid 1960s to early 1970s. The plot is as good as 2001: A Space Oddyssey, and this could easily have had some influence on that movie's development.This movie has many funny moments. The Alien is a huge beach ball filled with gas. The Bombs and existential discussions with them remind one of ""The HitchHiker's Guide...""The scares have more to do with man vs machine than actual threats on lives.The cool thing about this movie is how it shows the monotony of space travel. When things go wrong, it shows the apathy that grows among the crew, how they procrastinate in emergencies.If you rent or buy this, you WILL be entertained as it has elements of all the mentioned works and more: it ends with a space-surfer.Oh, and it was written and directed by JOHN CARPENTER (Ghosts Of Mars, Vampires, HALLOWEEN, Escape From N.Y. / L.A.)."
3,It was OK,"Bought it for my husband, he loved it, I thought it was just ok. Real B movie, guess it was worth the price."
1,Not what it appears to be,"When I saw this movie, it represented itself to be almost a slapstick comedy or sci-fi comedy. This movie was absolutely terrible. The characters were poorly written and the dialog between the actors was horrible. The only part of this movie worth watching is about the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. Bottom line:no action, no energy, bad movie."
1,A trip to the dentist is more fun.,"It's difficult to review this ""film"" without using four-letter words, so forgive me if I slip. This is a pile of garbage by any standards. Even if it was made in 1975, there's no excuse for it. It's complete crap in every respect. I filled 47 vomit bags while I watched it. The only reason I finished the movie is because I had more vomit bags left."
1,What was I thinking?,I can't imagine what possesed me to buy this DVD. From the reviews I was expecting something along the lines of Mel Brooks or Zucker. This is a total waste of time and money.
2,Space Madness,"Dark Star is as if the Ren and Stimpy episode, ""Space Madness"" were made into a live action film and extended into feature film length. Like George Lucas' debut THX-1138, it is a film that would be forgotten if the director had not gone onto bigger and better things. It might pass if you have a fetish for cheesy 70's sci-fi such as Soylent Green and Logan's Run. For the rest of us all I can say is give me a break. The talking voice is lifted straight from HAL in 2001. The effects are so terrible that its hard not to burst out laughing when one of the main characters have a dialogue and a fight with a beachball (!). Otherwise, it just seems as if everyone is stoned. I can forgive John Carpenter, because after all its just a student film and he went on to make Halloween, which is probably one of the best horror films of all times. I just wouldn't rush to watch this. You'll feel as if you're trapped in space with the characters the whole time. As one of them says, ""I like it up here""."

1,Why would anyone ever consider watching this?!?!?,"I have nothing good to say about this film. The acting, script and production values all have much to be desired. My primary reason for purchasing this film was it's placement in the genre of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, of which I am a fan. Unfortunately, this film has no resmblence to the Guide."
1,This movie is crap!!!,"This movie sucks!!! The scenes are laughable, especially the guy riding the ""surfboard"" into the planet!! HAHAHA!!"
4,A great B Si Fi Movie!,This is one of the funniest B movie Science Fiction movies I've come across! And so hard to find at video stores! I highly recomend it for those who like this kind of movie. The smart bomb is the best part of the movie!
3,"Great cult movie, bad production run of disc","I have been a fan of Dark Star since I first saw it on Select TV years ago. Got it on VHS, and then DVD. Was rather happy for the Blu-ray release, until I watched it. While the movie is as great as it always has been, the disc have a few minor audio defects on it (and this is on multiple discs I have tried - so guessing it is a bad batch from the manufacturer). At 102.11 into the movie, crackling sounds. Then again at 102.37. At 102. 40 is were the audio repeats over itself for about 5 seconds. Not horrible (which is why I'm keeping my 2nd copy from Amazon), but for any disc, I expect no defects. Not a happy camper. :("
3,"Old, Rickety, But Holds Up OK","Quirky, strange; but, a harbinger of things to come from the director. Having seen all that has come after it and built on its shoulders, its a struggle to watch it through. But, watch it as a part of the evolution of the Space Extravaganza's that we have today."
4,funny!!!! Take it for what it is! A low-budget college film!,"For a low budget college project film, this one was pretty dang good - and even more hilarious when you consider it was made in the 1970s! I've watched it numerous times in the theater. Now I got it at home!"
3,cheap entertainment!,bargain basement 1st feature from JC and dan o bannon has some laughs despite miniscule budget made in 1974
2,For the John Carpenter Enthusiast,"This movie is a great concept that was underfunded in the execution. The sets and special effects are cheap and I think that the editing could have been a bit tighter as some of the scenes go on too long (you don't need to experience monotony to get a sense of what the characters are going through).As mentioned by others it's a lengthened version of an original short film, and you get the feeling when watching it that the makers ran out of both ideas and money during this process. Probably worth watching but not owning."
1,Mine Broke,"Mine broke and there's nobody nearby who can fix it. It worked great for a while -- especially the color reproduction. I was amazed at the good color copying quality.Then after eight months the printing started to get really blurry, and despite following the instructions, I was unable to get it to stop being blurry.Finally, the gripper mechanism that feeds the faxes stopped working, meaning that my five page fax would all go through at once unless I tried to feed it through sheet by sheet.I think the technology in this product is good but the manufacturing techniques and design are cheap and inferior. I wouldn't recommend this if you are going to use it a lot or for your business."
4,Great For an All-In-One Machine,"Have used my 7150c for about 9 months and am very pleased overall, but I did have to get a replacement machine sent to me by Brother because the numerical keypad was inoperative (could not send faxes or place calls on the machine). Tech support was great, and they sent me the replacement by FedEx. Print and copy quality are very good (at least as good as comparable machines from HP and Canon), and the print and copy speed are MUCH FASTER than other manufacturers."
4,Very nice muti-function unit and its works with Windows NT!,"I use this 6-n-1 with Windows NT and have been happy overall with the results. Two items that I am not happy with are that the print driver when activly printing causes the mouse to work erratically and the result of frame grabbing from a video source is dark and lacks sharpness. Stand-alone fax and copy is excelent, I often use the copy mode with glossy paper to enlarge snapshots."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MACHINE,"I inititally liked the performance and flexibility of this machine, but like many others I found that the print head needed replacement after only about 18 months of very light use. At $149.99 for a replacement head from Brother, this is way too much. I'll be junking mine and buying from a competitor."
1,Print Head needs to be replaced after very little use,"I do not use my brother mfc all that much...probably much less printing than the average user. However, after having my MFC-7150C for less than 2 years, the print head needs to be replaced. The print head sells for $...!! :( I am very dissapointed with brother."
1,driver issue,The reason I am writing a review on the printer is that due to problems with the driver the printer was honestly tossed on the sidewalk with box and all since it couldnt be returned after 30 days and after not being able to configure the multi non functional anything machine printer driver.The printer was picked up and disappeared to some poor devil on the street thinking he got a freebee.My honest opinion to brother is it needs a friendlier printer driver or at least one that works.I also own a mfc brother 4600 and currently not getting anything printed out but works in windows unlike the 7150c encountering driver problems with Linux nothing prints not even in the hp2 mode.Check to make sure your driver works with the printer or OS wherever the problem is.
2,Brother 7150C - Print Head Cost,"If you purchase this machine be prepared to spend an additional ... every 18 months or less (mine lasted 16 mths) to replace the print head. Brother pulls a fast one by pricing the print head at about 1/2 the cost of a new machine. Then they only give a 3 month warranty. When you add this to the cost of print cartidges (which don't last long) then this becomes a very expensive machine to keep. I will be throwing mine out and buying a competitors brand before I pay ... for what Brother calls a ""consumable Item""."
4,PRINTING AND QUALITY COLOR OF PAGES,"Have had this machine for about a year now and have found it to be one of the best multifunctional products on the market today, One BIG DRAWBACK though is that you have to purchase ink replacement catridges WAY to fast, other then that I find it very good for my purposes."
3,A mislabeled abridgment,"This is an excellent reading of Samuel Butler's 1900 prose translation of The Odyssey; however, it is not unabridged, as it claims. Butler's translation runs to about 118,000 words. This 6-hour recording appears to contain a little more than half the text."
4,Great,This is a great CD. One of the best Makem & Clancy CD. The CD is a live recording and has the perfect mix of different tempo's. I played this CD for several freinds who thought that they would not like the Irish music they did and bought others because of this CD
3,Makem and Clancy at the National Concert Hall Live,"This is only an avarage albem, not greeat or terrible but in the middle."
5,excellent,"Exactly what I normally purchase at pet stores but for half the price, after receiving the product I have decided there really is no point in purchasing any other way!"
4,Doesn't last long enough,"The dogs love it, but it chews down too fast and doesn't last long enough for what it costs to buy."
1,Not safe,"I purchased 4 of these for my yellow lab. We usually buy the chicken flavored ones at a store, but I bought these on amazon because they were on sale. They are a noticeably different color, which I assumed was due to the liver flavor. They are also a noticeably different texture than the nylabones I have purchased at a retail store. I also noticed that my dog destroyed them much faster than the others as well. A couple days after giving one to my dog I noticed large white chunks of sharp nylon in her stool. This is extremely dangerous. I will be trying to return the other 3 soon."
2,Neither of our Goldens like it,"I had heard some good things about the Nylabones so thought I'd give it a try. We have an 8 year old Golden who's a moderate chewer, and a 6 months old Golden who's a crazy chewer. Neither of them have given this ""bone"" more than 30s of attention during the last month. I think it's just to hard dull. Based on this, and all the reviewers who seems to have problem with broken molars from these bone, I wouldn't recommend them. I think natural alternatives like beef bones and hoofs are a better alternative. I also tried an edible puppy chew (the large breed variant) from Nylabone. It took our puppy literally 90s to eat the whole thing...I expected a little more for an $8 bone to say the least..."
3,Unfortunate,":( My dog doesn't like it. Won't even play with it. I thought he would love it, but I was wrong."
3,Rated 3 stars because 3 is in the middle and I'm the author,"Hell hath no fury like a buff whose favorite model is left out! Name Withheld should know that the NET bhp for the 1972 Buick 455 was 250, not 455 or 365, etc., because the industry standard went to net bhp in 1972. Since I was off by only 25 net horsepower I will submit to a private but not a public flogging. Book is better on 1940s and 1950s Buicks than that production-line stuff. And by the way, the word you want is ""drivel"" not ""dribble."""
2,might as well burn your money as buy this book,"I was very disappointed by this book. It comes across as a low-fi look at the broad subject area of game design, more or less bereft of any information that is beyond common sense.The author (whom the back of book blurb refers to as a ""Master Game Designer"") comes across as condescending, and generally displays a poor grasp of the subject, despite the fact that he is the design director for a video game publishing company.The book seems focussed primarily on the business considerations of game design, rather than on being a useful resource for expanding a game designer's creative problem solving repertoire.If you wish to learn something useful about game design then I reccommend you purchase a different book."
4,Smiles to Out Right Laughter,"If you have been in Church very long at all, you will be delighted with Mary Chamber's work. Each page is a cartoon of someone you know from Sunday School or a board meeting. Her humor is gentle and yet can still drive a point home. This book makes a great gift for any pastor or Church staffer."
4,Battery Filler,The battery filler was received promptly and worked as advertised for a very good price. I use the filler often for my vehicles and have always been satisfied with it.
1,Mediform Soft Silicon Gel Sheeting (2x3) (box),Buy Cica-Care pads instead of Mediform. I used Mediform for 3 weeks with very little result on the scar from surgery for a torn achilles tendon. My physical therapist recommended Cica-Care pads and I saw amazing results within 24 - 48 hours. Don't waste your money on this product.
3,Don't Max the Charge,This unit works - but I find it can create leaking batteries - destroys them. It seems a work around is to not try to fully recharge. I suggest letting the batteries charge for only a few hours.
1,garbage,"I have no idea how this thing works, and it doesn't help that there are no specifications printed on it. Would it work in Europe? Someplace with 220V? Would it even matter? You have to leave it plugged in for something like 3 days. DAYS! And even then I don't remember that the charging light ever goes off. But my alkaline batteries DID get charged, I will say that."
1,Junk - Don't Waste Time/Money!!!,This can not do what it claims to be able to do - physics and chemistry simply don't work as per manufacturer claims. There's a reason why disposable batteries are in fact disposable - that's how they are manufactured.
2,Hit and miss,This seemed to be a bit magical when I read about it (recharge non-rechargable batteries!) and I think it requires a little more magic than it provides. Many batteries just didn't recharge. Caveat emptor.
1,Disturbing to Normal Human Beings,"I was drawn to this book because I wanted to read a good story about mammoths. After reading this book, I am still waiting to read a GOOD story about mammoths.This was book should be declared an ""unimaginable atrocity"" by the UN for its disgusting and pointless portrayal of animal abuse. Where is the ASPCA? Any plot was completely drowned out by the awful violence. I can't recommend this book to anyone!"
2,I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO,"This is a Crown International Picture, which produced low budget films normally viewed at drive-ins. In this case this would have been the third feature after ""Switch-blade Sisters"" and something with ""Babysitter"" in the title. Val (Karen Black) and Ken (Tony Lo Bianco) are a married couple with one son (Noah Hathaway, the Neverending Story kid). He provides her with everything she could possibly want, but she feels unfulfilled. He drives race cars and is involved in some shady car dealings. She paints naked men.When Val discovers her husband is having an affair, she has one for spite. They separate, hence the title ""Separate Ways"". Sybil Danning has a bit part as Mary, the girl who sells hot dogs. Val gets a job as a ""Foxy Lady"" cocktail waitress working for Jack Carter. The movie is rather lame and pointless, even in 1981. The script has less than B grade and it was sad to see some never actors a part of it.F-bomb, sex, nudity (Karen Black)."
4,Good Sink for the cost,"Real good deal. Not too many deep sinks out there and the big companies want $600 for similar. Sink could use some more sound deadening on it.So what, go buy some car undercoating and spray it on after install."
2,good but smelly deal,"Good size and well made sink, BUT, the sound deadening paint on my sink is a major obstacle to full enjoyment. What stench. I stored the sink outside prior to installation, hoping it would fade-it did not. Then I painted the sink which helped a little. But if I fill hot water into the sink the stench of the paint returns and makes me gag.This paint downgrades the value of the sink considerably!!"
2,I'm a fan...but,"this CD is not good. Luckily, I only paid 5 bucks for the used copy. I mean do we really want to hear incomplete songs? I don't. The couple of actual completed songs are pretty good so it gets 2 stars as opposed to the one star it probably deserves. Bruce really took a page from Gene's book here and went after the money. Should be an EP and nothing more."
3,Unfinished Album - Unfinished Life,"After listening to this album, I realize how much more Eric could have contributed if he were alive today. The album is incomplete and reflects Eric's life... great potential that was not realized. The sound is dated and of poor quality, but the songs could have been classics if they were finished. It's too bad that Eric never had a chance to release more of his originals with Kiss. Eric was a great drummer that helped take Kiss to a new level even though his talents were underutilized by the group. If you are not an Eric/Kiss fan, you won't buy this album. But, if you are, then you have to."
3,Completists should buy,"Some of the songs are just music demo tracks. There are a few good songs. It's nice that recordings of Eric Carr were released, but ""Rockology"" isn't a great album. The songs for the cartoon series are very bubblegum sounding."
2,Think twice before upgrading!!!,"If you have been using GoLive version 4 and are upgrading to version 5 because 4 was so unstable, watch out for version 5! You may first want to check the Adobe User to User Forum for GoLive on Adobe's WebSite and look at all of the problems people are having before purchasing this product. This could be a great Web Development tool, however, lack of stability and numerous bugs make this product the equivalent of driving a luxury sports car with no brakes."
3,"Edger Blade Works OK, Not OEM quality","Good replacement for original, good price, fast shipping, poor packaging allowing UPS to lose one of the blades from a two blade order but I am still a happy buyer.**11/29/12 Not the same quality as the Little Wonder blade, wears much faster and will break. Have gone back to OEM Little Wonder blade as it is a better buy."
4,If you want content and not a beginner book,"This is an excellent book for consultants and serious corp. developers. Even provides estimating tools, a framework, and serious VBA solutions. By far the best book on Access 97 I've read."
2,blah blah and more blah.,"I have read the reviews about people saying if you are serious about Access 97 get this book, that is true, but if you also want a book that praises himself (the author) about how he does this, why he does this, just what reason he had for doing that, and then actual get on to some Access 97 issues then this is the book for you. Like some other reviewer metioned, if you want a thick book fill it with pictures which this book seriously lacks."
2,Bring your pillow,Sta L. is an expert with MS Access and no one can dispute it. He also likes to write and write and write. The book moves very slowly as he drags you through a series of self praising paragraphs. At times I was convinced he was paid by the word or just filling up white space. If he wants a thick book -- add pictures.
5,Wild tattoo,This book was very interesting and wow what a surprise ending. I had a love hate realtionship with the Master and found him to be unfair most of the time but finaly understood the complexity of their relationship and how he handled the lose ends was brilliantly feandish.
2,Did not look like the photo,"I loved the photo, and the price!When I opened the box, I was disappointed that both earrings had inclusions on the top of the table (top of the stone) which were quite visible with only my eye. I am not a diamond expert and do not know if the price was good for this item or not. However, I purchased the earrings thinking they would look like the photo and these clearly were not the earrings used for the promotional photograph. I would not have wanted the earrings if I had seen them prior to placing the order. I returned them and had no problem receiving a refund."
3,"Great Printer, but lousy drivers...","I have owned this printer for about a year now. Every since the first day i have always had a problem installing it into my system. I have used it on Windows based OS such as (95, 98,ME, and 2000) each time I changed over was a headache for about three hours. As far the printer it is excellent . no complaints. They really need to make the drivers more compatible with Windows. And dont bother with their customer service, It is horrible."
3,"Needs Frequent Cleaning, Prone to Jams","I bought two of these for home use about two years ago. They see moderate, not heavy, use. Both tend to produce smudged printouts. Cleaning is somewhat tedious, and needs to be done weekly. One of the two jams fairly often, considering its light workload. I had no problems printing from Windows 2000; however, when I upgraded to Windows XP the print quality was unacceptable when using XP's default driver. Also, the printer would lose jobs if it was asleep when printing was started. After installing the XP driver from Brother's web site, these problems seem to be resolved."
5,Believe the reviews,"Very impressed with this unit. My seven year old HP LaserJet 4L died and I did a lot of research before settling on the Brother unit. The set up is quick - it takes but minutes - and the printer has both great quality and the speed it promises. The large paper tray is a nice feature (it holds 250 pages) and the unit is very quiet while printing. For the price, it's hard to imagine how one could do better."
4,"So far the little printer that can, and one that couldn't","I have owned the 1240 for a little over a week, so far it's fed 2000 plus pages without a single jam. The Xerox P8 it replaces required a constant babysitter and was a complete nightmare to feed paper that had already been through it.Setup out of the box is straight forward, driver install likewise. Noise level low, speed through parallel port almost as advertised. Print quality is excellent for text. Graphics I've not really used it for. It may even last more than 6 months :-) If you are thinking of a P8 for anything other than light home use (or need to print both sides of the paper) please try and get the extra $100 together for either this one or an NEC870, it will save you money in anger management classes later."
5,Excellent Printer!,"This is a very fine printer! I spent several months researching printers in my price range/feature list, and this printer constantly came out on top.I actually own the HL-1250, which is identical but has a little bit more RAM.The printer is easy to set up - from box to printing was about 15 minutes. Of course, after that I went back to read the documentation :)The printer is fast.It has a nice power-save mode. With everything being power-aware, I can turn my whole system on with one keyboard button. I did not measure time from sleep to print, but it was reasonable, under a minute."
5,Brother HL-1240 Laser Printer,"The reviews other owners have submitted greatly helped in the decision to purchase this laser printer over the Xerox P8. I have been using it the past week, and it is every bit as good as the HP 2100 which costs approx. $700.Monkey proof instillation procedures...highly recommend purchasing this printer."
3,Manage Your Expectations,"This is a good, inexpensive printer with a lot of features (legal/letter cartridge, and honest 12 ppm speed) normally found only in more expensive models. It handles plain text just fine, although the resolution is a bit less crisp than other lasers I have owned.The big problem is the manual feed slot. It's virtually impossible to get an envelope or pre-printed letterhead perfectly straight in it, and it flat-out balks at laser labels. (Yesterday, I spent an hour picking out bits of label that jammed.) It also, inexplicably, lacks an insertion tray that could make insertion easier and require less ""baby-sitting.""You'll enjoy this printer for light-to-moderate home or office use so long as you don't demand too much from it. But my next printer will be a Lexmark or an HP."
2,"Short, Skewed Versions of Nursery Rhymes","I bought this book because it was recommended for infants in the book ""Baby Read Aloud Basics"". I was really put off by it because the nursery rhymes are fairly skewed versions of the ones I learned as a child. Like for example, ""Ring around the Rosie"" sings ""A-tishoo, A-tishoo"" instead of ""Ashes, Ashes, etc"", which I find really bizarre and awkward to try and read. Plus, they are all cut really, really short, only a couple lines each, which I think ruins the whole point of a rhyme. These are hardly long enough to rhyme at all. The thing I liked about this book is that it is a board book, and it's small, so it's good to use with an infant. But for the sake of learning and hearing true and full-length nursery rhymes, I would go with ""The Baby's Lap Book"" by Kay Chorao (which was also recommended reading for young infants). It's not a board book, but it's hardbound, has a lot cuter illustrations, and the whole nursery rhymes are there! ;)"
1,"Wrong, wrong, wrong","We were given this book at our baby shower. As a previous commenter said, the rhymes are skewed. They're incomplete and incorrect and no fun to read to my little daughter. I do not recommend this book at all."
2,Not what I expected...,"I bought this DVD just because I saw a video of Irina Akulenko, who danced to ""Justice"" on YouTube. I expected that all performances on this DVD would be as creative as Irina's was, but I was completely wrong!Tarot cards can be very inspiring to dance to, but I assume that most of these so called artist didn't want to bother with cards meaning or choreography, as much as they bothered with costuming. The choice of music was very boring, too.The worst Tarot interpretation was the card called ""Lovers"". There are two parts on this DVD and both of them suck! It suppose to be belly dance, not salsa or jazz!Don't waste your money, just check the YouTube video of Irina, that's only performance worth watching on this DVD."
2,Not worth it,This is the first time I do not like a Neon DVD it is just not worth it. It is several shows based on the tarot cards but it was extremelly boring for me. Don't waste your money like I did.
3,Hmmmm,"Well, this video was...interesting. Very different which I expected it to be. I felt there wasn't enough belly dance in it. I know it's supposed to be more fusion but I guess I expected more. But the quality was good and there are some good dances in it."
2,Silly and disappointing,"The ads and synopses for this really make it sound like some kind of slammin' bellydance extravaganza. It is not like that at all. It is a lot of falling leaves and people pretending to throw each other around.Don't get me wrong. The World Dance New York team is awesome. But I searched my heart and soul for something good to say about this DVD and all I came up with was ""Some of the outfits are pretty."" The dances themselves are very boring and at times they even made me break into laughter.Also, the sound quality is quite poor.And as much as the goth dance was cool, the random breaking into Velvet Acid Christ music in the middle of this was just... funny. I mean, if you want comedy, by all means buy the DVD. Other than that... ""Pretty outfits."""
4,Indispensable,"For those who are not religious about their conservationism, this book is a must read. It details how our major environmental laws were developed (not as carefully or thoughtfully as one might hope) and how and why the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency came to be a voice of advocacy. You will be much more knowledgeably ""green"" after reading this fine book."
3,"Beautiful and Smooth, but Missing on One Cylinder","Generally a well-written, smooth-reading, much-detailed and well-illustrated book, the author does not seem to be examining the material. For example, she repeatedly insists that the Scythians had no stirrups. Then she shows two artifacts that show them with stirrups -- the riders on the terminals of the Kul Oba torque, and horse being hobbled on the Certomylyk amphora. Very good for compiling ancient reports, and refuting several of them, as when she uses the evidence of excavated skeletons to show that pseudo-Hippocrates' description of little, bloated, yellow men on stumpy horses simply wasn't so, or represents an odd minority. Read but do not memorize to give you a basis with visuals, then go on to Sulimirski's *The Sarmatians*"
2,"Good Pictures, Terrible Text","As has already been mentioned, the scholarship seems sloppily done and internally contradictory. However, the book does contain many good illustrations (100 photos, 16 color plates).Particularly notable are the line drawings of the tattooing on the male body from the 2nd Pazyryk kurgan, and the color plates showing schematic reconstructions of Scythian horse trappings. Of course, the tattoo information is now available on the web, and I suspect that the horse trappings are also available elsewhere..."
4,Folk? Irish?,"This quality CD combines American, Irish, traditional, contemporary, studio, and live cuts. This thoroughly enjoyable set just might define the term ""hootenany"" to those too young to have experienced the 50's & 60's. A unique CD worth every penny."
5,What happens when 2 gifted musicians get together.,"This is really a wonderful collection of Tommy and Liam together. If you never had the chance to see two giants in Irish music, then this CD will provide a glimse of what it may have been like. A terrific mix of ballads and traditonal irish songs. Their unique musical talents and signing compliments each other and each song. If you are undecided as to buy a CD from Tommy or Liam, this CD is definately the one to go with."
3,So so,"This is a sweeping theme. Plants have been of immeasurable importance all through the existence of mankind. The book is nicely printed with quite good photographs (although these fall short of being superb). The pictures are supported by brief texts, that touch on a wide body of classical, nordic and celtic mythology. A book of this kind needs an author that either has a superb command of language or an excellent grasp of the topic. Neither seems to be the case here.A clear error that I spotted is with the ""even ash"". As the reader will know ash has leaves that are ""odd pinnate compound"". Finding a rare aberrant leaf (even pinnate) is counted to be lucky. The author quotes a verse that starts ""Even ash, I do thee pluck, Hoping thus to meet good luck"" but apparently failed to read this himself, instead coming up with the ... explanation ""that plucking an ash leaf brings a boon"". This sort of error does not inspire confidence in an author."
2,Not worth the money,The towels are okay but the logos are a VERY flimsy decal that will peel or wear off with even light use. These towels are for decorative use only.
4,Bird's Eye View,I have had this product previously for a considerable length of time. The original was getting rather fragile so I was in an anxious search for a replacement. The compact size makes it very handy for travel. I will probably order another in the near future so I have an extra on hand. It is invaluable for the search for the errant eyelash in the eye and keeping wandering hairs plucked.
4,Fantastic CD!,Love this CD -it has all of my favorite Punjabi songs!Good variety of Punjabi music - brings back a lot of memories.
2,Not strong enough,"I bought this for cupcakes, I wanted a light peach flavor, not an artificial, or intense flavor, so I was hopeful when I smelled it and smelled only a soft trace of peach. The first batch of cupcakes I made using 1/2 tsp...you couldn't not even taste the flavor or peach. I made a second batch with 1 tsp (all that was left in this little dram). There are a hint of flavor, and that was it. No one who at them, could tell what the flavor was, but that there was something trying to be there. I really wanted to make light peach cupcakes, without the weight and density of adding real fruit, but I think that is what I have to do."
5,A Christmas present for my mother,"We couldn't find peach flavoring *anywhere*, and Mom desperately wanted some for baking/making ice cream. Thankfully, I found this product in time for Christmas, and she loved it! I can't wait to try whatever she plans on making."
3,Mixed Results,"I bought this unit for the sole purpose of spraying a shower with my homemade daily cleaner. I know that sounds silly but I got tired of the overpriced cleaning fluids and piece of junk spray bottles available at the stores.Unfortunately the red plastic spray button broke after a few months of use. The unit still works since the black button did not break. But the black button locks the sprayer in the ""ON"" position which means I waste additional chemical trying to turn it back off. The unit works fine otherwise."
5,"Not too heavy, doesn't hurt my hands","I use this to spray weed killer in my yard. It works very well, not too heavy, I don't have to keep squeezing the sprayer because you can lock it on."
4,it's ok,"i used it for about a month now. it was ok since D-1 but if you have a tiny garden area, then this is for you, oh yeah. but i have a large area to cover in my yard (apprx 4~500 sq.), always need to refill twice everytime when i spray my yard. it's not for me though it is well-built sprayer."
4,Great sprayer!,"I bought this for herbicide application to cut tree stumps and with the long nozzle there's less herbicide loss/use. A few pumps is all it needs to spray, adjustable nozzle is a little hard to adjust with the plastic cone on, but I have big fingers. The trigger works easily compared to other brands. Great product."
5,True love DOES exist,"This was one of the most endearing love stories i've ever read. Spence and Lila are old and worn, but the love they have for each other is still pure and fresh, forty plus years after their marriage. That a love like this might exist, and the characters are so real that it is likely, gives me new hopes in life"
4,A Wonderful Short Novel,"This is a very short novel about a rural couple who have been married for more than forty years and the confusion and stress they face as the wife is hospitalized. It is a refreshing alternative to more popular and yet more sentimental stories that deal with spousal, parental, and sibling relationships and the conflicts associated with aging and mortality. Mason is a fine writer."
4,Deep Love Expressed Without Words,"This novel has a lyrical quality which is a rarity in this minimalist style of writing.The story consists of reminiscences of a married couple of their lives together -- happy and fulfilling -- as Lila goes to the hospital for a mastectomy. Spence is unable to speak words of love but the empathic quality between them makes all understood. Theirs is a love of depth and substance.Mason makes too much though of the 'aw shucks' country folk quality. Otherwise, this is a fine book."
2,Misleading and a pain,"I bought this for my son to play with on a day we would be traveling. Big mistake. It has a ton of pieces, took a long time to put together and has only one superhero, Spiderman. I thought the picture was incredibly misleading. I mistakenly assumed all those superheros would be in the box. To top it off, it is almost impossible to keep together. My boys like to carry the playset from room to room. Well it's not designed to do that. It continuously comes apart, and then of course, I have to put it back together. We have a lot of Spiderman toys, this is one of my least favorite."
3,"Wonderful guitar play, poor recording","I have been looking for Iberia played by guitars for a long time. This is a wonderful transcription and guitar play. Unfortunately, the sound quality of this CD is not great. It sounds thin and cheap. I wish they will rerecord and reissue a CD."
5,Most Inspiring Album in Years,"When this album was released it was a God send. This album was the album people were waiting for years to come out. It pleases everyone from Master of Puppets fans to Iron Madien fans to Converge fans to In Flames and Emperor fans. Inspiring, intense, and beautiful. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
3,I think I see a Pattern,"Follow me on this one. Metallica first came out with Kill 'Em All. It was good, but did not have great production,and they were not yet at their peak. This is Shadows Fall's Kill 'Em All. Their first album with Brian Fair, who I do admit to be a fan of no matter how much Lamb of God fans say he sucks. Needless to say Jon Donais has some killer leads, and not to be out done Banchand does do some harmony stuff once or twice a song to with Jon to show he could keep up with him any day of the week. Jason Bittner was also not as polished as he is now, then again none of these guys are as good on this album as they are on Thoughts Without Words, or The War Within. Some call The War Within their sellout album, like The Black album with Metallica. I just think they got better. These guys have a solid decade of metal ahead of them. Their best though is deffinatly The War Within."
3,Greater things to come,"Despite all the positive reviews for this album, my opinion is that they didnt find their feet until The Art of Balance. Of One Blood is what got them thier needed attention and other than Crushing Belial(despite the talent thay have) this album is boring. The songs sound the same and when Brian Fair sings in his clean vocals they dont fit with the music...buy TAOB and their new album The War Within...now those are some good records!"
3,shadows fall...sicker than ever,"""Of One Blood"", the latest CD from New England's Shadows Fall is a vast improvement over ""Somber Eyes to the Sky"" the band's previous release. This CD is the introduction of Brian Fair (formerly of Overcast) on vocals. This CD is basically ""Somber Eyes..."" Part II, as the band re-records a majority of the original album. Brian's vocals are a great addition to Shadows Fall who are tighter than ever. The CD is worth a listen by any fan of underground metal. These guys are destined for greatness."
1,Poser metal,Production is hollow and these guys are trying their hardest to sound like AT THE GATES (SLAUGHTER OF THE SOUL era.) Saw these guys live...BORING!
1,More junk,"Why do bands like this all want to sound the same, get some originality already. This is harrible. 1 star, less if it was possible."
4,Favorite growing up,"This was one of my favorite books my mother read to me when I was little. Gosh, hard to believe that was 58 years ago."
5,WWMD?,"I just played the new album and I love it! Not being a big ""goth"" fan, I was taken back by the bass playing on the tracks. When I choose music for services now, I think to myself: WWMD? What Would Moe Do?"
5,YOU'RE the one that's CRAZY,"So today at 10 am there's a knock at my door. Fearing the worst I make no sound. Then I spy a paper being slowly slid under my door. After waiting another 5 minutes I pick up the paper. It's from a door to door census person. He wrote that I could call him or else he'd be back in a day or 2. You still think I'm crazy? The tax system, police, and the court system are all in cahoots on this census thing. They're trying to ferret me out. Their plan WILL fail. The next time this census guy comes back I will be Mr. Moe Felipe (Bassman Extraordinary), who is watching the apt. for one Scott who is ""on vacation"". Their attempts to assimilate me will fail."
3,marcy weight bench,"It's true, you get what you pay for. For beginners, this weight bench is great.It comes with 100lb weights and a curl bar.You can also use weights for legs.I also like the fact that you can adust the bench from sitting to flat.I don't care for the fly bars.( if that's what you call them) They are too far away and cause strain on back so you have to go light on these weights."
5,LICORICE AND PEPPERMINT WHAT A COMBO,"A Alright With This Tea Loosen Your Stomach Muscles With a Cup of this Awesome Tea YOGI STOMACH EASE.Thanks For Your Helping Hand to Convenience Me.Recommended for the rehabilitating person of any strenuous activity on abs.Recipes that really work on your stomach to bring to relief feeling,and there is more than one way to spell relief and we all know that,and so try this tea it does that with Capitals spells R-E-L-I-E-F like crazy, wild,and if you like licorice taste for its also healthy for the bod,then you'll enjoy like I did when drinking and perhaps say something like I did,after you tried, Peace, Love, and Yogi I Find It to be that way, Enjoy!"
5,It Works,"I've been drinking Yogi teas for a couple of years now. Just happened upon it at a health food store and wanted to try it. The medicinal Yogi Tea line is fantastic. It does exactly what the box says it will do... which is strange because I have tried many medicinal teas that have not given me any type of immediate or noticable results. I can have a tummy ache, drink a 6-8 oz cup of Yogi Stomach ease and half way through the cup my stomach ache is gone. The same goes for their bedtime tea: once I drink a cup I can lay down, close my eyes and I'm out cold and in a deep/restful sleep. This stuff is way better than the supermarket celestial seasonings line. Twinnings or Traditional Medicinals don't compare either. One important thing to be aware of regarding the Yogi line: these teas are spicy and heavy. Many of them have spices like cardimom, cinnamon, black licorice root, stevia leaf... some even have black pepper listed as an ingredient... they're loaded, but oh so good!!"
1,Not for me,"It actually made my stomach worse. Might work for some people but it wasn't for me. Unfortunately, now I have about 8 boxes that I will not use."
5,Truth In Advertising,"As promised, this book covers bookbinding with a plethora of materials and it is written so that almost anyone can pick up this art, even without past expertise or pre-existing knowledge. A good book."
3,"works fine, though it doesn't tilt","It's quite sturdy with the legs not extended, and light and compact enough to fit into the largest kind of backback that fits carryon luggage limits. My only complaint is that the head doesn't tilt--it only swivels. The product was advertised accurately, so this is my fault. But I'd really like a travel tripod whose head tilts--it's a useful feature, since you need that to take vertical format pictures."
3,hands-down interesting.,"this book was interesting and i enjoyed it, however, i felt that the ending was rushed."
1,I would be upset if I actually paid for this!,"What the heck is this? The music is the first disappointment, and this is not season 2. The episodes are mixed in with a later season. For reasons like this one, I really try to get DVD's from the library. I am so glad I didn't buy this. The picture quality is good to me. Maybe because I am older than when the show originally aired, the show seems slow to me. I have found this with some of the shows I actually bought, like the Dukes of Hazard and Greatest American Hero. They just aren't the same. I rate Baywatch as a 1 because of the changing of the music and because the shows seem like they are in random order."
2,Disappointing picture quality,"The picture quality is worse than that of the reruns on TV [Analog Cable, ""Low"" definition]. The fact that the show is from the 90's isn't an excuse - I've bought DVDs of show from the 60's [some of them ""colorized"" B&W;], and they look much better. I agree with all the criticisms about the theme - even if they couldn't get the rights to the original theme, they still could have found something much better.Hopefully when they release the other seasons they'll do a much better job."
1,The big cheat,"Don't get me wrong. I love BAywatch, but I simply can't watch the series on dvd. I feel like I just threw money away, like being cheated on. The theme song has been altered, as have the end credits. And as if that wasn't enough, many of the music clips during the episodes, have other songs. It simply doesn't work, as I've come to love the music montages. I want the true show on dvd, with the original music and montages. If shipping to the US weren't so expensive, I'd ship the three season I have straight back to Fremantle. This is not what I paid for. I guess I'll have to buy the German version."
3,its not the same but it is,"the seasons are out by 1 the 1st 2 episodes are missing and the original music has been replaced. and is total off the action of the credits.But the video and audio is good, pitty you have to wait and buy all of the 10 syndicated seasons to get the full network one, and how long until the 1st 2 episodes from pack 1 and 2 and by the looks 3,4,5 are released, or are they just going to be released as movies"
2,Deathstalker Return- put me to sleep,"I enjoyed the previous books in this series however I found myself fighting to get through this one. I'm sorry to say I didn't make it, At the half way mark I gave up."
3,Skeleton of the subject,"As an important American figure on the outside of Germany working in Switzerland, Dulles might have given us information not found elsewhere. Instead, he merely provides sketches of the important conspirators, gives some background, explains their part in the plot to kill Hitler or coax the West to support an overthrow of the Nazis, and explains that the conspirators either escaped the ensuing manhunts after July 20, 1944, or that they were tortured and executed. He provides a short description of how the Church was reduced to passive resistance, how the Germans might have chosen the East for salvation rather than the West, and how even Himmler and Goring aspired to step into the Fuhrer's shoes. The book is a mere skeleton of information found in greater detail in other books, especially Hans Gisevius ""To the Bitter End."" If you need your books brief and to read like outlines, this will serve. If you would prefer to read something like an insider's account, try Gisevius."
5,FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!,"I've waiting for this special to come out. I taped this special way back in 1980.my copy is kind of poor looking now, glad its finally coming out on march 20.dont know what the bonus features will be. MPI has done a great job with lucy's other dvds.as of 2/6/12 i found out one of the bonus features will be bungle abbey a pilot lucy directed in 1981.ive only seen 2 very short clips of it. the pilot is about a group of monks. with gale gordon and charlie callas."
4,Good blow by blow recounting of an est weekend,"This is basically a play-by-play story of an est transformational weekend. Written in third person. Knowing how the Landmark Forum is run today, it's interesting to see what conversations still persist today, and what pieces have been cut out. If you are a fan of transformation, I recommend this book."
5,The Best Book Written on est - - - but don't read it,"I took the est training and the Landmark Forum currently being offered. This book is the best in giving one a sense of what takes place. I would suggest that one take the current program before reading the book and using it to help relive the experience. It's more fun if you don't know what the magician is up to before seeing the show - though you'll still ""get it"" anyway in the parlance used. Since the book is so rare to find, this probably won't be much of a problem for most anyway."
5,Interesting...I read it as a critique of est...,"...and was actually convinced never to go near est or any of its incarnations. I like to think I'd be one of the few who in the first session, upon being offered their money back, would go to the back of the room and claim it on my way out. I give this book five stars, but for the opposite reason that many reviewers did."
5,Great overview of the Satir Model,"This book is a great in-depth review of the work of Virginia Satir. Its simple, concise writing and decent illustrations make it a wonderful way access the beliefs and therapy techniques of Satir. If only all psychology books could be written this way! I learned a lot and enjoyed the process."
3,OK product,"After I tried this product, I find out that the jacking pipe is short & weak. I need to use a galvanized pipe to extend the strength to use it."
5,Order It,"This is a great buy. Please read the instructions first after unpacking. My wife loves it. Looks good packed in the truck. My case was not damaged. However, Super glue works well on this type of molded plastic...should the need arises. I say order it.This is an up date. I just recieved my second jack from this seller my case was not damaged. Similar jacks at auto stores are sold in cardboard boxes at a higher price. I am sorry to read reviews about damages and other problems. Just keep the case. When you on the road with a flat or some other concerns or trying to help someone else...using the jack will be a priority. I say for the second time order it."
5,KPT 5,"I have KPT 3,5,6 and KPT effects.This is fun stuff. I like 5 best, mostly because of fraxplorer and fraxflame. Very Addictive"
3,It's plastic,"Based on the picture and price ($$$!), I expected a product with a bit more heft and quality construction. It is a lightweight plastic item, that can't have any heat-dissipating properties. I'm sure it does the job as intended - haven't had the chance to hook it up yet."
4,Historical Atlas of the American West,"Initially I was disappointed as detailed maps of counties and territories of the American West are not to be found in this book. That said though, maps such as the expansion of the railroad, migratory patterns of buffalo, discoveries of ore, etc. all more than make up for what I was originally looking for."
5,Q2 Quake,Q2 is a collection of levels for Quake. The add-on contains over 100 independent single-player & multi-players maps.
5,A honey of a book,"This is not the type of book I would ordinarily read, but because a friend gave it to me, I read it and was pleasantly suprised. I developed a strong interest in the characters and how they interacted with one another. I even cast them in my head preparing for the movie. I liked the setting and the unexpected events that I had not predicted. In the end I was left feeling that I wanted more...a sequel to carry on the cast of characters I had become to care about."
3,Chef's Hat,"The hat is attractive. It has velcro to make it adjustable, but the velcro is set the wrong way and sticks to the wearer's hair."
4,Walk through landscape,"I did not hear them before. I even didn't know them. I was caught up on Italian names. After knowing Paolo Conte, La Banda (Italian brass band), Piccola Orchestra Avion Travel I started to be curious about their music. Gianluigi Trovesi (clarinets) and Gianni Coscia (accordion) play into your mood. It really seems like you know all those melodies included on the album. I treat it like a tribute to various people, tribute to country or to place where you listen to this. Try to liste to ""Minor Dance"": there is gypsy music, there is also bit of tango (""...til they sore""). If you like sunrise mornings in the mountain, you should listen this soundtrack. If you like empty night streets, you should listen this soundtrack walking around. Trovesi instruments reminds me Jan Garbarek sound. Coscia accordion will take you to Paris(?). Go ahead and take Django (you know him)and you're gonna get unspecific swing. I enjoyed it really a lot. Or very much. Whatever. You will too."
2,Item received was 3rd-party generic,"Item received was a 3rd-party generic and not the Panasonic OEM specified in the listing, which seems to becoming all-to-common place anymore on Amzn."
1,Full of typos and missing words,i only read Dubliners but it was full of typos and missing words. this should have been much more carefully edited.
2,James Joyce,"Not my kind of reading, although I haven't read all of the collection. It just seems kind of strange as far as that goes."
5,deja vrooom!,"I have only been a fan of king crimson for about 2 years. it all started when i saw deja vroom on VHS. i was instantly hooked. before i even owned any cd's of theirs, i purchased deja vroom on dvd. it was an experiance i can't forget, and a purchase i don't want to. about a year ago i saw king crimson live in milwaukee, i was only maybe 10 feet from the band. it was my first concert ever, and im glad it was! they played quite a few songs that were on the deja vroom, and they sounded exactly the same, awesome. i'm a 22 year old guy, who was amazed by a bunch of old musicians that not many people i know have even heard of. immediately, i began to spread the word, but not many people bought into it. if you want to see an amazing dvd, or an amazing band, king crimson can do both!"
4,"Great DVD, great performance","The recording of this performance was very controlled and well engineered from both a visual and audio standpoint (care of Discipline Global Mobile). The band performs flawlessly (as expected). There's no artistic editing of camera shots and angles of the performance. The tracks are separated though, like on a audio CD. You never really see the audience. You can even mix and match sections of 21st Century Schiziod Man from different lineups of the band!"
2,JENSEN&#65533; AM/FM/CD/MP3 PLAYER,"THE BEST ON THE MARKET FOR THE PRICE...WITH ALOT OF REALLY""COOL FEATURES""...YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU BOUGHT THIS ONE FOR YEARSTO COME..! THIS UNIT IS REALLY 200 WATT'S..! (NOT 15WX4)"
3,"Description wrong, 1 pair pre-amp RCA's only","Description says 2 pair front/rear and 1 pair subwoofer RCA pre-amp outputs. Even the box says so as well as Jensen's own website. The unit only has 1 pair total, not 3 as advertised."
4,A Must to Play,"Without the proper codex to play your Warhammer 40k army, you aren't going to get very far. It's always good to own these to make sure you are up to date on your points, as well as knowing the rules that apply to your army. The book looks beautiful, provides backstory, and the pages are nice. The only issue is that the binding style is one of the weaker ones and does necessitate caution and care of the book for it to last a long time."
4,Hard cover or paperback? Not clear,"Whilst its not clear on their information, this price suggests its a hardback, which for some reason I thought it was. In fact it is a paperback book for $27.99So not such great value for money. As these are used extensively by kids the price should either reflect its a paperback or be hard coverHowever book arrived well packaged and in excellent condition for a new paperback bookI will be a little bit more careful with this vendor next time"
4,Live & Funky,The cd is very live & funky. Val Watson has a great voice & the band is really tight. I especially liked the cameos by Bootsy Collins & George Clinton. It was an enjoyable ride.
5,Words & Music to touch the heart,"This recording takes a look at Phil Coulter's 25 years in the music business. His talents include writing, producing and playing Irish music.The CD includes Coulter's musical arrangements of well-known Irish pieces such as 'Will Ye Go Lassie Go?' and 'The Nightingale'. His musical version of such songs maintain the traditional yet offer an updated sound.The CD also includes renditions of Coulter's own songs, some sung by the artist himself, others by noted musicians. Two songs deserving special mention are Coulter's 'The Old Man', a heart-stirring tribute to a father from a loving son, and 'Scorn Not His Simplicity', a tribute to a child with Down's syndrome. Coulter's 'The Town I Loved So Well' aptly portrays the changes war has brought to a town in Northern Ireland.Althought Coulter's music has deep roots in Ireland, many of the songs will speak to people from all backgrounds."
3,Playboy: Helmut Newton.,It's OK. Not the definitive Newton work. Better than nothing.Just a another piece of the Newton puzzle.Julian Wasser
1,big upset,"I wish I had looked at more of the reviews before purchasing this, I was deeply upset with this product and hope others will read these reviews before purchasing. Wish I could give a better software suggestion but I'm still looking myself."
2,no support,"I purchased Videowave 5 and am unable to burn mpeg files to CDs. I get a message ""Couldn't burn to optical disk"". No other help. MGI has not replied to repeated emails over a 3 week period and their online registration fails to respond with a registration number. Other users have reported similar problems. Save your money and buy a product that has support."
1,Terrible,"I bought and upgraded to version 5...no go. 'Cannot transcode file' errors. Buggiest program I have bought, no support, no return policy. Lost money. Caveat Emptor"
1,Don't buy this!,"Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product.I purchased VideoWave 4 and installed it on my Win2000 PC.It captures video from my Sony camcorder fine, but that's it.I can't edit any files (not even the sample files that came with the software). The icons and menu items for the editing functions never enable themselves (they stay grayed-out) and the ""help"" and the skimpy manual have no information on this.I tried to go through a tutorial in the manual and could not get past ""step 2"" because the menu option would just not become available.The free support online is very, very poor. And I have heard awful stories about the attitude and lack of helpfulness of the expensive pay-per-call support.I am sorry I bought this!"
1,This software ...!,"How's this product suppose to be a ""entry"" software when I can't figure out a damn thing. Wouldn't locate my camcorder forever, until one fateful day. Once I got some video in I couldn't even see my entire video. I had to look at each section like I captured it until I rendered the whole thing for a preview. Might as well finish my movie 7 times over before I get it right. It's got this cool ""blue screen"" effect that I could put myself over other video. But it kept making me transparent or a color in my cloths or something. .... I just wish I had that the first go-around. I plan to post my praises of VideoStudio under that product shortly."
4,Beware Installation Routine,"Great Product but beware the installation routine.I'm running W98 SE and during installation the installer changed the file winaspi.dll without notice with an older version, causing loss of the digital audio stream capability of my system (bad if you want to edit DV videos).After couple of hours I was able to restore everything."
1,Decent product with bugs and no support,"The product appears appealing though simple. Although the documentation and tutorials are skimpy, with enough effort one can figure it out. The problem is it crashes every time I try to save my editing result. And there is no help in producing VCDs. The troubleshooting guide and online help are silent on the problems I am encountering. The company does not respond to email requests and requires payment for telephone help."
3,Good and bad features,"Captured my digital video easily, stores everything in a neat library, the Storyline with drag and drop makes editing intuitive, transitions are easy to create, sound editing easy to master. Manual is nearly worthless--had to buy a separate book that covered VideoWave. Help files just as bad. Final production snagged repeatedly and gave no clue why. Most irritating is that any effects can't be viewed until the video is produced, which is very time consuming. I'd check out other programs first...it's possible that this is the best you can do in this price range."
2,just...not good really.,"For starters i have no idea why this band is on Trustkill. I know labels have to have a diverse roster...but this sounds really nu-metal (gag) to me...which is not good at all. I guess Open Hand is trying do do some sort of rock in the vein of HUM (one of the greatest bands ever...) but they really arent good at it. I really tried to like this band but they aren't good. The lyrics are cheesy too. Musically i dont get this album...it seems like its trying to combine genres but doenst to it well. The drumming is almost straight hardcore, the guitars/bass remind me of pop punk and numetal, and the singer...just doesnt fit at all. Plus the random acoustic guitars aren't well placed/needed. This band seems to have a lot of potential but i really am not into this album at all. Maybe some other time."
4,16 songs listed here (nice background music),"Track Listing1. The Last Rose Of Summer2. The Cliffs Of Dooneen3. The Isle Of Inisfree4. The Green Glens Of Antrim5. The Flight Of The Earls6.

2,I'm confused...,"""Allow yourself to be enveloped by the love within and all around you. Know that you are constantly giving birth to the divine love within you..."" (p. 81). And so it goes, page after page of this pap.Where is Jesus?Don follows the path of Carolyn Myss and Mirabai Starr (Don recommends Starr's books)in gutting our saint's writing of anything centered on Christ the Beloved.If you are looking for good meditation material truly faithful to St. Teresa and her Inner Castle, try Muto (Where Lovers Meet), McLean (Towards Mystical Union), and Humphreys (From Ashes to Fire).BTW: The 2011 paperback by Don, Meditations with Teresa of Avila, appears to be a reprint of this hardcover."
2,Too New Age,"I waited eagerly for this book. St. Teresa Avila is such a wonderfula nd inspirational woman for all times. After only a few paragraphs, I was worried and ultimately, I could not in good conscience continue with this book. I cannot in good conscience even pass it on. It became part of the landfill.The questionable statements began in the prologue. The author apologizes for calling God ""He"" and invites the reader to substitute whatever title they choose. This was my first major red flag. The last time I looked. Jesus was a HE and God the Father seems to suggest that the male pronoun is appropriate.As a devotee of St. Teresa of Avila, I am appalled that she is a vehicle for this less than true to faith book of so-called Catholic mysticism.Mysticism is a subject that needs a well grounded author."
5,Falling Into the Atms of God: Meditations on St. Theresa of Avila,It is an excellent meditation book on the spiritual nature of our lives. It is a thoughtful and thought provoking look at our lives through reaching inward toward our soul.
4,A foundational challenge to anyone's ideas of marriage,"Biblicaly based, this book packs quite a punch. I like the approach the authors in that they go right at the tough stuff, peeling the hard layers back and examining the philosophy of marriage from God's point of view. I also like the fact that they not only deal with the common problems but even get at the working of the soul and the friendship or ""alliance"" that should exist in a marriage."
1,"If You Want A Good Marriage Book, Look Elsewhere","Yes, this book does have some good truth in it. In fact, all of that truth could be printed on one or two pages instead of the 364 that are contained in the book. It is the equivalent of looking through the trash to find your dinner.I am not sure who benefits from this book. However, it is not suitable material for regular people. It is best left to professional marriage therapist who enjoy diagnosing strange scenarios.For Christian individuals seeking a good marriage book, try a more mainline author such as Dennis Rainey or James Dobson."
1,Too fluffy,"While there are gems of truth hidden in this book, they are mostly hidden under fluffy sayings. The authors could have said the same things much more to the point."
4,Nice for your fusion,"I found the warm-up a little too rushed, but younger dancers won't have a problem with it. This has a good intro to hip hop. You need to have a little bit of belly dance under your belt to go through this smoothly, so having the basics down will help you out a lot. I have to mention that I am very glad that not all belly dance videos are geared toward beginners. We need lots more geared toward intermediate and advanced. If you like fusion, perhaps this is your next step up from being a beginner. Happy dancing!"
5,"life affirming, quirky, wise","This is a wonderful work of quirky characters, ups and downs, life affirmation, and wisdom. The book covers the first year in the life of the heroine, Rosemary O'Neal, after the loss of her lover of eight years, William, to suicide.The writing is sensuous but distant as Rosemary recalls growing up with her family and her time with William. Her relatives and best friend from college descend on her, filling her guest rooms, and driving her out of the house to live in a tent on the hill for peace and privacy.She uses the year to answer questions about William and about herself, and emerges calmer, stronger, wiser, and whole again to carry forth.I identify with the ups and downs of dealing with the memories of family members gone, and other cherished experiences lost to the past, and the challenge of continuing to deal with the present and with others and to grow. It is a gentle, poignant, beautiful treatment that leaves us whole, like Rosemary, to carry on."
3,"OK, But Didn't Grab Me, & Couldn't Stick With It","Nicely written, an easy, flowing read, and possibly would have liked and stuck with this book at another time in my life, but I became increasingly bored with the characters and situations 1/3 of the way in and had to let it go.Sorry this is another partially read/non-scientific review, but if I don't log this, I'll pick it up and try to read it again in another 10 yrs when I've forgotten I've already tried it once."
3,Good companion to Graham Hancock's books,Graham's books are wonderful however I was expecting more from this then I got BUT I would still recommend this series for anyone who is trying to find out the truth of some of archeology's greatest mysteries.Also seeThe Message of the Sphinx: A Quest for the Hidden Legacy of Mankind
5,Beautiful pictures!,"As a new mother myself, I was so excited to find a book all about a mother trying to find a job to help support her new family. And of course, as I came to the end of the book, I was disappointed to find that Edwina decided that being at home was the only true job for her. BUT... I love reading this book to my little boy. The pictures are so beautiful and captivating and the rhymes make it such a fun read. Despite the final message - which isn't really that bad - I had to give this book 5 stars."
5,"Pictures almost out do ""Edward the Emu""!","Wonderful pictures (again), and nice rhyming text. Mom goes off for work after leaving Edward to warm the nest/eggs. After trying several jobs, Edwina tries being a waitress, and has someone order EGGS! She decides that she and Edward should share the parenting duties from then on."
5,Speaking up for this wonderful book.....,"I had to write and speak up for this wonderful book. The pictures and text have captivated many students as well as my own 5 children.The adults that we share this book with roll with laughter at the great pictures and *awww* at the special relationship between Edward & Edwina.Its commendable that an author would show us that often times we mothers search for our *worth* outside of our own families, when in fact we are tremendously valuable people for putting our *first* efforts into raising our children. It is refreshing to see the story end up that mom and dad will take equal roles in raising thier children together.In rebuttal to the *Unintentional controversy* review : Any book could be seen as controversial depending on what your personal slant is.The nice thing is that nobody in our country is *Made* to read a book they dont care for.I just thought that someone should speak up for this wonderful book. Its not just for children either =0)"
4,Good stuff,"This is a good collection of World of Darkness stories. ""Wolf Trap"" and ""Glimpses of Before"" were really good, probably the best ones in there. I was very disappointed, though, that it states on the cover that it includes stories about mages and changelings, and not a one even mentioned either. Still, these are top-notch tales."
5,Brilliant,I love this book as it is in the style and humour of Jane Austin and her characters. More more more please
1,"Too much romance, not enough mystery, but this is a first book.",The book club (author was chosen) decided to pass on further interest due to inadequate mystery and too much unnecessary blood and gore.
5,Love Lady Emily,"I simply adore this book! Lady Emily is a fascinating character, set in Victorian England, a lady who lost her husband before she could love him, and now desires to learn more about him, and his interests. The story takes us to Paris where we meet famous painters and soak in the essence and ambiance of Paris, back to England and Lady Emily's growing fascination with Greek antiquities. Enter some romantic men, each of whom is very interested in Emily, and some murder. A wonderful melange in which to spend a restful, entertaining weekend. I'm on to the second in the series now! Try this one first!"
2,Too stupid to live,"I really enjoyed the beginning of this novel, the setting and the details of the role of women. Then, something happened. The heroine began to act like an idiot. She blames herself for not loving her husband--but he never courted her, was off in Africa or Greece or in the midst of an intrigue. Then she falls in love with him after he dies--neurotic. THEN she ignores the clues from one man and accepts the worst about a man she has no reason NOT to believe and trapses of to Africa with (SPOILER!) the bad guy. WHY didn't she go to Greece as he husband suggested? Never answered. She had little motive for much of what she did, just bounced around from place to place. I really wanted to love this series because I adore historical suspense, but I don't want to spend more money to be so disappointed."
1,Implausible and Inconsistent,"If you want to read a romance novel, not a mystery, then you may enjoy this book more than I did. The plot and its resolution defy logic. Worse, the heroine seems to jump back and forth between the centuries in her acceptance and rejection of cultural norms for women. Sometimes she is a Victorian romantic, yet at other times she is a woman of the 21st century in her opinions, decisions, and ideas. It was terribly inconsistent. I know complex characters are unpredictable but this character as well as the storyline just didn't add up for me."
3,Good thing Jane Austen is dead!,"If Jane Austen weren't dead she'd sue Tasha Alexander for plagiarism! This was a light, fun-enough read, but there were times when situations and/or phrases were so incredibly close to those from Persuassion, Emma and Pride & Prejudice (yet much less masterfully done) that I had to steel myself to read them. I think this is best read if you aren't an Austen fan.I do agree (with the book jacket)that it is a bit like Jane Austen meets Marc Brown, just not as well done as either of them. Still worth picking up, just keep your expectations in check."
2,Bland and forgettable,"I read the Deanna Raybourn books immediately before this one, and Ms. Alexander's effort pales in comparison. Her protagonist is obnoxious with her self-centered musings and deliberate offensiveness. The surrounding characters are one-dimensional and cliched. The villains are easily identified early on. Yet somehow I was compelled to continue reading, so I gave it two stars instead of one. Read Silent in the Grave and Silent in the Sanctuary for a far more interesting take on Victorian society."
2,"Don't be misled; ""A Novel of Suspense"" it is not.","I'm amazed at the number of 5 star reviews this novel has received. I can only surmise that these are romanace novel readers as this story really fell short for me. On the cover, under the title, it says ""A Novel of Suspense."" For at least the first half of the book, I couldn't find a lick of suspense. Then when you finally get too some mystery, it's lame, poorly conceived, and, well, lame. The ending is anti-climatic and rather cliche, I think. I would probably give this 2 and 1/2 stars, but since I couldn't, 2 it is. The writing is decent, but the story is disappointing. If you like fluffy romance novels where the heroine is both unbelieveably gorgeous and witty (and always right) and the men dashing, you might like it though."
2,Disappointment!,"I bought this book because the author went to school near where I live. What a disappointment! I hard the hardest time getting into the book, it took until page 185 until I couldn't put it down. Too much talk about society and being married, needed more mystery and suspense."
3,A good read,This is an interesting take on the times when women were not allowed to be independent. I like historical novels and I love mysteries.
2,Not for me,I can't understand those who say they couldn't put this book down. I couldn't wait to do so. The tedium was unbearable and the sophomoric writing needed a good editor. I gave it two stars because the plot could have been clever if its unfolding hadn't been so predictable. Six more in the series? No thanks.
3,"good book, not Elizabeth Peters","A good quick and fun read. Like the references to Homer and discussions revolving around that. The back of the book states that ""fans of Elizabeth Peters will welcome this debut novel"". I am a huge Peters fan and prefer the quick wit and brilliance of Ameilia Peabody and her other female characters as opposed to the slow build-up of Emily's intelligence.Overall, it's light and entertaining but will look forward to more Peters!"
2,Trite and predictable,"This reads like the work of an amateur novelist who has spent too much time reading Jane Austen and is obviously in love with her own heroine. The pseudo-Victorian writing style and the main character's supposed wit, charm and progressive thinking are very stilted and unbelievable; all of the supporting characters are uninteresting, one-dimensional stock figures; and the ""mystery"" itself is implausible and laughably developed. One thing I did enjoy was the inclusion of 19th-century museums and academia, although it was somewhat awkwardly played out, so one extra star for that. On the whole, the entire book is so cliched and formulaic that I actually found myself enjoying how bad it was. This is a good book to read if you're looking for something silly - not in content but in execution."
2,Disappointing,"I was so excited about reading this book because of the great reviews. I was so disappointed. The heroine was annoying and the ""intrique"" wasn't compelling at all.If you're looking for a well-written historical romance, try anything by Madeline Hunter or Lisa Kleypas."
2,A Very Silly Book,"I thought that maybe this book would be a much of a fun romp as Deanna Raybourne's Lady Julia books, but frankly I just wanted to spit on this book after finishing it. I gave the book two stars because the plot moves along briskly, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about it. The main character, Emily, is not believable either as a British person (the author is American), or as a historical character. She comes across as a silly, immature girl (who is supposedly the most beautiful, fabulous, and generally attractive girl in the entire world, plus super, super smart)who while not obsessing about her wardrobe gets together with her girlfriends and solves a mystery. I think the author meant to portray Emily as a proto-feminist, but that really falls flat. Maybe a fun read if you're a tweenie, but for me it just seemed shallow and silly, and full of endless whining about Victorian mourning clothes."
3,Same cover?,"Has anyone noticed that this book has the same cover as the book ""Bedlam: The Further Secret Adventures of Charlotte Bronte"" by Laura Joh Rowland?"
3,Good but not Great.,"Intriguing plot. If you enjoy ancient art, greek, the details will hold your interest, as it did mine. Art and a victorian mystery in one. Nice read not great."
4,Tasha Alexanders series of 19th century European mysteries.,"This series of mysteries in 19th century Europe is well researched and beautifully described, with snappy dialogue and interesting characters. The heroine, Emily, is independent, intelligent, and intrigued by the situations in which she finds herself, and the stories are interwoven with the mores and manners of the era. Very enjoyable reading."
2,"Thin, thin, thin",I just read 75% of this book and now feel 75% dumber. I have never felt the need to leave a review on Amazon but must warn Unsuspecting Historical Mystery-Romancers not to get sucked in by the lovely cover art. You WILL NOT CARE what happens to these characters and will inevitably give up. Read instead: Diana Gabaldon (gold standard) or Deanna Raybourn (very good). I wanted to like you Tasha!!
4,"A good plot, an easy read","Easy to get in touch with the characters' feelings, main character seemed a bit too gullible in places. You can tell it is her first book. I would definitely read the next one."
2,There will be no Book 2 for me,"Boring. I bought it because I'd heard an interview with the author on the radio and was intrigued. Ended up skimming the last quarter, just to say I'd finished it."
3,Tepid,"I picked up this book because of similarities to the Lady Julia Grey series. Both are set in Victorian England, and both feature intrepid young (widowed) women who attempt to solve mysteries in their households. However although the description on the back cover of this book looked interesting, it didn't live upto that promise. The mystery itself turned out to be kind of tepid, and the character of Lady Emily Ashton didn't grow on me. I found her petulant, wishy-washy in her decision making and someone who didn't think things through before jumping to conclusions. Also, this is Victorian England, so women are expected to behave a certain way, in keeping with feminine decorum. Emily voices many times the fact that she finds this stifling and challenges some social conventions in her own way (much to the horror of her very traditional and annoying mother), but I didn't find that the independent streak lasted very long, and seemed rather superficial."
4,Enjoyable and Clever Victorian Mystery,"Lady Emily Ashton is less than upset when her husband Viscount Philip Ashton dies on an African safari. Although he seemed a nice enough person, Emily did not love him, and the marriage was, for her, one of convenience, a way to have a home of her own away from her overbearing mother. So it is with much surprise that Emily finds herself falling in love with her husband through his journals, which she has begun to read. She also learns that in fact, her husband was very much in love with her. As she learns more about her husband the more she wishes to have known him better while he was alive. Soon however she begins to suspect Philip may have been involved in black market antiquities, and it's possible he isn't really dead.A clever Victorian mystery, I enjoyed the character of Lady Ashton and the mystery of the antiquities. I enjoyed seeing her character grow and change through learning of her husband's passions and had a good time reading the book as well."
5,My New Favorite Author,"I loved Tasha Alexander's writing style. It was so smooth and the story was so lovely! I couldn't put the book down. If you like period writing...especially 19th Century, you'll really enjoy this book. I also love Emily, the main character. She's strong, fun, independent, but also flawed and easy to relate to. I love this book and a Poisoned Season. I will be reading A Fatal Waltz and any other Tasha Alexander book."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"I picked this book up on whim, mostly because I've been getting more into historical fiction (thanks to Phillipa Gregory) and I love mysteries. I finished this book quickly as it was a light read and fun story. I enjoyed learning about the cultural traditions of the time and Greek art used for the mystery. The mystery and suspense were fun, but not as deep as some other mystery books I have read. I loved the quick witted commentary between the characters and found the writing as such I couldn't put the book down. As mentioned earlier, the story was more fluff than some other books I've read, but I enjoyed the writing so well, I ordered the second book in the series. I recommend this book if you are looking for a light mystery/suspense/historical novel (but I would not pay the full price of $14 listed on the back of the book)."
4,A Good Tale,"I like this book a lot. Easy read, characters are interesting and look forward to reading more in the series. I like Lady Emily she is a bold female for her time. Her mother is true in description and character and even makes me mad! Good travel on plane book."
2,Disappointing,"In this book, Lady Emily tries to unravel the mystery surrounding her husband's death on safari in Africa. Ms. Alexander writes that she was interested in portraying the intellectual awakening of a Victorian gentlewoman, while creating characters who were true to their times. Unfortunately, Lady Emily's intellectual excursions stall the narrative and prevent it from developing much suspense. For a woman who is supposed to be clever, Lady Emily often behaves in ways that are tiresomely stupid. And the experienced reader can tell from the first pages which of Lady Emily's gentlemen friends should be trusted and which are trying to deceive her. Even as a romance novel, this book fails to create a romantic hero who truly seems capable of engaging the heroine's heart -- he is just a pretty face."
4,Whirlwind of Victorian Suspense,"The subtitle ""A Novel of Suspense"" is certainly no lie here. This delightfully Victorian novel whisks the reader into the world of Lady Emily Ashton. Lady Emily is rich, beautiful, and fiercely independent. Her journey takes the reader from London to Paris to Greece, and gives us lively characters and a suspenseful story to intrigue us. It is truly enjoyable to follow Lady Emily as she discovers some wonderful, some starling facts about her dead husband, Philip Ashton, whom she barely knew before he passed away and attempts to discern the puzzle he left behind. The only thing lacking in this book would be in the character of Colin Hargreaves. Although he is a handsome, intelligent man, his character is not as strong as one would hope the suitor of Lady Emily might be. This is altogether an enjoyable book, and the next in the Lady Emily series is definitely on my reading list."
4,nice light yoga,"It is alright if you are wanting stretching type yoga, it does work well to help reduce pain especially in joints and muscles."
2,a couple of design flaws,"We've had this toy less than a month. While I like the look and the fact that it's made of wood, we've had two problems. First, the top of the toy - the red ball - does not screw onto the stand. Hence, it's hard to put aside or away neatly; as soon as it's disturbed, it easily falls and everything comes undone. With a little training, you get used to always picking it up from the base. The real problem is that the pole that holds the rings and is affixed to the base broke! It is held on by some sort of elastic/string device, and it snapped apart from the base. It's so inexpensive that it's not worth the effort to send it back. I may try to screw it together. Most likely, we'll just a buy a different brand."
5,Lovely Learning Toy,"I love that the rings actually go in the rainbow order of colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple. The colors are vibrant. The pole bends away from the base, so there's some flexibility. My son loves this toy and has played with it since he was seven months old (minus the pole base). If you have a dog, I would recommend watching them closely around this toy. For some reason, my dog chewed on two of the rings. Maybe because of the vegetable dyes or the rubber tree wood? I still think this is the best stacking ring."
2,Not good for young babies,"I read all the reviews saying the Plan Toy Stacking Ring was small, but I didn't expect it to be THIS small. It's like a miniature stacking ring. My baby is 7 months and putting all his toys in his mouth, so I liked that it was made of wood and safe dyes. However, being that it is made of wood, most of the rings have wood grains that are not sanded down completely smooth. It's rough around the edges, and can even scratch delicate baby skin and lips. I'm putting this toy away until he's able to play with it without putting in his mouth."
2,I'm not so sure about this.,This book started out really good then went downhill after 100 pages (about).I just couldn't stick to reading it. I lost interest completely and couldn't finish it. What a waste of money?! Bummer.
1,Poorly Written,"A book with such a simple theme shouldn't be hard to follow, and yet this book digresses on nearly every page with flashbacks galore. It was a cute idea for a book, but frankly between the poor writing style and the caricatures in lieu of charachters, I wish I hadnt wasted my time trying to read this."
4,A good debut album,"First off, I have to correct the previous poster: ""Thiaroye"" is NOT El Hadj N'Diaye's first album and the follow-up to ""Xel"" but it's his FIRST one. They were only published in reverse order in the US. For a first album it is pretty strong. N'Diaye didn't have the American market and taste in mind when he produced it, he put it together the way people in his native Senegal and France (his major market) like it. I admit, the album is an acquired taste, and it took me a while, too, until I got into the groove but once I had listened to it several times over I started loving it. By all means, give it a chance!"
2,Mediocre Afropop,"This album is disappointing when compared with N'Diaye's earlier ""Xel"" album (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED). The songs are bland, the progressions are weak, and the instrumentation is lackluster (especially the percussion). Avoid this & stick with Xel !"
2,Production Ruined By Drum Machine,If it were not for the drummer in Diblo's band having been replaced for this album it would likely be one of my favorite albums. If you don't mind electronic drums ignore this review. If you can tell the difference a real drummer makes you are likely to feel aggravated listening to this.
2,"steer clear, mcd fans","this record is terrible. it's almost unlistenable, actually. after watching the Murder City Devil's documentary, i was excited to hear what spencer moody had done next. but this cd is the very definition of knock-off vanity record. 6 covers, perfomed sloppily, and recorded horribly. for completists only."
3,not what i thought,"The bag itself is good quality. However it seems much smaller than the description led me to believe. There is no room for a sandwich to lie flat in the bag and there is little sideways expansion to the bag. As a snack bag, it's OK. As a lunch bag, well, maybe I eat bigger lunches than the seller expected."
3,slightly disappointed,The appearance of the bag is beautiful and the color is great. it is small and can fit a small Tupperware and a snack or two. Food stays cold. My disappointment is that the lining of the small compartment ripped already and I had to sew it back together. Cute bag though for a simple few items on the go.
2,Cute but Useless,"I bought this bag because it was super cute.. I bought the Grey Plaid, and it looks like a normal purse... but it's mostly useless. I can't put anything in it, its too narrow to put normal tupperware right side up, and its not flexible enough to make something work. If you are a true--make a sandwhich and put a piece of fruit and and soda can person it is probably fine. That's not me, I usually pack leftovers or a lean cuisine. Doesn't fit so great, and I can't put my water bottle in either.Nice try, but it didn't for me."
1,too small lunch bag,"This bag is very cute, but way too small for a lunch bag. It is made well and probably will last a long time, but I will not be using it."
3,"Cute, but too small","It's well-insulated and pretty to look at, but I find it too small to hold tupperware. So if you're looking to carry a salad or rice dish for lunch rather than a sandwich (which, in it's flatness, would fit well), look elsewhere."
1,Too small for practical use,"I bought this bag so I could have something more stylish in which to take my lunch to work. However, it's really too small for practical use. You can't even get a sandwich-size Glad container in it and still close the zipper! Forget being able to get a small frozen dinner (like Lean Cuisine) into the bag.It was a complete waste of my money."
2,LEAKY,"I got the bag on time and it was intact and very cute. Can accommodate several containers. But.. my water bottle unfortunately snapped open. The bag leaked like a sieve. Literally. Not just at the seams, but all along the base of the bag water was dripping out. I am now looking for a new bag because what is the point of having a lunch bag that leaks."
3,Good idea but.....,The bag needs to be a little bigger! Instead of 12 x 6 x 8 inches make it 13 x 7 x 9. Otherwise I love it!
2,this thing is ugly.,"This looked really cute online but it's hideous in person. It's way more rectangular than the photo shows, not cute and square-ish. Anyone who complains this thing isn't big enough just eats too much -- it's huge. A huge, ugly, rectangular lunch bag. When my husband walked in today and saw me pull it out of the box he actually commented that it was the ugliest purse he had ever seen. For him to comment on something he thought was a woman's accessory item, it has to be pretty darn ugly. The dots aren't white either; they're light pink, just in case anyone is wondering. I'm not sure why the title says they're white when they obviously aren't. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because you can easily fit a lunch...and dinner... in the bag. I guess it will come in handy when I have to bring tupperware lunches (but I usually don't need a bag for a tupperware...). Otherwise it's kinda too big for just a sandwich, chips and grapes or whatever. I think I paid too much for it."
4,Stylish lunch tote,"I ordered this about a month ago and I love it! No more bringing lunch to work in my recycled plastic grocery bags and forgetting to put it in the communal refridgerator. Now it doesn't matter, most of the time all of my food fits in here plus a small ice pack.The only con I've found, I mustn't have read the fine print, is it is not waterproof. IE. use reusable plastic ice packs and not plain old ice. I made the mistake of using ice one of the days and it leaked."
4,"Cute lunch bag, not enough space","I really love the way this lunch bag looks. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have much room at all. If you pack a sandwich you are fine, but I like to take my home cooked meals to work which take up more room because of the container. I usually end up taking my water bottle in hand because my lunch barely fits in the bag. It is very beautiful though and would be perfect for those who only carry a sandwitch, chips, fruit and small drink. It also seems to keep my lunch pretty cool as well until lunch time when I pop it in the microwave. I don't know how well it would retain warm food though."
3,Nice little lunch bag,I like this lunch bag. I only wish it was just a little bigger and that the handle straps were longer. The picture does make it seem bigger than it really is.
3,Smaller than it looks,"I ordered this bag becuase I thought it was a lot bigger than it appeared. I did read the reviews and they mentioned it was small, but still a decent size. It's smaller than I imagined. I do like the bag, but I wish it was bigger."
2,Super cute but way too small,"I love the looks of this lunch bag; in fact, I've gotten compliments on it from people who thought it was a new purse. However, it's just too small to be of much use at all. I typically pack a small breakfast, lunch, and a snack, but it's too small even for just a lunch. It's so narrow that I can't fit in a sandwich-size tupperware container. And there's no hope at all to fit a freezer pack with food containers."
5,Great lunch box,My 14 year old daughter carries this lunch box to school every day. She loves the style. She is an athlete and therefore eats quite a bit. This lunch box holds all she needs during school as well as a snack afterwards. It's a great size.
4,lunch cooler,"I like the bag and have received many compliments on it. My only complaint is that I could have used a larger one. Had I seen it in person I probably would not have chosen it for that reason, but if you only carry a small lunch, it will probably be fine. I can't fit a large salad in there, but can certainly fit a sandwhich and a fruit or two without a problem."
5,LOVE IT got the Giraffe Sachi,"Works great, Love my bag coming back to buy another. Keeps my lunch cold until i am ready at 12 ish. still had ice in my little ice packs."
3,Lantzbug,"Very cute, but way smaller than what you would expect. I purchased a lunch holder that by the dimensions should have fit, but it definitely will not."
3,stylish but thats it,I bought this bag wanting a lunch bag that was cute but now that i am bringing my lunch to work more and I have found it doesnt hold enough. I put food in tupperware and want to be able to fit it in the bag but it barely zips up. It could be bigger or more giving to the shape of different things but then i guess it wouldnt be as cute lol. This would prob be good for a child as they usually just pack sandwhiches and such.
5,Sachi 21-083 Leopard Insulated Lunch Tote,"I absolutely LOVE this lunch bag! It holds luch for myself AND my two sons. I take them once a week to attend music/drama classes in the day time. I didnt wanna take a boring old luch bag, so I ordered this one. THe ladies I eat with absolutely went gaga over it! I love the size, shoulder strap and overall design. It has an outside pocket, and handy inside pockets for smaller items. This lunch bag is for me to carry, my sons dont want too, lol. But thats fine with me! You wont be sorry if you order this bag!"
3,Smaller then looks,"The lunch bag is very cute, and is well insulted. However.. its small.It doesn't fit but one container. I am going to use it, not for lunch butto sneak beer in the movie theater."
1,Mine arrived ripped... :(,"I was so excited to get this lunch bag. When it arrived, it was ripped. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it, etc. Not worth it. So disappointed."
5,Receiving lots of compliments!,I love this bag!! I work 13 hour days and have 2 lunches. My sweet husband packs my lunch for me. He loves that this bag has enough room for 2 full lunches without cramming everything in. I have received a lot of compliments on my stylish lunch bag! And it is made very sturdy. It is definitely not a cheaply made product! I love it! Highly recommended!
5,Perfect for city life,"You just can't live in NYC and bring lunch to work in a plastic bag! I searched the web for a practical yet fashionable lunch bag, stumbled over this, and am so glad I did.It carries like a small laptop bag, doesn't look wide - but has plenty of room inside, and the little ice pack kept my food chilly all day through! My only small complaint is that the second zippered compartment is very narrow; I've started using it just to pack tea bags and water flavoring and it works perfectly for that.For an example on the roominess inside - for lunch everyday, I usually pack a sandwich, plastic bag of crackers, a couple triangles of Laughing Cow cheese, an apple, banana, and my water bottle - without anything getting smooshed. I've also used theFit & Fresh Lunch on the Gosandwich box in this, and while it's a little tight, it fits.Enjoy!"
2,Quality control?,"This is a cute lunch bag. However, on the one I received the handles were sewn on incorrectly and were of two different lengths making it impossible to use. I sent it back."
5,Awesome,"I love this bag. I was carrying a really awful lunch bag from Walgreens and I wanted something stylish and functional. This is it. I was a bit concerned about size, but it holds everything I need it to (ex. two round Ziploc bowls, 1 bottle of water, 1 small coke) with room for more...and it's in my favorite school colors. Very glad I purchased this bag."
5,Beautiful,I bought this as a gift for my coworker and it is beautiful. I really wanted to keep it for myself but I have a vcute Satchi lunch bag. She loved it!
2,Just okay,"I've had this for over a year and I have to say, it's cute, but totally impractical. Aside from fitting a sandwich upright in there, there's no room for anything else like Rubbermaid containers. I will be going back to my big clunky lunch box...at least I can fit my leftovers in that =o("
2,Cute but Too Small!,"Yes, the bag is very cute, but what good is it when you can't fit much in it? I have other Sachi bags that I carry every day. This one gets zero use because I can't fit anything more than a sandwich and a small bottle of water in it. There's no room for tupperware items. Even a banana gets smooshed. I would say... don't bother with this bag, and look for one of their larger models."
5,A fashionist lunch bag!,"Very nice bag and for my needs the size is just perfect: I can carry my lunch, a Niken Sport water bottle and my makeup!It is hard to believe it is only a lunch bag!"
3,"So cute, just not big enough","I love the look of this bag...I read all the reviews before purchase and even pulled out my ruler to make sure it was the size I needed it to be. It arrived today, much to my disappointment because the measurements given for the product description are not correct. I ordered a couple Fit & Fresh containers and I can't even put one of them in this bag and close the zipper. :( Sad to see this adorable bag get shipped back"
5,Best lunch bag ever!!!!!,"I love my stylish lunch bag, even my husband mistakes it for my purse! It is a great size to fit all your needs! I use it withIcy Cools Reusable Ice Cubesand my food stays cold ALL day long. There's never any leaks! I recommend this to everyone!"
4,"Nice Bible, really small...",Cute Bible but a little on the small side with very small print. The price was great at $5.00.
1,Shallow waters,A great idea: to base a project around a liquid water theme in an ambient genre. I didn't know what to expect but I expected more than this. Uninspired hollow mechanical flowing & dripping hydro-sounds with sophomoric reprocessed background electronica leave you thirsty for more. Theres too much here for an ambient minimalist work and not enough of anything to keep this project afloat. There was great potential in this CD. Unfortunately it is devoid of any character.
5,Great Video!,"If I could give this 6 stars I would. I loved this video and Buck does a wonderful job of capturing the wildlife, scenery and the power of Alaska all by himself in this solo adventure. He has a great way of allowing you to share the experience and you feel like you are there. This video inspired a trip of my own that I will never forget. Thanks Buck and keep them coming!"
2,A little less than was expected,"This is not bad for an amateur type video. I had expected a more professional production to be on sale at Amazon, well I guess I learnt something too. One cannot take away from the fact that the hunting trip recorded is a remarkeable achievement and I am envious particularly since I live in the southern hemisphere and a long way from Alaska. A great story but the production quality is not up to the same standard."
5,Great Alaska hunting video,"This is a great video by 1 guy who made the 6 week trip by raft & on foot hunting in Alaska for moose, caribou & dall sheep.The scenery is beautiful & it's like your there with him.I highly recommend this video, well worth the money!!!Amazing 1 guy did this video alone where other videos take 2 or even 3 people to do.Great video!!!!!!!!"
5,Just What I Needed!!,"I said a prayer two days ago, and asked for a book that explained anatomy in simple terms that I understand, and then, I walked into the college bookstore and saw this. First of all, ANYTHING by Mosby would be purchased by me, and this is no exception! Now, this is a small, compact book that you can carry anywhere, to the supermarket, on the train, even to class rather than the large textbooks that are also needed. While much more of the information may be in the text, this is a great supplement, because anything that you need to add, there is room on many of the pages to include your own notes. Now, I know I will make it through Anatomy, as well as on my way to become a nurse! GET THIS BOOK!!"
1,Beware the desciption is worng,I ordered this and was thrilled by the great price... What I got was a towel in the mail. It appears Mr. Thirs is shorty for Thirsty; which appears to be some wonder towel that absords more water then a regular towel... NOTDo not order this!!!!!!!!!
3,Good idea badly executed,"The narrative of this book is all over the place. Marine salvage, breaking codes, Japanese military attaches in Nazi Germany, submarines carrying vital strategic cargo, but the book has a very disjointed feel. The author can't put all of these topics together in a coherent story. The book is supposed to be how sinking 1 particular Japanese submarine kept the Japanese from building a dirty bomb, but in the first 125 pages, I couldn't even find that phrase mentioned.I think the editor is more to blame here than the author."
1,quite simply: this book is a mess,"Heresay, legend, rumor, unsubstantiated facts and technical inaccuracies are sloppily interwoven around the story of an expedition to find a Japanese submarine with two tons of gold aboard that was sunk in the Atlantic during World War Two.Was part of the submarine's mission to exchange the gold for nuclear material that could be used to produce 'dirty' bomb? Was the surrender and capture - at the war's end - of the U-234 another attempt to do just that?It's hard to say and the author provides absolutely no documentation to support a word of his theory. It makes books like 'The Brotherhood of the Bell,' 'The Hunt for Zero Point' and 'Japan's Secret War: Japan's Race Against Time to Build Its Own Atomic Bomb' read like scholarly tomes."
3,Meh...,"This boxed set contains restored versions of Early Hitchcock Films back when he was in Britain, Good Set, Great Video Transfers..But i do have a question? If you are going to restore classic public domain Hitchcock movies why did you choose these? The 4 movies i would have picked are The Lady Vanishes, The 39 Steps, The Man Who Knew Too Much and The Secret Agent...Not these movies"
4,Layered minimal techno,keeps you following the sounds right till the end..If you like this try Squarepusher's - Feed Me Weird Things.
4,Get a Kick out of it!,"Malia has a wonderful style. It's jazz and soul. Her voice is rich and uplifting. The music will you a boost if you are stuck sitting in traffic. Heads up to the guys: the songs are geared towards woman listeners, about girls' power. Tracks like ""I believes in Roses"" and ""purple Shoes"" will just stick in your head. I bought the CD in NOV02 in Paris, and I am hooked to it."
1,You've GOT to be joking!,"I don't know what planet the other reviewers are on, but this jont SUCKS. This CD is the kind that's playing in a shop when you walk in and it's so damn bad that you leave quickly without buying anything.Don't waste your money -- this ish is A-W-F-U-L..."
2,Beware of EXTRA Sauce,"I tried ordering the original version of this cd, The Sauce, three different times...each time I received EXTRA Sauce, which is the version with Mickey Raphael's over-the-top harmonica tracks laid in all over every song. Mickey may be a good player, but Eddie's original Sauce release stands tall (and much better) all on its own, sans the cheesy harmonica. The pic of the cd cover says The Sauce, but beware that you'll probably receive Extra Sauce if you order this product. The good news is that Amazon makes returns easy!"
3,worth it for KILLER WEED,"The rest of it I could take or leave.If you like Killer Weeed, check out Mighty High...In Drug City."
5,there is no guitar but the romantique guitar,"hey its me kurt from seattle again.... yeah i love the romantic guitar and i also loved this cd. hmm loved is an understatement. Juan Parga was eclipsed by the great Tarrega but his music shows that his unpopular name should become known. Juan parga is a brillante composer and this cd should prove that fact. Jose Broca has always been a favorite composer of mine and his recuerdo triste or ""sad memory"" is recorded with all the emotion and love that is possible for romantic music to be sounded out of a wooden box with strings. Basicaly like always if you like romantic music and you like romantic music on guitar then this cd is waiting for you BUY IT! Let the romantic guitar music culture prosper and grow forevermore...."
5,"Weird, but wow!","I bought this album off a recommendation from Gibraltar (http://www.gepr.net/geprfram.htm), where you should go for an informed review. After my first trip through it, I have to say I agree with they wrote. This is a mixture of the prog rock / metal that I love in Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, and Symphony X, along with jazz and what sounds like gyspy music. Gibraltar says they at times sound like Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, and Frank Zappa. I was also reminded of Traffic's Mr. Fantasy album."
3,No Character Growth,"As usual with Georgette Heyer, the representation of the period (first world war) is very well done, though what is represented is only a small section of society. Supplementary characters are sufficiently realistic.The main disappointment is in the lack of growth of the heroine - Helen. She starts out as extremely devoted to her father (and protected by him). Goes through a phase of meaningless experimentation - going to wild parties, falling in love with artists etc - all essentially meaningless, because she doesn't learn or grow (she is opposed to self-analysis). Even her war work as a nurse doesn't make an impact.Once her father dies, she falls into the arms of her patient suitor. Basically the umbilical cord is transferred, and one can imagine Helen transferring it to her son if her husband were to die (say, in the second world war), and her grand son (grand daughter won't do!, it has to be a male)."
4,Intimacy,"Buckner shares a space in my racks with Will Oldham(Bonny Prince Billy)as a premier poet of the darker recesses of the heart; a 2am poet of, in his own words,'devotion and doubt' with a decided leaning to the latter. While there are variations in his expression and the weight of his delivery, the focus is insistent. This eponymous collection is close-up, stripped and raw. For the Buckner fan, it's a valuable addition. I don't rate it as highly as the rockier, Bloomed. And none of his work ranks as highly as, The Hill, which I reckon to be a masterwork, a twenty-first century classic in the realm of Van Morrison's, 'Astral Weeks', or The Blue Nile's, 'Walk Across The Rooftops'."
5,Hands down the best shark book,"This by far is the best book on sharks that I have seen. The detail spent organizing the species and the layout of the species desription and photo is excellent.I run a marine biology website and this is the most popular book sold on the site. When people e-mail me with book suggestions this one is always on the top of my list. I have yet to hear any negative responses.Of all the shark books I have seen, not only is this the most organized, but it is also the most complete. No other book gives as many descriptions of the various shark species as this book.This book is great fro kids and adults. I think it should be in every families library."
2,They actually break very easily,"I love the shape and clarity of these glasses. However, their claim of being hard to break is greatly exaggerated. Two have already broken - one after falling 4 inches from the dishrack to the counter. My Eisch and Riedel glasses have not suffered the same fate."
5,Especially Useful In Adoration Chapel,"THE AGONY OF JESUS is essentially a meditation on the agony of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane.It was first published in 1952 by Fr. Ezechia Cardone, O.F.M. to encourage increased devotion to Christ.The short booklet begins and ends with a prayer and is divided into four parts accompanied by teachings. It also includes seventeen photographs of Father Pio. I find the booklet to be especially useful in adoration chapel but of course it can be used virtually anywhere at anytime."
5,Review from the Publisher,THE AGONY OF JESUS. Padre Pio. remarkable meditations on the Agony of Jesus in the Garden. One of Padre Pio's few writings. 40pp. PB. 17 Illus. Imprimatur.
4,"Good Columbo, but research was poor.","Have enjoyed all of the Harrington Columbo's. Great for plane trips or even motel nights while on a Road Trip. This one pleased as always, but I found the shoddy research bothersome. No one in Southern California heats their home with oil and to find a block of up-scale private homes on West Santa Monica Boulevard (let alone be able to close the street because of a bomb) is really a stretch. Outside of that enjoyed the book and the references to previous Columbo books. Hope the series continues (with tighter research)."
1,Trash talk,"This is the first Columbo/Harrington novel I have read - and the last. The writing reads like a script with little characterization (the reader needs to rely on previous knowledge of the television Columbo) or development. The sparse plot is a vicious rehash of nasty rumors about J. Edgar Hoover and Michael Jackson. All in all, I felt as if I needed to wash my hands after reading this book."
3,Good for basic reference.,"This book does actually cover several different topics concerning the AK-47/AKM, but it doesn't cover any of them too deeply. The colored pictures don't really have a quality beyond ""neat"" and the book has a more than usual share of spelling/punctuation errors.If you're looking for just a cursory overview of AK-47/AKM history, application, and modification, this book is more or less satisfactory, but those looking for more depth are going to be wishing this book had more meat to it."
2,"Very basic historic reference work, not much more","I bought this book expecting to learn more details on the design and development of this rifle and to have a reference work to show some examples of this design. OK, it fills that bill for the average enthusiast.But I found the slightly politicized content, the less than acceptable technical descriptions, and a few mistakes (I count no less than six reversed photographs!) to make the overall book a below par experience.A technical book like this should have had a competent technical editor. I see no evidence of this."
4,college degrees by mail and internet,"I purchased this book along with another by the same author. The thing that I liked about this book was that it was to the point and laid out in an easy to use format. It also only listed accredited schools, which is helpful for those interested in a degree that has true value once earned. My only criticism is in regards to how he explained pricing. Average to one person may be out of reach to another. Some actual dollar ranges would be helpful. Good info about clep tests and the like."
1,Inaccurate & Incomplete,I was searching for Bachelors in Accounting degrees ---I already knew of several Internet Schools offering them. The book listed 2 out of the 15 I knew of and didn't mention they offered that degree. All I can say is if it was my only source I'd be majorly SOL.
2,Not worth buying,"With so many more up-to-date CDs on the Bible, the Book of Mormon and the Koran, this CD is not worth the investment today, unless searching key words is important to you. There are numerous websites that offer free access to the three books."
1,Merchant shipped the wrong product,The merchant shipped a completely different piece of software do not buy this product. I was very dissappointed.
3,Good Information but a hard read,"I really enjoyed this book. It was full of excellent information and helped with my new product launch strategies.If you are involved in new product launch and are a small business owner. This book is for you. It will help you to learn exactly how to launch your products like the huge corporations out there.However, it would've livened up the book a bit more if they had included more case studies."
2,Not for serious marketers - perhaps amateurs will find useful,The book is not written on a sophisticated level. It seems to be directed at elementary school or high school students more than serious business professionals. Very little of the material is backed up by research or studies and many of the logical arguments presented are inherently flawed.I do not recommend this book.
2,This management book is not universal!,I am very disappointed by this book. I think he only applies in the US. No successful example is done outside the US. I suggest to the author to have a more broaden approach of branding and product launch.
3,Product of its time - low budget B movies,"I didn't realize how bad talentless some acts and movies were but I guess everyone had to start somewhere. Step and fetchit was the old ""dumb"" stereo type no one would stand for today, thank goodness."
4,more wonderful Phil Coulter,I was introduced to Phil Coulter via James Galway. Now I own several of his CD's. This one is a duplicate I will someday give it as a trade to a good friend who also loves Celtic musicMust recomend this to any Coulter fan or to anyone who wants to listen to very good Celtic music.
5,Great system for the moneys,Skylink SC-100 Security System was very easy to install. Took less than 2 hours; would have taken less if I was more competent in handling tools. No problems with linking the sensors to the main unit.Only problem was that the 9 volt batteries for the motion detector and backup to the main unit were just about dead. Emailed the supplier who promptly provided me with a refund to purchase new batteries.System has been installed for about a month with no problems - keeping my fingers crossed. A system like this may put regular alarm installers out of business.
2,Interferes with your wifi,I purchased this however will never use it. I went through the installation and set up everything to find my apple tv and airport express units could no longer operate at a usable level. Even my laptop had very little reception to my router and everything I tried looking at timed out. I instantly removed the batteries from the alarm system and all my wifi problems disappeared. Can't say for sure that this will be everyone's experience however it was a deal breaker for me.
1,Inexpensive for a reason,"I purchased one of these systems for a metal building in rural central Texas. It was easy to set up, easy to arm and use. Problems with the system are these: the siren is not loud, the siren and chime failed completely within six months and support is non-existent from the Skylink staff. This may be a good alarm for a climate controlled dorm room, but I would suggest a more robust system."
1,sucks,This was not worth my buy at all It was very cheap looking and the function was horrible. It halfway worked
1,"Bad product, don't waste your money",Device did not work. Instructions not helpful when there is an problem. Motion sensors would no program correctly and alarm would not activate. It was a waste of time and money.
3,Anybody know?,"I've got a question. The door I want to mainly protect has a door jamb so that the magnets don't meet when closed. Also, it's a steel door and I can't drill into it so I can't attach wood piece onto door to even out door with jamb. Anyone else run into this or have any ideas?The first one of these I ordered didn't work and I want to make sure before I have another go. thanks."
4,"Great product, little bit pricey though","Great product, but I think the price shouyld be at least 25% less. Serves the purpose. It has been working flawlessly for about a month now. The documentation should be improved."
1,Poor design and bad customer service,I purchased one of skylink's products in December 2009. Bad design and Customer Service and repair facility was a real nightmare. Unless you want a HUGE LONGTERM headache avoid this company.
2,How do I reset the PIN?????,"Does anyone know how to reset the PIN on this thing?I just bought it and the service is TERRIBLE. I am a computer engineer and so I am not an idiot, but there is NO instruction provided how to reset the PIN if you forget it. This product is USELESS without the info!"
2,not fuction,I bought the sc100 security system. I live in Honduras Central America. I bought the sistem via Gbox. I install the system an the accesories very easy but the contral panel dos not recive electricity from the ac 120 volts. I think the control panel is wrong. I need help so i can install the control panel with electricity
2,alarm,I'M KIND OF DESAPINTED AFTER TESTED THE SISTEM . EVEN A SMALL BUSINESS NEIHBORH COULD NOT HERA IT. WHICH IS BESIDE ME THAT TELL ME THIS ALARM IS NOT A REALLY GOOD SECURITY SYSTEM. NEEDA LOUD SIREN .TO WORK PROPERLY.
1,So few sensors for up to 3000 sq foot house?,"I'm sharing my humble, though thought out and experienced logic here:My yellow flags are out here, as we think there's price gouging here.Though we don't own one of these kits, we don't think we want to-because of the sooo few sensors that come with the kit that theysay is for a 3000 sq ft home.We have a 2300 sq ft, 4 Bedroom house:but we have 3 doors, and 10 windows to protect! And protecting thishouse would cost another $100 dollars, or more, to buy extra sensors.And, furthermore, the poor batteries life would be an expense thatwould eventually prompt us to turn the whole system off.Why aren't AA alkaline batteries used here? You can buy 40 atSams/Costco for $10 or so and they will last years!Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this a very poor choice?Thanks.Don"
4,Excellent Solution,"Finally I can be away worry free. I have a dog, she barks but it wouldn't take but a minute for an intruder to make a life-long friend with her. Because my job requires late nights three or four nights a week I worry until I get home. Home has some high-end camera gear and musical instruments, not to mention three Macs. One solution would a pro-installed system. But, I live in a rental house so that is not an option. The Skylink SC-100 system, though not the cheapest solution, was the best for my situation. In the end, I purchased one more door/window sensor and some very official looking window decals.7 Home Burglar Alarm Security System Static Cling StickersI deducted one star because this unit does not have a universal alarm output. I really wanted to pair this with a webcam but the lack of output from the SC-100 negated that ability."
4,Works well for the $$$,"The system was very easy to install and works well. I opted to add an additional door sensor, audible alarm, and motion sensor. The accessories all work well with this unit. Remember during installation to program additional door sensors to zones 1 and 2 which operate on delay (45 seconds). Overall pleased with the product."
4,Security Syatem,Set this up in my daughters home. Didn't take long and worked perfectly. She feels much safer at night. Highly recommend.
2,Mostly AutoCad drawings.,"I am an Architectural Engineer and just love to learn more every single day. I just bought this Architectural Elements CD and didn't find the Autocad drawings very much helping me for interior detailing projects.It wourth getting this Architectural item,but I don't belive it wourth its price for now.That's why I only gave it two stars."
4,A University Press book with Heart,"University Press books are most often expensive, somewhat boring, and serve a relatively small audience. Not this one. From the Sin e is not only affordable, it's quite readable too. Wall's work is spare yet clear, and he informs us well, not overbearingly. The book is a bit of a conundrum - part remembrance, part criticism, part travelogue, part creative exposition, yet all of it quite interesting. Wall understands the psyche of the nascent ""Irish-American"" identity. It's made to be read in pieces, which some might consider a flaw, as there's no real cohesion to the parts."
2,"Swoosh, Stick, Swoosh, Stick",I purchased this as a Christmas present for my son and his wife. The sun is out and we broke it open this weekend for a family gathering. Easy to set up. Rackets in hand. Ready... play. Swoosh. Stick. Swoosh Stick. The birdie stuck in the racket nearly every other strike. Very frustrating. A fluid game would be impossible. Now I'll have to buy a set of nicer rackets (tighter strings) to go with the net and birdie.
5,PSP G-Pak Organizer,"This is a must have in travel case for the psp system, I bought this cause i travel alot by train and i can carry 22 umd's, psp charger, usb cable, head phones, extra battery, game manuals, and other psp accessories that you mite need while traveling. It has a strong shoulder strap and you can divide the inside up to make your own areas for your psp and accessories. It also so has a outside zipper pocket to store anything else you mite need to carry with you. This is one of the best case out there for your psp system, carry every thing you need with no problems."
5,Excelente bolso PS2,"El bolso es excelente, posee sistema de ventilacion para no tener que sacar la consola del bolso, ya que el mismo permite conectarlo al tv sin tener que sacar la consola del mismo bolso. Muy comodo para cargarlo en la mano o el hombro."
2,I was disappointed in this one,"My expectations were set by the price, and I expected more insights and/or a book I could enjoy reading and displaying, since we adopted our son from Guatemala. The book is written extremely simplistically, to the point that it can be painful to read for anyone with a reading level over fifth grade or so. The photographs are okay, but there is nothing particularly unusual or enlightening about them, and one could find basically the same kind of thing in travel brochures. Overall, it's just way too expensive for what it is."
2,Prince Harry,"This book though interesting in some ways, it was very poorly written. There were numerous errors in typing and factual dates were inaccurate. The author used quotes from other books on the royal family, so a lot of the information was second hand and already covered in other books on the subject. As a first book on the prince in paperback it is ok, but I am sure there will be other books to follow that will be much better quality."
2,Good workout.,"I got this DVD yesterday, and watched it immediatly. Disk wasn't snaped on steady in a box, so it was shifting around during the transportation and got scratched. Also none of my two DVD players and two computers could play performance part of a program. But workout part was nice and pleasant to dance.Tanna Valentine are so good instructor and exellent dancer. If you will get a nondefective copy of this disk you will love it totally."
5,Goddess Kali,"I am a beginner bellydancer, I found the basic movement breakdown very clear, she explained and demonstrated everything very clearly. The beginners 10 minute practise is really good I could follow it really easily. I spent 20 minutes plus the 10 minute practise for 3 days in a row then I went on to the 30 minute workout. I found it easy to follow, her instructions are really good, very clear and I'm not able to do all the moves that well yet but that's good because I won't get bored and I'll be able to work on my technique until I can do the practises with good form. The performances of Tanna were lovely, she is a really good dancer and has really polished technique, Giselle did a tribal performance, which was ok and she did a regular bellydance cabaret type performance that was quite good, Yoshina did a couple of performances but there didn't seem to be much bellydance moves in there it was more theatrical."
5,Fun and functional!,An entertaining tome essential for anyone with even the slightest bit of linguistic curiosity. Useful as a source for those high scoring Scrabble words! This book is full of suprises!
5,Another great undergraduate book,"Hallo and Simpson provide another choice to instructors of ancient Near Eastern history. Well researched, supported, and clearly written, it can easily serve as the only text for an introductory class. Non-specialists and laypeople may wish to consult it for basic facts."
1,Truly Wretched,"Even if you enjoyed watching paint dry, this movie would still bore you to death. This is easily one of the slowest, dullest, visually uninteresting titles in the recent wave of euro-horror releases on DVD and VHS. It's anemic to the 100th degree. Except for a few severed heads and a dollop of nudity, there is absolutely nothing here to recommend. There's also no bloodsucker and no dance. Don't waste your time - life is short!"
5,Healing for everyone,This collection of music is very healing for anyone who has experienced personal loss or tragedy. What a wonderful tribute.
3,Great If You're Looking For Flag Coverage,"I personally have always been much more interested in Black Flag than in Rollins band, particularly post-1990, so the fact that this book is 70% Flag is just fine with me. I've also read every little thing I could get my hands on about Black Flag since 1985 or so, and I gained plenty of new insights through this book. Parker does overwrite here and there, sounding like a bit of a starstruck fan, but with a book that's mostly about a crazy rock band you shouldn't be expecting Tolstoy. To give this book one star is underrating it without question. Makes a fine companion piece to ""Get In The Van""."
4,LA Hardcore Memories,"This is a very interesting book. It's 3 am, and I just put it down. The author does a good job at describing what it was like back then.A couple of minor corrections: the ""punk crash pad"" that Black Flag stayed at, the TC household, did not stand for ""totally connected"". TC meant ""The Connected"" (that's where ""The Rejected"" of the movie Suburbia came from ). Also, the author makes it sound like there were no girls dancing in the pit. That's not true. There weren't very many, but we were there, and the guys slam dancing around us respected us and protected us."
1,This book should be subtitled: A biography of Black Flag,"I bought this book thinking I would get more insight into Henry Rollins, not just a history of the DC punk scene, followed by a detailed history of Black Flag. There is very little said in this book about Rollins that a fan doesn't already know from attending his spoken word shows. You get about 20-30 pages of the time period covering 1961 to 1980, then ~230 pages covering 1980-1986, with the chapter last of the book glossing over 1986-1998. I felt the book rambled along at times and I was tempted to toss it aside. I thought after reading the other reviews that this book was going to be so much better than it was. The bottom line: I would spend my money on another Rollins spoken word DVD instead of buying this book."
2,turned off!,"This could have been pure class but the book tripped up and fell flat on its face. Basically this is a ask-peole-who-say-they-know-rollins-biography. Seems the people who were asked were from pre-Black Flag days and I would doubt if Rollins associates with them any more. The only cool moments were the drop-rollins-in-it parts about the man rolling around on the floor on glass shards and taking some dodgy chemicals cunningly stored in an eye-drops bottle... A part from that, there are no kicking-ass moments here. Unless you like the tedium of hearing the ins and outs of the long gone DC punk scene don't buy this. Instead, for some night-churning, fist clenching, manic depression, buy Black Coffee Blues (Part one) or Solipsist!"
5,Big Screen Poker - Big Fun,"This game is fun-fun-fun. While I never use the ""Loball"" game (it's too confusing for me), the regular Draw and Deuces games are a lot of fun. Sometimes you get lucky and can build up quite a lot of points. Battery life is super. Just be careful if you have a lot of points and don't play the game for a while... don't put it anywhaere where the ""Player"" or ""Game"" buttons might get accidentally pushed or you'll lose your points. :-/Get this game and have a ball!"
2,"Too easy to win, and it doesn't keep accurate totals","Unit is attractive and well designed mechanically, but the game itself is poorly thought out for one player. It allows you to let a big win ride on the next hand, but if you lose that hand, the game doesn't subtract the loss from your point total. It also awards 100 bonus points after three consecutive wins, which happens more often than you might think; plus, if you win the next hand after that, you get 100 more bonus points, and so on as long as you keep winning. These two factors make it way too easy to rack up points, and that takes most of the fun out of playing."
2,disappointed,The game is boring! No written instructions came with it. Why does it shift and exclude pairs or three of a kind in the totals?
5,"Solid stands, a bit bigger than expected","The speaker platforms are a bit bigger than they seem in the pictures, 8.5 inches on a side according to my ruler. This makes them seem a bit oversized for my case since my speakers are less than 5 inches on a side, but that's not really a flaw in these stands, just a misperception on my part. The height is excellent however, putting the speakers right around my ear level when set on my desk. The stands are fairly plain in appearance, but that works to their advantage I think since they don't stand out visually, especially if your desk and speakers are also black."
3,Buy if you like Crowded House/Neil Finn,"Nicholson's vocal similarity to Neil Finn (both solo and with Crowded House) is uncanny, and the song structures are similar, too. This is a good thing, if you're like me and can't get enough Crowded House/Finn. However, Nicholson's songs aren't quite as interesting---yet. The sound and the hooks are there, but there is a sameness to the songs that he never quite breaks out of. Still, a very listenable and enjoyable record, which bodes well for his next release."
4,nice lamp,"The lamp seems to be well made and heavy-duty (time will tell how well made). It was shipped in its display box, but wasn't damaged. There was no warranty card. The odd thing is that you have to operate two switches to turn on the fluorescent light: A red rocker on-off switch, then a black rocker switch to turn on the lamp. There is a third rocker switch for the regular bulb. The fluorescent bulb light output is very blue."
2,"Week, bulky, lame","The lamp is dumpy. The power block at the bottom is bulky, ugly and pretty much useless. The support arms will not keep the head in a selected position. I returned the lamp in favor of the Alvin lamp."
5,The perfect desk light,I was a little shaken by the look of the packaging of this light but it has turned out to be exactly what I have wanted for years. The swing/extendable arm is longer than most and the light has both floresent (to add a lot of light) and incondesent (for just the right amount of light) bulbs that can be used seperatly or at the same time. It is very sturdy and works great. I would buy it again.
3,Great light configuration - Lousy switches,"I bought mine a couple months ago to use on my workbench in my windowless garage. At the time, it was the only articulated lamp I could find with both fluorescent and incandescent bulbs with high intensity.The good:- The light quality and intensity is just what I needed.- The outlet in the base is very handy feature.- I like the handle on the lamp head.- The clamp to attach the lamp to the bench seems solid.The bad:- The two switches on the lamp head are garbage. Most of the time I have to fiddle with them to get the lights to turn on.- The arm doesn't support the lamp head well enough. It sags in some positions.The crappy switches are irritating but I decided to keep it anyway because it was the only lamp I could find a the time that had the right design to meet my needs."
3,crappy quality control,"I opened up the the box and low and behold one of the the plastic pieces that holds in the circle lamp was broken. what crappy quality control from Ledu. The lamp sticks out from the shade housing, how much trouble do you think its going to be to return the thing especially since I've got too much work to do and really need this lamp.Shame on Ledu for this, I guess pride of workmanship doesn't mean anything."
2,BAD ON /OFF SWITCH,"The on off rocker switch stop working the first day, this lamp (ledu L445WT) shouldhave a more reliable on/off switch.Very disappointed with this item."
1,Junk! Arrived Broken. Lamp Clips Are Plastic Junk. Center Bulb was Broken. Worth about $10,This is not the product shown in the photos.It is junk.The circline bulb is held in by plastic clips.All three clips were broken.The center bulb can use an incandescent or compact fluorescent bulb.They provided a compact fluorescent.The compact fluorescent was broken in its box.The shipping box is paper-thin.They charged me almost $100 for this product.It could not have cost more the $1.25 to make AND ship from China.I have an original Ledu Tai-Lite from many years ago. It is a great product.This one is junk.Junk. Junk. Junk.I bought a replacement identical lamp from Staples.It too is: JUNK. JUNK. JUNK.
4,what i expected,though its kind of expensive. i did want to get a cheap light for my kids for doing homework. i am happy with this product.
1,Worthless Piece of Crap,"This lamp was purchased from Amazonto replace a three-year old earlier model which was damaged during a move. It worked perfectly until the movers ruined it.The replacement became unusable after the first 2 hours of use. The swing arm mounted to the base can not hold any position past vertical. The lamp head ends up 3 inches above my work surface when the base arm is extended. Tightening the nuts on the pivot shaft has no effect.For shame, Ledu and Amazon!!"
3,one big lamp,"The lamp is great, the light it gives off is great, but the lamp is HUGE. I bought it for my childrens nightstands as a reading lamp, it looks huge. The mechanism to suspend lamp to table is also not padded, so scratching of furniture will occur."
3,Good product - but beware of seller Shoplet.com,"I just received the product today and was very disappointed: the clamp for mounting the lamp was missing as was any instructions/manual and no 100 Watt bulb. The packing by shoplet.com was absolutely unreal: they simply placed a UPS sticker on the outside of the retail box designed to be put on a shelf. Needless to say the trip via UPS obliterated the box and I suspect that is how the clamp and instructions were lost.Normally the shipper's place the product in a larger box with some bubble wrap.Now the real kicker: I got a bag of candy from shoplet the day after I ordered - packed in a really nice strong box! Somebody has their priorities wrong over there - they should spend the money on a decent box instead of overnighting a bag of candies that went in the trash.Bottom line - good light - seems strong and well made, but beware of the seller - shoplet.com could become shopnot.com."
2,"great lamp, but shipment is incomplete","This is a great lamp, especially for color work. With both types of light, it makes a real difference in how color appears on paper.However, as with another reviewer, my lamp arrived with no clamp, no instructions, and no light bulb. How am I supposed to use it if there's no way to attach it to a desk?Nice, now I have to go out shopping and find a clamp, which is exactly what I wanted to avoid by buying online."
5,Extremely satisfied,"I needed a desk lamp to use with my computer since the one I was using was 15 years old and sometimes went out before I turned it off. The Ledu L445Bk clamp on lamp more than adequately satisfied my needs. It has two light sources -- a ring lamp and a 100 watt energy-saving bulb, either of which provides adequate lighting."
4,Couldn't put this one down!,"I read this book in two nights. I just couldn't put it down! Never a dull moment, never a part that drags. A truly suspenseful fictional triller. While the book has little to do with the actual book of Revelations, it was still a captivating read with underlying themes of good vs. evil, priveleged vs. underpriveleged, and the inner moral and emotional struggles within all of us. I can't believe I didn't pick this book up sooner, and look forward to reading the rest in the series."
3,Not bad.. not great,"Katherine Thorn, the wife of Robert Thorn an ambassador to the US, gives birth to a child that dies. Without her knowledge, a priest recommends to Robert that he substitute another baby as theirs. A few years go by and grisly deaths begin to happen. The child's nanny hangs herself and a priest is speared to death in a freak accident. It turns out the child is the son of Satan and can only be killed with the seven daggers of Meggado.I can't say that I agree with some of the reviews here. It was an ok book, but nothing overly special. If you've seen the movie, then I can't think of a need to read the book. I found them nearly identical."
4,"Exciting,Chilling,Scary and very well written",The book is extremely well written and you are always on the edge wondering what's going to happen next.It never gets boring and keeps you engrossed all through even getting scary at times.Readers with higher imaginative quotient might really feel frightened at times so the book delivers a lot more than it promises.Read it as a book and try not to pick it up if you get frightened easily.
4,sitar yerself down,"Definitely a great addition to a well-rounded collection. Looking for something that will entertain kids and adults at the same time? This will fit the bill; the exception to the light-hearted nature of the album being the last song, a foray into more mature realms of musical psychic exploration that is itself worth the cost of the album."
3,OK - If you're a fan who wants everything by JD,"If you are looking for ""live"" John Denver, this is alright. Nothing to write home about. You'd be better off sticking to the re release of ""An Evening With"" or ""The Wildlife Concert"" or even ""Greatest Hits Live."" This is good, but I've heard better..all of the songs with a few exceptions have been released live one way or another. As good as this could have been, it feels like a soundboard mixing tape that was put to CD to take advantage of sales. You want a great ""new"" live recording, get his new Christmas Concert CD. Again, this one's OK, not great."
5,Great,"John Denver's last concert in Australia is a must for all JD fans. It is John at his best, relating to his audience as only he could do."
5,Musto is the man,"This book is incredible. Musto is the man. I would know. He's my professor. The book is incredibly interesting, especially if you are unfamiliar with the history of drugs, and it is absolutely packed with info. I can't say enough about how insanely intelligent this man is and that he is by far the top expert in the field."
2,Lose your Love Handles,"Mr. Shilstone became famous for training atheletes and in particular helping them GAIN weight. While the diet and exercise portions of the book are very sensible and there is a lot of good information on heart disease, this book will not help you lose body fat in any reasonable amount of time. One of his ""sucess"" stories has a man losing 5lbs and 3% body fat in four months! He should hit the healthy range in about 5 years. The lack of resistance training is the main weakness. I suggest ""The Nautalis Diet"" or ""Fit or Fat"" if you are serious about your health and weight."
5,INCA SON APPLIES ITS POWERS TO FAMILIAR USA MELODIES,"you might be interested in these arrangements of ENglish melodies, and then pursue their more traditional Andes tunes on other recordings if still available. Inca Son for long was the most effective and professional group of Andean born musicians based in Boston. May they long play. See their website. These common English melodies could wear thin with repeated playing if not for the energy and feeling of the performers so please see their more traditional and original music."
4,Small Fits Oakley Whiskers,"There is debate in the reviews over the size of the case. The Small Soft Vault is small and oddly shaped compared to a typical pair of glasses. This would be a poor bet if you're uncertain whether your frames will fit. However, the Oakley website specifically lists the Oakley models which fit this case.Oakley Whiskers are a snug, but perfectly comfortable, fit. Since I have no trouble getting my sunglasses in or out and closing the zipper, this ultimately means that the case takes up no more space in my bag than it absolutely needs to.The quality is perfectly fair. I wouldn't drive a car over it, but I wouldn't worry at all about dropping it or sitting on it, either. For twenty dollars, it doesn't have to last a lifetime - just long enough to save your expensive sunglasses from a few scrapes and knocks."
2,Child's case?,"This case is so very small, it must be meant for children's sunglasses. None of my normal sized and smaller shades would fit into it. Returning this"
3,Smaller than expected.,"I was a bit hesitant on buying this since it has no sizing info. So I went straight to Oakley's website and it says there that the small vault could fit mostly for whisker, fives, fives squared, etc. So I went on to buying it. When I received it the shipping was fast and it came a day ahead (and I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 because of that) BUT, the thing is, it's really small. I don't think it would fit the fives or whisker's. I own a squared whisker and it does fit in but it fits really tight to the point that I'm concerned that the sunglasses might get bent or out of shape in time. I think this small vault would best fit their small prescription glasses instead of what has been said. Food for thought."
3,Just a hair too small for my Oakley Tightrope's,"The case itself is pretty good. Nice and compact. Sturdy enough to protect the glasses from most hazards. It wouldn't stand up to being run over by a car, but bumps, drops, scrapes, and the like won't be a problem. Great for tossing in a bag or something.However, I purchased this case for my Oakley Tightrope sunglasses, but it is too small (just barely). I can't close the zipper all the way. The Oakley website claims this case will fit the Tightrope, but I don't see how without bending the glasses, or mutilating the case. If it was about 1/4 inch wider, everything would be great.I still use the case, but the zipper doesn't completely close, and a small portion of the hinge on the glasses sticks out the side. This works okay with the way I use the case, but I was disappointed. If you have a pair of sunglasses that does fit inside, then this case will be great. It is light and compact while still strong enough to withstand most potential damage."
5,Cowboy Boots,"My niece loves her little red cowboy boots, she won't take them off. This was a perfect gift for her and I love that it was available through Amazon. Thanks"
4,Good product,I bought it has a gift for my brother. It works nice and for the price it worked real nice.
2,No power what so ever,"I was using it for my barbeque sauce, it had no power and after about two minutes it started to get very hot."
4,"Complete set for a vacation home, good value","The set is very handy. Plus: the three attachments are easy to handle and work very well.Minus: the shape of the beeker that comes with the set is larger on the top, doesn't make a difference if you are chopping, but don't try to whip something in it - splatters all around!There are two motor speeds, both not super-fast, but this is perfectly sufficient for the set.I would buy it again"
5,"Works well, very pleased","I've been wanting a stick blender for sometime and held off until I could do enough research to make my purchase worthwhile. I've been pleased with its ability to blend soups, sauces and chop. I don't really use the 'high' setting and I'm careful to not run it too long, lest the motor go ka-blooey.I haven't used the whisk attachment yet. But the chopping chamber works well. I wish the tumbler was metal instead of plastic, because the size of it fits perfectly but it's already showing signs of use.I'd definitely recommend this to someone who was interested (especially if you can lock in a decent price)!"
5,Absolutely amazing!,"Love, love, love! While this appliance is not made to mix really thick batters or large quantities, it does absolutely perfectly with everything else! I've been using it practically every other day and it's great"
1,Piece of trash in a slick case,"I always think the bad reviews I read won't happen to me. Don't make that mistake on this one. I used this only a handful of times on broccoli soup - nice and tender cooked with plenty of fluid - and the plastic gear was ""cooked."" Stripped nicely round. Impossible to replace. Really made me mad. Cuisinart is usually a good name, but definitely don't buy the name for this."
2,Wears too quickly,"Bought from SAMS Club in Nov. 2011 . Model HB-154RSAUsed rarely.Lasted until August 2012 when the motor shaft became so stripped that it no longer engaged the blender spoke and so only spun around loosly. Very disappointing. I only used this to mix smoothies, sometimes with frz. fruit.My husband put in a flat piece of metal to make it tighter and it worked for one try. I cannot find this plastic motor part anywhere online. At 200 Watts this is not a good buy unless you do not want to use it.I had the exact same problem with my CSB9 Cuisinart Blender parts which at least I could find replacements online to refurbish it.I bought a Vitamix blender instead from ebay, (heaven :) and will probably go with an all metal parts hand blender as well. Not worth the frustration."
1,Don't Buy This Product!,"I have bought two of these within the last six months....only because I assumed when the first one broke, it was a fluke. No, the second one only lasted 2 and a half months. There was absolutely no stress and misuse....just one cup of hot chocolate in the morning. I am so disappointed and angry....particularly because I am still using my original Cuisinart from the late 70's. I guess, I'll try another brand."
1,Nice appliance ruined by the accounting department,This thing would be great except it's clear the accounting department got themselves involved and demanded a cheap cheap cheap plastic gear instead of just a cheap cheap metal gear. The teeth stripped right off about the 2nd time I used it and the thing is totally useless. No response from Cuisinart customer service.
5,hand blender,"This metal is very solid, and a bit heavy-which is good. The previous hand blender I had was plastic and felt weak."
1,Really bad product,"After 6 months of limited use the product broke. Teeth would not disengage, and the motor stopped. Cuisinart refused to fix because I didn""t have receipt or box to show when/where purchased. I will never buy another Cuisinart product. Wish I could have given 0 stars!!!"
5,Wonderful!,I purchased this because I had a Kitchenaid mini-prep and Kitchenaid Stick Blender and had minimum space. I replaced two appliances with one. There isn't a meal I prepare that I don't reach for this and absolutely love it. Have never had any problems with the ease of disengaging the attachments from the handle. I really like the way the chopping bowl does not have a hole in the bottom.
2,Don't expect a long life from this gadget,"It's a beautifully powerful piece of equipment, but my love for it burned hard and fast after it crapped out after a only year of light use. Fell victim to the same stripped gears that other reviewers complained about. It's a design flaw plain and simple, if you're looking to buy, it *will* be broken in a matter of time. Look out for telltale melting plastic smell and overheating motor. Frankly I'm surprised it didn't start smoking! Lamesauce. I'm done with Cusinart, will be purchasing a Kitchenaid replacement."
3,Goodbye little chopper attachment.,I have had this little thing for about three years. The immersion blender is the best except for the time I was cleaning out the blades with my thumb and pressed the on button by accident. Surprise! The attachments have worked great until yesterday the little plastic teeth that turn the chopper blades have broken...But overall I think its a good product and a real space saver.
5,I Love it,"I use this all the time making drinks and pancakes mix, I found other way to use it, the chopper is a real saver of time."
3,"OK, but whisk fell apart during use",I like having a hand whisk / blender and tend to use them a lot. Apparently they used to be made better though: my original lasted many years before finally retiring. I bought & returned another popular brand & after reading the reviews got this one. It was worked wonderfully until a few months in - then the wires of the whisk came apart while whisking up some icing (not excessivly thick). This is very dangerous & I'm glad I was using it and not my kids. I hope this was a one off case - I haven't read any other reviews of this happening.
2,motor died,"I bought mine a little over 3 months ago and while it worked it was beautiful I was concerned about the plastic gearing at first and feared it woould strip out and the lil plastic shaving bits had me a touch worried but it worked just fine UNTIL I was crushing ice and the motor died and will not re start, yeah funsies. so now I have al these lovely attachments to take up space and no dirve to work them withThanks CuisinartI doubt I will purchase much from you in future"
2,just ok,"Just moved from Europe, so with the change of voltages, plugs I didn't move any of my appliances. I was trying to get something similar to the Braun I had. This looked like a nice design and similar to what I had so I went for it. I'm a little disappointed for 2 reasons. 1) It gets really hot very quickly. It's obviously not as potent as my old one. Very small jobs only. 2) The cup that goes with the blender is quite shallow. I have to be super careful when mixing my morning smoothie, because it can easily overfow.Overall, not bad, but not great."
1,Was sent wrong item,I was not sent correct item. Very disappointed. It was supposed to be from a kitchen store and I got a hair dryer caddy??
3,"blender good, attachments stink -- keep your receipt!","I used this blender many times to make soups and smoothies, and it totally worked fine -- was easy to clean and blended what I wanted. Unfortunately I waited a year to use any of the attachments and I found out the chopper attachment didn't work the FIRST TIME I tried it. Sooo disappointed. When I called about the limited 3 yr warranty, they said I had to have my receipt (which I threw out after I registered the product last year). I told them I registered the product, and apparently they don't use the product registration database anymore (and the woman couldn't tell me why they have a product registry system). So now I have to pay $15 (and S&H) to replace a plastic attachment when the whole thing cost $35. Lesson here is keep your receipt since the plastic attachments will likely break down on you in 3 yrs, and you can replace it under the warranty."
2,Weak compared to my 10 year old Cuisinart,"I decided to upgrade to the cordless Immersion blender with whisk attachment and chopper from my 10 year old Cuisinart blender with cord. Unfortunately, this was not an upgrade and more unfortunately, I gave my old Immersion blender away so now I am stuck with a weak sleek version. The handheld blender cannot make smoothies like my old one did and just chops the fruits and veggies instead of pureeing them. I can hear the motor struggling to do what my old version just did with ease. It is nice to have the whisk attachment but I really just wish I had my old handheld blender and bought a separate whisk which would have been much cheaper. If you are buying this product to only make pureed soups where the vegetables have been boiled soft, then this can handle the job, but I expected it to perform just as well or better than their past products..."
2,Stuck with a Smart Stick,My Smart Stick worked beautifully until I was using it to make pea soup and a small piece of ham bone came in contact with the blade. The result? A broken unit that cannot be repaired.
2,"Works great as an immersion blender, but not much else.","I wanted an immersion blender and had hoped that this would also replace my handmixer that died. I feel like it is advertised as something that works great for a variety of tasks. This is not that product. It works pretty good as an immersion blender, but does get hot after a bit of use. The whisk attachment is extremely flimsy and is only good for light blending, nothing thick like cookie dough. The mini food processor is nice but got a small crack in the bottom after only a few times of using it. For this price, I would just get a nice immersion blender and a separate hand mixer."
2,Broken !,"I purchsed this blender for my mother for christmas, we used the blender a good 15-20 times before the actual attachment piece broke. The metal and plastic part that meets right at the very top of the attachment piece broke on one side and we had to duct tape it together for the blender to work, otherwise the blender would hang to one side and was not stable. It was a great idea- but too cheap in production in my opinion !"
2,Won't hold up for baby food.,"Received this as a wedding gift and at first, only used it occasionally. For the times we did use it, it was great and worked well. When we had our first baby, I used this (as well as a regular blender) to make all baby food. After about 3 months of use for pureeing baby food, the gears stripped, rendering it useless. Of course, it was after the warranty had expired. Overall, I've been a bit disappointed in this brand because out of my three appliances that I have had of this brand, all 3 have died just after the warranty ended and with use that has been just a slightly more than I would call ""occasional."""
4,Cuisinart hand mixer,"I love this mixer. Because of arthritis, this is making mixing much, much easier. Cleanup is quick and doesn't take up alot of space."
1,Plastic parts inside make it worthless,"I used this blender about 30 times. I used it only to puree cooked veggies for my kid. Nothing hard, no meat. However the teeth inside the handle got stripped off completely. So the motor works, but the bottom does not spin. Now I can not use the whole set, because the main handle is damaged."
4,It's been great so far!,"Haven't used all the parts yet, but so far it works perfectly for what I wanted it for....the immersion blender."
1,Terrible stick blender,"I actually bought this from Sam's Club. The chopper NEVER worked and after one use, the blender didn't work. The top portion sounds like it's working but it doesn't turn the chopper or blender. I tried WD-40 on the blender attachment but it still didn't work. I agree with another reviewer who said it's difficult to separate the top from the attachments. My advice: buy a separate stick blender and chopper. I had a cheapy Sunbeam stick blender for years which worked very well. And I now have a Black & Decker mini-chopper which works great."
5,excellent,"This is an excellent product for the price, don't waste the money on more expense brand names, will buy more."
5,Crossbow Arrows,Unfortunately not able to use the arrows here in our area by my guys. Going to use them for decoration instead of returning them. Nice length and structure.
3,would have been 5 but......,as another guy said mine also didnt have the field tips in the box. there is a hole so you can see the fletchings and i think that there falling out through there barnett needs to put a plastic window or tape the field points to a shaf. that might remedy this problem.
5,Barnett Carbon Crossbow Bolts,The Barnett Carbon Crossbow Bolts was exactly what I needed and requested. They will assist me in filling my freezer with vinison.
1,This Product NEVER CAME!!,"I bought these same bolts before and they worked perfectly. My husband was able to kill a cow with a single bolt! However when I tried to reorder these same exact bolts, the money was charged to from my account and then the product NEVER ARRIVED! I contacted the seller which is Amazon and have yet to receive a refund!! It has been WEEKS!"
5,Great how to on making pens,"64 pages, full color, 9 gallery pages. Step by step pictures with detailed text on how to make pens/pencils on the lathe. This book was a must for making my first pen, and a great reference as I have progressed. Pens include: Standard twist (and pencil), Dome-top, Rollerball and Fountain, Cigar pen, Flat-top click pen, Flat-top twist pen, and desk pen."
5,The Mirror of Enlightenment,"Reading Sue Jones' words was like looking into a mirror of my life over the past two years. I read it and did the workbook type activities in one sitting (through the fibrofog), it is an entertaining, enlightening and honest portrayal of what FMS is. While I purchased this book for myself it is a must read for family members dealing with FMS themselves. This book won't make them feel guilty and will help them know how much we appreciate them."
2,Personal account of Fibromyalgia,"Sue Jones write helpful personal account of fibromyalgia. She groups Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue together and simply refers to them as FMS. This does a bit of diservice to CFS. They do have over-lapping symptoms, but CFS doesn't have many characteristic symptoms that fibromyalgia has. Generally, her account is readable although she does discusses (briefly) only one treatment (unusual) treatment that has helped her. I would not recommend this book as source the sole source of understanding FMS/CFS or its treatments. It is a readable account of one person's experience, but overall does not offer many insights."
4,Thank you Sue Jones!,"This book is written from the heart and touched my heart tremendously. First book I've ever read on Fibro/CFS that explained the pain that I've experienced. Thank you Sue Jones!!! I can use this book to help my husband and family understand my condition better.I meant to give this book 5 stars, can not figure out how to change it now"
5,Must Have Book,"I received ""Parting The Fog"" in the mail and decided to glance through it before bed. At 2 o'clock in the morning, I finally finished it. I simply could not put it down. Sue Jones understands and writes about every single aspect of having Fibromyalgia/Chronic Fatigue. The reader and fellow sufferer feels so comforted and understood, because it details her daily life and struggle. Everyone with fibromyalgia should have this book and ask their family and friends to read it. It will help them understand, so much better, what it's like to have this disease. It's not that long and is a very easy read. We recommend this book to members at our support group meeting every month, and I highly recommend it to those with fibro and those who love them."
4,Good insights,"It was an easy read but very insightful as to what people go through, symptoms, frustrations. I think it helped give validity to the person in my family diagnosed with FMS -- he didn't feel as crazy."
1,After 90 minutes i was still waiting for the laughs,"This movie follows hot on the heels of the success of ""Blades of Glory"" - but cannot be compared in a favourable way at all . The trailer for this movie was what prompted me to buy it and how much i enjoyed ""Blades of Glory"" - I was very disappointed , it just never took off and i certainly tried hard to find anything funny in 90 minutes .Personally it might have succeeded more with a different cast & better script ."
2,SILLY HARMLESS FUN! 2 1/2 STARS!,"'Balls Of Fury' isn't a great film, but it has some very funny moments. Silly and harmless with some good comedic performances by Walken, Lopez and Co. It's a short film that's pretty easy to sit through, if your in the mood for this sort of thing. Lots of jokes about.......balls! If ya get my drift. ;-b"
4,Some good laughs.,"This movie got some good laughs out of me, so it's worth watching for the endorphin boost. The comedy resembles many other sports spoofs and I love the quirky humor and stunts, but you have to like this type of comic formula to get into it. It isn't the goal of these types of flicks to have a lot of depth, just make you laugh. Christopher Walken is great in this type of movie because you don't expect him to be funny (also loved watching him in the new 'Hairspray' with John Travolta). Rent this one before you buy, but if you're into collecting movies like 'Scary Movie', etc., you'll want to add this one to your comedy shelf as well.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,not great,This movie was not very funny and I was bored through most of it. Don't waste your time or money watching it.
3,Silly,"If you like these types of movies, this is the perfect movie for you. I could not decide on 3 or 4 stars, as I have seen better parody movies than this. The sport spoofed in this is Ping Pong. There are some funny scenes in this film, but it is not the best movie, and I would recommend that you watch this movie or rent before you buy, as it is not for everyone."
5,hilarious movie -- it brings great honor to us all,"balls of fury has many funny lines of dialog , especially James Hong -- his dialog is great. THe lead character (Randy) isn't quite as funny , but I suppose he was supposed to be ironic. George Lopez has a few good lines ( not many ). James Hong steals the show.Maggie Q is OK but unconvincing as Dan's love interest.Brandon Lee is funny, he is such a tough guy then plays this schtick so well.For me, its a great movie. I played ping pong in high school with many chinese dudes ( most didn't speak english well at all ) , so the cultural references and ping pong action scenese were great for me.If you don't play ping pong or don't know chinese-ish culture ( i.e., american style ) it might not work for you.Chris Walken? the same old Chris walken, but in this movie he buys his clothes from Elton John's garage sales :)"
4,mixed feelings,"We watched balls of fury, it was quite funny, and decently clean,however some very serious issues were made light of like human trafficking. We will not watch it again."
2,Disappointing,"I am so disappointed with this film. I wasn't expecting much from this flick, after all, just look at the title. I was hoping that it would at least be enjoyable, but it almost is a waste of time. This is definitely one of those movies where the best scenes are shown in the trailers. So, if you have seen the trailers, you have seen the best parts of the movie. The rest of the movie is a thing where you smile at best, there never is a bust-a-gut laughing moment. Such a sad thing to admit, because I love Christopher Walken as an actor. He is always interesting to watch, but even he is kind of dull in Balls of Fury. This is worth watcing on TV for sure when it is free, and maybe renting, but I wouldn't buy this movie. It is only worth buying if you find it dirt cheap used."
2,Insipid time waster,"This movie contains one fantastically hilarious joke, a couple of chuckles, and a slew of corny sight gags and banal ""wackiness"". However, the humor wasn't so dreadful that I was disgusted, and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't sink to anywhere near the depths of vulgarity that most films of this ilk plumb, so I give it 2 stars."
2,Failure Of Comedy,"I don;t even want to explain what this is about, it's just not worth me saying anything more then you should avoid having to sit through this movie. It's jokes are lame, it's humor is dull and it's plot is a seen-it-before 100 times scenario.The pacing is too fast, the ... euhh, sigh... take my word on it, avoid it."
2,"So Bad, It's Good","This is one of those guilty pleasure movies; it's really bad, but its degree of putridness is so severe that it's impossible to turn away from. Whether it's the bad acting, stupid dialogue, nut-knocking jokes, or sexual/racial/social stereotypes that offend your sense and sensibilities, this movie has it all! I recommend lowering your expectations and simply enjoying campy acting by Christopher Walken and the rest of the cast.So bad, it's good! But not good enough to say it's really good. It's not."
2,One word: LAME,"I liked dodgeball and assumed this movie would be similar. Which it was, except for the funny. It didn't have it. I want the last hour and a half of my life back."
1,wrong dvd sent!,"There was another dvd in the ""Ball of Fury"" case. I would like to replace it, as it is an unrated movie, NOT appropriate for my family. How do I do this??"
1,Couldn't stand to watch the whole thing!!!,What a waste of time and money. Halfway through it I turned it off! Where were these funny moments? They certainly weren't in the beginning to middle and by that point you've lost me. It was far from funny and completely lame.
4,Stupid Funny,"I liked this movie because it doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. It's ""stupid"" funny (fart jokes, silly faces, sexual innuendo, etc). There is no deep message or mind-blowing special effects. If you want to watch a movie that you can just shut your brain off for and laugh, then ""Balls of Fury"" is it!The interviews in the bonus features were very funny!"
3,"This got slammed by critics, but","it really wasen't all that bad. There was a minimum of gross outs, which was unusual for this type of movie. Hardly any bad language, some amusing scenes, and the main character was kind of endearing. The man who played the ping pong training master has been in so many movies, and he always looked old, I wonder what his real age is. And of course that wonderful head case, Christopher Walken, who was perfect for the revenge filled villian, he really camped it up with the kimono's and poofy hair-do's. Not high brow stuff, but reasonable harmless entertainment."
2,"no masterpiece,but has its moments (2.5/5)","this is not a great movie by any means.but it is a movie that takesping pong(or table tennis)to the next level.the spoof level,that is. asfar as i know this is the first spoof that's been made about thegame.there are some chuckles here,but no real big laughs.it's sort oflike ""Karate Kid"" but with Ping Pong.and obviously done with tonguefirmly planted in cheek.it's fast paced,and has lots ofaction.Christopher Walken is the highlight of course,though we have towait quite awhile to see him.you won't likely be bored while watchingthis flick.but i wouldn't expect anything resembling comedy of the fastand furious variety.for me,Balls of Fury is a 2.5/5"
2,Waste of time & money,weak plot...the relationship of Randy Daytona and Fong's niece wasn't fully developed for them to be in love with each other. Loved Maggie Q though. The training was just a waste of film time and it didn't even show how Randy got his pingpong playing skills back in such a short time. Seems like this movie just wanted to fast forward to the end. I couldn't even imagine Christopher Walken to star in this movie. The pingpong special effects though was great! There were some comedic moments but not enough to really muster a good laugh. Rent this one first before buying.
2,Only the Ping Pong parts are funny,"That's right, if they arent playing ping pong in super insane fast speeds, the storyline gets pretty dull. Save your money, not worth buying unless you are a BIG ping pong fan."
2,2 stars is being generous,"Dan Fogler is an overweight stoner in this 2007 film, who plays ping pong and is a total loser in life otherwise. The redeeming part of this film is the performances given by Christopher Walken, Cathy Shim, George Lopez, Maggie Q, James Hong, Terry Crews, Robert Patrick, Aisha Tyler, Jason Scott Lee, Toby Huss, David Koechner, Kerri Kenney, La Na Shi (the Dragon), Brandon Molale, Kiralee Hayashi, Nancy Davis, Emily Wang, and Elmira Zainabudinova; all of which carry the film in spite of Dan Fogler. It would probably help if you were drunk or stoned while you watch this film I'm guessing. Pretty much if you seen the trailers on TV advertising this film, you've seen the best of it. Too bad it's PG-13, Cathy Shim is captivating but only a little because of the PG-13 limitations. There are some decent special effects and interesting pretend world talent, as well as some legitimate ping pong playing talent. The humor is low brow, without being completely lewd."
2,Dropped the Ball,"I wish this movie lived up to the reviews I saw. Sadly it didn't. It had good actors, so it should have. It had good stunts so it should have. All it was missing was a believable plot line. Damn, I hate it when that happens."
1,skip hop diaper bag review.,The bag came smashed and the front pockets never got their shape back. The bag was functional but looked worn out within the first month.
3,too tall and not big enough,"I have a 7 month old and after 3 months of use with this bag, I ended up getting another one.Pros - My husband isn't embarrassed to use it. Hangs on the stroller. Lots of pockets. Price is OKAY.Cons - Way too narrow. It's really hard to see inside. Not big enough."
3,"big, but not big enough","I love the color, but just like the bag. I thought it would be bigger. It holds my stuff, but doesn't open very wide. And it only holds the bare minimum... not much room for toys or more than 2 bottles... it's not an ALL day or overnight bag. But it does the job I suppose. If you only need to take the bare minimum then it's fine otherwise go for something bigger!"
3,soso,"its a good drive, a bit pricy and bulky. it worked wonderfly for me for about 3 months then it had a hard time reading media and made dvd coasters. getting it to read anything now is like playing on a slot machine. im still working with tech support to rectify the problem."
5,Unique and Great for Beginners,"This book does something almost no dictionary does: it shows you the English definition, the Cyrillic word, and the English transliteration, so it helps with vocabulary, pronunciation, and word/character recognition.The main section is grouped by topic, but there are complete Russian-English and English-Russian sections which also show all three forms.Very simple concept - unique and invaluable."
2,"Basic, Handy, but Inaccurate","I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone who expects to use Russian in a live setting. Yes, it may be handy, but not something you'd want to actually study from. Better to get it from someone who knows and uses the language."
3,Yet to be use-tested,"I ordered Streetwise Berlin because it was billed as a sort of definitive map of all Berlin's strasses. Described as an 8-pager, it turns out being a single sheet accordion with multiple folds (why misrepresent its bulk?) & with coverage of only central Berlin (several locations I'll be visiting & had hoped to locate on this map were beyond its scope). Still, the lamination does make it both durable & easy to handle, & although it's far from being fully detailed even within its zone (minor streets aren't included) & at $7.95 seems over-priced, it does at least provide fundamental orientation & may prove fairly useful. We'll see."
5,Best street map series available,"I've bought a number of these maps over the years to use for navigating European cities. They are the best available. Very clear and consise, small and durable; great for carrying in your pocket. They are very well designed, laying out the center city and the tourist spots in a very clear grid. However, the small print does require reading glasses, a small price to pay for such a great map."
4,Berlin map,"This Streetwise map, which was delivered later than promised from Amazon and too late for my trip to Germany, turned out to be less than hoped for in that its area was too confined to the center area of the city and insufficient for use beyond the center. I have used Streetwise maps for other cities in Europe, but this was more limited for general use than the others. They are convenient, but a larger city paper map was more useful in this case anyway."
5,Perfect for travel,"I have the Streetwise Munich map and it is my favorite, so I ordered the Streetwise Berlin map and it is great, too. I love that it can be pulled out and used in the rain and that it won't be ripping apart like other maps. This map has most of the areas I go to on it, but not Schöneberg."
4,"Very Unique, Very Solid","Maybe I'm an ignorant American, but I find this type of music very unusual and unique. He's a lot like Beck, to me, in his random-style mood setting songs. He's a lot more bouncy, energetic, structured, and electronic than Beck, but that's the best comparison I can think of.If you haven't heard of him, I'd check out the 28 Days Later soundtrack first, he did a remix of Ave Maria on that that's amazing."
4,Jacknife Lee - Punk Rock High Roller,"Jacknife Lee knows how to have a good time, and on his second album, PUNK ROCK HIGH ROLLER, he revels in them, whether the surf guitar strums of ""1970's Dictator Chic"" or the Hawaiian groove of ""Aloha Satellite Special."" The party on ""Do You Thing Cornball"" is plenty funky, even if Lee's voice has a bit of deadpan to it (you'd think his announcement of ""I Love Your Sauce"" would be more emphatic, at least!) But it's all in good fun. When he goes for lounge relaxation, as on ""I Think About You"" or couuntry twang of ""Easy,"" he taps that early 2000s downtempo vibe. The strings that chase the bass on ""My Baby Got the Beat"" are appropriately grand, but it's ""Bursting Off the Backbeat"" and really effervesces. The final track, ""Jacknife Is Your Friend, Let Me In"" is a radio station beamed in from the planet of easy-listening, and it's a satisfying cap to a joyous, upbeat album."
5,The New Folk Sound,"When I heard that there was a new band made up from the, um, Make Up, I had to wonder. For me, the Make Up had already said everything they needed to, which wasn't much, beyond Yeah! Always more of a live act than a songwriting team, the Make Up were stylish live entertainment with albums that never seemed as cool as they should have been. Fortunately, Scene Creamers are working both sides of the street! Their shows are driving, ass-shaking affairs, just as you might expect, punctuated with the acid-tongued drollery of scenester Ian Svenonious. And the album? Even better! The most consistant set of songs ever to come from this group. Real pop-folk material, laced with psychedelic touches and delivered with a punkish push, as well as some hilarious lyrics. Plus, the song ""Elfin Orphan"" is a classic rock song. Make way for the new breed - Scene Creamers magnifique!"
2,Can I get a whatever?,"Sadly dissapointing. After the promising ""Weird War"" lp, Ex-Makeup members Ian Svenious and Michelle Mae lastest endeavor falls flat. This album feels like a run through the motions for these two. Ian trots out his usual high pitched ""New Soul"" vox with lyrics intertwining political parnoia and broken hearts. However the psychedilec soul meets punk sound that worked so well in the Make-Up and Weird War, here is unispired. Perhaps the problem is the lack of Neil Haggerty's or James Canty's exceptional guitar work or perhaps even Ian doesn't believe the stuff he is singing anymore."
3,to the moron who wrote the last review...,"if you knew anything about music and didn't just follow the underground trends...'five years ago when you first started listening to the make-up' (wow, you're so ahead of your time)... you'd know that the make-up have nothing on james chance. He over-shadows them in every way... sound, style, soul... oh yeah, and he did it 10 or 15 years before the make-up crawled their way out of the dc scene. ever heard of the no-wave movement? don't get me wrong, this is a decent album and it's lightyears better than most make-up or NoU material, but that's not saying much..."
3,Not a Game-changer,"I got this as a test--to see how a ceramic blade would compare with high-end Japanese and German steel.The result--pretty good. It's very handsome--especially the black blade--but so light in the hand that it's a bit hard to control, and there are lots of ""don't""s (Don't pry, twist, drop, or hack) that require attentiveness in using it. Out of the box, it's amazingly sharp, but the keen edge did not hold up very long--a big surprise. Although I didn't attempt a scientific comparison, my guess is that the edge did not last any longer than the blades made by Shen, Mac, and Wustof. Restoring that edge, of course, is a specialized business that Kyocera recommends not be done at home.And so, I still find occasional use for this implement, but less and less as time gows on. I am sure that for light use, it will be more than satisfactory. For more than that, the competition seems to be ahead."
3,For my safety,"Everything about it was fine, EXCEPT, the tip was rounded. The instructions said this was for ""my safety"". It's great that Mr. Koyocera is worried about me, but I bought a new ceramic knife to replace the old one precisely BECAUSE it had a very sharp tip that didn't round, as steel knives tend to do with repeated sharpening. Thanks a lot."
2,"Sharp yes, durable no",This knife is light and has an edge. I was quite excited about it the first day. It cut tomatoes and onions cleanly with no bruising. But when I went to slice a day old baguette for french toast on the following morning the edge chipped away in many little shards. Day two and the knife is basically destroyed. It looks terrible and I'm afraid to us it again. I wonder where all the broken jaggy bits of knife ended up. Probably in the french toast I ate before noticing the sad state of the blade.
4,picture perfect,"Great product for simple contemporary framing - looks finished & very professional to float an image in-between glass matts [photo or paintings; in my case, 'original painting & collage art' on handmade paper by artist Diane Schroeder; [...]- quantity incentive on multiple purchases of 4 or more frames; came shipped in several deliveries, so alot of packing materials and tracking and charging info. I have purchased this product before and this is value driven vs. retail stores. Frame can be hung or stand alone with included table easel. Watch for any broken or chipped glass. I recommend this Umbra 'Behold' product."
1,head set,This headset is garbage. It's broke and I haven't had it for three months. The wiring is paper thin
1,disappointment,"A previous reviewer said it's only 10 bucks. The price seems to have doubled and the quality halved. I can hear other callers crystal clear. The problem is this: they keep saying, ""What? What? I can't hear you. Hello?"" Microphone adjustment doesn't make a considerable improvement. This headset is for those who like to listen. If you'd like to join the conversation, your words will fall on deaf ears!"
2,"Good for listening, not for talking.","I bought this thinking it will really save my time. But, it proved not of much use to me because the microphone seems to be not that good. The person on the other side can't hear me properly, it's feeble & I have to switch back to hand-full mode instead of hands-free."
4,Headset,"The headset is good, just too big for over the ear. My ears just happen to be a bit on the small side!"
2,Noisy and Cheap,"I purchased the V-Tech phone partly because of the ability to use a headset with it, which is very convenient since I do a lot of working from hom. However, I used this headset once before the microphone broke away from the earpiece where it swivels. The sound quality in the earpiece is poor, with noisy am-radio-quality sound. The phone itself is great, but I plan to replace this headset with one from another manufacturer."
4,"Great item, but different price for color","I like kitchen-aid products, however when shopping it for a gift, the same machine, the Artisan 5 qt. stand mixer was quite a few dollars more costly from the rest in the class because I selected the ""Boysenberry color"" The product is efficient but I would alert anyone before buying to consider the color, it maybe a lot more than advertised."
5,Smells Great,"I bought this as a ""tester"" before I went ahead and purchased a bigger size. I absolutely love this smell! It is unique and not like any other perfume I have smelt. It is a sexy. classy perfume. Love it."
1,Too Much For Too Little,"I spent over 100 dollars for this carrier and it really is only worth about 45 dollars. The wicker pokes out into the carrier so when my pet leans against the side she get pricked. Also, the gate that closes the carrier is held on by three small plastic belts which does not securely hold the gate onto the front of the carrier. The belts also do not look like they are going to last for a long period of time since they are plastic. If I were you, I would invest in one of the wicker pet crates that are sturdier and more secure."
4,EZ Pop -- Over the Top (and terrific!),"These Vikki Carr LPs were played all over the place in the early 70s & it's great to hear them again. Vikki's voice soars over highly dramatic arrangements of these cover versions.Great stuff from Vikki's ""2nd Phase""..."
3,Expanding on Goethe,"I read this item after completing Kaufmann's translation of Faust. It certainly helped my understanding of the original text, although I am sure I would not have enjoyed the experience quite as much had I not read the actual work. I recommend not attempting to pick up the Cliff's Notes with the expectation of receiving the full benefit of Goethe; it is, however, a good place to turn if you need clarification, details, explanation of diction or allusion, or even an idea with which to start off a paper. Not a replacement for reading Faust, but a good resource to use in addition to the text."
2,Not so great,"Grandmothers and church bazaar knitters will enjoy these patterns. Some of the instructions could be better, but most are within the reach of average knitters."
5,"Fun, fun...Merry Christmas stockings!","From the shape of the book itself (like a children's Christmas story book) to the very clear and easily followed instructions, this book has a lovely variety of Christmas stockings in it. It's great for beginner sock knitters, and experienced knitters can take the basics and run with them.It looks great in my knitting basket, too."
5,2nd review,"The condition of this book was exactly as stated. Actually it was like brand new. The mailing process couldn't have been more professional.Thank you, lk"
2,"""The Mosquito Guy""","I purchased this item several years ago and was disappointed with what I paid for this item. First of all,the item is very time intensive when it comes to putting up the structure.The roof tarp was very hard to put on; when I first tried to put it on, it would not slide thru the tract-as a matter of fact it ripped! Second, after I finally got the tarp on, there were a lot of gaps along the sides of the tarp and the bugs still got in.Third-good luck in taking off the tarp to those who live in northern climates because if you do not take it off, ""the snow will"".The third year of purchasing the product, I got so tired of trying to get the tarp on-I finally ended up in building a permanent roof structure.I do not recommend this item for anyone who plans on taking off the tarp, because it will not hold up. For what I paid for this item-""Thumbs Down""."
5,Great Find,Book arrived quickly and was in great condition. The person who I ordered it for is really enjoying it. The price was right!
4,So easy to read and I learned something new,"The history of the struggles, frustrations, and achievements of black women is depicted in an easy-flowing narrative fashion. The shortcomings and lack of freedom of opportunity for black women (and white women to a lesser degree) to achieve cultural and economic recognition and success on an equal level with men in a white male-dominated society are realistically described. I acquired a deeper appreciation of the emotional, inner-soul frustrations and struggles, especially of the black women, and the difficulties encountered in maintaining even the most basic family life. In spite of all this, we see black women taking their rightful place in society and accomplishing their goals. I enjoyed the book and learned something new. Sabina M. Nowak"
4,Really Nice Multi-Function Peripheral!,"I bought the Brother MFC 8300 for my 2 business locations as well as my home office. I've been very satisfied with the excellent print quality and the speed is great! Pages fly out of this baby! I use Macintosh computers and apparently there is a PC Fax software feature that I cannot use but I don't see the need as it works as a standalone fax machine and has the phone handset , so it could stand in for your phone as well. I also use the ""copy"" function which even includes reduce and enlarge, making up to 99 copies.It's a great all around machine for a small business or home office combining copy and fax features with a great 600 dpi, 12 page per minute laser printer."
4,Great till Baby got teeth,"My baby liked this a lot starting whenever he could grab things, but as his teeth came in, the paint started to chip. Since I don't know what's in it, I felt uncomfortable letting him continue to eat paint bits and hid the toy in the closet, which is too bad because he really did enjoy gnawing on it. It's easy to grab, especially if you pull the triangles apart enough to lock them together, making them stiff (though you lose the ""rattle"" aspect).Overall the toy was a success, until he started eating the paint."
3,Not a Favorite,"Obviously every child is different, but unfortunately my 9 month old does not spend much time with this toy. Possibly he would have liked it when he was younger. I recently bought 4 Haba toys and he really enjoys Trix and Flapsi. He was not very impressed with Ballino after the first day. Hopefully he will go through a stage when they are more interesting. I am still very happy with Haba products. My son does have 6 teeth and so far the paint is not wearing off, but I will post an update if it does."
3,440 is made for Subaru only.,"Don't buy this rack system unless you own a Subaru Forester or Outback. It won't fit any other car. You must also purchase the appropriate adapter for your model. It's best to phone Thule and find the rack system that will fit your car before ordering from Amazon. Looks like a well made product, though."
1,A lengthy job application for the next Supreme Court vacancy,"Not persuasive. If you are already there, this book will confirm your prejudices. If not, you won't be swayed.Perjury is perjury and there just ain't no getting around it. If you must buy this, buy Ann Coulter's better analysis from the other side of the spectrum and read both together."
1,Promising title -- poor delivery.,"I am convinced that there are two Dershowitzs -- the sometimes rational thinker and the biased, arrogant law professor. I got the book on the assumption that I would get the rational Dershowitz. Wrong. This is much of the same drivel you see in several of his other books and writings. Sexual McCarthyism is an intriguing concept but don't expect to learn much about it in this book. Keep your receipt, you'll want to throw this one back."
4,Excellent (though disjointed & non-flowing).,"I thought this was an excellent case for the defense. It is a disjointed book, to be sure: a new 30-page introduction precedes a series of prior published articles. The result is that you find yourself going over familiar ground over & over. I understand this was necessary to get the book out in time for the impeachment trial (and to ward off claims of 20-20 hindsight). Still, it's a viewpoint worth reading about. There are plenty of books out with the other side - we can see Ann Coulter on any number of food fight talk shows (and absolving Richard Nixon in the process on the O'Reilly Factor). As much as I disliked Dershowitz during the OJ trial, this was a better effort."
4,"He ""hits"" the nail on the head.","A ""good read"". I loved the book though at times the fact it was a dated essay, resulted in some repetition of thoughts."
5,FASCINATING!,I'm so bummed they dropped this show in mid-stream. I watch these over and over. Watching them while reading Ekman's books and watching Ekman himself on YouTube is a great addition to my autodidactic passion for human nature.
5,Great serie !,"Awesome serie ! Exciting in every minute !Just waiting a good discount for second season.It has PT-BR subtitle for all episodes but not for the extras, unfortuately."
5,Devistating,A very good show. Great cast. Great concepts. Worth every penny. Can't wait for season 2 now
2,Good for Insomniacs,"As mentioned above, if you really have trouble sleeping, just play any of the discs in the set, including, or mainly, the pilot. Although the idea is good, the makers of this series mercilessly spoiled it. I got bored with the pilot, but decided to give it a try for the next 3 episodes. Absolute waste of time. the acting is bad, the characthers unconvincing,and the stories themselves are totally predictible. The only positive note I have is Tim Roth, he is so above the other actors. Too bad for him."
2,Where are the actors?,Just finished episode 2 of season 1 and decided to sell it again. I was not able to find some decent acting besides Tim Roth. His female sidekick is as bad as Cuddy in House - besides personal assistant look alike dresses there is nothing that she brings to the table. Did not like the stories either - I fell victim to the hype on the recommendations page for this item. I like Tim Roth though and I am happy he (hopefully) makes some money out of it. Glad to have sold it as I write this to minimize my losses.
5,Lie to Me,"I really enjoyed this program. I not only found it interesting, but find the body language right on point. I cannot figure out if that is a good thing or not."
5,I love the main character's wry sense of humor,"This is a really interesting show about a guy who is a ""deception specialist."" That is, he reads people's facial expressions and body language to determine if they're lying or telling the truth. He is hired by local and federal law enforcement agencies to help solve a variety of cases.I like the way they occasionally show clips of famous people, such as Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, etc., to compare their expressions to the suspects in the show. I also enjoy the main character's wry sense of humor, as well as his interactions with the supporting cast of characters."
5,Lie to Me dvd season 1,This is about The Lightman Group headed by Dr. Cal Lightman and Dr. Jillian Foster. You get to find out about the home lives of these doctors and about what they do. They read facial expressions. This will help their clients to know if the person is lying to them or telling the truth. They work with the FBI and individual companies. I liked it so well that I bought all three seasons and plan to watch them over and over.
5,Fantastic product,"Fantastic product, this tv show is one of the great ones. Well done, great actors, great writers, i'm waiting for the next season, will be a must have in my collection."
2,DVD quality fine; show annoying,"The DVD quality is fine. If you like the show (as many do) you will be fine with the DVD. I was referred to this item because I had gotten the Mentalist. This show is much more over the top with the references to reading expressions etc which is all the ability the main character needs to figure things out so the plot feels to me more like a succession of tricks than actual plot. I find the main character annoying, and the rivalry between the main character and the ""natural"" untrained character trite. This is, of course, just personal preference, but if you too are looking into this as a fan of The Mentalist, you may want to watch an episode before buying a full season of this."
3,"Overpriced for 13 episodes, and poor ending","it's a good show, I like the premise, I enjoy watching it, but 32 bucks for 13 episodes is a little costly. combine that with I just finished it and I thought the season ending was lame... no suspense, no tension, nothing it just basically ends an episode and the result is I felt I needed to put a review up- save your money tell it comes down in price- 20 bucks would be about the right price."
2,Racist writers.,"The Hispanic main character is uneducated, promiscuous, has an alcoholic abusive father, and a sister in Jail. None of these problems are seen in the Cuacasian or African American characters. I guess the writers were ok assuming only minorities have these problems. It's disgusting."
