5,Really like the new Norelco,I like the close shave and the way you can clean this new Razor. It's so simple just place it under hot water and blow it dry. Can't be any simpler than that.
2,No comparison to the Reflex Action,"When the battery died on my 5885xl reflex action, I decided to upgrade to the 6885xl. Big mistake. The Reflex Action plowed through my beard - no problem - two minutes. The Quadra - maybe its the two stage thing, maybe its the fact that there are less blades - I gotta shave 2-3 times just to get some hair off. Returned the shaver to Norelco - got me another Reflex Action - I figured I would have the same problem with the Spectra."
2,Keep your Blade,"I have had 3 electric razors. An inexpensive Braun, a Remington and now this Norelco. This is by far the most expensive one, but not much better than the $89.00 Braun I had. It's just OK. To get anything close to a blade you have to go over the same area several times. I have found this to be very drying on my skin. My recommendation, If you want a close shave, keep you blade"
2,"Great on face, lousy on neck","While this razor performed excellent on my face, the neck left a lot to be desired. It would leave patches of hair on my neck. I would run the razor as long as my neck to take it suffering from razor burn. If you have a tough or thick beard I would not reccomend this razor as it doesn't do well on the neck."
1,re cut version,"I had an origiinal DVD version of Breaker Morant which I gifted to my grandaughter because I thought it was the best ""war"" movie I had ever seen. I ordered the current version being offered by Amazon and I hope it is unique but I have just returned it because someone has cut up the original version and mixed up the movie in such a way to ruin it. The current version starts with Breaker and the others being shot, then jumps to the trial then to Captain Hunt being killed and omits lage portions. I think someone should review the current version and get it corrected otherwise it makes a mockery of a great story and film. TH"
5,Highly recommended,"Along with Kubrick's Paths of Glory, this film ranks tops among its genre. During the Boer wars in Austrailia, Morant and his associates are prisoners to be executed for something stupid. While in custody, the Boers attack and Morant and his men are given rifles and fight valiently to stave off the attack. What does this act of bravery earn them! The answer is a big resounding nothing. Like the previously mentioned movie, it shows you how egos in the military get in the way of justice! Great acting and directing along with a story that is compelling to the last scene!"
5,POLITICS TRIUMPHS OVER INTEGRITY,This true story just once more emphasizes that politicians will sacrafice others for their own gain.
5,This is what comes of empire building,"A must see for those fans of courtroom drama and historical war movies.""The fact of the matter is that war changes men's natures. The barbarities of war are seldom committed by abnormal men. The tragedy of war is that these horrors are committed by normal men in abnormal situations; situations in which the ebb and flow of everyday life have departed and have been replaced by a constant round of fear and anger, blood and death. Soldiers at war are not to be judged by civilian rules...Even though they commit acts which calmly viewed afterwards could only be seen as unchristian and brutal...[W]e can not hope to judge such matters unless we ourselves have been submitted to the same pressures, the same provocations, as these men, whose actions are on trial."" - Closing speech by Major Thomas"
1,A DVD that doesn't play,"I received this DVD and it does not play. It seems strange that it would be shipped all the way from England and then not work. My dvd player said ""eject this disc. it will not play"" I tried it over and over and it just does not play."
2,no return policy. sent back video no credit no response,"VHS only works on southern hemisphere vhs players. I returned the vhs and never received a credit, cash back or return e-mail. Very disappointed."
5,Terrific morality story with fine acting,Breaker Morant is a terrific (and true) morality story with fine acting. One of my favorite movies. Looks great in Hi-def!
3,Breaker Morant DVD,"There was a scratch or chip in the middle that caused a momentary freeze in theaction and I thought the DVD was no good. However, once it got past that one bitit was fine.It got here very quickly and I'd have no trouble ordering from this Vendor as Iknew it was ""used"" when I bought it.The film is a classic, true, story and not to be missed. Kevin D."
2,Very Starkly Brittish,I bought this movie hoping for the best. It was boring. Very slow and plodding. Almost no character development. I had a hard time forcing myself to watch it all the way. To put it in a very simple term. This movie sucks....completely.
3,Not much of a movie.,"This story could have been told in about 30 minutes.It was an interesting plot but not much of a movie.The acting was good and the attention to detail inwardrobe and weapons great.All in all pretty depressing.A reminder that there are all to often to many rules layeddown to conduct war politically. Instead of waging war.Politicians, ask your general to complete an objective.And then stay the hell out of the way."
1,Fictional account of Breaker Morant.,"This movie is a fictional account of the trial and conviction of killer Breaker Morant.It is unfortunate that Australian filmmakers have a chip on their shoulder about Britain and it has been suggested that the reason is that those in favour of an Australian republic attack Britain at every opportunity to promote their cause.At any rate,there has never been an Australian film made that is historically true(the Dish,for example is fiction).I am an Australian so my opinion is unbiased."
1,Fictional Movie.,"It is unfortunate that Breaker Morant has been portrayed as history as it is a FICTIONAL movie which continued the chip on the shoulder attitude of Australian movie makers against Britain.Yes,Breaker Morant was a killer and yes he deserved his penalty.The movie is a fictional account of what happened."
5,Excellent From Start to Finish,This arguably the best war movie/courtroom drama ever made. It is heartbreaking and tragic when you realize (as the characters did) that theoutcome is inevitable and that they are the scapegoats in a political manoever. The acting is flawless and the scenery simply highlights the bleek and stark reality of the end. Highly recommended.
5,Scapegoats of the British Empire,"This is a strong picture. Beresford is one of these quiet talents who turns out one brilliant film after the other without much fanfare. ""Driving Miss Daisy"" happens to be one of my favorites. This film has always been thought to be a kind of commentary on the Vietnam War, because it addresses the issue of modern war and morality. For Americans, no doubt, this would have to be true. One can't help thinking of the terrible things done in that war by our soldiers who were in most instances just trying to do their duty and obey their orders. This film is very well directed and packs an emotional punch. One immediately identifies with the soldiers charged by what seems a terribly prejudiced, evil set of British officers, who were happy to exploit the Australians while at the same time having contempt for them. One comes away feeling sympathy for the Australians and a kind of loathing for the corrupt, sickeningly smug British."
5,Breaker Morant,"An excellent movie. If you want to gain some understanding of the complexities of fighting in a guerilla or counter-insurgency war, this outstanding film is good place to start. Told from a distinctly Aussie view, the issue of soldiers making brutual choices in a brutual conflict is the same now as it was in the Boer War. If you are looking for an action packed ""Rambo"" experience, this is not the picture for you. But if you want to learn some history and gain a bit of understanding this is your film."
5,Breaker Morant,"One of the high points in Australian cinema, Beresford's devastating film recounts the true story of Australian soldiers martyred for political expediency. Accurately depicting the injustice visited upon these three ""colonials"" by their British commanders, ""Morant"" is also a magnificent character study. Thompson is terrific as the lawyer who defends the men, but Woodward's resonant, heart-rending performance in the title role is reason enough to see this stunning film."
5,Underappreciated Gem,"This movie is very well done, with crisp performances by all participants. Based on actual events, it tells the story from a very pro-Aussie anti-British point of view. Regardless of this bias, the story is well told , believable and moving. Quite a thought provoking, yet enjoyable drama. (BTW, I have heard that this was Ronald Regan's favorite film, not sure if that was true or not.)"
5,Excellent book!,"This is a great book for the people who what to know more about buddhism, hinduism, taoism and tantra. You can learn the practices like meditation."
5,Wonderful cd of regional rockabilly!!!,"Another fine set of obscure rockabillies from Ace Records of England(the also have an exellent ""Jiving Jamboree"" series). Ace records out of the UK has been issuing great and forgotte nrockabily and R&B great from the 50's, and most of thier cd's are exellent(particularly thier Wanda Jackson disc). In any case this cd is well worth picking up, after you already have all the essentials, and common stuff and you want more. If you don't happen to have a cd of obscure but great rockabilly performances, and you can't find your local bootleggers copies of ""Ultra Rare Rockabillies"", go for this great cd."
3,Conflicted Opinion,"Well, to be honest, I love this stereo's sound. I don't live in a big room, but I just love that even when the bass is all the way up and the volume is moderately high, it's not muffled or distorted. All of the other stereos I've heard do that. To me, clarity is just as important as the bass.HOWEVERI've had this stereo since September of 2003, and in the past two years it's really started to go downhill and I have no idea why. It only plays about 40% of the cds I put in it and hardly ever plays burned albums anymore. It skips alot and seems to get confused very often.Obviously this is very frustrating. Does anyone else who owns this know what I can do?"
4,not bad at all,"Dont listen to the people who complain that this system has no bass .. because unless you have 30,000 foot room in your house to fill with sound, this will give you all the bass you need. if heard this system befor, and while i dont find it to be as good as the hx-z1 (the stereo i decided to purchase) its still a decent system. clean mids, and clear sharp highs with minimal hiss. the 2 20cm 110 watt subs give plenty of bass reaching down to 30hz. a good system for those who canta fford the pricier models. i.e. Hx-z1 , Hx-z3, mx-gt80/90"
1,ugh,"I listened to this great-looking system in Best Buy one day. UGH, it sounded like horse ****. The highs and mids (or highs and semi-highs) blow. The bass is moderate, but no good for a setup that elaborate-looking. The mxgt80 still reigns supreme."
1,ZERO BASS!,"Listening to this thing in the store was terribly disappointing, since it has practically no bass! Especially when compared to JVC's last 2 Giga-Tube models from last year, the GT80 and GT90! Don't let the Giga-Tube on this model fool you, it is just there for looks, because it doesn't seem to serve any purpose! It's just too bad that JVC had to mess with a good thing! Don't buy this model, but try to get your hands on a new or used GT80/GT90, which feature true band-pass boxes, and you will find the bass you are looking for!"
2,whens it going to get here,"i have been waiting it says its been being prepared for shipment for 3 days now when the hell is it going to ship out ,"
4,Great FARMS Information!,This book was a great book to read. It was a little slow at the begining but I was really captivated by all the great FARMS info in it. But I don't like it when books end so abruptly as this one did. It has a sequel that is needed to finish out the story line.
4,Couldn't Put it Down!,"Fantastic read. Very research based so I loved it. Informative and put together in a way that is much more interesting to read than a research paper for sure! This book shows archeological proof of validity of ancient records found in America. The records talk about their battles, their religion, and their politics. The reading is a little bit complex and should be read carefully but can be very enjoyable."
2,Made in England,"This book is from England, and although it's easy enough to read, there are no pictures or facts pertaining to American engines. Also, not enough or correct information is given concerning porting."
2,The experienced engine builder need not buy this book,Not much new information unless you are a novice.
5,"What a novelty, an actual beginners book.","There are 15 chapters to this book; I just completed the last one tonight.What a joy!First, this is a book for beginners that is actually easy to follow and I never felt like I was reading an intermediate or advanced book masquerading as a beginner's book. The color illustrations throughout the book really do aid in one's comprehension.Equally important - I never ran across a single error. I've read and tried to follow computer books that have you follow along, only to have you end up with an example not working and, therefore, confusing you. This book was error free - every example I tried (and I tried every one) worked.As I said this is a beginner's book. If you're much beyond beginner level, you should probably look for something a bit more advanced.To the author - Ruth Maran - well done, exceptionally well done! I hope you write one for the next version of FrontPage."
3,XXX the demo is better XXX,"This band took way too long to get this out. I can't believe they waited all those months for P*d to do the cover art. By the way, nice picture. How long did it take to draw that? Whatever. They demo is way better than the CD and the songs that they re-recorded for the CD were not as crisp as the demo version. Great bunch of guys, straight edge hardcore is truly in their hearts and it comes out in their music but I think that this ""highly anticipated"" album doesn't fulfill it's expectations....not mine at least.XnewbalancenewjackX"
5,Remebering the Great Ones,"This book was such a great breath of fresh air! It is so good to read about African-American accomplishments, but it is even better to find out how it began. We always hear about the tennis greats of today, like the Williams' sisters but what about those African-Americans who paved the way. Doug Smith did an excellent job of presenting Dr. Johnson's story. I loved it!"
3,Happy with Product,"I am happy with the memory card. It arrived in excellent condition, worked as expected and the price ensures that I will look here before buying elsewhere in the future."
1,Junk,"I had bought a MadCatz memory card a while ago for the GC, and after a while of use, the memory card erased all files I had stored and it completely stopped working, could not function at all.And before that, I had a MC controller that broke internally after just 2 months of use.Maybe I was unlucky, I thought to myself, until someone else told me their MadCatz product turned to junk quickly also."
3,Good product with one issue.,"This is a good cover case...however, you will need to wipe it off often..it picks up lint and dust like crazy. The price here is great!"
3,"Good size, bad durability","This controller is a good size for my smaller-than-average hands.The only small problem comes in durability. For the first 6 months or so, it worked okay. Shortly thereafter, i noticed the joysticks (which are rubberized for some reason) and the rubber grips on the sides began chipping away and disintegrating in my hands. This makes for some messy gaming and dirty palms. Also, the right joystick tends to drift which is bad if you are playing shooters or games with a camera mapped to the right stick. Also, the combo feature wasn't much use to me, maybe because it's too quick when executing combos, or maybe cuz i don't play a lot of fighting games.Either way, it's not a bad controller, but it's not the answer to all your control problems. Go controller S if you don't mind the extra 10 bucks."
3,Same as all the rest,I purchased this controller for my son thinking that it was going to work well for his small hands. I was disapointed to find that it is essentially the same size as the small microsoft controller so in that regard it has no value.
4,Finding something that works,"I straighten my hair a lot, so this was the perfect time to try something other than a blow dryer which took me about 45 minutes. I didn't use the steam, beacuase moisture makes my hair friz. I enjoyed the comb that combed out my hair while straightening, and it helped to curl under the ends of my hair, which always looks nice. It heated up quickly, and did an excellent job. It seems to be better on my hair than the blow-drying was. The only problem was that the combs got stuck in my hair because it didn't open up enough, but after a while i got the hand of it. This is an excellent product for people with curly, or wavy hair."
4,Good Info But Lots of Typos,My dog does not have cancer but I figured it would be well worth it to have this information ahead of time. The information is easy to understand and well laid out. But there are so many typos that look like they were caused when the book was formatted for the Kindle.
5,Must read for dog owners,Dr. Shaun's book is a must read for all dog owners. He gives practical advice and good information about cancer.
3,Seller Refunded my money,I purchased this book in April but it was only after making several of the recipes for Thankgiving that I sat down to go through the rest of book. To my great disappointment I found that 6 pages including 4 with Recipes had been ripped out of the book! Seller Refunded my money upon my request.
1,Short on content.,"This book is long on words but short on content. You spend so much time reading that you wonder when you are going to learn something. Instead, you keep reading. I don't know about the reviewer who says ""Dr. Jorion is clearly THE authority as far as Value-at-Risk goes."" Maybe it is the author."
2,Shallow,"Based upon its marketing, this book over-promises and under-delivers. Yes, the author uses big words like ""autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity."" He also tosses around: ""principal component analysis"", ""importance sampling"" and ""Quasi Monte Carlo."" Anyone who needs to understand these concepts will be disappointed. The explanations are shallow ... often just a single paragraph. The reader is left with an elementary book that adds little to the original RiskMetrics document. If you are new to VAR, I recommend Dowd. For more experienced professionals (especially those who need to implement a VAR system) you will need to read the original literature."
1,No longer useful,"The first edition was for a while the only book on the subject. As such, it had to be the best. But, at that time, RiskMetrics VCV approach was the only approach. Jorion analyses this approach in detail, and derives many results (for example, attributing risks, etc.). He then implies by omission that they work for other methods, they don't. He also implies by omission that RiskMetrics is the absolute greatest, it isn't - it's probably now the weakest method. Surveys show that now only 10% of banks worldwide are using this method - and the numbers are falling.There is nothing about coherence, the problems with VaR, the fundamental problems with using it to allocate risks to portfolios...There was no reason to bring out a new edition."
3,General Treatise on Risk Management,"This second edition has evolved into a general treatise on risk management. There are new chapters on credit risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. It covers integrated risk management and the risk management profession. The actual material on VAR has changed little from the first edition."
2,PR for VaR,"I began using this book as part of my audit job at a major trading/investment firm. I'm currently an FRM candidate, and this is the FRM-recommended book for a bulk of readings on VaR methods and implementation. The first few chapters are a general survey of the risk management world, and informative by themselves. Unfortunately, that's where it stops. As the book starts to dive deeper into VaR, the ideas quickly become disjointed, incoherent and difficult to follow - I have a mathematical background, but it is very frustrating to have to read repeatedly to try and decipher entire sections of the book, especially the whole chapter on backtesting. While VaR as a concept is easy to grasp, the devil is very largely in the details, which this book fails to present in any organized way. So, it is more like an advertisement for the idea of VaR-based risk management, but certainly not a practical guide."
2,not helpfull at all!,I believe that this book is not at all helpfull since it does not explain thouroughly the material. It just provides the reader with tables and calculations that sometimes are not easily understood. Moreover it refers to important material such as the calculation of VAR in SWAPS and FRAs without really explaining!!!
1,Didn't work at all,"I bought this replacement battery and it says it's an exact match, but it either never charged or never powered my camera, I can't tell for sure which. Totally useless."
1,Save your money,Not helpful can glean same and more from the excel help files. Save yr money use the help files or another book with more thought given to a college level course.
5,Super Excel Book!,This book is filled with great examples and practical applications of Excel software to accounting.
4,great for bithday parties!,I bought these for my daughter's 6th birthday party. I put them on a table and let all 36 kids make a bookmark to take home. It was such a hit with all of the kids & their parents! There are 3 bookmarks in each package. Wooden bookmarks they can decorate themselves.
1,Inhumane!,This is the most inhumane and disgusting item that I have seen in ages. Once the animal is caught it cannot move and if it struggles it gets even more caught up in the glue. Our neighbor caught a bird in theirs and as we tried to free it the birds got both wings and its tail caught in the glue and was literally crying! It turns my stomach to even remember the scene long enough to write about it. The man who set out the trap is gone for several days and any animal caught would have been left to suffer that whole time.
2,Crystal Lewis is better later.,"Crystal can be good, and can be boring. I don't like all of Crystal's CDs... or all of her songs. The 3 best albums she does are ""Fearless,"" ""Crystal Lewis holiday"" and ""More"". I haven't heard this one yet, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Crystal tends to be a little bit boring on her earlier records and she didn't get a real firm style until ""Fearless"". I have never heard of ""Bride"" by Crystal Lewis besides on Amazon.com. Most of her older albums are scarce now. Let's just hope she keeps getting better... and better... and better..."
3,BAK Retractable Bed Cover,"I've had this cover for about a year and a half. It is not totally water tight but pretty good. The paint is coming off of it, bubbling up here and there. VERY ANNOYING. If you want to haul a 4-wheeler in the bed, and be able to shut the tailgate, do not buy this as the retractable storage box takes up a large amount of room. When you install it there is a large gap on the front, right behind the cab, between the cover and the bed box. I had to go buy some self stick foam insulation strips to put in between before completing installation. I DO like the fact that since I have an auto locking tailgate that I can put whatever I want in the bed and feel like it is in a secure place."
3,"Works OK, Not great","I am on a very old ATT phone line and my other modem kept dropping the line, read good reviews on this one and it does not drop the line as often, but connects at a slower speed. Was going to send it back, but decided it was better to stay connected at any speed, 21,6 than be in the middle of a pogo game and the line to drop. I called USR and they were not any help in getting a higher connect speed. It also takes a long time to get connected in the first place. ATT does not offer DSL in my area, they had rather spend their money buying other phone companies than take care of the customers they already have."
4,Works and was inexpensive,It's not fancy but for a coat closet it does the job just fine. Could have spent lots more but wouldn't have gotten any more usefulness.
3,Greatest hits lp is the TAB....25,"Just wanted to mention in reference to the review below: The God Says No album was kind of off because the master tapes were swiped and the band had to start from scratch again, so as a 'quickie-demo-sketchpad' album, damn fine, but yes, not their best. Monolithic had some nice meaty riffs, but its hard to keep a band going after 10 years, tours, albums, etc. MM is one of my faves, especially for keeping the torch of sludge-metal alive since the early 90s when such a style was against the grundge grain. Interested fans should check out current Doom Metal bands such as Electric Wizard, Organe Goblin, High on Fire, Sleep, and its worth the time travel trip to check out Hawkwind, a direct influence on MM. Hawkwind also is significant for being the band Lemmy was in right before good old who know who.Here's feedback in your ear."
4,good not great,"This a good compilation with the videos,it came out at the same time as Rob Zombies Greatest hits which came with a dvd of videos why are these videos on cdrom isn't that a bit passe now why weren't these clips put on dvd or vcd format."
3,"Some good features, some disappointing.","Good range and works well as an AP or AP client. On the other hand, the advertised WDS mode does not work, so if you are buying to string together multiple AP's, don't bother."
1,DWL-7100 AP as an AP Client is terrible,"I'm not sure how the 7100 is supposed to work as a repeater but as an AP Client linked with the DI-784 it simply won't stay connected. I'm running the latest firmware on both devices,DWL-7100ap is running v2.00 and teh DI-784 is running v2.38. I've tried multiple configs for the encryption, different radio channels while the 2 devices are only sitting 2ft apart and it still won't keep a connection.Tech support isn't helpful either, long hold times and operators that don't actually listen to the problem.I can't reccomend this product, I think one star is still too many stars."
1,D_Link AP Review.,"I purchased this D_link access point with the intention of using it in my home. Much to my surprise it did not come with a power supply. I though well I guess I missed it in the discription, it must have said without power supply. Well it does NOT say without power supply but I guess it does not say With power supply. But to me that is like going to pick up you new car and finding out it does not have tires on it, hmmmmm, well I guess the bill of sale for the car did not say anything about it having tires! So watchout who you buy from, I feel like I have been taken a bit on this one."
5,Excellent disc..magnificent performance.,"Gunilla von Bahr and Diego Blanco are two legendary Swedish label BIS artists who give us various written works of Scandinavian origin for these beautiful musical instruments such as the flute and classical guitar. Beautiful work of Eberhard Werdin where the instruments mentioned are brilliantly accompanied by the Stockholm Chamber Ensemble.Also include the Sonatina for flute and guitar of Castelnuovo-Tedesco, work of interesting virtuosity and the Sonata for flute and guitar of Einojuhani Rautavaara, intense and beautiful.Two artist with beautiful sound and fine interpretation."
3,Waterproof but poor reception,"As the title suggests this phone is terrific aound the pool. It has been completely submerged several times and still works as well as it did the day I got it. That is not, however, a good thing. I find the reception poor - even at a range of 5-15 feet unobstructed. It definately does not compare to the newer phones with better technology. I understand that panasonic has a new waterproof phone. I may give that a try and leave this phone for my kids to use."
2,Wishful thinking,"I actually bought this phone a year ago and returned it. The range was poor and it had a buzz in the background. I saw it in the store again and was hoping it was a newer model. Not sure if it is, but it has the same problems. I will return it again. Too bad, I need a phone for the hot tub.UPDATE. I called Uniden about the buzz. They are aware of the problem. 2 options. They will replace with a non waterproof phone or they will try to repair the phone, but said the buzz may come back. They don't have a waterproof replacement. Back to the store it goes."
2,"Tough phone, with poor sound quality and poor range.","Just got one of these in the hope that it will survive my three kids, they go through phones pretty quick. This seems to be a very rugged phone, so should last a while. Unfortunately the sound quality is poor and the range is just barely able to cover our small house."
1,lousy phone,Surprisingly poor quality for a Uniden phone. Volume is very low -- hard to hear caller. Don't waste your money.
3,Not bad for the price,"The reception isnt too bad. I did notice a hummung noise when I'm talking to someone but, when the earpeice volume is at its lowest setting I can barely notice it. The moment it was done charging I took it out to my pool and threw it in. Yes it did float and it still worked after being submerged under water. I have to hand it to Uniden the water resistance deffinately works well. My 2 complaints are when on the charging base it generates a bit of heat. So when you pick up the phone it is warm to the touch & the other is there is a humming noise when you are talking to someone (could be in the sensitivity of the microphone set to high picking up all noise around the handset). If uniden would fix that issue I would have given it 5 stars. Over all I am satisfied with my purchase. If you need a pool phone that can take the water abuse and still work this is something you should consider."
1,Dead on Arrival,"I ordered the Uniden WXI 377 submersible cordless phone (refurbished) to use with my Magic Jack mostly for travel. It is a great looking phone in addition to being water resistant, rugged and reasonably priced. I read the manual, activated the handset and charged the unit for 24 hours, attached the phone line and nothing. Absolutely nothing. I did get a red light indicating that the battery was charging and could feel that the battery compartment was a little warm, but no dial tone, no illuminated screen and nothing but disappointment. I will return this one and get a replacement with high hopes that the new one will at least operate. I did not expect much for under $20, but I did expect it to at least work."
1,Poor quality!,"Please do not waste your time with this one. I purchased this phone to use by the pool and was disappointed to find I could not get any reception more than 30ft from the base. What is the point of having a ""waterproof"" phone if it cannot be used outside? Also, when I was able to receive/make calls, the reception quality was very poor. This phone, although a great idea, is now sitting in the closet collecting dust. I wonder if it's dust proof too?"
3,Uniden Submersible Cordless Phone,"We love the fact that it can be used out by our pooland we don't have to worry about it getting splashedWe had to send the first one back, it didn't work, but Amazonwas wonderful, issued a call tag for it, and promptly sent thereplacement..The phone is not as clear as we had hoped for, has a slightbuzzing noise we can hear while speaking, but perhaps it is our phone line itself, not sureOverall though, am happy with the phoneThanks"
4,Uniden submersible phone,"i bought it and i am glad. i read several bad reviews but more good reviews. as was said several times, there is a slight back ground hum. other than that, the phone is perfect. my hand actually enjoys holding the unit!"
2,Great First Impression,"It served its purpose well for a few months, then the green traction material began 'shedding', clogging my filter, and now the strips are coming off the plastic completely."
1,its just OK.,"I bought this ramp a few months ago and my two RES have been loving it up until the green tape started to lose its non skid magic. RES turtles bodies grow very often as well as their claws and the more and more they climb up the ramp to bask the more the tape's non skid material fades. Now after 3 months my RES struggle to bask, I have to help them up. Now I have to find safe non skid tape for the turtle ramp as a replacement or completely throw away the ramp and buy another one (which by the way its not exactly cheap to constantly buy the same ramp every few months, the $$$ adds up after a while.) Its a disappointment to know that an item works only for such a short while."
3,Exactly as promised but my turtles won't use it.,"It's an ingenious design and fit snugly and securely in my 90 gallon tank, however my 10-inch female and 5-inch male Red-Eared Slider turtles wouldn't use it. I surported their well enough, although bent a bit under the big turtle's weight. That fact, mixed with the fact that it's clear is why I believe my turtles wouldn't trust it. I'm no longer using it."
5,Turtle Ramp,My turtle absolutely loves this ramp. Since day 1 that I put it in he went right up and basked on it. It's very sturdy and well made. He enjoys that he can reposition himself up there without falling into the water like he did on previous ramps and docks I had purchased. When he goes to sleep he sleeps on the lower part of the ramp that is under water with his face sticking out of the water. I couldn't even imagine going back to any other type of dock again after having purchased this one.
4,Only dock large enough but doesn't last,"This is the only turtle dock I can find that is large enough for my two yellow bellied sliders. It stays put for the most part. My only problem is that this is that second one purchased in less than a year because the strips have peeled off, it began turning black with mold (we clean the tank and accessories weekly) and it started turning the water green."
4,Turtle Ramp,"This ramp worked fairly well, but because my turtles are on the larger side, the ramp would actually start to bend downward when they would bask on it. It would be nice if this came in a larger size where the ramps were wider and able to sustain heavier turtles."
4,My Franklin is happier with this turle dock,"I highly recommend this product. I wasn't sure if the size was appropriate but the ""large"" one fits pretty nice in my 40 breeder aquarium. He has plenty of resting room. I doubt it if he uses the diving board part. He has picked up a little weight and isn't able to climb up on docks anymore. As a matter of fact, walking on dry land is a struggle for him. So, he can easily swim and rest on this Kordon-Oasis Novalek Turtle Ramp. He is able to pull his body up from under the water using this one. I was concerned about him not being able to bask as much as he loves too. His limbs under his legs are puffy so that prevents him from moving as much. I pray this is normal. I love my Franklin.He hated the soft foam turtle dock and he also hated the turtle dock that sits on top of the tank. it's not even nice looking.So far this Novalek has been the winner of all docks!!! So, glad I purchased it."
2,"Had one previous, new quality is lower","Had one of these ramps for almost three years, till all the grip finally wore off it from all the climbing. Figured I'd buy a the same one and expected good things. Less than a month in, there is no more grip on the tape and makes it hard to climb up. Was expecting better quality since the first one was better."
4,Don't bogart that roach...,"A previous owner of this copy of ""Budding Prospects"" wrote on the front page: ""Beautiful writing style devoted to thoroughly immature, immoral subject matter. What could be more perfect?"" I would have to agree with this sentiment. I thought this novel, Boyle's second, was extremely funny and one of his best. Very intelligent writing with some great characters and lots of humor. The story of 3 misfits trying to make a half million bucks by growing pot in the hills of Mendocino California, is not exactly what I thought it would be - it was much better. Boyle's stories never seem to disappoint."
3,Boyle's done better,"This book got me all excited, especially after ""Water Music"" and ""World's End.""But ""Bud"" is a bit flat, and lacks any coherent message. It's cute, even funny in places -- a snack, not a meal.""Budding Prospects"" will leave Boyle fans, I believe, with the munchies."
3,his tighest book,"I've read a lot of Boyle's works, and I think all in all this is his best. I feel that his other works -- and this one to a degree -- start out great but ultimately disappoint. His books start out sharp, funny (very, very funny) and full of energy. But by the last third of his books the energy leaves and the chapters become depressing and repetitive. This happens in Budding Prospects, but to a lesser degree than in Water Music or Worlds End. However, the subject matter here isn't as weighty as those two. All in all, this is a delight to read; his use of the english language at times is genius. If you are interested in TC this would be the book to start with."
2,Not as much fun as you may be lead to believe....,"I first read this about 10 years ago and enjoyed it. However, in revisiting it, I have found reading it to be a chore. For a novel that's supposed to be fun, there are a couple of major problems with it. The main character, Felix Nasmyth, is a rather self-absorbed, humorless and generally unlikable jerk. I found myself totally unable to sympathize with him. Also, there's such a pervasive sense of dread overshadowing the proceedings that it makes it hard to take as being very funny or enjoyable. Lastly, as another review mentioned, the book is way, way overshot with metaphor and entirely too showy. I am by and large a fan of Boyle's work, but he was trying way too hard here to prove how clever he can be, and as a result most of this comes off as overwrought. If I were to recommend reading something by Boyle to anyone, it would not be this. Go with World's End or Riven Rock first."
2,Metaphorical overkill,"This book was recommended by several friends of mine telling it was fun to read. After having rested on my shelves for quite some time I recently decided to give it a try. Although I read it through within a couple of days I have strong objections to recommend it to others. First of all, I soon started getting annoyed by the narrator's promiscuous use of metaphors and comparisons. There are far too many of them and they often seem to be inappropiate. Even if you consider that Felix has been a slacker student of English literature it feels like polishing a weak story with a 'literary touch'. Additionally, the characters are flat and after the first part it becomes clear that their 'American Dream' project will turn into a worst-case scenario."
5,100% PURE ENTERTAINMENT!,"A wonderful, quick read. T.C. Boyle's style reflects that of the whimsical, descriptive and casual ways of Hunter S. Thompson, yet with a unique flavor of its own. The characters are very well-developed; written as an imperfect, yet sympathetic (and, no matter how much one may want to deny it, EMpathetic) bunch. The story is extremely engaging, the action consistant, the humor non-stop. It is, perhaps, the best contemporary fiction I have read in ages. I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone looking for a little pick-me-up at the end of a stressful day."
4,Little Giante Utility Pump,"Purchased to keep rainwater from accumulating on the winter cover of our new pool. It has worked flawlessly. Beiing able to place it and not worry about being there to unplug it, is a very nice feature. The auto on and off level switch has worked."
4,be careful,"I just got my two new Little Giants, one for manual operation and one for automatic operation. I get groundwater that threatens coming into my house when it gets to be a few inches deep. I purchased this automatic pump/switch combo because the info on the Little Giant manufacturer's site makes it look like it will pump down to 3/8 inches or so--NOT TRUE!!! With the auto switch on it won't kick in at all until the water is 3-5 inches deep. Be forewarned based on your specific needs. When in manual modes the pumps work great, spilling a 3/4"" garden hose-sized stream of water that shoots out 2 feet or more.Terry GundlachNewport Beach, CA"
2,Bee Gees Forever,I am a great fan of the bee gees since the 70's this was a great price for the product just not really fond of the songs. I like the older stuff better
4,ONE MORE FOR THE BROTHERS,"THE BEE GEES have certainly tried to change with the times and after their phenomenal disco success, they jumped into the 90s with ONE.Allegedly a musical catharsis to the tragic death of youngest brother Andy, the Gibbs adopted a heavier rock approach with more personal lyrics. ONE was the biggest hit here in the US and features their trademark harmonies and mastery of hookable melodies. YOU WIN AGAIN gained moderate success and is a jubilant anthemic offering. BODYGUARD is an elegant, lush ballad reminiscent of their earliest love songs like CHARADE.I've always been a fan of the Bee Gees and admired their tenacity and staying power. ONE is a good addition to their legacy"
5,My All Time Favorite Bee Gees album,"The title track of this album is worth the price alone. ""One"" has a groove that just won't quit, and the harmonies....well, that's their trademark. The production is consistent throughout, and Maurice and Robin turn in some great lead vocals as well. This could be the best Bee Gees album ever made...."
5,On the go gourmets try this book!,"My wife and I recently purchased this book with the hopes of being able to plan ahead for the week with a gourmet twist. This book has exceeded our expectations in every way possible. The meals are not only fun to prepare, but have gotten rave reviews with everyone we have shared them with. The book contains a broad selection of menus with varied meats as the theme. This versatility has really kept us trying each set of meals. We have currently tried the first two weeks and are excited about the remaining eleven. The chocolate cheesecake for week one is outstanding. If you like cheesecake, this recipe alone is worth the price of the book. The pepper crusted tuna with grilled asparagus and grilled potatoes will keep you coming back for more. If you are a person who enjoys cooking good food, but also enjoys a very busy and active life, then this book is for you. Enjoy and bon apetite."
4,Some great guitar,"Here's what I can tell you. 35 years ago I had a Tolonen compilation, ""Crossection"" (1975) that had Windermere Avenue and Silva the Cat on it. I remember only those two cuts, which were my favorites, and they're on this 1974 CD. Windermere Avenue has one of the most melodic, beautiful solos I have ever heard--I haven't had the album for decades, but I can hear the whole thing right now. Soaring. I've heard my share. True, it's pricey for one solo (not that that's likely to be the only good material on the album--Tolonen is a heck of a great guitarist) but I'm telling you, it's no ordinary solo. If you're a guitar lover...."
4,A Fine Sampler,"Another gem of the Oxford World's Classics series, Crossley-Holland's anthology presents a generous selection of poetry and prose covering the major genres of Anglo Saxon Lit. All the famous stuff is here -- Seafarer, Wanderer, Battle of Maldon,etc -- including a very fine Beowulf translation that's highly readable without straying far from the literal meaning of the original. Plus riddles, laws, sections of the Chronicle -- quite enough to get a rounded picture of this fascinating literature, and all well translated. The scholarly notes are sparse but adequate for an intro-level text. If I could make one suggestion for improvement, it would be to add the Anglo-Saxon versions in a bilingual edition, so readers could have the sound and structure of the originals."
4,Great starting off point for new bank board members,"Benton Gup gives a very thorough overview of the role of a bank board member and the importance of understanding the major elements that make up a modern financial institution.It is important to note that this is a starter book; if you are currently a bank board member, or contemplating becoming one, you should understand that this book will spur you to further study on major subjects in other books and formats."
3,Good entertainment,"A desperate escape from Romania after the fall of the Ceasescus. So begins a dangerous quest for Paul Cartwright, a young English mining engineer at the port of Constanza. He is forced to escape by way of the Danube Delta in the company of a strange young woman who claims to be Vikki's sister - known as the Little Sultana whom Cartwright encountered years ago dancing alone in front of a mesmerised restaurant audience.Is Vikki really the daughter of a sultan on the borders of Afghanistan? What is hidden wealth in her realm that now draws the Russian mafia into the search? Suspense dogs Cartwright's progress across the Khyber Pass up into the lost vastnesses of the Pamirs. Although the search for Vikki seems suicidal, somewhere in those towering mountains of Afghanistan lies the clue to the whole mystery."
4,Perfect Blue is wicked,"Being that I lived in Tokyo for three years, I was blown away by the authenticity of the background in scences of Perfect Blue. The story itself shows the psychological collapse of a young and beautiful Japanese woman, Mima, on the rise to pop and acting stardom. This descent into madness is brought on by a super-creepy stalker, a taunting alter-ego, and the fact that everyone connected to her is being brutally murdered.With a haunting score, frightening images, shocking violence, and superb animation, Perfect Blue socks you in the stomach and demands that you view it multiple times. Definitely not for anyone under 17."
4,This is definitely as advertised,"If you're in the mood for an anime with nail-biting suspense and a touch or horror, then Perfect Blue is definitely for you. The story plays out well, the setting fits, and the characters all act like real people. And it is certainly creepy! I saw it late at night with my best friend, and it succeeded in making me lie awake far into the night. I'd reccommend this to anyone who loves a good thriller."
5,"Perfect, Perfect Blue.",This is an amazing animated feature about a pop star who wants to become an actress. On her road to becoming an actress she does some things that compromises her morals. Satoshi Kon is an amazing story teller that puts alot of effort into his work. He has a way of telling stories that will leave you guessing to the end. I bought this because of Paprika which came much later than this. Although it is much older than Paprika it is just as good and I really enjoyed it.
4,Perfect Blue,This is a very good example of true mature story telling in anime form. Almost as if they had chaneled the spirit of the late great Alfred Hitchcock. Anime doesn't get much better.
4,Amazing anime!,"This movie is screwed up. It starts out with a simple enough plot, pop star and stalker, and then it pulls multiple 180o turns and twists until you wonder what exactly is going on. Even when the film ends I was left with a feeling that I was missing something, due to the last line in the movie.I can only give this 4 stars because the special features section locks up my DVD player sometimes. :(If you love anime, and you've been looking for one that is not only devoid of sci-fi/fantasy elements, but also backed by a good story and brilliant voice acting this is the one my friends."
4,Joy to watch,"For numerous reasons I really enjoyed this movie. The plot drags you in and hooks you. A psychological thriller a la Hitchcock. If you want a movie that makes you think, consider buying this one!"
3,Great film - terrible dub,"I saw this film in theaters about 2 months ago, and it was awesome! It is one of the best anime's I have ever seen: the animation is wonderful and chilling, the characters are very well developed, and the music is brilliant... but the dub is TERRIBLE! It sounds like the voice actors read & recorded the script without even practicing once. Some of the scenes you can just tell would be so awesome in the original Japanese... so buy the film, just buy it subbed! Sure it's a bit more expensive but it's worth it. Plus, they actually HAVE it subbed on amazon, which is pretty rare coz I've looked all over the net for a subbed copy and this is the only place that has it."
2,"Try again, Manga.","This is the UMD version of Perfect Blue (I have no idea why Amazon has it listed in such an oblique fashion.) Anyway--look, Manga, I appreciate you releasing stuff like this in the UMD format. But it's absolutely unforgivable to release a prominent anime film with an English dub only. There's no technical reason to do it this way. We know from your Perfect Blue DVD release that you have access to both tracks. Even the copy of freaking Godzilla: Final Wars I have on UMD has both Japanese and English tracks. Why do it this way? I don't get it. Anyway, avoid unless you're unbothered by sterile English dubs."
4,"really great, really really great","perfect blue is awesome. you reallly get in mimas head. you get as confused as she is. what still bothers me is that i cant understand everythin yet. its that difficult.and about the sex and violence parts, i think they are justified and that hollywood is afraid of all these things. we have to see another contries films to see something a bit honest."
3,Over-hyped,"Despite what some reviewers say, the storyline is pretty predictable. Even worse, the main character is never fleshed out enough to make her psycho-drama truly compelling.On the plus side, the animation is interesting, offering some realistic scenes of Akihabara, Shinjuku, and other Tokyo neighborhoods.But for those who put this film in the same league as 'Princess Mononoke', 'Lain', 'Ghost in the Shell', 'Akira', or even 'Jin Roh'....well,I'd have to strongly disagree.Worth renting, but not buying."
1,I'VE SEEN BETTER FILM ON TEETH!,"The only way that this flick would/could possibly be all that is said about it is if I was a 10-to-12 year old mormon girl! After all the killer reviews that I've read about thiI was so excited to see this flick after searching for it for months, I finally gave up and just bought it (used thankfully. When it arrived, I noticed upon inspection that the DVD's paper sleeve that wraps the case and the inner flyer looked like they had been pulled out and crumpled up into a ball an thrown in the trash...then taken out and re-flattened when the bright idea of selling the piece of crap dawned on the orginal owner. This movie puts the ucks in sucks...AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. Trust me its not even a one star flick.Get Ninga Scroll instead!"
2,Not so great ...,"I'm a big fan for Japanese anime, but I find this a bit ""disgusting"" at the certain parts. Maybe, female audience will agree with me in this, the movie is a bit perveted. There was a scene where people were shooting how woman is raped, then some provactive pictures of how she sort of touched herself. In some ""real"" movies, sexual scene were shot artistically or erotically. But, this movie just failed that."
1,Perfect Blue was Perfectly Bad,"I saw Perfect Blue in a theatre, and it's the worst anime I've ever seen! My two friends and I only stayed for the whole thing because we got in for free. I had heard so many good things about it, but the animation and story were both lacking, and the main character was horribly annoying! The never-engding giggling drove us all mad. I was so dissapointed; spare yourself from the same and go see something good, like Princess Mononoke or X."
1,Wow this movie .... don't waste your money.,"Have you ever noticed that all the movies reviews by Amazon have high ratings? .... It dealt with mature contect in an imature fashion. Kids can't watch this because it is not appropriate material, adults can't watch it because the plot and screaming and crying are to juvenile to enjoy, please don't waste your money..... stick to Ghost in a shell or Vampire Hunter D. I will bet you for every 10 people who actually purchase this movie only the least discerning of quality will actually enjoy. Basically if you like everthing you will like this, if you have some critical thinking capability you will hate it."
1,Perfect Confusion,"Well, if this is considered one of the best - I'm very disappointed. Poor animation with little attention to detail - this anime looked decades older than ""Akira."" Hardly terrifying and I guess I became paranoid just watching the story creep along with little action. ""Excuse Me...Is this good Anime?""So I only give a single star based on the catchy tune by Cham.This is one Manga video that is headed out the door."
1,perfect blue,"this anime film was stale, bland and uninteresting. I fell asleep two times while watching before I finally completed with my final analsys. the characters were dull and obtrusive, the sound was nothing to get excited about. and as for the plot, i will stick to hitchcock's brillant masterpieces over this tripe. harsh but true."
5,Thought provoking,"I cant say much that hasnt already been said about this fine piece of cinema but I will say that Perfect Blue has made an impression on me. Something about the style and delivery of this anime that isnt at all like anime grabbed me and left it's mark. Definitely recommended viewing for folks who like psychological thrillers, and especially fans of more real-life anime."
4,good but,"don't be fooled by the title, this is a straight forward thriler with the usual nudity found in almost al the japsnese animation its about a stalker whno flows a teenage pop star and gets mad when she changes careers to become anctress and stop singing you might to check this title out if you like these kinds of storys.if not it's still worth checking it out but i don't think you would want to watch it a secind time."
4,A haunting mind trip,"This movie is haunting in it's pacing and imagery. At points aswe see Japan, we forget that we are watching animation and imagine weare watching a film. At points that is. There is also some rough roughanimation that detracts. But the story, the characters, the pacing all works, and you get drawn in. And ... you get those Cham songs stuck in your head, I warn you now!Also there is some great supplemental information about the cast, directors and the company that released it. This is a special movie and MANGA obviously agreed, because they gave it a great support package."
3,A departure from the norm of anime,Having recently watched Perfect blue I have found that the critics were partly right in saying that if Hitchcock made a film with Disney it would turn out like this.The film centres on a former pop idol turned actress who begins to think that she is losing her mind. The plot is very diverse in that it tries to show how stardom can deeply affect the mental state of the person in the spotlight. It entertains well with a strange mix of brutal violence and quiet reflection. It's downfall comes from the fact that it's plot does have some holes that are noticible when you finish watching the film. It is still a recommended purchase as it is different to most of the manga releases that are high on violence but low on plot.
4,"Excuse me, who are you? Excuse me, who are you?","Satoshi Kon did an amazing job on this one. Me, being a fan of Paranoia Agent, and Tokyo Godfathers - I appreciate almost all of his animated films. It wasn't as good as Tokyo Godfathers however this isn't a place for comparison. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good old fashioned mind bending thriller. With a little bit of a psychotic identity crisis and an unforeseen twist of an ending."
5,Creepy,"Perfect Blue has got to be the most thrilling and disturbing anime out there. It tells a story of celebrity obsession gone wrong. The story is twisted, the animation is dark and the voice acting fits the characters perfectly. Perfect Blue is a must have in any anime fan's collection."
5,Non-Stop Pulse Pounding Suspense/Thriller,"This movie was top notch. All i have to say about Perfect Blue is nothing short of Fantastic. The animation was brilliant, the characters were likable, And the plot moves along like a waterfall. You should definetly keep this movie from the kiddies. This movie is violent, disturbing, and stylish all at the same time. The film is set around a pop singer Mima Kirigoe who wants to quite her singing career, and become an astounding actress. Yet not all is as it seems, when she starts to hallucinate, and her friends and colleags start to die by an unexpected stalker. Like I said before this movie is nothing short of fantastic. Please for your own good go buy it."
2,Not really an typical anime..more like a Lifetime cartoon,"The ads for this film always stuck in the word ""Hitchcockian""; I disagree. Yes, it is somewhat suspensful, and yes there were a few thrills, but moreover, the emotional state of the main character is shoved in the viewer's face in such a whiney way that it's annoying. There's an creepy stalker, mental breakdown, and a walkthrough of the main gal's life. But honestly, in the end, this movie turns out to be nothing more than a Lifetime Orginial in cartoon form."
5,Blue movies...,"This is one of my favorite, if not my favorite anime movie of all time. It is a well-done and well-thought-out movie and done exquisitely. The closest thing I can compare it to in American cinema is Blue Velvet. The whole movie has a very David Lynch-esque feel to it, and that just adds to the movie. If you like thinking movies, like anime, or like David Lynch, this is well worth the purchase."
3,"Well worth watching, but not amazing.","Perfect Blue is worth watching, but it doesn't have many of the features that anime fans have come to expect, like magic, advanced technology, sex, monsters or fight scenes - and as a result, those fans might be disappointed. People keep calling it a psychological thriller. It's psychological, and it has some neat ""the main character is losing her mind"" things in it, but it is a tad less than thrilling, I'm afraid. Really, it is a decent movie, but aside from being animated, it doesn't have much else to do with anime. My advice - check it out, but don't expect a Ghost in the Shell, Vampire Hunter D or Ninja Scroll, because it ain't like that."
4,Good movie but could deal w/out a couple of scenes,"I really like thrillers, espically psychological ones. I have never really been into the whole anima until I watched Ghost in the Shell. Very good movie but totally opposite from this. Perfect Blue deals with a pop-singer, turning into an actress. There were a couple of scenes in which I thougth they could have left out. But this movie had me hooked and guessing till the very end. I would recommend this."
3,unPerfect Blue,"an admirable attempt but hardly Hitchcockian. i don't know if it's because something was lost in the translation from japanese to english or that the director tried so hard not to be outguessed by the audience that logical progression did not, well, progress. the story just didn't flow. instead of the ""aha! no wonder... amazing!"" what i got was ""what the ...! that's it!"" although i'm disappointed i still would recommend that you see this film. maybe you could tell me about the things that i missed."
3,Perfect????? Blue,"Well, where should i start. If you like your animes to challenge you to actually pay attention, buy this one. I couldnt follow what i was watching the first time i watched this movie. However, everything fell into place when i saw it a second time the night after my first viewing. The second time made everything i missed or not understood fall into the spots that they needed to be. To confusing???? If you watch this movie without paying attention, you may find yourself in a confused state of mind afterward. I walked away from my viewing dazed and confused. I give it 3 stars for huge suspense, and unpredictability i have not seen till this movie......i also give it three stars for poor if average animation, and one confusing story plot."
3,More twists than a twizzler in a whirlpool,"I feel like I'm going to thow up after watching this movie. Near the end (the last 20 minutes or so) the plot undergoes about 40 twists. Each completely different from the others. Now if you like that kinda thing... then get the movie. But as for me, I perfer my plot twists to happen at least 10 minutes apart.When the movie ended I wasn't sure it had. It was a unique feeling, but not worth the mental stress I had to endure to get to that point. I'll stick to my gratuitous blood and gore for a while, there's enough storyline here for a dozen movies."
5,if only there were more stars to give...,"This was my introduction to anime. And what a great start. Animation wasn't hard on the eyes like some and the dubbing was good. at first, it could be just some movie about a pop idol. When she decides to become an actress and lands her first roll in a Law & Order: Special Victims Unit-style drama, she is thrown into a world of madness. A fan, angered by her choice to become an actress, begins stalking her and her mental state slowly deteriorates until at the end of the movie, she can't tell what's real or not. It's very well done. When she loses her mind, it's hard for the viewer to tell what's real or not along with her. It even has a awesome chase scene, and the plot twist at the end came out of nowhere - it will surprise anyone. I recommend you stop reading this review and go out right now to buy it. Definately one you'll watch more than once."
5,Worth seeing,"A dark story with psychological twist in it. Well done for an anime, but not for children. Adult themes and violence. Enjoyed the movie, it constantly makes you evaluate if the main character is in reality or fantasy."
4,Compelling and interesting anime.,"Friday, February 25, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Compelling and interesting anime.What an interesting surprise this anime was. As a member of a pop idol trio leaves and strives to become a serious actress, she slowly begins to lose touch with reality. Questions of identity abound as she imagines her old pop idol persona has peeled away from her and is acting independent of her. Murders begin to occur and the viewer is left to wonder who is committing them from her alter ego to debased fans and other unknown entities. The final twist was very well done and in hind sight makes a lot of sense, but you won't see it coming. Straddling the line between light hearted and heavy drama it's a strangely compelling anime story."
4,Suspense and storytelling more in a Western manner,"The rather disturbing Japanese concept of female purity and sexuality in this anime may put off some viewers a bit, but it's more than compensated by the well-rounded central character, consistent pace and cohesive plot. Very telling that this was based on a novel and not a manga, which can rilly wander in their thousands of pages of story development. If you must have the dubbed version, do pay attention to the TV's bizarre ""newscast"" story early on, about the woman, the baby and the shopping cart."
3,A So-So movie...,"If you're into psycho-thriller animes, I'd suggest Kite more than this. But it's your money.."
5,Satoshi Kon Hits Big w/ This Thriller Classic,"This movie was a real treat that gives the viewer(s) a big of mystery and suspense. Mima, the main character, is a J-pop singer who leaves her trio to persue an acting career. However, one fan just won't let her go, and it becomes somewhat of a stalking movie at the beginning. Mysterious deaths occur around the city and some of the people impacting Mima's life the most end up dead (her manager, the director of her new TV show, etc.). This classic is the Alfred Hitchcock of anime - it can't be beat and it leaves those who watch it at the end with a big question - was it all a dream in, or did it really happen? This movie plays with twists and turns that put roller coaster rides to shame, and it does so in such an art form that makes it a big hit with any fan of anime murder thrillers (a rare breed indeed)."
5,kawaii,"I love this anime! It shows he transformation in the star's life between kawaii (cute, innocent . . .) pop star to the woman actor she becomes in the end. The viewer follows the moral dillemas the girl is having throughout these changes, and sees the world from the star's point of view. The film is disturbing at parts, but that aspect makes it all the more powerful. It is amazingly strange."
2,What?,"This is a psychological thriller title that starts out strong, but unfortunately turns sour during the last 30 minutes. Movies with major plot twists can be great(sixth sense), but in this case, the dubbing job is so poorly done, it causes nothing but confusion. The english words they dubbed in must be completely wrong, because it started to make no sense whatsoever. It's fairly entertaining, but the end will leave you wondering ""what's going on?"". Watch only if you're very bored, or a major anime fan."
4,I have no idea what the other reviewer is complaining about!,"I have no idea what you are complaining about! This movie is perfect, and the voice dubbing is wonderful. Remember, the dubbing of Japanese voice-over is terrible, and Americans are the 'movie-makers' not the other way around. Leave the Japanese Videogames to the Japanese, and American movies and production to us Americans.I thought the overall production of this movie was fantastic! 4 stars only because no special features. But overall, very good!"
3,Not My Cup of Tea,"I saw this last night, and I'm still not sure if I would recommend it to anyone.The ending, like one reviewer mentioned, is too simple, too clean. Also, why didn't Rumi die..it seems she should have, in classic ""bunny-boiler who wants what her adversary has"" fashion.The rape scene was too much for me, too: the costume Mima was wearing looked too much like her pop idol threads, and the action seemed too much for usual anime. Hentai indeed!Nope, I would definitely stay away from this one of you are just starting out as an anime fan."
2,I've seen better anime,"When I saw the preview of this movie, i was grabbed by the ""original"" plot. Although, it was a huge disappointment when I saw ""Perfect Blue"". I found it, a bad image for all women out there. The only reason that I truely got this was that it was based on a book. So, If it's based on a book then it must be good right?As a HUGE anime fan, I was truely bummed. I have seen the kind of anime where a lot of people would recommend,such as Ghost in the Shell,Lain,Princess Mononoke and others. But If I were to recommend a anime to someone, ""Perfect Blue"" would be at the bottom of my list."
3,Primarily for younger people,"As a ""senior citizen"" I was disappointed that little in this book was directed to those of us who can no longer hike for miles in the mountains. I wish there had been more attention devoted to those of us with limited endurance."
4,Last CD with old guitarist and drummer,"This ep is Ignite's last record with their old guitarist (Joe Foster) and drummer. Foster's riffs are very recognizeable.In comparison with their newer records (A place called home and Our darkest days) this is way more of a 90s hardcore record than the more 'rock' sound they have today. I believe they will not be reprinted again so if you want one, be quick :)I like the speed of the songs (pretty fast) and Zoli's vocals so this ep is a winner. Enjoy!"
5,"The lyrics are awesome and priceless, a must for all!","The lyrics are awesome and priceless, a must for all! You must have the whole collection!!!"
2,Don't expect to use this controller for more than 10 months,"I purchased three of these controllers along with my GC, & all three failed at around 9 months. They seem to be fairly susceptible to high-humidity as I took a couple of them apart & found that the screws holding it together & various parts inside the units were corroded.The standard Nintendo branded controllers are vastly superior in every respect. Spend an extra $5 and get one of those."
1,Wrong book,"Unfortunately, the wrong book was sent to me and the one ordered was no longer available.... However, I was given a full refund including the shipping cost and told to keep the book sent by error."
2,A review,"This book is shallow and poorly researched with a paucity of sources, few names, dates or places of occurrence related to the subject matter.The author allows his Judeo-Christian bias to completely color the work and his intolerance of other forms of religious observances is a great turn off to the reader.His primary source for his arguments is the Bible with little acknowledgemnent to other viable, valuable and prooven sources of information.In a nutshell - it is purely supermarket checkout stand material. A definite waste of trees to produce the paper to print it on. The only people who would find it valuable are those who already share the author's point of view so why read it at all??"
1,Looks like church inquisitional apologists hoping to control,"Wow, would we be in for it if the Inquisitions still controlled life on this planet!! Why none of them can ever figure out that the message was to Love Your Neighbor if you want to see the interdimensional Kingdom of Heaven (and God) within is beyond me!! Sad in that they can't see the kernels of truth in all spiritual systems. Too bad they can't get interested in something like The Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manley P. Hall or the new book by John Major Jenkins, Galactic Alignment or David Wilcock's new book on the Oneness taught by some of the mystery schools which had to be ""secret"" and ""mystery"" because of the Inquisitional thinking that doesn't seem to go away easily!! How are we ever going to get to Peace in the world with these Inquisitional thinkers feeling superior over other spiritual viewpoints??"
2,For Beginners,"I found this book to be quite juvenile. I suppose it would be useful to someone just beginning to learn about the subject matter, but if you've done much reading about the holy grail, the illuminati, etc. I definitely wouldn't bother with this one. I also found some information in the book to be just untrue and not well researched. I had the feeling that the author just patched together some facts he had seen in other books, and at points he repeated himself, as though he didn't remember that he just addressed that information a little earlier. I really was expecting more from this author."
4,"Deserves more than a second ""glance""","Wow! - I couldn't put it down. From the beginning I was drawn into the world of Chance and Nick. I found myself hoping that Nick would find a way to win Chance back. A truly romantic novel worthy of a second read. I'm actually hoping for a movie <g> and thinking of who should play each role!~ Hummm... Brad Pitt as Nick perhaps?Although some call this a ""romance"" novel, I call it a ""romantic"" novel. I don't read ""romance"" novels - too unbelievable and ""formulamatic"". Second Chance is definitely NOT a formula story!Buy it. Then fill your tub with hot soapy water and sink into the best story you've read in a while. You'll fall in love with Chance and Nick before the water's cold."
4,First-Round Knockout,This author's first novel is a very interesting and exciting read. O'Neill's characters come alive with interest and passion. The settings are warm and conducive to the story flow. One would hope this is a preview of the quality of work to be expected in her next novel. Bring on Round Two!
4,"Engrossing ""modern"" romance","I hadn't read a ""romance"" novel in a long, long time, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I picked up _Second Chance_. It was a delightful surprise, deftly blending a compelling romantic relationship with a realistic business world setting. The characters felt like *real* people with *real* jobs, concerns, and emotions. A very quick, enjoyable read that will leave you smiling!"
1,not a good second hand purchase,This cannot be used for anything than what it was designed for =big commercial companies for their IS programmers to use. You cannot get wifi or internet play games or use much of it for purposeful things. Even computer specialists do not recommend purchasing these for use. They can't even reprogram them. Not worth the $150 they sell them for.
3,collectors item,The knife is more decorative than practical. I bought this knife and immediately put it to the test. It ships on a blunt edge. It is not easy to sharpen with kitchen utilities but that explains its ability to hold an edge when sharpened. The handle feels natural to the hold- don't wanna say ergonomic. The knife is great at hacking but the rough finishing on the blade above the edge makes it unsuitable for slicing through. I'm yet to test this Chinese made blade for its ability to resist corrosion. The scabbard is made of some plastic molding wrapped up in cheap nylon. The scabbard also fails to secure the blade over the guard and the blade rattles annoyingly in it. Overall I would give it a 6 out of ten largely for its aesthetics.
1,This does not work,I have been taking chitosan for 4 weeks and lost three pounds and gained three pounds. In the beginning I had very bad diarrhea 3-5 times a day for the first week and I believed this was clearing my system of fat. But in fact I was just becoming dehydrated because my body wasn't used to the chitosan. I lost three pounds the first week and was so excited. I took two pills with every meal and ate low in fat foods that were healthy staying under 1500 calories a day. Then during the second week I gained the three pounds back though I kept up my diet and still took the pills. In the third and fourth week my weight didn't change anymore. The only thing this product is good for is a laxative. It might work for others but it did not work for me
3,Too Little Coaching,As a brand new golfer I found the nuggets of advice very helpful. There are just too few of them. Mr. Harmon spends half of the DVD reminiscing about the past. I give the advice five stars and the reminiscing zero stars so they average to 2.5 stars. I rounded up to give him the benefit of the doubt. I saw this video for sale at a golf store for over twice the Amazon price. I'm glad I own it at the Amazon price. I would be ticked-off if I had paid the higher price.
1,Short on substance,"I purchased this video on the 'reputation' of Butch Harmon as one of the pre-eminent instructors in golf. It was an Xmas gift for my wife, who is a single digit golfer, with a desire to work on a broad spectrum of areas in her game.This one of our most disappointing purchases, as it's more of a testimonial to the Harmon family, and the greatness of Butch, than useful information. For the few specific lessons that are actually taught in this tape, Butch narrates techniques and his son demonstrates. He doesn't demonstrate well, and there just isn't adequate content. I would definitely not recommend."
3,Butch Harmon's Ultimate Golf,"In the process of moving to our new library building, I am withdrawing VHS tapes that haven't circulated in the past year. We had some golf tapes that pre-dated our automation in 1996. Out with the old and in with the new! If patrons like the two new golf DVDs, I can look for more titles, too."
1,not as represented,Book is 36 sparse pages (containing many blank pages). Minature book is about 3/8 inch thick. Way overpriced. It is worth about $1.
1,Major Typeo on cover of Brand New book!!!,"I believe amazon is dealing with this issue, but the book was purchased brand new from amazon. The side cover says ""Ooganic Compunds"". Beyond the cover, the inside of the book seems fine so far."
1,wrong book,"i got delivered the wrong book, it was a brand new one but not the one i need and their return policy sucks cuz they give u a week to return the item...i paid for something i dont even need"
3,Reference vs. Teaching Material,"This book has wonderful charts and tables for quick referencing, however it is sorely lacking in demonstrations and worked out examples for students new to the subject. The chapters are painfully slow and complex when explaining the theory behind the spectrometric methods and effects on classes of molecules. In short, don't use this book to learn the material unless you already know it. It is a comprehensive reference, but not an effective textbook to teach from."
3,"Great material, regular text...","The book is subdivided into only 3 of the 4 classical methods for spectrometric identification of compounds: IR, MS, and finally NMR (covering 1H, 13C and very little of 19F and 31P). UV is left out in this edition, so maybe getting a hold of the old edition's UV chapter (which is extremely well-written) might be desired. The MS and the IR chapters are also well-written and explained out. It is in the main technique (NMR) that the author fails to deliver the subject in a straightforward manner and lacks what I think is most important in this field: a large number of exercises and problems."
3,"Good in NMR Spectra analysis information, but weak elsewhere","This book lacked information in my opinion. Silverstein started a good project but just didn't give enough information about IR interpretation, mass spec, C-13 NMR, etc. He focussed on 2-D NMR a great deal, and I believe that there are much better textbooks on this subject."
3,"Very detailed, maybe a little too much...","This book is very detailed, which is great for chemical analysis. However, it's use as a quick reference is lacking; is doesn't have any overview charts or generalized analysis. It makes it rather difficult to find what you need unless you know EXACTLY what you are looking for, and have time to read through a few pages to look for it. Sadly, this isn't usually the case in a rough chemical analysis."
4,Good reference book,"Good reference book if you're doing qualitative analysis of organic compounds using NMR, MS, IR, etc. It's a little old, 1989, but still relevant as the basic principles have not changed much."
5,More Advanced,This book was fine as far as learning spectra but not as detailed as the Pavia book. This book is great if you are already have an advanced understanding of spectroscopy & do not need to go into great detail. If you prefer more detail then Pavia is better.
4,New York Dolls - 'Lipstick Killers' (Roir),"For a bunch of demos, this collection of the Doll's tracks, assembled by the indie label Roir, sure does sound good. 'Lipstick Killers' is apparently the earliest known recordings of the band,recorded in the summer of 1972. Even the group's ORIGINAL drummer Billy Murcia is on here. The tunes that I found myself looking forward to on repeated plays of the CD are ""Looking For A Kiss"", ""Don't Mess With Cupid"", the Doll's signature song (?) ""Personality Crisis"" and ""Frankenstein"". Might want to keep in mind that 'Lipstick Killers' is pretty much aimed at New York Dolls completists."
5,NewYorkDolls 1st Album,"Buy it!! If you are a NewYorkDolls fan, buy it!! Originally released only on cassette tape in 1972 (yes, back in the day cassette tapes were just as popular as vinyl records & before the invention of the compact disc) and then in N.Y.C. in limited quantity. This is a great record.....it's measured, it's tight and it's the only known recording with original drummer Billy Murcia. Oh! to have seen them then!"
3,Reasonably good but prejudiced introduction to the Norman Conquest,"The book is amusing and provides a good overview of the Norman Conquest for people that look for a first approach to the subject. Do not expect a scholarly book, but it has good information, while maintaining good rythm to keep the reader interested. However, it has a serious flaw for any history book that wishes to be seriously considered. The author is more concerned in giving his point of view than in objectively describing facts and events and drawing conclusions from them. Beforehand Harold and the English are the good and almost flawless characters in the story, while the Normans are assigned a villanous role in their responsibility for putting an end to an almost paradisiac pre-Conquest England. The problem is not that the author has a view (we all have one), but that instead of drawing it as a conclusion to the facts he brings to light, he accomodates facts to suit his pre-conception."
3,There are better out there,"1066: The Year of the Conquest is not a bad book, but it's not a very good one either. Howarth compiles a lot of reasonably well known facts and then constructs an almost novelistic narrative around them. While to my knowledge he did not misstate any points of fact, he does infuse his book with a healthy does of personal opinion not based in fact. This is fine if you're writing a 1066-based novel, but Howarth really does at times try to present his work as history.1066: The Year of the Conquest is not a bad book to get your feet wet and introduce yourself to the people and events of 1066. However, if you're more interested in actual, historical scholarship on Hastings and the events surrounding it I would recommend ""1066: The Year of The Three Battles"" by Frank McLynn over at Amazon UK."
5,A Real Page-Turner!,David Howarth does a masterful job of bringing the Norman Conquest to life. The collected evidence is fascinating and the way he puts it together makes the story truly compelling--I had trouble putting it down. This book is a wonderful medium for those who like history but have trouble connecting with many of the books available. It is very down-to-earth and easy to read. It sparked my interest in the subject and inspired me to further study of the dramatic events of 1066. Happy reading!
3,"Good intro, but speculative","Howarth tells an interesting story well. He gives context and explanations, and writes well. Why only three stars then? Because too often he speculates, or follows uncritically late sources. In one example he cites a story discrediting an English character. The story occurs only in one late and tendentious Norman source. After acknowledging its inherent implausibility, and the unreliability of the Norman source ... he goes on to modify the story (900 years ex post facto) and accept the new version!"
4,"Pretty good, overall","David Howarth does an excellent job in presenting a complex bit of history in a way that reflects the people involved and societies. On that count, it is really a five star. My only concern is that I don't agree always with his suppositions or his conclusions.But definitely a worthwhile book and a good read as well!"
4,"Excellent reading, perfect weekend reader",Mr. Howarth provides excellenct historical reading. This book does not require prior knowledge or understanding of 11th century England to be enjoyed. Mr. Howarth clearly details enough relevant information for laymen to understand both the political and military aspects of 1066
3,A simple book,"The work is historically accurate and presented in an uncomplicated and gentle style. Howarth, however, is an unskilled writer and certainly not an erudite. He somewhat inelegantly presents major historical events in a storybook fashion to keep the reader interested, and writes at a level, while accessible to younger children, is unnecessarily patronizing (e.g. parenthetically adding that Harald Hardrada's first name is spelled with two `a's' is rather foolish). Howarth needs to improve his writing proficiency and avoid the temptation to insert his own voice into the story, especially to refer back to his other works. Despite these criticisms, this is a good book for anyone aged 14-20 years who is seeking an introduction to some of the events surrounding the Norman invasion of England."
2,1066 and All That,"""1066 and all that..."" being the stock British phrase for the Norman Conquest, this book should have been titled ""All That."" You slog through so much extraneous, badly organized material (including Saxon and Scandinavian names)that it makes the stereotypical Russian novel look like a model of clarity. Up to about page 100 there's the occasional paragraph pointing out which way we're going and after that, golly, sometimes a whole page or two of clear storyline. There's actually some interesting stuff but 11th century history and politics were a mess and this book doesn't do much to clear things up."
2,"A boring read for kids , informative read for adults","i was given this book to read by my teacher , and i couldnt read more than 5 pages at a time , its too much of an overload. its gives too much information that isnt needed , i think its a okay book because it is well written but it really dissapointed me on how truely boring it was too read , i suggest that older people read this not younger kids , if you dont believe me , youll find out before the 2nd page."
5,COOL,This is really something new. I never have had this kind of shaving experience and been that close with a elec. razor. I think you can compare it with the result of a mach 3! COOL
1,WE BROKE OUT,me and old my broke out with horrible acne from the lotion stuff in this razor. its not worth it
1,too may pages,"I was recommended by my therapist to read this book, but I couldn't even open the first page when I saw it at a bookstore because it was a huge book. Simply overwhelmed and started crying. I have to read all this to get better? I can't... no way...."
3,Feeling Good,"Read it as part of a mental health group session at the VA. It has good information about how to keep track of your ""feelings"" and how to recognize triggers that can help you avoid anger and depression."
4,Feeling Good; the new mood therapy,Helpful advice about overcoming depression using cognitive therapy techniques. Format is a little hard to read but I recommend it for its tried and true methods.
3,service is good ...cause I keep coming back,"I received the book in no time at all,I had ordered used so there were a few pages that had been slashed but all were accounted for.Enjoying the read.Kathy"
3,Interesting,"An interesting book. Having never tried Cognitive Therapy before I find that it has helped me look at problems differently. It was a hard read for me since I don't find all of the statistics helpful, just a hinderance. Take from it what you need and leave the rest!"
2,his claims are too universal,"Some people make decisions according to how they think; their thoughts give rise to their feelings. Such people might like this book. More power to them. For me and for many others, it is the other way around: feelings give rise to thoughts. In order for ""feelers"" to overcome problems, we need empathy. Being told we're thinking the wrong way just exacerbates the feeling of being wrong. Also, like other reviewers, I found that the book seemed unedited, rambling, and repetitive. I'm glad some have found it beneficial. I benefit more from dealing with feelings before thoughts."
1,not what I thought,"I was hoping to have a practical workbook to get a better idea about cognitive behavior therapy and the effects of dysfunctional thinking, but this is more of a reading book that can be quite boring at times. While it gives examples of some of Dr Burns patients, it fails to provide practical application. I gave up on it exactly halfway through the book."
3,Not Bad,"""The Feeling Good Handbook"" by Dr. Burn proves a much more helpful aid than this, especially since his focus isn't so antimedicine in that book. Medication is a key component in effective cognitive therapy for the seriously depressed or anxious patient. This book tends to downplay the crucial importance that medicine can play in the healing process."
3,Good CBT book,I got a lot out of Rational Emotive Therapy from Albert Ellis. This book is somewhat more detailed and takes more time and effort to use but is worth it.
4,Some timeless truth in this book -- take what you can and leave the rest,You don't have to read every page of this book and work every exercise offered in order to get some help in dealing with your depression. My copy of this book was published in 1980 and I refer back to it a couple of times a year as a refresher. I found great value in his 10 cognitive distortions list and have used them to catch myself in mid-thought and really begin to see how I put myself on the path to depression. The advice in this section of his book is timeless and useful. I have never done all the exercises and I have never used his wrist counter idea. Others may find it helpful or not. But I have lent this book to others who were experiencing depression and every one of them found something of value in the book.
4,good range of cognitive skills....,"....and I've found it useful in working with my therapy clients--but be informed that if you want to know more about what's under your ""negative"" feelings, you won't find it here. The down side to a purely cognitive approach is its assumption that feeling ""good"" is the optimal goal, whereas vital individuals feel comfortable in their entire range of feelings."
4,The power of positive thinking,"'Feeling Good' is a classic and probably should be read by everyone. I say this in spite of coming from the school of thought that much of depression is biochemical and is not easily undone without medication.Nonetheless, correcting negative thought patterns is an important part of undoing depression, especially mild depression. Highly recommended."
5,The Only Book I Value More Than This is the Bible,"I first ran across Feeling Good back in the 80s. I come from a family that has a history of depression, and I had it bad. As it turns out a pituitary tumor was the primary source of my depression, but before I found that out this book helped me make it from day to day. I recommend it even for people who aren't depressed. It will help your thinking skills and improve your quality of life tremendously.I can't begin to count the number of people I have recommended this book to. As a preacher people often come to me with all kinds of problems. A lot of them grow out of poor thinking habits, and when they do I recommend this book."
5,I use it with chronically mentally ill patients. It works.,I use this book in groups and in bibliotherapy for my patients. I find it is simple enough that most people don't have difficulty with understanding it. I also enjoy the examples and exercises that Burns uses. This is a very useful book for people who want to feel better.
3,"Trying to ""FEEL GOOD""","Unfortunately, it is very hard to get into this book. I hear over & over how great it is, but the entire beginning is so dry. It is all about the process of studying the brain & moods, and how it came about, etc. Anyone that is trying to get a grip on their feelings, or life, or just working on themselves enough to buy a book about it, does not CARE about how the technique was developed. Not only how, but when, and by who. Ugh! Get past it, start a bit into it instead of at the beginning, or you'll never pick it up again."
2,feeling good,"Did not keep my attention so I put it down and never picked it up again. Have it somewhere, dont know."
3,Hay que desafectarlo,"Este comentario va en castellano porque su máxima utilidad es para lectores no usamericanos.El libro es bueno, muy bueno diria, pero el lector no usamericano debe hacer un trabajo constante para ""desusamericanizarlo"" pues el libro tiene muchas cosas que solo son razonables para alguien que tenga membresía en ese marco cultural.En resumen: en medio de bastante ruido cultural hay buena información de caracter bastante ""universal""."
3,Text book,This book reads like a text book and it is really long. Has 681 pages. It's kinda dry but helpful for certain sections and for reference. Not too bad in small doses.
2,Disappointed,"I really needed Burns' therapy to be effective, so I read it, tried to take it to heart, and did the exercises diligently. Now, I just feel silly for having done the exercises. I find the attempts to respond to distorted thoughts within Burns' therapeutic framework even more unnatural and distorted than the original thoughts themselves.What was effective was applying these techniques under the guidance of a CBT therapist. But,once the therapy ended, so did the benefits. For me it all comes down to the notion that if you are looking for argument and dialectic that satisfies at a deeper level, then this ""quick fix"" therapy is not the right one for you.An additional note: Burns' writing does not appeal to the imagination or the intellect. In the interest of achieving universal clarity, he seems to dumb everything down."
1,Dumb book!,"Basically all it says is, ""In order to feel good don't be sad."" NO KIDDING! UGH infuriating and a huge waste of money."
4,books,I was very pleased with the prompt service that I received from Amazon.com. The books arrived in perfect condition.I would certainly use your service again.
1,sorry doc but no thanks,"Interesting discussions about meds otherwise don't waste yout time or money. There is nothing original here that you have heard or read many times before. Besides, if it's ""self help"" you want you won't get it from a book you will not need to waste your money, especially on this one."
5,GROUNDBREAKING SELF-HELP BOOK,The title says it all. Read yourself out of a depression... this book is thee ultimate book. David Burns is my favorite author right now. His compassionate style makes you feel good automatically. The knowledge in this book is priceless. I swear by my review. Ex-Depressed
4,"Good book, includes proactive assignments, could be better","An excellent read with powerful therapeutic techniques and examples to change your attitude. Although I give it 4 stars, it could be better. Dr. Burns talks about getting back a lost relationship way too much and implies that your own communication skills and attitude are the reason for the breakup. The book does not address the underlying feeling of what happened to you in your past that generated the flawed thinking that you want to change. However, this is a very good tool for anyone who needs an attitude adjustment."
5,Recommended by my Doctor,This book is full of wonderful ideas on how to stop negative thinking so that I can no longer suffer from depression and the associated behavior. It gives me the tools I need to cure myself!
4,Thank goodness,"I bought this book for my 17 yr old daughter who had refused therapy since going through depression. She has raved about this book and how much she has learned about herself and the resources that are available when she needs them. I have no doubt that, as a result of reading this book, if the need arises, she will be much more willing to seek professional assistance in terms of therapy. Moreover, the book is providing great ideas on coping strategies. This is absolutely one of the very best resources that my daughter has ""allowed"" me to share with her."
3,One of three that works for me.,"As a consumer of mental health services and the related books, I think I have read most of what is available. Undoing Depression is clearly the best, followed by Breaking the Patterns of Depression. Feeling Good has been helpful in keeping me on track after the others have reached through the fog that envelops my control panels. As my wife put it, it's like the recipes you can use after you first decide you want to cook something and have secured the necessary ingredients."
4,The New Mood Therapy Is A Must Read.,"I've battled depression for a while, however, after reading Dr. Burns Feeling Good Handbook and the New Mood Therapy book, I can truly say these are first class, top-notch, must read books. Chapters are laid out in an easy to read fashion and the concepts presented can be applied to all areas of your life. I will say, you need to read the Feeling Good Handbook first and then The New Mood Therapy, however, just reading these will get you in the right frame of mind to start feeling better."
2,A little dissapointed,"The book did have some good content, but I was disappointed. Because the book got so many good reviews, I thought it must have been written by God himself. It wasn't. Some of the optimism presented in the book seems just a tad unrealistic to me. Incidentally, the book was written by the same person who wrote ""Ten Days to Self-Esteem"" which I think is very unrealisitc. Dr. Burns seems to live in a world where ugliness and stupidity do not exist, or at least where they can be renamed something like ""differently beautified"" or ""differently talented"". I am a person who prides herself on calling things as they are, however, and sometimes it gets me into trouble. Not only with others, but also with myself."
5,Every Human Being Should Read This Book,"I am not big on self help books, but this book has changed my life! I am always striving to be the best person I can be and this book can help you get there."
3,feeling good,"I love the advise in this book. Being a used book,it is written in and a little ragged; however all the pages are there in good condition. All in all i am very pleased with this book and the people it came from. Be sure to get the updated version. It was written in the 60's and updated to the 80's. Still very good being that old."
1,Not Worth It,"Dr Burns seems to have the god complex that most psychiatrists suffer from. He makes it sound like he is so gifted and intelligent, while the reader is simply stupid. If it wasn't for the writing style I might have found this book atleast interesting if not at all helpful. For some people prehaps his approach works but for sensitive, feeling individuals this book is a constant put down, telling you how your thinking is wrong and bad. The cover is also misleading, its obviously not drug free when the last third of the book is devoted entirely to explainations of drugs. I'm interested to know if anyone actually followed his suggestion of the wrist clicker, since depressed people already feel different enough they really don't need to walk around clicking away at their wrist to exaggerate the feeling. Overall, I'm very sorry I wasted my money on this book."
3,Feeling Good,"It was sent in a timely manner, was used which included written comments from the previous owner. This was no big deal."
2,book,"I got half-way through this before I tossed it from the examples of a woman blaming herself for her husband's adultery. I think some of this book can be helpful for people, but there are better self-help books out there."
4,A must-read for anyone suffering from depression,Some very good ideas and exercises that can be a great resource for anyone willing to and needing to battle the demon of depression
5,More then you think,"I got turned onto this book through a Sales Performance Program by Aaron Hemsley, via Nick Murray. WOW - so much more then I expected. Who knew looking for Business Success you'd find so much more. Frankly, kinda of blown away, since this book is kind of dated how true to life it is. No psycho bable, this is real and will help you in so many ways. More then success it offers peace of mind. More then noting the obvious, simple tools on how to overcome. Who'd think something about depression would impact so many parts of my life. A must read!"
3,It's OK,This book is just OK. It caters to the seriously depressed rather than the every day moods. Some of the exercises were helpful or at least good to know. Average.
2,Not at all what I expected...,"Coming from a younger perspective, this book was very hard for me to understand. I tried to read it, and tried, but it was somewhat technical and hard to comprehend. I have suffered from severe depression for most of my life, and this book just didn't do anything for me. I think that this book is okay for an adult audience which suffers from, at most, moderate depression. For those of you with more severe depression, I can tell you from experience, that *DBT (maybe even CBT) works much better than this book.(*Dialectical Behavior Therapy)I hope that this helped you."
2,wouldn't fully rely on it,"OK, here's my story. I've been severely depressed for 2 years, and this was the first book I read for depression, and I did a lot of work with it. Well, id did help me, but may be only 15%. The author applies that we can change our way of thinking, well, some of it but not everything. There're some things that we can't change because we live in a society with its own values and expectation, and we can't become completely ignorant toward some things that we've believed in all our life, and in which people who surround us believe in it, too. Also, we can't fool ourself, if something is bad, we can't tell ourself that it's good, if we keep practicing saying that, than, our unconscious mind won't trust our conscious mind."
2,"Good Information, but complicated.","This book is full of good information, but I found it a little over whelming. I have been hospitalized for depression and I found it hard to stay interested. It was also difficult to follow & confusing. Unfortunately, when you are clinically depressed you don't have the energy or drive to work with all that is presented to you in this book.I would recommend this book for the mildly depressed, or someone who is already overcoming depression."
4,The book is not a cure-all but has good principles.,"Dr. Burns has been criticzied for being shallow, and preaching quick-fixes to emotional problems that aren't real. This is not true. For those that understand that no one has a cure-all method to mental health Dr. Burns writings offer some good principles that help people learn how they perceive the world and how that effects their mental state. These principles do work, I have used them and found them to be good tools for working through my problems with other people."
4,Book buying customer,"My shrink suggested I buy Feeling Good so I did. It's a good book that has obviously been written by someone who's done a lot of research on the subject of depression. But that's the problem, for me it's too much research.The book is longer than a depressed person has patience to read. It's over 700 pages and all that is packaged in a small paperback. All I want is the results of the research not hundreds of pages of studies and survays and research. I know it's good to know all this stuff but as a depressed person I don't really care about it. All I'm interested in is in dealing with the depression. Bottom line, I havn't finished the book yet because it's too much like a text book and that's hardly what I need.Other than that, as I say, it's a good book with a lot of information if you have time to either read it all or try and find the info you're looking for without putting it away for later."
5,This Book Saved My Life,"I can think back to when I purchased this book. It was a gloomy day in Washington, D.C. where I was stationed with the Marines Corps. I was an active alcoholic and suicidally depressed. I wandered in a bookstore in Pentagon city looking for an answer. This book is what i found. It gave me hope and practical strategies to improve my depressed thinking and begin my path to recovery. It took a few years for me to get my life together, but I definitely have to credit Dr. Burns Book with giving me hope that there was an answer to my desperate state of wanting to die on a daily basis. The strategies in this book combined with medication allowed me to escape the ""HELL"" of depression and begin living a peaceful and content life. Thank You Dr. Burns. Of course I highly recommend this book."
4,IS IT FOR EVERYONE? LET THE READER DECIDE.,"As one who has studied psychology and has worked as a counsellor for many years, I agree in general principles with what the author is attempting to express throughout the pages of the book. The book may not be terribly beneficial solely as a self-help book for I know many individuals, particularly those who are chronically depressed, that simply would not have the stamina or attention span to ""stick with the program."" For others, it may be difficult to thoroughly understand and follow. Therefore, the book will probably work best when used in conjunction with your qualified therapist or psychologist. I do not believe that any one particular form of therapy necessarily works for everyone; we are each unique individuals who respond to various forms of therapy in different ways."
2,If your problems are due to negative thinking alone...,"...then this very upbeat book by Dr. Burns can indeed help. But I very much doubt the central thesis that thoughts control feelings and that substituting positive for negative thought patterns is the key to happiness.One telling omission in Burns' book is how to cope with ill health, especially where medicine has no answers. It would seem to me that if there is any area that could serve as a test bed for Burns' thesis that thinking is the key to ""feeling good"", this would be it. And yet there is nothing here on subjects like coping with chronic pain.To be sure, one can in fact cultivate self-defeating and negative thoughts and attitudes, and if that is your issue, this book can be very helpful. But if you are looking for something more profound in combating serious depression or other emotional travails, I'd advise you to look elsewhere."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this book to deal with anxiety issues related to cancer treatment, fears of the unknown, etc. I am not depressed and therefore did not find it helpful for my particular situation."
5,Feel Good,Good book! Arrived on time and in good condition. This book would help anyone to analyse their thoughts and make corrections in actions and thought toward a better life. I highly recommend it!
2,Hard to Follow,"While the ideas presented in this book are good, it is very difficult to follow and absorb. There is too much technical jargon. It would have been much more helpful if it had been written in a much simpler way. While trying to already sift through all our emotions and thoughts, we don't need more to have to try to figure out. Never finished the book."
1,Not the book for beginners,"This book was nothing but a let down.As a novice PS user, I found the instructions to be sadly lacking with steps left out, and directions that just didn't work.I had assumed from the name--Teach Yourself Adobe Photoshop 7--that the book would be geared to beginners. It wasn't. Maybe if I had used PS 6 or the like in the past I would have known, for example, that step 1, 2 and 3 were implied and that the author was starting at step 4. As it was, I was just confused.I also wonder if the book wasn't rushed into print too fast without the needed editing. There were quite a few techniques that I followed (many times) step by step that just did not work the way the author said they did.All in all, I would recommend that anyone interested in learning Photoshop do what I'm doing now and find a better instructional book."
2,Glaring Omission,"As I have been wading through this book for the past week, I have found it more and more difficult to understand. This book's glaring omission in my opinion is its lack of physical graphic images that I can manipulate. We need to see before-and-after examples done with our own hands that explain what she is talking about. The first image that you can download on line is well into chapter 3. I got the most frustrated with the ""Cut and Paste"" section in chapter 3 which had no photos on line for me to recreate with her, and her explanation of how to Paste was non-existent. It was at this point that I decided to move on to another book."
2,"agreed, too much left out or just glossed over","Steps omitted, no visuals for icons and also mentioning a feature and then saying nothing else about it. I don't care what the ""so called expert"" had to say, the book is bad. Try another one."
1,This is a book for home use for a pro program,"don't know how long it's been since I've been so disapointed in a book. Here's the problem. Photshop is a fully featured program for professionals. This book spends way too much time on filters that you won't normally use and not enough time on what you really need. I went out & bought the book right after I got the program a few weeks ago. At the time it was all that I could find, but it has little or no info on creating & using actions, styles or macros. It doesn't teach you the fast ways to do tasks. I learned a bunch more from The Photoshop Wow book which also has a CD of really great styles & actions. Photoshop 7 Down & dirty tricks is also great."
1,This book is terrible,"Maybe the so called expert thinks this book is a 5 Star but take it from a novice, this book is absolutely terrible. Think twice before you buy."
1,disappointed wasted money,ok..dis book is juss way too confusing...oof..aldoh i read da whole book..i got nothin out of it...b/c we already kno how to do those basic shizz...fliters etc...but this boook spends way too much explainin about pointless crap....which makes it boring plus complicatin....i was hopin to learn photoshop 7 tricks...but yea...this book is stoopid...dont get it...
3,Good for UNIX Beginners,"If you have limited experience on UNIX and end up in a job where you have to learn AIX admin, then this is the correct book. If you have indepth UNIX experience with HP-UX or NCR, etc, then you will outgrow this book in about 15 minutes. There are many tasks that need to be done that are not available in smit (smitty). This book won't cover them."
4,The AIX Survival Guide,The best book available for AIX system administrators. Hopfully a newer version will be released shortly.
5,Best AIX Book On The Market,"If there were only reference guides for Solaris and HP-UX as good as this one.... If you're a beginner, this book will likely be over your head (get O'Reilly's sysadm book instead). But if you're already familiar with SVR4, this makes learning AIX a snap."
3,"Not a bad book, but out of date, and not for newbie","If you are a newbie to AIX, get trained first (preferably from IBM) before reading this book. Otherwise, you will feel sleepy and confused.Overall this is not a bad book, consider it is out of date... here I am writing a review near the end of 2006.There are still many functions that would apply to AIX 5L; if you are looking for the most current book to match with your AIX 5L, this would NOT be the book.I would not consider this as reference book either... It's more of a casual reading on AIX...."
5,Excellent AIX reference book with plenty of practical tips,"This is an excellent AIX reference book with plenty of practical tips for system administrators. It differs greatly from the IBM's AIX manuals because the content is concise, focused and describes the virtues (and shortcomings) of AIX. I have been preparing for IBM's advanced AIX system administration certification exams and have found the information this book to be extremely useful not only for the exams, but also in my daily administration duties. The author clearly knows his stuff!"
2,Not such a good book,"I guess back in 1981 this book was a good reference, but sewing has changed. This book addresses none of this new stuff. First, there are fancy new notions now that make sewing faster and easier. Second, sergers are now in the home market. And lastly, color photos (although they existed then) are now in MOST good sewing books and readily available. This book is outdated and I am sorry I bought it. (Thank goodness used for only a few bucks. You get what you pay for.)The author's techniques are not shortcuts, but are the standard in sewing techniques. Nothing new here. The book is filled with illustrations, although most sewing techniques described do not have an accompanying drawing.Get a better book (or books) like the Easy Guide sewing series instead."
1,Christian theology bias subverts veracity,"After reading about half of this book the author's blatant pro-Christian bias became so obvious that I could not continue. The continued use of date references using BC/AD instead of the more scholarly BCE/CE notation is a minor detail but is only the beginning. Frequent references to time periods ""before the birth of Christ"", explications of Christian doctrinal positions to illuminate various events and decisions, and biblical quotes assuming literal truth all provide ample evidence to doubt the objectivity and historical accuracy of this author. This ""New History"" adds nothing of value to the exciting field analyzing the history of the Roman Empire and its collapse."
5,Drawing order out of the descent into chaos,"Nearly everyone ""knows"" about the ""fall of the Roman Empire"". This is the first work I have read (not having the stamina to finish Gibbons) that explains just what happened. Working with always inadequate source material, but helped by the results of 20th Century archeology, Heather gives us a fascinating and plausible narative of the one hundred years that saw the end of the Roman Empire in the west, and the beginning of the Middle Ages. A little long, and a bit too detailed for a layman (after all, Heather is a professor writing in the first place for other academics), but still well worth reading for anyone interested in Roman history, or for that matter, in the anarchy which is always waiting out there."
5,"finally, a lot of engaging substance","like most people, when i saw this book is about 500 pages i do what most do and allowed myself to be slightly deterred. but, due to my fascination with the roman world i bought it. i can tell you that after reading this book at no point did i ever feel bored. heather keeps the reader interesting with interesting stories and analysis that is truly captivating. no details or aspects are missed and it is genuinely a fun and intriguing read for any history buff."
4,The fall of the Roman Empire,"I found the book to be a great read, but found it hard with some of the words used. had to look upalot."
3,making an article a book,"This is the classic case of making an article a book. The article: ""The Huns and the End of the Roman Empire in Western Europe"" found in The English Historical Review was written by the author in 1995. The difference in language is astounding. While in the article the author uses normal academic English, in the book we are treated to phrases like ""Super Powers"" (a term from the 20th century) and chapter titles like: ""Thrace: The Final Frontier"" (from Star Trek). As more than one reviewer notes (see below), this gives the book a silly tone and is more than annoying. The fact is that it needn't be as long. Get the article which is 40 pages long and save your money from this generally long-winded and awkward book. Nonetheless, I give it 3 stars as it contains much information. The author's thesis: that the Huns set in motion migrations that were too much for the empire to handle is sound and well presented in both the article and book."
3,"Good, not great.","I agree 100% with the last reviewer - the presentation was awkward, and I found the book to be difficult to read for more than 20 or 30 pages at a time. The content was insightful, and I'm glad I read it...it just wasn't all that ""fun"" of a read."
5,Great review of the Roman empire,I learned so much about what was probably the most important civilization in human history. History written like a novel.
5,Excellent history,Rome fell because of immigration and not because of Christianity as Gibon speculated nor did it collapse because of an expanded beauracacy.
3,"Uncle, uncle!","Didn't need 450 pages for Heather to explain that the barbarian invasions had a huge influence on the fall of the Roman Empire. I expected a new look at an old argument, and greater comparison / contrast of other hypotheses for its fall. After all, this is a new book. Instead, this read as a tunnel-vision history of Roman interaction with the barbarian invaders and included very little discussion of other factors present that contributed to Rome's fall, including internal power struggles, devaluation of currency or other social factors that perhaps made the military less effective. There is barely a counter-argument to his hypothesis in the entire book. Disappointing considering the hype."
1,Very Poor Kindle Edition,"Superb book, but absolutely ruined by the horrible transcription of the book to Kindle format. Maps are blurry, even at normal size, so forget enlarging. And maps are critical to following the text of the book. I am very upset."
2,"Like father, not like son......","Redline was supposed to be a high octane action/drama movie with a suspense topping plot including hot cars and add Chad Mcqueen (the infamous Steve Mcqueen's son), and this sounds like a hot movie right? Wrong! This movie has a very bad storyline which honestly doesn't have you holding your breath at any given time during the flick, the acting leaves much to be desired including Chad's on screen presense which is nowhere near the caliber of actor his father was, and even the car chase scenes are so flat and slow between the Jaguar XJS and Chad Mcqueen's Highland green fastback Mustang. A cheesy movie which i consider along the lines of ""Overdrive"", ""Banzai Runner"" and other b-rated car movies. Now i am a sucker for b movies, but this one truly was completely boring and makes you wonder if it was even unscripted during filming. Nice try Chad, but no cigar."
3,deffanetly a B movie,"the best thing I can say about this movie is , the young lady has great tits, and whats with jan-michiel vincents lip ???? the car chases, very boring, and you can see that they changed cars , the mustang looked like it had no damage after being run into by the jag, even the door opened with no problem."
1,NO NO NO! on/off fails after 2 months,"0 stars. I bought one of these in March, and it died in early May - the on button would not turn it on. I bought another [stupid me] to replace it; it was a great price [hint] and I guessed I had gotten a lemon with the first one. No, both were lemons, and the second one failed after two months. I am shopping for something else and don't know what I'll get, but it darned sure ain't gonna be another Conair!!! Keep shopping, folks. You'll regret this purchase. mb"
1,Complete junk,It won't curl my hair. I set it at 15 and I wait and wait and wait and my hair falls flat. My hair can curl with curling irons but not this one!
1,"WARNING: This doesn't have the CHROME barrell, it has the multi-layer (crappy) barrell!","BUYER BEWARE, PRODUCT NOT AS DESCRIBED: I bought this only because the descripiton says it has the CHROME barrell. Unfortunately, Conair switched the curling iron to a very crappy ""Multi-barrell"" technology that does not slide across your hair when curling. All the stores are now carrying the Multi-barrell iron, so I was specifically seeking the CHROME barrell. Since the description stated that it is the CHROME barrell, I purchased it. When it arrived, I was greatly disappointed that they sent me a multi-layer barrell curling iron! Thank goodness Amazon has a fairly simply return policy."
1,Order was cancelled,My order was cancelled by the vendor because the item was out of stock. It was in stock when I ordered it and it still shows as being in stock.
1,conair curling iron,Broken after 3 months.... Don't have the box to return it. Not sure what resources I have now. Don't really want to spend the money on a new one...but I guess I have to. Very disappointed as this curling iron was a replacement of the same one I hade for years.
4,Love the curls but they dont stay.,"This take about 30 seconds to heat up and curls my hair beautifully but the curls just don't stay, maybe its my hair though. Still I love this curler."
5,Love It!!,After seeing a couple of reviews about this product I went ahead and ordered it and I can honestly say I have no regrets! It heats up quick as the ad said and makes awesome curls as well. Also got it for a good price with free shipping as well so who could complain!!
5,"Instant Heat Curling Iron, 1-Inch","The product was received in perfect condition within a very short time after I ordered it. It works beautifully, as expected, from the manufacturer, Conair. I highly recommend Amazon.com for selection of products, speed of delivery and Conair for quality of hair dryers."
5,I've had this curling iron before and been pleased with it.,"This is the same curling iron I've been buying for the last 10 years, it's just been updated a little. Still is a gem for the price."
4,good for the price,"With this curling iron I got exactly what I wanted, which was a decent curling iron at a good price. It heats up very quickly. I would like if it got a little hotter, but it gets the job done. I would probably purchase it with a smaller barrel next time as the curls from this iron are a little bigger than I wanted, but that's not the curling iron's fault. Overall, I would recommend!"
1,Not turning on...,"Initially I thought this iron was great but after less than 6 months of very light use & good care, the power button is not working. I tried changing to a different heat level & that worked a couple of times but now is completely dead. The power button appears fine so there must be a short wire inside the iron. Boo! This makes me wonder if Amazon.com receives defective items hoping to sell cheap? According to amazon, Ibought this less than 6 months ago. Disappointed!"
3,CURLING IRON BY CONAIR,"This curling iron works fine, heats well, and so I DO use it & like it okay. It just works stiffly, & has a sliding ring that adjusts the heat setting, which I sometimes slide accidentally while using it and so the heat setting changes when I don't intend it to. Otherwise it does work fine."
2,Dissapointed,I had to return this product. I bought this as a gift for my sister and she said that it did not get very hot.She could not even put curls in her hair.
3,Not all are reliable,"My wife has used these curling irons for a long time. Finally, one had to be replaced. Then she decided she needed another on to leave in her travel bag, so we have two new curling irons. Both worked great initially. Unfortunately, one of them has stopped working after only two months of use. She hasn't returned it yet. We hope this is an anomaly. If it weren't for the early failure of one of the curling irons, this would be a five star rating."
1,Ergonomically Correct?,"I'm having pain in my arm and shoulder from trying to reach and press down on the clamp. I have to position my hand over the numbered dial versus the handle because the position of the clamp is difficult to reach and press down. I haven't seen any reviews mentioning this but about the time I started using the curling iron, I began experiencing unexplained pain. It could be a coincidence but for me, this curling iron is very awkward and uncomfortable to use. I find that reaching and pressing the clamp down is a very uncomfortable maneuver."
4,Works Fine,I bought this for my sister and she likes it. However the packaging for this looks dodgy and looks cheap. It doesnt have a brand for this whatsoever.
3,some like it hotter,"I have extremely thick hair, even though this curling iron has different temperature settings, I don't think even the hottest is hot enough. Maybe it's impatience or maybe my hair is hard to curl, but I think hotter equals faster. Other than that I have not complaints."
2,The cord does not swirl,Even though it says the cord will swirl so it doesn't twist up but the swirl is so tight it doesn't work. I find my self constantly untwisting it. I am about to by another one for I just can't take it any more.
3,Decent product,Product was okay cord was short curls didn't last. But for the price what do u expect .thats all I could say
2,Gave out after only three months,"I bought this curling iron after my cheap Revlon die after 5 years of faithful service. I read the reviews and they basically looked good and the price was reasonable. And it worked for three months. But I began noticing the click button took more and more attempts to get it ""on"". Yesterday I clicked desperately for 15 minutes trying to get ready for church. Let's just say I looked pretty sad and went to a store immediately afterwards and bought a new one.Also, while it still worked, the rest metal bar seemed to always be at odds with either my hand or my hair.Bottom line, you could do better. Keep looking."
5,Who needs a ceramic flat iron!?!,This product has a heat setting so you can set the desired temperature. The design of the handle makes this easy to use. And the metal part doesn't burn your hair but straightens and curls just so. I absolutely love it and have no intentions of converting to a ceramic. This does the same thing so why pay so much more for a ceramic?
5,Excellent!,I bought this after a recent trip to the hairdresser and needed a curling iron to do my hair. I have been using it for about a month now and it is holding up wonderfully. It heats up quickly and has a nice long cord. I am very pleased with this purchase.
3,Decent Value For Money Spent,"As other reviewers have said, this curler does heat up quickly. It has over 20 different heat settings, and a button that allows you to add extra heat to style with.What I don't like about this curler is that I have to use a ton of hairspray to make the curls stay in. I've definitely seen better curlers out there- in one particular case, a lady had curled my hair and added no products afterwords, and the curls stayed in all day.Definitely good overall for a pretty cheap curler, however. I bought this at Macy's and it's fine for the $15 or so I spent on it, but remember: in general, what you pay for, is what you get."
1,Junk,The first one I bought used it and loved it. The second time I went to use it I started to smell something burning. OK so I pulled the plug and waited and then tried it again. Wouldn't even get hot. Emailed Conair and wasted time with them so I just returned it to the store. I went and got another one this week and it worked the first time and the second time I couldn't get it even to warm up. So back it goes. What are the odds of it happening twice unless they can from the same batch? Does that make sense. Lets try for the third time and see what happens.
4,Worked great in Brazil!,"I needed a dual voltage curling iron and found this on Amazon. I had read that others found the temperature control move when they used it, but I didn't have that issue. It heats up very quickly and worked fine on the 220v in Brazil."
3,Use with caucious,"it may burn your hair if you're not a pro. I use it occationally, but I find it difficult to control and shape the curve you desire. After a while, I noticed that my hair becomes dry and the tips are slightly damaged by the heat. I probably won't use it in near future."
5,"Exactly as pictured, works great!","Great product- lots of different heat settings, work exactly as you'd want a curling iron to work! Cheap price- AND great product- don't find that too often!"
2,Stupid design,I would love this if it didn't have this little plastic tab at the top of the barrel that sticks out. I guess it's supposed to help keep your hair on the hot part. But in actuality it means you can't pull the iron down through the curls unless you lift up on the handle thing. Every time I tried to take out the barrel my hair would snag on this useless piece and it would knot up my hair. The dumbest design ever.
3,gift,purchased for my mom with short hair. Works well. make sure it has an automatic shut off feature for safety.
4,Pretty Good,This curling iron gets the job done. It heats up super fast. Not as smooth as a pro. but for the money it's great.
4,Best of the cheaper curling irons,"I've had this very same Conair curling iron over the last 15 years in 3 different sizes. I've rarely had to replace them....ever. Still have the first 2 I bought about 15 years ago. Just had to replace the third size (since I used it alot) last year. Bought a different brand and am not happy with it. Wish I would've bought another one of these! So, my niece wants a curling iron for Christmas - I'm buying her this one!"
1,Horrible!,I bought this exact curling iron in a 1 1/4 inch. I was so excited after reading many good reviews. This was junk! I let it heat up for several minutes before trying it and my hair would not hold a curl. I was so disgusted. I am in the process of returning it...hopefully it wont be a hassle!
4,Works as expected,"Purchased as a replacement for my curling iron that bit the dust. This heats up fast and works as expected. Still getting used to the smaller handle, but overall I like it"
1,Wondering if mine was defective -- way too hot!,"Though I'm an Amazon Prime member, I actually bought this at Walgreens. I picked it because of the many heat settings. My hair curls super easily and holds a curl for days so I wanted really, really low heat to prevent damage to my hair. For some reason, even at the lowest setting this was way, way too hot. I want a setting that won't burn my fingers when I touch it. I'm thinking it may have been defective. If anyone can recommend a curling iron that actually has a very low heat setting, I would very much appreciate the help. Thanks!"
4,STILL IN USE,Wanted a curling iron with all the features offered by this one. Am very pleased with it and would buy another.
4,Gift for Niece,"Bought this for my niece, I haven't heard anything negative about this item, so I guess it is working well."
4,Massive Clean Boost. Hi-gain Boost - Not so Much...,"Hooked into the direct-to-amp signal path, this pedal gives a massive boost when running a clean signal. However, the boost is very, very minimal when applied to a hi-gain signal. I found the best way to get a lead boost for gain is to run it through the effects loop of my amp. When doing so, the effects loop input and output signals need to be adjusted properly to minimize 'tone suck' from the dry signal. It took about three minutes of playing with the effects loop settings and now we are golden! Either way, there is a fairly significant 'coloring' of the tone so I'm deducting one star for that. Again, this is more noticeable on a gain signal. The clean signal is less affected."
5,"Another great set, so long as you can get it for retail.","The My First Dollhouse Mom and Dad's Room is a great product for toddlers. I have two daughters, 4 and 2, who play with this set almost everyday along with a couple of others I've recently purchased. All the parts are large enough not to swallow, and are cast with quite thick plastic. Additionally, the bed comes with an attached cloth blanket. The bed is large enough for both the Dad and Mom action figures (sold separately). Also, the hutch has a reflective mirror and both drawers open and close. I might add that several non amazon toy sellers are selling these things for over $14.00, which is quite a rip-off, considering the retail price for these. I purchased this through amazon for about $8.00. These may be out of circulation, so perhaps that explains the higher prices. I definitely recommend them, so long as they don't cost a fortune."
2,Do you like synth pop??????,"I know it seems like a good idea to buy this album because it's a rare, early Underworld, right??? Believe me, it's not a very good idea. This isn't techno, it's weird, silly, laughable synth pop directly from the closing credits of a back to the future movie. Believe me, i love Underworld, but this is not Underworld, at least not the Underworld that anyone likes. Karl Hyde dubbed the first version of Underworld ""Mach One"". Believe me, theres a reason that they weren't popular.."
1,Mistaken . . How bad can you get,"In one word. . . . . Crap.Like other reviewers already have said, it is not Underworld as we all like and know it.Collectors item . .? I do NOT think so."
2,"Under....NAH, that CAN'T be them","Whoah, this is HORRIBLE, sounds like some odd cross between The Cure and Depeche Mode...I gotta say that if this was the first bit of music I'd ever heard from Underworld I would have NEVER liked them. Get Dubnobasswithmyheadman....trust me, this IS NOT what they sound like!"
1,Is This The Same Band?,I bought this CD based on the first few reviews here on Amazon. The CD is a selection of horrible 80s music. I've never even let the songs play all the way through because they are so BAD. Think I paid something like $10 for it here on Amazon and now can't get rid of it for more than $3.25. Now that's a bad investment. Save your money unless you want to buy it from me dirt cheap.
3,"Avoid, IF YOU HAVE THE DVDS","What we have here are the Christmas episodes from seasons 2, 3, 5, and 6. All of which are on those seasons dvd sets. The extended secret Santa is on season 6 so it is not exclusive to this set. While these episodes are great and are usually the best part of the season there is no point in buying them if you already own the other dvd sets. I say even if you're a hardcore fan avoid buying it, however if you do not own any of the seasons and just want this for the xmas episodes it is worth picking up."
1,TASTES LIKE PLASTIC,This water distiller makes the water taste like plastic. I guess this company thinks that 'fresh clean sweet tasting water' tastes like plastic.. I don't know what I was thinking when I bought a water distiller with a plastic container..Plus when its running it heats up the whole kitchen.. great for winter.. not in the middle of summer...I guess it will be good in a survival situation.. if our water is tainted.. but still we would be drinking plastic water.. which in my mind wouldn't be much better for you..Oh well. I'm going to have to keep it cause its return date passed. We kept trying to distill in it.. in hopes that the plastic smell/taste would wear off after a few uses.. it helped a little bit.. but not much.
5,Great water!!,"I received the Water Wise Distiller as a Christmas gift in 2010. I use it for drinking water, cooking, and the humidifier in my CPAP. I thought the water were I life was pretty good... but I am amazed at what is left in the boiler every time I use it. I pour the contains of the pitcher into a second pitcher and my coffee maker water tank. That way I am ready to run another gallon thru the distiller as soon as I need it.I have not had any problems with my unit... It is easy to clean."
2,What's the Point?,"I really do not see the point of spending a lot of money and effort on a water distiller that empties itself into a plastic receptacle. The purpose of a distiller is to remove toxins and other impurities, and all available evidence indicates that there is a risk of reintroducing toxins into the water through the plastic storage container. Did the geniuses who designed this never think of using a glass or stainless steel storage jug?"
1,"AVOID ""SELLER"" HEALTHNUT ALTERNATIVES","Broke down after three months. The seller ""Healthnut Alternatives,"" did nothing to help. Maker of product then made us pay for the shipping for this very heavy, defective item. DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,"Defective Product, Poor Customer Service","I purchased this through Amazon from Healthnut Alternatives LLC. The product was defective, and they would not refund my money or pay for the repairs. VERY expensive to ship back for repairs. Poor customer service. Had to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. DO NOT BUY."
1,Do Not Buy From Waterwise!,"Waterwise has an awful customer service and does not stand by their products. I spent hundreds of dollars on this distiller just 4 years ago and it broke down twice, costing me 80 dollars each time for repair and shipping. The second time they actually sent it back broken and leaking. They did not agree to repair it for free after they made it worse.I am not giving them another cent, so it's going into the trash.I'll now buy one from another company. A while back their shower filter cracked on me after just 2 years and they wouldn't stand by that either. So I bought from another company.They don't value my business, so I am done with them."
1,Too heavy and doesn't look good,The jacket is too heavy and doesn't look good. It may be good for construction workers.
5,If you like Emmylou Harris buy this CD,"I must admit Emmylou Harris is the female country singeralong with Dolly Parton. Rodney Crowell was one ot theoriginal members of Emmylou's band and she recorded alotof his songs. Just look at the song list and you'll rememberEmmylou recording them on her classic Warner bros. alnums.Rodney Crowell is a great songwriter and this collection isfantastic-one good song after another. It is interesting to hear his versions of them. He sings them with such ease andall are simply produced. The back-up singers include RosanneCash, Emmylou Harris, Nicolette Larson. If you like good countrysongs then you will love this CD. He does a great job singingthem"
4,Too Bad More Early Crowell Isn't Around....,"But just to set the record straight, ""Queen of Hearts"" was written by Hank DeVito, a pedal steel ace who worked in Emmylou Harris's Hot Band after he finished playing tours with Elvis."
1,ANYPLACE Is A Great Place To Read!,"No no no! This author has the premise all wrong. Looking for a place to read and pointing out all the problems is not a good message to give early readers or pre-readers.As a mom and grandmother I want all my offspring and beyond to be happy to have a book anytime and anyplace, even in the most uncomfortable situations in the car next to the sister who is making weird noises.The story children find in a book takes them into a new place in their mind, and they are no longer in the wobbly chair or near the gurgling coffee pot. Though I give the author points for effort, with a flawed premise where can one go?"
3,sweet book,"I was looking for a first/baby book, this one is for someone a little older. I would read it to an older toddler - 3-4 years old. It's got a sweet premise, with a child looking for the best place to read, and engaging drawings. I just wanted a simpler book and ended up not giving this one as a gift, but donating it to my local school instead."
5,Good book,Reviewed by a five year old boy. I liked when he found a place to read. It was a good book
5,My wife enjoys watching this movie when unwinding from the days activities.,Even though she and I have watched several time it remains a favorite. The story is excellent. The goofy relative are a little overdone but enjoyable.
4,Light-hearted family fun,I wanted a copy of this movie because it has been enjoyed by numerous members of my family from teenagers to my 84 year old uncle. Just good clean fun and links the members of all generations!
5,Heart Warming,"This was a great movie for the whole family. Every boy should have Uncles like this, Caine and Duvall were eccentric without being sappy. I would see it again."
5,Second Hand Lions Blu-Ray,I first saw this movie over at my brother's house and I had never heard of it. Since then I have purchased the Blu-Ray version.I will not repeat the plot line as many have already done that. I will only say that this is one of the top 10 movies of this decade. Truly a sleeper hit of the century.5 stars
5,Wow (for sure),"I cannot understand why Amazon uses paid reviewers who are afraid to like the films they review and don't even bother to see many of them, as indicated by the errors of fact in the second quoted review. Make no mistake, folks, this is the real thing: a truly mesmerizing family film that is able to be humorous, scary, thrilling and inspiring - frequently all at the same time. How many years has it been since three generations of your family were able to repeatedly laugh and cheer loudly for a film? This is in the rare class of films that will go on and on, like Wizard of Oz, Shane, Dragonslayer, High Noon, Miracle on 34th Street, and a very few others, except that it is better than several of them. It is a film for all time and all ages. It is definitely not just a ""kid's picture"". Perhaps I am partial to ""modern legends."" I think we all are."
5,"If you don't buy many DVD's, buy this one","This one movie keeps finding its way into my Netflix queue, and I watch it through at least twice before I send it back - very atypical behavior for me.There's nothing quite as delightful as watching two old curmudgeon's adapt to having a kid dropped on them, and teaching that kid all manner of lessons - and learning a few themselves.Not to mention the delight of watching Robert Duvall and Michael Caine teach a bunch of teenage toughs about manners.It's kind of like ""Princess Bride"" - an under-rated 'classic' story that should be part of every rainy-day movie collection."
1,second hand lions,"I bought two dvds from red market or something like that. both of them were area 2 and will not play in the usa. I bought one and it would not work. I reordered anothe dvd and it wouln't work either. So I bought ""Second Hand Lions"" fromanother vender and it worked perfectly. I will never buy another dvd from you folks again.I f I could take that one star away I would. You need to fire red market because they are a bunch of crooks and they make amazon look like a bunch of chumps."
4,Too sugary for my taste but it did hold my interest,"I rented this 2003 DVD because it starred Michael Caine and Robert Duvall. They are fine actors and I knew I would see wonderful performances. I wasn't disappointed. They are cast as two eccentric uncles to Haley Joel Osmant and the whole film plays like a fairy tale.Supposedly the uncles have a lot of money stashed away and so they sit on their Texas farm all day chasing away salesmen. They tell tall tales about being in the foreign legion in Africa. The stories are full of romance and adventure but somewhat unbelievable. But that doesn't matter, because the boy and the uncles are getting to love and respect each other. Naturally there are conflicts. And, naturally, everything works out for the best.This is not my kind of story. It was too ""feel good"" and sugary. But the acting was so good and it held my interest and so I do recommend it. And I think it would be especially appealing for children over the age of 7."
3,Second Hand Lions,"This is a wonderful movie and I will watch many times! The DVD, however, seems defective and sticks in several places. I elected NOT to send it back, asking for a replacement. It just seemed to be too much of a hassle. The movie does continue after the period of hesitation."
5,Great Movie,"I saw this in the theater and when I saw it for $10 I thought I would buy it. The only problem is that yesterday I saw it in the clearance bin at WalMart for $5.00, Oh well its still a great movie."
3,Family Fun,"This is a wonderful, fun movie for the entire family. Good acting cast with a great story for people of all ages. It's funny and inventive. If you want a good chuckle here's a good one for you!"
5,Wonderful,"Wonderful story that brings family closer together. Although at times you couldn't tell if it was true or not, the stories were neat and told in great detail. Loved the cameo of Eric Balfour (Six Feet Under/Dr. Quinn). Overall--> You Should See This Movie!"
5,Two secondhand lions chew up the scenery,"Two of the great actors, Caine and Duval compliment one another perfectly in this wonderful tale of two old men come home to Texas to die. But you never pity these guys, in fact we admire them for their decision, a decision which is knocked aside by the arrival of some distantly related nephew( Hayley Joel Osmond). This young actor more than holds his own with these two masters turning in a stellar performance of a youth moving through adolescence. Great supporting performances, especially from the lion. This movie takes us through so many emotions, from laugh out loud to choking back a sob. It's a wonderful ride."
5,it remarkable how these too old guys made their millions and how they kept it away from their greedy family,"the lives of these two men is a really great story line and goes on when they reach their prime time in life all due to haley joel osment comming into their lives and giving them a second chance for life, just like the lion, the story holds my grand kids attention all the way threw the movie thats a plus because when they loose interest in a movie they just get up and leave it and get into trouble because i like it."
5,"Robert Duvall and Michael Caine, hilarious and loving mentors.","Love this movie. Two old codgers loving and taking care of a boy with so much love,compassion and life. Many lessons learned on this one."
5,Ten Stars!,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time! Wonderful message for young people and so realistic, yet fantastic, at the same time."
4,"Good, Fun, Feel-Good and Surprisingly Good Film","I ran into this film by accident on HBO and was instantly hooked. It turned out to be a surprisingly good film. It is a good family film, light, a little corny, but a feel-good film. You leave the film just feeling good. So rare these days for family films. In fact, some ""family"" films really push the envelope of decency and appropriateness for the sake of ""appealing"" to the audience, instead of telling a darn good story. Even animated family films these days push it.The story is a little fantastical - similar to ""Big Fish"" (2004) - and at times corny. But the corniness and the silliness makes the story light, enjoyable, and funny.This is a movie that is fun and worth watching."
5,Secondhand Lions,"The movie Secondhand Lions was recommended to me by someone who knows me well. They thought I would like it and I did very much. In fact, I thought they underrated it as it exceeded my expectations."
4,Very good family movie!,"This is a very good family movie. Robert Duvall has done it again. If you haven't seen it, go and buy it."
4,SECONDHAND LIONS,"This is a great old time simple comedy. No special effects, just darn good acting and good humour. Robert Duval & Michael Cane do a great job. I would rate this in my top five comedies."
5,Secondhandlionmmh,"This is a humurous movie, enjoable to the entire family. The interaction between characters is great, and there are plenty of unexpected surprises.The DVD arrived when promised and in good shape."
5,dvd,I heard of this movie through several friends. I love heart warming stories (movies). I ordered it at a great price through a reliable seller. It arrived as stated and were extremely pleased.
5,"Great movie for children, fun for adults","The story runs very much like a fairy tale. Only there is no father, the mother is the wicked one in a very modern way (highly narcissistic) and the scary grumpy old uncles turn out to the be the heroes in every way. A great movie for generations to watch together."
5,my new favorite movie of all time,"The Wizard of Oz has always been my favorite movie of all time, then the Empire Strikes Back. This one does not replace my favs but is put on the same shelf. anyone that does not like it probably has schizo/psycho issues reminiscent of the unsubs of Criminal Minds or is over-evaluating it for what it is, a great film."
5,SHL,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It brings together lifes issues and fantasy. Alllwing someone to revisit childhood while empowering them to believe in sonething larger than themselves. Highly recommended.
5,a feel good movie,this was a real cute family movie. One that I think didn't get the publicity to the public that it should have.
4,Great movie,A great movie about a boy lied to by his mother. He discovers a whole new world living with his 2 old and grumpy uncles. Highly recommended!
3,"Terrible shipping quality, and the transfer is okay at best.","The movie is good, although the transfer has LOTS of grain, and some shots are almost unwatchable, it's obvious that the film wasn't taken great care of which is unfortunate, also the case arrived with massive cracks, so big that pieces of plastic just fell off from the case."
5,Can't Help But Love This Story,"Love this movie about a young boy who builds a lasting love and respect for the two uncles who raise him. All three lives are given purpose by the bonds that are formed. The mother is totally self-involved..glad she left, so her son was able to have a better life with his uncles. Great ending to the story."
1,Secondhand Lions,"I got notice from supplier that USPS returned shipment due to wrong address. However, the address listed was correct. I requested re-shipment. Two weeks later, I am still waiting. Supplier's website will not accept my inquiries."
1,Secon Hand Lions.,Very good movie and was ordered for my husband's birthday. He was delighted. And I am always pleased with the service provided by Amazon.
1,Wore Out Secondhand Lions,I love the movie but this DVD does not load most of the time and if it does it pauses through whole the movie.
1,Secondhand Lions,"This is the third or fourth dvd that I have obtained through amazon, and the first one with quality problems. There are a couple of areas in the dvd where skips appear. If I had bought this dvd at a local store I would have returned it for replacement.As to delivery, no problem."
5,Secondhand is First Rate,"This is a very sweet, funny and entertaining movie. The acting was top-notch, the storyline interesting and well developed.I don't agree with other reviewers that the final scene should have been cut--the line by the little Middle Eastern boy at the end brings the entire story full circle and makes an important statement about Arab-American relations. The scene closes the story and is not, in my opinion, simply put in to be P.C.-but please see it yourself and decide.Highly recommended.NOTE: there are some short but disturbing scenes of child abuse near the end-be prepared to discuss it if you are seeing the movie with younger children."
5,LIONS truly is the king of the jungle!,"An outstanding film! So what if some people say it's syrupy? Movies that are now classics used to be that way, & no one cared. Perhaps we've just gotten more cynical, & we need more films like this. Duvall & Caine are perfect, & Osmond matches them, all three fitting their characters like gloves.An outstanding film that only proves just because one is getting up there in years, you don't have to get old."
3,A bit mature,"I was surprised by the language in this film. We were going towatch it with our 10-year old daughter, but the language is a bit strong for young children in my opinion."
4,Charming,"Secondhand Lions is a unique, charming, and mostly wholesome film that the whole family can enjoy. Not too easy to find a movie like that coming out these days. The story is about a teenage boy whose irresponsible mother drops him off at two distant uncles' house for a summer. The boy has never met the two old codgers (Michael Caine and Robert Duvall) and they get off on an uneasy footing. The boy tries to find out about his uncles' mysterious past - are they really criminals sitting on a treasure on their land, as some say? Or are they adventurers extraordinaire?The film deals with some tough life issues in a non-syrupy, non-sacchariney way. And there is a lion, an adorable lion named Jasmine. Delightful drawings at the end credits by Berkley Breathed, creator of Bloom County, are a treat."
5,Another great movie by McCanlies,Another great follow up to Dancer. Loved this movie as well. It's one I keep watching over and over and I always enjoy it.
3,I see fascinating old people!,"Secondhand Lions is a family friendly movie starring a superb cast of Robert Duvall, Michael Caine, and Haley Joel Osment - of I See Dead People fame. A boy gets dumped with his uncles my his mom for duo reasons of, 1. so mom can go to Las vegas and party her life away, and 2. So her son can learn where the uncles have hidden their fortune.Most of the movie is the interaction and growing relationship between the boy and his mysterous and interesting uncle. He is told a tail of great adventure, which he may believe in or not believe in. There is also a love story involving uncle Hub.There is not cursing, nudity, simulated sex or spurting blood, so this movie is family safe.This is a 3 star, good, movie that makes you smile and feel good. The way the adventure and love story are laid out reminded me a little of Princess Bride, which is a WOW 5 star movie. If you don't own Princess bride, buy it now. As for Secondhand Lions, rent it first."
5,Secondhad Lions,Love this movie. I have watched it several times. I love the people who play in it as well. It is a must see movie. Once you see it you will fall in love with it & watch it several times over.
5,A Must Have for you Collection!,"If ever there was a an outstanding family video this is it, it captivates and entertains and tugs as all the right heart strings. It's a keeper!!!"
5,I love this movie,This is one of my all time favorite movis ever. There is alot of language. Perfect price.
5,Good family movie,This is a movie I would let my nieces and nephews watch without worrying if they are going to have nightmares.
5,Delightfully adventuresome yet poignantly portrayed,"A couple of bored, rich bachelors with the highlight of their day shooting at salesman callers are surprised with a summer drop-off – their 12 year old nephew. Seems mama is a victim of bad choices in her life and her son ends up on the short end of her experiences. What looks like the start of yet another one has a delightful twist as uncles and nephew each play out the hand they are dealt. Woven in the story are flashbacks to the uncles’ former glory days which include the mysterious “Jasmine”, lecherous relatives looking for a rumor of money and mama’s sleazy new beau. Even the once forbidden salesmen add to the creative mix selling them seeds (are we farmers now?), a real jungle lion and – well, to tell you more is to spoil the movie! Truly a keeper, a re-watch and family flick."
3,"Good, could have been great",Understand that my 3 star rating on a film is pretty good since 90% of what I see is either 2 or 1 star at best. This is a fine movie. What kept it from being great was the director and the editor. I wanted more interaction between the kid and his uncles to justify his deep feeling for them at the end. Another ten minutes focusing on that aspect would not have made it too long and it would have taken it to another level. And the greedy family that drops in could have been jettisoned entirely without notice. You've got 2 of the best actors of our time in the lens and what I wanted was more of their daily lives and philosophies that intrigues the young boy so much. Of course I realize that all I'm asking for may very well have ended up on the editing room floor and that would be a terrible shame to know. Yet I highly recommend this film for all families to enjoy. It's decent enough for kids without insulting their intelligence.
4,Love the ending,"An engaging story well-told and well-acted. The story-within-the-story keeps you guessing, and the ending satisfies. Over the years, Robert Duvall evolved from character actor to one of the finest, most subtle lead actors in the business. He's great in this. Watching Michael Caine do a Texas accent was fun, too (he pulls it off). However, while Haley Joel Osment has an emotional scene or two that are convincing, overall this is probably his worst work. He rarely seems comfortable or convincing. But his role doesn't carry enough weight to pull down the production. It's a fun romp. Special Features include an enlightening saga of the script's journey from page to screen."
4,What a nice surprise!,"I found this little gem while casting around for a downloadable movie last weekend. I thought it would be ""OK"" based on the trailer, but it turned out that everyone in the family liked it! My 7 year old found it particularly interesting that a little boy could choose to live with someone other than his mother...the thought had never occurred to him before, and it made for an interesting discussion!"
5,Secondhand Lions,"What a great flick! It has everything in it (comedy, mystery, romance. . . the only thing that might be missing is the Mother Ship)! I first saw this movie on a satellite channel and knew that I had to have it in my collection. I am now sharing it with half of America."
5,Great Family Movie,I have seen this movie before and purchased it to watch with the extended family over Thanksgiving. The younger kids (ages 7-13) and the adults really enjoyed it.
5,Love the movie,I bought this video because my original one stopped working. I definitely like to have it in my collection so I can watch whenever the mood strikes.
5,Secondhand Lions,"I bought Secondhand Lions from Haley Joel Osment, and received it in three days. I can't tell you how wonderful this movie was.Thank You,Phyllis"
5,Freeway movie for anyone.,"This movie is moving, funny and inspiring. Both the old and young characters in this movie "" come of age"" in this engaging film. Just believe."
4,A great movie,"If you haven't seen it, it is well worth the purchase. I don't know anyone who didn't really enjoy this great movie."
4,Entertaining movie,"I really liked this movie. Its a movie you can watch with the whole family. I liked the story,it has a different meaning for each person who sees it. Its refreshing to watch something that is not violent."
4,Classic Male Heroes for a PC World,"What a great movie! Duvall and Caine are excellent examples of what classic, American men are all about. Unabashedly male, tend to business, like women (and ""...can fall in love with a passion you can't imagine.""), and know right from wrong even if life deals one a bad hand. This is a movie about compassion, tenderness, courage, and kick-in-the-pants humor. Granted, there is a bit of excessive stereotyping, but it's within the context that challenges the politically correct roles currently being jammed down the throats of boys in public schools all over the country. Dare one say it? The mother in this story is a quintessential loser. No, she doesn't use drugs or rob banks. She isn't a victim of males. She simply lacks the gumption to make something of her life and protect her son from the creeps she hooks up with.This isn't a perfect movie by any means. With a theme like this it's a miracle it was ever made"
3,Not bad for a soppy type of film,"This film is ok with good acting and some unusual pets but a bit too much on the tear jerking side for my liking, though the missis and the daughter liked it. But what I want to know is what happens to the pig?It starts off following the dogs about all the time and in the end it goes missing. Does the lion eat it? I think it must have, but because its a family film they dont show it happen.Perhaps all will be revealed when they release the X rated directors uncut version."
1,Secondhand Lions,"I sent this as a gift to my sister, Betty Eldridge, and she advised me that the CD was flawed. It would stick in the middle of the show and not move forward. I won't be ordering any more CD's because I hated sending a flawed gift."
1,Highly recommended,"Movie was highly recommended to me. Unfortunately, the DVD disc 1 did not play on any dvd player or computer we tried it on. Disc 2 with deleted scenes skipped repeatedly. Never got to watch it. Would cost more than original cost to ship it back so ordering another copy."
5,I laughed. I cried. I fell down.,"'Second Hand Lions' has it all. It's got adventure, comedy, romance, introspection, self discovery, and the best pair of cranky codgers since 'Grumpy Old Men.' Faced with contradictory pictures of his uncles (are they bank robbers, or heroic adventurers?), a young boy must decide which version to believe. And in the process, he must decide what he believes in, and what he values in life. At turns, this movie is funny, exciting, touching, and profound. It reminds us that there are some things worth believing in, whether they happen to be true or not.Jeff Edwards, Author of ""Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller"""
4,Worth watching.....,"The movie is cute, and has some great stuff in there. It is family friendly (with the exception of two lines from Duvall's charactor). My only complaint is the relationship between the Uncle's and Walter could have been developed slightly more. Great movie though...."
5,What a great movie!,"Either you get it or you don't. I get it, and so do most of the others who reviewed it here. You don't need special effects and explosions to tell a great story, as this movie proves. Definitely a keeper!"
4,Secondhand Lions Review,"This film is great for everyone - young and old. It's funny but has a few sad moments, and some action (without the use of lots of special effects). I laughed (everytime) and cried (at least the first time). It's a wonderful film!"
5,Simply 5 stars!,"This movie is best described as Simply Five stars! A great family movie, but really it is so much more! Watch it!"
5,Must see. It will warm your heart.,Great entertainment for the entire family. I bought several copies to give as gifts. Quality acting with a well written story. Like Princess Bride exciting enough for all ages.
5,This was a good movie for my grandchildren to watch.,I bought this for my grandchildren to watch. They liked it very much. Some of it was a little over their heads.
4,Nothing Seccond Hand About It,"Secondhand Lions is a story about living life, about how a male role model or in this case models can affect the life of young men and about learning how to be a ""real"" lion. Michael Caine is brilliant in his supporting role as one of two 'retired' bachelor great uncles who have a secret past. Robert Duvall is the other. They suddenly find themselves the recipients of Walter, played by Haley Joel Osment, who is dumped on them by his irresponsible, dam. The two provide a touch of the comic and at the same time a strong male role model to the boy.My boys love the story and it is one of the few we watch together."
5,Second Hand Lions is the Best Family Movie I have Seen,"Second Hand Lions is not only a funny, heart warming movie, it is the best family movie I have ever seen. It Does a great job of showing the importance of family relationships, and growing up with positive influence. I am 53 years old and have seen a lot of movies, when I want to watch something that restores my faith in families and shows truly good people, I watch this movie. Haven't watched more than several dozen times over the last couple years."
5,We need more feel-good films like this!,"It's all too rare nowadays when a movie of this caliber comes to the big screen. Duval and Caine were in their element in this film, and it was a pleasure to see Haley Joel Osment in yet another fine performance. This film was a perfect choice for him; it was a nice bridge between the young child roles he had done and the young adult roles that I'm sure will be forthcoming. The humor was great without having to resort to sex and vulgarity; and the serious scenes gave it a nice balance without being too melodramatic. It is a film that you can watch with the whole family, and everyone can enjoy it. I hope there are more like it coming, I may go to the movies more than I have (3 times in the last year)."
4,Totally cool,cool family flick. boy is sent to live on uncles texas ranch. uncles cool they have guns. boy adopts pet lion toally cool. cool movie cool people about lions uncles and guns.
3,OK FAMILY FILM,"Aging rural Texan brothers Michael Caine and Robert Duvall are the SECONDHAND LIONS (New Line) who take in their 14 year old great nephew Haley Joel Osment for a summer. But are the eccentric, wild, free-spirited uncles' tall tales real or are they meant to cover a dreadful life of robbing banks? Kind of sappy and contrived but still fun and full of visual invention. Caine and Duvall effortlessly do their thing and Osment is believable as a boy who learns valuable lessons while having the summer adventure of his life. Not the great film the screenwriter assumes in his commentary and interview, but an OK entry in the increasingly rare family film category."
1,Second Hand Lions,"I was very disappointed to receive a VHS instead of a DVD, as I ordered a DVD. I haven't even been able to give the VHS away as no one I know has a VHS player. I believe I requested a DVD. I am not anxious to order fron Amazon.com again. This was the first order, and it was not correct."
3,Fluff for the whole family,"I got caught up in the enthusiasm when I should have known that this family-friendly fluff was not for me. Maybe it deserves five stars if approached in the spirit of ""Hey, let's all go to a movie! Mom, grandpa, you twins, everybody!"" There is such a thing as freshness and charm, even in family movies, and I thought maybe this one had it. Really, it didn't, although it wasn't awful. If you are are at all a mature, thoughtful moviegoer, you should pass on this one, unless you are just out to amuse the rug-rats."
1,WANTED TO RATE IT NO STARS AT ALL,"The video that was ordered took too long to arrive, Once it did arrive it turned out to be from the United Kingdom and COULD NOT BE VIEWED on USA players. It is unbelievable that any company would knowingly mail a product that could not be used to a USA address,especially when they could have contacted the purchaser and explained the situation. We were most unhappy with this company and will never order from them again."
1,Two Old men and a boy,"Great movie - two old coots find themselves caring for a young boy whose parents have died - they live in a battered old house out in the middle of nowhere - the growth between all of them is awesome - and very, very funny. Good for all ages. We showed it to a group of over 50's who were at our house for a St. Patricks' Day party - enjoyed by all."
1,Secondhand Lions (spanish subtitles),"The information that Amazon provides is incorrect, this title does not have spanish subtitles, I have returned this tilte two times and Amazon can't send me the right version of this title."
4,Fun Family Film,"Again, I run into a problem with amazon's rating system. This movie was better than 'OK' (three stars), so I give it four - but then it lumps itself in with other films I've given four stars, and this one wasn't quite as good (i.e., He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not). So, I'd say three and half stars, which rounds up to four in this case. Why? Well, the ending was a little sappy. I guess it was intending to show that the stories were valid, but it seemed a little forced. Also, Osment has officially entered the awkward stage - get ready for lots of squeaky exclamations! On the plus side would be flawless performances from Caine/Duvall, lots of clean action, and some wonderful artwork from Berkeley Breathed."
5,Really Great,"I stumbled onto this movie by accident and boy am I glad I did! What a great movie for the whole family. It has a bit of everything, saddness, happiness, and great humor. Do buy it. You'll love it!"
4,BEST WHOLESOME FAMILY MOVIE SINCE 'HOLES' OR 'FINDING NEMO',"This movie is a rare find. It is a delightful family film with real actors instead of animation. Superb casting, a semi-nostalgic theme, humor without vulgarity. The characters are real, and they unfold through a story that is unique. Touching without being radically sentimental.Other reviewers here are too busy noting that Haley is growing up and that Michael isn't a Texan to appreciate the overall effect of this movie. Yes, it has a couple of flaws here and there. Haley is actually the catalyst, not the star. The story is presented through his eyes, how he saw the uncles and their world. He is in awe because it is a very different world than his. Caine and Duvall make a wonderful pair.Both kids and grown-ups can truly enjoy this comedy, not the slapstick kind but one that stems from the idiosynchrasies of character. I could see it perhaps 2-3 times without getting bored. Highly recommended for a great family outing!"
5,One of my top 10,"I do not own many DVDs due to space limits and the fact that there are very few worth watching again. I own Secondhand Lions! I have had to buy it more than a few times as I lent it out and it did not come back. the story is fantastic and the acting is better. My favorite line (without giving too much away) is the very last.""Yeah, they really lived!"""
5,Enjoyable family movie. Shows you what outstanding actors these gentlemen are.,Story is delightful. Acting by all is excellent. An example of REAL talent at all age levels. I seldom purchase a movie since I'm not one for seeing a movie more than once. This is an exception along with Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.
3,ENTERTAINING,"THIS IS A ""FEEL GOOD"" MOVIE. ALL THE ACTORS ARE FAVORITES OF MINE AND IT WAS A LOVELY STORY. VERY GOOD MOVIE OF A YOUNG BOY'S PASSAGE TO MANHOOD."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"The last time I wrote a review of a movie I was in college and it was an English assignment! This movie was a pleasant surprise from the get-go. The story revolves around a 14-year old who is dropped off at his great uncles home in Texas; he's never met nor heard of them but his mother deserts him to go off and pursue other interests. The pairing of Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, and Haley Joel Osment was a real treat. Caine and Duvall play brothers who may have lived somewhat far-fetched and fantastic lives. Along the way they manage to capture young Walter's heart (Haley Joel Osment) and he theirs. Walter teaches the brothers about kids and they teach him about growing up and life. I'm not sure what I expected from this film but I laughed almost from the beginning. The movie has a PG rating but it is a wonderful choice for the entire family to see."
5,Second Hand Lion,"totally outstanding movie that will make you laugh, cry and everything in between - a rare family movie; suitable for movie night at home!"
4,Osment's a little annoying but Caine and Duvall save it...,"A touching story about Walter played by Haley Joel Osment who goes to live with his ""rough around the edges"" uncles Hub and Garth played by Robert Duvall and Micheal Caine. I especially enjoyed the gruff nature and ""devil may care"" antics of the two men who in the beginning, really don't seem to like Walter. Thankfully, Duvall and Caine keep Osment's annoying character from becoming overbearing and the mixture between the two is excellent."
4,Upside down at 90 in the barn,Sometimes there really is buried treasure at the end of thestory about the mad uncles. In this case the treasurewas their stories about the French foreign legionand Africa. A boy with a less than truthful motherfinds not one but two father figures in his great uncles.I really enjoyed this movie and the lion Jasmine.
4,Excellent entertainmnet,"I have seen this movie several times and enjoyed it completely. In fact, so much so, I've chosen to give it as a gift."
5,An all time favorite,"I never tire of watching this movie. It has a wonderful story, great actors and beautiful visuals. It really tells an enchanting story. They don't make many like this any more."
3,Not much crochet and not so easy,"I bought this book because I am a new knitter and an experienced crocheter. I was looking for some patterns for crochet toys or easy knits. This has neither.That said, there are some very cute and fun patterns. While the fair isle for the ears is a bit complicated (and not at all easy) for the newish knitter, the pig on the cover of the book is a fast project and worth the effort! I am in the middle of the dinosaur for my daughter and am looking forward to making the adorable penguins and polar bear.If you are an experienced knitter, this is a nice book for making special and unique gifts. If you are looking for crochet patterns, keep looking."
2,Beware the title!,"I am so sick of publishers putting out books that say ""Knit and crochet"" then throw in very little (and very stupid) crochet patterns! This ""And crochet"" is TWO patterns. And they are just crocheted yo-yo's put together to make a snake and a clown. If you don't knit, don't buy this at all!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good Toy Box But Needs Protective Coating,This toy box is great. Easy to put together. But it needs to have a transparent sealer or other protective coating sprayed on it. Mine came chipped and scraped from the poor packing. The paint flakes off once it is chipped. It can be remedied with a little lacquer. Thought it would be better and more durable.
5,Niemeyer looks back,"Niemeyer looks back in a non-linear fashion at his life, which spans most of the 20th century. He talks about his friendships with presidents, musicians, radicals, architects and drunkards, stressing the things that made them most human. A good read, not only for architecture fans but for anyone who is interested in Brazil. The translator includes detailed footnotes explaining the names, places and buildings. I found it surprising to find out what a Bohemian Niemeyer is and the delight he has in telling stories of adventures with his pals in Brazilian brothels. He mentions Henry Miller as one of his favorite writers and at times the influence is evident (although Niemeyer is too classy to go into sordid detail). A poignant read by an atheist who knows the end is near and is admitedly afraid of death, who values family and friendship above art."
5,Amongst the hidden gems in Duke's career-,"This film is still ahead of it's time,today.What a surprise it was for me one day,long ago,to sit down in front of this movie and find myself enjoying it as much as I did,and still do.A quiet masterpiece,I must agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned how mature the approach is here.If you love The Duke and haven't seen this film,do it now.You'll enjoy yourself so much.It works on so many levels,this movie is one of those for which the phrase-""They don't make 'em like they used to..."" applies so well.Understated,intelligent,good-humored and sweet,all at the same time.A Classic waiting for Time to discover it."
4,I like this movie,"I thought this was a very good movie. It was different having John Wayne as a football coach instead of a cowboy. I reccomend this movie to people who like John Wayne movies, and to people who like older movies.The reason why I watch these movies is because my family likes them so I watch them to."
4,Spirit Along the Way,"Football Coach John Wayne and College Rector Charles Coburn combine in an underrated, light comedy which defines liberal arts under religious auspices. The values of both men are profound; the flaws, transient. Purpose transcends both plot and budget as the heroes struggle for ideals, make mistakes, and begin again. Their stories reflect the human condition of all who strive maturely. You can define life by people like this. There is response to grace in them. And its warming fire reaches out finally to all who perceive. Definitely worth seeing!"
3,"""Trouble Along the Way"", an average early John Wayne movie","This movie is about tiny St. Anthony's college,and Father Burke who feels that a winning football team will make the school profitable. They bring in a new coach, Steve Williams, (John Wayne)to do the job. Williams has been banned fro the major conferences and is making ends meet as an oddsmakers, when St. Anthony's calls. He must build a winning team and fast.Williams comes with his young daughter, whom Williams must prove to a Children's Court officer (Donna Reed) that he's a fit parent. You can guess as the movie goes along, questions come up about the football teams inprovement, and Williams problems with the Court officer. All turns out right in the end with the predictable ending with Wayne and Reed falling in love.All in all not a bad movie, if you like old movies."
3,Trouble Along the Way,"It's alright, but not one of my favorites. We don't watch it very often. I'm not real big on John Wayne."
5,Trouble Along the Way,"John Wayne, that's all you need to say. I love this movie. It's funny,warm and entertaining. I also love Donna Reed. She another actress who brings ther characters she plays alive."
4,Effective but it hurts!,"This thing really takes some getting used to. It is true that your legs are smooth and regrowth is slower. But, boy does it hurt the first few times. I have sensitive skin, so it may not be so bad for everyone, but the first time I used this product, I only got about 1/4 of a leg done before I had to stop. The more you use it, the easier it becomes, though."
2,Bent bumper,"Great looking bumper, but that's it! Second ride with it I hit a tree going about 5 mph and it cracked at the weld must have been a real bad weld job"
3,good tv,"I just got this TV last week. It has 16:9 feature same as Sony wega. Document that comes with is horrible! I couldn't find any information about this feature as if it isn't a big deal. I know that it is a matter of pressing the button but it would be nice if there is some document about it. So when I first use this feature, 16:9 mode there are 2 black bars on top and the bottom, so far so good. But when I pop in any of my DVD movies, it has 2 more black bars on top of the first 2 black bars. So I have double black bars on top of one another. Picture is great but all movies looks like shooting with 2:35:1 panavision camera, doesn't make sense! I got this TV mainly for gaming and movie watching and it has enough RAC jack for all the systems I own, 1 component, 1 S-VHS, and 2 more audio video input plus extra audio jacks for audio receiver. Great buy none the less."
5,$79.00 at home depot,"I love Amazon.com but I have relied on all of you for advice and your experience with a tool. No doubt this Palm nailer is a must buy, I've had mine for over a year and love it...."
4,Nylabone Rhino Rope Tug Toy,All I have to say is the ball survived! I have two English Bulldogs puppies and they are heavy chewers. This rope didn't last long but the ball is great and they still like it for a toy. In all fairness our dogs destroy ropes pretty quickly so I'd recommend this toy for a less aggressive chewer.
3,Rope shreds quickly but the rubber ball is awesome!,"My female Beagle is a sweetheart, but she is also ""The Destroyer"" when it comes to dog toys. The rope on this was shredded in less than 30 minutes. By one hour she had it completely destroyed and I pulled the remains from the ball.Now then, the rubber ball is great! It is very rugged, and it goes wild when it lands after being tossed and my dog just loves it like mad!I think Nylabone Co should make a dog tug toy with a 'rope' made of the same rubber material as the ball. Then I think my little destroyer would have a much longer lasting toy. :)"
2,Not for power chewer,I boght the football and ball shape at a local discount store (ocean state). The ball shaped one held up for about a week before showing damage which is pretty good for my dog but football had a sizeable chunky fopping around ready to break off in a matter of minutes.
4,"Love the Football, but the Rope didn't last...","I love Nylabone products because they are one of the only ones that don't get destroyed by my male Golden of just over a year..He loves this, but the rope went the first day..I purchased more rope at the hardware store, but that didn't last either..so it's just the football now:)...He likes it, but he loves chewing on the rope...I still like the product, but I wish the rope was sturdier.."
5,Great service!,I ordered this CD for my Aunt for Christmas. It was delivered in perfect condition and she enjoyed listening to it on her way home Christmas Day. Thanks for the great service.
4,efficient service,I was well satisfied with the speed of delivery of this(and another CD that I had ordered at the same time)item. Also I am always very well satisfied with the packaging of this and other items I have ordered.
4,"Excellent CD, but some good hits were left off","This is a great CD of one of the great female country groups of the eighties and nineties. The only problem I have with it is that some very good hits were left off. Hits like ""Lyin' In His Arms Again"", ""Mama's Never Seen Those Eyes"", and ""Men"". My feeling is that if you are going to make a ""greatest hits"" CD, please, make sure that all of your hits are on there before you include songs that were not really ""great"" hits, like ""Don't You"""
4,Works pretty well!,"It's hard to rate this item as I used it in conjunction with other mosquito repellent products. However, it's very simple and the smell isn't overpowering. I continue to use it on an ongoing basis while we are outside. I would buy one again."
5,A REAL WAR OF THE WORLDS,"I have previously read UNDERGROUND ALIEN BASES by Commander X and enjoyed it, but this book goes much further. Branton claims not only have the greys established their own bases but they have taken over already existing military bases after having fought a bloody battle in Dulce, NM. There is a lot of action in this book and I lot of information I hadnt seen anywhere else before. Branton gets his information from various sources so there is some degree of verifcation in his claims. I only wish what he says in DULCE WARS wasnt true!"
3,Entertaining.....but hard to swallow,"If you're interested in the subject of the book, then you'll enjoy reading this. Branton does a weave a disturbing story. Alien invasions, abductions, advanced technology, cover-ups/conspiracies, etc. While a good portion of the book is hard to swallow, the are some interesting points that will make you go hmmmm..... I wasn't disappointed, but I agree with the other reviewers, take with a grain of salt. Its more enjoyable if you check you disbelief at the door."
5,Eye Opener,"The Dulce Wars by Branton was an eye opener for me. I've researched many top secret military bases throughout the United States ranging from Area 51 to S4. The Dulce Base is definitely the most interesting of them all. Read the book with an open mind and take from it what you like. There is a lot of creditable people who come out talking about this top secret base. If you believe we all live in a perfect world with rainbows. This isn't a book for you. But, if you seek the truth this book may help you connect some dots. Enjoy!"
1,dreadful,I should have read the customer reviews before I bought this... Curiosity cost me [money amount]I could have spent to more advantage elsewhere. All the screaming in CAPS and no clear links between so called source quotes and the author's next stream of ... conjecture didn't help much either. Truly abysmal.
4,Family oriented novel from Jack Bickham,"Bickham writes different types of Fiction. I was introduced to him by an aunt who sent me a book from the Brad Smith Tennis series. He also writes family oriented books that sometimes have a pet involved. ""Dinah..."" is the latter type. A boys father loses a hand in a Railroad accident. The fictional RR sends him to a town which is probably in WV. The time is not specified, but since automobiles and Street cars are available I'd guess the time is early in the 20Th Century. The pet involved is a pigeon that the main scharacter rescues and trains. The family is a strong one, with the Mother especially so. I think a lot of readers will be reminded of thir own mother, as I was. There is Union trouble in the small RR town, which is the main point of emphasis. The ending is a little far fetched, but it leaves you with a warm feeling. If you liked Bickham's superb ""Baker's Hawk"", I think you will enjoy ""Dinah Blow Your Horn""."
4,Great book for intermediate scrappers,"I picked this book up when I first started scrapping. I have to say it was a bit overwhelming at first. However once I sat down and went through it page by page I really was pleased with my purchase! It has interesting pages,great layouts(especially the ""your photos three ways"")and the ""how to"" on the techniques were easy to follow. I have since purchased several more of the Creating Keepsakes books and have loved every one of them. A must have for a beginner!"
3,Scrapbook Techniques needed,"I loved the idea of this book, however when I received it, I was a little disappointed that there wasn't enough of a variety of different scrapbooking ideas - such as pictures of a variety of layouts, utilizing types of embellishments, and tools etc."
4,Scrapbook Tips & Techniques,I really like this book. Lots of good ideas. Someone I don't know saw what I was reading and we had a 10 min. conversation over creating our pages or going digital--she does that a lot. I think I still like to create my own pages at this point. I also have Digital Scrapbooking for Dummies so after I look some more at that I may start to sway the other way--who knows!! I'll probably end up combining the 2 for different occasions. What fun!!
1,lasted 6 weeks,"After about 6 weeks of owning this printer, I can't get it to print properly. From the troubleshooting guide, it appears the print head already needs replacing. Not exactly worth the cheap price if this is only as long as it lasts."
2,Paper Feed,"For the price this printer does OK printing, but the paper feed is very poor. Every time I need to print something, I have to manually force each piece of paper into the paper roller."
1,Keep Looking,"I wouldn't buy this thing on a bet ! It is obviously defective by nature, there is a reason for the cheap price, and I see several different reviews, stating the exact same thing...it just STOPS WORKING after a certain amount of time, and that's whether you use it daily, or let it sit for 3 months ! Brand new or used, Canon should be ashamed to even market such an inferior product, or at least give you a warning that it is DISPOSABLE ! I got so frustrated with mine (i250) I literally smashed it to pieces, as I was enraged, that a product that I used for about a month, would not work, after I didn't use it for 2 months ! Avoid this garbage, spend a little extra, save yourself a LOT of aggravation."
2,Not worth the money,"Very disappointed after reading the raving reviews. The paper feed skews the paper, very noisy and takes twice as long to get started to print than my Lexmark Z52. I used it in a home setting and ran thru both ink tanks in a week - no wonder they are cheaper than ink jets. Has problems feeding envelopes with out jamming. The printer has two buttons on top but only one is describe in the manual. It does make nice photos and was easy to install."
1,you don't always get what you pay for,"After using this printer for almost two years, I am sadly disappointed in the fact that the color cartridge has only worked for the first 6 months. Since then, I have been unable to get the color option to work.The black cartridge works great but for almost 50.00, I expected a bit more"
1,Do not buy this if you are on Mac OSX Panther,Do not get this if you are running OSX 10.3.2 Panther it will not work it a wast of time and money
4,ink wells,I think this printer is ideal for me to work from home & do webpage design. I cannot figure how to put ink in when it has run dry though.Anybody explain it to me please?
2,Lousy images,"This thing is pathetic, but then, you get what you pay for so I can't complain too much. The print quality is grainier than my previous printer, an HP930C. I thought that since it had been a couple of years, printer quality would have improved and prices would have gone down, but this little can of junk is a perfect example of being ""too good to be true"". I wouldn't even hang these prints on my refrigerator."
2,Halt... make sure of what you are buying,"Okay. I was searching for a printer.. I got on Amazon.com my favorite site for information... this site said that this printer could be used on windows 95.. I literally ran out and bought one at 9:00 pm.. the box didn't have '95 on it but I thought that Amazon.com had useful information. I got it home. I had trouble loading it. Now after buying this thing and staying up ALL night and spending half a day today doing a diagnostic on my machine..I can't get this printer to work. It's on my system but the system doesn't recongize a USB can someone help? ugg. Now, I have to call Canon..(and oh '95 drivers are not available on the web!).. help. It's cute printer; sounds great; looks nice on my desk but I can't get it to work. (miclmarin@aol.com)"
4,SYNAGOGUE,"This is a wonderful book, full of perfectly realized images and interesting text. For whatever reason synogogues in the U.S. often are designed in quite daring styles. It is intriguing to observe how each congregation says a bit about themselves in the building style they chose for their synagogue. I expecially like the spectacular Temple Emanuel in New York City, it is simple breathtaking, though I liked something about all of these buildings. I highly recommend this book; for someone not that familiar with the Jewish faith or synagogues in general it is quite enlightening."
2,Disappointed!!,"This was my first electirc shaver and I haven't liked the experience. The primary motivation for buying this shaver was to save time in the morning and get a closer shave without damaging the skin. Except for getting a closer shave, it takes much longer to shave with the electric shaver and skin get very red. The shaver is totally not suitable for shaving on soft skin like that near the neck. It takes almost twice the time to shave than it does with an ordinary razor. It does not work well when your hair has grown for 3-4 days."
3,NOT SO AUTOMATIC,"I THOUGHT WHAT A GREAT IDEA: WASH OUT THE MESS OF WHISKERS AND CLEAN THE RAZOR. WRONG! AFTER ABOUT THREE MONTHS I TOOK IT APART TO CHANGE THE LOTION BAG AND THE CUTTERS WERE A MESS. I CAN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT I HAD BEEN DOING (ONLY MORE OFTEN-ONCE A MONTH AS THE BOOK SAYS) FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS IE: TEAR IT DOWN, BRUSH ALL PARTS OFF, PUT IN A SHALLOW DISH, POUR ON ALCOHOL, THEN DRY ON TISSUE, REASSEMBLE, PUT DROP OF MACHINE OIL ON HEADS AND RUB ON PALM OF HAND FOR A FEW MINUTES. I DON'T THINK THE HEADS ARE DULL, JUST CRAPPED UP AND PROBABLY SLOWED DOWN, WHICH MADE MY NECK RED. USED AQUA VELVA FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS, BEFORE THAT MY FATHER'S OLD SPICE AND REMINGTON."
5,"Smooth, close shave","This Norelco shaver replaces a two year old Remington wet/dry rotary shaver that was remarkable for its cheap construction. I had grown used to the comfort of a wet shave but had sworn off Norelco shavers due to their relatively high cost until I found this one. At $64.99, this Norelco has to be the best deal going. It dispenses self-contained Nivea lotion that results in a smooth, close and burn-free shave. Cleaning is a snap..just rinse under hot running water. There is a ""deluxe"" model available (#5655X) but I doubt the additional $80 is going to result in a better shave. This is a great combination...traditional Norelco quality, the comfort of a wet shave and a super price. It includes an electronic on/off switch, charge indicator light, counter top charging stand, travel case and a supply of Nivea shaving lotion cartridges. Unbeatable combination!"
3,Maybe my hair wasn't the right type for this iron.,"I think that this iron would work a lot better on thicker hair. My hair is very straight and weightless, and comes down to my shoulders. The bar used to secure the hair around the barrel does not shut tight enough to hold my hair. I can't get the fuller curls I would like, but if my hair was longer I believe I'd have more of a chance. I would not recommend buying this item if you have thin hair, unless you're using it to flip your ends out/under. The straighter would not work on many types of hair, and since it is not completely built to be a straighter, the design easily gets tangled in your hair."
2,BREATHLESS,IT'S FUN AND SEXY...VERY 80'S...THEY DON'T MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS ANYMORE...IT'S THE RICHARD GERE SHOW !!!!
5,Nutra Skin and Joint MSM cream,"I have used this before, it is a great product, but sometimes hard to find locally. Arrived on time, no hassle"
2,I'm clueless,"It's a dart sharpener. Or so it claims to be. But it didn't come with any instructions so I was left to try and figure it out on my own. Do I run the tip along the side, like when you sharpen a knife? Or do I stick it in the depressed area and spin it around like a top?The only thing I figured out was that I couldn't figure out how to use it."
5,good sock,"unfortunately I bought a size too small, but they're still a great pair of socks, super warm, worth every penny"
3,"Great socks, but elastic is weak",I wore these for a 13 mile hike and by the second half of the hike the elastic at the top was very loose and stretched out. Other than that I would recommend these socks.
5,Great socks,These socks are simply the best. They hold up well and wash well. They keep your feet warm and dry in winter and cool and dry in the summer. They are worth every penny.
5,Excellent socks to keep your feet warm,"I have used Smartwool Hiking socks for years and absolutely love these socks. I do a lot of hiking and camping and have used these socks on a regular basis. First, these socks are soft and comfortable which is important when hiking for miles or out in the wilderness camping. Second, my feet tend to be cold and these socks keep them warm and dry which dramatically adds to my comfort factor. I also keep a pair in my Every Day Carry (EDC) bag as part of my gear.If you are a hiker or camper then wool socks are the way to go. Yes, they are more expensive but they are worth the cost. Forget about cotton socks and go to wool.I highly recommend Smart Wool socks."
5,Smartwool is smart indeed,Just putting on these socks makes me feel good. They are the most comfortable socks I have ever worn by far.
5,Great product,"Best sock I have ever bought, well worth $20 a pair. I wore a single pair for a week straight, to work and home and they didnt even smell bad. They do stretch out a bit after wearing them for a day so you can see they are made to accomodate more than one size foot, but its not a big enough annoyance to bring down the rating. They have held up well so far and if they disappoint down the road I will update my review."
5,Excellent hiking socks,"The SmartWool hiking socks are an excellent product. Keep feet dry, and good selection of weights."
3,size chart was not correct,"Smart wool are great socks, unfortunately I trusted the size chart shown and the socks were much smaller than listed. They arrived on time but I ended up giving them as a gift because they were not large enough according to their chart."
2,Nothing special,"A decent sock but not very durable and after merely 5 or 6 washes, it started to lose it's ability to stay up high on the calf. I'd recommend buying something else."
2,Smartwool socks,"During the summer of 2012, I purchased two or three pairs of Smartwool socks for my husband. Thinking I had purchased the best, I sent him off to Elk camp this fall knowing his feet won't get cold. I'm writing this message not because his feet got cold but because one of the socks developed a small hole near the top of the sock. My problem is, I don't know whether to mend the damaged sock, hoping it doesn't happen again, or try to mail it back to you for a replacement. Do you have any suggestions? Any help would be appreciated.Respectfully,P.S.The socks kept his feet warm."
2,Don't get them wet,"If you plan on doing serious backpacking these are not great socks. In really wet environments where wet feet are a fact of life these are utterly useless. Once wet, they stay that way for days literally. Very comfortable, great for dry climates or day hiking. NOT for wet environments at all. I'm sticking with my old GI socks, they dry in under an hour by a fire and a couple hours hanging from my pack and are pretty well just as comfortable."
2,Not good for road cycling,"I was looking for a pair of socks to keep my feet warm for road cycling. These socks are good to wear around the house and walking outside. However, for road cycling, they don't keep your feet warm below 45 degrees temperature. Above 45, they work well."
2,Private Scandals,The book was in much worse condition than disclosed. Pages were stained and stuck together with what appeared to be dried food.
5,A gripping read,"""Private Scandals"" is a well-crafted murder mystery with a good dollop of Nora Roberts brand romance as well. Deanna Reynolds, a news reporter-turned-talk show host, finds herself the target of a stalker's obsession, and must try to uncover her stalker's identity before anyone else around her -- or even she herself -- turns up dead. Along the way she finds love and romance with a fellow newsman, and in so doing unwittingly triggers her stalker into desperate action.Readers will fly through this nearly 500-page read as they race to the finish to either figure out who the stalker is or, as was the case with me, to see if their suspicion was correct. For some reason I was confident very early that I knew who this person was, but knowing didn't keep me from staying up until all hours to verify it.This was an extremely well-written and very entertaining novel."
3,mixed feelings,"This was one of the first Nora Roberts books that I read and I am somewhat disappointed. All though I thought that the book started out all right, I think that it dragged in certain spots and became very predictable. Her books came highly recommended by a close friend so I think that I will give a few more a shot. If I knew more about the glamorous life of tv stars this book may have appealed to me more."
1,Fluff at its flimsiest,"I found this book predictable and hard to get through. Deanna, besides her issues with Angela, has a stalker. When she got her first note from said stalker, I had a pretty good idea who it was. Unfortunately, I was right.Disappointing, formulaic, and boring. Forced myself to finish it in the hopes that Ms. Roberts would throw me a twist. No such luck."
4,Fairly Obvious,"Yes, I found the true bad guy to be fairly obvious, but I still enjoyed the journey.Deanna and Finn are solid characters and it's easy to spend time with them. The insight into what goes into producing a live television show entertained me. I liked the fact that Ms. Roberts briefly touched on the painful issue of date-rape in this novel.Unlike some of her other works, Ms. Roberts didn't spend a great deal of time on settings, other than the television studio type, and that's okay. The whole book works really well and is worth the read.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"
4,Love Nora!,"I'm relatively new to Nora Roberts, so I don't have too many books to compare this to but it's one of my favorites. I adored Deanna and her freshness, her honesty, and her inability to be mean. Angela was a wickedly wonderful character that I loved to hate! This was a nice look into the world of TV Journalism, and it's competitive nastiness."
4,Pager turner for sure...,This book kept me fliping. The first page gets you hooked. The devlopment of the characters is not overly detailed but enough to get you tuned into who they are. The plot is not lacking and is an exciting read. I would recommend this to anyone.
2,not the best,"While not emtirely without merit, and the introuction providing a worthy introduction to the 'Jesus-as-a-myth' meme, most of this book is speculation better suited to the Zeitgeist crowd. It would do one better to read Israel Finklestein."
1,Nonsense,"I thought I understood Jesus and the bible and the story of chriatianity. Then I read the bible. It is obvious to me that this is an act of radical defiance. If you read the book you can easily see that what we are taught and what the truth is a very, VERY different things.One example proves the point. I always believed that when you die you went to heaven to join those loved ones who went before you and to await those who would come later. This is not supported by the bible. Why hasn't anyone made this clear. Probably not a day goes by when preachers console survivors by telling them that their loved one is now ""in a better place."" Why would they say taht when the bible says that is not true. It says nobody goes to heaven until after Jesus comes again. Nobody. So heaven is empty right now. wow."
1,wrong!!!!!!!,jesus is not a myth. just read the bible and u will find out that jesus is not a myth. the bible is a true book. i think this is nonsence. jesus suffered greatly. he felt real pain and humans feel pain. jesus is the savior of the world and my world. he died so we can live. this author is a bunch of crap he dosent know what hes talkin about.
3,"Great Frying Pan, Poor Description","I received the frying pan with two scratches in the non-stick coating. I wasn't going to go through all the crapola of sending it back, since they were fairly small and not on the flat bottom. OK, so what's the problem...If you advertise it as new and in reality it's a factory second, then take the stuff back to Mainland China and sell it where you got it."
2,Watch out for the fins!,"This hair dryer is very quiet, but understand that quiet equates into less a powerful blower. The 1875 watts only means that it can still get the air HOT, and this dryer will still do that. It was working fine until I was using it this past weekend and my hair got sucked in through one of the side air vents. The dryer sucked my hair in and then stopped the fans from running completely. I will not use this dryer again. My advice, if you have long hair, stay away from this one!--Joey"
2,Motor burn out,"I haven't had the ""hair-sucked-in"" problem, but the motor on my dryer did burn out after just a few months of use. I have to say that I did enjoy the quiet operation for the period of time that it was functional, but I have never had a hair dryer that died so quickly. I would shop for a better model before buying this one."
1,Don't Buy It !!!,"I just purchased this hair dryer just before Christmas (Yes, I purchased it from ... and threw away the receipt and now am stuck with it. Should have just bought it on Amazon. I will the next one!) Well after a few days of using it and turning it on to high for about a minute or so, it started to smoke and spark and get very red and smell like it was going to catch on fire. It seems that the motor gets too hot and it can't handle the temperature. (I did learn that the 1875 is a number for heat, not power ) Even if you have it on medium, it still does it. It doesn't have much power either. Just thought I would warn you ! I tried to get in touch with the company and have had no luck with that either. Always keep your receipts !"
1,Watch Out!!!,"I've had this dryer for about 7 months and noticed that it has air intakes on the side of the dryer, thus allowing the quietness. These intakes sucked my hair in and I HAD TO CUT IT OFF to get it loose. It started to burn my hair. Be careful if you have one and don't buy it if you don't!"
2,It ate my hair too!,I had the same problem with the side vents on this hairdryer. As my hair started getting longer the problem increased. Then today it ate a huge chunk of my hair which then caught on fire and stopped the fans. I would avoid this hairdryer!
1,Great product - but it overheats often (dangerously hot),"Great product, quiet, and it dries - but it overheats often (dangerously hot). After doing some research it looked like I wasn't alone either...."
5,I love this dryer!,"I haven't had any problems with it sucking in or burning my hair, at all. I've had other dryers that do that. I love this hair dryer! It has a wider head than most to dry your hair really fast, and really smooth. And it is really quiet.I would really recommend it. The only downside is that it doesn't come with a diffuser."
4,Nice Swamp monster,"for a Sci Fi type of movie, it was actually pretty good! usually when i think of Sci Fi type movies, i automatically skip it, but i decided to give this one a shot and i actually liked it.Even though there were some small plot holes as to why the monster couldn't cross county linesor how it became to be an actual monster?but i dont sit there and talk negitively about every horror movie and how it sucked b.c it didnt do this or that, blah blah blah.dont want to hear the BS.it was a good movie for a low budget film.i enjoyed it a lot and i might just add it to my horror collection. :)good job you guys"
3,Not too bad...,"This movie wasn't too bad. The chacaters were very likable. The Swamp Devil wasn't that scarey, but maybe it would have been if I lived in the woods or near a swamp! If you're looking for a good, creepy movie that the whole family can watch, this is a good choice. There's no sex and only one scene was the least bit gorey. I don't recall any bad language. I think I'll probably dust it off one day and watch it again."
3,Not bad as it goes,"Felt bad seeing Bruce Dern slide downhill into this type of movie. On the whole, it wasn't bad considering some of the other grade ""D"" out there."
1,Horrible!,This film was horrible. The monster looked so fake and unbelievable. The BEST part of the film is the lead actress. The plot stinks and the movie is a total waste of time! Avoid this at all costs!
2,As an avid Bruce Dern fan,"I had to get this. However, the dialogue and the other actors are so bad as to make this a highly entertaining film, up there with the likes of Shark Attack 3. Buy, laugh, and enjoy this train wreck of a movie.* DVD Note: The audio on this DVD was a little messed up at parts, creating occasional minor electronic feedback. I thought at first it was my DVD player or TV, but I tried another player on another TV, and the problem persisted. Don't know if a whole bad batch of these went out, or if it was just mine. The disc itself looks fine and undamaged."
1,No,I was very disappointed in this book. I started it a couple of times and was never able to finish it
4,Riveting!,"This is book will captivate you. It has just the right amount of technical detail (albeit sometimes incorrect -- see below), mixed with suspense, and action that makes for a good read. The author has really learned how to string words together to create dialog. My one criticism is the use of the word antennae. And given his background, the author should know enough not to use it as a descriptive term for an external attachment to a radio frequency sending and/or receiving device. Antennae are those things that stick out of the heads of bugs! Antennas are what you connect to a radio, radar, or other device that emits radio frequency signals. My advice to the author is to come down with both feet on the publisher's reviewers, who are probably the ones at fault. Still, a great book for a relatively new author and I would rate it 4.5.Ed C"
1,"One star for the music, but...","...five for pure atmosphere. This is not the band that would later record ""Germs(GI)""; this is four kids screwing around, having fun. There are hints of talent in songs like 'Forming' and 'Let's Pretend', but most of the set is a mess. Still, the importance of the moment that ""Germicide"" documents--the infancy of America's most influential punk scene--cannot be diminished. For a frightening contrast(and I'm not using ""frightening"" in a hyperbolic way), listen to this CD and then watch the documentary ""The Decline of Western Civilization"" in which the late-period Germs appear. It will give you an idea of the dark depths plumbed on the L.A. punk scene in the space of two and a half years."
4,"Germs - 'Germicide: Live At The Whiskey, 1977' (Bomp)","This is only the second Germs release I've ever heard. How many 'actual' albums did they put out? Was very impressed with the sincerity of the Germs. They're a true-to-the-roots all out American punk band. They're dirty, rude, mean, offensive and have a totally violent additude. Perfect! Tracks I found myself looking forward to on this CD were ""Sex Boy"", ""Sweet Dream"", the slamming ""Suicide Machine"" and ""Teenage Clone"". Line-up: Darby Crash (R.I.P.)-vocals, Pat Smear-guitar, Lorna Doom-bass and Belinda Carlisle (Go-Go's) believe or not on drums. Should draw in old school followers of Dead Kennedys, Social Distortion, Black Flag and Circle Jerks to name just a few. A should have."
3,***,"If you're complaining about the poor sound quality and poor musicianship on this 27 year old recording of the Germs' first ever live show then you're really, really missing the point.Would you complain about the smell at a meat market?"
1,Listener Beware!,"You've gotta be kidding me! From a historical standpoint, this recording is interesting because it captures The Germs in their infancy. From a musical standpoint, however, it blows. If you are curious about The Germs, avoid this CD like the plague and instead seek out the GI LP or MIA CD. Only then will you be rewarded with some of the finest punk rock ever recorded. The Germs actually learned how play their instruments and the addition of Don Boles on drums was, in my opinion, what really made them great."
1,has anyone HEARD this cd????,"you know, i enjoy punk as much as the next guy, and its neat to hear early recordings of ""legendary artists"", but a) the germs are only legendary because darby crash killed himself, and b) musically, sound quality, lyrically, whatever you want, this is not good. worth hearing for darby's baiting the crowd (although his vocabulary consists of about 4 words at this point), and the song victim, most notably for its ending, acheived when darby finishes yelling the lyrics (out of sync with the music of course) and implores the band ""stop.....STOP!!!!"" then immediately asks ""whats next?"" this is funny enough, but not worth the money."
3,Great music,I had a specific song in mind when I ordered this. I was disapointed when it was not included on the Cd.
3,Its an alright CD.,"I needed another gospel CD so I decided to purchase this one even though the movie has been out for some time now. Its an alright CD. I absolutely love the Tamala Mann song ""Father can you hear me"". It make me cry everytime I hear it! But thats about the only song I play over and over."
5,Touching,"The cd is beautiful,it has alot of beautiful spiritual songs that would just get down in your soul."
4,Diary of a Mad Black Woman,"This music CD is great, but can't be compared to the music that is in the movie."
4,Purify Me!!!!!!!!!!,"I will admit, I only purchased this CD for the one particular song, Purify Me!! It had been playing on the radio for sometime, but since Michael Baisden hit the radio airwaves, he plays it practically every day. Well now so do I. I love this song. The words, the melody, everything about it makes, you want to jump in your car, open the sunroof, and start cruising down the highway with your man. Love it!!. This young lady does not get nearly the credit she deserves!!! Amazing Talent!!"
4,4 1/2 stars - a current soundtrack that's actually good,"Various Artists - Diary of a Mad Black Woman (Motown, 2005)In this day and age of file-sharing and making your own CD compilations, I thought that soundtracks weren't in style anymore. In fact, I only picked this up for India.Arie's song, ""Purify Me"", but I ended up enjoying all of the songs, especially the two gospel ones at the end. Before I go further, I am shocked that for someone to be the editorial reviewer, his review is a little inaccurate. First of all, India.Arie didn't sing ""Different Directions"", Angie Stone did. And Jewel didn't originally sing ""One of Us"", Joan Osborne did. Speaking of that song, that rendition done here by Cheryl Pepsii Riley is the only song that I really didn't care for (Prince did a better remake of it) but even that song is growing on me. It is also great to see Heather Headley back on the scene with ""Ain't It Funny"". When's that new album coming out, Heather? -EJR"
4,GREAT SOUNDTRACK; MISSING SONGS,"While this soundtrack captures and conveys the effervescence and liveliness of a teriffic film that veers between the reverent and the decidedly IRreverent, the best two pieces of music were inexplicably omitted from this album - - but can be obtained elsewhere, for those, like myself, who find the album truly incomplete or lacking without them - - Toni Braxton's 'Stupid', and 'Dazz', by Brick."
1,Don't believe the hype!!!,"This soundtrack is like the movie. Overhyped, very long and just okay. Tyler Perry has had his 15 minutes of fame with that tired, predictable and not very funny character Ma Dear. This CD is very disappointing. So was the movie."
3,"Interesting browse, but too esoteric for most people","The book is almost unreadable, because the author makes too many leaps (traveling back and forth in time and place) that require too much effort to follow. This is a book which displays deep knowledge of American music , with some discussion of the Basement Tapes themselves, but not enough. I found the brief description of individual songs in the back more useful that the the main part of the book. The author's leaps and observations are too esoteric - most fans will not find it worth the effort. Also, it goes without saying that you need to hear the actual tapes (which are available in an unofficial 5 CD bootleg set) . -WGL"
3,You should already know about Bob Dylan.,"I bought and read Invisible Republic with absolutely no knowledge of Bob Dylan. I love the sarcastic yet reflective tone Marcus uses in the book; however, he expects the reader to know all about the songs on the Basement Tapes beforehand. Marcus makes references to many of Dylan's songs in order to clarify some of his points, but these references mean little to someone who has never heard of these songs. Anyone who already knows about Bob Dylan (and/or the Anthology of American Folk Music) would probably enjoy Invisible Republic. A clueless person like me should not bother to read it."
1,This is no Mystery Train,"Marcus has written a BOOK, and entire BOOK for heavens sake, on a collection of songs. He goes on for pages and pages, dissecting songs that Dylan probably wrote in minutes. Searching for the meaning of life in a song like 'Lo and Behold' is fruitless, I can assure you.Read Mystery Train again if you need a dose of Marcus."
3,"Unhand Bob Dylan from your endless historicism, sir,","Unhand Bob Dylan from your endless historicism, sir scholarship, the muse of Bob Dylan does not need to be reduced to the moral and fables of US history. Think rather of empire, of ""empire burlesque,"" and the poetic syntax of a mind resisting US imperialism and the stranglehold of capitalism upon the soul. Think poetry, and the Jeremiah in the wilderness; not the son of Woody Guthrie, was this Bob, but the offspring of David and the sacred heart, ""walking between the two deserts, singing."" Your endless reach to historicism drowns out the lyrics and would do better on the Berkeley campus where you do in Dwinelle Hall belong. (But your love for the man, yes, is very very real, and the writing keeps on saying the same things. Please write on Van Morrison and ""the invisible republic"" of Irish lyricism across the Atlantic and the Pacific and the moon.) ""Mutual forgiveness is the path to Eternity"" (William Blake, or was it Bob Dylan?)"
1,Marcus is a boob.,"Mr. Marcus is a sort of post-modern groupie. He tries here to get into Dylan's smelly pants, but really, who cares. His theories seldom ""match up"" with anything palpable. Why do people read this crud. I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough."
1,Silly !,"I know this book revolves around an abstract idea linking Bob Dylan`s basement tapes to an old , lost America ( the invisible Republic ) , but , oh dear , where do I begin ?"" Invisible Republic "" is one of the worst books I`ve ever read , I just hope people don`t take Greil Marcus`s ludicrous theory on the basement tapes to be gospel ( no pun intended ) . This is a classic case of an author`s ego winning out to common sense .It`s hard enough to read a book , if you`ve lost all faith in the author`s integrity , thanks to the laughably tenuous links that he uses to back up his theory , but when you have to wade through reams of portentious , almost unreadable prose , to reach the same conclusion , it`s almost torture . This book is full of pretensious , self-indulgent nonsense that only very gullible people could believe , but I suppose any Bob Dylan book sells , and Greil Marcus is fully aware of this ."
3,pilgrim's progress audio,"this series of discs is exactly as advertised. even though actors make the older english at least understandable, there is still a problem with following along for most listeners. despite heroic efforts of those involved, i prefer the written version. if you want audio, you've got it here."
5,That Yellow Bastard,"This a the figure from the movie ""Sin City"",the episode called,""That Yellow Bastard"". The figure is very durable and looks just like the character in the movie. The figure comes with a wip,knife,and the syringe that he used in the movie,all can be easily placed in his hands. The figure stands well on his own and doesn't fall down,a lot of work went into the sculpturing of this figure,as you'll be able to see. If you're a fan of the movie,this figure is a must! I have it on a shelf,right next to my Hartigan and Marv figures."
4,"Papa, My Father","This book is broken down into the different ways a father can influence their child. After we finished reading this book we gave a copy to each of our sons. We thought the author did such a good job of telling how his father had influenced him in ways that probably his father hadn't even realized. Its not just the ""big lessons"" that fathers plan on teaching their child, but sometimes the lessons they learn that weren't consciously taught. Would recommend this book to any young father to read."
1,Short life. No factory support.,"I purchased over 30 of these cameras from AmazonThe good:1)Great definition2)Very wide angle.3)Solid state PTZ functionThe bad:1)Right after 2 years of operation, the image sensor goes bad and they start producing psychedelic colors, until they quit working. This happens even though they are indoors.2)Axis will not repair them, and will not sell you the image sensor. They just tell you to get new cameras.3)About half of the cameras have died."
3,Good Camera but that night vision,"The Axis 212 is a good product, the picture quality is very good and it has great features. But the lack of night vision was a problem for me. It was easy to install on my network and simple to locate. I like that is has no moving parts. All in all a good product.SupernovaAxis 212 Ptz Network Camera Pan Tilt Zoom with No Moving Parts"
5,World's Best Irish Guitarist no doubt,"I've seen John Doyle in concert several times and he is absolutely awesome. This DVD is great if you have even a rudimentary ability to play guitar. You'll learn the D tuning that all the Irish guitarists (and lots of American rock n' rollers) use, and a ton of ways to make your chords sound fuller and more interesting if you're into rhythm guitar. If you get a chance to see John Doyle with Liz Carroll, I highly recommend you take advantage of it!"
3,Power tuning,"Useful information but the quality of the book needs to be improved, some of the tables and charts are faded, as though the years have not been kind and there has been many."
4,Good All-Around book for tuning your MGB,"How to Power-Tune MGB 4-cylinder engines is a good all-around book, although some of the language can be confusing. A good point about this book is that it does not only focus on the engine, but on exhaust, intake, tires, carburation, etc. It tells you exact brands that are good, and that is also nice. However, as this book is produced in England, many parts from companies are not available. I highly reccommend this book to anyone owning an MGB."
3,Lots of information but heavy-handed advice,"While the book provides a lot of in-depth information regarding the breed, with lots of wonderful pictures, Dr. Allen often presents the breed in a negative light. My impression is that she wants to warn off the casual buyer, and for this I can forgive her. Owning a Neo is not for the faint-of-heart. My advice: Get the book and be aware of the issues she raises. Then - be pleasantly surprised when your Neo turns out not to be the aggressive monster she describes."
2,pretty pictures- misguided philosophy,great photos of dogs from around the world. the writer does a great disservice to the reader and the breed by extolling hypothyroidism.
1,waste of money,"My dachshund took a chunk off of the Huck ball within the first 10 minutes of owning it. It went straight to the trash. I have yet to find a toy she cannot destroy. Yes they offer a guarantee and a free replacement, but why replace it if she will destroy it again. What about Money Back Guarantee???"
4,"great, but not indestructible","My 1 year-old German Shepherd is OBSESSED with his huck ball and wants to play with it 24/7. It is like a teething ring for him and he LOVES to play ball. It is a great ball, and a good size even for a big dog, 95 lbs. ( I have a larger huck but he prefers the small size). He has destroyed one and is on his second but it takes him months to tear it apart and that is using it on a daily basis. Great ball for heavy chewers!BTW, he is now 5 yrs old and still obsessed with small Huck balls. Yes, he has gone through quite a few in 5 yrs. but they are the only ball he can't instantly destroy. I am about to order two more (I like to have one in reserve). Takes him about 6 months to ""do one in"". One added plus.... they help keep his teeth clean as he is always gnawing on it! He has beautiful teeth!"
4,"Modern, Mellow and Folksy","These are folksy type songs but they don't sound old or recycled. They have a fresh, modern sound to them without crossing the border into rock or pop or even country. Each of the songs on this album could conceivably fall into one of those other categories but they are more properly in their own. They are also quite enjoyable.Maura has a lovely voice. It sometimes seems as if it has been electronically enhanced to compete with the very strong instrumentation but never sounds strained or overwhelmed. It is a nice mix."
5,One of my all-time favorites. Every song is a hit.,"This is one of my all-time favorite CDs. Whenever I give it to friends as a present, they love it. The lyrics are meaningful poems which capture love and life experiences. The music is wonderful. Every song on the CD is a hit with me. I highly recommend it!"
1,IT'S EVERBODY ELSE'S WORK,"I read this book with great interest. As long-time professional in the career services business, this book is simply a compilation of methods used by other career service firms. I don't see anything here that is original. Shame on the author."
2,Somewhat Booming for Baby Boomers,"I am among many followers of John Michael Talbot. We reflected and prayed with all of his past """"cassettes."" We are part of a Small Christian Community for many years. We have attended his concerts in our area. We regret that this particular recording is too jazzie for the Post Vatican II Boomers who ran off with the Church in the modern world. We would be interested if another age group related to this recording as much as we did in the 70's and 8o's. Then it surely is worth it! Thanks for the opportunity to share honestly as an elder Baptized Boomer! Jane 1946"
5,Very Satisfied,"I bought the Vidal Sassoon Dryer as a gift for my wife. I was a little worried at first, you know buying her a hair dryer as a gift. I lucked out, she loves it. She used to do hair at a salon, and she said it reminded her of the professional dryers she used to use.Thank You"
5,Classic,"It was February 1973 and I was in Benidorm, Spain. Saw this album in a record shop and picked it up. The Strand blew me away! These guys had a very unique sound and the entire album brings back lots of memories. To me this is their best work and all their other albums pale in comparison.Do the Strandsky!Highly recommended."
5,The best of Roxy's superior quintet,"For Your Pleasure marks the pinnacle of Roxy's magnificent early/mid period (from the eponymous debut through to Siren). It transcends mere pop music - the cinematic imagery it invokes is more akin to a Wagnerian opera than what you'd expect from a ""glam"" rock band from Newcastle.Stranded is almost as good but FYP gets the gold medal on the back of ""Dreamhome Heartache"", which the reviewers below have aptly described as inspired madness, and Beauty Queen, one of BF's most exquisite and evocative ballads.I could go on and on...already have...but I heap the highest praise on this album and have the utmost regard for all those who appreciate its brilliance."
3,"fun, plastic, decadence and swanky disco hijinks!","In Every Dream Home, A Heartache, is in itself a great reason to own this. I'm old enough to have a beautiful vinyl edition, and this is about vinyl. Look for the joke in _Every Dream Home_. It's a hoot kids."
2,"A Roxy fan, but not of this music","I do like Roxy Music at their best or even at something that resembles their best, but I have to say that this CD does nothing for me. I gave it a fair chance and I usually hold on to CDs that I believe will grow on me, but even if the FBI repeatedly played this for me if I was in Waco, I can't say that it would grow on me."
1,Hmm,"I just listened to ""The Bogus Man"" twice. What a piece of garbage -- and nearly 10 minutes long. If this is any indication of the rest of the album, then stay away."
3,It's decent,"This is a pretty neat thing because although it is a sleeping bag liner it still has a tougher outer lining so it can be used alone (for warm weather of course). My only complaint is that I am 6'1"" and it is somewhat too small. (it covers up my shoulders but leaves little ""bundling up"" room)"
2,No subtance.,"I ordered this, and it is just basically just a mini sewing dictionary. It gives terms and defines them.. and recommends what you should have in a sewing box... no real details on how to sew. The only nice part is the project cards that it comes with. If you are wanting to LEARN to sew and learn different techniques... this isn't what you should get. Disapointing."
3,Okay book; for beginners,"This book is ok for learning to sew. there are so many free tutorials online, that you can use to learn how to make things. You don't HAVE to spend money on a book. BUT, this was a nice resource for sewing terms, great picture cards and sewing tutorials. But i haven't used any of it, besides the sewing terms."
3,Easy... but it shows,"There are a lot of good projects, but a few more steps would make the final results look better. Here is a link to a tote I made from the book [...]"
5,Beastie Boys old school stuff - it rocks,the whole cd is full of ny punk scene music...b-boys and bad brains...can't go wrong there.
4,The most amazing cd of the Hardcore genre to date!,"This cd is the best out of my whole collection of over 3000 records and cd. You should but this out on vinyl to. The Nihilistics are great! Kraut and Even Worse are good too! where can i get more Nihilistics, Kraut and Even Worse?"
4,The Book helped me change for the better,"In 1975 I was given a copy of the book, The Cross and the Switchblade while i was waiting for a Greyhound Bus to go see my dad's mom whom I had never met. I was 14 years old and found myself put on the street by my natural mother who told me never come home. If it had not been for the spark this book put in my life and the seed that this book planted helped me prepare for my early adult life taking care of myself. I could not depend or trust anyone who said they loved me because I just didn't trust them, my own mother who said she loved me cast me to wolves, what would others do to me. It was David Wilkerson's book that changed me not immediately but planted the seed for the harvest in my life. I am now a Minister of the Gospel with a good business and a family whom I love and kids I wouldn't trade for anything."
2,wild and tough,"I read the book before I watched the movie. And as it happens so often, I think the book is much better, because it expresses so much deeper what goes on inside the characters. Also the works of the Holy Spirit is, except for one incident, lost in the movie.Still for a person who does not know the book, it is better to see the movie, then not know about the heart change from Christ at all.I wish the movie could be reproduced with modern techniques. It can not be hidden,that it is very old (1960s). And hopefully with the reproduction the soul work documented in the book could be much better expressed. Incorporating parts of Nicky Cruz's book ""Run baby run"" would make it almost perfect."
5,What a God we have,I saw this movie yearssssssssss ago back in the 70's and then read the book and was touched deeply now that I have a putter and can order it I am and want all my family to watch God Bless all
2,the cross and the switchblade,I first heard of Nicky Cruz when i was 12 years old and spotted a short colorful story of his life.I think the film was ok but most of the events in the film never really happended the film is not great i think reading the book run baby run is the most entirtaining book i have read it is very sad and violent. Iam now 14 years old and trying to get hold of the film run baby run
2,Christian?,"I realize that this a true story, but they could have tried to keep it as Christian as possible. I watched this with my family and was greatly dissapointed. This has some bad language, bad music, and lacks modesty in areas. Glad Nicky and others turned to christ."
5,Powerful!,"This film is so powerful - prepare to be deeply moved! Real life account of David Wilkerson, preacher to the gangs who meets up with Nicky Cruz - warlord of one of the worst gangs who terrorized the streets of New York.You can tell it was filmed on a low budget, but this doesn't detract from the film.Emotions of characters range from fear, guilt, anger, bitterness, hate, rage to forgiveness & a love that overcomes it all.Special features include a look at David Wilkerson's work today on the streets, featuring some of the projects that have been set up.A film that will inspire & challenge!Billy Graham Presents: The ClimbOne Starry Night: Stop and Smell the Roses Series (Stop and Smell the Roses)"
5,"""take a trip with grooves & moves via Sheila E""","Concord Vista comes up with another winner, this time through the talent of Sheila E & The E-Train - ""Writes Of Passage"", featuring funkified, contemporary jazz excursion from the most prodigiously talented drummer/percussionist/vocalist on the planet.With Sheila E's relentlessly funky grooves propelling her band like a musical locomotive, The E-Train - featuring Peter Michael Escovedo (drums/percussion), Renato Neto (keyboards), Eric Leeds (sax/flute), Marc Van Wageningen (bass), and special guest Ray Obiedo (guitar)...each track moves forward from the first note, with full steam ahead.

1,Genes VII - What's new,"I was keen to see this new edition with its supposed emphasis on the characterization of eukaryotic genes. However, I am extremely disappointed with the changes. In fact, on comparing with the previous editions I have, the eukaryotic sections are little more than a rehash. The sections on genome analysis are also little more than a re-write of earlier editions: chapter 3 includes several pages on Cot Analysis - does anyone still do this? One other major concern is the lack of new material/new research -almost all the 'further reading' sections refer to papers pre-1990! Genes was once the best advanced genetics text on the market - I sadly feel that Genes VII no longer holds that position."
2,"Thinner, more expensive but still maintain its so-so quality","I have a chance to read this new edition of the Genes. It is obviously thinner than the previous edition. The materials presented are roughly the same with some new figures (most of them crystal structure). The drawing figures shown throughout the text are still pretty poor and ugly. They are somehow difficult to understand. The references given are not very up-to-date and most of them come from ""Cell"" where the author himself is the editor. Well, generally this edition is little bit better than the previous edition in term of modern idea of the field but not that obvious. Try the new edition of Lodish et al., you will see the difference."
2,Genes,"The organization of this book is horrible and the explanations are not student friendly. You could buy this book if you wanted to fill your bookshelves for aethetics reasons only, but if you want to learn about genes, get another book which is student friendly."
5,POP & ME - A Must See,"I really am not a big fan of documentaries but this a film that everyone should see, especially men. It is a great way to see the world as well really take a look at the relationship you have with your own son or father. My wife loved it as well! You definitely will take a different look at life after this."
1,Disappointed,"We did not find it interesting. It could have been if it had spent more time exploring the cultures that they visited. The only good part was the end, but it certainly wasn't worth sitting through to get there."
5,i love remo,"im starting to like remo heads more the the evens heads, these one dont seem to loose there tone from the beating"
5,"Wary of religious ""Truth""","""God without Religion"" is excellently written. It is for the searcher. It tells us that no religion has the absolute truth,and it advises to question religions that claim to have it.The author also tells us that we can find God everywhere by looking at his creation. We canfeel God within us by recognizing, loving and enjoying the beauty of nature, but most of all by respecting it and trying tolive in harmony with it.He also offers bold social criticism along with practical waysabout how to get in touch with our inner self and calm our innerunrest. Sankara Saranam's book offers true spiritual guidance for all those of us whose spiritual needs have been left unfulfilled by organized religion."
2,Title is misleading,"I think the title is a misleading. It says God Without Religion. Based on the title I assumed it would talk about a god and how man made religions are flawed. The book did indeed cover the flaws of religion although perhaps too briefly. I'm sure a giant book could be written on the subject but this book just touches on it lightly. I also assumed the book would cover the topic of some kind of supreme being which would be proved by a mathematical or scientific method. After all the term ""God Without"" implies there is a god. Instead what it goes on to say is there is no God and everyone should worship themselves to fill the void of being godless. The Title should really say something like ""There is No God and Religion is Stupid"". Perhaps I just wasn't ready to stand on my head or do breathing exercises but I found the second half of the book unexpected and a little boring."
5,READ IT NOW!!!!!,"Read this book Now!! As a life long student in pursuit of the infinite, I have only these words: Read this book!! Get this information into to your brain and circulating through every cell of your body, manifest. Study the book. Don't let it out of your of hands! If you need to share it with someone else, buy them their own copy, as I have done for my friends, who are university instructors in philosophy & religion. If the information in this work is the only information you receive in a lifetime, it will be the only information you will ever need!!"
2,Concerns about this book,"This book was interesting and enlightening in pointing out problems with our society today, where we divide ourselves based on our religions and other differences rather than realizing that we are all essentially the same. However, it always concerns we when someone says that they have the only answer and that everyone must follow only one path to God or enlightenment. The author's position that pranayama meditation is the only way to find God is just as concerning to me as Christianity's claim that belief in Jesus is the only way to God."
4,Interesting Diversion,"For Sherlockians, this is an interesting departure of Holmes' continuing adventures as related by his protege, Edward Porter Jones ( referred to as Porter). Biggle can be a wonderful writer, equally talented in Science Fiction and in Mysteries, and while this is not one of his best, it is quite readable and an interesting diversion occasionally a tad precious, and there are some conflicts with the Canon, but all-in-all, it is a fun read . Do I rank it up with other Holmes homages or pastiches - no, but if you are interested in collecting Holmes related material, this should have a place on your shelf. Also recommend The Glendower Conspiracy, which is the second of the series."
2,Not a fan,"Maybe I got a bad one, but it did not do very well in my setup. I tried it on my pedal board and isolated, as well as with the provided power supply, 1spot and battery.To start, I'm not a fan of the fact that it's huge. A clean boost has a relatively small circuit, and should not take up as much space as my TC Electronic Noa Delay.It also added tons of nasty noise. Not what I would call clean gain at all. The vol pot sizzled and crackled when it was turned, and the bypass switch produced a VERY loud/nasty popping noise, quite bad compared to all other pedals I own.It does seem to feel like it's great quality, unfortunately once plugged in it just didn't work out for me. Again, maybe mine was defective, but my opinion if it has been tainted, and wouldn't own another one.This got returned."
3,"Nah, get the MXR Micro Amp!","I've tried them all for under 100 clams and the BBE Boosta Grande is just not the one. First of all, it adds bass and muddles your high-end clarity. Not good. And it just sounded artificial to me. A very ""transistor-y"" character. It also doesn't pack as much gain as the Micro Amp. The MXR however, doesn't color your tone, it maintains your clarity and harmonics and adds a touch of compression so you just get more ""punch""... more ""crank"". Just listen to Gilby Clarke. A Micro Amp set at about 2 o'clock in front of a VOX AC-30 or AC-15 and yahooooey!!! The Boosta Grande might work okay with acoustics or for clean PA purposes, I suppose. I wouldn't know, I'm more of a ""vintage warmth"" tube amp kind of player."
4,"Thew work well, but they're a bit long for my tastes.","I am a pretty regular darts player and I have a set of Piranhas that I play with most of the time. I keep an extra set for friends to play with and a lot of extra shafts and other accessories. These would be great if you like long shafts, but they make my darts too long and I don't like where the center of gravity is. They do hold the flights securely and are of good quality."
5,Great for my ikea changing table,"This fits great my gulliver changing table. It is not extra firm, I think it's confortable for my baby.I cover it with a Carters Super Soft Printed Changing Pad Cover and looks great in my girl's room."
4,Useful on a dresser,We bought this to go on a Stork Craft dresser for our toddler's room. It fits nicely and I'm thankful that it came with straps and screws to attach to the back of the dresser; otherwise it slides around when I'm putting my daughter on or taking her off of it.
5,Changing Table Pad,My husband build a changing table and then we realized that they mostly were 32 inches long. I found the 30 incher on here from LA Baby. When I ordered it...the order was sent out and I received it within 3 days. Very happy with the product and the time it took to send and receive it. It all worked out perfect. I give LA Baby an AAA+ and Amazon AAA+ also. Thanks!
5,Fits Stork Craft Beatrice table with hutch,"We needed a changing pad that was shorter than the typical 32"", in order to fit a table with a hutch. This product is holding up well after a month of use and the surface hasn't picked up any stains yet from messes that soaked the covers."
5,Absolutely great!!,"I couldn't believe the price of this item when I ordered it. I read some of the other reviews and thought the worst thing could be to not have all the parts or screws. It came with all the parts and fit my 2000 Honda, Civic absolutely great! The guy who worked on my car couldn't believe I purchased this for such a good price since it is usually found for a couple of hundred dollars.Thanks for helping my pocket!"
4,Good product,"This is a good product and functional. I've just installed it. So far so good, I've not seen any problem with it. Only, it sent in taking more than two weeks and missing one gasket which I have to call back to the sender. The response was fast with three days I got the gasket (between the manifold and converter). You need to check of what they have sent."
2,P0420 error code 7 months later.,"Received the product in good condition with everything needed for install on my Honda Civic. Had it installed professionally at the Honda dealer. They said it installed with no problems, but warned me that often aftermarket catalytic converters will throw error codes due to not having enough platinum in them. Sure enough, about 7 months after the install I got a P0420 ""catalytic converter efficiency below threshold"" error code. Called Dorman, and they said they will honor the warranty through the seller. Basically I would need to return this part to amazon.com, and they will send me a new one. Given the high-ish labor costs, and since I have no confidence a new one will be better, most likely I will keep this one. Not happy with the quality."
1,Piece of Garbage!,"I bought the part from this seller1: Dorman OE Solutions Exhaust Manifold 674-439 Sold by: Amazon.com, LLC, had Midas put in. May 3rd it was installed. November 10 just 6 months later, my engine light on my 98 Honda Civic CX comes on. I have to pay $48 to have mechanic diagnose problem to find I need a NEW exhaust manifold. Now I'm out $167 plus the fee by Midas to have mechanic install. DON'T buy this part. I've left two messages with no response. Amazon said it is seller's responsibility. Dorman says it's seller's responsibility. But seller being Amazon.com LLC results in no replies. PLUS DORMAN is NOT guaranteeing their product like their warranty states it will. Now I have to pay a shop just to get the warranty through them. I asked Dorman if perhaps it's because it didn't have enough Platinum in it, and they replied it has no platinum, which my understanding this part should have. This is a complete rip off and has been a giant headache!!!"
3,Part Number: 674-439,"i haven't had a chance yet to install, but i am very skeptical. the bolts and nuts where just rolling around freely inside the box, hopefully all of them are there. i compared the actual parts versus the picture on this website and nothing matches up. the gasket had a dent on it also.... i will update you on how everything goes...."
1,Wrong Product,I just learned that this product is not the correct part for my car. It is beyond the 30 day return so I am unable to return this product without losing part of my money. Very disappointed.
2,200 miles and done.,Bought this to replace cracked manifold. Went on easy everything fit ok. Cleared cat ineficiency code. Good for 200 miles and cat ineficiency code is back. Thank you dorman for selling me crap.
1,Piece of Crap,"I installed this in May of 2010 when I bought it to replace a cracked manifold as many of you so often do and are now in search of this part. After a couple of weeks the CEL came on. I bought a scanner and the Catalyst inefficiency light came on. I replaced both sensors, but to no avail! The Catalyst on these are not reliable I seriously cannot recommend this. After all this time of my CEL reminding me of what a piece of crap this is I finally decided to come on here and warn you all NOT to buy this product. Unfortunately I have not tried to resolve the issue with the manufacturer. I will have to find a suitable replacement at some point. Like I really want to do that!"
3,"It wasn't bad, but for some reason, it didn't catch me","I got this book, and expected it to be a fun read, and for awhile it was. It's got some great ancedotes on how the various rules in the baseball rule book have come up.However, as the book wore on, it got more tedious. Some of them are very funny, and I enjoyed the book in places, but I felt it too tedious of a read for my personal enjoyment.That's why I gave it three stars instead of a lesser rating. I expect others will enjoy it, but for me *PERSONALLY*, I felt it was tedious."
5,Smoochable Lips,I luv cufflings & these luscious red lips really makes my dress shirts even more feminine; i get a lot of compliments.
2,Not as useful as I thought it would be,"I thought it would be a bit larger. It's rather tiny and doesn't hold much. It hold exactly 10 diapers and just barely. Would had been much better had it been made to store the diapers upwards cuz I can fit just over a dozen that way, but the handle does not go high enough to carry it w/ the diapers that way. There's also no room to store a normal sized package of wipes!! Hello?! Diapers are just as important as wipes! I cannot store my package of wipes and all that would really fit in any of these holders is a travel pack. I am not about to start buying travel packs in addition to what I already buy. I never need ointments and such so I am really thinking of sending this back. Nowhere near as useful and unique as I thought it would be. The more I think about it the more disappointed I am actually."
1,Returning it,"I was looking for a caddy to keep in our master bedroom while our newborn is in with us so we didn't have to go change diapers in his room. Since I generally like Skip Hop products I thought this would be a good item. As soon as I opened it though I hated it. The caddy is made of hard plastic and is incredibly loud and heavy even when empty. The smallest movement makes everything rattle. The side pockets just slide on and move easily so it makes the whole thing just feel incredibly cheap and flimsy. The same for the drawers - just plastic sliding in plastic so it feels cheap. Despite how cheap it all feels, the cost (almost $40 at the time) is rediculous. I am returning and am getting a canvas one from JJ Cole."
2,Cute but too small to be useful,"I bought this as a first time, completely inexperienced mom. I thought I would need a diaper caddy to carry around if I were changing my son anywhere else in the house. Plus it was so cute. I know, completely silly. I have thought several times as using it for like a gift wrap of sorts for another baby shower but haven't yet. It's cute but it's so small and so, very impractical. The little bins and drawers don't hold much more than a few little things and maybe a dozen diapers. I would not recommend spending your money."
2,Not the best Tesla book,"This book starts off real fine about Tesla and his life work, but then deteriorates into a men in black story about fantastic schemes that our government is hatching. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is serious about finding historical information about Tesla and his inventions. I was going to say the only thing missing in this fantasy trip was an alien abduction, but the author did one better, he said that Tesla was an alien from outer space. This book should be branded pure fiction written by an author living in LA LA land. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!"
1,A book full of pseudoscience and conspiracy theories,"That Tesla was a great scientist and inventor I won't argue. However, this book isn't about that Tesla. Instead, it leverages off the fact that he could be a bit eccentric and uses some of his crazier ideas to push pseudoscience and conspiracy theories. For those who enjoy well-written English, the book's many grammatical and punctuation errors will likely be quite painful - it was obviously not professionally edited."
1,Pure fiction,"This book is pure fiction, and very poorly written fiction at that. The book was unfortunately also very poorly edited; there are misspellings and grammatical errors throughout the book, and the font used is ridiculously large. You won't learn anything about the real Tesla or his experiments from this thing, but it might be useful as a compendium of crackpot conspiracy theories about him. It is entertaining, but hardly worth the $21."
2,Book A Little Biased to the Conspiracy Theorist,I was disappointed in this book. I was hoping for a biography and an introduction on N. Tesla.. It is mostly a book full of one to two page 'essays' on N. Tesla's work and work related events..
3,PUH-lease,In regards to the above two reviews: It's really tacky and obvious to slip in an advertisement of one's own book under the guise of reviewing another book.
5,A deeply insightful book,"This important book opens your mind and increases your awareness to the fact that there are problems that people experience caused by factors beyond your control. A deeply insightful book. - Brian Tracy, Author ""Psychology of Achievement,"" ""Science of Self-Confidence,"" ""Peak Performance Woman,"" ""Pathways Towards Personal Progress"""
4,I'm against America,The only thing I like about this statue is seeing the bald eagle it looks so cool and ferrous. As far as the two U.S. flags they can kiss my @$$
1,A great door stopper,I happened to trip over this book at a friend's place. Quite literally as it was on the floor being used as a door stopper. It seems that the 50 books the publisher had printed failed to sell and they were giving them away as door stoppers.It saddens me to know that good healthy trees were wasted printing this dribble. Was the publisher awake when it approved this poor excuse for writing. Surely there could have been better uses for the paper.. say instructions on cleaning dog turds off your shoes.. as that is what it felt like to read 2 pages.. yes 2 as that is all i could get through before i began to feel ill.I have already spent too much time of my life on this waste of space.. I just wanted to warn other readers to completely ignore Cold River as it is rubbish.Reviewer
3,revised review,"OK i was a bit harsh on this last time out. I have two gripes..sound quality on disc1, tightness of band, mostly on disc1. I would give disc1 2 out of 5, disc 2 4 out of 5. Little Johnny Jewel is flippin great.I have had the pleasure of seeing the boys in a live gig, just a few days ago, april 16th in Dublin. A great concert, which i am now kicking myself that i didn't record. They played 6 songs from their 92 album, 1 from adventure(glory), 4 from marquee moon also 'petit johnny jewel'. I'll probably never see them in action again"
2,Good music but poor recording,It must have been a great show in 1978 but the poor quality of recording is disappointing. As I am a fan of Tom Verlaine the sound does not matter too much to me but if you want to discover Television as a great rock and roll band you should buy their studio CDs that is Marquee Moon or Best of Television instead of this one.You can also try to find some CDs which are not available at amazon.com like the one of 78 (red cover with a picture of the band) or the more recent 92 CD.
3,Query for Fans,I've heard the original issue of this album was marred by terrible sound quality. This new version was supposedly remastered and re-edited. Does it sound significantly better? Or does the same sound problem exist?
2,sloppy and uneven.,"It was a disappointment. Disc1 contains the shorter songs, disc2 longer songs. Disc1 is a waste of space. This is some of the sloppiest sounding live music i have on cd. Or maybe that's the punk aesthetic-it has to sound raw. Verlaine's singing of the tunes is atrocious and unforgivable. They do a terrible cover of knockin on heaven's door. see no evil is abominable. I missed the punk era (being way too young and from Ireland) but i reckon i didn't miss much in terms of live performance. The liner notes make out that what Television was all about was their live performances.Maybe, but don't try and tell me that this is anywhere close to the studio stuff. All of the songs sound better on the albums (mm and adventure). As for disc 2, it is not much better than disc1. Little Johnny Jewel has some nice guitar as does marquee moon. friction is ok. satisfaction is ok. a bit of a waste of money. Thank you."
4,The Invasion Continues!,"Americans are so asleep today they would not see the comparison of the ""bonus feature"" with Jack Webb where the Commies bust in and Jack Kelly says, ""Where's your search warrant""? To which the Commies reply, ""We don't need a search warrant!"" Under current Bush doctine, for our ""protection"" from ""terrorists"", the Feds have, do and will search and seize without warrants. Habeus Corpus out the window.This is a great cold war wake-up for Americans in 1952. What will wake US up today?"
1,"Bad, bad, bad. Chuck you can do better than this!","This movie was, in a word-""goofball."" However I do own it and my friends and I get a kick out of watching it now and then. This one, like Lone Wolf Mcquade stretches your believability meter to the limit, but this one will surely break it-gauranteed. Chuck is always in the right place at the right time when the perps are doing a number and pulls off one unbelievable stunt after another. The only difference between this and the other Chuck classics is that the bad guys acting is as wooden as his. Rent it first."
2,BATTERY LIFE AND THE SYMBIAN OS SUCKS!!!,"I never liked nokia for the very high response time it takes for every operation. After three years I thought let me give it a try but I'm mistaken. The phone has all the features you can think of like 3G,bluetooth,nice mp3 player, cool camera...but it is damn slow and on top of this the batter life sucks...I have to recharge this damn thing every single night before I go to bed else it will be dead the next day.(I talk around one hour per day and keep the bluetooth off)..Even opening the call list takes around 2-3 seconds.. which is not at all acceptable in this era!"
2,Nothing to get worked up about,"I normally enjoy this type of thing , but this guy's voice is hilarious. He sounds way to much like taz from Looney tunes. It's true. I saw the video for the single (beloved and the hated) and he looks like an extra member of green day, with all that eyeliner and drainpipe black pants. It's unintentionally funny, like they're trying to take the piss out of real emo bands. The guitarist sings the clean vocals and has such a sweet innocent face, with big gooey puppy dog eyes that say `I don't really know what I'm doing here, but these guys might hurt me, I'll just play along for now...Help me somebody!'. I'm not saying there not enjoyable in their own way, just for me, they'll always guarantee a good laugh. Rammstein would eat them alive."
5,sounds nothing like killswitch,"a lot more variation in the songs, a lot less repetitive in the lyrics, longer songs, the ""screaming"" vocals are a lot more brutal and the clean vocals sound nohting like killswitch. if you think they sound like them then your a ****ing moron, plain and simple.anyway, i really like this cd. It's very very agressive, a lot more heavy and faster than the other so called ""metalcore"" bands. Sometimes the vocalist soundliske heaven shall burn or solient greeen. basically, this is the non commerical ""metal core""whatever, i'm tired of writing. i like it and that's all that matters. **** you."
2,Stop Copying Killswitch Caliban,"I can't believe more people have not picked this out. Caliban is stealing their music from Killswitch. Listen to the song The Beloved And The Hatred, then listen to Killswitch's Numbered days. It is an exact copy with different lyrics. To the second the talking screaming and singing are the same. What's the difference? there are two... 1) Killswitch made Numbered Days way before The Beloved And The Hatred, 2) Caliban's singer could only dream of singing like Jesse. This is not the only ripoff, practically all songs on the album steal from Killswitch. The only reason I give it two stars is because they do have the tallent to make half as good replica songs. This band is a fake. Dont take my word for it though: http://www.metalreview.com/viewreview.aspx?ID=1112"
1,This is not a real represenation of Iranians in LA,"The excessive make-up, the shiny suits, the showy clothes, the Beverly Hills homes choked full of ill-fitting tasteless antiques obviously brought over from Iran. . . . this is not what the average Iranian in LA or elsewhere in the US is like."
1,Where is the Magic in the Flute??? Queen of the Night wasn't,"How disappointed was I when I expected to hear one of the GREATEST Aria's ever written for a ""belle canto"" soprano CUT OFF before it even started?For me there was NO MAGIC in this Flute and as for ""Queen of the Night"" it wasn't even Queen of the Minute!How can a company who tries to emulate an understanding of the ""Classical Music"" enthusiast and offers a sample/preview of a vocal artists/production, barely gets past a musical introduction and gives you under 3 bars of a soprano (in her chest voice) as an enticement to purchase the recording WITHOUT even hearing a hint of a ""belle canto"" note even being uttered!Shame! shame! shame!Amazon you will need to do more than this to capture this ""niche"" market SO don't expect IT to help you get out of debt!I expected SO muc more! Not to mention the discredit you give the performers... well, that would mean yet ANOTHER review!"
5,Excellent Box Set,"I looked around in record stores to find a greatest hits album by Rod Stewart and could never find a one or two disc set that had all the songs I really wanted on it. Finally I jumped on Amazon and found this outstanding four disc set that has everything any casual fan of Rod Stewart fan would want and then some. And unlike many greatest hits CDs I've purchased, the sound quality is outstanding.This is definitely a product well worth the price."
4,"Representative, but not the best material","Storyteller does not contain all of Stewart's best material. In fact, if you want all of Stewart's best songs, then just get his first 4 solo CDs, 4 CDs with The Faces, his CD with Jeff Beck (Truth) and skip Storyteller. I think these 9 CDs - released over just a 4-year period! - rival anything the Stones or Zeppelin ever did.But if you want to hear a representative overview of his career - the good, the bad, and the ugly - then Storyteller is a good buy. Clearly, Stewart is an excellent singer and very talented, and some of his recent CDs (Vagabond Heart) are respectable, but today is generally hack."
4,Even the President needs passion!,"This four CD box set covers Rod Stewart's career up to 1989. It features most of his hits, with the biggest exception being ""Ain't Love a Bitch"", which was a #22 hit in 1978. There are also many notable non-hit songs from throughout his recording career. The collection does a good job of covering all aspects of Rod's musical history. Most of the songs are good, but there are a few I don't care for. Still, the good songs far outnumber the bad songs. Very good collection."
5,Rod Stewart that I can paint with....,"I love this album. I had it on very old tapes and now I have it on CD. The only thing I did not check out is to see if there exists a remastered digital version. This is not but I still love it. Barbara from Boynton Beach, Fl"
5,Fabulous,"This compliation of Rod Stewarts work is the best that there is. I read another person's review of it and they didn't like songs on there from the 80's like, ""Love Touch"" and ""Infatuation"". Well my friend, those songs happen to be icon songs of the 80's. If you don't like ""Pop Rock"", then I suggest you listen to something stupid from the 60's. Rod's best work was done in the 80's and my two favorites of his happen to be ""Love Touch"" and ""Infatuation"" they epitimize the use of synthesizers and guitars riffs to the extreme. So if you have just started your Rod Stewart collection, this is the cd compliation to purchase. After about 1990, Rod's music went to the sewer with his 90's trendy unplugged versions... So if you love 70's and 80's Rod, then buy this, its awesome and in Rod's own words, it will keep you ""Forever Young""."
3,Once upon a time.......,"Once upon a time, Rod Stewart rocked. Unfortunately as he got later into his career, especially in the late 1980s, he slipped into cheesy commercial pop-rock. This storyteller box set definitely documents Rod's career arc. Witness the rockin' songs in the early days of his career such as Every Picture Tells a Story and Mandolin Wind. Even into the early 80s he was still rockin' with Tonight I'm Yours and Young Turks. Then, suddenly by the middle of disc 4, the music Rod was making just flat out stinks...songs like Love Touch and Some Guys Have All the Luck are just 80s garbage. It's too bad that sometime in the 80s Rod stopped being a ""bad boy"" rocker and just turned into another old fart making pop music to keep his career going. I did discover a few gems on here that I had never heard before from the early days with the Faces."
4,8 min Core workouts,This is a fine video for short 8 minute workouts. Once you have done it enough you need to start doing the exercises before the instructor finishes explaining them otherwise you do not get much of a workout. The thigh and bun workouts are quite similar.
3,Pretty good.,"Pretty good workout, I am doing it 5 times a week for about a month now, and I think I might be seeing some results. And the girl who leads the workout is kinda cute, that doesnt hurt."
4,08 minute core workout,"This is a great video, works out many different areas, and some muscles that you didn't even know you had!! haha Have fun"
2,Boring and lacks details,Well I am new to exercising and as a beginner I had a few problems.Firstly it seemes like they were rushing to make the 8min deadline.The lady was not giving details like when to inhale/exhale which I think is very important and was also missing out on a lot of details(I think she was assuming that we all know all the details).Very generic routine's and fails to inspire.Keep looking and I am sure you will find better Dvd's out there.Pass this on.
2,Not as hard as I would have liked...poor quality!,"This is an ok DVD for those of us who are time crunched and I like the fact that it incorporates all types of areas in one tape. But it was only difficult for me the first few times I did it. The arms one was the only part that was consistently hard. The rest, in particular the abs, seemed too easy and did not give me the results I would have liked. Plus...it is pretty low quality and often cuts away during the count, throwing you off if you don't have much rhythm :)"
2,08 minuute abs core workouts,"I was hoping this would be more in line with the original 08 minute abs. There was too much moving around from one side to the other, on your knees, etc. You lose a lot of the 08 minutes that way. The original workout was much better. I found the original on YouTube and have used that one."
2,8 min core workout review,"It's a good workout, but NOT for someone with bad knees. LOTS of lunge type exercises. You also need props in order to upgrade to a more difficult level in the program. Not too fond of that. I bought it for the 8 min abs portion, and I do like that part. Wish it was extended . . ."
4,Exercise cd,Great for a quick workout and you can select which area you want to work on or do them all.
2,The originaly was MUCH better,"I used to have the 8 minute workout (2 disk combo), I used it regularly to keep in shape and it work WONDERS. Now after I had my daughter I was looking to buy the DVDs to get back into shape again; this workout is nothing compared to the original, which was MUCH more intense had you sweating and you could FEEL the burn. This newer version gave me a workout but not to the point that i could feel the burn and I haven't worked out in 9 months!! I understand updating the DVD but they shoudn't have changed the workouts"
4,Effective & Simple,This video provides a simple and effective means of improving muscle tone. It's good for when you want to get in a quick excercise in between the daily errands.
4,great ab workout,this is a great ab workout...I use it in a confined space. A different workout that I would normally do...and I can feel the burn.
5,:08 Min Core Workouts,"I have been doing these exercises for three weeks. I like it that there are three levels to follow. I am doing mainly the basic level, but am already doing some of the intermediate level also. I enjoy the stretching routine afterwards. This DVD is very easy to follow."
3,08 min core workouts,"The 08 min core workout is ok, I would have expected a little more intense workouts, but considering being short on time and wanting a workout you can feel good about doing in a short period of time it serves it purpose"
4,good workout,"So I workout fairly often (3-5 times per week) for about on hour on the elliptical and on some days a 1-3 mile jog and I have been wanting to incorporate weight lifting and toning into my routine. I didn't want to build crazy Madonna-like bulk but just to tone and this video is perfect for that! I love that it's got all body parts in one video: Abs, butt, thighs, arms... And if you do them all it's like its own workout. It offers different levels of difficulty and you can incorporate weights or not. This video is definitely worth it for how much it cost."
4,DVD,"It looks so easy, but when you are done, you will feel the burn, the pain and the work you have done! Thank God it is only 8 minutes! It works, but be prepared to hurt. And as you know, no pain, no gain!"
3,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"THis is definitely not for beginners especially the abs section. The other workouts are OK. So if you are out of shape, think twice before getting this one."
2,BORING!,"Bring back the original. This may be a good workout, but only if you can stick to it. I was bored after doing it a few times and can't find the motivation to keep using it. The Jamie Brenkus series was easy to stick with and fun to do!. I wish they would reissue it."
3,Workout,"I received the DVD in a couple of day. It is a great Core workout, but you have to keep going back to the menu to go to the next segment."
2,Way too short - not 8 minutes,"I did not like this video. For one thing, even though they state that you will be doing each exercise for a certain number of seconds, it isn't true. They start the clock while the instructor is explaining the exercise and you don't actually start the set until there's about 15-20 seconds on the clock, which is nothing I guess once you know the workout well, it's okay, but I really disliked that. I loved the original 8 minute abs and thought this new version didn't come close to the original.I would instead recommend Tammilee Webb's I Want that Body."
5,Great workout!,"I really like this tape for working out at home. There are 5 different series which equals 40 minutes of 8 minutes workouts including stretch. When I can't get to the gym, this is great! I do it 2-3 times a week. Worth the money at an excellent price."
2,"Poor Video Quality, Ok abs routine.","I basically just purchased this as a replacement for the old 8 minute abs video I used to do. The work out seemed fine (not as enthusiastic as the old one, and a bit more boring), but the video and sound quality were so poor I couldn't really use it. Did anyone else have this problem? it may have just been a bad DVD, and I am shipping it back, as that is likely the case."
4,80's all stars + Mexican stereotypes,3 Gringos (funniest man during that century) go into Mexico with their expectations of growing their fame. Something that is repeated even today with gringos (and vice versa) having expectations that are different than reality make it extra entertaining.
3,OK,"I was expecting it to be a little more funny, but it was entertaing enough for the price i paid for it."
5,Finally SOME bonus materials!,"As a long time fan of this movie, I was glad that it FINALLY came to BluRay, & that there was SOME bonus footage released. Of course, I wish there was still more... a Blooper reel would have been fantastic!"
5,Three Amigos,"Excellent transfer. The picture looks great and com'on, it's Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short in their heyday - so good."
2,"Great Movie, Bad DVD","This is definitely one my favorite comodies out there with Steve Martin.Unfortunately, the DVD is pooly made. Watching the movie, the image isn't even stable. There are artifacts that show up on the DVD. In sum it's barely watchable because the transfer to DVD was botched.Also I just tried to contact HBO Home Video and they say they don't even manufacture the movie so they can't provide a refund or replacement. What kind of support is that?"
5,Great every time,"I've seen this movie more times than any other and have loved every minute. A bit of tequila and it's a laugh-fest that you don't want to end. It's full of great quotes that I hear (and use) frequently. Come on, relax, sing along, and enjoy."
5,One of my favorites!,"I enjoy those movie, as do my two oldest children who are 6 and 5 years old! My family finds this movie so amusing! It never gets old to any of us!"
4,Great movie - A MUST!!,"I honestly don't know what ""Mac"" from ""BE"" is talking about. He's obviously an idiot. Are you saying it's as bad as Ishtar? Or what about Kid Colter? I don't suppose you could've done better in Three Amigos....oh that's right, you didn't get a call for a part in the movie... wonder why? Anyway, 3 Amigos is a hilarious movie. Steven Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short. They work great together.....they're hilarious. This is a must for anyone's collection....except ""Mac from ""BE""...who doesn't know what funny is. This movie is a comedic hit!! Buy it TODAY!"
5,Slap-Stick at its best,"This movie is alot of fun! You can't help but like the characters - even the bad guys are really likeable! The humor doesn't rely on anything off-color and the ""kookiness"" is great. If you don't take life too seriously and you want to be entertained when you see a movie, I recommend this flick very highly!"
3,Viva Amigos,"""Three Amigos"" is a special film to me because it was one of the few movies my father took me to see when I was twelve. I've always been a big fan of Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short. So, having all three of them in one movie was a dream come true for me. And when I was twelve, I laughed at it a lot.As an adult, however, I can see that this is a feeble attempt by three funny performers at a feature film. The gags are silly and predictable, the songs are corny, and the script is poor.Even with all its weaknesses, I still can't help liking this film today. The comic trio try very hard to make us laugh, and there are a few genuinely funny moments. So, I would still recommend seeing ""Three Amigos"" if you can imagine yourself as a twelve-year-old watching it."
5,""",,,it's moments, but not too many""?!?!",What do these reviewers know? The entire movie is one hilarious moment
5,So funny,"Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, and Martin Short play three clueless actors that wind up playing for real with some outlaws. They learn how to become heros in order to save the townspeople. Hilarious! Great '80s comedy."
5,Awesome,this is what a blu-ray is. noticed the clartiy. saw things i did not noitce on the dvd. and the sound is even better. thank you amazon for offering this. looking forward to more of the old re-issues on blu-ray
4,"thesis on ""Three Amigos""","A wonderful movie with an all star cast who greatly added to the overall success of this movie. The time, the location, the ambiance of the movie was done exceptionally well. The movie is done so well that a person just watches and enjoys without thinking of what is wrong with this scene, etc. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end and highly recommend it to family and friends."
2,"100% Enjoyable Movie, 30% Blu-ray Quality","I love this movie! I got it first on VHS, then on DVD. Today the Blu-ray came. Very disappointed with the over saturation of the color and the weird purplish hue throughout most of the film. There was also a lot of very grainy backgrounds. Very disturbing. I'll watch the extra 20 minutes of never before seen footage then leave it on my video shelf. I'll be watching the DVD instead."
3,The excluded scenes should have made to a director's cut.,"Watching the deleted scenes of The Three Amigos, showing the inside of a film studio and its boss, a load of parody and criticism of the so called studio system was carelessly taken out of the final print, and that is a shame. There is a clear reference to L. B. Mayer, in regard to the premises of the family theme movies, and needless to say to the reported intimidation carried out by the mogul when he was dealing with actors and technical staff.With so many useless director's cuts around, this one would benefit a lot from the missing scenes, and I suppose they will be never expected to be included in the foreseeable future."
5,A Classic Funny Movie,I have loved this movie since I was a kid. It's one of the few that I can watch over and over again... Like Princess Bride and Galaxy Quest. Good family movie with lots of laughs.
4,The amigos ride again!,"Not quite as hilarious and a little tamer than I remember it from my youth, it is still a great way to spend an evening with some light comedy."
4,Goofy Fun,"This is a clasdic screwball comedy and a cult classic. remember how that movie wasn't a very big hit in its release in 1986, yet all the kids knew all the best lines from it. Yes, it's silly humor, almost vaudeville in its style (that's fine with me, being the vaudeville fan that I am) but well worth a viewing. Too bad it's a barebones DVD with no hidden Easter Eggs like director's commentary or deleted scenes and such. I like that sort of thing, as it enhances your view of the art of film making to see the rationale for remving certain scenes.There was no commentary track from the acrors, either. Have Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short disowned the movie?"
2,Strained at best,"These 3 amigos have all done much better work, elsewhere. I wouldn't waste my time on this one, if I were you."
3,"So, So","I've always liked Steve Martin and Martin Short, even though they've been in some horrible movies. This movie is pretty funny, but I could have missed it with no regrets."
3,It's OK,"I'm not into slapstick humor that much, but this is OK. And that is all I have to say about that."
3,Now feels like an extended SNL skit,"Ah yes memories...and how they fade. John Landis directed this farce about three silent film actors who are fired for demanding more money based on a series of hit movies with the ""Three Amigos"" tag. Unemployed, they accept a job in Mexico, thinking that they will perform a fake shoot-em-up for the townsfolk led by the infamous El Guapo. The three, Lucky (Steve Martin), Dusty (Chevy Chase) and Ned (Martin Short) think infamous means ""more than just famous,"" that is, more famous. Now these guys are not quite as dim as the Three Stooges but they sometimes come close. Although there are a number of humorous gags, the film really isn't well written. At least for adults. Even with three very funny men in the lead, it comes up short. Still it's worth a smile or two, especially for the younger set."
5,A Great Movie,"I would recommend this movie to any SNL addict , Not only because this soon to be CLASIC has three SNL alumni. You will ROFL during AND after this film"
3,Like the movie - HATE the bootleg quality...,"This looks like a bootleg copy produced in Mexico or Hong Kong!I was about to contact the seller and ask if they would send me legitimate copy of the movie we ordered but then I started reading the reviews here and it seems that this REALLY is a retail copy!(?!?!)It only occupies a portion of the screen (no, I'm not just mistaking ""letterbox"" for poor quality - instead of 480p you're getting ~ 320p)and it looks like someone created the disc by setting a camcorder up in front of a screen.There are numerous sections in the film where the left side of the frame is obscured by shadow or the WHOLE SCREEN WIGGLES BACK AND FORTH!"
5,Best Video Quality for the Amigos yet,"This is by far one of the most under rated comedies of all time. and the blu ray transfer is wonderful. Makes full use of my 5.1 surround sound but not annoyingly so, and the video quality is spot on."
3,"Great, funny, movie","One of the best movies we've ever seen. It's hilarious! The quality of the movie is a bit poor. A lot of scenes seem to be jiggling back and forth, like it was a poor copy of the movie. Still a funny movie for the whole family and the price is great!"
2,"Great movie, terrible transfer","I love this movie, but this transfer is horrible. It was taken from a movie print instead of an original copy of the movie, so it's grainy, has serious stability issues, and is generally not pretty. Not only that, but it's letterboxed on the disc, so if you have a 16x9 television, you'll be watching the movie with black bars on all sides of the screen, with the actual picture only taking up 50% of your TV's screen.It's a shame that after all of these years that this movie still hasn't been transfered to DVD or Blu-ray properly. It's terrible that such a classic film has to be represented so poorly."
3,"Great movie, bad DVD","First off, it's a great movie. But this DVD is one of the worst DVDs I have seen of a major motion picture.There are no special features, but it's actually the print of the film that is a problem.First off during the opening titles (and a few other times in the film) the movie shakes and bobs up and down. Then during many of the shots, the far left of the picture has a black line over the print (it looks like the scene is fading out... but only on the far left of the picture and only in particular shots.)Finally, about 3/4 of the way through the closing credits the dvd stops and returns to the menu. No kidding!Anyway, it's the only DVD available right now (4-2-08) and these problems won't destroy your enjoyment of the film, but I thought they were worth noting.)So, if the price sounds good, buy it for the great film and look past the DVD problems."
2,could have been great,this is a very funny movie and it could have been a great family movie but the language is unacceptible.language is why i gave it a lower score
2,Incredibly Overrated,"I didn't see this movie in theatres because I didn't think it looked that good. They couldn't even pull a decent trailer together, as I recall.But I heard people say good things about it. And they kept repeating, ""You HAVE to see the singing cactus scene!"" I kept hearing that the same say I used to hear, ""You have to see the campfire scene in BLAZING SADDLES!"" or ""You have to see the automatic pilot in AIRPLANE!""So I saw THE THREE AMIGOS. There's a campfire scene and the three leads sing and strum a guitar next to the campfire. And a cactus joins in and sings. That's it. There was nothing more to it. For some reason, people found this really funny.I suppose if they found that to be a knee-slapper, the rest of this comedy--as arid as the Mexican landscape in the background--would be equally as hilarious.I like the cast, I like John Landis...but this was not funny."
2,Where're the laffs?,"I love some of the reviews below for this film:""you snobs giving this a poor review need to learn to enjoy a good COMEDY!"",and other similar deathless pronouncements.That's all well and good,but I prefer my comedies to be FUNNY,y'know?Someone else mentioned Ebert's 1 star review--what some may not know is that Chevy Chase agreed with Ebert,telling him ""I don't like it either"".This is just another flat attempt at comedy,with plenty of forced scenes,and a script nearly devoid of any humor whatsoever.I don't think the casting is inspired,but I doubt any collection of all-star comedic actors could do anything worthwhile with the script.This movie reminds me a lot of 'Spies Like Us',another un-funny film from around this time.Chase made a lot of bad choices in the '80s."
1,3 X 0 = 0,"You would think that if you put three of the funniest comic actors in a movie you would come up with a howler. This movie should be shown in movie producing classes as a ""bad chemistry"" classic. These guys don't know what to do with each other. Are they courteously waiting for the other guy to grab the punchline? Are they busting their reps to push a bad script? Do they have the flu, or is this a contract fulfillment deal that makes them turn this half witted plot into a dull, pasty, lifeless drone? I say burn it, and never mention it again."
1,Disappointed in Dog Video,"It was with great enthusiasm that I purchased this Doggie Entertainment DVD after looking at the specifics, however I was greatly disappointed....as was my dog. Apparently there is a ""high volume sound"" that runs throughout the disc that only the dog can hear. And our dog hears the sound but doesn't connect it with what is happening on the TV screen. Consequently he runs around the house like crazy looking for the sound. The only time he shows any interest in the DVD is when a dog actually barks. There are some dogs shown, but many wild animals and birds....and they do not make any sounds. My dog has no interest in zebras and lions. It is virtually a silent DVD and our dog couldn't have cared less....and it was boring for us adults. Our dog actually likes television....especially when barking dogs are on it. But this Doggie Entertainment did absolutely nothing for him. Personally, I feel like I threw my money away purchasing it. The dog thinks so too!"
4,Doggie fun!,My Shih Tzu begins by barking and running up to the speakers and would jump at the screen if it weren't over the fireplace. Then she wears herself out and curls up to sleep. I would have given it five stars but the intro runs to long before the action. Then on the repeat play option it runs through the intro completely again. That intro has no action to it or animal activity.
2,Not so much,"The only part my dog pays any attention to is the barking; her ears perk up and she sniffs the TV for a couple seconds, but that's it. I haven't tried any other dog movies, maybe it works for certain dogs, but not mine."
4,Review from a non-gamer,"The one that came to me from Amazon didn't work at all. No lights, no action. Logitech support was very good about getting me another one.I bought this mouse because I loved my cordless laser, but something interferred with its signal regularly, so I went for the corded model.The G5 is very sensitive, and the three level settings are easy to use. I like that it comes with weights. Feels good in my hand. I do miss the volume control button that was on the cordless model.The reason I gave it four stars instead of five? The only game I play where the mouse makes a difference is a sketching game, and this mouse is terrible for that. I can't draw a curve or a circle to save my life! My 17-year-old wasn't able to, either. That's kind of disappointing. I would still buy the G5 again, though. Laser is great!"
5,"G5 versatile, easy to use",I upgraded from an MX 518. I really like the shift-on-the-fly dpi settings. Makes my gaming much more precise. I still haven't got a good feel for the weight system but the texture surface of the mouse gives you a nice solid grip. The software has more options than I can probably use but doesn't get in the way. Good price from Deal Barn and an excellent product.
5,A Trust-maker,"My family got this mouse just a bit before I went off to college. At home, I used it for gaming, but it was a bit too big and bulky to take with me to school (though I like the size when I don't have space restrictions). Still, it served faithfully at home when I was there and catching up on games, or when I wasn't and my family was just doing standard computing.I've gone through a slew of mice over my college career, and very few even seemed to survive more than a year in my hands. This is the exception, a mouse that has survived all of this time and continues to be a stellar mouse even to this day, a number of years later. This mouse is a trust-maker for Logitech; I have a vast graveyard of mice in a box somewhere, and then this one still working great after all this time. I'm sold on Logitech for all of my future mouse needs, and recommend them to my family and friends whenever they tell me about their 80-some dollar mouse dying after only a year or two of use."
5,Greatest mice ever,This mice has comforable 9 buttons that supports well in all FPS games.u also can change ur dpi anytime.
4,decent,"My Microsoft wireless laser mouse was crapping out. So I took a chance on this G5.Cons: I wish it was a bit higher so I could feel like I was actually resting my hand on it. I'm not super impressed with the texture of the mouse on the side where the thumb buttons are. I would really prefer something smooth.Pros: It responds beautifully. Better than my Microsoft mouse did and I loved that thing. Being a corded mouse helps with gaming but who doesn't know that. I like being able to change the dpi sensitivity. It seems very versatile. It also looks cool.Other thoughts: I game but it usually campaign stuff. I'm not very good playing people online so I don't know enough to say if this mouse is great for it or not. Also, I've never had a mouse with adjustable weights before. Not sure of the advantage but I can definitely tell if it's too light or too heavy.I'm very happy with this purchase."
2,Not at all durable,"I was extremely happy with this mouse after about 6 months of casual gameplay. Then the mouse wheel button went kaput after very little use. Now; at the nine-month mark, there is a short in the wires leading into the mouse. Very disapppointed in this mouse's shelf life considering the money spent. My MS mouse that came with the computer put up with a lot more punishment than this 'gaming' mouse."
3,A good mouse some of the time,This mouse is VERY responsive and nice to use SOME of the time. Other times it has a mind of its own. It takes a little getting used to as it feels a bit like sand paper. So I only gave it 3 stars because it is right down the middle of the road.
3,This mouse didnt stay in my house,I really enjoyed the weight of this mouse but I didn't enjoy that it would accidentally change speeds on me (the speed button is right next to the scroll button). I really didn't like the fit either so I went with the MX-5 and I am very glad I did.
4,"full of features, fairly reliable, sensitivity is a bit fickle","It's a good mouse, but when opening and using some programs on my PC, it increases the sensitivity automatically even when I don't want it to and don't press the adjusting buttons. This problem is fixed when I adjust the sensitivity control on the mouse, but it's still kind of annoying. Still a decent product."
5,Once you go G5 you wont go back,Hands down the best gaming mouse I have ever used. I play a lot of FPS games and the G5 has the smoothest and most accurate tracking I have every used. Plus the extra thumb buttons are in a great location and the ergonomics is perfect for my hand (i.e. medium to large size hand). I would definitely recommend the G5 mouse to any serious gamer.
5,Best mouse out there,"This is simply the best mouse on the market, though I have not tried the G9. I like it so much I have one for home and work. I love the weights and the rough grip. The precision is good and the reliability is much better than other mouses I have owned. Believe me when coding at 2 am and you get frustrated the mouse takes the brunt of my frustration and holds up just fine."
2,Good until the last ___?,"I love this mouse with the weighting and DPI selection. Improved my Call of Duty scoring by 25 to 30%. But---it went dead in the water after 3 weeks of use. Seems to be a problem with some of them. They freeze up cursor-wise. I'm going to try it on another computer (Forum suggestion) and if doesn't work, will return it for replacement."
1,Had to return it,"The mouse feels great, but there is one HUGE problem:it is impossible to use the middle button without accidentally pressing the side scroll buttons too(which makes firefox go forward/back one page, for example).Also, it is 2010 already and Logitech still does not provide Linux support. How can they be so cheap? Just hire __one__ linux programmer to do the job.I am returning this mouse because the middle mouse does not work properly and there are no configuration utilities provided from Logitech. I am not looking forward 2 days of trying different xorg config settings trying to disable the extra buttons."
1,EXPENSIVE GARBAGE DO NOT BUY NO SUPPORT,"This mouse is just TRASH. No support from AMAZON or Logitech for problems that will eventually come up.For the money you would expect a product that can last longer than a few months.Save your money for another corded mouse.I'm happy with logitech for their wireless products so gave this a shot but the fancy braided cord came loose on day 31 after purchase.Now the cord is kinked and frayed and it is a major annoyance making the mouse pretty much useless.Logitech email support is down, you can call them and get put on hold for an hour on your own dime.I expect better customer support for such an expensive product.My last logitech purchase."
4,Logitech NEW G5 Laser Mouse,"I have been using a logitech wireless laser mouse for around 4 years now. The wireless was a bit clunky for gaming so I looked around for a better mouse. After reading numerous reviews the G5 kept coming out on top. I have used it for about a month now and notice that the tracking is much faster and smoother then my wireless laser mouse. If I had any complaints, my only one would be that it is wired and not a wireless mouse. Besides that, it is a great mouse that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good solid gaming mouse."
5,Great for RSI sufferers,"I am a repetitive strain sufferer who works at at the computer 10+ hours a day. I've tried a ton of mice now, both optical and laser, and even tried using a Wacom Tablet for a while. This has been the one that has helped the most with pain. The profile of the mouse is low which helps to maintain a more natural hand posture. Even though the customizable weight cartridge is meant for gamers, it also works great for RSI since one can play around with the weights until they feel most comfortable. And the precision tracking means less effort trying to move the mouse to the target. Highly recommended."
4,G5 Laser,Great mouse and worth every dollar. 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the texture of the surface on the top. It looks a feels like cracked paint. Not suitable for an electronic precision device.Anyone should have this mouse. Its not only for games as Logitec pitches it.
5,Great mouse,"Great mouse! I had the previous version and loved it. This one adds a button and feels even better to the touch. I now own three for all my computers. I'm not a gamer, but find the precision and on-the-fly sensitivity adjustment helpful for photo work and other exacting tasks. And, it just feels GREAT in the hand. Significantly improves the computing experience."
3,g5,"nice mouse,tracks well and feels better than most.really like that you can adjust sensitivity on the fly.now for the bad,the mouse buttons sometimes double click.if your trying to drag something it well release or try to open it depending on what it is.i use to have same problem with 518 after 6 month use so i thought i give the g5 a try,didn't last 2 weeks before doing it.wish they could fix this problem other than rma it back for another [...] bucks.rick"
3,the MX518 is way better for gaming,"All of the other reviews are positive, so i will get down into the negative aspects:If your mx518 has died recently and you're thinking of upgrading and you feel that the g5 is comparable considering it looks similar, don't be fooled. It's not as grippy as the mx518 in the slightest. Because of this, i found I had to use a lot more sideways pinky strength to keep it in my grip. The mx518, if you were used to that, felt like an excessively clingy girlfriend, but that was good when you had to be accurate and smooth with shooting. Perhaps it's not a problem for people using higher sensitivities, but I play Counter-strike with a lower sensitivity and it just doesn't compare to the aforementioned mouse.The mx-518 was solid and loved by all. Revisit that."
2,Good mouse if you have a pretty big hand,"This mouse is responsive and pretty good for gaming, IF you have a big hand. Otherwise my (not so big) hand gets really really tired after only 15-20 minutes of use. I'll try to return it. Stay away if your hand is not so big."
5,"Worried at first, but store corrected issue.",Originally I was sent a used mouse not in any original packaging. They said I was sent that one by mistake. They sent me a new one right away and I returned the used one.The mouse is fantastic. This is the second one I have bought. First one lasted 4+ years.
4,Very comfortable mouse,Ive had this mouse for about a month now and i love it. The cord doesnt seem to get in the way( with the way i placed my mouse) the weights dont really make a big difference but it does help. the buttons are placed far enough so i dont press both at the same time(side buttons. The design is neat and depending on which mousepad you get it might not glide like it says. i had to get a new mousepad because my cloth one was making it harder to move my mouse. my only downside is the middle buttons i cant seem to press it without messing up or dying in a game. haha but over all its pretty decent.
3,Poor reliability; 3 failures in 2 years of light use.,"April 26th Update: After weeks of hassle Logitech finally replaced this mouse under warranty around the end of March. The replacement worked fine for one month and then stopped tracking and I had to switch back to the one it replaced. I can't recommend this mouse because of its poor reliability. If I could change my rating I would lower it to just one star.///Bought at end of May 2007. First one was defective out of box but promptly replaced by Amazon. After 1yr 9months with only limited use - largely web browsing and no game use - the scroll wheel no longer will scroll up. Good all purpose mouse that seems comfortable and very functional for web use for large and small hands.Cons: Side back/forward buttons awkward to use, wheel has a spongy feel, wheel should not wear out so quickly (if used for intensive gaming I suspect it would have worn out in a few months)."
3,"Great mouse, but not made for a Mac","I love the mouse, but it didn't work with my iBook, until I paid $20 for a little app called Steermouse. Now it works great!"
1,Hurts my hand and wrist!!!!,"I bought this mouse based on the glowing reviews on Amazon, and on several other computer review sites that gave this mouse top marks.Well, I just plugged it in today and my wrist and hand are going numb!!! This has never happened to me in all my years of using a mouse. I am a female and have a small hand and because this mouse has a large hump in its center, its causing my wrist to bend back more and is hurting my wrist and causing my fingers to go numb. The mouse is also rough on the outside and doesn't feel good to me. I spent nearly $50 on this mouse and feel really disappointed. If you have small hands, don't buy this mouse!!!!"
1,$100+ ??,"I've used a G5 mouse for a year before the right button gave out after a drop off my desk. Coming to Amazon.com to get a new one, I was astounded to see this mouse at first $176, now it's lowered to $140!? I bought this very same mouse at Best Buy for about $50 brand new in the box. How in the hell you can justify a markup of this amount is insane. DO NOT buy this mouse for anything over $70 tops, simply a stupid price tag."
2,I pass,"After having may good years with Logitech MX518 and after buying a new computer I thought it was time to upgrade to a game mouse and tried the New G5. Well it didnt take anytime at all for me to realize that was a mistake. The main problem was the lateral/yaw movement was so slow as to drive me crazy! My a wrist and arm was sore after a very short time with this mouse, and of course I tried all kinds of adjustments both with game sensetivity and the weights.I had to bring it back, and exchanged it for the Microsoft Sidewinder Mouse. See my review on that one.I know the G5 has many fans so I will just say mine didn't live up to all the hype. Perhaps I got a bad one.Therefore I suggest you check out some of the other fine gamming mice including the MX518 which I continue to use on my other computer."
1,Great performance but dreadful surface,"Before I ordered this mouse, I read a review about its bad surface. I did not want to believe it and just bought the item. After two days, I decided that I cannot work with it. Anytime I touched it, I got goosebumps.This is sad because technically this mouse is great. The accuracy of the laser sensor is amazing. And the possibility to change the weight is a great feature. However, if you are somewhat sensitive to weird surfaces (I thought I was not at all), better choose a different mouse or try it out at a local retailer.I sent the G5 back to the seller and bought the Logitech MX Revolution, which so far is really a great product."
5,"Nice, Solid Mouse","I am a gamer, and I really like this mouse. The texture of the mouse's surface is rough so it takes a bit of getting used to, but it's very durable and doesn't seem to be wearing out as fast as my old MX900 did. The PTFE feet are marvelous, never have I had a mouse glide so smoothly.The customizable weight is a good idea. I like a heavier mouse so I have all of the largest weights inside the compartment. The cord is an ingenious idea, being woven-wrapped, although it does take more time for the factory-folded kinks to work themselves out because of this.I appreciate the trend back to corded peripherals, as I never found either wireless mice or keyboards to be reliable or responsive enough for gaming. This mouse has excellent response time, being corded, and has performed perfectly so far."
5,My 2 Cents,"The mouse is a very good and sensitive mouse because you can set the sensitivity yourself. I like how you can choose the little weights to place inside your mouse on the bottom side, which lets you customize the feel to where you are happy. If I had to do it all over again I would still buy this mouse. I use it for games that need high precision, counterstrike, to games such as warcraft 3: frozen throne. So if you are in need of a gaming mouse like I was I would definitely whole heartedly recommend this mouse. Good Gaming Everyone."
1,The Cord is a Major Flaw!!!,"Check out some of the other one or two star reviews on this mouse. They mention a cord issue. There is a general theme to all of these complaints including mine... The cord is flawed. The cord is covered in a stiff braided fabric type material. It looks nice. It makes the cord look sturdy and strong when you first buy this mouse. The reality is that the fancy braiding ends up kinking and tightening up on the cord. It ends up fraying and then eventually the cord shorts out. It just happened on my mouse after 6 months. I have a laptop and I travel with it quite often. This cord cannot stand up to being moved or folded up for travel for any length of time. I imagine if you park this thing on your desktop, it would last longer. Unfortunately considering how much this thing costs, there is no excuse for this type of failure. Logitech could care less about this flaw, so once it fails you're on you're own. Buyer beware!"
5,Favorite gaming mouse,"For me, this is by far my favorite. It's the last of the easy to use abs setup mouses that I've come across. Great texture, color, and response."
3,It's certainly a mouse.,"Coming from a MX518 I really didn't like this mouse, and never really grew into it. the tortoiseshell texture is kind of weird, I liked the way it looked esthetically though. cloth cord was a nice upgrade over the one on the MX. So explain something to me, how can I use the 518 for years then hate this, they are literally built on the same body, I find it hard to believe it comes down to the texture, so it must be the laser. I've used laser mice since then and never had a problem but something about this mouse just felt ""off"" I used a g9 and vastly preferred that, though I didn't' like the shape. it's upgrade, the g500 seemed like the perfect mouse, and the only reason I upgraded to the g700 was for the wireless. honestly I kind of miss optical, if I could get the Logitech g700 but with the optical engine of the g400 and the body of a g500, I'd be in mouse heaven."
4,"Overally good, but surface somehow gets sticky","I've used this mouse for over a month. The buttons on the left are quite useful ( which I changed to ""end"" and ""Ctrl"". The only thing I feel bad about this mouse is the sticky surface, whenever my hand gets a little dirty and touches the mouse, the mouse suddenly gets uncomfortable to use. I don't know whether it's my personal issue or what. Overally, this mouse is perfect for gamers. Incredible dpi adjustment and feel."
3,Right-Click Failure,"This was the greatest gaming mouse I had ever used. Simple and ""comfy"". It had a failure of the right button, which would insert a double right-click nearly every other press of the button. Settings and re-installation of the driver did nothing. Other Logitech mice worked fine with the same driver and settings. Logitech of course refused to acknowledge a failure of the device and assumed my settings were inaccurate, regardless my efforts to trouble shoot. I had to quit using it and I would not buy another at this price ... why pay Zippo prices for a Bic lighter?"
3,there aren't enough buttons,there aren't enough buttons. I want more buttons. and the grip isn't as good as the razor mouse.
3,Not what I expected,"Maybe I'm just too accustomed to my cheap mice, but I thought this one felt funny as soon as I started using it. If you use index and middle fingers for Mouse1 Mouse2, then I find my ring finger awkwardly placed on a ridge on the side.Again, I'm probably just used to cheap mice, but the multiple sensitivity settings don't do a thing for me. In fact, I programmed it to only function on one sensitivity level.Lastly, the mouse wheel itself works, but pressing it down does not register as another button (what, mouse 5?). Yes, I've got drivers installed and played with all the advanced settings I can find.Overall, not a bad mouse, but I could live without it."
1,Disapointing uebermouse - old MS Mouse more accurate,"I wanted a mouse to help improve game play on Neopets flash games, accurate and quick clicking is essential.With all the adjustments possible with G5, it's impossible to use, even in standard programs, having to click twice to select and option, readjust on drop downs... it just doesn't click where it's supposed to.This might be a good mouse for action software, I haven't tried that, but for the games I play this mouse is useless.After using it for a frustrating 6 weeks, I tried MS Wheel Mouse Optical USB 3902C693 and it's simply amazing. Of course it's an obsolete mouse you can only buy used on e-bay."
5,The perfect mouse,"I just bought my third G5 (this new blue one) for a new laptop. I've had two of the original G5s (one on my work PC and the other on my home desktop machine) for over two years. I do a lot of photo editing, and these G5s feel perfect to me. Being able to adjust the weight to individual taste, and being able to change speeds at the touch of a button, are brilliant touches."
4,Very good mouse,"This is a very good mouse. I love the side buttons, it's great for gaming. But users with small hands (kids, for example) may find it a little too big. I am a guy with an average sized hand, and sometimes I have to move my hand forward so that my thumb will reach the second side button. That's the only reason why I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5.All in all, best mouse I've ever owned. But I'd suggest you try it before you buy it, to make sure it fits your hand comfortably."
3,may think twice,"I brought the same G5 old version a year ago and it stoped working. So I buy this new mouse to replace the old one. It was pretyt much the same, accurate and smooth. The only reason I give 3 out of 5 star is because of the plastic cover. It is not good for people with sweaty hands, it stinks the mouse and needs regular cleaning. I wonder who designed this NEW mouse which looks worse than the old version. It is a decent deal, only if, you can stand the ugly outlook and the smell of sweat. (Infact, I wouldnt have brought it if I knew this before.)"
3,Pilates DVD,"Good routine, but the DVD should have included a couple of routines at each level. One quick routine at each level does not justify the purchase."
5,08 min abs,"This video truley gets the workout done in different 08 min segments. Who doesnt have 08 min's to dedicate to toning your body. Do all of them, only a few or just one piece. It has the exercises that really work in a short period of time."
4,Rescue 471: A Paramedic's Stories,"I give this book at least 4 thumbs up. This book is very realistic to the world of EMS, which is why I enjoyed it."
5,enthralling!,"I began reading this book while working my own shift (EMT-I, not a paramedic unfortunately) and as soon as a call came in I didn't want the put the book down and go! (but I did, of coarse!) Canning is able to maintain intensity in his stories throughout the entire book. This is a good chance for current and aspiring EMS personnel to get an idea of the wide range of calls medics receive"
1,the book needs 911,"the author should have stayed in the insurance business. nothing like the great med books out there and there's plenty to choose from. should have kept it about the rescue's themselves, not his partner's like of nude beaching with his family."
5,Rescue 471,"I really liked this book,it is a very straight forward book, several harsh words used through out the book,it was written as patients stated it. Was hard to put down."
5,Captivating!,"I could not put this book down. Peter Canning does a great job of allowing readers to see his world with his honest and gritty writing. His straight off the cuff storytelling style allows readers to truly feel and relate to his joy, sorrow and frustration throughout the book, whether he's describing a gory scene or personal challenge. I highly recommend this book for anyone in the trauma/rescue field as well as those who are curious about life as a paramedic."
4,the benchside into to fly tying,"I'm just started to tying flies and the way this book breaks everthing down is wounderful. It's very nice that the pages are seprated top and bottom so you can see the fly and then look up on how to completed one step, this is a must for anyone just starting. I think the authors did a great job, I really like that it sprial bound that way it lays flat."
5,FLY TYING MADE EASY,"This is one of the most interesting books on fly tying I have ever read, breaks its down so the very beginner can just pick it up. I was having problems in the past with all the flys and the elements that went into making a fly, but with this book it was all spelled out very plain.As far as I am concerned this is a must read for all beginners.Victor Akopian"
5,Benchside is great!,I finally got a chance to use this great book last week. I had taken a fly tying class earlier this year and couldn't remember how to tie a couple of flies. The book is well written and gives precise instructions - with pictures - on how to tie each and every fly. The instructions are easy to follow. This is a must have for any person who ties flies!!
5,Great Starting Point,The book is a great place for brginners to start learning and doing. I had not tied a fly for many years - used the book to review tools and techniques - got restarted quickly. The back and forth referencing throughout is a great way to keep you informed and on track.
1,Not good,It's not all that great dose not cut good at all. You have to run it thro your hair 2 or 3 times before it cuts watse will have to buy new ones again
1,CHEAP and LOUD,"I've been using WAHL clippers for the last 15 years, and this is by far the worst. All of the screws on the clipper vibrate loose after about 5 minutes of use and then it gets loud enough to make your ears ring. I even tried tightening all of them again, but they all vibrated loose again. I'll be looking for a different brand."
1,Failed to perform,"Upon receiving this unit, I had my hair cut with it. The piece failed miserably with multiple painful snags and a haircut that used to take maybe 5 minutes nearly 30. Details of the haircut is longest length was maybe an inch cutting down to a 1/4. Yes, pretty much failed a buzz cut."
1,What A Horrible Lemon,"I bought this product to cut hair and on the cover was "" Quiet But Powerful"". Yeah and I have a peice of moon property to sell you...I should have suspected from the inferior casing and badly packed pieces just thrown in at random with no contoured or individual spaces.This thing is LOUD, VIBRATES worse than a badly packed washing machine and needs 4 or 5 passes to cut hair! It leaves your wrist sore from the vibration and ears numb from the noise.If you handle chain saws then this is for you, if you want something quiet, friendly that doesn't scare your child then look elsewhere... I know I am.What a piece of junk!"
1,Pulls Hair and Unalignable,"I order this and was delighted with its appearance, but it literall jerked my hairs out and was excruciating, even with a high pain tolerance. I tried various times unsuccessfully to correct this by oiling and following the mbiguous ""instructions"" and ""diagrams"" on how to align the blades, but nothing helped.Have returned to my barber at $10/per cut."
2,Unsatified with present Wahl Clippers,I had a Wahl Clipper pair before. It was a good pair of clippers. The pair I owned previously was white and black as pictured in your ad. That was the pair I wanted again. The pair I have now does not perform like the previous pair. So I'm stuck with the pair Ihave
3,Pull on the hair? True.,"One of the review below says ""What they do is pull on the hair.""It was true. I have bought it recently. My girlfriend cut my hair yesterday. The clipper often bit my hair (not cutting but biting!), which was slightly hurting.Although the other things was good, the biting made me uncomfortable."
4,Must have,I am a student on budget and the Wahl clipper saves me about $180 a year + no waiting and no tipping. When not in use keep the clipper outside the bathroom. The dank air makes it rusty.
4,very good product.,The price is unbeatable. Easy to use and effective. Simply a well-designed product. Recommended.
1,Try some other product!,"I purchased this Clipper last year as a back-up for my old Wahl Clipper which I thought might be nearing the end of its life. My old clipper died this week (after YEARS of use), and I opened this replacement model. Even the outside case was inferior in quality to my old model, and when I turned it on, it hummed feebly, but would not actually cut hair. Beware."
1,Did not like,Out of the box teeth did not move - realigned teeth - oiled - turned up power teeth moved noise very loud.scratched neck pulled hair so I went back to old clipper. I have been using trimmers for 15 + years its probably one bad out of 100 but I got it so a bad review I had Wahl and Sunbeam in the past they worked great.
5,Excellent product at a very reasonable price,"My two sons have been getting haircuts at a total monthly cost of about $25. Both of them like short haircuts. After many years of seeing these ""hairdressers"" effortlessly using their clippers, I decided I would try to do it myself. All I needed to know was what ""numbers"" were being used to cut their hair. My older son likes a ""#1"" on the side and a ""#3"" on top. After doing that, I blend it together (the video shows you how) and voila! A haircut just as good as from the shop. My boys liked their haircuts so much, they told me they want me to cut their hair every time. As a bonus for me, my 14 year old asked me if he could give me a haircut. I said ""Sure, why not."" He did a great job. (I let my wife ""clean up"" my neck and around my ears). For the cost of slightly more than one month of haircuts, these Wahl clippers will give us years of haircuts for free!"
2,poor clippers,Was impressed by the attachments and the how-to video but the clippers were of poor quality and pulled on hair rather than cutting it. My 5 year old was in tears within 30 seconds of use. I returned mine for a refund. Make sure you test clippers before buying it
1,Looking for a clipper? Look elsewhere!,"For about the past 12 years, my wife has been cutting my hair. Normally, I keep my hair short in a crew cut, which makes cutting it a snap.We had an older Wahl clipper which did the job quickly and painlessly. But, it's getting on in years, so when this turned up in my gold box, I jumped on it.What a horrible mistake.These clippers simply don't clip. What they do is pull on the hair. They rip the hair out. They hurt! I wind up flinching with each pass as my wife cuts my hair. In the past, haircuts simply weren't a big deal. Now, we both dread them.My wife has to move so slowly with these clippers (so that the hair gets clipped and not yanked out) that what normally takes about 5 minutes now takes 20+.If you're looking for a good set of hair clippers, pass on these."
5,"Good deal, return of it bites","One haircut for my husband, another for my son, and the set was paid for. Not too loud, either. Lots of combs, clips and even a nice pair of scissors make this set an incredible value.As described in other reviews, my first set was also biting. I tried to adjust the blades to avoid this, and found that the white plastic piece that holds the second, inner blade was not installed at an angle, which made it impossible for the two blades to align. Because it was more than 30 days since I received the set, I returned in directly to Wahl, who VERY promptly sent me a replacement set that is perfect."
3,Oldie,"This is a reprint of a 1936-original. It has a brief four-language introduction (german, english, french and spanish) and presents over 30.000 wood names. It was put together with German thoroughness and it is nice to have this back in print. However the user should note that current wood name databases contain well over 100.000 names (try the USDA FPL-site) and that quite a few of the botanical names have changed. In common with all such listings this book does not report the language the name is used in, nor the derivation."
4,Coolest CD of the season!,"I love this CD - it's a great mix of old school tunes remixed for today. It's really a fun CD. Old and young can listen and enjoy, without the hearing the same old stale staple of holiday songs. I rarely give out 5 stars, but this one is a really solid 4.Faves for me are #1, 3, 9 and 12."
5,A Classic,"This is destined to become one of the great Christmas collections of all time. A fantastic, genre-busting tour de force. I can't wait for next year's follow-up."
1,holiday classis re-duced!,"classics reduced to annoying pseudo-disco/house tracks. i couldn't even bring myself to listen to the entire cd, it was so bad!"
5,Excellent!,"It has everything we ever wanted in the basic dictionary and more. It is colorful, pictorial, and it has everything we would ever want to translate for basic daily living. It is a good investment."
2,"Extremely dry recording, Muti's direction is lifeless...","What a disaster, you would think Ricardo Muti, a good opera conductor, would do well with this recording, but his conducting is so terrible, it's shameful. The only good member in the cast is Margaret Price's Countess. Allen's Figaro is not only wrong, he cannot even get the notes right. Kathleen Battle is at her worst here. And Murray's Cherubino is way to ""breathy"" and easily forgettable. The sets with Bohm and Giulini are excellent. Don't buy Solti though, since Solti, like Muti, tends to miss the charm of this opera."
4,a grateful mom,"My son can't stop watching House Construction Ahead! It's a good thing the music is so upbeat and great to listen to, because I have to play this movie for him at least 3 times a day. It not only shows how a house is made, but also shows where materials used to construct a house come from. My son's favorite part (and mine too, I must admit) is the blasting scene at the rock quarry. Watching what goes into building a house is really interesting to see, and this movie presents it in a fun and engaging way. The host is excellent, and explains things in really kid-friendly terms. Forget Bob the Builder - this is one video you could put up with playing over and over and over......"
5,edger blades,"I received my edger blade in a timely manner, and I was so surprised to get it because this blade is so hard to find.Thank youHoward"
2,"Looks great, not practical","My fourth grade son picked this out based on the Pirates theme. The colors are just as advertised and it really looks nice. However, I would advise you to look at the dimensions pretty carefully to make sure that it works as a lunchbox! We did not look at the specs carefully enough and learned upon receipt that (as a lunchbox) it is not really practical. We'll use it to store toys for trips in the car."
1,Worst game ever played,"i was so pumped when i bought this game because my friend has it for PS2 and its sick so i didnt even read the reviews. dont make my mistake. this game is not a 1st person shooter like the ps2 version, instead it is a stratgy game like risk or something just with drugs. you dont actually get to shoot anyone, the computer does that for you. Do not buy this game."
1,Scarface Money Power Respect,"I paid 40 bucks for this game and you can't do anything with it. All you ever do is pick different turfs for fake people to go out and shoot at each other, but you the player can do NOTHING. Major waste of money."
3,A different kind of game.,This game overall is fun. It is not a first person shooter. Instead it is a strategy game based on the movie in the story mode. There is a lot of cursing which makes it entertaining and each time you complete a scene it unlocks a movie clip. You can basically watch the entire movie. Overall not bad.
1,Top 5 Worst Games,Honestly dont bother. im glad i got this game as a trade for my lords of dogtown umd that came with my psp cause i didnt waste 40 bucks on it. i would still rather have my movie it would be way more entertaining than this.
2,"It's okay, More of strategy game","I also thought that would you play as Tony killing and shooting like in GTA, but it was kinda disappointing. I still like it because it's a game of strategy. So if you like strategy it's not bad, if you like shooting go with GTA either Vice city or LIberty City. One game that has both though, was Samurai Warriors where it does require strategy but then you can play as a character and kill, take over stuff. Great game!"
3,Great for the collector!,"This game is great for the Scarface collector. It shows the movie as you go through out the game. It doesnt seem to make you do very much, for which I only gave it 3 stars.. still cool though, but more a movie than a game."
1,"If I could give it a ""0"" I would","Worst. GAME. EVER. That pretty much sums it up. I tried for 2 days (4hrs each Day to give it a chance. All you get to see are cut scenes at random, in no specific order, and some gaming graphics that resemble an NES games from the early 90's. THAT. IS . ITAlso, I paid $10.00 for this stupid game. And guess what??? Amazon wouldn't take it back, and I ended up trading it for.....$1.25 ... Not only will you feel the huge let down that this games becomes quickly, but it will take your money and rip you off too."
2,Not what you think...,"After watching the commericals I thought the playbility was like the GTA series. Not quite. It is like Risk with drugs. I am disappointed in this game. Lots of cussin and movie clips then a ""Risk like"" game board. Then more cussin' and movies then back to the Risk board. Mega boring, however, I should have know this when I saw the Sierra Games logo. That is the universal gaming logo for ""Wait until it hits the dollar bin""Bottome line: Not recommended for folks that like GTA like playability."
2,Not Enough Action,"You Don't Get To fight, You Make Deals and Set Up Deals Buy Drugs But The Game Does The Fighting Taking The Fun Out That Really Sucks"
2,Waste of my time and money!,"I bought this game online for my spouse cause he is a scarface freak and you cant seem to find PSP games anywhere anymore. When I recieved the game it was not the same scarface action game that is for the bigger systems like PS3 and XBOX360 it was some strategy game that was nothing like the other one. We were very disappointed because between the cost of the game, tax and shipping we paid $40.00 for a game that never was played. I tried to trade the game at the local game shop and I was offer $2.00 for it. BRAND NEW! I couldn't believe it. I have always been happy with Amazon, but I think that you should check into this game before you buy it online."
4,Scarface money power respect is a good psp game,I really in enjoyed watching the movie and playing Scarface the world is yours on the nintendo wii.The game is overall fun to play.Its a strategy game based on the movie in story mode.It also has movie clips from the movie after you complete a mission.If you own a psp buy this game..
1,THE PSP VERSION IS NOTHING LIKE THE PC VERSION,"I saw the PC reviews and thought for sure that the PSP version would be just like the PC version. I was so wrong. I don't even feel cheated - I feel totally violated. I didn't think that disappointment in a game could feel this bad. This game is ""slap your mamma"" bad.Someone described the game as Risk on drugs. Risk on crack might be a better description.My depression over this game is so severe that I am often unable to go near video game stores for fear of being lied to. I have been so damaged by the lack of fun in this game that I now sit for hours, looking at black walls, in the hopes of regaining the happiness I once got from great video games - CAUSE I'M NOT GETTING IT FROM THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,charming little helper!,"With it's small hard compacted system, I expected nothing more than a glorified calculator. Upon putting batteries into it. I learned that it had alot more charm. It plays gentle music, and gives you a score of how well you can answer math questions. It comes with an instruction booklet which is pretty helpful. The basic training test will give you 100 questions to answer. (I very much enjoyed this.) then there is an advanced training test that will see your abilities on counting, focusing on numbers, and memory.Overall, it's not a bad little gadget. Educational, The best thing about it is that it keeps track of how you've been doing test wise. It actually graphs your improvements and faults so you can keep track."
4,Brain Trainer,"As with the muscles in your arms/legs/back, you think you're in pretty good shape until you spend a day in the garden. So too, your brain, until you see the evaluation results after using the Brain Trainer. I think I'll sign up for that Calculus refresher course!"
1,worst low impact that I own,"I need low impact aerobics because of my knee joints, but this one will never be used. The film production is poor quality. It looks unprofessional and sometimes cuts off the feet of the instructor so you can't see what she is doing. There are four people doing the routine, all with zero personality. There is no motivation, no jokes, no encouragement, and the speaker's voice is monotone. There is no way to know what steps are next because the leader tells you the move as she begins to do it, or afterwards. Gilad has low impact tapes and so does Jane Fonda. Both are much better than this one."
4,It's a must for every die hard Kiss fan,"Even though you can be against the war in Irak, this is a typical tribute show made with ""american style"" that is always good to see. I bought because I'm a Kiss fan, but I finally found a good show, good sound, good artists.Kiss, as always, it's the strongest show. Only 3 songs at the end, but all the power put in stage. Kiss is as good as ever, and this is just one of the proves."
3,Saw it in the theatre and...,"I appreciate the artists who played this show for our Marines. Regardless of your opinions on the current war, the armed forces are still in the line of fire and we should always recognize and honor their service. This was a rare show of support from the entertainment industry which is usually too high on it's own self-important horse to say thanks.Now, onto the show...Godsmack and Nuge kick ass, pure and simple.The comedians aren't so great.Ritchie Sambora does a low-key but respectable set.Destiny's Child is smokin' Hot!!But to be honest, the only reason I went out of my way to see it in the theatre was to see KISS on the big screen. Despite the way-too-long patriotic rant from Paul Stanley KISS rules the stage as always. Only three songs, probably not worth the full asking price for this DVD, and KISS fans will skip to these performances anyway. I'd say save your $$$ for the Rock The Nation DVD releasing in December."
2,Seriously? CENSORED???,"I love almost every band on this DVD. Kiss, Godsmack, Sambora, Uncle Ted, you name it, these guys ALL kick ass, and the fact that they did this show says a LOT about their dedication to this country. The best of the best performances, and collaborations here. Just awesome!!!The ONE (huge) drawback to this? Censorship. You'd think I would have bought this thing at Wal-Mart. You just do NOT censor rock concerts, period!!! This takes a HUGE part of the experience from it!!! Sure, you get the idea, but what, are we 12 now? Censoring performances like this is just tacky!!!Petty? Maybe, but let's get real here, I have been to countless shows over the past 10 years, and its just WRONG to censor this stuff. Yeah, maybe taking the nudity out of 'em (flashing) is needed, but seriously, WTF???Do NOT buy this if you're after the REAL experience. Talk about a HUGE disappointment !!!"
4,FBA,I was able to read this in one sitting from start to finish and it gave me all the necessary information on Functional Behavioral Analysis I could need.
1,Ripoff - Functional Assessment ...,"The price for this book was a total ripoff! It's a thin, used book and the charge was $70.00!! I strongly discourage ordering from this source if this is an example of their product and pricing history."
4,swivel seat for car,I bought this swivel seat for my eighty one year old mother who is on the shorter side and has had hip replacement surgery . I thought it may be easier for her to get in and out of the car and it worked . My mother really likes it and it also sits her a little higher in the seat
2,Not What I Had Hoped For,"This article seemed to read better for an educator, then it did for a parent like myself. While there were a few suggestion for coping with changes, they were more generalized than I had hoped. I had hoped this article would give more specific suggestions.However, it has given me an idea or two on how to get started. First of all, I believe that I will share this article with my autistic middle schooler's teachers, as it may answer some of their question and concerns."
2,Vague and empty,"I bought this e document and I found it useless, lacking of any kind of original information and/or tips strategies for anything. Just vague comparisons and the definition of AS don't make it worth the 6$. It basically says all over the place support support support, what is the news here?"
4,Good Unit-Read Here For A Reception Hack,This is a good unit. I use it with a Bubba Keg Grill. However it will work with any type of grill where it'd important to know the temp of the product being cooked and also the temp of the cooking area. If the reception distance is not as far as you'd like there is a very easy and cheap modification you can make. This is the link to it: [...]
4,smoker thermometer,This unit does good job of monitoring the heat chamber as well as the item being smoked or cooked. I rcommended it to a local retailer who carries a different brand but does not have all the features of the Maverick.
5,Can't live without this!!,This was a great bargain! We use a wireless thermometer daily and recommend this one highly.
1,Gotta be a better device out there than this...,"Works great. But I hate it. The transmitter's power switch is inside the battery door, under the pop-off clip/stand device and super inconvenient. IF you enjoy horrible design, this unit is for you. I use it for smoking and grilling, and it is pretty easy to use. WAAAAY easier to use than to turn on and off. Imagine if you had a remote for your tv that had to be opened every time you wanted to turn on the tv - AND it had a belt clip in the way. That's this device. Paid under $40 with shipping, and wish I'd have bought it locally so I could have taken it back for a refund much more easily.[...] shows a pic of the transmitter unit with the back open. The latch is a 1/4 turn plastic screw that falls out of the cover and turns with a coin (or the edge of the wire clip) Lose that screw, you're screwed. Bad news is you handle it 2x every time you cook with this unit. AVOID this device."
2,Would not buy another,Not a true wireless thermometer because the range is nothing close to what they advertise. It will not reach 20ft into the house
4,perfect tool for the job,"This works perfect, eliminates the need to get up and check on the smoker.Distance is pretty good based on my tests.Setting the controls is a little different, I might even have to refer top the manual to get it set (min/max temp's)Edit: My food probe stopped working so I emailed cust service through their web site and they sent me out a new probe no questions."
3,expected a better product,"While overall temp metering seems to be fine, design is lacking.The little door to the on/off switch broke after the second time I used it.Most annoying however is I can't get it to transmit more than 10' away.I even changed batteries and installed new ones. Same result.I do like the dual probe function."
5,Great product and great idea,My husbad bought this thermometer to use when he is grilling or smoking food. It prevents him from constantly going outside to check the food and the temperature on the grill. Great product and it works like a charm everytime!
1,Maverick ET-73 Remote Thermometer,Very disappointed - did not transmit more than 10 feet - and could not lock in on a constant oven temperature
2,"One good year, No company support","I am a avid griller and smoker of meats using my Weber equipment, with which I have been very pleased. I purchased the Maverick a couple of years ago and have used it numerous times in my bullet. Mid last year the thermometer began displaying grossly inaccurate readings, which I later determined to be a result of a bad probe most likely due to crimping. I attempted to contact the company to order replacement parts numerous times without success. Numerous phone calls were placed and not one was ever picked up. If there ever was a business run out of a garage, this one is it! A marginal product offered by a sub-par company."
4,"Great thermometer, but somewhat poor range.","I bought this thermometer for my propane smoker, and it works really well with regards to accurate temperatures, monitoring both food and smoker temps, the alarm functions, and timer.I don't know what I would do without it.My gripes with the product, however, include limited range in my home. I have to be downstairs and near the backyard, but once I move towards the front of the house or upstairs I do NOT get signal. The bad thing with this, is the receiver doesn't TELL me that I lost my signal, so I just keep thinking my temp is stable at the last registered temp (i.e. it just keeps showing 225F). For this reason, I just keep the receiver where I know there's reception.Overall, however, I do like the product and would recommend it to any backyard smoker."
1,breaks quickly,"I have bought two of these now. Both broke within the first year. One or the other of the probes quit working both times. Otherwise it is a very good idea, just wish it lasted more than a year. This year I kept it in a plastic bag, with no batteries in it between uses. The year before I did keep it in the smoker, and it did get wet, but it has a rubber grommet I thought to prevent moisture problems. I will not buy another."
3,on/off switch could be relocated.temp. wires longer,"A coin is needed to remove switch cover,making on/off switch a pain to access. The temp.wires could be a little longer,overall the units seem to work well."
3,Best there is but not that great,Accurate enough.Three things bug me about this product:1. Range is pretty short - as low as 15 or 20 ft when going through the brick wall of my house.2. Alarm temperature range is restricted. The alarm set point min for a Lo temp alarm is 50 and Hi min is 176. This means you can't use the alarms for cold smoking as you would need a Hi alarm in the neighborhood of 100 deg.3. Every time you cycle the power the alarms are reset to the default (50 and 176). Then you have to reset to your desired Hi and Lo alarm points. As the Lo starts at 50 and you might typically want an alarm at around 200 deg for hot smoking this takes a bunch of taps on the button that increments the temp.If I could find a competitor I would buy it.
3,"Good idea, but craftmanship not up to par","I bought this to use while smoking meats in my New Braunfels smoker. The first annoyance was having to open the battery door to turn on the transmitter. Also, being limited to holding the temperature alarm buttons down only allows you to increase the temperature. If you miss the temparature you want, you have to wait for the numbers to start over and cycle up again. The wires definitely need to be longer to reach the lower shelves of most large smokers. Although I was no more than 40 feet from the smoker, the receiver lost the signal and I had to go back to the transmitter, remove the battery door, and restart the transmitter. The on/off buttons should be made more robust. After 1 day of smoking I couldn't turn on the receiver; the switch just bent over. I had to use a paper clip to move the base of the switch to the off position. This product was a great idea, but it needs design improvements to be long lasting."
4,Maverick Thermo,"I've been smoking meats for years. I wish I would have have known about this product a long time ago. I like the convenience of accurately monitoring the inside temperature of the smoker and meat temperature without going outside. I wish the sending unit power switch was easier to access. It's located under the battery cover. Other wise, I love it!"
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed in this unit purchased from Amazon, used once on my smoker for ribs, next in the oven for a prime rib roast. Oven temp set for 225 F. but the meat probe kept going off the scale with an HHH reading. Looks like the coating over the steel wire going into the probe burned off. Don't waste your money on this unit as it will not hold up."
1,Nice while it worked,"Two months after the purchase, the unit quit working. While it worked it was handy for monitoring the BBQ. The return time expired just before the thing quit."
1,"Cheap, slowly started dieing after a couple hours",I bought this product because I just needed a basic wireless temp probe for my smoker. It seem to work fine when I first got everything going but then the trouble started.- The units alarm for the temperature being out of range never worked right out of the box.- After about 3 hours of smoking I noticed the temperatures hadn't changed. Upon further investigation the unit had to be placed closer (within 10 feet of the sender) to keep sync.- the internal temp probe was discovered to be horribly inaccurate (+ or - about 20 degrees) even when fully inserted into the brisket.- After a second smoking session the units range got so bad that it loses sync even with the sending unit and receiving unit right next to each other.Maybe I just received a bad unit but since it slowly died it is now too late to return it to Amazon. I am throwing it in the trash and buying another brand.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this remote thermometer so I could try smoking tri tips in my propane BBQ. The first thing I noticed, the on/off switch for the transmitter is under the battery cover. That means that you have to remove the battery cover to turn the unit on. After several uses the 'lock' mechanism broke, now the battery cover cannot be replaced. I guess it is time for duct tape.The receiver is hard to setup.Overall I am very disappointed in the quality of the device, why they put the on/off switch under the battery cover escapes me. I guess I went looking for a bargain, unfortunately I found one."
1,Save your money,"I knew this wouldn't have much range and felt I didn't need it, but 25 feet and it loses signal. Very hard to program. Most of the time it keeps temp on the meat, but sometimes fluctuates by 25 degrees or more"
1,Short term use,"I bought the Maverick Wireless BBQ Thermometer set and used it 3 times before both probes gave up on me. I used it in a Kamado Grill with moderate temps, not sure why the probes burnt out."
1,Never worked at all,Never could get it to work. Needed to use a jeweler's screwdriver to just install batteries. Emailed their customer service and was told I might have to buy another receiver.Don't waste your money. The only thing worse was their customer service.
2,Lousy range,"Nice features, lousy results.The range in my dual probe therm is at most 20 feet with unrestricted sight lines. The probe will constantly lose it's signal which will force me to walk the remote back into range or have to reset it altogether. It is a complete pain in the rear to use.The first probe died in it's second use ( I am experienced with these and was careful not to kink the line, get it too hot, or get it wet).The quality control of this product is severely lacking, and I should have sent it back for a refund. Some people have had good results with this therm, but probably just as many or more were like me.Maverick should be ashamed of this product. I would not recommend it to anyone.I gave it 2 stars because it was a great idea."
2,Thermometer,Cables are easily damaged when closing the grill. The slightest crimp will fault the reading and render it useless. Best solution is to drill a few holes in the grill to feed cables through.
2,transmit distance almost defeats purpose of being remote,"I think this type of product is essential for smoking. The basic concept and features are great and work well. Setting the temps can be a pain because of the 1 degree increment ""up only"" where you have to cycle all the way through is a pain.Most importantly, I have a problem getting the receiver to sinc sometimes and loses it sometimes, and it's only sitting 15' away in the kitchen with line of sight to the smoker. I need to work at least in next room or it defeats the purpose of being remote. Also having to remove the battery door for the power switch on the transmitter is just plain dumb. You have to remove the bracket clip, remove the door, just to turn on. With the little plastic ears that clamp on the bracket clip, this will break in short time.product seems overpriced for these issues."
4,A good value but could be easier to use,"This is a must-have for anyone doing serious BBQ and smoking. I use a Weber Smoky Mountain and this helps me keep the interior temperature perfect without peeking.The only negatives are that you have to scroll through all of the available temps to set the alarm. Also you have to open the back of the transmitter to turn it on.Still, it does the job well at a great price."
5,From the Comfort of Home,"No more do I have to run outside and check the temperature of my smoker or it's contents. The Maverick ET-73 is all that was advertised - accurate temperature readings for you smoker and it contents from the comfort of you living room. I don't know how I managed without one of these for as long as I did.Some will grumble about having to open the back of the outside transmitter to turn it on and some won't, like me. It's a small price to pay for 'wireless connectivity' to your smoker.That's all I have to say about that."
5,great thermometer,"I used this for the first time, and it was great. Having a constant read on the meat temp and the temp on my smoker was great. This thing is really a requirement for any extended smokes. Easy to use, set up, and maintain. I highly recommend it."
2,accurate on temp frustrating to use,"I use this thermometer quite frequently for both the BBQ and smoker, and as far as temp reading go it mine shows a 2-3 degree separation between the probes in my kitchen before it touches the meat or grill. Now that should not happen. I also miss the the meat temperature guide on the lower priced versions, this made it easier to see that you hit your temp. So I am chucking this and ordered the lower cost version the Maverick Remote-Check ET-7 Wireless Thermometer with 2 Probes. Easier to use and cost's less."
2,it died...,"Have had this for about a year and a half. It worked well for the time it worked, then one day when needing to smoke a turkey in the winter--it died. the transmitter no longer transmits. No real reason for the death, it worked a few weeks ago."
3,Smoker temp stop working,"I am not sure what has happened. The smoker temp is just showing HHH. I push/pull the probe connection in and out but it just stopped working. I have not checked with the company on how to fix the issue. Also, the remote probe can show a temperature that is not correct until the temperature start changing on the transmitter."
2,its just ok,"Nothing to much wrong with it as it does take temperature. The problem is that it says it works up to 100 feet and mine will not receive anything over 20 feet away, big disappointment."
2,"""Registering"" is a pain, range could be better","The first time I used this I couldn't believe that the remote and the transmitter could be that much different. I discovered that the units were out of range. When I moved several feet closer, the remote picked up the signal. Also, each time you turn on the receiver, you have to ""register"" the two devices all over again. This is done by removing the battery cover on the transmitter and pushing the TX button or turning the switch off and on. That is really clumsy way to sync the devices. Considering the battery cover is in two pieces, it's also stupid. Outside of those two issues, the device does its job."
2,A Pain in the Butt,"This thermometer seems to work OK, but it is a really stupid design, and real pain to use. If nothing else, you have to disassemble the thing, and open the batter compartment to turn it on! In additon, the clip you have to remove to do this is almost impossible to re-attach,Don't buy this pience of junk."
4,Cant beat the price:quality ratio,"Great product for the price! I have no complaints on the distance as it keeps a connection from outside, through the walls and upstairs in my bedroom totaling over 100 feet plus exterior and interior walls.Does what it needs to do! Can't wait to be able to start doing over night smokes and catch some ZZzzz's"
1,Good luck!,"Now I know I should of listened to the bad ratings this got but I ignored. Most of the complaints tended to focus on the probe wires going bad so I was extra careful handling them. My smoker has vent holes to feed them through so I was able to carefully move them around. After 4 cooking sessions, they went bad anyway. 90 day warranty so I'm out of luck. A new set of probes cost as much as a whole new set up. I'm back to mechanical thermometers now."
1,Disappointed,"I have owned this thermometer for just under a year, used it maybe 10 times and the meat probe no longer works. I called Maverick and they said the probe is burned-out and must be replaced, for twelve bucks! They said that this is about the normal life of a probe.The transmitter and remote do work well, but you will have to replace the meat probe often."
3,Not a very good design. We'll see how it holds up.,"Haven't even used it yet and am already frustrated with the design features:1) To turn the transmitter unit on, you have to remove the supplied stand/belt clip and then remove the battery cover (yes, the on/off switch is actually located in the battery compartment).2) You have to ""pair"" the transmitter to the receiver each time you turn it on.3) There is no up/down button to set max temperature. You have to hold the single selection button down and cycle through the advancing temperature until you reach the desired temperature. If you go past, you have to cycle through it all over again.We'll see how it holds up after actual use.I purchased this unit after buying 2 faulty Traeger brand remote sensors. Their's is a great design when it works. Unfortunately, my first unit failed after 3 uses. The second failed on first usage."
5,Maverick temp gauge,"Read about this product in a bbq forum and had to have one. So far I've only used once, but wow! What a difference! No more running back and forth to the pit to make sure the fire and the temp are right. I was able to sit on my couch with a buddy and watch the Texans lose their AFC championship bid until halftime, all the time monitoring my grate temp remotely! HIGHLY recommended for anyone who smokes meats unless you just enjoy constantly going back and forth to your pit."
5,"Great product, GREAT price","I bought this thermometer to use for ""smoking"" my meats. I am very pleased with it and I like the feature that gives you the temp of the smoker and the temp of the meat. I look forward to using it many times during the summer!"
3,TX on-off switch inside battery compartment,"This thermometer has two parts, the transmitter and the receiver. It has a very cheesy method to turn on the transmitter by opening the battery compartment and wearing out the door plastic key. Before you open the battery compartment you also have to pry out the other plastic bracket. There are some very thin 'O' rings that come out when you open the battery compartment.Conclusion: The transmitter is a pain to turn on/off. It is easy to break, and it is easy to lose the 'O"" rings (they are so small that once they fall good luck finding them). Who is the 'smart guy' thought of this?"
5,Backyard BBQ perfect,"I've had this item for over 3 years. No issues at all. I'm looking to buy a new one just in case I need another one for a separate grill running at the same time as my smoker. THIS THING IS AWESOME. Its the best unit you can buy just before getting a professional competition unit which has longer wires and heavier gauge wires. This thing rocks.My only issue is with the range of the wireless receiver. If I walk too far away, it will lose reception and I'll have to walk it back to pick up the signal. Otherwise I'd be sitting in my house thinking the smoker temp was 225 and turns out it was 185!! This really doesn't bother me. Don't be lazy and walk outside every once in a while!!"
1,Did not work,I purchased two Maverick thermometers. The older product I order last summer lasted 6 months. This product failed right out of the box. High temp reading on the food temp probe. The manual states that the high temperature suggest internal shortage. I thought that was strange. I called the support number provided in the instructions. The voice prompt stated that they only have part time support service. Another words they have no support. Returned to Amazon with lessons learned.
3,"Works, but could be better","I have used this product for about a year and a half now, and it does work. The design, as others have referenced could be better. The switch behind the battery door on the transmitter is a pain, but it makes it more water resistant that way I suppose. The wires are too short, which can be difficult depending on your smoker layout. I wish you could set the 'low' alarm for smoker temp higher than 175. I like to keep my smoker temp in a pretty tight range and this means more closely monitoring. And having to roll through alarm temps only one way is a pain. An up AND down scroll would be nice. The bottom line is that this thermometer is ok for backyard smoker, but could be improved."
4,RediChek Wireless Smoker Thermometer,"I have had a smoker for years. Gave up using it because I could never get any of my food to come out like I expected it should. A friend recommended this device to me. Said that the thermometer on my smoker was useless and I needed it to monitor the chamber and meat temperature. I have to admit it made all the difference. On my first try I made the best hunk of smoked pork ever! Also, I find the range for this device is adequate. I recommend this wireless thermometer."
3,OK but some significant flaws,"I would do your homework on these. I was given it as a gift and the temperature aspect of it is fine. What I find very bizarre is that the on/off switch on the main unit is located underneath the battery cover. Kind of a pain. I haven't discovered whether you loose the min/max settings everytime you turn it off - need to investigate. It's not very solid. The instructions were useless but after a bit, I did figure it out.Works, but a bit painful."
2,Design Flaw,In order to turn on the unit one must unscrew the plastic screw and remove the back of the device. The on / off switch is located with the batteries. Furthermore you will need to unsnap the plastic stand in order to get to the screw and open the battery panel - EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO TURN IT ON OR OFF. Very frustrating and I quickly lost the screw to the battery panel.
1,Does not work as advertised.,"At first the unit would only transmit from about an inch away. When I took the batteries out to reset it, it wouldn't transmit at all anymore. Kind of takes away the convenience of having a remote thermometer for my smoker. I will definitely be returning it."
4,Signal a bit weak,"Placed remote sensor in a shed that houses a wood boiler. The shed is about 50ft. from the house so the signal had to go thru the steel barn siding on the side of the shed, travel 50 ft thru the air and then through a plain glass window to the receiver which was sitting on a night stand right inside the window in direct line of sight of the shed. Worked good for 5 days then lost signal. Changed batteries in both units. Started losing signal every day after that so I moved remote sensor to where the boiler pipes come into the basement, which is directly under the receiver. The signal has to only go thru one floor. Works good now. Must be the transmitter weakened a bit after 5 days. I guess the signal doesn't like the steel siding on the shed.John S."
4,Good thermometer set,"I do like this set, although I can't get a reading from the portable one when I am inside my metal building. I have to go outside of it for the reading.."
2,wireless remote not so good,works well except for the wireless part. got today tried it out. can not receive signal from outside to inside of house or garage.ok if in 10 feet or so in same building or outside with it. tried new batteries and restarting numerous times.works great if not wanting to monitor from comforts of inside while smoker outside.
3,Could be better,"I asked for this for Christmas last year and my wife got it for me. It works well but it should have been designed by someone that actually BBQ's more than once a year!It looses your settings when you turn it off and the default temps are useless. Setting them could have been made easier as well. You have to remove the battery cover on the transmitter to even get to the power switch.The receiver also seems to loose connection to the transmitter when I sit at my desk but it keeps it when in the kitchen (my desk is closer to the smoker... but I have lots of electronics running).I gave it three stars as it is priced well and it does work, but I use this at least weekly and it gets frustrating setting it up each time. I will probably replace it with a better one next year."
3,"Good features, poor range","I am just using this for the first time, the features are good, simple to setup. I found the same problem as others with range, it will work in the room just inside the patio door, but not the next room. Kind of limits the ""remote"" capability. I cannot speak for the probe yet, but I have a similar product made by Weber that has been no problem. When I thought it was, they replaced it free of charge no hassles, but it turned out to be a problem that causes me to have to reset that unit frequently."
4,RediChek works as advertised,Worked great the first time I used it. Easy to set up if you read the directions. The on/off switch should be on the exterior of the unit rather than having to remove back cover. Would recommend this unit to anyone who needs one for a smoker.
2,Broken after 1 use,"The unit's functionality is great. Aside from the annoyance of where the on/off switch is on the transmitter, I would be singing praises. However after just one use, it is not measuring the temp properly so it will be returned."
1,Don't Bother,"I got one of these because I thought the idea was great. I occasionally do pork shoulder over night and have to get up every couple of hours to make sure the temperature on the smoker is holding steady. This would allow me not to have to get up, but to have the thermometer tell me when the smoker temperature was out of range. Well, it turned out to be junk!! First, the switch on the receiver broke within a few uses. Second, transmitter/receiver was suppose to have approximately a 100 foot range, but it turned out to be less the 10 inches!! Don' waste your money!!"
1,"Great Idea, poor quality","I purchased this item to smoke my Thanksgiving turkey. The temperature reading on the smoke chamber was off by at least 10 degrees and therefor I regulated the smoking chamber at the incorrect temperature. Additionally, in the final hour of cooking, the reading from the meat probe malfunctioned and and the display began blinked on and off without any reading. I put in an old meat thermometer and discovered my turkey was slightly overdone. I was very upset about this as I had many family members over for dinner. The good news is that everyone enjoyed the turkey anyway."
2,Don't use on a grill,"I admit I purchased it to measure grill temperature and not smoker. Unfortunately, that means I cooked the probe, even though I didn't go over the specified tempertature. Maybe the end touched the grate or something. Anyway, some red stuff oozed out the back and it doesn't work any more. At least I still have the food probe; and I got to get a good idea of how temperature relates to the gas settings bvefore it died."
2,Works for what it is intended,"I'm upgrading my recommendation on this thermometer to a 3/4. I've used it in a offset smoker for multiple cuts of meat and it reads fine. It does have several shortcomings.The clips for the smoker probe are terrible. You will need to find an alternative to the metal clips to get a good reading. I've found a wood block works very well in my offset. Just don't use wood if you are grilling rather than smoking.It's range is also terrible. Line of sight works if there is nothing in between. It does not work at 25 feet through my sliding door, but worse yet does not tell you it is out of range. It just keeps showing the last temperature.Once you learn where to set the receiver because of the range issues it performs well. Given that there are no better alternatives with dual probes this is as good as it gets."
4,works well with some limitations,"Worked fine for me. I didn't have any problems with it pairing. I didn't test the ""distance"" because it worked from my deck to my dining area and that is all I needed. I would like to bring it to my bedroom so I'm going to run some tests and maybe do the antenna mod that is on the net to boost the signal. The smoking results were very good so I believe the temperature was quite accurate."
2,Distance range innacurate,Although we were please with the accuracy ( we test them with other units)we could get any more then 20 feet with only a glass door in betweenitems was return and we purchase the more expensive model by the same maker
4,"I Love It, Until I Hurt It!","This is a great device to monitor both the smoker and the meat temperature. I didn't think I needed the remote indicator, but it's turned out to be a great aid in monitoring and especially great when it's cold outside.I stupidly tried to use it in my grill, neglecting to check the instructions for max temp limits. I think I damaged both the probes. Smoker temp indicates dashes, meat temp doesn't seem right."
3,Respectable with opportunities,"Used for one season on my Weber smoker. Like the fact that the transmitter is all weather and that it seems well made. The probes on the other hand has not been as reliable. The food probe stopped working after three or four uses, but the smoker probe still works fine. Will not automatically buy again when the smoker probe fails but will look again and see if there have been any new products that might be better made."
2,Works Intermittently,"I now have two different Maverick Thermometers. This and an ET-7. Each of them worked good for the first 60 days then quit. Their customer service is poor and the wireless technology they use is intermittent at best. I can get it to connect periodically but after awhile I lose connectivity.I think I speak for the thousands of folks who have invested alot of time and energy into Eggs, Smokers, etc and I'd like to see a top quality wireless unit even if it is 3x as much up front."
4,works like it should...,"I bought this to moniter the temp in my smoker. It came recomended on a bbq website. Works fine, the sending united survived a rainstorm with no problems. The remote reciever will not work when I go in the house, though. It doesn't register the temp untill I am just on the other side of the garage door, about ten feet from the smoker. It would be nice to get one with a stronger signal that will go through walls. This one would be just fine for outside or on the deck, though."
1,The Worst!!,Broke after 3 uses. Great concept but this is a piece of junk. I threw out the packaging so now I am stuck with it. On/off switch broke off the third time I used it. Now it won't turn on. Stay away from this one.
4,IT WORKS - But a few bugs.,"As an amateur smoker/charcuterie enthusiast, this product is a godsend in the winter months (I'm in the Detroit area). But I've found the range not to be the full 100' the manufacturer claims. I've also had the receiver lose connection to the transmitter and it cost me an overcooked porterhouse steak. I replaced the supplied batteries and have not experienced that problem since. In the case of losing connection between units, I've powered down and up the transmitter to re-establish connection. This can be little bothersome since the transmitter power switch is inside the battery compartment of the unit. I'm sure that is to ensure the waterproof quality of the unit. Those bothers, and some weak supplied batteries are my only complaints. I really do enjoy using the unit and the ability to closely monitor my product (and the freedom from freezing my tail off whenever I want to check the smoker and its contents)."
5,super fo the price,These were great for the price although I had issues with the probes burning out well below the outside limit. Customer service sent new ones and solved my issues. Be aware the parameters of the unit are 17-410 degrees. anything above or below will read hhh. I have probes rated to 720 but the unit will not read above 410. It really is not necessary unless you are anal about high heat cooking temps.
5,An Amazing Product,This thermometer was just the ticket for our Thanksgiving bird-a 24 pounder-that smoked for 13 hours on the Weber. The Maverick ET73 allowed me to accurately monitor the temperature of the meat as well as of the grill interior from the comfort of my family room. It performed flawlessly.
2,Poorly designed,"Battery compartment, on off, etc. poorly designed. Temp probes have no protection around the area where the cord meets the probe, so its very easy to break them with a little water. This product is a waste of time."
1,Not User Friendly,"Beyond the fact that the unit failed to function right out of the box, the design, documentation, and defaults are crazy. To turn the unit on you have to remove the battery cover. The cover for the batteries is poorly designed and is difficult to latch. The belt clip will not secure to the receiver unit. The default temperature is 176 degrees and the only way to lower the temperature is to go all the way up to about 390 and start over at 40 degrees or so. And be quick about it, if you hesitate for a few seonds it reverts back to the default of 176 degrees. Even if the unit did work, I would need to read the 24 step directions in the documention every time, no way I can remember all the ""press this, press that..."" There is no KISS principle here!"
3,The Temp,The Temp on this device to the smoker built in thermometer is about 20 degrees. I have to adjust by subtracting the wireless thermometer by 20 degrees. The range is good. The probe to see the internal temperature of the meat is pretty good and acurate. The other probe that measures the air temp again subtract by 20 degrees.
4,Does nice job of doing what is was made for,"Folks are complaining about the on/off switch behind the battery door but its there because as an outdoor product, this is part of the weatherproofing.If you could calibrate the temperature on this unit I would give this 5 stars. It is within 1.5 degrees of this high accuracy unit I have and I wish I culd calibrate to that.The other cool thing is you can order a seperate food probe for 10.00 and use this unit to monitor two meats at once. I use in kitchen too and it very good there, but the cord length is for smoker use more than kitchen use."
3,Good but not great,"This thermometer is a great tool. Its a little quirky in spots. For example on the receiver piece, you have to take the battery cover off to turn it on, not so with the transmitter. Nice and accurate, and the alarm features are pretty nice. The range is not as good as advertised, but perhaps about 50'."
2,Would be a nice product if it had any range...,"This would be a great product if you could use it as a ""Remote Smoker Thermometer"" as the name implies. Range on mine was about 15ft, rendering it almost useless. Since I can't use it for it's intended purpose, what good is it all? Unless you are going to use it like the picture on the box (your smoker right outside your window) I wouldn't recommend it. Also there is a certain order in which you have to turn the units on in order for them to recognize each other. Even turning them on in the suggested order I have problems. It gets frustrating...It is very disappointing that it has these issues, otherwise it would be a real handy gadget & time saver!"
2,Terrible Reception,"I have tried two of these (thought maybe I just received a bad unit the first time around) and both were unable to transmit through my wood frame wall (or even my glass patio door for that matter). The purpose of the wireless unit was to be able to monitor temps from inside, making this unit worthless to me. If you just need something to keep outside for temps, this works fine. I also agree with the other reviewers that complained about the design. The switch being inside the battery compartment on the transmitter (although I understand why for water resistance) is just plain dumb. It may sound picky, but opening that compartment up to turn it on and off and sync the units (which needed re synching several times during my smokes) was inconvenient. I will try the ET-7 in hopes that it has a better transmitter, otherwise I will have to pony up the extra $30 for the ET-732."
1,DIdn't work completely....,"Bought this to work with my smoker. I followed the directions, messed with it several times. The transmitter only put out a signal once at startup, and that only worked occasionally. The remote never received another signal from the transmitter and would eventually show no readings. The transmitter worked fine but I really need the remote capabilities. Returned to seller may get the ET732 in hopes that it's a better product. The ET73 is cheaply made and in my experience doesn't work."
4,Great product,"I commonly cook overnight for long smokes. This thermometer is great. I second the opinions of the other reviewers.There are only 2 reasons I don't give this 5 stars:1) The receiver must be turned on first, then the transmitter. So, if you do lose signal, you can't just power cycle the receiver, you have to go out and power cycle the transmitter too.2) When the unit loses signal (it happens..it's a radio), you cannot set it it alarm!! So, if I'm cooking overnight, and the unit loses signal, I sleep all night without knowing that the pit temperature is still in the right range. I really wish it would alarm when it loses signal.However, those 2 things aside (these are minor), I still give it 4 stars and would not want to live without it."
3,"Display nice, range is almost useless","Supposedly the range stated by Maverick is 100 feet. To me that is a flat out LIE.My smoker is on my patio, I'm sitting in my living room just under 20 feet from the smoker with nothing but a standard brick wall between me and it. Can't get a reading.Luckily I can put the receiver on the fireplace mantle (which makes it only 10 feet from the transmitter) and it reads fine and since the display is nice and large I can read it from my easy chair.So, 100 foot range? MAYBE if you were completely unobstructed in a shielded room. But in real life, not even close."
2,Not great...,"I'm a fairly serious BBQ'er and have had several remote thermometers over the years. This one is a dissapointment. A few problems:1. This one indicated that it comes with two temperature probes thatcan be both used simultaneously. It turns out that one can be used for food and the other has to be used to monitor the ambient temperature in the smoker. I don't know any serious BBQ'er who uses a pit that doesn't have at least one built in temperature gauge. So essentially the second probe is useless for most people.2. The interface for setting the mins and max alarms on the food and smoker is fairly counter intuitive. I had to read the manual a couple of times to figure it out.3. The transmitter and receiver don't always re-bind so you have to go through a binding procedure to get the two talking.4. As other's have observed, you have to remove the battery cover on the transmitter to turn it on and off. And it takes a coin or screw driver to remove the battery cover!? Not great."
1,bbq dud,"Very disappointing. Purchased last summer, worked intermittently. This year receiver reads 150, then 400, 215 then HHH, all within a half hour. Unreliable. Using in smoker with separate fire box."
3,Maverick RediChek Remote Wireless Smoker Thermometer,"Just tried this recently and have mixed feelings.The smoker/meat temp transmitter is good and accurate but seems to have far less than the stated 100'range for the remote reciever.as in 15'away thru a screen (nylon)door and no signal.I am using the batteries that came with the unit so that may be a factor as they are el'cheapo brand.Having a big cook this weekend so I will be testing it out.The timers and the remote,when in range,are excelent and seem to be built well."
1,I Hate Electronics Made In China,"I hope you have better luck with your's then I did , mine broke after turning the main unit off twice, piece of junk micro on/off switch, I will never buy a remote thermometer again, this is the second one I tried and this is a bigger piece of junk then the Weber model, which also died after one use, what a joke.I'd rate it zero if I could but 1 in a minimum"
4,Great product if it would last,"This is the third time I've purchased this product, because it is so useful if you smoke food regularly. I have wood, charcoal, gas and electric smokers and now that I have calibrated the electric smoker using this product, I don't need it as much, but when I use any of the others, I can regulate the temperature much better and know how cooked the food is without opening the lid. The latter is important if I'm on a tight schedule and want to add a glaze.The problem is that I have had to purchase three of them because they stop working after a year or two."
5,Excellent!!,"I have used this many times since I bought it, cooking everything from pork shoulder for 15 hours to beef roast and ribs for 6-12 hours. My next venture will be a brisket. I recommend this for anyone that has interest in smoking foods."
2,Hard to use,I had high hopes for this product but have been disappointed. It is the user guide I am mostly disappointed about. It does not explain things easily and leaves you to your own devices. I would purchase a different product.
1,Don't Buy from this company!!!!!,"The product is OK so far, but I had an awful time with Unbeatable Sale. Not only was the product severely delayed in shipping (due to Unbeatable sale's mistakes), but the customer service rep made no effort to correct the mistake. Only after spending many frusterating days trying to get to the bottom of the issue, did somebody try to fix the problem. I shop a lot on the internet, and this has been by far my worst experience!!!To top it all off, after I reviewed the company poorly via Amazon, Unbeatable Sale has sent me multiple harassing emails, trying to get me to recant my poor rating of them. They have even tried to bribe me by offering to credit me the $50 for the item. I am not a sell out, and I will definately choose warning other internet shoppers about this company over a measly fifty bucks."
1,Terrible waste of money,Don't waste your money on this. You can not turn the sending unit off without opening up the battery compartment so either your batteries will be dead when you use it or you need a screwdriver to open it up every time you use it.Never have I seen a product with the on/off switch buried inside the unit.
1,Broken out of the box,"So I purchased this thinking that so many people have purchased it, it must decent. WRONG AGAIN.Out of the box the transmiter digital LED display scrolls through the smoker and food temp in an endless loop very fast. Thought well, maybe it needs to settle it. Nope, wrong again, its busted. The probes read the temp correctly and the transmitter sends them to the reciever okay, but still the transmitter display is messed up.Going to return it tomorrow. Other complaints:On / off switch in transmitter is inside the battery compartmentTo change tempature setting for the HI/LOW on reciever you have to scroll throught all the highest temp to get to the lowest temp and if you go past your temp, well, scroll more."
2,probes,"probes are not very good and lots of diffrent temps in all probes on there units, Quit using them after about 2 cooks and I bought 2 units. went with regular mechanical probe. this 2 units are thrown in corner somewere, only acouple of the probes even work after a few times of using."
4,Good Product,"The Miracle Electric grain grinder is a good product. It works well and the noise level is very low. when using it to mill defatted seed cake, like the sesame cake that is hard after mechanical oil extraction, it is advisable to first of all break the cake into small pieces and crush using the mill set at a higher number(12) before milling at a low number set. The cake will clog the shaft so there is need to dismantle in-between milling this is very easy to do.The miracle mill has proved that it can be used for a variety of products, so I want to add that it has been used to mill defatted seed cake to powder so that the powder can be used for other purpose."
3,Doesn't grind into fine flour.,"I wanted a mill that wasn't as loud or messy as the one I had. This is a nice and quiet machine. However, in it's finest setting, the wheat flour is still grainy."
4,Miracle Electric Grain & Flour mill-ME300. Insufficient packaging.,"Got the mill fairly fast considering I am in Alaska but the plastic hopper was broken, just a few pieces of paper did not protect it well enough against the 'sloshing around' of the heavy mill. Some bubble wrap or a separator would have been best. Nonetheless I was able to tape it together and I am very happy with the mill."
3,Good unless you want a fine grind w/ no sifiting,"Pros: Fairly quick grinding, easy to assemble/disassemble and clean, small and light and easy to store, reasonably quiet.Cons: I ground soft white wheat berries on the finest setting but still had to sift *twice* to get close to the fineness of my favorite commercial brand, King Arthur. It was still quite gritty."
2,Not your regular LaVyrle Spencer book,"I have read a lot of her books and I picked this one up expecting the same -- well drawn characters and romance without too much sex. However these two stories are mostly sexual tension and some explicit scenes as well. Well, explicit for this author's standards. The second story in particular, I am not sure why the heroine was attracted to the hero in the first place. She suspects him of cheating on the auction bid making her company lose millions, thinks he is a pervert seeing that he carries a porno magazine when he is on a business trip, yet the same day she met him, she has dinner with him. Spencer must have tried writing regular HQ type romances before finding her niche. Not what you would expect from her books."
5,A great chain that lasts,"I ride a Kawasaki ZZR 1200 and have found this to be the best replacement chain that I have tried. They last about 25,000 miles for me and even thought they cost a little more, the mileage I get more then makes up for it, and replacing my chain is not my favorite thing to do. I would rather be riding."
5,this sounds nothing like kalmah,"the guy under said this album is like the style of kalmah. this band features no keyboards and the vocalist GROWLS unlike the kalmah vocalist who screams mechanically. Also, there is a lot of singing in this album. With that said, I would say this album is a more lively and better produced version of old Amorphis. It's great melodic death from Finland. The album personally reminds me of Gardenian's Soulburner. Very similar I would say, except the style is more like Amorphis. I suggest you get it, if you like singing melodic death and growling with good guitar melodies, then this is it."
3,"Good quality connector, difficult to put in wall plate","I have ordered several of these connectors, so that I could use R-6 Coax runs for audio connections in a new construction project. The connectors are high quality, and though I've ordered from several sellers via Amazon, each was shipped promptly with no issues.The problem however, is that the connector does not easily work with any style wall plate that I have tried. I purchased a standard cable plate with barrel connectors and tried to replace the existing barrel connector with this one, but the colored insulators on these connectors do not allow that. The shape is different (oval with two straight sides, as opposed to hex).Good quality product I'm sure - but I may be unable to use them. I have luckily found another supplier that makes F-connector to RCA in a modular faceplate design."
4,This book was one of the better American Novels I have read,"This is a great book about the American Dream and how it changes people. At some points it can be tedious, but after thoroughly reading it over I realized that every little detail is significant in this book. Both of you people who gave it one stars are idiots and deserve repeating the 11th grade."
4,MAXNotes Guide,Another good guide. I would use this guide again. I found it very helpful to use in discussing the novel.
1,This book really sucked,Great Gatsby was a digusting look at how one man's pride and filth can turn a promising country into the cess pool that it has become.
5,Dewalt 12-inch 80 tooth crosscut blade,"I had one of these on my miter saw, and it lasted 8 years! Granted, I am a do it myself-er, so I don't have it in constant use. but 8 years is a long time. I bought one to replace it after I (finally!) dulled up the old one cutting some laminate flooring. I've never been disappointed with this saw/blade combination."
1,i bought the xfps 360 pro,"and i am disappointed. Mine works like it is supposed to. 2 things upset me. 1st is that you can not change the bindings of either analog thumbsticks (such as i wanted to change the movement keys w,a,s,d to the up,down,left,right arrow keys, but can't). 2nd is that the deadzone still exists. The only difference in between the original ""xfps 360"" and the ""xfps 360 pro"" is the color, and the x,y sensitivity adjustments. The deadzone is the same, and really upsets me. Incase u don't know what i mean by ""deadzone"".... when i try to sharpshoot a small target, the little minute adjustments of the mouse are not recognized. I have to move the mouse at least 3 millimeters for the xfps to register it, and by that time the crosshair moves at near full speed. DONT BUY THIS!!!"
2,Ellison's second volume is too much of a good thing.,"Flush with the success of the briliant Dangeraus Visions, Harlan Ellison and his publishers leapt into the creation of a mulit-volume sequel. They should have quit while they were ahead. Most of the stories are good, but they have not dated well. Also the book runs needlessly long, with Ellison's hyper ego prattling on in the introductions and needless double header works by the writers. It took me a year to read it all and, for someone who goes through 3 to 5 books a month, that is NOT praise."
3,Be careful,"My 2 year old received this from her birthday and loves it; however, be careful and cut the loops on the tail, so they don't loop anymore. Her nanny placed it in the crib with her and in the morning the loops were wrapped around her neck and I had to cut them off. They were choking her. I am trying to get hold of the company that makes it to make them aware. She is fine but it was a scare."
4,Perfect Pony for a 2 year old!,I purchased this cute little pony for my niece who lives in another city and sent it to her. It arrived early and in great condition for her birthday party. The hair on the pony is so adorable and really bumped up the rating for me. It's made out of this great material that is squishy and fun for 2 year olds and they get to color it anyway they want. The saddle is also colorable and goes great with the pony. I hope she doesn't start coloring all her animals or else I'm in big trouble! happy birthday Allie!
1,Fell apart in washing machine,"My 5 year old just got this for a birthday present. She loved coloring it. I washed it per the toys directions (in pillowcase, warm water, within 48 hours, no dryer) but it ripped open in two spots while in the washing machine and most of the stuffing came out. It can't be repaired because it didn't even rip on the seams."
3,Riddle,"What's smaller than the picture perceives, skin is very thin, saddle is wrinkley and cheap? Yeah, you guessed it. Color and Cuddle Pony. I was fairly disappointed and wished I hadn't ordered three of them for my grandaugters. Oh, well...live and learn. I think I will stick with Max & Ruby DVD's."
1,Not worth it,It fell apart in the first wash. The fabric it very thin and doesn't hold up well. We didn't like it.
3,Looks better in the picture,Very cute product. The only problem I have is that it looks so cheaply made when you hold it. The picture makes it look much better than in person.
3,Cute but not 100% satified,"Alex Toys Color and Cuddle Washable PonyI bought this pony as a way for my niece's friends to sign as a keepsake for her birthday. When the pony came in the mail, I was a little surprised. I expected it to be made of a washable cloth, but it's more plastic. The pony is soft and squishy but looks cheaply made for the price. I was hoping for something similar to the real doodle animals. It worked out fine, but I wasn't 100% happy with it."
3,My grand daughter is a bright child and enjoys dressing the horse up.,Who ever came up with this iteal is wonderful it helps a child learn there color & sharps. Lets there minds work to help form the horse into bright and pretty colors. I got this for my grand daughter but also went and purchased 3 for my daycare/preschool as well.
3,Not Really Washable,"My daughter likes this - anything horse themed she loves. Discovered, however, that it doesn't wash as well as claimed. She only drew on it once..I washed it as directed & most of the color remained. She still plays with it, so as long as she does I guess it's an OK toy."
5,My daughter loves it.,"I almost didn't buy this Color Pony after seeing reviews suggesting it is low quality. While it is more ""papery"" than a regular plush stuffed animal it is still soft and squishy. My daughter got it from Santa this morning and has colored it several times, written it's name on the leg, washed it herself and rewritten the name. She is in pony heaven. I haven't seen the other brands'color dolls in person, but this one is actually really cute. Perfect for any kid who loves arts and crafts and dolls! (mine is 4)"
1,poorly made,"i bought this as a christmas present for my four year old daughter and was very disappointed when it came. For starters it came in a plastic case that has a zipper across the top, only its not a real zipper, it doesnt even close so the toy was opened when i got it. Then i contiued to look at the toy and it is made of the weirdest fabric, in a bad way, it is almost paper towel like material and seems like it will rip open very easy, not worth half of what i paid for it."
1,"Poor quality, bad copy of Doodle Bear","Terrible quality. Ugly. This is a copy of Fisher Price's Doodle Bear. Stick with the original, its MUCH MUCH better."
4,Suberbly produced and filmed,Sadly entertaining as well as educational. We all too often forget or in the case of our youth in America today never knew how difficult it was for our European ancestors both in their home country and even in America after they arrived. It caused me to appreciate the blessings and health most families in America have always enjoyed from birth. Highly recommend!
3,A valuable set made less so by polemic.,"Phillip Schaff, one of the foremost Protestant church historians over the last 2 centuries, has provided both student and scholar a valuable resource concerning the creedal statements of Christianity for its first 19 centuries. No one with a serious interest in the Early Church or in the development of doctrine should be without this set.However, it must be noted that Schaff had a theological viewpoint which was not only Protestant, but actively anti-Catholic. There are times when he discourses at length against Catholicism, using polemic and derogatory language entirely inappropriate for either a scholar or a clergyman. It is the presence of this abusive and perjorative language which, at times, greatly reduces the value of this set."
1,Waste of money!,"Don't buy this book - it is a waste of money.The title is totally misleading. It does not give any information on how to check out your psychic abilities or any information on how to develop your abilities. It is just a collection of anecdotes (and not very interesting ones either). The format is that of an overview on the subject. I could have written it better myself. You would have to come from another planet to not know most of what is already in this book. It is just general knowledge. So pick a real book, go spend your money on ""Psychic Development for Beginners, An Easy Guide to Releasing and Developing Your Psychic Abilities"" by William Hewitt."
5,A must have Great Classic!,"I bought this for my husband and he loved it. If you like classical opera, this is a must have for your collection."
5,McLane's Standard Fishing Encyclopedia,"If you are a fisherman, you should have this book. I bought this copy for my grandson who is 12 years old and an avid fisherman. I have a copy which I purchased in the mid sixties and have used it extensively over the years. It covers just about anything you ever wanted to know about fish and fishing. It is useful for identifying what you caught, how to catch it, how to filet it, how to cook it,etc. It is conveniently arranged in alphabetical order."
3,The film was better,"Very rarely do u see the filmed version of a book surpass the book itself. This is an exception. The book starts off well but the character development is a bit absurd. Anyway the minituarization is a pretty novel idea, and the ending , quite decent. One star for the cover. Quite innovative."
3,"Fantastic Voyage was exciting, but also hard to understand.",The main character was Grant. He was kind and sweet but was very plain. From reading this book I learned that Isaac Asimov is a great writer.His books are very exciting but are also very hard to understand. In this book all the characters have to have a lot of courage.
4,scientifically heart warming,"My impression of this book at first was that it was going to be a very non adventurous tale of a man leaving to go to a science lab and just completing the regular jobs of a scientist in the late 60's. but having read this book, it shows me that miniaturization is the one major factor in this and how back then that wasn't even thought of. not even lazer surgury of azimov was getting a good review for the upcoming years of this techneque. I really admire his use of all different aspects such as suspence, science, crimality, and romance. i give this 4 and 1/2 stars."
3,A Perfect Story,"This story is about how five people shrink down and go into this scientists body, and try to destroy a blood clot in a scientist's brain with a laser. Throughout the entire book the team uncovers many problems that they must face to complete the mission. The team has only 60 minutes to get to the clot and destroy it, and get out of the body. If they don't get out in time theywill kill Benes and themselves.This book also contains many real world elements, even though it is based in the future. I really liked this book and any sci-fi reader would like it ,too. The book is pretty dirty, there are nine cuss words in the first twelve pages. I would recemned this book more for the older aged group. Again I really enjoyed this because of the action, supence, andthe few serious parts. This book could be just a little better in the begging. The begging is so boring. Thats the way all novels are."
4,conditiong info good product,"good logical order and suited for a variety of ages and needs. charts that are included take the guess work out of making your own. practical approach that can be shared with the player in a way that all can be on the ""same page"" so to speak."
4,A must have for serious pitchers,This manual lives up to the billing. It is full of everything a young pitcher needs to take his game to the next level. In my opinion it is best suited to pitchers just entering high school but it would be helpful to anyone who hasn't been exposed to this material.My only complaint is that I felt a little more text from the author would have been helpful at times when describing exercises or introducing each section of new material. This kept me from rating TuffCuff five stars but overall I am happy with my purchase.One other point to consider is that some of the recommended exercises might require the purchase of home workout equipment such as light weights or exercise balls.
5,"great info, not just for baseball","you could definetly use this year round and apply to just pitching, but it is very easily modified to any baseball position, or other athletes as well. yes, you could basically get a lot of this info from other books, that's plural, meaning more than one. here it is in one book, with charts, sample workouts, schedules for in-season, off season, spring training, fall ball, evything you need. i would recommend some supervision with younger players (junior high and high school) to make sure of proper technique, but once established, very easy for them to take charge of their routine."
4,Better Pitching,The excercises and other features of this book really helped my son be a better pitcher. He was able to pitch more innings without injury and his recovery time was quicker.
3,workout!!,"still working on this book, not sure if it's help or not <week 1>Tomorrow i got a ball game, then i'll know the result from week 1"
5,Tuff Cuff Strength and Conditioning Manual,I found this manual to be an excellent tool to guide my son through the rigors of the proper training techniques for pitchers or anyone who requires extensive use of their rotator cuff. I would strongly recommend purchasing this manual.
3,Good content but cheaply done.,"Has good ""stuff"" in it but looks like it was produced on an office copy machine. That being said, my grandson treats it like it is his bible. He follows the exercise program and nutrition tips on a daily basis for a stronger baseball body."
4,TuffCuff Strength and Conditioning Manual for Baseball Pitchers,I found the manual to be very well laid out.The pictures and explanationsfor each of the drills were easy to understand.I have been using the program in our winter gym sessions and the players not only show improvment but are having fun doing the drills. I would highly recommend this manual to othersJoe Wiwchar
3,Disappointed!,"I was so relieved when I 'found' Big Red last year. With all of the negative hoopla concerning artificial sweetners, I gladly stopped using sugarless gum. Unfortunately, the ingredients in this wonderful tasting gum now include artificial sweeteners, too. So....back to the drawing board."
1,HUH? Please....,Guess I was expecting too much. I've enjoyed other Nevada Barr works but this one is a stinker. I only regret the time I lost trudging through it. I was sure it was going to get better...It didn't. I was loathe to give it one star. Yuck.
1,Not so good,"This is the first Nevada Barr novel that I have read. I found it quite awful. It is hard to believe that she consulted women's journals from the old west help construct this book. The characters were non-believable and lackluster, as were the situations.My bookclub read this book and we all pretty much agree that it stinks."
1,sickening story,"I usually enjoy Nevada Barr books, even though the stories about life in the federal government service is totally fiction, nothing like real life in the service. The fiction is enjoyable. But this book is just disgusting. It is bad enough we see this crap on tv, but to spend all your energy writing and reading this trash is a waste I want my time and money back."
4,I loved this book!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I picked it up on a whim, knowing nothing about it, but when I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I was really moved by the devotion and genuine love between the two main characters, and I still find myself going back and rereading certain passages. I could relate to this book on so many levels, and I recommend it to others."
4,Great Book,"This was a great portrayal of two women who struggled to make a life together during a very difficult time period. The plot was riveting and kept my interest. The characters were not portrayed as stereotypical lesbians, which was a nice change from other novels that I have read. This is a definite change of pace from the Anna Pigeon mysteries I have become used to reading by this author. Sarah and Imogene were great characters. I only have one criticism. Toward the end of the novel, I was flipping to see if I had read something wrong, due to the author's use of pronouns and the name switch that occurred. Overall a great depiction of two women who knew their own strength and used it to their advantage! The scenery was vividly described and the characters well-read."
3,Cool Journey,"Wow! This book was a continual surprise for me. It's really good on so many levels: well-written, great character development, beautifully crafted scenery, and a tricky plot.Two women move west to escape persecution from their lifestyle. Unfortunately when they first move, they haven't actually done anything, but the one woman becomes entangled in the other's affairs. Though this is a novel about the love two women have for eachother the sexual feelings are secondary to simple, mutual caring.Intrigued by the life these women ""lived,"" I several times read the book into the wee hours of morning. It was quite a wonderful journey. I do have one criticism, which is that the end of the book was confusing. I don't want to give anything away, but what the women did to keep the ranch was one thing, the fact that the ""person"" changed names in the narrative was (to me at least) cumbersome reading."
2,3 words - depressing! depressing! depressing!,"Well written, but tragedy filled and depressing with no emotional or romantic payoffs!You are right there with the characters through every tragic event that besets them but you feel as though all the moments of joy, emotional closeness or romance all happen in between chapters in a world you the reader are not invited to share in - it is only eluded to in between tragedies.I really wanted to love this book but but instead felt kind of mad and cheated by the end of it all."
5,Bittersweet,"Bittersweet is a huge departure from the Anna Pigeon novels, but a wonderful ""bittersweet"" window into our past when women had little or no rights at all to anything but marriage. It's a wonderful book about the power of love."
3,"Slow, clunky and overwrought","I realized late that this was Nevada Barr's FIRST novel, not her LATEST. Thank goodness she has learned better plot development since Bittersweet, which she wrote in 1984.The trite title gives it all away. While the characters are well thought-out, consistent and potentially interesting, the plot is graceless and overly contrived. While I wouldn't expect a story about two women becoming lovers in the nineteenth century to be full of rainbows and butterflies, the story focuses primarily on their challenges and tragedies.Unfortunately the two primary characters are also unlikeable. One is a perpetual victim and weakling, and the other is a sexual predator and a liar. Instead of being moved by their struggle and pathos, I just wanted to smack them."
2,Someone get me a gun...,"I thoroughly enjoyed all of Ms. Barr's other works of fiction, but good Lord, this book was depressing. I don't require happy endings to enjoy a book or movie, but this book had me thinking of taking a razor blade to my wrists. I enjoyed the characters, and certainly was affected by their plight, but DON'T read this book if your prescription for Prozac has run out."
4,Love in struggle,"Barr's first novel is the story of two women trying to make a life together in the late 1800s in Pennsylvania and later in Nevada. It focuses more on the strengthening of Sarah than on the love she and Imogene share, which gives the book more potency than a run-of-the-mill love story. While not an uplifting story per se, this book is thoroughly enjoyable and captivating. I was reminded in some places of ""Frontiers"" by Michael Jensen and of ""Tipping the Velvet"" by Sarah Waters, where the sense of place and time is clear and beautifully woven into a strong story."
4,Bittersweet,"This book is an insightful and sensitive look at the isolation of individuals and the comfort of companionship. A charming alternative to the typical hstorical romance, written with wit and understanding of the relationships of women. I was surprised by its poignancy and honesty."
3,BitterSweet is just that,"While good writing is involved here, a very sad read.It reminds me of how when directors want a lesbian hero in their movies, but then say we have to kill her off though."
4,"Writing is not just an activity, it is a mirror","This fine book sheds light into the process BEHIND the process. It is a useful companion on the desk of every writer, and would-be writer. The meat of this book is that writing takes place from inside out, and from outside in. This may be both its blessing and its curse, as the book does tend to an ""above the neck"" stiffness occasionally. One should not, however, let this deter from its reading and use. Over all, this is a must have book for teachers, students, and writers."
5,another monster guitarist kills the blues,"If you like traditional BLUES or get off on subtle guitar stylings, this is not for you. If,like me, you love no holds barred electric blues that sounds improvisational and off the cuff, than HOOKS is your man. I love the carefree attitude of this CD. This man is fast and doensn't mind showing it. ( a bit like MELVIN TAYLOR or JAY GORDON ). Speed can sometimes be a detriment as it superseeds all other aspects, but not in this case. HOOKS plays with such an obvious understanding of the BLUES and so much emotion that even his speediest passages never sound like finger excercises or scale repetitions.Most of the songs are excellent and he sings with a laconic quality that suits his brand of BLUES very well.Once again if you like the guitar and the BLUES you need this CD"
1,Another SRV clone?,"Just what we need....please, all you SRV slaves, listen to some Rory Gallagher, Kim Simmonds, Roy Buchanan, Peter Green, Albert King, B.B.King, Freddie King, and quit supporting the Tube Screamer/Strat legions. I've had enough."
3,Left me wanting.,"The product falls short of its marketing hype. The User interface is somewhat quirkey. Over all the product is satisfactory for my needs.However, the tech support leaves a lot to be desired. Using the online trouble report screen gets you a sparse response that will require a follow up call to get an answer.The biggest problem I have come accross is the fact that you can only use the program if you are an administrator in OS X. Since all users have access to the program this is a major short-coming and there is no work-around (according to tech support).They do have a toll free phone number but it is not posted on their website. You will get it on the signature line of the technicians email response.Overall a good product that has left me frustrated."
1,Non Working Iris from Amazon,"I read that this was an excellent piece of software. I have been unable to get it to work.Each time I try to open it I get the following message: ""The application Readiris quit unexpectedly""I have not been able to reach tech help by phone. They always put me on hold forever and no onecomes to the phone.Its frustating.A. White"
2,good boot poor sole,The sole on these boot wore slick about a year after puchase. I love danner for the comfort I will get a black sole next time for durability.
1,Runaway,"This was an attractive walker, but not stable for me. It ran fast and it took a good squeeze on the brakes to contain it. I was not secure on it."
3,Good start on changing your life,"This book provides some excellent advice on becoming who you want to be, but I don't think it went far enough in helping readers assess who they are and what goals are realistic for them.Lorraine EnosAuthor of The Portable Coach: A Do-It-Yourself Approach to Personal Coaching"
1,Not very helpful...,"You have to give kudos to Ms. Sher, she really does pull out all the stops on trying to figure out what you want to do with your life. I fit into the last category of her book, those for whom ""nothing interests me"" was said to describe. While she's quite blunt on the causes, she dosen't really give any concrete help on what to do about it. And her suggestion to just remember a time when you DID find things interesting...well, if that helped I wouldn't be reading her book in the first place. What if nothing interested you back then, either? I mean, really? She's very long on the theory and ""pull yourself up by the bootstraps"", but very short on what to do when you haven't the foggiest on what to do. I had very high hopes for this book, and it was very disappointing."
3,It didn't really help...,...but it didn't really hurt either. It was just a reminder of a bunch of stuff I kind of already knew. But nothing life changing.
2,I Could Do Anything If I Only Knew What It Was : How to Disc,"I give it 2 stars because it was an easy read. Other than that, it did not help me at all. I thought it was just more of the same."
2,Blame Your Parents!,"This is another touchy-feely book for people who need to feel that their problems are the results of their parents child-rearing techniques. It's a promotional guide for therapy that gives no practical help that I could tell. However, it does give some interesting anecdotes and insights into human behavior and should help the reader identify just where their parents went wrong."
1,What a waste of time,"I got nothing out of this book. Too much time focused on doing meaningless activities in the book. Too much hogwash about upbringing, etc. as the root of your problem."
5,Helpful and Humorous,"I was fortunate enough to receive this as a gift during my freshman year of college. Didn't know what I wanted to major in at the time let alone what to do with my life. Nine years later, I'm definitely closer to defining the goals in my life and becoming more accepting of myself. This book was invaluable in helping me become the person I am today. Finding yourself and what you want out of life doesn't happen overnight, thank heavens for that.I'm not into books that berate the reader and scream ""just do it you loser"" like some of the more popular books in this genre. If I wanted to be pissed on I could just spend more time with my parents. So if you're into THAT school of self-help then this book is not for you. But if you've got a sense of humor, are patient, realistic, and need some helpful words of encouragement, then it wouldn't hurt to check this out."
5,"Need a change, read this book","14 years ago I was in a rutt and under appreciated at my job then I heard about this book on the radio. A month later I had started my own Pet Care business which I still have to this day.Read it, it Should change your life !!"
5,I've changed careers because of this little book.,I didn't even have to finish reading the book. I couldn't believe these authors had such insight to what I needed to change my life around. I have accomplished so much in changing my career path and I am now making a career for myself that I truly enjoy.
3,"Promising start, but not quite what I was looking for","I found the first four chapters helpful with activities that made me think about what career would be right for me. Unfortunately the following chapters were not really on ""discovering what you really want"", but covered a slew of reasons why people don't go after their heart's desire. I have a great life (minus the fulfilling career) with supportive family and friends whose only expectation is to do whatever makes me happy, so the majority of the book just didn't speak to me. It just seems to focus on the negative reasons you don't pursue a new career rather than counselling the reader in ways of how to go about uncovering the career that is right for him or her. So, good book if you are surrounded by mental roadblocks, not so good if you just really don't know what you want to do."
3,Only moderately helpful,"I read the book and did the determining excercises that were meant to tell me what I want in a career. Sher pegged my character and did an excellent job of listing some factors I should look for in a career field (chiefly, variety and shorter-term projects, with several things to work on at once). However, 'my' section of the book was regrettably short on concrete suggestions for where I might find those factors, or even where to start looking or what questions to ask.It is possible, though, my type is just hard to fit and that other personality types may find more concrete help here."
3,"Interesting, but didn't help.",I am still as lost as when I bought the book. Initially after reading it I did feel a sense of excitement - like I really would be able to figure out what I wanted to do. That faded pretty quickly. It's not a bad book overall. Some of the exercises are interesting and revealing. It's easy to read and well laid out. It just didn't help me.
5,Inspiring!,I checked this book out from the library. I was so inspired and wanted to highlight so many tips and ideas that I decided to buy the book on Amazon. I ended up buying a few for friends and family. I am now looking at B. Sher's other books to find some new favorites to add to my library. This book has helped me uncover some questions in my life and to continue being o.k. with who I am and the way I operate. Thank you Ms. Sher!
2,Boring....,"I could not wait until I finished reading it. I have ready many self-help books and this is among the worst. A lot of the chapters are repetitive. In my opinion, a lot of the exercises are boring. The only part of the book that I did find interesting was on the possible causes of buried desire. I must be different, since it appears that almost everyone else who read this book enjoyed it."
2,Another timewaster,Well this certainly seemed to be not what the title hinted at. It really seemed to be something to actually take one off track. Too bad.
3,Doesn't quite deliver the goods,"This book is helpful to an extent and has some interesting ways of looking at the problem. Like many such books however, it is lacking when it gets down to brass tacks. She has you fantasize about your Dream Job (and she does mean fantasize: your dream job might be rockstar on weekdays, fighter pilot on weekends)and next thing you know she has you trying to make it happen. What's missing is that crucial jump from fantasizing to identifying real, practical jobs that suit you.Also, most of the chapters deal with various types of resistance you may have to finding your perfect job. These can be useful, but again she omits a certain amount of reality and practicality. What if your 'resistance' is not the result of a personality trait, but of practical concerns about earning a living? What if they are not hiring rockstars this week?You can get some insight and inspiration here, but it's not necessarily going to actually deliever what it promises."
5,Read it - it will change your life!!,"I felt as if I was reading about my life when Barbara wrote some of the examples in her book. I've never understood my gifts and abilities. I love the fact that Barbara doesn't try to mess with your mind while dealing with your heart. I've started taking baby steps towards things I've always talked myself out of before, and even things that I didn't know I had any interest in. I've even learned to appreciate my ""boring"" job for what it allows me to do. Well done Barbara for reaching out and touching people - right where they are at!!"
2,"If you're a bundle of neuroses, this is the book for you!","For me, these tapes were not very helpful. I was hoping to find help discovering what I really want to do. Instead I found more about shedding the anger I am supposed to feel about my parents unspoken expectations. The one thing I did learn from these tapes is that I am not afraid to move forward with my life and most of the things Ms. Sher focuses on are simply not issues for me. There is value in that, but what I really need are exercises to help me change my career path. This has led me to another book called ""The Pathfinder"" by Nicholas Lore."
4,I Could Do Anything If I Only Knew What It Is........,I found this book to be an excellent resource for those needing help finding their career path or life's work. Barbara Sher has wisdom to offer all ages and phases of life.
5,life is better,I bought this for my bf who was feeling a little down about life and where he was headed. Within a month of purchasing he had read it and signed up for class at a local technical school. He is 33 years old and says he is happier than ever with the choices he has made. He will graduate in May.
4,Better than I expected,"If you are willing to put the time into the book and actually do the excersises that are involved in the process, the book itself can be an enlightening and rewarding experience."
1,SAME OL SAME,"NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE SPAGHETTI BEING WRITTEN BY ALL THE NEW AUTHORS COMING ABOUT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. SAME THING, DIFFERENT DAY. NICE TRY. BUT I NEED SOME ORIGINAL, NOVEL IDEAS HERE THAT OFFER ME CONCRETE ASSISTANCE. WE DONT NEED ANY MORE BIOGRAPHIES AND TRIVIAL ACCOUNTS OF DAILY EXPERIENCES."
1,"Avoid it, there exists better offers",This trash is self-help at its worst. It makes Dr. Phil and Jerry Springer seem solid and sincere. Yuck. Avoid at all costs (how was I coerced into buying this?)
2,Not particularly useful,Read through the book including all the chapters that I didn't think really related. Makes sense but didn't really help me at all and I am right where I began.
3,Helpful but,I just finished reading this book and I can say It is helpful. The only thing I can say that made me want to put this book down is that the author constantly makes an assumption that the reader is a woman. If you are a man and you read this assumptin that you are in fact a woman you start to get he feeling that this book is not a book for you. If you can get past this flaw like I did I beleive that this book can be helpful. It will not make you get off your butt to get started but It will help you realize that your not the only one out there with these problems of not knowing what to do next.
3,I Could Do Anything,"I have said ""I could do anything if I knew what it was"" more times than I could count over the course of my lifetime. I thought that this book would finally help me figure out the answer, but it only left me thinking, ""I could do anything if I knew what book would give me better direction on that."" While the title of this book tugged at my heart, the author fell short on delivering guidance.If you are a highly reflective person, I'd recommend passing on this book; however, if you are someone who is new to the world of self-discovery, you might find some helpful tidbits to help you discover your next steps in life."
2,Informative but...,"Though she does help me understand some of the things that are holding me back I don't feel like she is telling me what I can do to make things change."" This is why you are experiencing this"" is what she is saying but not enough of ""This is what I suggest you do to change it"".Also, she mentions her failed relationships way too may times and that makes it personally hard for me to continue reading not to mention trust that her advice will change my life for the better."
2,Did not help,"I read the reviews before getting the book. Since there were so many mixed ones, I decided to give it a try and find out for myself if it was worth reading or not. The book is easy to read (hence the 2 stars), but other than that, it does nothing to point what I want to do. It starts with talking about your dream job and desires and how your family is responsible for your confusion. But seriously, if I knew my dream job or desires, I wouldn't read the book.It has a chapter on 'jack of all trades', but it still talks like you are skilled at these various things and you are just afraid to choose. Well, I'm not afraid to choose, but I just don't know what to choose.I'm quite disappointed with the book. It left me exactly where I started."
5,can self help be fun?,"A very helpful book, still thinking about some of the things I read in there! Not a deep dark self help book for sure-which is nice for a change."
3,"self-esteem is nice and all, but...","I haven't yet finished this book, in fact I doubt I will. I was looking for a concrete guide to finding a satisfying career, not a bunch of fluffy platitudes.My question is to the reviewers here: while it's good that reading this book made you feel better about yourself and gave you courage and so forth, the important question is: Are you now in a satisfying career? Did the book do what it claims to do?"
5,A Great Teaching Tool,"The cards are not only beautiful, but are very fine teaching aids. I use them as writing prompts for upper elementary and middle school kids, and they would work for adults as well. I've also used them in teaching English as a Second Language. It is nice to have interesting images to discuss, in any language. And, of course, they are excellent for art classes -- for discussions of line, shape, foreground, background, movement, focal point, etc. Oh, one more thing I use them for. My kids pick one a night, and we make up stories about what we see, or imagine we see, in the card -- where it might be, what the people might be doing, or some such flight of imagination. In short, this excellent set is a very versatile communication tool."
2,Huh?,"The photographs are reduced to such a small size that you need a magnifying glass to look at them. And then, there are about 5 interesting photographs and the others are just boring. It is as if they gave a bunch of disposable cameras to kindergarteners. I don't get what is cool about the back of a head partially blocking the view of a windmill; maybe you will."
1,No relevance to the reality,Basically whatever is being said is to just put a wrong picture of Bohra Community in the world eyes. I wouldn't even recommend anyone to take a look at it. WAIST OF TIME
1,Warning!,"An excellent movie (as I remember it from years ago) but this is just a warning concerning the DVD. Although the web page indicates that it has closed captions, in fact it does not. There is no closed caption, nor does the DVD have subtitles."
4,Pretty Interesting Series,This is an interesting series about a not too often discussed part of the Battle for Britain... would like to see it come to DVD.
4,Must Have Text,"This is a must have book for those who actually care to learn about implant dentistry from one of the leading figures in the field. Each chapter is well written and complete. You can access each chapter if you seek out specific information, or you can read the entire text front cover to last page.Highly recommend this book."
5,Too big a book.,Big book. I know its a good book. I need time to read it. I love the book. Recommend to all.
4,Contemporary Implant Dentistry,"This has been a great reference for treatment planning, surgical considerations and pre-placement grafting. I have used it primarily as a reference, since reading cover to cover never happens in my hands. I am very happy with the purchase."
3,Pretty good but not the best,"I saw this movie at the Imax Theater at the Wright Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio. It is a must for any aviation enthusiast. I would rate it a B+.The movie keeps repeating information and the landing sequences are all the same. It gets a bit boring in the latter part of the movie. To me, it seemed a little disjointed in the end. They show some high tech 3D animation but do not follow it up. I felt that a lot of video footage of the planes landing were the same.The makers of this movie need to take some pointers from the makers of ""Magic of Flight"". The ""Magic of Flight"" guys kept it interesting all through the duration of the DVD.To sum it up, I would watch it but it will not be on my list of favorites."
5,Best Air Force Flick I've seen,Terrific & realistic. Lots of action. Those guys are more fearless than NASCAR drivers!
5,Great Fighter Pilot Video,"I have watched this video many times. I first saw it on the IMAX screen at the Luxor in Las Vegas. Wow, what a movie. I subsequently bought several copies of the DVD and have given them away as gifts. If you are thrilled by high performance military jets, buy this DVD. Better yet, go to an IMAX theater."
3,oke,great quality great fligth scene but I lttle to military propaganda for me.Anyway overal its was good it gives a good example of what it is to fly a jet figther.
2,Not impressed.,"I purchased this for the WMVHD content. While the detail on my home theater was great, it gave away so much of how this film was pretty much faked.Many shots appear to have included computer animated planes and portions of planes to make it look like a camera was mounted on the plane. Essentially what was going on was a camera mounted on some type of flying object, then the overlay was placed over the footage. I can safely say this because I was professionally trained as a computer animator. Also, many of the explosions on the ground seemed to be faked. As the other person above stated, it's pretty much a flare dropping festival.I was bored....I would spend your money on a different film, as I would rather watch Iron Eagle from the 80s than this.I have a feeling that used copy of this movie is going to go on an auction site soon."
2,Good for kids,"I thought this was an average video. There were a lot of inconsistencies and poor CGI graphics. There was some cool in-flight footage but not much. LOL really bad acting but I guess they did their best to try and present an experience. Honestly, I wish I didn't buy it, but I guess it's worth watching once."
3,"Okay, but not too realistic","I saw this movie at teh US- Air force Museum IMAX in DAyton,OH. My father is a fighter pilot and i am pretty much sure imgoing to after i finish high school. This movie is very exciting but not very realistic. For one thing, their are A-10s always dropping flares. *Scratch Head*. But to anyone but the true afficianado, this movie gives the feel of an air force red flag exercise."
3,Hollywood Gimmickry,"I saw Fighter Pilot: Operation Red Flag on the USS Lexington museum in Corpus Christi, TX. At first I thought it was one on the most beautiful films ever made. But, I noticed some Hollywood gimmickry was afoot. In the dogfight scene, the pursuing F-16 didn't look right. Real dogfights are probably not that interesting in that computer guided missiles are fired many miles away so the aircraft never get that close. Also, in the live fire sequences, the bombs could not be seen and the explosions were too fiery. Wouldn't the target tank (as well as the camera) be destroyed?Still, Fighter Pilot is an interesting film best seen at an IMAX theater with loud sound.[DW]"
1,"Could be great in HD, but can't view it","Windows errors on me saying that it can't acquire a content license on my home machine. I can play it on my laptop, but not on the machine attached to my big screen so it's useless.They either need to give instructions on how to fix the problem, or stop using the horrid protection scheme."
2,Too fake for IMAX.,"I am very surprised IMAX made this since I thought they were good at showing the real thing, but I must have been wrong. Some of the scenes, like the A-10s ""bombing"" the tanks, are fake. I guess it was for safety, but come on, this should be a real movie, not some crazy Hollywood action. I would much rather have seen real strafing and bombing runs from a distance then fake explosions from close. Other things, such as the AWACS scene, look fake too. I have been in the E-3 sentry and know the screens they showed are completely fake. The real plane doesn't look like that at all. There are also some scenes were cockpits somehow instantly change variants. Like in a few scenes, the views kept changing from an F-15C to an F-15E. There are several more issues I found that makes the video look very fake. These might not matter to someone who wants to see an action movie, but for an IMAX movie, they are unacceptable."
4,Review of Fighter Pilot DVD,"A fantastic video. However, having seen it on a friends blue ray player (this is why I ordered it) it tends to lose some impact on a standard DVD. I did encounter one major problem though. Because it is in NTSC format, I keep getting the message at start up that I have an incompatible TV system and the disk will not play. I have to eject and re-insert several times before my PAL setup will accept the video. Consequently I have again ordered the DVD in PAL format from an Australian supplier."
4,A great movie for HD and 5.1,I saw the movie on television and was intrigued enough to order a DVD. It is a great documentary action film that puts you in the pilot seat. Great video and sounds great.
5,tennesseecurt,"Excellent video, if you love the air and our military you will love this video. Thank you for explaining how great our military is."
5,A Sensually Southern Romance,"I've read all the books in Rosalyn West's Men of Pride County series, and this one has to be my favorite. Starla Fairfax's survival through all the tragedies heaped on her is awe inspiring. Hamilton Dodge's fierce independence and strength of character is able to defeat his crippledness and prove himself as a man who can win the trust of any woman's heart. I loved the twists and turns Rosalyn West weaves throughout the plot of her story. The story is not only believable, but thouroghly enjoyable. I was unable to put the book down until I had discovered the dark secrets that guide Starla Fairfax's life. This is truly a great romance.It was even more enjoyable than the other novels in this series, if you can believe that's possible."
5,"Brilliant Acting, Brutal and Dark Movie, Incredible Ending","Jon Voight gives a Tour de Force performance in this dark, brutal, but uplifting action/drama. The cinematography is terrific and the train action is very realistic, considering that this movie was made over 15 years ago.The character's struggle for freedom and coming to terms with impending disaster on a train is handled well by a great script and brilliant acting. Both Voight and Roberts were nominated for Oscars for their prospective roles.The ending is one of the most overwelming and beautiful finishes you will ever see in any movie. It will definately make you think!Highly recommended!"
1,Seller offered clean totally viewable copy.,I viewed the movie and at the end the movie screen froze indicating a scratch. No amount of buffing would take it out. A bit disappointed as it ARRIVED in time for Valentine's Day but was not in GOOD viewing condition.
3,SHORT TRAIN RUNNIN,"Set in the northernmost wilderness of Alaska, RUNAWAY TRAIN was a surprise hit back in 1985, garnering Oscar nominations for stars Jon Voight and Eric Roberts.Voight plays the grizzly safecracker who escapes from a maximum security prison with his adoring fan, rapist Eric Roberts. Their escape leads them to hop on a train, not knowing that the engineer has dropped dead and fallen off the train and that they are hurtling across the wasteland at high speeds with no engineer! Nor do they know that Rebecca DeMornay is also on the train, the engineer's assistant who had taken an untimely nap and has awakened to her dangerous situation.The cast is good: Voight and Roberts chew up the scenery, DeMornay is effective and supporting John P. Ryan oozes evil as the sadistic warden. It's rather dated but the scenery is haunting and beautiful and has enough action to maintain interest."
5,Substitute for air conditioning.,"It'll cool the room by ten degrees. (Unless of course your mind works contrariwise in which it will heat it up by the same)I loved it at the time, when I saw it twice, owned it on videotape, gotten it for friends (they thought it was weird) am now getting the DVD. I'll be interested in seeing it after saturating myself with Kurosawa for a while (I think the original story came from him)."
2,Disappointed!!!!,"None of my dvd players would play this dvd. When I finally found out it was for a region other than the one I live in (who is supposed to know THAT?) it was too late for me to return. When you order a dvd, ALWAYSmake sure its for region 1--IF you live in the US and if you have a US made player! I saw this movie years ago and enjoyed it but because I can't even view--or return--the one I received I can't give it more than a couple of stars! I think Amazonshould warn people in the US to make sure they are ordering a DVD for the proper region? What I don't understand is why the seller didn't realize that because I live in CALIFORNIA and all DVDS for American players are for Region 1!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Don't believe the hype,"Way overhyped, with less than stellar casting. This is not a great film, or a great artistic statement."
1,Waste of money,Did anyone yell cut once in this film? All the acting is overdone and seems to be one continuous rant about anything and everything. My copy is now in the trash. You want a great movie about trains get The Train with Burt Lancaster....
4,In the realm of Shawshenk and Green Mile,"Though the language is expectedly abrupt (for a prison flick), the acting and directing are exceptional. The plot holds well and should leave the viewer deeply pensive to Kurosawa's motives of who/what is good or evil in our journeys in life."
1,Geographic problem,Received DVD but it was not designed for US players. Air message stated wrong geographic area for play.Replacement DVD had the same problem. Assumption is any further replacement would be the same problem.
1,UNHAPPY!!!!,"I was stupid did no read the fine print,I purchased a dvd that will not play on players made in the U.S. When I asked for a refund it was denied! I sell on Amazon and I do returns all the time. I even offered to send a list of other moveis I am looking for and (I RECIVED A VERY RUDE RESPONCE BACK!) I will never purchase from you again and have sent a copy for your responce to 323 friends and they will do the same!! Good luck!!"
3,older movie but good,good wholesome older moving for young kids that like animals. 3year old granddaughter asked to watch it more than once
3,Great for Benji lovers!,"I have never seen any of the Benji movies before and I thought it was okay, but I think Benji lovers will definitely like this movie! It has some sad parts in it which wrenched at my heart and I think that's why I personally didn't like it, I do like the fact there's very little dialogue though."
4,"I liked this movie, but I wish they'd used Paul, Cindy, George and Nancy instead of the old fisherman","I liked this movie, but I wish they'd used Paul, Cindy, George and Nancy instead of the old fisherman as his owners. It would have made a large improvement to the movie"
2,boring!!,Benji runs and then runs some more- back and forth. Very Boring but the kids loved it. I remember Benji in the city being a little more exciting as a kid.
1,The absolute WORST Disney film ever!,"""Benji the Hunted"" is supposedly the last Benji film made so far, and I hope that is the case. This film is extraordinarily DULL and BORING! The opening sequence is the only thing that I actually liked. After that, it's all downhill from there. The viewer has to suffer through 90 minutes of Benji the dog and his animal friends mating and playing in the woods, complete with some terrible '80s synthesizer music and repetitive nature scenes. Almost no dialogue or action occurs during the film. There are only three major human actors in it, and they are on-screen for about 5 to 10 minutes. Man, is this movie deadly! No wonder it got ignored by the public, and shame on Disney for releasing such a flat-out boring movie like this back in the late '80s. This movie is also an insult to the original ""Benji"" from 1974, which I really liked as a child and probably still do."
4,Entertaining Film for the Whole Family.,"When a Dog named Benji gets lost in the Widerness of the Pacific Northwest, while his Master os trying to find his Dog. Benji founds Baby Cougars, which Benji is protecting them from a Wolf is Haunting Them.Directed by Joe Camp, who made another Benji Films, this one is the Most Entertaining and the Best and also Last Film of Benji. Kids and Adults wil, enjoy this adventure film, for the whole family. Produced by Walt Disney Pictures. This is a fun enjoyable movie. Grade:B+."
4,E.P. MINI TAKEOFF ALBUM,"This is the original sound of the fantastic Presets, The vocals are not as raw but of the opposite, Very electric and hard hitting...You`ll notice that punk-dance feel to it. I have all the albums...Just hear `Pretty little eyes`, You`ll get the darker vibe of the Aussie born band."
1,disappointed,"When I found out Abena Abri-Let Booster Pads, Maxi, had been discontinued I contacted the vendor for a similar product. It was suggested I purchase the TopLine Booster Pad. In no way do these two items compare! Will continue to look and if anyone has an option please advise. Thanks!"
5,Great product,"my 9 month old was constantly leaking through her diapers after sleeping all night. Even the night time diapers weren't cutting it. I ordered these and since putting one in her diaper before bed, we have no more leakage! These pads are great!"
2,May Prevent Diaper From Doing Its Job,"I only used the booster once with my 92 year old mom. She had leakage with her new Abena pull-ons during the night, and it looked like the barrier on the other side of the booster, prevented the diaper from absorbing the urine, and the booster ""overflowed"". I guess the booster would be better for a younger, more mobile person, who could carry a couple of boosters, instead of diapers, change them, and still keep the diaper fresh."
3,Tiny,Unfortunately these particular pads are designed as inserts for panties. They are not the same as ordered before which were appropriate for overnight use. Nowhere in the description does it indicate that the pads are tiny.
4,Acrobat 7.0 Professional,Perfect for creating memory efficient copies of important home documents for organizing and managing home records. Only shortcoming is the price is higher than I think it ought to be.
5,Adobe Acrobat Professional soft ware,The program is all I expected it to be and more - it makes working in the file very easy and I can email the entire file to anyone. Great program!!!
1,Disgusting software,Some questions always puzzle me:1. How studpid a company needs to be to waste the time and money of their customers?2. Do they know those buttons they've created are useless and annoying? Do they have feelings?3. We just need a damn reader. Why do they make this huge monster?4. $300?
1,IT BEHAVES LIKE A POOR BETA RELEASE,"I bought the upgrade to Acrobat Professional 7+ to replace my 6.0 Professional. All I got was ""program not responding"" messages when I tried to execute simple functions like scanning documents or opening documents to read, edit. I spend some time with an Adobe technician (nice people) who helped trouble shoot the installation. This required that I (on my own) start closing open programs one by one and rebooting. Finally Acrobat Prof. 7.+ worked....for a while. A installed a simple program, Tunebite's upgrade. Adobe 7+ Professional started freezing again. I gave up and uninstalled it and reinstalled crobat 6.0 professional, which is working fine as it always did. I don't have hours and patience to work Acrobat's Professional 7+ bugs.I can't send the software back, so I will take my losses and wait for another update or for version 8, hoping that this one will work. If you have any comments you may contact me at:[...]"
1,Don't buy Version 7!,"I paid full retail price for Acrobat 7.0 based on my assumtion about Adobe's reputation. What a huge mistake! Acrobat 7 will take over your machine and spread its tentacles into nearly all of your applications. The arrogance of Adobe is truly amazing. I couldn't make it work with Netscape, but I also couldn't remove it and use Reader 6.0 either. It seems they know best how you want to use your computer, and they enforce their methods upon you. Good luck if you have any problems or questions: the technical support people wanted $40.00 to answer a simple question, and this was immediately after I purchased and registered the product. I finally had to uninstall Acrobat completely from my machine. I've just wasted $450.00.Steer clear of Version 7!"
1,Designed to steal your money,"I agree with all the negative comments made by other reviewers. I am surprised that the product got only 14 one star reviews so far. Here is another problem so far not mentioned by other reviewers. The product contains a nag screen that tells you your computers configuration has changed, even if it has not changed. It then prompts you to reactivate. You can reactivate 3 times. Once the 3 time are up, you have to call customer service. That is where the real nightmare starts. Endless holding, nasty customer service reps that treat you like you are trying to rip off there worthless software. If you can possibly avoid Adobe products alltogether, you will be much better off."
4,Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Professional,"Product was shipped in accordance with promised ship date; received in condition as advertised. Although there was an initial problem with installation, prompt response from Seller Customer Service resolved the issue. I am very pleased with the purchase."
1,What a disappointment,"I actually didn't purchase this product, but my company did and I am getting the PDF Error 20225 no matter what we do. I have followed all of the steps to eradicate this error from the Adobe website to no avail. Now all I'm stuck with is a high-priced reader. I wanted this product so that I could make end-user documentation using graphics. The demo product worked great but this version stinks to high heaven. I will be posting this on the Adobe website as well. They desperately need to get a fix for this and not 16 steps that don't work."
3,Adobe Acrobat and MS Office Integration Nightmare,"I agree with the majority of reviewers regarding this product's overly intrusive grip on MS Office applications. It is just horrible.Unfortunately, renaming the PDFMaker subdirectory doesn't work if you are using the MS Office Suite of applications, because Adobe Acrobat is self-reparing. Next time you try to exercise anything related to Adobe Acrobat while using an MS Office app, Adobe Acrobat will self-repair itself by re-creating the PDFMaker directory!The only way to totally disable AdobeAcrobat integration with the MS Office products is to hack into the Windows registry and delete its hooks that it uses to register itself into the MS Office suite of installed applications. It's dangerous to do that, and I don't want to risk damaging my work PC. To do it safely, just keep messing with the preferences/options in the MS Office apps, until you manage to tame the acrobatic beast."
5,We need more than highlights,"This is a fabulous recording of Aida. Nilsson is wonderful, Bumbry is passionate, but Corelli steals the show. He is the definition of heroic. There is a full version of this out there. It is put out by Black Dog Opera Library. Do a search and check it out."
4,"For Digital Editing, this book is ideal for beginners","This book is not about about how to take better digital photos. It's a book that gives step by step instructions on how to do numerous photo editing. If you're not experienced in PhotoShop, then I highly recommend this book. For a novice, it might be a good refresher for you.One of the things I love about this book is it actually does give step-by-step visuals on the how tos. It shows you what the photoshop box will look like, tells you were to find the tools you need, etc.If that's what you're looking for, then this book is ideal for you. As I said, if you're a novice, it's a nice refresher or quick reference book."
4,"Great Book, Very Helpful","This book is easy to follow ans teaches the ""everyday""/""average"" photographer new techniques and styles of capturing beautiful pictures. The book is filled with full-color illustrations and example photographs. The tools and techniques described can be used for nearly every digital camera - from the most basic, to those that are more advanced."
5,James McAvoy sizzles,"The film adaptation of the book is lacking in that special ""uumph"" which makes for a dynamic movie, but James McAvoy does everything in his power to save it. Tom Hanks is one of the producers so it has some merit. If one wants a good romantic comedy, this one has real potential. McAvoy begins his college career with idealized ideas of what the college experience is supposed to include. When he ""screws"" up big time, he must learn what really counts in this world and what real love says to a person."
2,Off the Mark,"If you are interested in Mr. O'Connor's normally fabulous music (i.e. the 30 year retrospective album, Midnight on the Water, In Full Swing), you will likely gag at this album. Don't get me wrong, O'Connor has no contemporary comparison when it comes to talent and catchy Tunes. But this album is snlow and full of synthesizers and reverb, like a weird techno-trip back to the eighties. It's the music you might hear in a soundtrack of a corny after school special. The good stuff is buried too deep to find here."
3,ITs ok.,"I bought this for my son, but theres really not much thats really great about this. the stickers are fun, and so is the little posters. the coloring books arent much, and only two crayons, blue and pink."
1,Ugh!,"I was looking for music for an island theme party. The selection looked fun -- a lot of recognizable summer party songs with the steel drum flair. But then I bought it and actually listened to it. The steel drum parts are really good; however, the synthesized accompaniment is over powering and really cheesy (it sounds like it should be on Barney). Please, save your money and look elsewhere."
4,"Aura, a good book","""Aura"" de Carlos FuentesAura, un libro buenoAura es un perfecto introduction a la latinoamericana y el genre realismo magico. En esta novella, Aura es una chica joven con ojos verdes misteriosos. Senora Consuelo es la tia de Aura, y nos viven. El narador, Felipe Monterro, es un hombre joven y trabajadora la periodista. Un dia, Filepe es ofreco, trabajando Senora Consuelo. Hay mas cosas que representa un elemento magical despues de el empiecen trabajar. La casa en la cuenta es muy bonita, y perfecto. Senora Consuelo viven en la casa con Aura. La casa es muy misteriosa y represnte un elemento magical. Felipe le gusta Aura, pero Filipe no sabe que la relacion de Aura y Senora Consuelo. Esto es un novela excelente que recomendaria tu mis amigas. Pienso que este libro representaba la clase de alta y bajo, y esta un problema social. Aura de Carlos Fuentes es un libro mejor que lee en mis classes de espanol. Lo recomiendo los personas que le gustan aventura, magico, pasiones y suspensos."
3,A quick read,A friend of mine loaned me this book and advised me that this was required reading in Mexico. I decided to give it a read and approached it as though I were a 17 year old reading this for a school assignment instead of a reading for enjoyment.The narrative is in the first party and very easy to read. The author in my opinion spends a little too much time in his descriptions as though he had a word minimum he had to hit for his publisher. The plot was no surprise and I had it figured out half way thru yet once again the story was easy to read so I enjoyed continuing with the story.As far as the story goes I felt it had a few holes in it but it can be best descriped as a supernatural story with a focus on a love story.For required reading it did not compare to Hemmingway or Fitzgerald but it was more on par with an edgar allen poe storey.
3,This book was okay.,"Aura is a story which can sometimes be confusing, and which has no basic purpose. In the story, Felipe Montero is searching for a job and finds one reading and correcting memoirs for Senora Consuelo. As the story progresses, Felipe discovers Aura, the niece of Senora Consuelo, and sleeps with her, only to later sleep with Senora Consuelo thinking her to be Aura. This is where the story ends, leaving the ending hanging and the readers with a feeling that the story is not complete. This book, though short, can be very confusing at times, does not seem to have any closure, and the fact that it does not seem to have a basic purpose makes this a novel that is not for everybody."
2,"For the translation, not the Novel itself","A key element in Fuentes' novel is the manner in which it's written: second person all throughout, mixing future and past sense, and thusly creating the imagery he wishes to portray. The novel (for its literary merit) is great; any one who appreciates literature (versus entertainment) will enjoy it. However, I want to make a note that the English translation is not the best.This version is ideal for those who know Spanish, but whose vocabulary will fail them sporadically--allowing for a quick glance at the translation. If, however, you wish to read only its English version, look elsewhere. The translator misses the literary focus of the author, who employs short phrases, interweaving past and present tenses. Given that the importance of this novel is due to its literary features--which together with plot create the message the author wants to make--much is lost with this translation that does not do justice to the original."
4,Fascinating novella with a twist,"A young historian responds to a newspaper ad to organize the personal papers of a deceased general for his elderly widow. He almost declines but is swayed by the elderly woman's niece, who is a vision of beauty. He gets increasingly involved in the household...until he is perhaps too involved.This novella is unusually in the second-person: you, the reader, are the main character. It was hard to shake off the unusualness of that perspective (I mostly associate it with Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books) but still, it probably helped draw me deeper into the narrative. And since the book examines issues of identify, blurring the lines between one character and another, Fuentes' blurring of the line between the reader and the protagonist seems appropriate.The story is engaging, disturbing, and exciting; and it is short: readable in an hour or so. (It took me a bit longer a leerlo en español pero no mucho.)"
3,Review of Billingual Aura,"The translation is clear, but this volume really calls for an academic introduction: some sort of biographical or thematic essay on the work itself. I was disappointed to find that this edition has neither. Again, beyond this, the translation is clear and the writing is certainly large enough to read."
5,Aura,"Aura es una novela para Carlos Fuentes. Es una novela con amor y mágico. Es sobre un hombre, Felipe Montero, quien es trabajando para una mujer viejo, Consuelo y su sobrina, Aura. Felipe se enamora con Aura. Con su ama hay mucho misterio. En el final del cuento Felipe encontró un foto... No quiero decir el fin del cuento. Pero haces creer en amor, destino, mágico, y muerte. Pienso que despues de usted leer este cuento crees. Me gusta mucho este novela porque es un misterio. Es un fin que yo nunca creí. Es una novela breve y todas pueden leer. Este libro es muy bueno. Pienso que este libro es mi favorito libro que leí todo el semestre."
1,Absolute sh*t,"I've heard so many people tout Glenn Branca as the single most important artist in the past 2 decades. That's a pretty loft claim to live up to. Laughably, he falls ENTIRELY short. This is amassed, dissonant (""out-of-tune"" would be the more appropriate phrase here), amusical GARBAGE. What Branca has composed here is utter crap, and the crappiness of the music itself is only augmented by the musicians involved with performing it, in particular, Stephan Wiscerth's awful drumming. I understand that Thurston Moore, Lee Renaldo, Michael Gira, and (less importantly) Page Hamilton have all played with him, but do not let that fool you -- Branca's music is completely unredeeming, humorless, and pretentious to the point of ridiculousness. Don't be fooled!"
5,Just Buy Them,"Absolutely the best cold-weather socks. I invest in a new pair every year and now own about a dozen pairs of this sock. I work in an office building where everyone complains about the over-potent air conditioning and most people wear a coat at their desk. Now I wear my Smartwools to work and I'm comfortable again; I was amazed at the difference they make. Dry feet. No itch. Worth every penny! Oh, and they're great for outdoor activities too."
5,Great sock. Not the heaviest you can get,"If you are looking for really heavy socks, look at the extra heavy smart wool. However, these are actually better if you are going to be very active (hiking) rather than skiing (which I would get the extra heavy sock). Extra heavy is about $5 more expensive, but with cold feet, if you are wearing around the house the extra heavy last longer (both will wear out in the sole of the sock, but it generally takes a few years of frequent heavy wear which is vastly superior to any other brand I have found). Strongly recommend."
4,This isn't in my normal span of music...but....,"Yes, Latin Pop! See how eclectic I've become?I have to say, she has a great voice, and the songs on this album are really good. Some of them are in English, granted I can't understand most of them, but I go for the music more of the time, rather than singing along ability.The first song ""Plastico"" is great. I love it! Has a great chorus and doubled with a great voice...makes for a great song! Granted I can't understand what they're saying, but oh well.What else...I don't know what else to say, but if you're not averse to Latin Pop, and want something new, check her out."
5,JD Natasha!,"This gril is a very creative writer. She has a very beautiful voice at the age of 16. I personally think she is a really great singer even though I can't understand all of her songs. I'm a teenager so I really relate to all her songs. This girl from Miami is very talented. I hope anyone that listens to her music will go out and buy her CD. I think all her songs are ausome!! Realy great Latin music/rock music!! I can't wait to go and get her CD. Her music video ""Lagrimas"" is so good!! I could listen to it all day!! Please buy her CD!! JD Natasha>~Jessica"
