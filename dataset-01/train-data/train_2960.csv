4,The Ginsu knife of telephonic devices.,"Does everything. Fax, answering machine, basic copy abilities (isn't that nice), programs numbers, and to wrap it all up and make it better than all other competitors it actually has a cordless handset. Word of advice, don't forget to get the ink cartridge refill because I have a feeling it runs out fairly quickly. And the biggest problem with this machine is the tome of complicated instructions. Yes, you can figure them out, but there are definitely frustrations involved, as in you'll always find the answering machine function pages when you're looking for the copy function pages. And there are a few too many answering machine functions that are not explained. (You can have a 'tel/fax' function or a 'tad/fax' function, but please don't ask me why or what they are, and you have to set your message to the appropriate function.) But a little patience, and the benefits are worth it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I experienced the same design flaw as Greg K mentioned. This machine was used for home office and received little use, none the less, it was never able to send more than 2-3 sheets at a time, and I always spent valuable time 'feeding' in the pages. Wish I'd given the money away to charity, now must spend again to replace this dud."
1,Plastic Cover Latch Breaks,"I purchased this fax because I had confidence in Panasonic products. The unit was guaranteed for 6 mos. One week after it was out of warranty, the molded plastic latch that holds the cover of the unit down broke off from the body of the unit due to continuous fibration stresses, and the machine would not work thereafter. This is a manufacturing defect in this product. Panasonic refused to replace the unit."
1,Poor Design,"You cannot listen to messages and use the receiver at the same time. Picking up the reciever automatically disconnects anything the machine is doing. If the reciever is off the hook and runs out of juice, then the whole system (including the answering machine) will not work. The handset is also ill-designed as you cannot lean on it like a regular phone lest you immediately disconnect whomever you are speaking with. When sending faxes, machine sometimes grabs more than 1 page you are tying to send. Look carefully to ensure all pages were sent. Only 8 minute tape. I don't recommend."
1,Buy something else,"After 8 months of use, the latch that secures the top down broke. Now If I receieve a fax I have to hold down the top and push manually. The recordings also do not come in clear and when I am on the cordless the buttons are so sensitive that my cheek hits the flash and hangs up on the caller. I manually feed the paper to send fax as well. Can't send multiple pages and film doesnt reproduce well on paper. Very aggrevating product."
5,A different time and place,"What I found most compelling about this work were those women who found the courage to look back at such traumatic times, and to share thier experiences. I can no longer think of the catagory of ""former nuns"" because each individual had her own unique reasons for being there, and experienced individual joys and sorrows. This book is a fine collection of their stories and a chance for the rest of us to experience a different time and place."
2,A good beginning,"I was really interested to learn that there was a DVD about how some of the crazy state shapes came about, but I was a bit disappointed when I watched it. I was hoping for a little more in-depth. I guess there was a series or mini-series on TV (there is a ""Season 1"" available on DVD) and this must have been an introduction or an overview. I was hoping to give it to my father as a gift but his eyesight is failing and it has too much text on the screen at times and moves too fast for him to read it."
2,"Love the Show, but the DVD is disappointing","I love the series since the first time I watched on the History Channel, but the DVD has no indication of any kind if its the whole series or the first couple episodes etc... I believe that the DVD needs more information like 5 of the 10 episodes, or season 1 or volume 1. Anything to let me know what I am getting and what I can get later on"
2,Could be improved,"While I have always been a history buff, I found this production could be much better if the product did not have music playing loudly while someone was speaking. I have no idea why the production staff would think that music inhances everything especially when someone is speaking as it was not needed and made it difficult to understand what was being said. Leave off the drummer and the music and it would be an interesting and informative piece of work. But for me, I would pass if I knew then what I know now regarding the drums and the music."
3,Its a great DVD But...,When you look at this product on Amazon the first image you see is the one that says season one! Yes the other image is there but this product is extremely misleading in terms of what it really is. This is as others have mentioned the 2 hour special. It is a great resource for me to use in my classroom but I really was looking forward to actually being able to use the T.V. Series.
3,diamond in the rough,"To those who wrote harsh reviews of On The Sunday of Life, you have to understand first that this is Steven Wilson's earliest and very experimental work, and is a compilation of what he did which is why it sounds so diverse. It's Steven Wilson the mad scientist, and was probably never really meant to be released, but the material is actually pretty good all things considering he was a ONE-MAN band in the very beginning. Some of the material contains the raw sound of what Porcupine Tree would eventually become, such as Radioactive Toy. There is also a little humor injected such as the odd Message from a Self-Destructing Turnip and Linton Samuel Dawson, and trippy songs like Jupiter Island. Listen to the album for what it is, which is the beginnings of what would be a terrific group."
2,Confusing and overrated,"As a recent convert to Porcupine Tree, over the last six months, having started with the excellent Stupid Dream I have gradually added to my collection which now incorporates the (also) excellent Signify, Lightbulb Sun, Coma Divine and Recordings. I have to say though this is the first real dissappointment and really for dedicated fans only. The mix of musical styles makes the entire album very difficult to listen to and masks the one or two excellent moments. In some ways it reminds me a lot of Hawkwind but that's probably just the old hippy in me! For those seeking their first taste of Porcupine Tree I would suggest this is not the best starting point but can thoroughly recommend investing in some of their other, dare I say, more commercial offerings."
1,stay clear of this one,"to the guy who wrote the last review--- are we listening the the same cd? im a huge porcupine tree fan..stumbled across this one (i was unawre it even existed) and must say i havent been so let down and disappointed in a long time...it was OBVIOUSLY recorded on an analouge 4 track probably in his bedroom... sound gets 1 star, .... the annoying drum machine gets tired by the 3rd song.... couldt even finish listening to it......although some of the passages are nice and atmospheric/beautiful at times---but its definitly not enough to make the recording worthwhile or interesting....my suggestion..... stay away from this one..... purchase ""the sky moves sideways...."" for a true porcupine tree experience....I COULDNT HAVE BEEN MORE DISAPPOINTED..... i could trade for an Ann Murry greatest hits cd........ think i just might ! :)"
2,Ruined after one use!,"I received this crock pot as a wedding gift several months ago. Last week, my husband decided to use it to make chili. We washed the porcelain crock in the dishwasher (which the manufacturer says is ok) before use. It cooked the chili fine; no problems with it being too hot or anything. Afterwards, we washed the crock in the dishwasher again. After it came out, we noticed that the enamel on the inside of the crock pot has already started to wear off. I'm currently trying to get a replacement from Rival but this shouldn't happen after only one use!! Very disappointed in what I thought was a trustworthy brand..."
3,Watch your cook time...,"Pros: nice look to it, easy to clean, low, high, and keep warm settings are nice to have, as well as being able to set the cook time by the half hour.Cons: High is usually way too much. It took me a while to figure out the best way to use this crock. I end up having to cut the ""high"" cook time recommended by slow cook recipes to 1/2 time high, and the rest on low. That works about 80% of the time, depending in the recipe."
1,Beware -- Overcooks Everything,"There are two temp settings for this model hot and very hot. Cooked recipes given in booklet with Rival's cooking times. Two on high - the meat was overcooked and dry. The third on low, I manged to stop early before turned into complete mush. On both settings it was boiling for hours by the end. I would never be able to cook with it unattended. DO NOT BUY. I am searching now for another company's slow cooker. Cannot trust the Rival company that would sell such a blatently defective product."
1,Do Not Buy this Crock Pot!,"I purchased this crock pot with the intention of starting it when left work and having dinner ready when I walked in the door. The one and only recipe I tried said to cook on low for 8-10 hours. The book will advise you that when given a range of time, use the middle. I set the cooker for 8 1/2 hours thinking if it wasn't done when I got home I could still wait a little longer. When I got home my dinner was completely burnt! I also noticed that approximately 5 minutes after I turned it on the outter ""stainless steal"" part of the crock pot was hot to the touch and that just won't work with a three year old in the house. I will be returning it after I can get the burned chicken and rice out of the pot."
1,Crock pot is crap,"I just got married and registered for this crockpot and it burns everything. I felt like it was all my fault, but it is totally the crockpot!"
4,Cleveland Brown gift,the glasses were a good gift and I hear are being worn all the time. A very good fit and very comfortable.
5,great,"Seller shipped very fast, came less than 3 days after ordering (NJ->CA), and was very nicely wrapped. Chocolate is delicious as always, but this was purchased as a gift, so the speed and appearance was very appreciate."
5,Finding Your Purpose at Work,"Working in the field of Personal Development as I do, it rare to come across such a truly inspiring book. Nick Williams combines inspiring writing with practical exercises that I found life affirming.The book helps individuals uncover how they can make a difference and ovecome the fear and barriers that stop us putting this into practice.For anybody struggling to break free from the chains of their current work read this book. It can change your life."
4,Finding Inspiration,"Nick Williams's work has stood the test of time. It still makes the reader think and answer awkward questions. It proffers a way forward towards finding and landing a job where the heart lies. And it draws with relevance on the example of Williams himself, who, now ten years on, is still motivating people to become ""inspired entrepreneurs"".Vaughan Evans, business and career strategistAuthor, BACKING U! A Business-Oriented Approach to Backing Your Passion and Achieving Career Success"
1,For Kids Only,"I should have picked up on this from the reviews, and the award from Kids First, but I didn't. My low rating is for adults, or even older kids. Other reviewers liked it, so it might be fine for kids 8 or 9 and under, but the card tricks are really lame for anyone else. Be advised that this DVD is FOR KIDS ONLY."
2,Redundant information,"I bought this DVD after ""Magic with everyday objetcs"" by the same author. That one was very good for beginners, but this card magic DVD is not good at all. Instead of explaining different ""card forces"", key cards and tricks, Magic Frank explains a couple of forces and then repeat them throughout the DVD. For instance, Card in Pocket, Outside Box, Card in Wallet, Card in Box, Card in Shoe, The Future is Back... are all THE SAME TRICK, but he just changes the place where the guessed card will be (shoe, box, envelope...). It is absurd and a waste of time. He could say it out loud (""you can put the card in a box, shoe or wherever you want"") instead of repeating the WHOLE trick over and over again. Sometimes I thought my DVD player was rewinding all the time."
5,I (still) love these DVDs,"I have MagicFrank's other instructional titles on VHS, but I hope everyone will buy them on DVD. These are great videos, and the ability to jump to the trick I want to do is extremely convenient, as I'm sure anyone who's watched any other magic video, where this is usually impossible, can tell you. The tricks on this video are excellent--very easy to learn, but they still mystify anyone watching. The video is good for not just kids, but adults as well. I'm 24 years old and I still have fun learning how to do what's on this video and seeing peoples faces when the magic is revealed. BUY THIS VIDEO--you won't be disappointed."
2,reapeating tricks,"This video teaches five tricks, that aren't the best, and sixteen different ways of doing those tricks. Two diffeerent tricks would be if the person's card would be in your shoe or your wallet. To me this is not worth the money."
4,Makes half-ball cakes,"It takes much longer to bake a cake in this pan than the instructions say--it took a solid hour for the cake to bake completely (one box mix or one average recipe). I was worried that the edges would be burnt before the center was done, and they were quite firm and brown, but not burnt. This pan is useful for making any type of ball cake, and I have used it for my son's soccer and baseball team parties with great success."
3,Didn't work for me,"I had a frustrating experience with this. Would have been perfect if it actually took one box of cake mix. It looks like I would have been better off using almost two boxes. It rose oddly and took a long time to bake. I am sure the cake mix could have been part of the problem as well, but better instructions from Wilton would have been helpful."
2,The cake didn't have the expected shape when baked,"The cake didn't have the shape of a** ball it was just an ordinary round cake, I couldn't even see the lines of the pan."
4,fun ornament!,"I bought this to add sparkle to a sea life miniatures display, and it certainly does that! It would also look great on a Christmas tree."
3,"Has a good start, but doesn't really go anywhere","The usual I-hate-you-but-I-love-you story line. Kolyn is likeable enough, but Ian is too tough. I found it hard to believe that she could fall in love with him as mean as he is to her at first. It's OK, but not great."
3,"not quite awful, perhaps","I understand the reviewer who found this book awful and unreadable, though I wouldn't go that far. But the character Mori is describing a person who is quiet, unemotional, slow-paced (and who is probably herself), and so the book itself reads quietly, slowly, and unemotionally. Not my idea of a real good read."
4,A good read........but not rememberable,"I read this book a week or so ago and had to brief through a couple of pages to jog my memory about the characters, plot, ending, etc. This kinda let me know that it wasn't one of my favorites; however, I did enjoy the book when I recalled everything and would recommend it as a run-of-the-mill English knight takes Scottish lass love story. I always enjoy a strong female character and Elissa had a spunk about her that made the reading pleasurable. Also, I like the way the English knight Damian had a good heart shown by the way he treated Elissa's mother, sister, and clan.Good man meets good woman......has sorta good couplings.......then, of coarse, looses woman, fights (somewhat) to get her back, she finally sees his worth, they marry, have bairn (or vica versa) and live happily ever after.I always like to have my pleasureable romance readings end happily......and I wasn't disappointed."
4,A Good Read,"This was a great story. Damian and Elissa find love despite the tragedies that have touch both of their lives. Damian an English Knight who fought on Culloden Moor and Elissa the proud Scottish beauty who lost her father and brothers at the same battle. Despite their differences and bigotry of English/Scottish heritage they find love. Of course it is not a smooth path, but then again anything worth having is worth working for.Don't miss this one by Connie Mason it won't let you down"
2,this was my first connie mason book...and last!,"This book was rubbish. it was my first Connie Mason book, and i won't be going back for more. The characters were poor, they both really annoyed me, him being obnoxious, and thinking of nothing but sex, and her, always thinking she was so hard done by and all. There was no love, no developing relationship, just, ""I hate you"" ""no, I want you in my bed"". The story line had potential, but that was the only u p point of this book. A real disappointment as I was looking forward to her book, having heard she was a good author."
2,Pretty Shallow,I agree with everything SWEETHIPS said in her review. I was very disappointed since this is my first Connie Mason book and have heard so much praise about her. It will be a long time before I try another of her books.
4,Really good book,"Just finished it on the Fourth and what a great surprise freebie! The book has brief tidbits of history enough to tie in the framework of the story and the romance, clan hostilities and the merging of Eng/Scot coming together after Culloden was what it was about for the most part. Wasn't sure about the H/H at first seemed a stretch but she finally came around - in a way. Did not expect some of the turns at the end but was glad that I didn't stop reading because I presumed to know how it would end, sometimes I do that, oops. This was entertaining and descriptive the whole time and I will look into more Connie Mason books in the future."
5,Excellent,Loved this story. Connie Mason never disappoints. As soon as I see a book by her I have to read It. Thanks Connie.
1,TERRIBLE,What an awful product. Didn't even last a month! DO NOT BUY! I used this for light gardening and to wash my cars. Within 1 month it had popped a hole in a spot that was defective.
5,Excellent!,"As always, excellent wonderful serious blue grass from the boys. Well recorded and well performed, a must for every Yonder fan!"
4,CD's good but...,"This CD is a very good recording of a very good band but much as a great appreciation of ""Oh Brother, where art thou"" is gained by viewing the movie, ""Mountain Tracks Volume #1"" will be enjoyed more after seeing the band live. Still though, it's good stuff."
5,Mare Winningham is enchanting,"How many of you remember Mare Winningham winning the daily prize on The Gong Show in 1976 as ""Sharon Shamus"" singing Lennon/McCartney's ""Here, There, and Everywhere""? I have been enchanted with her since that moment in time. The audience was enthralled (and surprised!) She's a wonderful actress, and I'll watch her in anything, but it's her singing voice that really touches my soul. I would love to own a recording of Mare's version of ""Hard Times Come Again No More"" from ""Georgia"", but loathe to think I would have to purchase the whole CD in order to have that one song. To echo the sentiment of another reviewer, if I want to hear Jennifer Jason Leigh sing, I'll strangle a couple of cats (no cruelty to animals implied). I also own ""Lonesomers"" and love every moment of it. Dear Mare, please give us more of your musical talent!Lily Marlowe - Denver, CO"
2,Quite disappointing actually,"I own and enjoy all of the Negativland recordings, and have seen them live on a number of occasions. ""I want a piece of toast!"" But this DVD is a disappointment. A large disappointment. There's just not much anything here. The visuals are less than inspired, and are generally less ""experimental"" than the typical no-budget 1980s music video. Honestly I thought that the visuals detracted only from the music, but would be willing, in the best of worlds, to say that they were merely inessential.I'm giving this two stars in generosity to Negativland and perhaps a willingness to call this a noble, but failed, experiment."
2,option education,"The book is old and the information not with the current trading practices. Please note all the information is correct and the techniques are there, as well as teaching the basics very well. I would look for a newer edition of the authors work if someone wanted the latest methods as the markets keep changing and evolving so medthods must as well."
2,Hadfield is enamored with himself.,"In the book, Hadfield features himself a huge success in business. When he discovered the franchising world, it was short lived, as his fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants style soon ate him up. Any time you view and treat your customers as the enemy, it's going to get you. All through the book, there are hints of a hard nosed approach to business. Kwik Kopy's fall from grace, beginning with the RICO suit to the hard times of the 2000's, including Hadfield's unsuccessful attempt to use the courts for enrichment, show the reader the pitfalls of Hadfield's ""Unconventional Wisdom."""
4,Execellent!,"Most people should remember bryon from george dukes early work... Dukey stick, reach for it ect... This is his first solo cd. Full of fun funk style bass playing.A must to complete you bass players collection of cd's.. Lots of fun to listen to."
5,U.S. Submarines through 1945: An Illustrated Design History,Quite simply THE authoritative work on post-World War Two American submarines and the design and tactics philosophies that went into creating them. The photographs were well-chosen and the line drawings are some of the best I've seen of U.S. subs.
4,absolutly wonderful !,I was in stitches all through this movie. Jack Nicholson was hilarious. It was my oldest brothers dying wish to see this movie. He had seen part of it at my home before his illness. When his health failed he asked to see this movie. My sister-in-law and I searched all over trying to find Fortune to rent but to no avail. This is one of my all time favorite movies!
4,Do not take this one lightly!,"Walter made this recording days before he fled Nazi Germany. Many of the musicians, some of whom might have played for Mahler - and in the Walter-conducted premiere of the work - were soon swept up in the Third Reich as well, either as victims, refugees, or, sadly, supporters. The result is - surprisingly enough for Walter - a lean, brisk, tense, almost angry account that, even with the dated sonics (which can be ignored), remains one of the more powerful and tragic accounts of the Ninth ever made. Those who prefer a rich, achingly beautiful rendering should look elsewhere. The diehard Mahlerian should not be without it, no matter how many Ninths he or she owns."
4,"Good, but you should know...","This is a fine recording of a great opera, but I think people should know about the sound quality issue before puchasing it. The acoustic is very odd--narrow and reverberent...it is like you are listening to a very clear am radio broadcast...it sounds as if they just played the LPs and made the CD recording from that, rather than using original tapes. It definitely does NOT sound like a digitally remastered recording from 1970. I wouldn't tell anyone not to get this recording, since it is good, but you should know about this issue before you buy it, and you can't always tell from the sound samples on amazon (even when they are there...)"
4,"FUN, KICK A&% TAKE NAMES NEVER MOVIE!",Throw away any preconceived notions on what an Asian or Western should be because this movie mixes it all up in a great way. Have fun watching and make up your own mind instead of depending on what all the reviews say. The ending is pretty badass too.
4,Action Movie That Does not take itself seriously,"First let me say that this movie is will not win an academy award (but those are usually not the ones that good anyway). This is an action movie. The bad guys are clearly bad and the good, well they have their flaws but you root for them anyway.If you like action with an old west twist this is a great rental. You won't be disappointed."
5,Nice directed movie with hint of comedy in between. Terrific action packed sequences,The Warriors Way is really exciting to watch. It has really good action scenes along with good humor in between. Nice direction
4,A unique movie.,This is one of my favorite new movies. I love the unique way it was filmed and directed and the mix of western and Japanese action styles!
1,Just like a Porno,"You know how you can only watch a porno with thte sound off to make it a good movie? Same goes for this, if you watch it with the sound off it looks pretty cool. If you watch it with the sound on, it's f***ing hilariously bad."
3,bloody/cheesy good story though.,"it was a interesting movie. very random and different. it was sad, angry, happy and crazy. rerrrrrrrrrr r r rrrrr rrrr rrrr rrr r rr r rr r r rrrr rrr"
4,Toss out Disc 1 and Crank Disc 2,"I was kind of disappointed with the first disc in the set since it seems like they just picked the first three songs off each of their LP's. However, the second disc more than makes up for the disappointment. The B-sides are excellent and the live songs show the raw aspect of Ronnie Martin's emotion and musical smarts. It's still a must have for any Starflyer fan, and i guess the first disc is a decent introduction to the band's past accomplishments."
1,Don't buy!,"Didn't even work, threw it away. Disappointed with the quality. I even had my husband try to get it to work, thinking I was doing it wrong."
1,Don't waste your money,"Cheaply made, don't waste your money. Wouldn't pop open from a piece of paper let alone a toilet seat. Really sad, I ordered two! Threw both in the trash within 5 minutes of opening"
2,Bolton?,"Warren Hill is the Michael Bolton of smooth jazz; listen to a few of Hill's songs and you'll know what I mean. I'll let you decide if that's good or bad.The screeching sax during the endless ""nah-nah-nah""'s of Hey Jude: it doesn't get much worse than this."
2,Poor Quality,"It looks like and does have everything I need for my variety of guns. However the larger of the rods broke the first time I used it and the smaller rod for the 17 caliber is near breaking. I have already replaced the larger rod with a kleenbore that is really nice and durable but it does not work with any of the ""universal"" attachments in this set. I would not recommend this set unless you want to buy a more durable set of rods, I guess with the same brand to ensure it works with the attachments."
4,gun cleaning case,"I was pleased with the gun-cleaning kit, except for the fact that it does not come with any oil or solvent. The case is not very sturdy, but is acceptable. Just don't throw it around!"
2,Poor quality case,"This set is very complete and it is convenient to have all my cleaning supplies in one place; however this case is of extremely poor quality. The silver edges appear to made out of aluminum but the broad surfaces are cheap plastic. It feels extremely flimsy and may break at any moment. The components are not held in place by foam as the picture indicates, they are actually in more thin plastic. Overall I find it very overpriced for the quality."
2,VERY POOR QUALITY,"I received the gun care kit with case and I was extremely disappointed by the quality. The case is supposed to be made out of aluminum, however, it looks and feels more like plastic that is colored to look like aluminum. VERY POORLY MADE!"
2,Erskine Caldwell at his worst,"Erskine Caldwell wrote some great novels, including TOBACCO ROAD, GOD'S LITTLE ACRE, JOURNEYMAN and TROUBLE IN JULY.He wrote some crap, too. JENNY BY NATURE is one of them.The whole story reads as if it should have been written twenty years earlier. Literally, the middle-aged main characters seem to be acting out things they should have done in their youth.Skip this one unless you have been assigned to write about Caldwell's lesser-known works."
1,Waiting for a solution,"I had originally purchased this relying on user reviews. Unfortunately, so far after several installation attempts and a call to Actiontec support (very courteous support), I am still unable to use it. It might be based upon my ASUS motherboard (2000) USB bridge system (VIA), but unknown right now and Actiontec did not understand why it was not working. I will try it on another computer and update this review. Until then, not working equals one star."
2,software installation has issues with windows xp pro,"I can't get this to install correctly on my laptop... the software keep picking up my lotus notes id file and when i tried to plug it in... it says it can't find the inf file, sucks"
5,Great little device,"After getting my Tapwave Zodiac that has built-in Bluetooth, I wanted to use the Bluetooth to Hotsync and browse the WEB. I picked the Actiontec USB adapter mostly because it was the cheapest and I wasn't sure if it would work all that great. It took about 6 hours to get everything setup, but that wasn't due to this device. The adapter installed in minutes (follow the manual completely!) and works very well. It is fast and has a good range. I am impressed. I recommend this little USB adapter for ease of setup and price/performance."
2,Madame Hydrangea,"This shearling bootie feels good and looks good.It has a flexible, rubberized sole, which workswell for running outside quickly.However I have only worn it for less than a monthand bits and pieces of the shearling are coming offthe cuff. Already there is about a one inch ""bald spot""and I am seriously considering returning them.I can't imagine they will last very long."
3,Bearpaw in my craw.,"This product is well made, durable, warm and comfortable when properly sized to fit. The product was delivered on time and met my expectations upon first perusal however once worn my views changed slightly. The slippers run large to size, the black dye stains my feet (so I have to wear socks) and the black sole leaves black skid marks on my hardwood floors. Other than that they are great."
4,Gift of Bearpaw Women's 402 Traditional Bootie/slipper,"The recepient of my gift of the Bearpaw Women's Bootie/slippers informed me that they fit perfectly and were warm and comfortable. The hard sole allowed her to wear them to take out the trash or go to the mailbox. The winter, there, has been long and cold. I was very pleased."
3,Good product but watch out for the foam.,"This is a quality product that provides exactly what the description says. I found the taste acceptable and the price is indeed exceptional. My only real disappointment with the product was with the mixing. It does not stir well so you really need to shake with water. However, you need to do this just a SMALL amount of water first and then once the powder has mixed in then you can carefully add more water along the side of the container so that you avoid the excessive amounts of foam that form if you just shake with the desired amount of water.I am currently trying several brands. If I don't find another that I like as well then I would definately buy this again."
2,It was fun for 2 days,We bought this slide two weeks ago. We used it twice. After each use we dried it and stored it as the directions suggested. We tried to use it again today but the top section won't inflate. After an hour waiting for the customer service line we were told that the inner part of the slide has probably separated from the outer part. The customer service operator acted as if this was a common problem. WOWWe now have to go through a process of returning it to the manufacturer.It will take a while to receive a replacement and summer is almost over. The slide was really fun for those TWO days we actually used it. I am very disappointed.
3,"Fun, but not so professional...","This video has it's good and bad points:Good - good variety of old/new Aerosmith songs, overall good energy and performance (I give it a ""B""), fun to watch the band in a smaller venue and their interaction with the audience members and each other. No distracting interviews or narration - just straight performances.Bad - the video portion of this show is better than the audio. Mixing and editing is less than profesional. This is a benefit concert and someone decided to record it and then release it. It's an Import dvd - I can't tell if the sale of this dvd further benefits the charity or not.Aside from the technical issues, I overall liked this video. I only paid $10 for it though!"
1,Not worth it,"Self-indulgent book about the author's coming of age as an adult. Not much self-discovery, but lots of self congratulation. The author misses no opportunity to let you know how funny everyone thinks he is! The ad copy for the author's favorite beer brands and Chicago restaurants is blatant."
5,I love this book!,"Ron Ehrens is a great author! This book is funny, charming and a page turner. I felt like a knew the characters. His writing style is quick and witty. I can't wait for Ron's second novel."
5,Blue Moon by Ron Ehrens,"I LOVED IT!!! This was one of the best books I have read in the last 2 years! Ron Ehrens has a winner for his first. After about 3 chapters everybody knows someone like Seth whether it is themselves, their brother, or a friend. Sometimes you feel sorry for him, sometimes you love him, but most times you wonder ""exactly what was he thinking!"" By the end everyone simply loves Seth. Can't wait for the next installment so I can laugh out loud all over again! Thanks Ron Ehrens for such an enjoyable book! Bring the next one on."
5,Blue Moon,"Seth Gold-I'm sure we all can relate to or we know someone just like him, jewish or not. I loved reading from his perspective, thanks Ron. All the characters come to life. I also enjoyed the tie-ins with Springsteen's lyrics. Can't lose there. A great book for where ever you are, just be prepared for the looks you will surely get because of the laughing out loud you'll be doing. Looking forward to the sequel."
4,Very funny!,"This book was very entertaining to read. Seth is a laugh out loud funny character-his sarcasm is refreshingly amusing. It's a good book for all audiences-it has humor, romance and adventure. I especially enjoyed the references to Chicago where the first part of the book takes place. It feels like you are right there with him experiencing his struggle to find the right person. I'll be waiting for the movie!"
5,Very important book.,"This book should be required reading in every high school civic class. Gilens dispels the myths of the ""deserving"" and ""undeserving"" poor and the myths of the racial composition of welfare recipients. The text is extremely well researched and clearly written. I highly recommend this book to everyone."
4,They covered it all!,"I liked the way it was written, kind of like a conversation. It was easy to see both Holly's & Michelle's views - which complimented each other. It helped me to regain perspective on being single and that it really isn't all that bad. I know that God wants a more intimate relationship with me, and I am honored that I get to be only His. Thank you Holly & Michelle for your encouragement and sometimes a ""slap back to reality"".I would recommend this book to anyone who struggles with being single. This book covers all the bases and is very straight forward. The honesty and openness of these two ladies is very encouraging and helpful."
1,What a waste!!,"I just couldn't wait for this DVD to arrive at my doorstep... Now I regret even opening the box. This DVD has absolutely no meaning to fans wanting to learn more about this great band. Instead, it's an amateur production of interviews with a few DJ's. Don't expect hear or see any actual footage of Rammstein either... just a few pictures from an old show and no music.So do yourself a favor and move on past this one and buy the REAL THING instead - you'll be glad you did."
3,Autoart,"When I recieved package,I have seen that car's base plate was broken into 3 pieces and car was floating in the Autoart box, unfortunately right mirror from car was broken out. What is sruprising is that Exterior Cartoon Package was not damaged, so it doesn't seem as Box was damaged while carrying. As it seem base plate was already broken when given to carrier.I wrote company and only asked what should be done about the broken base plate and mirror, but there was not any reply. After a week I wrote to Amazon that my contact to them was not replied.Amazon payed back price of car to my credit card. Thanks to Amazon.But I have paid $5 shipping at the beginning.Quality from Autoart is good as many times before. the thing I like most with Autoart cars is carpet interior."
4,I'm impressed...,"Shoottokill, written and produced by Ak1200 is definitely a nice addition to my Dance & DJ collection. This CD is full of great beats, high energy and wonderful vocals. Ak1200 offers a nice blend of D&B and Hip/Hop that will be sure to energize just about anyone. Ak1200 has proven himself to be a great artist as well as a great producer.This is definitely worth a listen."
4,soild 3,"Descent mix, repeatious, I would check out his other cds before buyin this one, cds ugly too if that matters... B-"
5,WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU IT'S AK1200!!,"omg! it's AK1200 how can you say it's a disgrace to Drum and base? how can you?? it's not that much different then what they have been doing. same fast style playing that can raise your spirits. granted yeah some of their old stuff is better and will always remain thee best, but the CD is not a disgrace. that's just wrong. some songs aren't up to par but the whole CD isn't bad. i enjoy it very much so, it's why i gave it a 5 i bought it like 2 years ago and i still love it. ok the phife dawg wasn't the best idea but hell not everything has to be perfect and it makes an excellent party song. (good memories good memories) Dude i'm not raggin on you, cause we all are entitled. I'm just stating i think your a little too harsh with the disgrace comment. it's AK1200 dude show a little more respect then that."
4,instant wine chiller,"Pretty good for slightly chilling wine you'd forgotten to put into the fridge before serving, or for keeping a chilled bottle cold for a little longer."
4,Repackaged Walbro,"First off, this is a great replacement fuel pump kit that comes with everything you need to install. I'm not sure if it's just an indication of the condition of the original stock pump, but this one is much quieter than the stock one.Why it didn't get 5 stars: It's a repackaged Walbro pump so you end up spending more for the BBK name on the box. Save some money and just by the Walbro packaged pump (Unless you're like me and got the free shipping from Amazon).Installed in:1987 Ford Mustang GTBone stock 5.0L (Future 347 stroker)"
4,Relatively Obscure Rossini,"Although this opera's overture is very well known, the opera itself has been only infrequently recorded in its entirety over the years. I heard it first on XM Radio's Vox channel and purchased this CD set that night. Despite being a live performance, the sound is good and the singers are not obscured, although at times there is some stage ""stomping"" that can reduce the enjoyment of the recording. Nevertheless, the singing of Katia Ricciarelli, William Matteuzzi, Samuel Ramey are what you would expect of seasoned performers and Gianluigi Gelmetti demonstrates his long experience in conducting Rossini. This has become one of my favorite Rossini recordings."
5,"A monument to the immortal words, ""I can!""","What is it about bicycles that make a certain brand of men and women strive to do what other people only dream about?Auerbach's movie gives an up-close and personal view of what drives the cyclists who pedal across deserts, mountain ranges and plains coast-to-coast in the Race Across America.You feel their pain and personal struggles, you cry over their tragedies and you share their exhilaration when they finish. You hear in their own words what makes them push themselves beyond normal human limits.By the end, you'll know the answer to the question: What do you call the last cyclist to cross the RAAM finish line?A winner."
5,Intestinal Fortitude at it's Finest,"I'm writing with prejudice, I am a cyclist. Never have I witnessed such a crystal clear depiction of what it feels like to spend hours on the bike. I am awed by Auerbach's prospective, he made you feel as if you were there with the RAAM competitors. You felt their pleasure and pain. You understood why they were doing this. This documentary made sense of what could easily be misconstrued as a ridiculous attempt for recognition. It is doubtful that RAAM soloist finishers will ever become famous, but they will have a sense of satisfaction few others will ever achieve.""I have reason to believe the grass might be a little greeneron the other side"" - Bob Schneider"
4,FOR CRAZY PEOPLE,"Really, this gem is only for hard-core cyclists and/or people that like to go to the extreme in physical endurance type of activity. I liked it a lot and it was very well done. It's not for everyone but I'm sure the people who have seen this or participated in a like event/activity can certainly relate to what occurs in the film."
5,Excellent Film!,I am a cyclist and runner and enjoy films about both. I watched this film with my 18-year-old son and we were in awe of the cylists. I'm still amazed at what they went through in their journey across the US. While I think they're quite mad -- it was fasinating and inspiring. I highly recommend adding this DVD to your collection!
5,Bicycling Dreams,"When I saw this movie described on a cycling website I frequent, I knew I had to see it. Yes, I'm an endurance cyclist, not a very good one, but a passionate one. This movie portrays just about everything a long distance cyclist endures while riding across America. The physical challenge is immense, but it's the mental challenge that can put one over the edge. This group of cyclists, some unknown to each other, come together to challenge themselves. One doesn't understand their motivations until you see this movie, but once you get to know them individually, it becomes more clear. Yet, you wonder, and they do too, why they really do it and if it's worth it. Only they can answer that question. See this movie even if you're not a cyclist. You'll be inspired."
5,Wonderful!,"My family has watched it three times, so far. This is the ""Old Yeller"" of bicycle movies. Exciting, suspensful,touching, and very uplifting. What a fabulous job the filmakers did in bringing this story to us. An epic journey! If this movie doesn't get you on a bike I don't know what will."
5,Awesome Documentary,Worth the $19.95. If your into cycling or endurance events then you have got to see this film. It captures the human spirit and is very well documented. Tragic and Inspiring.
3,Bicycle Dreams Review,"The film is depressing and somewhat disjointed, but I had no problems with the venfor. It wrrived on time and in perfect condition. The content and structure of the film are what turned me off. The cast of characters in the film keeps expanding as it runs, and that gave the initial impression that the field of riders was smaller than it actually was. The rambling nonsense that comes from exhausted rider's mouths isn't helpful - I think the film could have used more external analysis and a consistent point of view intellectually. Even documentaries can have a point of view, and don't have to focus exclusively on the participants of the even. Background on extreme event physiology, sleep deprivation, and training for extremely long duration events could have provided an effective backdrop for a more compelling story."
4,For the enthusiast,"This movie is for the true cycling enthusiast. Everyone, who things the condition and strength of your body is good, should see this movie for inspiration to climb further up the lader.Fantastic performance in a low budget film..."
2,Cheap,"My favorite bicycle movie is Hell on Wheels (Höllentour), with its inventive angles, atmospheric shots, dynamic editing, bits of history, and nice music. Well, Bicycle Dreams doesn't have any of that. It does, however, almost show a rider being killed - thankfully, not the crash itself, but the reactions of the fellow participants in real time. Not entirely tasteful I think.Hell on Wheels, while following the 2003 Tour de France, cleverly avoids showing the podium scenes, time standings etc. - a trick that seems especially brilliant now that we know what happened to the overall winner. Bicycle Dreams, of course, keeps telling the race positions all the time. Think reality tv rather than arthouse cinema... It's a very unsophisticated take on an obscure event that perhaps makes it seem even more bizarre than it actually is."
5,Unreal movie!!,"Awesome movie for the sports enthusiasts! Want to see people push themselves past human limits, this is the documentary to get!!!"
5,Awesome Endurance Sports Story,Recommended to anyone into endurance sports. And even some who are not. Great story about pushing the limits. Incredible what these people put themselves through.
2,DUD!,"Don't waste your money. I purchased this based on rave reviews. it is NOT about cycling, and the photography sucks. There is no frame of reference as far as maps, routes, equipment, how things really work. It is really about people exercising with lack of sleep. Unfortunately someone dies in film and there is this open ended suggestion that a driver purposely crossed over and hit tired cyclist. don't waster your money, its a snooze."
4,"A little slow, but otherwise a cool look at the RAA",Very cool to see some awesome cyclists and what they go through for RAA. I thought it a little slow at times - probably why I bailed in the middle and still haven't finished watching it. Some great camera work.
2,Elementary Insanity,I have to agree with Terry Sue's earlier review. Both my husband and I are cyclists and we were excited about watching this award winning film. It is not anything like the Tour de France. It is biking insanity and shows no real value of the rider's pursuit. We hailed the rider who decided his family was more important than his obsession. Also we felt the film was home made - do not understand the awards given - ??
5,Ugh,"Pussy.That's what this movie made me feel like. Only watch it if you want to feel exactly the same. These dudes are tougher than everybody else on earth, and could probably be waterboarded for 12 hours without even thinking about it, then bang your girlfriend.So basically if you want to get super pumped up about riding a bicycle, watch this movie."
4,see jonbrion dot com,"This is a great score by the multi-talented Jon Brion. Brion's music really fits with Magnolia, as it should. The weakness of this attribute is that the score is better with the movie than without. The score is able to convey the many emotions of the movie, and overall I would recommend it.I would recommend that if you like it go check out jonbrion dot com, and his album meaningless."
4,A wonderful score from a talented artist,Jon Brion's beautifully understated score nicely complements the songs of Aimee Mann and the fine acting featured in P.T. Anderson's sprawling masterpiece. Influences of Danny Elfman can definitely be felt in the closing title track. A must have for fans of the film. Hopefully coming soon -- Jon Brion's long delayed solo debut album!
4,An excellent Star Trek novel,"This is an extremely well-written and thought-provoking novel -- one of the best in the Star Trek series. Characters are nicely developed, plot lines are intriguing, and everything fits in nicely with the established Star Trek universe. The novel is partly a morality play, but it never gets preachy. Occasionally author Jean Lorrah is unable to sustain interest among her multiple plot lines, but ""The IDIC Epidemic"" is still an entertaining read."
4,A follow up to The Vulcan Academy Murders,"I.D.I.C.--Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combination. That has always been the heart of Vulcan ideals. But will it stay that way?The planet Nisus has 11 humaniod species living & working together, and in some cases, married. It also has a deadly plague. And the only ones that appear immune to it are the sole Klingons living there. Is this a plot, a test of a new biological warfare weapon by the Klingons?The Enterprise is sent to investitgate, with Spock's parents, Daniel Corrigan & T'Mir, his Vulcan wife, & Sorel, her father (characters from The Vulcan Academy Murders) on board. As Corrigan, T'Mir, Sorel, & McCoy try despartely to find a cure, the story starts revolving around a young Vulcan woman who has been adopted by a Vulcan family. T'Pina's natural parents are unknow, and on a planet full of diverse species, this story comes into it's own as to why T'Pina may become their best and only hope.A good read for Star Trek fans"
3,Doesnt fit,Doesnt fit my grandsons bike unless you take off rubber grip even then its short i should have sent it back but saying that the other 2 i purchased for my nephews fitted their bikes and they loved them so check dimensions before you buy.
4,"Again, again!","My daughter (almost 3) is obsessed with this book. We got it out of the library and it's now been returned and she keeps asking for it. I'm going to have to purchase it. It spurred us to make cookies ourselves (something we'd never done--although we did not make the dough from scratch), and it is a jumping point for all kinds of conversation about cooking, working, buying and, most importantly, SLEEPING (as Mr. Cookie Baker has to go to bed at the end of the day himself). I would highly recommend it!"
3,Arrived somewhat damaged,This book arrived somewhat damaged. Since it was for our family and not terribly damaged we didn't try to return or complain. It was shipped in a box that was slightly too small so the binding was bent and the book was bent in the center. We could still use it so we didn't bother with the complaint.
4,Pretty funny!,"My 4-year old son LOVES Richard Scarry books and LOVES fire fighters; so, purchasing this book was a no-brainer. It is pretty silly, but I've enjoyed reading it every night for a week! Enjoy reading it better than ""Richard Scarry's A Day at the Fire Station."" Wish they hadn't named one of the fire fighters, Squirty. Funny (and a little disturbing) that the fire fighting pigs cook hot dogs at their barbeque; I just imagine that they are turkey dogs! ;-)"
4,cute book,This is a cute book for my 2 1/2 year old. His Dad is a firefighter and he likes this one too for toddlers.
2,Doesn't match the TV show,"Good story, but I was disappointed that it didn't match the TV episode of the same name. It would have been nice if the kids could follow along."
3,Decent basic overview of irritable bowel syndrome,"As a physician who suffers from diarrhea-predominant IBS, I am interested in pursuing alternative therapies. I have done acupunture, Chinese herbs and rolfing in addition to dietary restriction, two rounds of Xifaxan, and meditation. I found the book interesting reading but believe that some of the information is outdated or incorrect especially in reference to suggested diets. I did like that the author discussed several alternative therapies for the treatment of IBS. I suffer from certain food sensitivities/intolerances which is also addressed in the book."
5,A beautiful concept - easy to put to use!,"I have used ""Matrix Repatterning"" with patients who would not respond to the usual methods I use in chiropractic practice.This is a beautiful concept that I have only recently been exposed to. It has practical validity.Peter Robb DC"
3,"I'm unable to relate to what they are into, however......","I've been a massage therapist for over 24 years.. Thousands of massages. With my current palpation skills, I'm unable to detect the suttle differences in body tone that they are talking about? However, after checking out their website, they seem to be helping a lot of people. Im more inline with Soft Tissue Release, Muscle Release, Active Release, Rossiter Method, and Trigger Point Work. I know you can get very very good results seeing practitioners of those methods too, as long as they are experienced. A very interesting book. However it doesnt (so far) work for me."
4,It's still old Metallica!,"This concert is nearly 3 hours long which should satisfy any Metallica fan. I would have preferred that they release the Seattle concert! It's not quite as long but it's all from 'Justice...' and before, but I'm sure the 18 million people that bought the black CD will prefer this. Professionally done and the sound is not bad stereo for 1992. Again, I hope they'll release the 1989 Seattle concert on DVD, that way people won't have to purchase the expensive 'Binge and Purge' to get these concerts on DVD."
2,Unfortunate punctuation,"I very much liked the plot and the characters in this book. For the most part this is a light, fun read. That being said I had a slight problem with the punctuation. It seemed every sentence of the dialogue ended with an exclamation point! It made me feel as if the characters were shouting at me! And it wasn't just a select few! It was all of them! Even the minor characters with only one sentence! It gave the impression that every character was either hard of hearing or extremely excited!!"
2,Didn't expected much but was still disappointed,On the plus side all the women on this cover actually appear in the movie and there was a good woman vs woman fight and a decent woman vs man fight. On the minus side those were the only two fights in the entire film and women mostly did these weird strip teases where they remained fully clothed. Watching a woman dressed like C3PO try to do a strip tease is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen and yet a highlight of this movie.
3,Interesting,"A must see for horney teenagers, plus kitty is now an adult film star so seeing her in a real movie is fascinating. Action was okay if you like women fighting(who dosen't). Running time is short but for 7 bucks and some change not ot bad"
5,One of her best stories!,"This has been one of my favorite Danielle Steel books for a long time. I really enjoy her early works the best, and the characters seem to be more realistic, though their struggles are heartwrenching and devastating. This one is no exception. It's hard enough to lose a spouse or a child, but to lose both... then have to raise a handicapped child that will never meet his father or sister... and to do this all alone... well, all I can say is Danielle Steel takes real life tragedies, and pushes them to find out how much her characters can take... then pushes them a little more. This one will have you crying for the devastating loss, then crying for the heartwarming mother-son relationship. There is so much more to this story, and anyone that has ever read Danielle Steel will know that her stories take you on a roller coaster ride, and make you walk away a different person than the one you were before."
5,Touching,"This was my second book and it was a touching love story. It starts off at the present when Daphne gets caught in an accident. She goes back to the time when she first meets Jeff and how she lost him and how she gave up. Then John comes along and it tells how how she also lost him in the same tragic way she lost Jeff. Then it moves along after that and how she finally gave up on love then it goes back to the morning when she finally woke up from the accident. I can say that it has a pretty sweet ending. I can't tell you all, I'll spoil the suprise! note: This is such a good book! Try it and you won't be sorry!"
3,Pure drama and romance,"When I first started reading this book, I thought ""just another love story"", but then I got in trouble with my boyfriend and it made me feel that I really needed him and I couldn't face life alone. It is a must for romantic souls!!!"
5,Once in a Lifetime,"By far the best Danielle Steel book that I have ever read. From the beginning to the end this book had captured my interest. I literally had to put my kindle down just to cry and reflect on what i just read. I can sympathize with Daphne having a disabled son of my own. I have read many of DS's novels and I loved all of them, but this novel is the best one so far.... hands down."
4,It was a grig time and I liked it,"I really did like this book, although i had seen the tv movie before i read the book, and there was a lot of different things going on in the book that i didn't know about. But i would have to say, that this book kind of depressed me, because Daphne kept having people come into her life and then die, But other than that sappy crap, i really liked it"
3,Not What I Expected,"I'm not sure that I simply misunderstood the book description, but I was disappointed that this is simply a compilation of several 'successful' peoples' accounts of their attainment of their goals. Not what I wanted or thought it was."
1,cant belive IDIOTS buy this thing !!!!,You have to be a complete and total idiot to buy this. hahahaha. So many losers in this world.
1,LACK OF SERVICE,"Have still not received...after several weeks,,, any information as to how to order repair service. My unit is not working but I have no way to have it repaired....Very, very dissappointed..........."
1,Very Poor Service,"I purchased a service plan from NEW Corp through Amazone. I never received any information from this company confirming my warranty. In fact they had no record of my purchase. They had charged my credit card for the warranty and then failed to actually provide a warranty. It has taken repeated phone calls, and undelivered promises of ""it's in the mail"". I will never again purchase a warranty from this company. They are unreliable at best."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR $$$",This is a terrible deal...read the fine print if you can find it! Amazon should not even be offering this!
1,Con Artist,"Gave me a break, this was a true con artist. amazon should drop from his advertisment. This makes double con ! Increadible, try to rip off the client by giving false advertisement. What you see in the ad is not what you get. BE CAREFUL"
4,Service Plan,"I have yet to use this service plan for my new PDA, but I am glad I have one that lasts three years and at such a great price. The reason for 4/5 stars is because I have not yet used the plan and I may have a different opinion when I see the company in action."
5,Absolutely fantastic!!!,"This book is a must read!! The author does an absolutely fantastic job of conveying the emotions that all the characters are feeling. You feel as if you are right there with Cain, the main character, through all of his misfortunes as well as his triumphs. I laughed and cried and literally could not put the book down."
1,The third edition is almost the same as the second edition!!,"This is a revised version of answers to GMAT AWA questions. However, the authors failed to add the latest questions and the content is almost the same as the second edition. I felt so disappointed at it. I don't recommend anyone who had the previous edition to buy it."
3,"Very useful, poor explanations",The book is very useful because have a lot of sample responses to both the analysis-of-an-issue and analysis-of-an-argument questions. The problem is that the book does not give sufficient information in tips or techniques for write a good essay and the format of the book is very poor and bored.
1,Questions Are No Longer Available Online!,"I ordered this book online. When I received the book, I was surprised to find that no questions are available in the book. I followed the instructions in the book to download the questions, but it 's a dead link!!! I could not find any other information on publisher's site. Do not buy this book unless you can find the questions to match the essays."
1,Waste of money and time,"Really really disappointing. Never ever buy this book. Reasoning, sentence structure,... every thing is poor poor poor"
3,Quite good,The book gives you sample answers to all (?) essay questions. I think it would be more helpful if there was more general information on how to write essays.
4,good intro to work with mythical beasts,i just finished reading this book. and i enjoyed since i learned so much. most of these creatures i did not even know exist. what was fun and informative to read.
3,"""Arthur's Baby"" -- Not the Best of Arthur","I don't know which came first, the TV script or the book. But this is one of those situations in which the PBS video is better than the book.While `Arthur's Baby' is a good story, in book form it fails to *bring home the message* the way that the video does. In the video, considerable time is spent showing that the baby is comfortable with Arthur's holding her, and that Arthur has some `basic' baby knowledge that D.W. just can't have because she is so much younger.The book text just doesn't get this across. The baby begins to cry and in 8 lines after Arthur picks up Kate, the story comes to a conclusion with an unceremonious burp.Three Stars. Okay book, but if you will have to explain the message to all but the most adroit kids."
1,Ulitimate support 2nd tier - a joke!,"This was horrible. I ordered this as a second tier for my IQ 2000 stand. It said in the manual that if you need a second tier, order this, so I did. When I received it, it didn't even come close to fitting. No matter what I tried. I am a mechanical engineer and I know how to adjust things if needed. This was WAY OFF - not even close to fitting into the stand. I left two complaints to Ultimate Support with no response. I have owned Ulitmate Support products for years and always found them to be excellent. This is just junk. The IQ 2000 itself seems to work ok, but even with that, the locking plate was mount backwards and would not lock. I had to disassemble the stand and reverse it myself. I had to litterlaly machine down the end of the 2nd tier and make my own adapter to get it to fit at all. I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS PRODUCT."
5,Easy to install,"This unit was easy to install. Now, my Roadmate 760 gets live traffic updates. In addition to being able to see roadwork, accidents, and other impediments on the map, the routing will adjust for them. It seems that the estimated travel time is more accurate now as well.An unexpected benefit of this kit was the software upgrade that came with it. Several roads near us were always spoken by their less common names (e.g. ""V-62"") instead of the primary names (e.g. ""Quentin Road""). Now, the unit speaks the more common names of these roads. Maps were not updated, though. They are still quite old."
4,Traffic Kit,"Found it fairly to self install and everything appears to be working but I have not been near any of the traffic problems listed in the 'warning', so I have yet to see the warning icon come up on the screen."
3,Not as good as Village of the Damned.,"I like both versions of Village of the Damned. The children are eerie and a little scary, so cold-blooded and cruel. The children in this movie, six children from different countries staying in an abandoned church in London, don't look as eerie and seem to be confused rather than evil. The small town in the first movie is also a more interesting environment than the big city in this sequel.The acting is quite fair but the screenplay is far from as good as the one of the first movie. The cinematography is quite good, but this sequel should have been better, but it's not a bad movie, watch this if it is on TV but don't pay too much to see it. If you have seen neither of them, watch Village of the Damned, it's quite much better. I give this movie 6 points of 10. I wouldn't buy this movie."
3,Another uneven sequel to a classic. . .,"Perhaps Children of the Damned would have been a lot more effective had it not been for the heightened expectations created by the original Village of the Damned. By itself, it's not a bad little chiller, combining strong elements of suspense, horror, some unintentional humor, and adequate special effects. The plot is a bit too predictable and the action too slow in developing. The action/horror sequences lack the surprise and unpredictability of the earlier film, but are decent in their own right. This is a perfect three-star effort, not too good, not too bad. If you really like modern variations of gothic horror, you'll enjoy Children of the Damned. If you only like truly good horror films, or your tastes lean markedly in another direction, this one probably isn't worth the effort."
2,rehash of old myth,"Read any abductees' tales fron the '60's and you will have better than this effort. Gilbert seems to have had some experience concerning ufo phenomena, but it is the same as anyone who has ever seen a grade b sci-fi movie (and if the genre interests you, please rent some ancient film or read an account from the time before commercial wannabes began staking thier claim to extraterrestial turf). If you,feel a need to be ""taken"" to another realm by all means buy this volume, if you've been taken enough, shun it."
3,"Not easy to follow, but full of important information.","Admittedly, Joy's book is not easy to read in terms of writing style. However, I have attended lectures and other events she led, and I've found her to have one of the most amazing stories I've ever heard. Joy's message is profound & impacting - the book itself doesn't impress me that way, but for anyone who actually contacts the author to attend her lectures or meditation trainings, I can honestly say it could change your life in a most powerful way."
4,sanity in alien abduction literature,"I was terrified of the alien abduction concept until I found Joy Gilbert's book. Gilbert is not a great writer but she IS a great experiencer and is to be lauded all the more for having the courage to try to express herself. Having now spent nearly a decade doing further UFO and alien research since I first found her book, I still consider it to be a cornerstone for understanding that what is really going on, and to trust that the process is essentially positive. Thank you Joy."
4,Costs a bit more but great lightscribe performance,"This is one of the few brands of ""lightscribe"" products that works well with my LITE-ON burners.Contrast levels are great and printing doesn't fade over time.Unfortunatley, not many local stores carry TDK brand.Most stores in my area sell a lot of Memorex media, which is cheap cheap cheap.So, now I have to buy TDK online.My only gripe is that the price of the lightscribe CD-R spindle was the same as that of the lightscribe DVD-R spindle."
1,Extremely Unhappy with Product,"These toys are very cute; however, the sound is loud and irritating. It not only drove us crazy, but the dog as well. Do not buy this toy."
2,Mouth Rinse For Dogs,This was a complete waste of money. The bottle was so small that it lasted only a few days. Could not continue to order since I have two dogs and this would be very costly. Will not order again
1,Was disappointed in the product because the advertisement did not give me a good description of how to use it.,I did not know that this was something I would put in my dog's water. I was looking for a spray that I could spray directly in his mouth.
1,Be careful.,"This might be partially my fault because I let it sit for so long, but a few months ago I ordered this product and premixed a gallon of the water/mouthwash mixture so it would be easier to fill the dog bowl when it got low. It ending up being a medical cause that was making my dog's breath bad, so once that was fixed, I stopped using the mouthwash. A few months later,I started giving it to my dogs again when my new dog had bad breath. Well I gave it to them about 4-5 times before I noticed that some kind of algae was floating in the gallon of the mixture. Hopefully it's harmless since my dogs have been drinking the water a couple weeks, but I'd be wary of this product because who knows what's in it if it can form algae in a sealed container."
3,Not a True Guide to Trance,This is more of Ameri-Trance instead of my prefered stlye Eruo-Trance. But any way its still a good CD. At first I wasn't shure but afetr a few Tracks I wasn't sad at all. Its more of hypnotic Trance with a little progressive thrown in there. Its still a worth whlie purchase for the price. PLUR!
1,WAY too expensive!!!,"These dolls are great overall...I bought them for the Loving Family Townhouse that I bought used for my daughter, and they go very nicely with it. However, they are extremely over-priced! You can buy them for $5-$6 per 2-pack of the figures (mom and toddler; grandma and brother; dad and sister) at any national toy retailer/discount store. At most, they should cost $20, not $50, especially since they're still widely available (the shelves were full when I bought all three 2-packs this week!)."
2,Very Expensive teeny tiny family,"Awfully expensive for a set of dolls that can all fit in a box that's no more than 3""x5""x2"" big. I would have passed on this set if the description had properly described the size of the dolls."
3,Weird groupings,"So, the house came with parents and twin babies. Would like the brother and sister...but then what do I do with two Daddies?!? Save one in case the first one gets lost/ruined? Why couldn't the sister come with a grandparent like the brother? Or the siblings in a package together?"
3,need to change,"The packaging either needs to be with the mom,dad,brother,and sister or as it used to be sister and brother as it is with the African American packages."
2,Arrived in bad condition...,"They sent me a brush that looked like it had been stepped on with a combat boot! The metal shaft was warped, bent, and breaking.The brush itself seemed like it would have been excellent... had it been sent in good condition. What a shame~Will not purchase Paula Dorf brushes from Amazon again."
3,Worked good until washed,"I really liked using this crease brush to apply a darker shade in my crease using a ""windshield wiper"" /back & forth motion. Then one day, felt this urge to wash it. After I washed it, the bristles fluffed out & the brush became all puffy. It's too puffy & fluffy to use as a crease brush. I'm tempted to take a pair of scissors to it & snip it back into shape. I'm holding off because I'm not so sure that would be a good idea."
1,Was advertised as synthetic- found out it was squirrel!,"I only ordered this brush because description said that the bristles were synthetic. However, I have now learned that this brush was made of squirrel and is NOT cruelty free! I am very upset about this, as I do not ever buy animal hair brushes. I expect a product description to be accurate, especially when I am paying this kind of price for a brush. The brush itself arrived in a timely manner and is in good condition. So if you want to kill animals go ahead and buy it, but just know that the description is not accurate. Also-the handle is very short so I would say this is a personal use item only and not good for work on clients if you are a makeup artist."
1,Duped,"I was so excited to find this CD, featuring all the songs from my youth that were so much fun to dance to. There's nothing like putting on your new CD, looking forward to hearing the songs, only to find out that the songs were performed by a cover band. Bummer. Maybe other people know to look for that, but I naively assumed that the songs were performed by the original artists."
2,incomplete trail description very frustrating,"Just came back from hiking Tumbledown Mt. using the description in the book...What Cloe doesn't tell you is that Loop climbs through boulders to an apparent dead end where you can either do a vertical climb up a rock face (to a ledge which dead ends) or traverse a face up underneath a huge overhanging boulder which has water running out of it...if you try the latter you'll find rungs leading through to the continuation of the trail. But none of this was in the book. We lost about 20 minutes & had to do some fairly technical unprotected climbing before we realized where the trail went. This kind of information is why I would buy a trail guide...as it was, we ended up in a frustrating and potentially dangerous situation b/c of the inadequate description in this book."
3,"critters, humans, and heavens","This work offers something for multiple audiences. Animal lovers and younger people may like seeing baby mountain goats and arctic squirrels. For guys, climbing Denali Mountain is presented like it was an extreme sport. Technically, this mountain is not the only place to see aurora borealis, but like The Simpsons' Superintendent Chalmers, seeing that phenomenon really excited me. The Jungian in me didn't like seeing all those artic worms, to be honest.I've see many discs in the NG series where they have an additional smaller documentary available on the larger one. This did not. I strongly believe that all DVDs should have foreign language subtitles and this disc is lacking that helpful feature."
3,Great Photography,The views are breathtaking. The animal abundance and variety interesting. The difference between the lower praries and the highest peaks was like nowhere else on the planet. It did drag a little too long.
3,Interesting,"In this book the late African-American clinical psychologist, Bobby E. Wright, expounds upon the possible reasons for the white race's documented hostility toward and mistreatment of people of color around the globe. It's a ""hot button"" topic, for sure, so if you're white (or any other color/ethnicity) and easily angered by discussions about white culpability for a large share of the universal suffering of Blacks and other people of color, do not purchase and read this book, for obvious (?) reasons.If, however, you're white (or any other color/ethnicity), sufficiently open-minded and reasonably familiar with the documented history of the relations between whites and people of color, and if you're interested in ""being part of the solution rather the problem,"" then by all means purchase and read this book.That's all, folks!"
2,Not the same,I don't it doesn't feel like the stuff I had before. Same smells the same... but on the skin something's missing!!
3,Decreased peel = decreased purchase,"This used to be the very best marmalade, but a change in recipe has decreased the amount of orange peel in the marmalade. Think one small peel chunk per side of an english muffin. Since I really like the peel, I'm on the lookout for a new brand. Aside from this, if you like a minimal amount of peel, the marmalade is good."
1,Nail Art Brushes,"These brushes are NOT good. They are very low quality. They get stiff after one use (no matter what you use to clean them) and the hairs are totally unruly and end up flinging paint everywhere. I bought these and used them twice before I gave up. I ended up going to my local art store and just buying small brushes there and then trimming them. It cost about $10 for 5 brushes and I was able to tailor them to exactly what I need (there are how-to videos for this on YouTube). I'm not saying skip Amazon (I love Amazon.com, don't get me wrong), but you have to be able to feel the brush before you buy it to know how it's going to work for you. At the very least make sure it's not fake hair. Everyone wants a good deal, but the reality is is if you want to make something that looks nice you can't use crappy equipment."
2,What the .....,"I eagerly awaited this in the mail only to be disapointed. Like the guy who also reviewed the DVD, I thought ""All Access"" ment a lot of cool stuff like the videos and perfomances. Chrome dreams (makers of the DVD) even failed to put Deftones music in the DVD as background music!! They rathered opted to play some sorry, crappy, whinny, rock that sounded like it was punk. Once I finished watching this tragic DVD I realized that I knew pretty much what was discussed about the history of the Deftones, the early years, and so forth was stuff I alredy knew and I could tell you what they missed too. Unless you want to know who was with the Deftones when they were jaming the in early days, dont buy the DVD and surf the web for Deftone history, Or if your too lazy just buy the DVD and expect what you would find on the web. Keep in mind that the DVD was not officially recognized by the Deftones. (That explains it all). You might as well wait for the Deftones to put out their official biography."
3,Clarity of purchase not so good,"The product needs to have a clearer description of how many you are getting for the price and what you need to purchase as an accesory to use them...i.e. clips, pins etc."
4,"Good, but hard on the soul","Pretty depressing, but the man's work is beyond reproach. I find him to be an edgier version of Hemingway, but the unrelenting sadness gets tough to manage after a while. Buy a puppy when you start this book -- you'll need it."
5,Fast Replys!,I received my warranty on my new kitchenaid mixer. upon receiving it i noticed that they had put in as the product covered a blender and not my mixer. i called them this morning expecting to be put on hold. i was not even put on hold i was able to get it corrected in less than 5 minutes. thank you Amazon.
4,Fourth in the Series,"This is a novel by Paul Doherty writing under the pseudonym of Ann Dukthas. Paul Doherty is the consummate professional when it comes to writing historical mystery novels. I for one do not know how he can be so prolific with his offering of books and yet make sure that each of them is well researched. Whether they be 13th, 14th, or fifteenth century they are always true to the period. He also writes about Ancient Egypt and the Greek period in history of Alexander the Great.This is the fourth book in the series featuring Nicholas Segalla, scholar and mystery solver who is capable of travelling through time and has been involved in the solving some of the most famous mysteries in history. In this book he is investigating the very real possibility that Queen Mary is being poisoned by one of her many rivals . . ."
4,A New Genre,"Mary Baxter has created a new genre -- a Romance for the 55+ crowd. It's a light and fun read to follow Mrs. Loomis' flight from a grumpy, carping husband, through the perils of self-sufficiency, into new romance and a final friendly break with a regretful husband. Mrs. Loomis will give lots of unhappy wives pause for thought and reason for hope."
5,Rogue Resonator,"I would only buy a Rogue resonator, for one it's an unbeatable price and two, it's a great quality guitar. Depending on what sound you're aiming for, you may want to immediately change the strings but there's really not a bad thing I have to say about this resonator."
4,Colonel Bruce Hampton's missing years,"After The Hampton Grease Band (their ""Music to Eat"" is collectible as a CD and ultra-collectible as a double LP), Hampton B. Coles/Colonel Bruce Hampton put together The Late Bronze Age, an all-star collection of Atlanta musicians dedicated to the spirit of fun, absurdity, and musical invention that Bruce Hampton has always brought. The group was less jazz oriented than the later Aquarium Rescue Unit, more jazz oriented than the Hampton Grease Band, and a ton of fun. The LBA was originally, I believe, released on Macon's Capricon Records (home of the Allman Brothers), so that should suggest something. A ""jam band"" before that was a term, a surrealist ahead of Robyn Hitchcock, and an innovator to follow the great Frank Zappa, Hampton's records are always three fifths humor and two fifths jaw-dropping musicality. For the later or earlier fans, the Late Bronze Age is the missing item in your collection."
4,HOT! HOT! HOT!,"I bought this book because I love stories about cowboys. I am not sure if this is the first or second book about three brothers. The next one will be out soon. In this one a woman comes back to town for a friends wedding and finds her old high school crush is just as hot as ever. A bad boy in his youth, he has settled down and now wants to marry a good girl. But Maddie has changed from a good girl to a bad girl. But the attraction is still there. He fights it for a while but finally gives in. A highly recommended book."
3,A few godd songs but...,This record isn't as good as i was expecting. Has a few good songs but there's something missing. You you don't like this kind of music this is not your record.
5,Wood and Wood strike gold once again.,"I think Wood and Wood have some of the most beautifully illustrated books around. And they have done it once again. This is a delightful book. The simple, rhymning text is wonderful for younger children and the detailed illustrations are a deight for older children and adults. It will quickly become a child's favorite. I just loved it!"
4,funny,King Bidggood's in the bath tub and he won't get out. The page calls out for help. The first to try to get the king out of the tub is the knight. He tells the king that it's time for battle. The king responds that they will battle in the tub today and sets out playing with some tub toys with the knight. The fun continues when the queen gives it a try when its time for supper. The king just eats in the tub. The duke gives it a try next by telling the king he wants to fish. The king says today they will fish in the tub. It gets even more crazy when the entire court come to a fancy ball in the tub! The page has had it and decides to pull the plug!I liked the illustrations in the book. There is a lot to look for and they are really funny!This is great to teach that even the littlest of people can have the biggest of ideas
5,"Great story, excellent illustrations! For the kid in ALL of us.","I was given this book as a gift at a book shower before my first child was born. It has quickly become a favorite by both parents and child alike. The story is simple - a king who won't leave the bathtub and a page that is puzzled on HOW to get him to do so - but the illustrations are AMAZING. Absolutely stunning work with so much detail. As my son ages, I think this will be one of his favorites simply so he can search for something new in the picture each time!"
5,Fun at bath time,All children enjoy having fun at bath time; to imagine a king having fun too is difficult. The king gets to do things that the children wish they could do. When he does it the children just laugh because they want to do it too.
5,We know what to do!,"King Bidgood's in the bath tub and he won't get out cries the page who knows what to do. The queen, the duke the knite and the court all try to get the king out of the bath tub. instead of helping the page, it makes more for for him. Until the page knows what to do, he pulls the plug, glub glub glub! The pictures are beautiful! You have to spend time looking at the pictures because they are so detailed. My so loves this book. It gose in our favorite pile."
5,Wonderful and entertaining,This is a fabulous book with wonderful lines for small children. My 4 1/2 year old is in love with this book. She laughs at how the king won't get out. She reads along with me and gets the funniest expressions when King Bidgood won't get out. It is a must read for young kids and their parents!
2,King Bidgood: A Tiny Tale,"First, to correct a mistake in the synopsis: the page saves the day, not the pig. Second, the book has very little storyline -- admittedly a common failing amongst children's picture books, but still an annoyance. I'd prefer The Great Quillow, The Terrible Eek, The Great Kapok Tree, or another work with better plot."
3,Wonderful book,I and my son found this book at the library and fell in love with it. The story itself is funny and original and the wonderful drawings by Don Wood make it so unique. Unfortunately when we bought this book on line- the new edition was very badly printed and part of the magic of the illustrations was gone. The graphics were blurry and colors were messed up. I would recommend to look for the first edition of this book- it would make a huge difference.
1,no copy,"I asked for a copy of the contract, and I have never received it or any other information about what it actually covers. I have always had a copy of any contract. This is absolutely unacceptable."
4,very comfy,"Very comfy shoes some of the best I have owned, I have them in both black and brown. the only drawback is that the bottoms are slippery so be careful until you rough up the soles."
3,Be careful... Very slippery!,"Whoever decided that these shoes needed a layer of felt or fabric on the soles made a very bad decision! While wearing these shoes, I almost fall each time I step on my tile floor, and I DID fall down the last 3 steps of a carpeted staircase. These shoes are very comfortable and look nice, but please be cautious when walking on slippery surfaces."
5,Very Comfortable Slippers,"These sandals are very comfortable, and I am very pleased. I now own two pairs, the black and the white."
2,Slippery soles...bruised bottoms!,"Don't BUY!!!!! These shoes are adorable but very dangerous. NO SOLES worth a dang! YOU WILL FALL IN THESE SHOES! AS AN ER NURSE, I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL LADIES THAT HAVE HURT THESELVES BADLY B/C OF THESE ROXY SHOES! ~~**~~BeWaRe~~**~~"
5,Sax On Broadway,"A beautiful album, done by several outstanding saxophonists, some of them deserving much further recognition. The tracks selected are perfect to be heard in a sunny and cozy afternoon, eventually in the car with the sun roof open, or else, by the fireside in the cold winter..."
4,"Pretty good, not salvatore but still entertaining","There are plenty of worse forgtten realms novels out there (Once Around The Realms anyone?) but regardless of what the other reviewer would have you believe this is not one of them. Its a fun series to read with a different culture and approach than most of the typical sword coast/waterdeep clones we see a lot of from tsr authors. I admire the courage it took to write something not all Realms readers would try out with open arms, and even though the story/writing isn't top notch all the time, let's ask ourselves how often is that the case with tsr books? Yet we still buy them anyways and read them because deep down we all know that if tsr wasn't around putting out semi-good/semi-weak books like this, who's going to- you the critical reader? Let me know when you all write the next tolkien, I'd love to read that too!"
3,Oxford Study Bible,The Oxford Study Bible: Revised English Bible with ApocryphaI am not a Theology student but need special help when in a Bible Study group or when preparing a program for a church women's group. I find this is not especially helpful. Maybe I need to try it a little longer to learn it fully.
1,don't buy it in paperback!!!,"This is a wonderful book to study the Bible with, but in paperback it is just about impossible to read, because it'a thick book that is not well made. The pages are very thin and the cover is flimsy so it's hard to find a particular section and once you find it, if you bend the cover to keep it open so you can read it, it creases the cover. I had this in hardcover and it was wonderful. I lent that copy to a friend. Big mistake."
3,Oxford Study Bible,"I find the text to be very much what I like, however, the print/paper is not easy to read."
2,It is not very handy.,"The print is not very vivid, and there is no index on the side, so it is hard for me to find chapter."
3,Nice stand i cant get base to work properly though,Its a good stand but my main problem s the bottom piece does not securely go in. Its not a huge problem as it is still steady and does its purpose but because of that minus 2 stars. For the price its a good deal and arrives quick.
4,Tough Pocket Watch,This a tough watch. I'm an Ironworker so Wrist watches don't last a month. This on is on a small chain and I clip it to my belt loop. The face is a bit hard to read in low light but other wise it's handy especially in total darkness with the LED light.
4,Toddlers Approve,My toddlers approve of the meals I have prepared from this great book. It is toddler approved at my house and the finished meals are quite healthy. We really enjoy almost every single recipe.Also recommended: Super Baby Food
5,Yummy for baby and us too!,"I just got this cookbook and already I have made quite a few recipes from it. My daughter loves them, and her mom and dad do too. They are easy to follow and well thought out. I really like this cookbook."
3,needs work,"This cookbook really does have a lot of good ideas but so far, I have found that the recipes mostly need work. If you're a good cook and can tweak recipes then this book offers a good starting point for ideas. I was disappointed to find that many of the recipes aren't focused as much on healthy as on tasty--i.e. too much butter and white flour. And the one recipe with whole wheat flour, primarily, is the pancake and as it is, the recipe is not correct. (Have to add quite a lot more milk than called for to have a proper pancake batter.) I think the issue is that the author tried to really simplify recipes to make them palatable to wee taste buds but the final product is recipes that need a fair amount of working out by the user."
2,No thanks . . .,"I was sadly disappointed with this cookbook for toddlers! It had nothing to do with my son's likes and dislikes. I found these recipes didn't work for me (and I am not a bad cook.) The mattar paneer was too soupy. The homemade rice cereal was too thick. The foil-baked chicken was not done at the prescribed time. And the banana cake was greasy and flat. I have found that cooking from other ""adult"" cookbooks works well for my toddler. I just adjust the ingredients if it calls for too much salt or is too spicy. No need to buy this cookbook!"
5,"Variety for your kids, fun recipes for you","What I love about this book is the array of foods the author uses. I love Anabel Karmel's cookbooks, but she suggests making the same boring foods for our kids. Baby Bistro is fun, flavorful, and the recipes are so easy! I wasn't having much luck getting my son to eat different flavors and textures after eating baby food and pureed foods. Now I make a fun recipe from this cookbook each day and he eats it. Not only does he eat the recipes, he hums while eating them. That's a good thing!Enjoy!"
3,Recipes are kind of obvious,This book didn't really bring anything new to the table for me. The recipes seemed somewhat obvious and weren't anything knew from any of the other toddler cookbooks I've read.
3,Do I have to write a title?,"I can't get past the reverb on Southern Harmony. I've played Southern Harmony several times, and even in the best of concert halls it has never sounded like that. It sounded like they were playing in a high school gym. It drove me nuts! Other than that, it's a good group. Way to go on recording good material!"
5,Very helpful,"This short book is intelligently laid out, with just the right amount of diagrams. The text is easy to follow, even for a beginner. I am in the middle of attempting to follow Howard Resh's advice, as of early October 2001. If he is correct, I could be enjoying my first harvest before November!..."
2,Reads right to left back to front,"The book is Ok, nothing life changing, but some helpful material. Be ready to return it if you get one printed backwards like I did, I suppose it fires a different part of my brain and I can credit it for that. Much about basic hydro and less about tomatoes, I could have lived without it."
3,very good info but may misleading,"i have read the book. I believe the writer is very expert in this field too.But, some lines worries me.e.g. from 10pm to 2pmreview: could it be 10am-2pm ? or 10pm-2am ??e.g. low light condition, to slow growth increase EC.review: no explanation found why. increase food?i hope he can get his expertees and knowledge available to public more clearly through clearer writing or an editor.my third book from him, is on the way to my mailbox. I hope the writing is better.HOPE"
1,Viewsonic VSATV26324-1W $600+ dollars,"This TV/flat panel monitor died right after the warranty ended. The only thing worse was calling the Viewsonic tech support. They were totally useless. Didn't even try to help with any trouble shooting. Would not point me to a schematic, or suggest known parts that fail all the time. They just kept saying look for a repairman in the yellow pages. You might want to consider a company with a good track record for tech support before purchasing your next flat panel."
1,Is this the real Patrice??,"I'm a huge fan of Patrice Rushen,and is hard for me to believe that this is the same artist of""Shout It Out"" or ""Straight From The Heart""This is one of the most banal, trite, tiresome smooth-jazz average production i've ever heard...Arrangiaments, instruments sound, songs (many hits classic useless covers like everybody in smoothjazz)are totally without creativeness...Maybe in 1997 she was taken by other projects rather than her own production."
3,not her best,syrupy rendition of other people's songs. not worthy of Patrice Rushen nor a good representation of her awesome skills.
1,memory foam pillow,"i just received this pillow, where is the warrenty, guarentee, i did not receive any paperwork, no receipt....package was damanged....so guess i am stuck with it.false advertising, there should be some paperwork!!!!"
1,hard as a rock,"this pillow is like sleeping on a brick, I thought it would have a little more give than it did. do not like at all"
2,travel pillow,"I used the pillow on a few car camping trips. I felt like it was too thin for comfort for sleeping, but it works well in a hammock. Nice price, but not the most comfortable for a 150 lb. person."
5,Travel Pillow,This is a perfect pillow for your lumbar. It is soft enough not to be annoying yet firm enough to keep my back from getting tired. Love it!
2,Garden Frog,"I wanted a croaking frog to place in the garden area. He's ok, but his croaking sounds nothing like a frog. Sounds pretty sick."
2,selfish,"I am looking at this book from a purely selfish viewpoint. Although it was interesting and I learned a lot more on Milne, the size of the print was so small I could only read about a chapter at a time. I am talking about a size 8 font. Very difficult and it made it much less enjoyable."
4,"Classics: and Guarnieri,more of a good old thing.","A first time classical listener, should buy this, if the listener truly wants to streach their personal potential; even if they do not want to give Guarnieri the time. He still is a Classic: MASTER."
3,Too bland,"I bought this CD just out of curiosity, having read a review in JAZZIZ. Unfortunately, it was regrettable. The reviewer said that all the tracks sounded too similar. he was right. Each track is good by itself, but all the tracks in the CD sound the same. I never listen to it anymore, so save yourself 15 bucks and give it a miss."
5,absolutely amazing,I cant really say much else about postman syndrome than what the other reviews have said but this cd changed my life. Every song is special and just wonderful. Everyone should take notes from this band becasue they are amazing and it brings me to tears just listening to them.GET THE CD!
4,Similar...but different,"Comparisons aside, this is an exceedindly interesting listen. Epic in proportions with songs grouped into chapters and at times melded seemlessly. I have decided that at this point those who are aware of this group/album need to band together in a grass roots movement to bring the postman syndrome to the masses.I can't believe I just wrote that as I am the type that has throw CD's out of the window as I heard them resounding out of peripheral cars. I am, in fact, a music snob and have no bones about it. But as I hear the innundation of lackluster, mundane, repetative bands penetrating the masses, I am frustrated with the notion that a band as talented and creative as the postman syndrome has only 14 reviews on amazon. Why should you have to search for this type of music?Anyway...off my soapbox and onto the next one!Bottomline: Fans of creative, interesting and emotional/heavy music Buy this album TODAY!"
5,Great classroom/small room system,"You couldn't want more!! It plays DVD's , CD's allows you to plug in all of your components (projector, laptop, vcr, computer) and everything works and is happy. The volume is JUST loud eneoug for a small (28X25) classroom and the system is small enough not to take up space. I wish I had bought one for myself. I look longingly at it in my classroom and want to do the ""dummy dance"" for passing up the chance to purchase!"
5,What was the most beautiful station in America,Very good book which takes into account the historical background of why Penn Station was built in the first place right through to its destruction. A tragic loss not only for New Yorkers but for America and this book describes it well.
3,"Based on the series ""The Master""","This was just a couple of the last episodes of the series. It was a very good series but it never lasted long on Television. However, if you really like Martial Arts action then this is one of those series you don't want to miss, if you can still find it on VHS."
3,An interesting video,I bought this video because I love the movie star Demi Moore and was very interested see the young Demi working in this vídeo. I like it very much.
3,"Okay, I guess","It says in the product review that you can measure both dry and wet ingredients. I would only use them for dry. They are still a nice gadget in the kitchen. They have a magnet on the back, so they are easy to grab. I wish they would have measured liquids better."
3,Not as good as I thought,"They are just ok. They really aren't as handy as I thought they would be. I find that sometimes the weight of the food will cause the pusher to go down, resulting in incorrect measurements. The first time I used them the liquids measured fine. The second time I used them for liquids it kept seeping through the bottom. This was just one of them. I have not used it for liquids since then but I do admit there may have been other factors on my end that caused the liquid to go through. I still use them and the magnetic bottom does come in handy. I think it is more useful when measuring more than one tablespoon of measurements than it is with measuring in cups. I would only recommend you buy these if you do a lot of small measurements. I do not recommend you throw away your old set. These are more like cute little back up cups. I wonder how often the other reviewers that gave them high ratings use them???"
5,Handy Scüps!,"The one thing that is not listed on the item description is the nifty magnet on the bottom of each scoop. I keep mine on the side of my oven hood when not in use. It is also handly to put the scoop on a metal surface (the stove, for instance) to keep your scoop in place while filling it."
2,"Worked at first, then started to leak","These are definitely handy. They are simple to clean and come apart and go together easily. Some of the other reviews say that you can't get water out, but I don't think they realized that they come apart. The magnets on the back are handy too. I just stick them on the fridge, and when I am measuring something that could spill, I just stick them to the stove and this stabilizes them for me. I like them a lot.Had to change the rating I gave these. Not long after I wrote the original review (above) they started leaking because the inner parts warped. They were useless and were thrown away. It is a nice concept, but they just don't last."
1,Stick to regular cups,"I thought this was a great idea....but when you wash them, the water doesn't drain out of the handle very well...you have to shake and shake and still let them sit in the disk rack for a while...that could have been avoided by designing in an opening in the handle. Not for me...."
1,Rip-off - Items in picture are not what is sent,What a mess! The candles were tealight candles that were chipped and the pieces and powder were all over everything. No bottle of oil... just small pixie stix like tubes (2). Incense cystals ...but I have no idea to use them. I have not opened the videos or CD... But I imagine they will be completely cheesy!! Save your money... skip this product!!
5,Late is Better Than Never,"My husband had never watched ""Mad Men"" until the middle of this season, but after the first two shows he was hooked. I gave him the Mad Men:Seasons 1-4 for his birthday in June. He plans to take the tapes on our beach vacation so after a fun day in the sun, he can be entertained nightly by "" Mad Men."""
1,Item not as described.,"Even though it cost a little bit more money, I ordered this as a ""boxed set"" per the description on Amazon, rather than ordering the dvds individually. This description is wrong, they are just the four separate dvds, not put together in any boxed format. What really stings is that you can order the four individually on here, FROM THE SAME SELLER, for less money. Don't order this, it's a scam."
1,Mad men Seasons 1-4,"Was very disappointed to receive this product in the mail clearly labelled ""mis-labelled from distributor"". This was not seasons 1-4 but Season 4, episodes 1-4 :( However, I did return and received credit in full for the item."
5,Mad Men Seasons 1-4 Blu-Ray,Great Blu-Ray set. Blast into past! Start at the beginning of the series and see what all of the hype is about.
3,damaged DVD,I have experienced blank screens at least 5 times during the show. It's kind of disappointing for the price I paid.
4,Mad Men seasons 1-4,"The movies are really great. I enjoy watching them over and over. If I happen to go to sleep during one, I can go back and watch it again."
5,Mad Men Seasons 1-4,The DVDs arrived promptly and in excellent new condition.Great!!! We enjoyed the first two episodes and were amazed at the amount of smoking in the fifties.
5,Great series,My whole family liked it. I just do recommend it.Looking for Seasons 5 & 6 to see it. Enjoy.
5,Still not through all the seasons,Deserves every award it's gotten! Looking forward to finishing up the series before the new one begins. It's worth watching!
2,artificial conan story?,"i think this is actually the worst conan-story i have read. the plot didn't grab me, seemed to artificial to me. melodramatic. so the rest seemed pretty dull to me too. i never really believed in this story, which was carried out in a dull way too. not much suspence"
1,Absolute Disgrace,"Perhaps one of the most poorly written books I own. The author should either get some new friends to inform him of his lack of writing talent, or he should be imprisoned for such an apathetic attempt at writing. On top of that, his ""Opening Price Prinicipal"" is a completely stolen method. Toby Crabel was one of the original co-creators of this technique. The information on this technique is better explained in ""The Ultimate Trading Guide"", ""Long Term Secrets to Short Term Trading"", and ""Professional Stock Trading"". Of course, if one can track down Crabel's book, then you have the original work which is very thorough. At then end of the book, he does have a rather paltry chapter on Fib ratios that can be found and better utilized in numerous other books. In summary, this book is poorly written, weakly paraphrased, and completey lacking of any original content."
1,Opening price principle or Fibonacci?,"The opening price principle could be written on one page. I have books on Fibs, I didn't need another. Give me a break!!!!!!!!"
1,Opening Price Principle: Best Kept Secret on Wall Street,"What a trader really needs is ""The Closing Price Principle"" for the current day, with is the Top Super Secret on Wall Street.

3,The Gift of Relaxation,"In spirit, this is a wonderful CD. The music is soothing and the instructions are very good for accomplishing the goal of the CD. Unfortunately I find the guy's voice so annoying I have given up listening to it. Sad because the intent of the CD is clearly present. It's just his voice that gets on my nerves, which kind of defeats the purpose."
1,Does not work,"The techniques on this CD do not work. I do not suggest you purchase it. I bought it, and nothing works. This is the second time I have submitted a review and I will keep on submitting if amazon keeps on filtering out negative reviews, and trying to create a false impression of this product. People need to know the truth!"
5,B/W Documentary Dedicated to Places - Highly Recommended,"The ambiguity of the places (Wales) as well as the identity of the people (Welsh), forms an opened question from this book. Things are sometimes changing at a pace, that is difficult to be observed from the superficial level. It could happen in various aspect, economically, culturally, politically. Coal, steel, slate industry was diminishing. People were starting to lead their new way of living.One interesting part of images (and even art) is its ambiguity. Suddenly, I think of my home, Hong Kong."
4,Great Book,"Very informative,this is the book for anyone wanting to gain a broader understanding of alternative health. Book arrive in great shape."
4,A great biography,"Outstandingly informative. Opens your eyes to the snob in the author - which we readers can forgive, if not for his loyal conversion to Catholicism, but for his unfailing wit he never fails to put to use."
3,Finially figured it out!!,"Agri-Fab 38-Inch Tow-Behind Lawn Sweeper #45-0331The instructions for assembly were very confusing...3 hours, 2 men and a women later...we referred to the picture to complete the project. The adjustment for the brushes is tedious and tends to pull the runners of grass to the top making it look like a shag rug. It will not pick up anything slightly moist, so you have mow let the cuttings dry then sweep. I have about a third of an acre, and while I chose the smaller unit for maneuverability, I do have to dump it approximately 6 times because as soon as the bottom of the hopper gets full the cuttings start falling out. I have VERY thick sod so the cut grass has no were to go, so even with the inconvenience of unhooking, storing, dumping and adjusting, the Sweeper beats the heck out of RAKING!! I am very anxious to see how well it does with leaves, because pretty soon, I will have plenty of them."
5,Bringing Up Boys,"In today's culture we need all the help we can get to raise our children. The Bringing Up Boys video series provides some much needed help. This particular book is intended to be used with watching the videos and in conjunction with the class. For more informative helpful reading, Dr Dobson's other book by the same title, should be purchased instead of the participant's guide."
2,A Well-Thought Yet Flawed Opinion,"Like most parents, I utilized Dr. Dobson's guide to raise my children in the best Christian manner possible. However, I see Dr. Dobson's views as naive, sheltered, and deeply lacking in a modern approach to childcare. Especially on the topics of homosexuality, his tone is one lacking in Christian compassion. This guide is fraught with traditionalist conservative overtones - it is not purely objectively Christian in nature. However, the guide can be a very rough blueprint for raising boys, but many more opinions should be used to create a well-rounded approach that will be most beneficial to your child."
1,The OEM Shop did not keep thier word!,"I ordered a black berry battery and didn't get it. After accusing me of not picking up the package, i was never aware it reached my town; I get a notice from post office every time i get a package. I was offered to get the battery reshipped for free if i didn't give a bad review. As soon as i did remove it they canceled to re-ship and i lost my money and time. i payed $27.00 for shipping on a battery worth $6.95 and didn't get my battery and lost my shipping money."
4,BB battery,Battery and back door received promptly after order. Battery was already 75% charged and charged quickly. Saved phone from having to be replaced by Sprintstore since they said they had no batteries for phone. Also made separate purchase from this vendor for charger which also received promptly
4,Very different and a lot of fun,"I have a sampler CD with Dirty Laundry and since I found this for a whopping penny plus shipping, I took a chance. Really glad that I did! 7th house has a great sound and switch back and forth between genres freely. I ended up liking Man from Amsterdam more than Dirty Laundry and many of the other tunes are extremely catchy. Muddy water is another good one and Psycho is just good fun!If I had paid full price, I wouldn't have been disappointed at all!"
3,"Fun reading, but adds nothing new","If you've read the works of Rosemary Sutcliff and Gillian Bradshaw, as well as perhaps Bradley's The Mists of Avalon, you've read this book only better done. The only element which Paxson adds to the Arthurian story is her greater understanding of Saxon culture and magic. She does a good job of basing her reconstruction on near-contemporary texts, and is an engaging, though not ""literary"", writer. I'd recommend her other books, but this one is only for Arthur fans who can stand to hear the same thing yet again."
3,"If you read Book I, you'll want to read this","I loved Book One (the Book of the Sword) so I was eager to read this one. My feeling about it was that it was a good follow-up to Book One, but on its own, not the book Book One was. If you like the first one (and it was great) you'll definitely want to read this one too. Maybe it's suffering from ""weak second act"" syndrome - I hope so, and that Books Three and Four fulfill the promise of the first book. Or that, when all four books are read, Book Two will fall into place and become better. Anyway, compared to most fantasy fiction and historical fantasies, even a weak second act by Diana Paxson is better than most other books!"
4,Manga Artists Vol 1,"Length:: 0:49 MinsThis is the first volume of The New Generation of Manga Artists featuring the Koh Kawarajima Portfolio which consist of two different artist. Kazuaki Kawashima and Hiroyuki Karashima who go by the joint pen name 'Koh Kawarajima'. The art obviously consist of various anime or manga series such as Gundam and The Big O. As for the art itself, the colors are bright and the images are crisp and the pages are nice and thick. Most of the images are of pretty girls but only one is nude but even then it's not full nudity. I like this art book.Now some words on the contents.Pages 2 through 64 are all full color with some being partialy on the page, some full page and then some on two full pages.Pages 65 through 73 are the artist sketchbook with some notes from the artists.Pages 74 through 77 are the artist comments for the artwork on pages 2 through 64.Page 78 has the credits.Page 79 has the artists profile.I recommend it."
5,Good buy,"Love it. Great art with some insight into the artists. Not a lot of how to, but more info on the why."
2,"Fun stories, but poorly bound","We purchased these books for our Star-Wars obsessed 4 year old boy. My wife and I enjoy reading the stories to him because they hold his interest, which allows us to keep the t.v. turned off. After a week of moderate use, the pages started falling out. We returned the first book we purchased and ordered a few more volumes in this series. Both the replacement book and the new volumes have the same problem with the pages falling out. If you intend on reading these books more than once, do not purchase them."
2,"story's fine, book itself is cheap","I gave this to my five year old for Christmas. I don't have any complaint against the story, I rather enjoyed it. I just feel that for a product that is obviously aimed at kids, they should have made it so it would last beyond two readings. This book fell into pieces (meaning the pages just fell out, and not just some, but the majority) with normal use in the first week. My kids are avid readers and know how to respect books, so that wasn't to blame. I tried to keep the pieces together for a little while but just gave up and recycled the thing.The binding is better on $.99 coloring books than on this."
3,Star Wars Clone Wars Adventures Vol 1,This book is in fair contidion in my opinion. Not good condition as I had ordered.
5,My son loves it.,"5 star review based on a single criterion: Does my 5 (now 6) year old son love it? Answer: Yes.Book consists of 3 separate stories. The graphics look like the animated series, so points for consistency. The book does fall apart in short order, as other reviewers note. But this is for my son, not me. If he doesn't care that the pages fall out and then I staple them together, then neither do I.Not sure why, but often it seems like the animated Clone Wars story line gets reviewed as if it were not just for kids, but for grown-ups, too. Maybe it's because the plot exposition that sets the context for the action is pitched above the heads of young kids. Or maybe it's just that older fans (like young ones) want as much Star/Clone Wars as they can get. Whatever the reason, to me, animated CW seems targeted just for kids. Judging (solely) by my son's response to it, it's a brilliant success."
3,"Fun, Quick Reads For STAR WARS Fans Of All Ages","Dark Horse's STAR WARS: CLONE WARS ADVENTURES doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel, but it does a good job of presenting quick, action-packed adventures set in the STAR WARS universe to younger readers, while remaining entertaining and enjoyable to older fans. The art follows the style of Cartoon Network's (Old....) Clone Wars mini-series, NOT the computer-generated look of the current series. Volume 1 features three stories, all very action-oriented, that would be perfect for younger readers....Older fans can probably take a pass, though. CLONE WARS ADVENTURES is fun for what it is, but older fans will have seen it all many times before."
2,poor quality book,"These comic books are great. My son will spend an hour at a time devouring them. He is only 5. The problem I have with them however, is that they are falling apart. At first I thought it was only the one book. We must have broken the spine or soemthing, but no. All of them are loosing their pages. Now I know my son is only five, but believe me when I say he is very careful with his books. He cherishes them. Theya re just made very poorly. We are so diappointed as we have to keep reorganizing the pages and figuring out hwere they belong. Expensive little books to have falling apart. Very disappointed."
5,Great product! Must buy!,"This product is NOT a cheap flimsy orange stick, I've used orange sticks that look like they could double as toothpicks - this is a high quality orange stick, it's stout, and their delivery was quick. I made a purchase that was separated into three different shipments. This shipped last, however arrived first, two days later - I have yet to receive the other shipments, three days later. I'm very impressed and will purchase more of these in the future!"
5,"I can see the sharp sting of honey, and I can taste the sunrise.","This past fall, my school did this show. We took it to state competition and won third place. It is such an amazing show. I played Clovis P. Eudy, and it's true what another customer said; that this show does bring the cast together. No part is less important than the next. LOVE IT!!!~My Fave Line~""Can't stand to hear the word of God?!?""I got to scream that @ Mother Hicks. I waited through the whole show for that line every time. lol"
3,Not very deep,I was hoping this book would go into more detail and explain the concepts of the tools for living. They are a collection of motivational and behavoir modification techniques and I was hoping I could find out more about them. The book was short and the treatment was light.
3,weight watchers,This is a great weight watchers book. Its the old program but the rules they have in the book can be used everyday in order to help you lose the weight. LIke a guidelines to follow.
1,An unfinished work...A mystery to me..,"This book is a fair attempt to desribe Ottoman Turkish history.I think it is worth reading as something you would do on a lazy weekend afternoon; however....... It has poor cohesion and is not finished...It only tells part of the story.. It made me ponder as an Askenazim( European Jew) that the State of Israel would never exist if the Ottomans were not defeated ny the British in 1919. Not enough ,and indeed little is mentioned of forced conversions of Spanish Jews to Islam,ransackings of synagogues and the forced taking of Jewish children to the Jennisaries..( The special military corps for infidels) Also...what about the crimes against the Christian peoples? Isn't that an important consideration in arriving at an accurate conclusion for someone that knows nothing about the history of the Levant?"
1,Uneven book with an agenda; look elsewhere for a history,"I read this book to gain a better understanding of Ottoman history, precursor to Turkey, and its treatment of its millets. Instead I was given a revisionist account of its history replete with glaring omissions, including the most significant (and shameful) event in Turkish history, namely the complete eradication and Genocide perpetrated against its subjects, including the Assyrians, Greeks, and of course the Armenians.Civilizations thousands of years older than the nomad Turks who came to subjugate them wiped out, and not a mention of it in the book. Shame on the author, no doubt he too is afraid of the Turkish government's reaction if he dares utter the truth."
5,My Apologies,"I must have been drunk when I wrote this book. There was no ""Ottoman Empire"". You have been cruelly deluded."
3,Lightweight but entertaining introduction to Ottoman History,"This is a somewhat impressionistic history of the Ottoman Empire and might make a good introduction for a reader new to the topic. It does have the significant advantage that the writer obviously likes Turkey and the Turks and that his enthusiasm for this wonderful nation is communicated itself through the page. This reviewer found the book pleasant and entertaining reading in its earlier sections but by the time one gets half way the style begins to irritate and one wishes for something more substantial. This said, the first-time visitor to Turkey would be well advised to pack this work in his luggage along with John Freely's ""Istanbul: The Imperial City"". The latter, as well as providing an excellent guide-section, has short but readable accounts of the reigns of every Sultan and of their Byzantine predecessors. As such it complements Mr.Goodwin's book excellently."
3,Lords of the Horizons,"Jason Goodwin has written an intriguing and in many ways melodic history of the Ottoman empire. The pages flow easily into one another full of delicious detail, and the personality and incongruity of Ottoman history come to life in the readers mind. But the book is by no means exhaustive. Goodwin's determination to write a work of literature means the history suffers. I finished it with little sense of the chronology of Ottoman history - more a confusing handful of pungent anecdotes that, while immensely entertaining, left me with a confused vision of the Empire. He also concentrates on the European empire, the Balkans especially - ignoring Egypt, Iraq and the eastern provinces - which is a visible gap in an Empire whose demise framed the modern Middle East. Nonetheless, his style makes the book a delightful gateway to the Ottoman Empire."
3,"Interesting subject, but poorly written","I was really looking forward to this book, but I have found it very difficult and annoying to read due to the author's strange style. The book really needs some good maps and better illustrations. The topic is interesting."
2,Definitely not your usual history,"As several reviewers have noted, this is not a conventional history. And while many readers apparently find this refreshing and rewarding, I find it extremely frustrating. There is little chronological coherence to the underlying ""narrative"" (such as it is) in this exceptionally selective retelling of Ottoman history. Events and facts are frequently introduced as if the reader has long been familiar with them, when, in fact, they may be entirely new to her. The book does give interesting insights to details of life, battle, etc. (to a degree), but I find it difficult to overvalue these when I can't really follow the underlying chain of events that make up the history of the Ottoman empire. For me, this was a bit incoherent; for others with greater knowledge of these matters, it may be quite refershing and enlightenting."
1,"Ottomans: too much, too anecdotal","I read the whole thing, but on reflection, I would have been better off putting it down as soon as I figured out how bad it was. The author knows his history decently well, but doens't form into much of a cohesive whole. Often times paragraphs would switch, one to the next, with nothing joining them in terms of thought. I've read alot about the region and this is just about the worst that I've read yet. It is at times entertaining with its little anecdotes, but that seems about all that the book rests on.dissapointed."
1,Bubbly skimming instead of telling a story,"Every time you think the author is finally going to tell a full story and help you to get to know the characters, you are sorely disappointed. The narrative flits along stopping nowhere to really tell the great stories that you sense are lurking in the history of this empire. To really get the goods, read instead A Short History of Byzantium by John Julius Norwich. The title is deceptively boring: this book is everything Lords of the Horizons was supposed to be. Reads like I, Claudius, but amazing non-fiction!"
3,Fair enough,"Have to give good credit for the labour put into. Thouh somebody with acedemic interests should go for Halil Inancik, Yasar Ocak, Gordlevskiy and the referances thereto."
2,Turn of phrase at the expense of clarity,"I am not sure if Ottoman history is inherently boring, or if it the fault of the author, but this is not exactly a captivating book.It seems the author is more interested in sounding verbose than writing compelling narrative. To be fair, Jason Goodwin turns a phrase better than most, but I felt more could have been done with the material he had to work with."
2,Enjoyable but Anecdotal; 2.5 Stars,"A well written but highly impressionistic work on the Ottoman Empire. While very roughly chronologically organized, this is hardly a conventional narrative history but rather a series of anecdotes on different aspects of Ottoman history. This book appears to be drawn from prior secondary works and mining of contemporary eyewitness accounts, mainly those of European visitors to the Ottoman Empire. Goodwin is a very good writer and many of the individual sections are quite enjoyable and generally informative but the lack of clear narrative structure and analysis are major deficiencies. To really enjoy this book, you'd really have to already know the basics of Ottoman history and a fair amount of European history. More a work of literature than history."
1,An incomprehensible mess...,"I think the author high and the editor out to lunch on this one. Mr. Goodwin has a tendancy to change time periods and subject matter every other sentence making this book a complete incomprehensible mess. His excessive use of commas and odd use of semi-colons only add to the confusion. There are paragraph-long sentences disjointedly rambling on-and-on via commas and semi-colons leaving one scratching their head as to what he's writing about. I have a nice bookcase full of history, political and travelogues but rent is high here in San Francisco so this one's going in the recycle bin."
2,Not a Traditional History,"This book has some interesting sections, but those looking for a more traditional history, either chronological or thematic, will be disappointed. I read the entire book and it is consistent throughout in reading more like a casual essay or a collection of thoughts, loosely structured around the chronology of the Ottoman Empire (the subtitle ""A History of the Ottoman Empire"" would better have been dropped). The specifics of historical events are often left out, making it difficult to investigate things further if one wished. Additionally, and a big sin in history works in my opinion, there were constant references to various regions and cities with extremely little in the way of historical maps to help the reader."
1,"A frustrating, short-lived read.","After about 100 pages, I put the book down -- regretting that I paid for it. I don't have a pithy, insightful review of the book. It was confusing and hard to follow. Others clearly enjoyed the style and it brings to mind the statement -- ""in matters of taste, one cannot argue."
2,"Great subject, great detail. Too bad he can't tell a story.","Having recently visited Istanbul, I was very curious about the Ottomans and delighted to see this book. At first I was impressed by the sheer wealth of detail and Goodman's ability to convey the spirit of the eras he described. But as the chapters dragged on, I was more and more put off the author's effete, veddy British, veddy blowsy style which seemed rather inconsiderate of the reader. In short, I got about 3/4 of the way through and abandoned ship. Goodman seems like a competent, erudite scholar. Too bad he can't tell a story, and too bad his editor was on vacation."
1,Journalists should not write history books,"If you want to learn about the Ottoman Empire there are many good, scholarly, tightly written, interesting books in english. This is not one of them. Goodwin just rambles along with no organization, no clear themes, etc. Journalists -- which I believe Goodwin must be -- should not write history. They just aren't organized or rigorous enough."
1,Mostly unintelligble.,"Long and badly structured sentences, unknown English and foreign words sprinkled about like acid rain, different eras mixed up and combined in unintelligable sequence, hasty and brief comments about the most important events in the Ottoman empire's history make this book a total waste of time. I, too, bought it after reading the Times review. I have found that the reviews of the NY Times are not as dependable as they used to be. If you want to learn about the Empire, buy another book."
2,History by anecdote.,"The book makes a good read, but it was also frustrating. The author manages to capture and bring to life many aspects of Ottoman history. However, he is loose with many facts, and flat wrong with many others. Not recommended as a first text on Ottoman history. But if you are already familiar with this area it makes a nice addition to your library."
1,Utterly unreadable,"I learned more about the Ottoman Empire in Mike Dash's ""Tulipomania"" than from this book.This is not a history but a free meditation about things Ottoman. If you know the history already, you might get some enjoyment out of the connections Goodwin makes. But if you want to learn about the history of the Ottoman Empire, this is the wrong book. (You cannot always trust the New York Times Book Review).To allow readers to callibrate my opinion: I think that Thomas Hugh's ""Conquest"" and his ""The Slave Trade"" are excellent history books."
1,Flashy; limited; journalistic; has done better in his time.,"Not a terribly serious book, rather a pot-boiler. Earlier works were much better. Anyone who wants a more serious approach, but equally well written, should try From the Holy Mountain, by William Dalrymple; or anything by Bernard Lewis."
1,What a nightmare.,"I've read a lot of historical books, but I gave up on this one at the midpoint. As far as I can tell, the author's sole intent is to show off. His prose is so flowery, convoluted, and pretentious as to be unintelligible. He is also an annoying namedropper. Often, he'll use five or six undefined and unreferenced foreign words, cities, names, rivers, tribes, people, etc. in one sentence, just, I assume, to make us feel ignorant. Mr. Goodwin, the point isn't to flaunt what YOU know, it's to teach us about your subject in language WE can understand. What a peacock this guy is, and what a miserable read he's given us. Sad. Such a great topic, too..."
3,Not really a history,"Ottoman history is fascinating and extremely difficult to grasp. For one thing the chronology is difficult and my grasp of history is Eurocentric and Ottoman history doesn't fit easily. And the Sultans are unfamiliar. This book is interesting in the way it presents the Ottoman Empire. There is no real ordering of events. The author jumps from time to time and back again. It becomes difficult to insert it into a European framework, and that frame is quite important as the Ottomans interfaced with Europe constantly throughout their history. The book does give a feel for the place. It would help to be British to understand the book. The authors idiom and sentance structure are definitely not US reader friendly."
3,"Well written, but obviously slanted","As I finished up reading this latest book from Jason Goodwin, I felt that the author spent too much time attempting to glorify the past deeds of the Ottoman Empire and not enough time on the Empire's misdeeds, such as the extermination of Armenians during World War I. As a matter of fact, there was barely a mention of this act of genocide.At the same time much detail was put into other critical events that changed the Ottoman Empire, such as the Siege of Vienna in 1683. The passages describing this series of events were very well written and memorable.Jason Goodwin is obviously slanted and revisionist in his writings on the Ottoman Empire, but no more so than any Western historians have been for the last 200 years. This book is just another example of why people should question what they read."
2,Don't waste Your Money On This Garbage.........,"This is a book poorly composed and full of ant-Christian Propaganda...There is no other way to describe it. Potential readers are better advised to read Julius Norwich..He is Neutral and objective, looking at all sides of the issues cocerned...."
2,disappointing,"I started this book with curiosity, and put it down in frustration less than 100 pages later. The author seems to have put more energy into precious turns of phrase than coherent explanations. There is little sense of the historical interaction of the diverse people, cultures, and forces that made up the empire. There is a fair amount of detail about battles and military tactics (which I admit don't interest me much), and much conjecture about what the emperors might have been thinking.In contrast, I just finished Karen Armstrong's ""The Battle for God"", which I found to be clearly written and insightful about its chosen subject, and a very satisfying read."
1,"Shallow, superficial, lightweight; a big disappointment.","What a disappointment! Having just read with enormous pleasure Norwich's work on Byzantium, I was relishing a continuation on the Ottoman empire. Unfortunately, this is not the book!. The title is misleading: it is not a history; maybe an ""essay"", or ""thoughts"". It lacks structure. One somehow has the nagging feeling that one is reading a novel, and you wonder how deeply it has been researched, as it is hard to dig one's teeth into anything of substance. I find it hard to distinguish fact from the author's imagination. Furthermore, there is only one very general map, which is inexcusable: how can you follow the action?I'm afraid I dropped it after the first five chapters and have ordered Kinross's book on the same subject. Wish me better luck!If you have a serious interest in the history of the Ottomans, I definitely don't recommend this one."
2,The Ottomans in Hollywood,"I found Lords of the Horizon an overall interesting book but simplistic and monolithic in its approach. I think it is full of well concealed sterotypes about the Near Eastern culture of the Ottoman Empire and expresses an inability to grasp the complexity of it. The Empires decline started with European Enlightement. When the Christian peoples of the Balkans gained self consciousness as part of the European tradition, the Turks did not have a choice. They would either become assimilated by the Great Powers or develop nationalism. They chose the latter."
3,Haze On The Horizon,"This was a disappointing read. I had heard so much hype about this book that I was really looking forward to it and assumed it would be a 5 star production. Alas, it was not to be. The book is not well organized. It jumps around through time and space so much that you don't get the feeling that you are reading something coherent and substantial. There are also too many anecdotes thrown in that are presented as factual but seem to me to have a tall-tale quality to them. You start to wonder what is true and what is not. Fortunately, here and there are bits that are interesting and well-written, which is why I am giving the book 3 stars. 2 such highlights are the sieges of Constantinople and Vienna by the Ottomans in 1453 and 1683, respectively. These sections have a nice narrative flow and are exciting to read. I only wish that I could have said the same for the rest of this book...."
2,Impressionist history of the Ottoman Empire,"As with many modern English books of history, this one is nicely written but fails in what I assume to be the key purpose of a survey history: to tell us what happened and the context for it. We get a lot of both in this book but they are combined in an impresionistic flow. Events in three different centuries are addressed in the same paragraph which gives context but forecloses any chronological progression. In other sections, events are described in detail but with little context. Mr. Goodwin also assumes a great deal of knowledge on the part of the reader. As one of the very many who know little of the Empire, I felt constantly behind the curve, much like I would attending a graduate lecture on the topic. I would take something away, and might enjoy the presentation, but much of what I heard would be lost.And it has no good maps."
1,The author assumes too much about the reader's knowledge,"Our book club (12 people) chose this book, based on a glowing NYTimes Book Review and a desire to learn about the region and its history. Much to our collective dismay, the author's concern for a dramatic plot line overshadowed his obligation to inform. The only way for any of us to understand the book was to consult an encyclopedia, atlas, and unabrigdged dictionary with foreign terms. His choice of illustrations was also odd--ink drawings of individuals, when many of his discussions centered on architecture. This book club has been together for 10 years--this is the only book none of us liked!"
4,Content not as exciting as the titile,"As I first started to read this book, I did not like it. It was simple, no detail and did not follow a timeline. However, once I got further on, I began to enjoy the book for what it is. It is very easy reading and I learned a few things (mostly triva and minor details). I think the type of person who would most enjoy this book is someone who knows a little about the subject, but does not crave specifics and detail. If you don't know much about the Ottoman Empire, start with ""The Ottoman Centuries"" by Lord Kinross.The worst part about the book is the way it skips around from topic to topic and event to event."
1,Disappointing,"If you are looking for a book that teaches you something about the Ottoman empire, look somewhere else. The information in this book is unorganized, highly impressionistic, and obtuse. If you like reading books written by British professors with a paternalistic superior attitude, this one might be for you."
2,"Good anecdotal, but needs editing","I agree with the other negative reviews. I also wish to add that the glossary was very weak, and the one map in the book was not sufficient. He mentions many cities and a maps would help. A minimum about slavery and other negatives. Did evoke many pictures and moods of the empire. Much too sketchy and poorly organzied. Needs an editor or a rewrite."
1,Surprised it's in print,"Ceremony, the reviewer below, did a good job on this book. It is very disappointing. My thought while reading it was I was surprised it was in print. I was looking for a nonacademic history of the Ottoman Empire, sort of like the book that's described in the editorial blurbs above, that would be enjoyable to read and a good introduction to the subject. Instead, it's pretty much as ceremony described it. What was most irritating was the prose, which is maddeningly difficult to follow, know-it-all and filled with pointlessly arcane allusions. GO ELSEWHERE."
2,Seductive revisionist history,"""Lords of the Horizons"" succeeds on its own casual, journalistic level and that's enough for some readers, even academics, but its not good history. The work does nothing responsible to slow mounting popular opinion of the Ottoman Empire as some kind of noble underdog with a manifest destiny against the hegemony of western christianity, but rather encourages such corny thinking. I suppose one should dare not argue against such successes as theirs for sounding bitter and the fame and success of the Ottomans is what is celebrated in this book--a rather romantic sentiment for our day, no?"
1,Does not work with newer netgear FVS318 VPN router,"Purchased this because it was supposed to work with the Netgear FVS318 VPN router. Got it, it didn't work, found out that this software is version 8, and that it will only work with the older router firmware 1.4. Firmware 1.4 will only load on the older FVS318 routers (serial numbers starting with FVS8). Had to return it and get the Netgear VPN software which is version 10. If you have the older router and downgrade the firmware, this may work for you."
2,"way, way to smooth",Please do yourself a favour and get Laid Back instead of this! It is a far superior recording in every imagineable way. This was a real disappointment after enjoying Laid Back so much. I mean Chariots of Fire? Are you kidding? The syrup was oozing from the cd..
3,Cool,I purchased CD to try and expand my jazz collection. I was a little familiar with this particular artist. I was very pleased with the purchase price of item. This was listed as like new; the CD itself was in good condition. I was a little disappointed that it did not arrive in original package and was received in case that was used and generic. I normally like to read cover to get more info on artist. This particular CD is somewhat dated and may explain why it was not received in the original package. I was impressed with the arrival time of item; a couple of days after ordering. Overall everything else was Cool!
5,IT'S *ROCKIN* COUNTRY,"This song collection will appeal to all types of music fans. I typically tell people I am not a country music lover (my husband is) but I love this CD. From the get-moving tunes like ""Red Hot"" and ""Are Ya Gonna Stay"" to soft sounds of ""Mayfield"" to the fun ""Gadget Box"", it's all around great music for every mood. Seeing this band perform live is the best!"
3,Fizzy comedy.,"A broad comedy that is as sweet and fizzy as soda pop. Not something on which to base your film diet, but a fun addition.Chow Yun-Fat plays the richest man in Hong Kong who is not pleased with the arranged marriage with a shallow socialite which awaits him in just a few weeks. Leaving behind everything on a whim, he journeys out into the world and gets a job as a bus boy at a noodle restaurant and finds the girl of his dreams.Not much plot, but some funny scenes and Chow Yun-Fat has rarely looked cuter. A good candidate for rental; probably not a movie you'll want to see over and over.Be sure to look for CYF in a small role as Stink the taxi driver. One of the highlights of the film, especially since this was one job which Chow actually had before he became a superstar."
5,Brand New!,"Haven't started to read it yet but it arrived and it was not used but brand new. Yay!!Thanks for quick ship, 2."
4,Off on an adventure,"Tahir Shah wearies of London and its safe banality. He finally convinces his pregnant wife to buy a disaster of a mansion in Morocco and relocate there with their young daughter.From the beginning, their adventure feels doomed. Cats are found hanging by ropes from trees, strangled. The next door neighbor is the mysterious head of the Casablanca Mafia. Renovation efforts are led by a team of workers who can't seem to complete anything. Everyone seems to believe in diabolical jinns, spirits who live in the mansion and who appear to want the family to abandon the house.Banality starts looking better and better to Tahir.Mysterious and surprising."
4,Nice look at Morocco in a fun way!,This is a quick and easy read that gives a good look at life in Morocco in a fun way. The author does a great job of continually raising the level of ridiculousness of what he is going through.
5,My Kind of Travel Book!,"I like books where the author lives among the people and tells of everyday living. I've never been a fan of those that describe sites and restaurants.This is GREAT! Shah leaves clouds, stress and pseudo friends in England. He admits his naivete in moving to Casablanca and buying a Caliph's house. He has no idea that the legal system might not protect his ownership, or that the people he hires might be controlled by jinns/spirits.We learn about daily life and real people through his narrative.For those who like this style of travel book, Seth Faison gives us an equally good (but not as humorous) treatment of China in South of the Clouds.I hope Shah gives us an update! I'd like to see some photos, and learn more about his grandfather (as he learns more), his wife and Kamal and how his children progress in this new environment."
5,Fun,"Great for a summer read, this is a fun book that had me laughing out loud as Shah shares the trials and tribulations of living abroad, in a country that is both charming and mysterious. His characters are lively and memorable, and he has a wonderful sense of humor that never stops or sags. It's the best of the ""remodel a house in a foreign country and live to write a book about it"" genre I've read so far."
3,Funny and easy to read.,"After I read Under the Tuscan Sun, I yearned to visit Italy. After reading The Caliph's House, I'm thinking I'll steer clear of Casablanca. The author has an easy-to-read writing style, I'd be interested in reading some of his other travel books, however I'd steer clear of any unannounced visits to his 'jinn invested' home. Funny book."
5,The Caliph House,A worldly cultural experience which lifts you into another realm of existence outside of your own. I would like to know more about what the wife's experiences involve. Morocco is on my list of wish-list places to immerse myself.
3,I enjoyed it BUT...,"I'm new to the online reviewing but I did want to share a few thoughts on this book. I did like it, truly I did. However, I felt ""cheated"" in some ways when I finished it. I felt, throughout the book, that there was an underlying current of mystery in the identity of the Caliph. We never really even got to hear much about who he was at the end! Also, a bit of a ""follow up"", as it were, a wrap-up, of how things were and how people were currently would have been appreciated. I just felt as if it suddenly just ended and I wasn't expecting it, I didn't feel as if there was a conclusion coming.All the explanations into Moroccan culture and history were fantastic. I'm heading over to see about some of his other books if this was any indication!"
3,Good taste of Morocco,"I bought the book to get a taste of Morocco, since I'll travel there for a couple of weeks. It gives you a nice picture on how Morocco meets you and what to expect and I found it as interesting as the books written from Moroccan authors. Easy and hilarious but nothing more."
5,Great Read!,"I loved this book. In fact, I just ordered four of Shah's other books from Amazon. ""The Caliph's House"" was hilarious in parts, sobering in others (after reading it I don't think I will ever live in Morocco), and insightful on many of the differences between the Western/Christian and Middle Eastern/Muslim perspective. I love to travel and enjoy restoring old houses so the subject matter was well suited to my interests, but more than that, I feel I gained perhaps a glimpse into the Muslim way of thinking about their religion, family, relationships, business and beliefs. It is a fun read, well written and highly entertaining. I look forward to reading Shah's other books and have already loaned ""The Caliph's House"" to a friend."
4,Fun read,"If you are the adventurous type with an open mind to other cultures, this is a fun book to read. Tahir Shah describes his new home in Casablanca with dry wit and had me laughing out loud. I learned so much about a culture I knew nothing about, but it isn't a text book, or even travel type of read. The only question my book club members all had was, how did his wife not leave him during the very trying and hilarious remodeling project!"
5,"Funny stories, wonderful imagery",What a great book! I really enjoyed the humorous stories of his culture shock and misadventures restoring an old house. He described Morocco with such beautiful imagery. He is a fabulous writer.
5,Fleeing from safety,"Fleeing from safety and boredom in England Tahir Shah arrives in Morocco with his wife and children, their dream is to find a new life, away from sophisticated West. The immediate task is to rebuild and old palace in Casablanca to make a cosy home. Simple as it may seem, this process starts a nightmare: The only way to ever succeed is to plunge into Moroccan life and ways of getting things done, even taking into account Jinns demands. Layer after layer of Moroccan life has to be unravel and understood. With the aid of a deep rooted sense of humour and irony, Tahir begins the task and offers us some jewels: portraits of Moroccan life, sometimes ordinary life in the backstreets of Casablanca, sometimes strange cause and effect events; always touched by a sense of vivid reality. Alas, finally, to find himself as part of the landscape or design he initially fought.Fantastic reading."
5,"entertaining, clever, spiritually uplifting","This CD contains something a little different. It has musical stories told by a master story teller. If I Could Do Anything has a western flavor, but reaches out to everyone in a loving, nurturing, accepting way. It's charming and presents what it has to say in a totally entertaining manner."
1,"Don't waste your money, lousy camera....","Low quality pictures, lots of red eye and....the worst problem a digital camera can have....a LOOOOONG delay when you depress the shoot button."
3,not bad for point and shoot purposes,Although this camera is easy to use and result is pretty good but I found it a little hard to handle. Sometimes finger will come infront of the flash without you even noticing and causing a poor picture. If you tend to avoid that then be very careful as it may slip out of your hand.I found the flash is not very strong compared to my previous camera canon SD400. The camera doesnt have a zoom function when making video which I thought I wont need it but then later regretted it a bit.
2,Indoor pictures are bad,"The good thing about this camera is that it has got the cool looks. I was buying it for my parents and the first impression was very good. But when we used it, the day time pictures were just okay and night time pics were very bad. Red eye is horrible even after enabling the feature.The screen is big and useful but again, for indoors, the display is very grainy.Going to return it today. Suggestions - Do not buy unless return policy is good."
5,my beautiful song camera,i loved it it came before it is time in a great condition just as was described every things included i can not ask for more i highly recommended for any person want something nice and not expensive.thank you so much i will definately order fro them again
4,This camera was worth replacing,I lost this camera on a recent trip after having it for about 5 years. It's served me well and produced lots of great shots. So when I lost it I immediately sought to replace it rather than go for a new model. Glad I was able to find an exact replacement at a reasonable cost. The only thing missing now is the leather case that came with my original one. I highly recommend this Sony cybershot.
2,It's cute - but that's it,LCD screen became blur after 3 months of use. Can never take a good picture in door. Red eye reduction function is just for fun.I don't give it 1 star because it's still usable outdoor.
4,Sony Cybershot DSCT5 5.1MP,"Except for the poor night vision the camera is perfect, resonable price. It's real slim, you can keep in pocket, clarity is cool, good battary (upto 110 min). I am happy. But again you won't get good picture in night, red eye is big prob. I give 4.5 rating."
3,Great Pictures but broke down soon,"I bought this camera five months ago.. and the results were amazing.. The shots taken at 3 Mp were outstanding in day light and quite good in dark.. but after 5 months i started getting error message ""Lens closed"" even after opening it.. and i had to send it to service center.. one of my friend also bought the same camera and his camera started giving same error only after 2 months.. Even though it is a great camera.. you may have to go through the pain of service."
1,Terrible Image Stabilization,The shape and style of the camera is awesome. However I got quite dissappointed when I saw the picture quality. I am a big fan of Sony and prefer Sony whenever possible but it seems they could not make it on this one. Most of the pictures come out blur and you have to try real hard to hold it extremely stable so that the picture will come out clear. On a car or for a moving shot do not even waste your time to try to take pictures.At least try your chance on an advanced Sony camera but not this one.
1,DOES NOT WORK IN NIGTH,"Guys,This model does not work in the night. If you will try to take snaps in the night, you will get just a dark background only. Even if the object/human has full light in the night,dscT5 is not able to take snap.(Look at CNET for its reviews and comparision )Very poor battery life, last only for 1.5 to 2 hrs.Moreover in auto mode its take good picture, but if you customize your mode to night/beach or other mode it gives you shaky image.Works perfect fine in day light/specially in sunlight.Final work don't take this, rather go for some other model."
2,I wanted to like this camera!,I fell in love with the size and the sleek look of this camera but success with it has been extremely unpredictable. I never know when I'm going to get good photos. The delay is very long. There is obviously no stablization feature with this camera. If the lighting isn't just right and you do not hold perfectly still and your subject isn't completely inanimate - there is a high risk of a blurry photo. Oftentimes I check it in the viewer and it will seem okay - load onto computer and it will be just blurry enough to be unacceptable. Red-eye is a problem - I don't know why there is even a feature which is supposed to address this. I'm either going to go back to my SLR or purchase a new Canon with image stablizer.
4,A Solid Biography,"This work is a fairly standard, straight-forward biography of King Strang. It is very well researched, documented, and foot noted. It would appear that Mr. Van Noord dug deeper into his reseach than most authors dealing with James Strang have in the past. The book enlightened me on several points regarding King Strang that I had previously read and Mr. Van Noord found to be incorrect. If you are interested in learning about a fascinating man and those around him this is the book. However it gives only a sparce and very typical Beaver Island history and does not touch on the legendary (and I believe, mythical) Mormon, Beaver Island treasure at all. If those items are your points of interest, look elsewhere."
5,Wonderful Children's Story,This is an outstanding children's book from my childhood. I can remember it being read on Captain Kangaroo. It has great illistrations and add to the story's delight.Milton is a great dane (dog) who has wandered away and no one can find him. His owner has looked high and low. It is a sweet story about family and losing something very special. And most of all it is a story of new life and love. If I tell anymore I will spoil the story. (don't worry Milton is found and is just fine.)It is a hard to find book but well worth the search. I enjoyed sharing something from my childhood with my own child.
5,A Lovely Devotional,"I gave this as a gift to a friend who introduced me to the life of St. Rita. My friend has many books on the Saint, so I was delighted to learn that she did not yet have this one. It is a lovely little devotional that explains a bit of her life as well as each of the prayers for the 15 weeks leading up to her Feast Day-May, 22nd. The back has a mass for St. Rita-who is known as the Saint to pray to during times that feel Impossible. Her life bears witness to this and I feel comfort each time I think of her. Wonderful little book for yourself or as a gift."
3,ok,"I guess the bulb is ok. My only objection is that it is made in China. Delivery was quick and in good shape. Congress should stay out of private enterprise and business. Lawyers, Ha!"
5,Myu Myu,"I really like this game. It is awesome, but I am still stuck at Zoniha's place. This is a good game, but very difficult to win if you only have a com Pommy. Also look on Bombermania.com to find what type of Pommys are good before evolving Pommy. MYU!"
4,Fun enough if you can make it to the save point.,"Man, Bomberman Attack just wasn't that fun for me, at the end of the day. You had to finish the entire world before saving. I realized, as I was rather dreading to start it up again, that I just did not have to. I have enough games that if that particular game is not my thing I can just not play it. I love Mario, and Pac-Man along with Bomberman but I have a limit. Sometimes my fingers just cannot move fast enough to stop dieing. So when I started Bomberman Attack I realized early on that I could only go to a certain point without getting any better; that point didn't have a save area.I really enjoyed what I could play, so it made me rather sad to have to put it away for good."
3,Very good,"I love this game. Problem is there aren't many stages in it. But still I would say this game has about 16 hours in it. If you like to hunt for body parts it'll be longer tho so... that's a good thing. There's also a lot of different type of bombs in this game like the shadow bomb which you'll get at the semi final worlds. Just like the other Bomberman games there is a wide variety of enemies which I like about it... Despite it's shortness this game is still worth it, trust me cause I am not a fan of short games myself either."
4,good,I like bomberman the second attack because it's a challenging game but whenever an enemy knocks B.M off a cliff my brother says things like:stupid game!But another neat thing is while your playing (adventer mode) normal mode you can play as pommy! so it's a good game.
5,Bomberman's da BOMB!,"I think the best thing about this game is having Pommy(your sidekick) be second player. This game is vere challenging and has very mysterious charecters(like Lilith). It has 12 bosses and nine absolutely huge levels ( especially level 9). the second level was a real tougie but the boss was easy. The last boss the Angel(Creator of the Universe) is very very hard. (An easier way to beat the game is to die while battling Lilith, and there will be a sad ending and an easier boss.)If you do the easy boss Lilith dies(goodbye Bomberman's future marrige).Bombermans bombs are very cool especially the shadow bomb. Regulus the snow level boss from Bomberman 64 is back and he wants revenge as a strong fighter, Bulzeeb. The multi player is the best and becomes the bestest if you have a memory card. I recommand it to everyone."
5,Must have!,"This is a wonderful ""bible"" for anyone interested in purchasing a puppy, especially if they're considering a new breed. Great guidelines for what to ask a breeder and what to do once you take your puppy home. Also invaluable to educate your veterinarian about a breed he or she may have little experience with. Dog and reader friendly."
3,"For me, good but...","I've had this machine for three years and it work just fine. My problem is the remote craps out, so far I have gone through 3 remotes. The buttons stop working and the face plate falls apart."
1,Be Careful!!!!!!,Be careful when you buy this product!!! It does not have built in battery. We bought because we wanted a DVD that can play also Vcd when we received I realized that it does not have built in battery. I had to go and buy external one for $50. Thus it is not worth the money that you spend.
5,Quaint and adorable,Even the cover of this book is great. Chock full of sayings and blessings. A wonderful companion for an Irish wedding. Some of the sayings would make great conversation pieces when placed on place cards!!!
2,How much is this book worth?,"Very disappointed. This is a book with 87 pages and some poorly drawn illustrations. All for the low, low price of$53.00 including shipping!!!!!! What was I thinking? Not feeing as blessed as the seller is right now!"
3,Cleaning it makes it not worth using,I was very disappointed that this is so hard to clean using Calphalon's selected cleaning methods. I have to seriously consider whether I have the physical strength to do the scrubbing required to clean it so that it will be able to be used again without residue building up.
3,"Good grill marks, BUT messy cleanup","I purchased this hard anodized (NOTE: NOT non-stick] Grill Set, but returned it within a week. It did a good job searing grill marks into fish, chicken, and a steak, BUT it was a pain in the neck to cleanup afterwards (about 20-25 minutes). Those ""lovely"" grill ridges that left the grill marks make this piece difficult to clean. I just purchased a All-Clad LTD non-stick 12"" round grill instead. (at a local department store. . .special price item). I also looked at the Calphalon Profession Non-stick II version of this pan... but I did not like the Profession Non-stick handle. . .and hey, for the SAME price I got the ""All-Clad"" name.NOTE: Even Consumer Report rates this Calphalon hard-anodized (NOT non-stick) 11"" square grill as a good in leaving grill marks, but they also noted the clean up issues that I encountered too.If you get THIS piece, you'll get nice sear marks in your meat. . .just be prepared to stock up on Scotch pads and Comet as well."
1,Impossible Clean-Up,"I bought this pan at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $50 and was extremely disappointed by it's performance. If you like to marinate your meats, be careful - this pan LOVES to smoke - and burn. For me, even giving meats enough time to cook still made it stick to the pan. And I do cook with olive oil. Seems like there's a lot this pan doesn't like you to use (marinades, sauces, olive oil). Cleanup? Impossible. After a few uses, it got harder and harder to clean - even with DAYS of soaking it with hot water. I was so frustrated, I wound up throwing the pan out."
3,Grill Pan,"Great for grilling (dig those authentic grill marks!), but such a pain to clean because it's not nonstick! You will need to buy scrubbing pads to clean it after soaking it in hot soapy water."
2,Rehash and Speculation,"There are a number of wonderful photographs included in this book, but I think that the author at times dares to presume dialogue and events which may be less than accurate than eye witnessed accounts. It's not quite trash, but then again, it is not quite THE biography of Mr. Kennedy."
3,More like the life of JFK Jr ...,"An ok read with just a few snipets of new news. I did appreciate the center black and white photographs. The shots of the famous central park fight, there are photos here I had not seen before and that brought a tear to my eye. There seems to be a real emotional and deep love between John and Caroline. You walk away feeling like these are just real normal people with the same issues we all face.I believe the author was respecting what little privacy this family has by not going into more details, however much of the book is already common knowledge.The book is about the prince of the most loved american family, his trials and tribulations and the ultimate ending of his life that arrived shockingly and all to soon."
1,A shameless exercise in exploitation,"Christopher Andersen seems to have found his niche writing wildly speculative and ultimately laughable books about people famous for either marrying or being related to other famous people who die in accidents and have entire issues of PEOPLE magazine devoted to them afterwards. Let's be honest here--John Kennedy Jr.'s position in this world was strictly an accident of birth and genetics. Nothing against him personally, and it's always a tragedy when a person dies before their time no matter what the circumstance, but enough already!"
2,Much about nothing,"It is a sad tragedy that JFK, jr. died. No question. But he like all Kennedys put himself at risk. He was at best an inexperienced pilot who should not have been in that plane at that time of day. He put his wife and sister in law at risk with him.This is a book about a guy who was unimportant to his country, contributed nothing except being born well and handsome, who was not a good pilot, but certainly it seems a good guy. A sad tale, yes; his friends and family will miss him. But the country will hardly be a worse place."
2,Nothing new or in-depth,"This book has very little meat to it. The author didn't have interviews with any family members and makes do with oft-quoted friends. You get no real insight into the relationship between John and Carolyn. It reads like a clip job. The only interesting info was that John had public fights with other girlfriends too, makes me wonder if he had a problem with his temper or just liked causing a scene."
2,Get a grip.,"No matter how well written, this book would be essentially fluff. This is a democratic republic, not a monarchy. JFK Sr. was not a king. Junior was not a prince. He was little more than a wealthy celebrity, having more in common with Hollywood actors than with people who have some importance in society. Those of you who wept when ""Di"" died may love this book. The rest of you (those who have a life) should pass on the book."
2,Not worth the time or effort,"The book, to me, was just a shabby biography with two small sections at the beginning of the book and another at the end that gave a slight overview of the plane trip and subsequent crash.Save yourself time and find a book by a more reputable source."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"I have a room full of books, and this may be the worst one I've ever bought. For one thing, it is not about ""the day John died."" It is about the years he lived. For another, there is not one thing original in this book. Anderson simply read every other book about the Kennedys and lifted the passages that pertained to John -- in many cases, almost word for word. It is badly written and filled with careless errors (such as referring to John as ""Jack"" and confusing Carolyn with Caroline, etc.) Maybe 10 pages in the whole book deal with the day John died, and the reader finds nothing there that hasn't already been reported in the press. I will NEVER buy another Christopher Anderson book again."
4,Solid review of JFK Jr. and his legacy,"This book does a great job of capturing not only who JFK Jr. was, but also the impact he had on our nation. Special focus is given to the events that led to the demise of him, his wife, and his wife's sister.Solid writing and beautiful, relevant pictures help us to both remember and reflect on an individual who although left us too early, left a impact as a good man, son, brother, and husband."
3,Coulda been better!,"I think the book was inappropriately named. We get a small section up front about the fatal flight and then it goes into John's childhood for awhile. I think we all know his childhood. I just feel the book could've been more fact than assumption. How does anyone know what was said or done by these people if it also says they were alone. It's kind of like the old saying...if a tree fell in the forest and no one was around would it make a sound? Some things we just don't know and shouldn't assume. The cover is nice as are the picture inserts. I don't think it will be a huge hit...people are losing interest in volumes written postmortem I think....too many assumptions and too much negativity! But we all have our opinions. Overall a good read, it's a keeper."
2,The Day John Died,"I was very disappointed by this book. The title is misleading. It should have ben called JFK Jr.: His Life because that is what the book is. One chapter is devoted to the day/week he died. The rest of the book is information that has been printed hundreds of times. The author should have interviewed more people like coast guard etc. Also, Carolyn and the Bessettes were almost totally ignored. There was nothing about her childhood or any quotes from her family. This book contains too many assumptions about their marriage and last days together. I mean, how does the author know that John came home from the hotel and took a shower? He doesn't and neither do we, but books like this give a false reading of people lives. I do not believe this book. Maybe I would if the author had better sources."
2,A New Cover on Old Info,"Though I greatly enjoyed the author's work in ""Jackie after Jack"" this current tome left me somewhat disappointed. The bulk of the book seems to review the life of JFK sr. which led me to believe much of the current book was culled from previous works and simply reformatted to take advantage of the promo possibilities associated with releasing the book on the one year anniversary of JFK Jr.'s death. This is all so unfortunate because I believe the author is gifted and has proven his ability in previous books. Though I did enjoy portions of the book, it was light on the actual events surrounding the plane crash (interviews with Coast Guard officials who participated, etc.)"
1,Enough Already!,"This is nothing more than an unedited magazine article between boards. It isn't even about the day John Jr. died. It's a rehash of everything previously written. The bibliography could be The National Enquirer,People,and Page Six. Send your $20 to charity instead."
2,So So,"Well, it is good fiction. I suppose there will be a few dozen of these books coming out. The bottom line is that nobody REALLY knows the story behind John and his wife, etc. I still am in shock that the man died! I just can't seem to believe it and maybe that is why we buy books like this one."
1,Book,Neverr received it thanks to Storm Sandy. My cottage and mailbox were badly damaged. Mailbox missing since. x x x
3,Highly British,"I think the book is great and is certainly entertaining, but it translates poorly for an American.Each chapter is a different trip to a game. The stories are interesting enough but I know very little about the specific region so I had trouble remembering what teams are where. The author does little to describe the different regions and the teams for that matter. Very choppy and difficult to understand with an American mind, but could be worth a read if you love soccer."
2,nurse-midwifery student,I found this text to be overpriced for a generally uninformative book. If you have had to take A&P at any point in time in your life you will recall more information than this text can provide. I did not find it useful and wish that I would have simply trusted my old A&P texts. An A&P coloring book or anything would have been more helpful. The text is however nice in the fact that it is directed to mid-level practitioners. Don't waist your money.
2,bad service from ezonics,I have a new ezonics camera and i cant get it to work with my new computer. I think the problem is with windows xp and the service from ezonics has been very poor to get the problem resolved.
2,promised tech support is a lie,"All the features seem good and work well at first, but their site promises tech support in most cases in 24 hours and that's not happening. They have never answered any of the 5 msgs I've sent. I bought this camera based on reviews here. At first it seemed good (both still and video), but as used it for distant subjects I found the still picture is not very sharp (typical of CMOS imagers) and the video stopped working entirely. There's no H/W uninstall, there's no device listed in the system, so you can't get it out to reinstall it easily unless possibly uninstalling the whole S/W suite gets the camera out as well. 4 requests for tech support have been ignored as has a message to customer service."
1,Don't buy this!,"A true piece of .... I was initially delighted with this cam...most everything about it worked. I did have some problems with the software, as far as transfering pics from the camera to my computer. I eventually figured out that the software would only recognize the camera when it was instructed to search for a scanner, instead of a camera. No big deal. However, after having not used it as a digital cam for several months, I found to my great frustration that it simply stopped functioning as a digital camera. Tech support was no help. So now, I'm stuck with a webcam, instead of the duel web/digital cam I thought I'd purchased. Don't waste your time with this product."
2,Not what I expected at all!!!,"I thought the Ezonics EZDual Cam was going to be a great product, but it was not what I expected. The installing of the drivers and software was pretty easy. The software it brought for editing pictures is not very user-friendly and doesn't run very smoothly. I was not happy with the quality of the photos it took nor the quality of the video. The video had a huge delay, you could look at the camera and back at your monitor and you would still be looking at yourself. Plus, every movement is blurred. Forget about moving around!!! As for using it as a camera, not good at all. Again,, blurred!! Whatever you are taking a picture of better be super still and you better put the camera on a tripod because any little movement and the picture comes out blurred. I mainly wanted the camera to take pictures to email to my family, but as bad as the pictures come out, its best to use a regular camera and just scan them.. Very cheap quality!!"
1,Not Satisfied at all.,"I found this camera to be totally unusable. The company did not replyto my requests for help. The Software installed ok, although notparticularly intuitive, it worked. The problem was the picture was completely blurred. None of the settings on the focus ring made it any different. All in all, a very cheaply made product...Thanks for nothing...Worthless."
5,exactly what it says,"if you want to know what the green berets go through to get the tab, watch this video. its graphic and raw. it will make you realize just how easy waking up in the morning actually is. you get to see the emotion and physical stages these men go through in their 2 week training program. some will receive it and some will not, but they all emerge as brothers. buy this and you will be impressed."
5,This is a wonderful product. I'm in law ...,"This is a wonderful product. I'm in law enforcement, and some days when I get home from work, I'm tired and worn out and can't have peaceful rest due to muscle tightness and the stress of the day. I've been suffering from these problems for some time. After the first night of taking these herbs, I rested more peacefully. When I awoke, I felt refreshed and ready for the next day. I was very pleased and impressed by the quality and effectiveness of this product. I'd recommend it to anyone who's having difficulty getting a peaceful night's rest."
4,"Smells horrid, but works...","Yes, I have to agree with everyone else here, these pills smell absolutely horrid, but I tried them last night, and I did get a noticably better sleep, I just felt more refreshed.Update: I've been taking two a night, as the bottle suggests, and I am getting a more rested sleep. It's been a week now, and I don't really notice the smell of the pills now either. Good stuff. Celestial Seasons also makes a tea with Valerian, so if you don't like pills, perhaps try that."
3,I expected this product to work better than ...,"I expected this product to work better than it did. I'm a very light sleeper and I'd hoped this would give me a better, more refreshing night's sleep, but I really didn't notice a difference on the nights that I took it."
3,I found Valerian taken in the evening about ...,"I found Valerian taken in the evening about an hour before bedtime to be a fairly effective aid for relaxation and better sleep. When using this product, I didn't experience lying awake and waiting for sleep to finally come. For this reason I'd consider using the product again. The thing I didn't like about it is that I found the capsules to have an extremely unpleasant odor, which almost put me off of trying them at all. If there were a better way to make these capsules in order to mask the odor, I'd be much happier with them."
4,"I was really excited to try this product, ...","I was really excited to try this product, which is supposed to promote good sleep. I've frequently had problems with sleeping, some nights only sleeping two hours. The first time I opened the bottle, I couldn't stand the smell. But I took two capsules. Didn't do anything. It took a week before I could tell a difference. I think that now they're helping. I've mentioned these to co-workers and I'm hoping they continue to work for me. I still hate the smell."
5,"After taking Valerian, I began feeling drowsy and ...","After taking Valerian, I began feeling drowsy and soon was sound asleep. I awoke feeling refreshed, and didn't have any groggy feelings at all. Valerian didn't cause any side effects for me, either. I've tried this product several times and have been pleased with the results each time. I'd recommend it highly."
2,"Maybe it's just me but, the product seems ...","Maybe it's just me but, the product seems to have a backwards affect on me. It kept me awake more than it helped me to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this product for someone trying to get some sleep."
3,This product helped me to relax in the ...,"This product helped me to relax in the evenings when I took it at dinnertime and made it easier for me to slow down from the coffee-filled day. I was also able to go to sleep earlier and more easily. I don't know if it was a placebo effect or if the pill really helped, but I felt better the days that I took it. I'd definitely continue to use it when I'm feeling over stressed or wired from a busy day. It worked better than chamomile tea for me. I'd recommend people try it if their doctor says it won't interfere with any other medications they may be taking."
4,Nice and interesting book,"Interesting book, nice pictures, comprehensive, well worth the money. Haven't compared to other books in the field so my judgement is not 100%."
2,"Great Ideas, if you teach at the university level!","I am a going to school to become a high/middle school health teacher. I am trying to build my professional library and came across this book. School Health Teachers Beware, this book is for those who work in health education at the college level. I found few lessons that could be adapted to fit HS/MS. This could be interesting and helpful info, if your students are college Freshmen."
3,I honestly can't say anything good or bad ...,I honestly can't say anything good or bad about this product. I didn't notice any difference taking it.
2,I noticed very little difference with my energy ...,"I noticed very little difference with my energy level or my physical well being. I was discouraged by the fact that I had to take two capsules three times a day. The dosage of the two capsules should have been combined so that less capsules would need to be taken, fewer times a day. Overall, I noticed very little difference."
3,I didn't notice any noticeable difference after using ...,I didn't notice any noticeable difference after using it.
5,15th Anniversary Present Found!,"The item purchased was in great shape. The shipping box was banged up, which was ironic since the box had FRAGILE all over it.My wife was pleased with the present, and so am I!"
2,Oversized!,"Received a size 2 thinking it would fit as most 2s do- no, extremely oversized 2 means size 5. As far as quality goes, it did the job."
5,Such a Smart Idea,I had so much fun reading this book that I handed it out as presents at a dinner party I just gave. All my friends who were there thought it was so clever and easy to read. Much better than doggie bags. I thought it was not only fun to read but didn't make me feel stupid for not knowing all that stuff.
1,Disappointing,The long-winded history dissertations might appeal to certain history buffs but the average party person would get bored with the dry details and find someone else to talk with. I didn't find any practical information in the book. Does anyone want to buy it from me?
3,It's alright,"I saw them on GMA and wanted the book because of their ideas. Basically, it's a history/trivia book. Not really an easy read. I guess I thought it was going to be set up differently, instead it's like a chapter book."
2,FUNNY?,"Really disappointing, there are some interesting facts but the attempt at humor is really distracting. I really didn't expect Dennis Miller but not anything this tedious."
5,Love the Book,I loved the actual knowledge and history combined with the humor. Great writing style. Really enjoyed the book. Going to give it as hostess gifts this holiday!
5,Funny AND Informative?,"I wouldn't have thought you could give a thing like this 5 stars -- but it deserves it! It's as if Dennis Miller wrote entries for the Encyclopedia Britannica. Some of the names & events in here I'd barely heard of -- but when you read each chapter, you realize this was one seriously important person/event in the world -- how is it possible I didn't know these details?! Actually, this book is funnier than Dennis Miller (because not as snarky), and it really made me feel like my college education was inadequate -- but it shored up those Smartness Gaps and made me laugh out loud as it did. Plus, a forward by Mike Nelson from Mystery Science Theater?! You can't lose. Buy it and put it someplace in your house where every so often you'll pick it up and read a chapter."
5,Excellent Resource,"I found this book to be an enjoyable, fun, informative and ready reference for any novice to important historical subjects.Also, all of the other subjects covered were done in such a fun, light and memorable way i am certain i will use this book when i find myself in social situations outside of my element.I highly recommend this book to everyone because, even if you don't need to improve your social skills, it is a spirited and enjoyable read. Highly recommend!"
5,You need this book!,"I kept picking this book up when I saw it on display in a bookstore. Now I have it. It'll make you laugh and make you think... sometimes of how stupid you sound, sometimes how smart you seem. Pick it up for yourself, for your socially inept friends, or just for the hell of it. You'll be glad you did."
5,Fantastic Fun,"Hilarious! For everyone who wants to sound smart... but not at the cost of being funny... this is the book for you. Tongue in cheek, yet REALLY useful. A great and fun read."
5,Perfect for my time whenst praising the pocelain gods,"I am enjoying the book immensely. Covering topics from the obscure to the worldly and worthy, it's worth the time. Certainly a fantastic crapper book, which in my and the world of many other young men who park themselves on toilets 1/2hour at a time, is a high endorsement.I look forward to spin offs!"
3,Little different then expected but delivered what was promised,"The item didn't really look like the photo used and while this wasn't a big deal, the item did arrive a day late or so. Its a little different then I expected with its features and appearance but it still delivered what was promised so I am happy I was able to purchase this."
4,A blast from the past!,"The price was higher than I thought I would ever pay, but watching these episodes and remembering how much I love this show made it worth it. DVDs all work well and the condition was great."
1,Too Many DVD Versions = Confusion!,"I was looking to buy my 9-yr-old daughter the complete Sailor Moon series, starting with the very first ""origin"" episode of Sailor Moon. Turns out that when I bought this DVD from another Amazon seller that it was for the third series...and in Japanese too with annoying subtitles! Arrgghh!! There seems to be so many versions of this series on DVD that I think I'm giving up on Sailor Moon. Too confusing to me which DVD I'm looking for. Pity too - I think my daughter really would've liked this show..."
1,listen to the basher,"yeah that guy's review is harsh but folks, this is crap. the show is repetitive, the charachters are annoying,it's just not an anime worth your time"
1,The Britney Spears of Anime,"Over the time that I've wasted viewing this garbage, it's perfectly suitable to call Sailor Moon the Britney Spears of anime--both are overhyped pieces of crap with no depth and meaningless dialogue. But at least Britney Spears is pretty, whereas Usagi has gigantic eyes that bulge out of her brainless head. If you want to buy something that's actually decent, buy Cardcaptor Sakura or Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne, because they are the TRUE Queens of the Mahou Shoujo genre."
4,"Great plot, but Serena's voice actor is horrible","I really loved this season of Sailor Moon. My only complaint is that Linda Ballentyne, who was Serena's voice actor, was terrible. Serena didn't sound like Serena at all...I had no problem when Tracy and Terri did her voice for season 1 and season 2. But the plot was terrific, and at least the voices of the other sailor scouts didn't change too much. I gave this 4 stars because the storyline made up for Serena's voice most of the time. I also love Sailors Uranus and Neptune."
2,Sailor Moon S Boxed DVD Set,"I was very surprised at the total price I had paid for this. Also I was disappointed that the user had sent it via ups when I had commented that standard mail would apply. The dvd set was a good $300 with taxes then I had to pay $100 for shipping... I paid $400 for this dvd set. I am a big fan of Sailor Moon but I think for the price I paid for one season... I think that I should have the entire series on dvds for this outrageous price.Considering the price... I am happy with the product although I dont find much special features. I dont care much anyway, I love this season of Sailor Moon"
5,"She is the one, Sailor Moon!",I love sailor moon. She is a great role model for young girls and I hated the fact that they stopped airing it on Cartoon Network.
5,Need help!,"I have the first two seasons of Sailor Moon in the box sets and am having a hard time finding seasons 3, 4 and is 5 out yet? I used to shop for them by typing ""Sailor Moon Season 1"" and that's how I got the first two. Are seasons 3 and 4 under different names (like S, Super S)? What are they called? Thanks for any help."
5,I love This soo MuCh,This is one awesome anime and the dvd box set rules so hard!! This is the season where pluto and neptune come out. I love those 2!!! if you are a sm fan u will buy this!
5,Brilliant,I just love Sailor Moon. I have tons of collectible items. I can't find any toys though. I always got up at 6:00a.m. to watch it. I even nearly missed an episode because the clocks went forward and I ended up watching it at 7:00a.m. on fox kids plus. I hated fox kids for not airing it so I entered loads of comps to win video's/dvd's and have told my parents I want video's from Amazon or E.Bay for my birthday. I'm Sailor Moons biggest fan.
1,hand held sports game Grand Slam Baseball,I was very disappointed with this toy. I purchased it for my 7 year old grandson and even I could not read the very small print. I disposed of this product. If it were possible I would not give this product any stars.
1,SAD BUT TRUE,I WAS LOOKING FOWARD TO THE USUAL ROCKIN JAZZY MUSIC AS IN FEEDING THE WHEEL.NOT SO HERE.I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS CD.ITS NOTHING LIKE FEEDING THE WHEEL.THE SAME GOES FOR AN EVENING WITH JOHN PETRUCCI & JORDAN RUDESS.I'M SORRY BUT NOT MY STYLE OF MUSIC.I'M LOOKING FOR RUDESS MORGENSTEIN PROJECT & I HOPE I'M NOT DISSAPPOINTED..
4,Perfect for dance...,"My mother, teaching a ballet class of 3 and 4 year olds, was set to the task of trying to find music for ""tightrope walkers,"" going along with the whole circus theme of the recital taking place in June. This CD was perfect, not just for her class, but also for three other teachers looking for songs! The songs are fun, funny, and adorable sounding, capturing the ""sounds of the circus"" in its many parts truly well."
5,Thanks,"My dad was in prison and this book helped me make it through the 8 years he was locked up. I love it so much, i'm going to get married and have a kid and then do something to get 4-6 in the pen and right before I start my time, present this book to my wife and child so that they can truly enjoy it as I did."
2,Only partially helps out,"Many of the subjects in this book were only lightly touched on. The more in depth areas weren't as helpful. For example, a whole chapter on ""why daddy sounds so much different when he passes gas"" and very little on ""The dishwasher always breaks after dinner, so the repairman comes by three nights a week."" All in all a basic book for the youngster who will soon be wetting his bed again."
4,Excellent Wok,"Great piece of cookware. I have a set of All Clad stainless I've slowly built up, but I still will pull out this wok for several cooking tasks. It is also one of my wife's favorite pans because it is lighter and this is the only wok type pan we own.The included accessories are actually helpful. I use the strainer all the time and the plastic tongs get use when we are using a non-stick.My Calphalon non-stick sauce pot has been scratched, just like every other non-stick item I have ever owned, but the wok with the Hard Anodized finish still looks pretty new after many years of use.The long handle and loop on the other end make carrying this wok as well as flip stirring far easier tasks.It is just a well designed wok and well thought out set of cooking tools. It is disappointing it is no longer available."
2,Not any better then the multi surface cleaner,Plus I don't like the scent as much. I don't get any of my cleaning products on Amazon. Why use something less versatile when it's specialty isn't any stronger then the more versatile one? Too expensive to buy on Amazon.
2,It just cleaned,It didn't really make any difference from regular cleaner. Not really impressed by it being wood cleaner. Don't make the wood look any different. Very disappointment.
4,Still weird...,"This series gets more and more out there with the partners and relationships, but it is definitely different then most out there."
5,A whole new Pack...Yay!,"This book introduces us to a whole new pack of Chanku! How fun!! That means lots more yummy alpha males to look forward to. :)I really enjoyed this book, maybe even more than the original. It leaves all kinds of openings for sequels (of which we know there are at least 4 more, not counting the Sexy Beast anthologies). The storyline is gripping, and all of the characters are compelling. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series."
3,Plenty of bite not enough sex,"I like my eroticism to be EROTIC, but Wolf Tales II, which promises to be a series of erotic adventures with a supernatural twist is only about on a par with the eroticism of daytime soaps. The hunk, Lucien, has potential, though and I hope Kate Douglas takes more risks next time out. I'll be back, though, so the actual writing is good enough to keep me interested."
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointing.........no where near as good as Wolf Tales. I found it extremely boring, even the erotic parts."
4,Part Human.....Part Wolf,I agree with a couple other readers....the stories are getting repetitious. The characters are different but the scenario is the same and you can pretty much figure out what is going to happen before it does. The stories are hot and enjoyable but I'm looking for something that changes the story up a bit....just a little.I do enjoy the series and will read book 3...but might read a couple other books before getting into book 3.Worth your while to read.
1,Country of Origin on bulb and package conflict,"While the package says ""Made in USA"", the bulbs are labeled ""Korea"". There are lots of other types of bulbs, it would be better to get ones where at least the package and bulbs match."
1,lousy hose,"This hose is prone to kinking in several places, as you might expect from a 150 ft. hose. That's o.k., but what isn't is that it developed a large hole at the point of one of the kinks that made the hose useless. This was after 4 weeks of ""operation."""
4,Missing set screw,"If you're going to buy the jig you need this accessory kit so that you can drill the holes. However, there are two set screws involved and of course they are different metric sizes. And of course one was missing. And of course when I called to get a replacement they sent me the wrong size. Since I live in the mountains with only a small hardware store locally it meant a trip to the big city to get the right metric set screw."
2,"5 stars, if ur a girl",I played for 20 min and i gave the game to my sis. Looked to me like a solid rpg but the music and the storyline is just for girls. Try ff7 or chrono cross instead.
4,Fun Irish music,"Golden Bough are a prolific group, with many recordings. Some of my favorites I obtained long ago, and are now out of print. This album focuses on Irish music -- flawless harmonies, good energy. Recommended."
5,a thoroughly scholarly and well-thought out work,"the author covered the subject of crime--from ""senseless killing"" to street crime--from the heretofore neglected perspective of the criminally minded, psycho-sensual, culturally deviant psychological/ego needs of the perpetrators. the approach was scholarly and well reasoned and left much to ponder--particularly as we struggle to make sense of the next ""senseless killing"" we are confronted with."
4,A little short but definitely worth it,"For the price that you can get for this movie I would definitely check it out. Carol Burnett is at her beautiful best as Dorothy Benson, housewife and want-to-be-writer who moves her strangely normal family to the suburbs of New York. Of course she gets to meet all of the neighbors, deal with her hubby (Charles Grodin) who's obsessed with the lawn (thus the name of the movie), her kids' crazy schedules, and her friends who use her as a sacrifice for cookie sales and parties. Different but sweet anybody who likes the brilliant Burnett has to check into ""The Grass Is Always Greener Over the Septic Tank."" For the $5.00, it's worth it."
3,Dawning: The next great move of God,"This is a prophetic age, and the writer has tried to give us an insight as to what God mind is towards us. God 's word is all we need to change our lives. But man is very far from God's will, so God will still continue to speak to us. I recommend this book for all especially unbelievers."
4,Photo Inaccurate,"Nothing wrong with the hurdle, it's just I was looking for a set of simple, cheap, adjustable hurdleS for personal use. There's 4 in the photo and the product description didn't say that there's only one (not that is said there's 4 either).Hindsight is 20/20... the product title says ""hurdle"" and not ""hurdles."" Oh well, I'm left with a simple cheap adjustable hurdle that's also sturdy and safe. Really challenging when set at the 42"" height! I'll keep this one but I'm still debating whether or not to buy 2 or 3 more. Would be 5 stars if I hadn't been burned by the photo or if it were a bit cheaper."
5,Perfect for plyo,"These are well made, easy to adjust, and look like they will hold up well. I was looking for an economical, adjustable hurdle for my kids to use for plyometric and agility exercises. These work great."
4,Pet Steps,"They are smaller and not as sturdy as I expected, but they are put together fairly easily and they are good enough for a small dog."
3,Pet Steps,The picture looks better than what you actually get...... none of my cats will use them cause the covering does not lock tight against the steps
1,I was fooled.,"I bought this for my 17 year old cat. I heard such great things about this product. I know the name says doggy in it, but I even inquired as to it being used for cats also. Therefore I did not buy this product blindly. I was fooled these steps are nothing but a cheap piece of plastic with a fake piece of sheepskin to put over. I am returning this item and caution others who are thinking of buying it, especially with an older pet."
5,Crazy,"You look at all the reviews, and everybody is either from Canada, or somewhere along the border, like Pensylvania. I live in California. Everybody down here has never heard of Finger 11. That's a shame. They cd stores don't even carry finger's stuff. I suppose eventually, finger 11 will make their way down here. I wish they'd hurry up. They sound like creed a little bit, and creed rules. You should get this cd. I like it."
5,This CD is Da Bomb!,"Well, I always liked Finger, but the other songs on this CD are great, too! I recommend this to anyone who likes rock music."
3,Finger Eleven Tips It All - most,"This is a great sounding and well put together cd. Sure it clashes with a bit of an Our Lady Peace style, but thats music. Finger Eleven is a great Cd, but in the long run, if you are looking for something extraordinary, wait for the Our Lady Peace album to be launched. Coming this fall."
5,Eleven out of Ten,"Every now again, if ever, an album is released which is so good you want to scream it from the highest mountain and tell everyone you meet about it.Well ""Tip"" by the sublime Finger Eleven is one of those albums.It is high in melody, passion, power and top songs. I have a pretty big music collection ranging from Nirvana to Radiohead to Metallica to Soundgarden and I can honestly say that ""Tip"" beats the lot of them.That is the biggest compliment I can pay the band, songs like Quicksand, Shudder, Above and Costume for a gutterball are simply stunning and every song on the album is good enough to be released as a single.I can't say anymore or else I will burst , just buy the album and give the guys the success they deserve."
4,What the hell happened to these guys?,"This is a really solid album, Finger Eleven's best. This album, along with ""The Greyest of Blue Skies"" are both albums that are worth buying. However, I don't know what happened to these guys. I can't stand their music now. In fact, I downright hate it. I wish they had stayed the way they were. I understand that artists grow, it's a part of keeping the art real. Sadly, it didn't work out well for F11.In regards to ""Tip"", you won't be disappointed. It's a well crafted, well written album from a band that has a lot of talent; but has since fallen down into the mud."
2,just another cd you can toss,"This was the finger eleven debut cd. this cd to me really only has 3 or 4 songs that good. This cd, like their 3rd and 4th cd are just overall not that good. the best finger eleven album is greyest of blue skies a must have for everyone. it is more experimental and darker but really hits home."
5,This album really rocks!,Been listening to it for 2 years now. I can't wait 'till they release their next one
5,Great Hard Rock,"This album is a great mix of new metal stylings and emotional alternative rock. ""Tip"" soars from deep end heavy riffs to sounding much like their fellow Canadians ""Our Lady Peace"" (check out Awake and Dreaming). If you are a fan of all types of rock music, this album will satisfy all of your cravings. Each song is as good as the next and is free of the turntables and cheesy gangsta lyrics that has become too popular in modern hard rock. This one is worth picking up."
5,EXCELLENT DEBUT,"after seeing the videos for tip and above i decided to purchase the cd and it just blew me away and stays in constant rotation of my collection.i just cant get tired of it plus i never skip any songs,this is one of those bands that definately deserve more praise and attention.also i can see small similarities between raine maida(olp) and scott andersons voice but thats just because the same guy produced both of them,but dont let that discourage you if youre not a fan of olp because scott sings with much more agression.anyways its a great debut from an amazing band-later"
4,More Info on this disc written by the artist!!!!,"I noticed this page has no info listed on the CD so I thought I would add some!!!On this CD I deal with subjects of the paranormal like dead ghosts who come back fromthe grave to haunt thier murdering lovers, Angry Indians who seek revenge on thosewho took their land, lost love and broken relationships!!!Track listing:1. He Died In the Flower Garden2. I'm really Missing You Baby3. UFOs in our skies4. I'm Stuck On Sunshine Hill5. He Got Him A Goth Girl [his side]6. The Angry Indian [Go!]7. I don't Want You Anymore8. Never Piss Her off [her side]9. The Cold Hard Yesterday [Autumn 89]Musical style: Grunge/Metal/Alternative Rock"
1,"Terrible, misguided, and off-topic","I was enthusiastic about finding a book dedicated to parrotlets; this book contains more information about other small hookbills (parakeets, hanging parrots, and fig parrots.) I had to weed out the information that actually pertains to parrotlets...isn't that supposed to be the book's subject?The book also fails to discuss the selection of a responsible breeder, nor does it mention questions to ask that breeder.If you are truly interested in learning about parrotlets themselves--NOT their cousins--, this book is a waste of your time and money. Save your money and find a reputable breeder who will give you in-depth information about THIS species, not a selection of like-sized birds."
2,Off Topic,"I bought this book hoping to find out more about parrotlet care, training and behavior. Instead, it reads like a mini0encyclopedia of all small parrots. Most of the parrots listed in this book are not even seen in pet stores. The author should SERIOUSLY think about revising this book OR changing the title."
3,"Good for beginners, But Not Enough In-Depth Information","I bought this book before I got my first parrotlet, and it really helped me learn the basics of parrotlet care. The basic information about feeding, caging, and personality was useful, and I really enjoyed the beautiful color photos. The information is all very general, though, and much of the book is devoted to overviews of various subspecies. That did help me pick out my bird, but now that I've had him for a few months, I really want more in-depth parrotlet-specific information. I want more about parrotlet character traits, training beyond the basics, and other topics."
3,Not Misleading,"I didn't buy this book I brought the newer version. Looking at the first chapter I didn't like the book but those of you saying the book is misleading, it says on the cover that it's about parrotlets and other dwarf parrotlets not just parrotlets"
5,The Parrotlet,This book is very informative on the parrotlet. I highly recommend it to someone needing information on the the smallest parrot of the species.
1,Not for this square,"This film has little value to it. A woman draws to other women to her house, then tortures them and uses them as her sex slavesThe 'torture' is under-played. The 'sex' is too, with no one taking off their underpants.It thus doesn't work as a horror movies, or as a sexy movie.What makes this film even worse are the laughable production values that are so poor we frequently see a boom-mike come into view, and you even get a shot of the camera-man, who's reflection in a mirror adds unintended humour to this poor work of a film."
2,Disturbing and confusing,"While the actresses are quite lovely the overall movie is horrific. Which I suppose it is supposed to be, but there is no flow to the story. I found myself more confused by the jagged transition from one scene to another then by the ""psychotic"" ramblings of the villan. Save your money.Rape Is a Circle"
1,Item is wrong,"Item is described as ""Heavy Duty Metal Cutting Wheel, 10-Pack"" but it is not a 10 pack, it is only 1 wheel."
3,Great Smokey Moutains,This book didn't have the specific information I was looking for ....that's one of the perils of buying over the web versus in person.
4,"Takes a while to take off, But it is worth the wait.","The one thing I liked about this book is the contrast in the two leads. One, an european sophisticate type, and the other a footloose american free spirit. The longing and lust building up througout the book is mesmerizing. Pure chemical reaction. The ending kind of runs out of steam as I would have like to have seen the two girls go off together. But all in all I was very satisfied with this book. For me Mindy Kaplan delivered the goods."
2,Not what I was looking for...,"The video is shot from the front with the dulcimer on an angle. I wish it had been shot over the shoulder so I could relate to what I was seeing.Dulcimer is not his primary instrument and I think that shows. He often plays with his thumb on the side of the sound box and under the dulcimer. He addresses the technique, saying it was mostly for video purposes, but again, I had trouble relating to it.That said, he knows his chords. He demonstrates C, D, D7, Dm, E, Em, F#, G, A, Am, B, Bm...bars and variations. I found it interesting, but I was looking for ways to pick up speed in jams...I don't see this video being helpful for that."
5,Excellent As Usual,Cephas & Wiggins speak to me where I live. I don't think they could put out a bad album if they tried! My two favorite songs on this album are STACK & THE DEVIL AND RAILROAD BILL. You can't ever go wrong by buying their music.These two are truly great Bluesmen. More power to them!
4,My 7 year old grandson likes this,My 7 year old grandson is really into basketball and he has watched this over and over again. The only downside is the segment showing Nash getting injured so many times and the injuries he sustains. It is too graphic. But the rest of the DVD is funny and entertaining. Many of the shots are unbelievable.
2,A little disapointed,Don't expect this book to be like her Brother Cadfael series. I bought this book because I have every Brother Cadfael book and wanted to expand my Ellis Peters/ Edith Pargeter collection. I found this book to have little to no character development and made large jumps in time that were akward to read.
1,A nightmare to clean.,"I have the Calphalon Commercial Nonstick cookware and as such, I cannot use a metal potato masher in the pots. I thought that this product would be the answer. However, the design is flawed. It does and OK job mashing the potatos, but the clean up is a nightmare. The holes are too small and the potato gets stuck in these openings. You practically need a toothbrush to get the residue out, your dishwasher will not. A much better choice is the Oxo non stick potato masher, it has open sides and is a breeze to clean, even in the dishwasher. My Calphalon potato masher has been sitting in a drawer taking up space since I purchased the Oxo."
3,Needed if you have non-stick pans,"I love my non-stick pans, but I felt that to properly maintain them I would need the plastic utensils. This is a useful potato masher when I want to mash tomatos while I am cooking, or other stovetop purposes. But, I found that I really need a stainless masher for all the other things I do off the stove (guacomole, baby food)It is not especially strong, but my biggest problem is that if I leave it on the stove too long, it begins to get soft. It's often a pain thinking about moving all my utensils away from the stove area when I'm cooking.Even at 8 dollars, if you have to replace it twice a year it's just not cost efficient. It's easier to pick up the cheaper ones at discount stores."
1,set this house on fire,I am still waiting to receive the book. The seller insists that I received it but has not re-sent it or refunded my money.
3,Very cute,Aww I loved my ducky charm and I had it for quite a while and it actually fell off after a year or so. I was sad to see it go. But cute while it lasted.
2,"An excellent advanced text, but lacking in explanation","Steinfeld's book is an excellent text for those who have a thorough background in Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics. However, for the introductory graduate level kinetics course or advanced undergraduate kinetics course, I would not recommend this text. Steinfeld does not illustrate any of the concepts with actual data or explanatory problems. Furthermore, the problems at the end of the chapter have very little to do with the material they are supposed to cover. Finally, there are many mistakes in this edition. They are mostly typos, but they add a lot of confusion to the materialI would recommend this book only to people who have a very complete background in kinetics and dynamics as a nice reference book."
2,Mistakes,This book was plagued with mistakes which made trusting it difficult and did not assist me when completing the assigned homework.
1,Worst Manual I've Ever Bought,"This manual is barely worth the paper it's written on. The photos are poor quality, writing incomplete, and it tries to cover too many models with a single book."
5,High Class Literature,"I have just read CRAZY STREAK and the dust and desolation of the setting, the desperation of the characters, the poignant, pitiful struggling for acknowledgement and love, sticks mercilessly to the reader, the test of high class literature. I am reminded of the film, East of Eden, updated and carried to wild extremes. CRAZY STREAK proves that outstanding literary novels are still being published in America. Excellent!"
5,Crazy Streak - A great book by John Gilmore,"I have been an avid fan of John Gilmore for many years and have read all his books. This latest one, Crazy Streak, is one of his very best and I can unreservedly recommend it. It details the adventures of a band of young people who drift in and out of one problem after another, surrounded by complexities and tensions of sex, lust, booze, jealousy, violence and sheer cussedness without seeming end. The characterizations are powerfully and sharply done and you can see each of them with vivid and distinct imagery. I would recommend you buy this book and enjoy!"
3,One word for this book: Sick,"I did not really enjoy this book. It felt as though I was reading something out of a soft porn magazine. The relationship between this older guy and young girl was a bit disturbing for me. A little girl having hot, unprotected sex in the front seat of a car was not my cup of tea. If you are however interested in that kind of stuff, go ahead and get the book."
2,keep looking,"I have read many books about the old west, and this one is not that informative. The story is hard to follow, it does not read like an actual first person narrative. It was common to fictionalize current events at the time to sell books(Dime novels for example) and newspapers, and Native Americans almost always got the short end. Yes, horrible things happened, but this book seems to go out of its way to demonize all Native Americans. Several events pop up here that are recorded nowhere else. This book just feels like poorly written fiction. The flow of the narrative is off, it just does not track with history. Definatley written by a third party."
2,A hard read for the American English,"Don't buy this book unless you have a good understanding of the way journals were written in that time. It is not for everybody. It is hard to keep track of where they are in the story, it jumps around too much and is written in religious code."
3,Hey! You're giving away the plot!,"The MST3K crew makes this...movie watchable. It's one of the worst movies they ever did. The movie, about 6 lovely women trying to stop kids from taking drugs, was made in the 70's. Good Cause, ladies.....but it makes a BAD movie."
4,Mst3k at it's jiggly best!,"Sort of a cheapie Charlie's Angels with slightly downsized babes? Yeah, that's it. ANGELS ranks as a very good episode. But according to Mike, Angels Revenge is simply ""the longest flashback ever"". For babe power I put it slightly below season 10's HORRORS OF SPIDER ISLAND (Not yet available on video). There's some truly classic riffs which may force you to stop the tape just to laugh at length. There's one point where I thought to myself how Jim Backus looked like a walking corpse. Shortly after this Crow says: ""This is the first movie Jim Backus did...after he died."" That was a tape-stopper for me!Aaron Spelling on a bad day? Yep, that's Angels Revenge!"
5,Another HR from MST3K,"This might be the worst movie MST3K's ever put a torch to. Manos, Red Zone, Beginning of the End, and some of the others look like exactly what they are. Bad movies made for no money by hacks. This 70's jigglefest looks like someone actually thought this was a good idea. Plot? Basically, it's any given ""Charlie's Angels"" episode put on by a middle school acting class.That this abomination had real actors in it is incredible. You'll cringe at Jim Backus and Peter Lawford. And never let it be said that MST3K is without heart. You can actually hear Mike and the bots groan when Backus and Lawford make their embarassing appearances.Servo: Do you think Peter Lawford even knows where he is?All in all, the riffs were great. But as with many MST3K's, that doesn't always dull the pain."
4,Does the job,"We had this exact basket in steel and the food stuck horribly. After finally pitching it, I decided on this one hoping the nonstick would prove easier to clean. So far, its been wonderful.I do have to say that the handle is weird - the last handle snapped into place and made it easy to shake the basket. There is no shaking going on with this handle. Use a spatula to stir or flip the food."
3,Not exactly what I wanted,"This Basket is a good size.I am not a fan of the way the handle works. Two prongs fit into the squares of basket. The one my friend has (who received it as a gift), has a handle that slides on to two short posts that stick out from the basket area. A pushbutton releases the handle. His was a higher gauge steel wire,not coated with non stick.Personal opinions. I like it, though there is a better quality one out there. Just can't find it. Many people will like this product.These pro's and cons are only my personal preferencePros-- Great size for shrimp and veggies.Non-stickCons- Non-stick always scratches off after time. Not a good thingNeed heavier gauge wire. This one will not last as longHandle not secure enough for me.Photo is deceiving."
5,Charcoal Companion Non-Stick Grilling Basket,This basket is excellent for grilling vegetables and stir fry on the grill. The handle easily attaches and removes from the basket during cooking. It is easy to clean and maintain.
4,just what i wanted,I needed a basket to grill vegetables and asparagus. This one is very good quality. Fits the grill perfectly. Detachable handle works great.
1,HORRIBLE STICK,"DON""T BE FOOLED BY THE PRICE.(This Is Truly You Get What You Pay For) I have a small store that has carried this product in the past. That was untill we really put this Stick to the test. I gave a 15 year old drummer 5 pairs of the OAK 2B for 1 practice and 10 Sticks did not Last more than 30 Minute. With a combination of Sticks breaking and Tips coming off we have decided to Trash the remainder of our Inventory which was not much.Being a drummer of 30 years I could not beleive the Tips coming off. This is probably a result of some China Company using CHEAP glue or hardly any glue at all. I have never seen such Junk in my Life. Good Luck. My reccomendation is stay clear of this product.Jim Garcia"
3,"Decent, but be careful about claims that it is ""HI-FI""","They advertise this VCR as ""4 HEAD HI-FI"". This is NOT the case and thank heavens that Amazon does not do the same.I kept this item for a few weeks and then returned it, partly because it was false-advertised, but also because it contributed a little distortion to my audio system when I cranked up the volume a little bit.Also, the LED display on the front tilted to one side, which didn't give me confidence in how it was constructed.I know...it's a cheap VCR with nice features. But it's poorly built, feels ultra cheap, and does not have ""HI-FI"" Stereo sound like other VCR's in its price range do. But if you really want VCR+ and commercial skip, go for it. I opted for a Sony model in the end."
2,Piece of junk,"I bought this VCR in 2/02. Within 1 month, it stopped recording audio but continued recording video. I had it repaired at a RCA service center and all was fine with that for about a year. Then the same problem. RCA refuses to help since it is out of warranty even though it is exactly the same problem which occurred before.Also, the commercial advance is very moody. It works when it feels like it and doesn't when it doesn't want to."
1,Not 40mm,"Packaging from manufacturer even states ""40mm"". It was not. It clearly measured 35mm with my calipers, therefore it was useless for my hinge installation. Currently waiting on a new one to ship, thus holding this cabinet job up even further. I have no reason to believe the new one will be correct either."
3,Not bad for the money,"I'm a cabinet maker and needed a 40mm forstner for one project and picked up this one, it is relatively inexpensive. I found it similar to the CMT router bits I own: fairly good quality, but I don't rely on them for holding an edge. So for the occasional oddball job, they work fine. But for bits I use all the time, I'd consider consider another brand."
4,Gift,"I purchased this book as a gift for my wife's employer, He requested it and was very pleased on receiving it."
3,Civil War Sites,"Actually the book was a Christmas gift for a relative so I did not adequately review it. I know it was a good value as I saw it offeredin a mail catalog for about $2 more. The speedy, efficient service byAmazon was 5 star."
1,a rating in progress:not sure yet- but why am i not excited,"I am not sure yet and want to give the book a moreserious look. Perhaps my mistake was to buy thisbook at the same time i acquired Composite Drawing byUddin and Color Drawing by Doyle. The drawings and formatof these books instantly became well worn reference textsfor myself and students. I chose the Kasprisin book becauseit presented a medium missing from the other books: watercolor techniques. I will give the prose a serious trial and i hope the book eventually proves to be a good resource too.However, what bothers me is the book is sitting on my shelf and i am struck by the following realization: when it comes to a technique book, if i am not personally inspired by the sample drawings or paintings i am probably not going to be motivated to try to emulate the techniques. Please acknowledge this may be too shallow of a reaction and you may well find the book meets your needs."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"The price is right for this portable CD player, but it lacks the quality one might get for a few dollars more. The design itself is awkward. Loading the CD is a task unto itself, especially if you're using this in the car. The buttons range from being ultra-sensitive to being incredibly stubborn, which again does not make for ideal use in a car. Sound quality is mediocre; there seem to be glitches in the track reading every so often. Since I have only used this CD player in my car, I can not attest to the quality of the headphones, but I can't imagine they could take much abuse. If you're looking for a CD player that doesn't do much more than simply play the CD, and if you're not overly concerned about true sound quality, then you might consider this machine. You might want to consider, however, spending a few dollars more to get a more reliable, sturdy product."
5,Fantastic and intelligent resource book,"I found this text to be a totally informative and intelligent read. I am constantly using it as a reference book. It outlines organic living for the garden, family and home. Wonderful antedotes and tips on living an organic lifestyle in the everyday world grace the pages. Clear and concise writing together with inspiring photographs make this a great and colourful resouce."
3,llarochelle,This book has really good points i am a younger reader in early twenties and am trying to go organic. The book seems like it is for people who have alot of time. I have a full time job and go to school and the author in this book just doesnt make living organic practical. But dont get me wrong the book opened my eyes to how many harmful things we do to are bodies and our planet.
1,Never again will I buy something I have not seen first hand,"This lamp sucks. Ugly, horsey, the base is made of some material that attracts dust and hair that cannot be wiped off. It just looks much better in a pic than in person."
5,Incredible upcoming band,"I had the honor of booking these guys back in late 2004, and I was more than impressed, to say the least. Their formula, although not unlike most similar bands in the pop-punk genre, is very tight and incredibly catchy. They've swarmed so quickly to success that I imagine I couldn't even get in touch with them personally today, whereas just over a year ago, I was able to book them. That's a nice track record - and with good reason!"
4,Hi Action Low Fantasy,"Conan the Valorous takes the reader on a long journey with the barbarian back to his Cimmerian homeland. The story is packed with action along the way. Again, Roberts has created another character-driven story, where events unfold as the logical consequence of his characters' behaviors. This gives the story a nice feel and solid pace. Roberts also harnesses imagery into his stories more so than the other Conan pastiche writers. His imagery of mountainous Cimmeria and the lands he passes through along the way are often quite stunning. Roberts handled the affect that living in different lands would have on a Cimmerian once he returned to his brutal country. The author obviously gave a lot of thought to how Conan's adventures south would change him. On the down side, there are a few moments when Conan slips out of character and when the action gets a little corny. Overall, a solid story that you should enjoy."
1,Confirming NOT about couple rammed by tanker,"....Davis, Gordon Scott Leviathan, 1976: Oceanographer's son tries tosave the whales by sinking a Soviet whaling factory ship in theAntarctic with a midget sub, helicopter and other hi-tech toys he inherited from his dad.If you're seeking the other one, it may be: Scott, Justin The Shipkiller, 1978 (The story of a man whose sailboat was rammed by the largest tanker in the world. He lost his wife and swears that he is going to sink the ship. Will he make it ? The story takes you all over the world. A well documented fiction but not far from reality.)"
4,Very pleasing!,"Davis' amazing novel focusing around the common present day problem of preservation absolutely thrilled me. Though not for the young childern, or the weak of stomach, for that matter, it is a novel with amazing political correctness and description. While it doesn't get going right away, one can sense a certain... movement of plot thorughout the entire book. A solid book with a side for everyone. Of special intrest to animal rights believers!"
3,My Daughter's Favorite,"My Daughter is 5 and we've been reading this book for 2&1/2 years - Christmastime or not! Now I'm trying to find replacement stickers so that her brother, who's 2&1/2, can enjoy the book as well."
2,do its jobs but.........,"it's IMPOSSIBLE to take the ipod off.. and while you're trying to do it, you have to put REAL pressure in the hold button in the ipod and this can broke your baby... the front design in the case is a thin layer that peel of if you try too often to take out the ipod (often = 4 for times). you may say... why you want to take out the ipod of it's case? well.. because only the headphone jacks fits!!!! most of the other cables of other headphones or other equipments the case hole for it is just too small, thing that is frustating by the way.. that's why i hate this case.. and IS NOT THE SILICONE that you see in others cases.. is a hard palstic"
5,Buy this book!,"I got my ""crave on"" for more McKinney! Looking forward to book 2! A Lifetime of Vengeance was one of those books that read fast, you keep reading to know what happens next. Grisham and McGuire are my favorite authors and Grondin didn't disappoint me! I recommend this book!"
1,major disappointment,"I had no huge expectations for this vcr, given the pricepoint, but I did expect it to run more than 3 hours. Used it once, fine, put a tape in the next day, and no picture. I'll never buy another cheap vcr again. Designwise, both the case and remote were acceptable, but if it doesn't play, they're not much good."
1,Very Disappointed,"I agree w/meelisabeth.Couple of mths after I got it, I too couldn't see what I taped, fixed it and 3 mths later I have the same problem again!! So now will cost me to fix again.. Costing me alot for that thing..."
2,Boring,"My five year old loves Ben 10, but found this game boring. There is no real mental challege. The games rolls the dice for the player, you move a certain number of spaces, then perform a task. The task is unchallenging. The game is also long and difficult to win."
3,Not much fun!,I got this for my 7 yr old son who loves Ben10. But he didn't enjoy it much. I tried getting him to play it but he explained it doesn't do much. It's sort of like the games you get with the DVD movies. You have to play with your DVD remote (boring) click here and there. Overall it was a waste of money. I would not recommend it. I can't even give it away now! You're better off spending more on the actual nintendo game or x-box game.
5,Hot!,"This is the first contact with a new species, with the unique relationship between a talented woman and the intriguing alien. Sexy scenes and conflicts make this a very interesting reading, and make you want to read the whole series."
3,"Lionheart...a first book , reissue...","Though I love Kate Douglas' books, this is a first for me. Ms. Douglas put on FB that she was re-issusing her first story...Lionheart. I didn't have to think about it, I went to Amazon and purchaced it. The story was a good one, but not up to Ms. Douglas' standards of today. It was worth the moeny I spent, and I did enjoy the book. Will I read it again...good question. Will let you know..."
5,Cats Meow!,"This books is about an alein being that resembles a cat, his space ship crash lands on earth. He falls in loves with a human woman and the rest, well you will have to read it yourself, but don't waite this one is hot, hot, hot."
4,I just use pedometer,I can't say much about the book since I didnt read it. But the pedometer works really well.
1,It didn't work,I was so excited to get this in the mail and get started walking. Unfortunately it didn't work correctly. I followed the directions and still it wasn't counting steps correctly. This definitely put a damper in my eagerness to get healthy. I returned it for a refund.
4,Casina Rossa Truffles Trio Pack,"Great deal, although, I am still excitedly trying to figure out how I can use the truffle honey and Carpaccio. Absolutely amazing!"
4,Math fun for the mathmatically challenged,"My son hates math! But, he loves Star Wars and Jabba Math. Would recommend it for other kids who find math boring and feel insecure in their skills. It allows for several ways to solve the problems and appeals to the visual learner."
2,UGHHHH!!!,The game doesn't save at all and that's really irritating because you can't turn your computer off without it completely deleting your progress. Also it turns on and off randomly so when you exit the game all of a sudden it pops back up again. My six year old thinks it's fun but he gets frustrated with it.
1,Hurts my ears.,"Came across this accidentally and took it home to play--thought it might be a good gift for a seven year old I know. Games are fun, so far as I could stand the decibel level. For me to hear the voices, the music was so loud that the total sound hurt my ears. If the relative loudness of the music and voices were reversed, this would be a better product."
5,Simply Jumentous!,"The young gunsel, the old poger, and the ingler can now rejoice: They *finally* have a book of their own."
5,impulse shopping,"I was standing at a bookstore's special orders desk, waiting and I picked up this little volume. I was stunned. My laughter flowed like water in Niagra. I've used several of the lovely words, with friends and associates. Last night at my poker game I gave a small educational lecture about the english language, and made sure to keep my drink next to me - so with my compatriots newfound knowledge, they would not find a moment to leint my beer. I recommend this book to anyone that find's language interesting and/or useful."
5,A must have for sarcastic folk.,"I'll keep this short. It's a great comprehensive guide to obscure words and insults. If you are a fan of such things, or just like learning different words, this is a book for you. It is in dictionary form complete with word, pronunciation, context, definition and the occaisional illustration. Once you read it, you will finally know the proper term for all of those annoying cockalorums, muscods, breedbates and shotclogs you encounter every day. If you want to know what those words are, get the book."
4,"Imaginative English, more like.","I saw this book in a bookstore in Eureka Springs, and found it on amazon much cheaper. I have enjoyed reading about words that are no longer in use, and that have some comical meanings. If you are a bibliophile, I highly recommend this gem."
4,Washington's first battle revealed,"When I lived in Brooklyn I was interested in its part of the Revolutionary War; one of the first major skirmishes took place blocks from my home. John Gallagher does a good job of introducing me to the political and social climate of the summer of 1776 as America rebelled against King George III in a fight for our independence. He relates the history in an easy to digest format, dropping in interesting tidbits of trivia along the way to keep it interesting. What I enjoyed most about the book was in allowing the reader to follow the progression of the battle by giving the reader geographic locations and street crossings of current Brooklyn, with lots of maps and pictures. This gives me a history to hold in my head as I walk around my borough, and have already visited some of the locations noted in the text, including the Old Stone House, which I used as a location for my own short story about that battle."
3,Standard,"I don't really have a review, it's decent information, I was just curious about the Kabbalah rage and reincarnation, the book didn't engage me, the chapters were a bit repetative, could have been said in 10 pages if you ask me."
1,"This is not about Kabbalah, it is only about the author.","This book tells us nothing about Kabbalah, or about reincarnation. Rather, it only tells us about Berg's brand-new religion that is attempting to create.Frankly, all of Berg's books on Kabbalah are full of terrible translations, censored and edited texts, and horrible commentary. His ""explanations"" are rejected by all Jewish authorities, Orthodox and non-Orthodox, religious and academic. Berg is attempting to create a non-Jewish and for-profit version of Kabbalah, and it is just embarassing. Instead of reading his nonsense, please check out books on this subject by real authorities and good writers:Read, for instance, ""The Jewish Mystical Tradition"", by Ben Zion Bokser; ""Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism"", by Gershom Scholem; ""Zohar: Annotated & Explained"" by Daniel Chanan Matt and Andrew HarveyI would also suggest ""The Wisdom of The Zohar: An Anthology of Texts"", Ed. Isaiah Tishby, and translated from the Hebrew by David Goldstein."
3,Only Okay...,"This book would be fine if you didn't have a budget or don't want to be told much in the way of interesting stories in your guidebooks...I much preferred the Rick Steves Paris guidebook, which has better accomodations at better prices, while focusing on certain neighborhoods where you can mingle with the locals.This is sort of a touristy guide that can complement the Rick Steves books in case his accomodations are booked or you want more comprehensive listings of the expensive restaurants in the city.BTW, my wife and I left ours at home and went to Paris with the Rick Steves guidebook (which is slimmer) instead. We did rip out the useful maps, however."
3,A helpful guide - but not the best one available.,"This guide covers all the basic information needed for a trip to Paris, but is not as complete as the Michelin Green guide as an information resource, and not as helpful in organizing and planning your trip as Rick Steve's Paris guide. It does, however, have more hotel and restaurant information than either of the two other guides I mentioned."
4,great shoes,must have mat black shoes for work. These shoes are comfortable for the long hrs that i'm on my feet for at work. Replace them every 1 1/2 or so.
5,Great Shoes,I really enjoy these shoes I love Nike. Maybe I'll also get a pair of low shoes as well someday.
3,Disappointing,"I did not find this map particularly helpful, but then there is not much available on Bolvia. I was looking for a detailed relief map. This map is somewhat simplistic, but some people may find it useful. In my opinion, it does not contain a great deal of information."
2,not much book for the money,"This book is a flimsy paperback, and very short. I got it for my niece for Christmas, and she wasn't all that enthusiastic about it, so I kind of feel like I wasted my $3.99 + shipping. I didn't happen to flip through it, but the cover was glossy and colorful, so I guess it wasn't a total loss. Although, next time I will wait until I see it at a garage sale for a quarter before I consider buying it."
1,Sticky!!,"I purchased this grill with the hope of having an easy-clean grill and griddle. Boy, was I disappointed. My first cooking endeavor was grilled chicken. I grilled the chicken and it was fine-tasting, but the clean-up was horrible. I let the grill soak for two days, but still I had to use the end of a wooden spoon to clean the grooves. Crazy. This week I tried French toast on the griddle side. I even oiled the griddle before I put on the French toast...you'd have thought the toast was made of pure sugar (there's not any in it) by the way it stuck -- and stuck hard -- to the griddle. I have no idea what I'm going to be able to cook on it without it sticking! Maybe I'm doing something wrong. I'll try again..."
2,Missing pages,"The book is good, from what I could read. There are several whole pages of text missing from the first five chapters. The missing pages are 16, 17, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29, 32, 33, 36, 37, 40, 41, 44, 45. SInce this is a text book for a history class, the missing pages severely degrade my overall leaning of the Cold War."
5,Be inspired!,"This is a great inspirational book to get you thinking about your life and where you want it to go. It makes you peer into your life and think about the type of person you are--and if that is who you really want to be. A.C. Ping (the author) definitely ""keeps it real"" by writing in slang...it makes you feel like he's a friend of yours. It is an easy-to-read book with a few workbook pages in it for you to write your own thoughts. A great book that shouldn't be passed up!"
2,Poor quality paint.,"I used this scale for one semester in one three credit class. Basically 3-6 hours a week for 15 weeks. The numbers and scale are painted on and the paint has worn off in many places already from pretty light use. Basically if it rubs against anything, it has a chance or rubbing off the paint.Nice concept, poor quality.edit: I did carry it in my bag a few times. If the product came with a case, the paint probably wouldn't have scratched off."
4,Handy Scale,Nice construction. Like that you can change scales without moving the rule. Handsome addition to desktop.
4,Adjustable architects scale,"I have used one of these for over 40 years for different projects. When my old one got so beat up I couldn't see the lines anymore, I ordered a replacement. The new one is just like the old one, and I expect to use it for many more years."
5,Beautiful voice!!!,"Heard her on the new Christmas song and tho't I'd want to hear more of her. The CD is primarily contemporary Christian music -- which isn't my favorite -- but the young lady DOES have a beautiful voice. If you're a fan of contemporary Christian music, you'll LOVE this one!!!"
2,will skim foam but not oil,"Because of its holes, it only works if you try to skim for foam alone (as when you are making stock with a rolling boil).If, however, you are also trying to get rid of whatever light oil film comes to the surface (for instance making stock with a light simmer to keep your stock nicely transparent), you are out of luck as the oil disappears into the skimmer holes.When reading the description, I assumed that there would be enough of a surface effect that would stop the oil from exiting through the holes - wrong! I tried it the day I received it. It looked beautiful - and it still does - but it does a lousy job... I am back to skimming with a very flat, thin, large spoon, which enables me to take out both foam and oil film.On the other hand, it does a fine job at lifting large solid objects out of a pan, and it is a handsome piece - so there is some redeeming value.My conclusion - if you want a true skimmer, pass on this one."
4,Essential kitchen tool,"I've owned my Calphalon skimmer for about a year now. If you're serious about cooking, you should definitely own a skimmer. A skimmer is essential to making good stock or broth, since you absolutely must skim off the scum and impurities that rise to the surface during the simmering process in order to get the proper clarity and flavor. If you leave that stuff in, it breaks back down into the stock and gives you a muddy look and flavor. The Calphalon skimmer is a nice tool for this."
2,A Dictionary - Just a Dictionary,"If you are expecting more than a dictionary- Don't buy this book. If you are a reenactor, this book is not for you. The book is filled with names of items and dictionary type descriptions. There is very little written text beyond that. The book seems to be geared more toward the beginning and end of the 1800's with little regarding the 1850's - 1870."
4,Where are the Pictures?,"As a history buff and aspiring novelist of the California Gold Rush period, I found this volume fascinating. I learned a great deal about slang, clothing, courtship, and how people entertained themselves. Unfortunately, a text-only book is insufficient to properly describe clothing and hairstyles -- or convey exactly what their houses looked like. The book desperately needs drawings or pictures!! The dictionary-style organization is useful, but I would have preferred more narrative text describing each subject before McCutcheon launches into definitions. This volume is definitely worth a spot on my bookshelf, but I'll keep hunting for something that provides the visuals."
4,"Somewhat helpful, very interesting","I myself write westerns, so I bought this book in the hopes that it would help my writings be more accurate. While the information contained in this book isn't quite as specific as I would have liked, it does have some very interesting and entertaining facts, such as slang terms cowboys used, the terms used for the different hairstyles during the 19th century, and common diseases that plagued the population. It also lists the different types of horses, which is a tremendous help for me. If you write novels or are just an avid history buff (of which I am both), then I think you will find this book interesting."
3,For the casual user,"This volume is a fantastic idea. Unfortunately it was not executed with the depth or rigor that would have made it a fantastic product. The information and terminology included is of a fairly superficial character, handy for the casual user but not adequate for more ""hard-core"" needs. I've been using it to write a script. It has come in handy on occasion (and it IS nice to have the information in one volume), but I keep having to seek other sources to round out the picture. In particular, this work would really benefit from some effort to distinguish the radically different worlds and language of the early, middle and late parts of the century. Overall, it's not bad, but it's not likely to be anyone's dog-eared prize reference either."
3,Limited,"The problem with this book as a writers' guide is that it doesn't give any indication of how to put the material together. It lists words, terms, dates, etc. but doesn't give an idea of how contemporaries *felt* about things. No overall picture is presented."
3,Interesting reading,"This is a well-documented book on life in 19th century United States. However, I do have one complaint. In the chapter on African-Americans and slavery, the author barely touches the subject on free blacks, dismissing most as poor. Granted, the majority of free blacks belonged to the working class, the author seemed to have forgotten the number of middle and upper-class African-Americans. After all, they did exist in antebullum America!"
1,OCR difficult to read,"This is book was made by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 1. There are many typos. 2. The original footnotes are in a double columns, so the OCR process mixes the footnotes up. 3. The lovely pictures are not included. 4. The chapter Titles look no different than the body of the text. 5 There is no spacing between paragraphs. It is not much fun using a book produced this way. Buy a copy that is not produced by OCR!This review only applies to copies produced by OCR."
4,As good as any other...,"I have used gloves from all the major brands over the years and have found there is little difference between many of them in terms of durability. Most of the cheaper ones last just as long, or sometimes longer than ones costing five times as much. This glove does the job and provides a comfortable and solid grip on my sticks."
5,Writing as Healing,"I am writing a memoir with the guidance of Linda Joy Meyers' book. It is not an easy task to re-live the past, yet I have found that with the inspiration of this book, I am able to move through my story with guidance and support. I am now almost done with the first draft! Thank you Linda for all your insights and help."
5,It's All True,"Dr. Myers says in her book that writing memoir can be healing. I have found this to be true. This book is filled with information about family dynamics, wisdom about the healing effects of writing memoir and being compassionately witnessed in our life stories, and even extensive practical advice on the writing process itself. This powerful book has been very helpful to me. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in self-discovery and exploration of the meaning of life events through writing memoir."
3,"Awesome Concert, but I couldn't play the dvd in my blue ray","I bought the DVD not knowing it was in European specs. It would not play in my blue ray, but was able to play it on my laptop."
5,Rain jacket,"This item is a great choice providing lightweight, breathable, waterproof comfort. It's excellent for outdoor activities or everyday use. Very satisfied."
5,Excellent Rain Jacket,"If you are looking for a comfortable,light weight, well made,truly waterproof jacket, you have found it. My wife and I each have one and love them,we will be purchasing another for my daughter.We have used them to bike ride, walk the dog, etc. You will not be disappointed."
2,Not for heavy rain,In heavy rain and wind water gets inside this jacket because there are no flaps on the pockets and no protective rain flap covering the zipper
3,A Solid Rain Jacket,"This is jacket does what it's advertised to do; it keeps you dry. While other reviewers have found the size of this product a bit large, I think the sizes are fairly accurate, at least for male users (keep in mind that this is basically a unisex product). Moreover, the sleeves on this jacket are actually a bit short, at least for me. That notwithstanding, the jacket is of pretty good quality and is rather stylish."
3,Gets HOTTTT inside,"Like the title 'New Englander' - this jacket is best for mild-moderate rain and cool ambient weather. I used this in India and it was fine against the rain, but the poor ventilation or rather the water-proofness of the outer shell being so good, it made me cook in my own sweat. So people in the 'tropics' are best away from this."
3,RAIN JACKET,There should have been a note in the product description to say that the jacket is unisex. I purchased a medium based on the sizing chart and now I will have to give it away as the medium is way too large for me and seems more suitable for a male and not a female frame.
5,My son clapped for the songs even while running a fever,"My 23 month old son loves this CD. He cannot listen to it enough. Recently, while he was running a fever, he was not eating or drinking much; he only seemed comforted by lying on my chest and listening to this CD; he kept his head down throughout each song, but would raise himself up to clap and say yea at the end of each song to show his appreciation. I don't think that he could give it any higher praise than that. My wife and I thoroughly enjoy the songs too."
5,It's worn out...and I have to get a new one!,"I bought this for my son when he was born...he turns 2 in a couple of weeks and he listens to it at bed time and nap time....I absolutely LOVE this CD...the music is just amazing and I will always have memories of it playing, and him laying next to me or on me when he was just a newborn. I urge you to get this CD! I am looking for more in this line because we now have a multi CD player! I can't wait to listen to more!"
5,Great start to great trilogy,"This book was a great start to what i thought was an awesome trilogy, and it opened the way perfectly to start the RPG in any way you like. It was introduced to me by my old roommate and he was only able to find the first book i liked it so much i went on a search to find the rest. I found all the Torg novels and the rest of the original trilogy and never did i regret it, and niether did my roommate and our friends we all loved them."
2,"Bad novel, great Roleplay-Game","Well, this book IS a bad role-playing game. The novel itsel, quite plainly, is a pain to read. There is only one reason why you should buy this book - and the two sequels. They are the introduction to the TORG role playing game by Westend Games. TORG, to be quite honest, is a great game, but unfortunately the designers expect everybody to have read the novels. You can play the game without having read these books, of course, but they really help you figuring out what's going on.Fans of the RPG should get them, others - avoid!"
5,Savor Every Word!,"Jacqueline shares a story about each recipe that transports the reader to the wonderful place that she first discovered the dish. Her recipes are as wonderful as her stories. They are easy to prepare, and have been favorites of my family since Jacqueline wrote her first cookbook ""California Rancho Cooking"" I am buying a second book for my son who grew up helping prepare Jacqueline's recipes. He has since become a Chef."
3,Not a Stylish Performance,"Just in case anyone has read my recent reviews of CDs featuring the music of the Venetian composer Baldassare Galuppi - Missa per San Marco and/or Vivaldi-Galuppi Salve Regina - and feels an urge to hear more of this excitingly new ""old"" composer, let me warn you away from this recording. Two of the seven concerti are the same as those on the Missa per San Marco, where they are performed much more expressively. The orchestra on this CD - Orchestra da Camera di Venezia - is four-score missing any taste of period style. The sound quality from Tactus is shrill and distorts easily, even on a 'flat' setting. Not a good choice."
2,Disappointed,"The bulk of this book is the author selling you on the importance of good posture, and introducing you to some general principles. It's basically one long introduction. It almost reads like an advertisement for an e-book, where you keep reading in hope of finding some actual content. I read one chapter, skimmed through the rest, and then came to the end, where he lists a bunch of different stretching and excercise routines that you can choose based on what you think you need. That's okay, but that kind of thing I can view for free with a little google searching, so it's not worth my money.If you want to find a good book on posture that really teaches you something about your body, try The New Rules of Posture by Mary Bond."
4,"Easy read, fun diagrams and informative.","This book is written for the average person to understand and apply to themselves without the help of a professional or expert. I like how the different exercise programs are presented depending on the areas where postural alignment is off in a bullet point format and then described in more detail later.I have noticed that there are a lot of typos and miss-worded sentences, but you are still able to understand what is being said. Over-all I would recommend the book as a great reference for improving physical health."
4,Informative little book!,After having some back trouble and the doctor recommending posture alignment I decided to order this book. I found it informative and helpful for my condition.
1,Big disappointment,"This CD reminded me of what gets played when a band breaks for intermission. It is cocktail lounge background music. Same base beat in all the songs, practically the same la la la's in the background (supposed to be the vocal part). Has a New Age electronic sound which lacks in audio quality and aesthetics. There were three of us listening to this CD and we had the same opinion about it. Diane Arkenstone has other excellent CD's which is why I bought this one. I regret not doing a sampling of the music first and have learned a valuable lesson."
4,Wonderful Music...,"I bought this CD on impulse. I had no idea who Diane was or what her music sounded like. I just wanted some new age music. When I listened to it, I was completely taken away. My favorite track is 4, Beyond Borders. The music matches the title perfectly, as do the rest of the tracks, and I was almost overwhelmed by the deep, dramatic sound, but every song is different. Basically, this CD, I think, is worth the money."
4,Melodic and Upbeat,"Each selection on this CD has a melody, which can be defined as a series of notes preceived by the mind as a unity. You will not find spaced-out ambience here. Few people realize that Diane Arkenstone has undergone several pacemaker implants and will more than likely have future heart surgeries. In spite of her pain and lifestyle constrictions, Diane constinues to write, perform, and produce music that uplifts the soul. I love this CD and play it as background music. I also listen to it while driving. Recommended."
5,very good mood music,"I got into this via listening to a ""new age radio"" stream and was captivated. Loved this stuff, its a bit like ""Enya"" stuff, but with a smooth beat, if you like this also try sarah mclachlan. nice music that you can put on your Cd during a candlelight dinner... or whatever. Wont wake the neighbors. Good quality."
1,I Can't Stomach It,"ANY movie that has a scene with a guy making out with a grandma should be banned. Gross.The whole movie is disgusting in general. It's about a woman who discovers a cure for old age in Africa. But the cure only lasts for a day, and it must be mixed with the juice of a freshly killed person for it to work at all. So for the woman to stay alive and young, she must continually kill, and THAT'S why she's called the leech woman. She leeches off of others to retain her youth. It's actually a good plot, but the movie is so disgusting I have a hard time watching it.I've seen plenty of movies worse than this one, but I haven't seen many grosser than this."
1,MST3K couldn't really salvage it.,Since I can't swear and get my review published I'll stop here; it blows
1,Worst film ever,"That pretty much sums it up. The old woman's good, everyone else isn't. Filmed In Africa? YEA RIGHT! You can just feel the stock footage. But hey, what do you expect? It's the 50's! Horrible after horrible movies were made. Skip this one."
1,A great movie if you are into add-libbing.,"This is the type of movie that was never meant to be big, unless by big, you mean big dud. Though I must confess, my friends and I absolutely love to make fun of this video by making commentaries through-out the movie. Don't watch the movie with seriousness. It's one of those movies that is made to make fun of. I give my own commentaries to the movie five stars. Perhaps you can do better..."
3,"INTERESTING ,BUT SILLY HORROR FILM !","Like many of the 50's horror sci-fi films this one is ""done in"" by silliness and cheap production. The premise is interesting but, the results are unintentionally funny at times. I read a review on this film from someone who stated that Hollywood needs to remake pictures like this instead of really good films. I think he or she has a valid point. These films would be welcome to remakes with so much room for improvement. This film is one of five on volume 2 of The Ultimate Sci-Fi classic collection. The DVD transfer is very good. I would not hesitate to buy this set as the first set is OOP already and fetching a hefty sum on the secondary market."
3,Jungle Jim leeches onto youth,"I actually watch this on DVD as part of a set. They must have remasterd the film as it is not scratchy or blurry. Parts of the film are really steamy in more ways than one.Dr. Paul Talbot (Phillip Terry) is working on an anti-aging formula. On the side he wants to dump his older aging wife (Coleen Gray.) That is until he needs her to help with his experiment.We get an African experience of the jungle Jim type. Wild animals, lots of dancing, and many secrets. Looks like they may become native-chow.By the way Gloria Talbott plays doctor's assistant. You cannot miss her from 26 films and 81 T.V. appearances. I remember her best in ""Perry Mason"" (1957 TV series).I Married a Monster From Outer Space"
4,Classic vintage horror.,Great movie if you like the genre. Unique concept & plot line. I'd like to see someone remake it.
4,WORKED AS ADVERTISED,"PULLED IT OUT OF THE BOX, PLUGGED IT IN AND NOW THE COMPUTER WORKS A WHOLE LOT FASTER. WORKS AS ADVERTISED."
5,I loved the Viactiv Calcium plus Vitamin D ...,"I loved the Viactiv Calcium plus Vitamin D Supplement. Never before has taking a calcium supplement been so easy or tasty! Even my daughters finally looked forward to taking their vitamins. This is an excellent product. It tastes great, it's easy to take, (not just another chalky pill), and it provides essential calcium. I would definitely recommend this product."
4,I found this product to be very appealing. ...,I found this product to be very appealing. I'm not big on taking a lot of vitamins but I AM a chocoholic and found that this product was tasty and healthy for me. What better way to get your daily vitamins in -- than in something that tastes great?!!!
5,What a pleasant way to take calcium!! Each ...,What a pleasant way to take calcium!! Each 500mg dose is like a little treat and since it's supposed to be taken with meals it becomes your dessert. The mocha flavor is subtle and delicious and I would assume that the other flavors are just as good. I think that I will no longer forget to take my calcium with these little goodies!!!
4,"Overall, I think this is a good product. ...","Overall, I think this is a good product. However, I don't like that I need to take it 2-3 times a day. I'm just too busy to remember the 2nd or 3rd serving. I am used to taking my calcium supplements along with my other supplements. I remember the first, but I frequently forgot the others. Perhaps over time this would be easier to remember. The product itself is a very good idea (for those with better memories than mine). The flavor is very nice -- smooth tasting. I like that they are individually wrapped so you can take them with you when you're on the go. I would recommend my family and friends to give it a try. Maybe they'll have better luck remembering to take them. If they came out with one that's only one dose a day I would definitely buy it."
4,I really love this product. I feel good ...,I really love this product. I feel good using it knowing that I'm getting the amount of calcium my body needs since I'm not a big milk-drinker. I would highly recommend this product.
4,This is a great alternative for calcium supplements. ...,"This is a great alternative for calcium supplements. The taste starts like chocolate, but ends up tasting like coffee. And it isn't too bad, even if you're not a coffee drinker. I would recommend this to anyone over the antacid products used for calcium."
4,Not a bad book for its size,"I've been happy to teach ESL students from these books (Eye on Editing 1 and 2) for the past several years. My one complaint is that my students need more practice than the Self Check and Editing Practice sections contain.Though I try to incorporate student writing into the editing exercises, I often find myself spending a lot of time modifying student writing so that it can be used for the target forms--since student writing rarely has only one type of error.For the next edition, it would be nice if the cross reference in the back could be updated for the newer editions of the referenced texts; trying to find the ""Focus on Grammar High Intermediate Second Edition"" wasn't bad, but the authors have changed to a numbered series.All told, it's a nice book to work on during an 8-week session, but the inclusion of more focused exercises would be nice--even if they were only online."
4,A better barney,"My daughter loved this one, out of the three that I purchased. As an adult I liked this one the best. Aleph Bet's first song is about meeting a bear, getting a gun and running away. Hardly the kind of song I want to teach my pre-preschooler."
1,Run while you can dont by this notebook PC,Please whoever reads this please never buy any of toshibas notebooks they are junk. Let me first say I agree fully with the first comment I have had my Toshiba notebook the same model for less than a year and it crashes all the time. I let Toshba know all about the problem and sent it to their repair shop. I just got a call today and they said the Tech does not know how to fix the hardware because it keeps shutting off on him. I told her he better find a way thats what it did to me all the time. I at this point will never buy anything from Toshiba every again. I have had so many problems with this laptop. Keep in mind you have been warned also Toshiba has a lawsuit against them for thier M35 laptops people say they crash and freeze all the time sound familar. Trust me you would be better off with the empty box the notebook came in.
4,gr8 piece,"This is great laptop. Amazing screen true to its name ""Tru BRIGHT"". DVD Multidrive & WIFI 802.11 G is sure handy.The only issue is 4 cell battery which lasts abt 1 hr or little more. BUt then if you want long battery life, u need centrino...dont you? So you should have considered it before buying Celeron M processor laptop.This is my second toshiba & i am not at all disappointed. Infact, my freind bought another one after seeing mine. All of you guys going for small screens, have a look at WXGA 15.4"" screen & you would never want small.I luv it..!"
1,Pathetic battery life,"My brand new Toshiba M45-S169 laptop has a battery life of <1 hour! If I had known that Toshiba was selling the M45-S169 with a substandard battery, I would have selected a different computer. Toshiba fooled me. Shame on them. I'll never buy another Toshiba product."
1,No whistle!,"I loved the different look of this tea kettle and was sold on its uniqueness. However, I soon came to find out that the lack of the whistle feature is important. When the water boils it is extremely quiet and not noticeable. I almost burned the house down!"
5,D.J. Conway does it again!,"I have two books by this author, the other being ""By Oak, Ash, & Thorn,"" and I must say, I found both of these books to be quite thorough and extremely accurate. ""Lord of Light & Shadow"" is a must-read for those Pagans who have long shied away from the male aspect of the Old Religion. You will be delightfully surprised...I know I was."
3,Inspiring.....,"Although this book was inspiring, and opened me up to the various possibilities of the God in my personal magic and worship, I found a major flaw in this work. I have always thought that Wicca (as this book undoubtably is)'s only anomosity towards Christianity was claiming that it was ""the one true and only right way"". That its God was ""the true God"". And here is a clearly Wiccan author, speaking confidently about her God as ""the true God"". The Christian God, as is any other God, is only a single way to view the divine---certainly not a ""false"" image. I am a Wiccan, and I find her comments offensive. I am only surprised that more people haven't mentioned this in their reviews,"
2,Get a grammar checker,"The great content is marred by countless grammatical foibles which make the book nearly unreadable. Here's an example: ""By default denying access to every one, is the first step of a reliable security policy. In this way we eliminate the possibility of forgetting someone or to making a mistake."""
3,Not bad for the price,"Its not one piece like the picture shows. The plastic is kind of soft to the touch. But overall, its a cheap way to accesorize your phone!"
3,Just One More '30s Crime Book,"Another of the countless mundane ""true crime"" books cranked out in the wake of the hit film ""Bonnie and Clyde"" back in the Sixties. The case histories of the major headliners who gained notoriety during the Middle Western crime wave of the Depression are accurately, if somewhat blandly, chronicled. Quite indistinguishable in that while the names, dates and places of events are well documented, very little, if any, new information is unearthed. Basically just a rehash of old news, even back then, when ""The Devil's Emissaries"" was published in 1969."
5,WHAT A PLEASURE,"BEFORE BUYING THIS NAIL GUN I HAD NEVER USED ONE BEFORE. I TALKED MY WIFE INTO BUYING THE COMPRESSOR AND GUN COMBO KIT AT HOME DEPOT FOR MY BIRTHDAY----WOW-----. WHY DIDNT I BUY THIS THING YEARS AGO? I JUST FINISHED A BASEMENT AND A KITCHEN WITH OUT IT. NOW IAM WORKING ON BATHROOMS AND ITS A DREAM, NO MORE HOLDING AND BEATING A FINISH NAIL INTO A PIECE OF MOLDING AND HOPING IT WONT SPLIT IT, NO MORE GOING BEHIND MYSELF AND SETTING ALL THE NAILS. I HAVE FIRED PROBALLY 5,000 NAILS IN TWO BATHROOMS ANY ANYTHING ELSE I CAN FIND WITH NO PROBLEMS, WHAT A DREAM,COULD KICK MY SELF FOR NOT BUYING IT EARLIER. THE GUN IS VERY USER FREINDLY ANY ONE CAN OPERATE SAFELEY, EVEN A SEMI AMATURE LIKE ME. IF YOU HAVE ANY HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS IN MIND THAT ENVOLVE NAILS/BRADS INVEST IN THIS GUN YOU WONT BE SORRY ITS MONEY WELL SPENT. ANY DOUBTS RENT ONE FOR A DAY AND THEN I GUARANTEE YOU, YOU'LL WANT ONE."
4,Pulley moves smoothly,This Pulley exercise set works fine for increasing shoulder range of motion. The rope length is just about right. The rope could be just a bit smaller in diameter to get a smoother motion. The pulley is plastic; I'm not sure what kind of load it will handle. It does not squeak like a metal pulley I have.
2,Boring,"I was pretty disappointed with this book. It was just chapter after chapter of short stories about various couples' relationships. I could probably sample all of my friends and write a book very similar to this one. For instance, if Jessica and Daniel argue a lot...we can surmise that they were lovers in their past 5 lives and they have unresolved conflict that they must try to resolve in this lifetime. I practically gave up after chapter 4. I skimmed the other chapters, but it was just more of the same. I was disappointed with the redundancy of the book."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"Book provides excellent accounts of Edgar Cayce readings. In fact, that is what 95% of the book focuses on. I was hoping the book would also provide insight into soul mate relationships."
3,Entertaining Book,Midnight Fox is an entertaining book about a little boy who discovers the differences of living in the city and in the country. He goes to the farm for the summer and has many adventures while he is there. Read this book to find out what exciting adventures he has.
4,A great book for children,"The Midnight Fox is a favorite of mine for elementary school children. It has it all: humor, a great moral, a little ambiguity, wonderful, poetic passages, and a young boy overcoming fear. I've read it to several classes--I teach--and they always love it."
1,it's over...a sad ending,"It's heartbreaking and painful to listen to this album. The sexy glorious voice is completely gone now. I still adore you, Chris..."
4,I'ts The End !,Behold the end of season 1 when The Winx Club and Red Fountain warriors return to defend Alfea but the Red Fountain warriors and Stella and Bloom go into the CloudTower tunnels to find the Dragonfire but end up having to escape leaving Bloom and Sky to find the Dragonfire in crescent lake and then return to Alfea as all three schools unite to fight the Army of Decay and The witches! I'ts a DVD you can't miss!
5,This dvd guide,"This is it!The moment we've all been waiting for!The last five episodes and the season one finale of the winx club finally arrived!The episodes are:22-mission to Cloudtower:Bloom,Stella,Sky and Brandon guided by the ogre Knut go to Cloudtower in order to rescue the witches.23-the search for the flame:after rescuing Riven,the heroes finally rescues the witches.24-battle for Alfea:while the Trix sends the army of Decay to weaken the fairies of Alfea,Bloom heads to Lake Chrysalis in order to get her powers back.25-the greatest witches invasion:the witches makes there greatest invasion yet.26-fire & ice:after recovering her powers,Bloom tries to stop the Trix.Thanks for reading my review."
5,One Happy Little Girls,I went online looking for these for my daughter for Christmas. I was thrilled to find them. She was over the moon excited!
4,I love Read or Die,"Everything about Read or Die is great the animation, the storyline,and the music. I love the jazzy/electronica tracks. However alot of the tracks on the oav soundtrack do sound somewhat the same."
2,Great Book!,"This book was bought because it was on the syllabus, otherwise we'd fail the course. anyway, the book is very well thought out for math wizzes and it's dedicated Homework sections are very encouraging for those who are beginning to understand college level Calculus. If you have a good math instructor you may do well in the course with this book. Overall the book has its highlights such as the colourful graphs and pictures... Stuff that will make you want to turn the pages for non-math majors. Overall it's a fun book (for math majors) and it's filled with numerous chapters for one to read and try to understand! The chapters are very didactic and with that in mind you will unravel your mathematical nature...For those who buy this book for the homework, relax, it has the answers in the back."
1,Scary stuff,"The book is unbelievable cra..., it's hard to tell because the stuff that the author put is very super unbelievable cra... I belive the author doesn't know the advanced stuff or might be he just like to play with the beginner stuff. Don't ever buy this book for your reference,future,or what ever that you need. This book is not bible for mathematician,science and engineering student. But this book is a holy bible for donald duck, pluto, and their friends. I suggest if you want learn calculus well, I really highly recommend spivak,apostol,or richard courant. There is no dictionary that you can be a mathematician by using this book, unless you want be a ""greatest"" mathematician."
1,This VCR's DSS control won't work with RCA recievers!,"I bought this VCR, and RCA's DRD420RE DSS reciever and they are not compatable. The vcr will not control the reciever. The reciever demands a four digit channel number (or the ""ok"" button) and this VCR cannot do that. I called RCA, spoke to management and customer service and they offered no solution. RCA really dropped the ball on this one, they don't even list Philips as an option for recievers as I have one of those too, but they list Primestar which is out of business...The commercial Advance doesn't work very well either..I am going to return it."
1,A piece of junk!,"This VCR lasted only 4 months. Every time I try to play a tape the picture comes on in freeze frame mode! The machine will not go into PLAY mode. It will not fast forward, rewind, nothing...it's completely dead. For being one of the supposed top of the line models for RCA this VCR is anything but reliable. I used to sell electronics for a living and we received many RCA products back from customers. I took a chance because of the decent price and many features, boy did I make a mistake. I will not bother to repair this because of the cost, so I will end up trashing it and look for either a Toshiba or Hitachi."
3,There's more to be told,"What this book lacks is, as the previous reviewer said, the relocation strategy that is required in order to assume your new identity. Information on how to fake references (as mentioned in other books) in order to obtain jobs as well as being able to sustain the new identity (in terms of back history, etc). For the most part, the book goes into great detail about the advance work that must be done in order to successfully create your new identity."
4,"A little out of date, still VERY good for those new to this","This book is a little out of date, although some methods are still valid. Those that are still valid are very good and do still work. The California DMV does still only ask for birth certificates and such. However, the dead infant method does not work anymore, and word processing is not new technology.Still, a very, very good book!"
3,WHA Aeros vs Jets,It was pretty good. They should not have Gordie Howe on the Front with Bobby Hull. Gordie is not even on the DVDs. The game shown is in 1978 when Gordie was in Hartford/ New England.
5,Nice book...,"I bought this book used, it was in very good conditions when it came... I was surprised because it looked like new and the price was fabulous ""GOOD DEAL"" Thanks to Amazon..."
2,Frustrating and inaccurate,"Haynes manuals used to be fantastic; sadly, that is not the case with this one. Some key information is just plain wrong! For example, the description of how to replace the rear suspension arms contains some serious omissions. Even a simple operation like removing a front seat is explained in an inadequate and slipshod manner (yes, I am still trying to figure out how to do it).Maybe detailed diagrams like those found in competing manuals (e.g., Chilton) would be more useful than the photographs in this manual.Haynes claims that the manual is based on a complete tear-down and rebuild; was it a Camry they were working on?"
4,Save a trip to your mechanic for info,Used this book to see how to remove stuff from the junk yard or to stuff another radio/cd into your car without breaking the plastic. Not a how to repair but how to get at the stuff & where it's located
3,"I used the Nature's Resource Dong Quai, Women's ...","I used the Nature's Resource Dong Quai, Women's Ginseng Capsules for one week. I have begun to feel more energetic and more positive about things than in a very long time. I am certain that with continued use I will feel better than ever before."
3,"A fun read, but not my favorite Anne Stuart...","""Lady Fortune"" was enjoyable, but for one reason or another, I just couldnt seem to connect very well with the characters...paticularly Nicholas. I love Anne Stuart, and I most definitely wouldnt dissuade one from reading this book..it was sweet and it moved a long nicely, it just didnt grab ahold of me as tightly as I would have liked. Not a keeper for me, but definitely worth reading."
2,Huh?????,"I don't get it. This book got stellar reviews, was written by the incomparable Anne Stuart, and features a unique hero....Why did I dislike it so?Here are some of my reasons:1. I felt like the story was boring. A boring Chalice was the ""centerpiece"" of the plot and the story contained a host of characters that I didn't care for.2. A strange romance between a court jester and a lady...one that I struggled to understand and accept.3. A different kind of secondary romance between the heroine's mother and her husband.4. This was just a very difficult book to get through. I didn't like the plot, the characters, or the romance.... which should've earned it a dismal 1 star, but Anne Stuart's superb writing earn it the extra star,I recommend Lord of Danger, Ritual Sins, Nightfall, A Rose After Midnight, and To Love a Dark Lord."
1,the toilet mouth sisters,"perhaps reading this play would be a bit more enjoyable of the main characters weren't dropping F-bombs every other word. as it is, highway manages to write a story about a bunch of bitter, foul-mouthed women who cuss and argue their way to a bingo match. wow. how invigorating.if you want to read a good play, go check out the crucible by arthur miller or a raisin in the sun by lorraine hansberry - not this junk."
1,Not necessary,"This guide is simply not necessary. If you are installing your own Blum tandem drawer slides, then you already have all the tools necessary to accurately install the hardware. I can only see purchasing this if you're a professional and need to install 30 slides in a day.Blum's products are wonderful, but spend your money on a good square and collared drill bit set instead."
1,blum customer dis-service,"When you order a Blum drawer slide, the instructions say you must purchase a template for 50 - 60 dollars for the placement of the mounting holes. I guess the company is too cheap to supply a paper template or dimensions for the hole drillings for the products they sell. Another way to rip off the customer."
3,Not quite everything you want to know about car design.,"This book should have been better. Though the author doesn't seem to know it, his perspective is overly slanted to GM/ Harley Earl mindset. The writing itself will only hokd the interest of the most dedicated, and GM fixated readers. If you're looking for solid info on Ford designtriumphs--the '60 Lincoln Continental/ or Mark II, Mustangs, the late 60's T-Birds, you'll be disappointed. Chrysler is similarly glanced over. The interviews are good, but tighter editing would have been appreciated."
5,Kottke baby one more time,"After seeing the ever impressive Leo Kottke in concert many times in Australia. The last twenty years have been a search for one such video/DVD to complement my record and CD collection. Apart from the extra features such as snipets with Doc Watson and Chet Atkins, Leo's quirky humour is translated in his cameo interviews.Straight up the DVD is simply a private concert in your own home and a memory that is being viewed on your TV. What more could you want. Also cheaper than a ticket to a show.S.Harcourt-Bell"
5,"If you like Kottke, you have to see this.","This intersperses great Kottke footage with ""interview"" footage. It's not really an interview, just Kottke talking about interesting things from guitar playing, to art, to life. What you get here is a view into Kottke the individual. The experience is most like meeting an eccentric at a downtown hardware store in small-town America and getting some off-kilter life advice and humor, but if the eccentric were a nationally-celebrated incredible musician.I've watched this documentary with Kottke fans and non-Kottke fans alike, and all have enjoyed it and become Kottke fans.Just buy it, already."
1,A Musical Feast for the Ears,Kottke is always an amazing guitarist to listen to. This video is laid back and comfortable to watch and is a guitar lovers musical feast. Enjoy it!
4,Entertaining and highly impressive,"Usually I do not care much for taped performances. I find them annoying and more than once seeing the artist 'live' is a disappointment. Not so with this Leo Kottke dvd!In this dvd Kottke does not only show his incredible skills as a composer and professional guitarist, but the interviews that have been cut into the recorded performance show an extremely funny Kottke at home, in his car, in a guitar shop and (quite funny) in his basement with 'bad guitars'. This makes the video not only a true pleasure to watch and listen to, but also highly entertaining. For the duration of the video that is great, but I must admit I feel sorry for Leo's son whom he quotes saying: 'Dad, is this another one of your jokes...'"
4,Leo Kottke-Home and Away,"I was thrilled to finally get this concert on DVD since the old VHS format was impossible to find or afford if I did find it. I saw Leo in person locally a few years back and was astounded by his guitar prowess and his dry wit. The only thing rally missing in this concert is more of his very funny banter, but his music more than makes up for that. It's too bad we can't get more of his live concerts. They would be high on my ""want list""."
3,Problems with mounting,"The illustration is not accurate as far as what you get. At least not with the kit I got.Major problem is that there are slotted holes that are too wide for the provided bolts and washers. You are supposed to torque the bolts to 25 ft-lbs but just hand tightening them causes the washers to sink into the slots.Need to find some good thick steel washers that are wider than the slots.One thing I'm not too pleased about is that the steps don't really come out far enough from the side of the car for my size 9 feet. They line up with the sill but because the doors curve out I find I can only get my toes on the step pads. OTOH, my wife has small feet and she gets on fine with them which is why I got them anyway.Note that there are two mounting brackets for each side, not three like the photo shows.Very easy to install into original threaded holes in the chassis but be prepared to re-tap them due to rust and gunk. (Metric)"
4,decent BT headset w/ caller ID,"having used this headset a few times, i noted that it syncs well and works well generally. but the fit around the ear is not optimal and sometimes the caller ID is flaky."
2,I was so disappointed,"I was so looking forward to reading this book. Rather than describing in detail how they managed their family needs in an incredibly small space (and what about school for the kids?) it was a Hallmark version of a prepubescent daughter's first altercation with her dad. Yes, it's a quick read and could have been a fascinating story. Too bad it wasn't."
5,i have met this family and visited them in greenwich village,"i received this book a couple of years ago and was enchanted by it. i live in NJ so for the last 3 years have gone to ""jane street"" to see this wonderful family. the first year i brought my book with me and the entire family signed it and were absolutely lovely. the next two years i have welcomed them to nyc and brought them cookies, popcorn, etc. they are a joy to manhattan and all mankind. a marvelous family who arrive in their trailer on jane street the day after thanksgiving ever year since 1988 or 1989 (forgot which!)---if you are in new york during this period in time - go pay them a visit; fanatastic family!!!!!!"
3,A OK Christmas read.,"While this is a ""true"" story, it left me with a few questions. Since selling trees for one month seemed to supply most of the family income for the year, where did the trees come from? Did they grow them or buy them? What exactly did this family do for the other 11 months? Since they only had a ice chest in their trailer, where did the venison for the occasional meal come from...the corner NYC grocery store? With the cost of electric, I find it hard to believe a neighbor ran a line to them to light a tree lot for a month. Overall, it was a wothwhile Christmas read...I think. However, I could have done without the less than ideal future family doings."
4,Great light holiday read,This was a great light hearted Christmas time read. It was a wonderful story about family just in time for the holidays.
3,Nice but screw too long....,"Looks good and works well. But the screw running down the middle is too long, as a results it sticks out of the back of the bracket about 1/16"". I solved it by grinding off the extra length so it didn't bother me much. I actually bought another one."
5,Does the job,"Make sure you use a stub when you install these. I bought half a dozen of these things and have nearly all my guitars hanging in my music room now. I don't have to worry about the pets scratching up my instruments any more. Since I don't have them in their cases anymore, I play my guitars more now."
3,Pretty Good But not sure its best for my Strat,I have an early 2000s Fender USA Standard Strat and I find that the headstock is just large enough to be contained on the hook. if you tilt the guitar a bit one side that side falls through a bit and relies on the curved portion of the strat headstock to keep it supported.. granted it will not fall through but at times the guitar hangs crooked do to this flaw
4,does the job,"Holds my Strat and my bass just fine,They look a little flimsy but they work for the purpose for which they were intended."
4,holds the guitar well,this is nice. it holds my acustic guitar off the floor. it has a wider neck to fit mine. bought another one that was too narrow.
5,"Easy to mount, looks great, good price",This is my second String Swing guitar hanger. They both look great and are much more space conscious than floor stands.
5,Everything you need is in the package,"The only thing you need to have to install these is a philips screwdriver. The packaging includes drywall toggles and screws. Took me longer to figure out where to put them than to actually install them. They're good for up to 15 pounds even if you can't find a stud and have to use the (included!) drywall toggles.I had budgeted most of the afternoon to get three hangers installed, due to the inevitable trip or two to the hardware store to pick up something that wasn't included, but it's all there, and I was done in a half-hour."
5,Good Product and Awesome screws and drywall anchors!,"Awesome things to note about product:made in usa,solid construction and the cherry on top are the heavy duty drywall anchors!I have bought a lot of things for my house that have come with crappy wall anchors.... this is top notch.mosh and roll"
5,Guitar hanger,"Great item , easy to attach to the wall , well packaged with clear instructions . Padding is excellent to protect the guitar . Now the guitar is on display and safe . Love it ."
5,Works Great!,"Easy to install, and does exactly what it's supposed to do. The black metal wall-mount looks inconspicuous against any wall and does a good job of holding and presenting the guitar to the room. Reasonably priced, and the hanger sticks out enough that you never have to worry about the base of the guitar hitting the wall."
5,Great Product,I bought two of these for my husband. He has several guitars all lined up on the floor in stands. They are a bit jammed so I thought it would be nice to get a couple off the floor and on to the wall. They will then look like art! They come with some gigantic wall anchors so I hope he finds a stud to screw them into instead. I don't want a huge hole in the wall if they need to be moved someday. They are nicely made and sturdy.
5,Simple and sturdy,I installed this a few hours ago. It came with all of the necessary parts to install in sheet rock with or without a stud. It installed easily. It was able to accommodate a 3/4 sized guitar without any modification or adjustment. It seems very sturdy and it looks good.
5,A+,"Hangs on my wall perfectly well. I have put my ukulele, two different acoustic guitars and an acoustic bass on it and it still holds up perfectly. I was worried the bass would be too heavy, but apparently not. Gonna buy two more soon."
5,Hanging Out In The Living Room,"I am happy with the String Swing in price, form and function! Works great with my guitars, as there is clearance for acoustic dreadnoughts and electrics and can safely cradle the guitar. You will not beat the price of this product for simple ""hangin` your guitars so they are safe and so you can really enjoy there art. My wife loves the String Swing on the TV wall so we can both appreciate great art on our living room wall. :~)"
5,good stuff,We bought two of these guitar mount arms for my sons' guitars. They have a nice look and cushioned feel and the wall mounts seem sturdy thusfar. We were not able to mount them into studs so we had to use the drywall components and they seem to be holding up well...just make sure your guitar is within the weight tolerances. I would recommend this item.
4,Decent Product,"Solid built unit, other than the plastic standoff. (the part between the baseplate, and the fork) Looks like if you got a little crazy with tightening it, that you could bust that little piece right out of there. Also, the hardware enclosed is borderline useless. Do not mount this thing into drywall alone. Either find a stud and use 2-3"" course threaded drywall screws, or mount a strip of wood (1x4 works perfectly) across two studs, paint it your wall color, or stain it, and sink 1 1/2"" screws through the base plate into that. You won't have to worry a bit then. Very good product when ""real"" hardware is used. Would definitely purchase again."
4,Easy to install and looks great!,The String Swing Acoustic Guitar Wall Hanger is perfect for displaying rare or decorative guitars. My wife and I collect autographed guitars and I was able to hang them on the wall with no trouble in spite of the fact that I have very little handyman abilities. They also look sharp. I've gotten a lot of compliments on how cool they look. Highly recommended!
5,perfect,does what it says soft for the neck . comes tith the hollow wall faseners and screws easy install. great
5,Easy to install and simple design,"I've bought a couple of these and think they work perfectly. Screws are long but narrow and no need to anchor into wood. Into drywall or plaster, I would use an anchor."
5,"Worked great, easy mount, holds my geetars","Bought 3. Mounted 2. Worked perfectly on an acoustic and a Fender Strat. Saw earlier comments about ability to hold a heavy guitar. Not sure what that guitar was made of, but this will hold any guitar I am aware of (based on weight). Included anchors worked fine on one and on the other I hit a stud which worked even better."
5,Simple and Effective,"I was just looking to hang my guitar on the wall to get it off the ground and out of the way. I live in a smaller apartment and try to utilize every bit of floor space efficiently. This guitar hanger is great. I was able to find a stud in the wall, so I am not worried about it falling. I think the wall anchors that come with it would be fine too. I find myself pulling down the guitar alot more often to play as it is more accessible than being in its case. It also looks neat as a decoration on the wall. The hanger is discreet behind the guitar, so all the attention is focused on the guitar. My brother-in-law came over and right away noticed it. So I bought him one for his dorm room. He loves it too!It is really cool, I would definitely recommend this to anyone I like."
5,guitar hangers,"I bought 4 of them for one wall in my office/studio, and the hangers look and perform great. I was a bit concerned about the heavier electic guitars, but the provided sheetrock anchors are holding well ... if there are any issues in the future, I'll just create a back board for it. - very pleased."
4,Very functional,"These hangers do a great job of keeping our instruments off the floor. They're attractive enough that you don't really see them at all when the banjo is hanging there. It needs a diagram for instructions on installation. While they say you can bend the parts to fit any instrument, I was unable to bend them or even make them really wiggle. But I didn't really need to. The photo shows these little rubber washers that help keep instrument from sliding off. #1 the instrument isn't very likely to slide off without the rubber washers and #2 I couldn't figure out how to get those things on there! So installation was a little confusing, but they do a great job anyway. I should also mention that we use these mostly as decoration. We don't play the instruments often, so it's not like we take them down and put them back up each day. There's not a lot of wear and tear on our instrument hangers."
4,Very solid guitar hanger but mounting hardware not that great,As the title says I have no complaints with the hanger itself. Once I got it fastened securely to the wall it looks nice and hold the guitar well. The mounting hardware is not very good. The drywall plugs are too big and then do not hold on to the screws. I have installed hundreds of drywall plugs over the years and had to toss this set in favor of some plugs I bought from the hardware store. Ideally you want to install this thing into a stud but that isn't always possible and in my case I found out that the plugs provided with the unit are inadequate.
4,"good, sturdy, good price...","""An instrument in its case doesn't get played"" is a true quote for me. My acoustic guitar and bass sat in their cases unplayed. I wanted a stand, and almost got 2 floor stands. But I have had guitars tip off those stands in the past, and I liked the idea of putting the two on the wall... so after looking at what was available on Amazon I picked these wall mounting brackets. They mount easily, I was able to find 2 studs (after screwing in the first screw of each bracket into dry wall sans stud first), and each in solidly attached to the wall. I have an acoustic bass and guitar up now, and neither rests against the wall when hanging, so no vibration will be passed from the wall to the instruments... I think they're great."
5,Great quality and price,Very sturdy and easy to install. My sons guitars are expensive so I made sure I installed them on studs in the wall. They are adjustable to fit different widths in the neck and the padding keeps the mount from scratching the guitar head.
3,A noble try...,"First of all, I'm a fan of both Tomowa-Sintow and Domingo, but neither of them sounds particularly fantastic in this recording. I know it's live, but Domingo had more difficulty than he normally did with the high notes (though some of his interpretation was new and beautiful), and Tomowa-Sintow scooped up to virtually every high note. Her voice sounds great, but this, perhaps, was not the right role for her.All supporting characters, with the exception of Fassbaender, who sang very well, but with little personality, were terrible. Two foghorn basses and a bass singing baritone. Really terrible stuff.The ensembles sounded great, and I loved how it was live (sound quality was surprisingly good).Overall, a good purchase for a collector or some one who likes Tomowa-Sintow enough to tune out her wretched colleagues."
3,For fans of hibiscus and rose hips!,"Raspberry Zinger is based upon the famous hibiscus blend that was so popular in the 70's and 80's. This tea has a slight flavor and aroma of raspberry, on top of a hibiscus and rosehip base. The overall flavor is slightly sour. Nothing special but a reasonably good basic."
1,bad bad bad bad bad,"i got the phillips recorder 3 days ago.i was thrilled.one day after having it the sound when i played a disc was all distorted..awful sounding.after turning it off for a minutes it went away.then i recorded a song in fast speed..after playing the disc i noticed the sound on the recorded cd was all distorted on the last track..so i wasted 74 minutes on junk.then today i returned it ......came home plugged it in and the tray on the right side will not open,no matter what i do..i called the philips 800 help line they told me to return it...AGAIN!!!!!!!!if this doesnt make you decide not to waste your money i dont know what will."
1,A prize-winning LEMON!,It completely fell apart after 6 months. I had it repaired by the philips warranty technician four times. It died a year afterwards. This is the worst product out there. Stay away from philips magnetbox products.
3,Video Cassette Recorder (VCR),"I have bought a few of these vcr's from Amazon and my biggest complaint is that they don't last very long because the rubber belt in it stretches and I can't find them (rubber belts) to repair them. I tape a lot and then transfer to dvd, so a good working vcr is a must. It dosen't matter what brand name is on them, they all are the same, but for the price I will continue to buy them until they no longer have them."
5,What a surprise!,"I was told about this band from the Netherlands by a coffee shop owner in Taneytown, Md so I decided to take a chance on the cd. What a genuine surprise! This band plays country-rock-Americana with passion. They remind me of Steve Earle and Uncle Tupelo with a little Springsteen mixed in. Edwin Jongedijk, the lead singer, has written all the songs on this album with one of my favorites being ""What do you want me to say"". ALL the songs are good. I also got a chance to hear them live in an acoustic setting and they were fantastic."
4,Good book for beginners but not newbies,"This book is good for beginners in Physics, especially for students in high school who want to learn more.Attention, this book is not a substitue to standard text book, you need some basic knowledges to understand this book. It is good for beginners because this book let you thinking in Physics not just tell you how to solve problems. It will show you the story how Physical theory evolve.I hesitate to give this five stars just for one reason, there are very few diagrams in it. While Asimov is as clear a writer as there is, ""a picture is worth a thousand words"".Besides, the service of the seller: internationalbooks is GREAT, they deserve five stars."
3,"Good for a while, but then it degraded","We bougth two of these. One of them quit working and, since it was still under warranty, we sent it in for a replacement. The ""answer"" button of the replacement quit working three months later. Wasn't sure Moto sent us a new or refurbished one. Anyway, we are out of luck because the warranty expired.For the second one, it worked great for a year, then the mike really degraded. It was hard for the other caller to hear what we said into the mike. We were told that it sounded ""muffled"", but we couldn't figure out why.We are now looking to buy two new bluetooth, a little more than a year after we owned them."
4,Good product. Worth a buy!,"I'm happy! I've had the Motorola Bluetooth HS850 for some time now and I think the H700 is a very good improvement & replacement!I read tons of feedback on this and the caveats that caught my eye were:1. Watch for counterfeits!2. Check what version you're getting: H700A, H700B or H700C! (sounds like B/C is better?)Pros:* Great volume (I've had to turn it down in my ""high roadnoise convertible!)* Very comfortable* looks great* Does not sit against cheek to muffle sound - I guess that's just correct ear placement.Cons:* Sound quality vs the HS850 is a little tinnier/highpitched, but only slightly!Overall: Well worth it! (I'm getting a second one for my wife)"
1,unreliable,"The device was used with RAZR and I had a horrible time with it. It drops signals out of blue, the headset won't find the device even when the battery is in full condition. I have no idea when and how it works. It is just unreliable."
3,convenient but noisy,"I bought this product for my husband who travels alot. When I talk to him, it seems very noisy in the background. Once, he was in the airport and I couldn't hardly hear him over all the background noise, and he also sounded muffled at times, and it would cut out a little. I was also talking to him from the car and it had alot of background noise there too. It also has some static on the user end while talking. It is very convenient, but noisy."
2,signal not strong enough?,"I'm disappointed in this product. I researched which headset I wanted for close to a month before going for the H700, after reading many good reviews. I was able to get it all paired and all but whenever I try to actually hear a call through the headset my phone gives a message saying the signal isn't strong enough. What the heck? I've wasted a LOT of hours trying to figure it all out from the skimpy instruction manual but now its been setting aside for the better part of 2 weeks because I just don't have time to mess with it. I'm making the trip to town in a few days and I'm hoping my cell shop will be able to help me out. I wish I wouldn't have bothered buying this. Too much hassle for my liking. Not user friendly."
2,Busted,"This product (probably defective because my first H700 worked fine) doesn't work well at all. The fully-charged battery dies after 15 min, there was static, etc. Better technology is out there."
1,Disappointment,"I bought this item for my daughter for Christmas. She was so excited until she tried to use it. It doesn't work. It took me an hour to fiqure out how to sent to back. I did this morning, but I have to pay the postage. I paid $8.50 to get it here, now I have to pay it again to return it. It seems it's not worth ordering anything when I have to have these additional expenses plus the dissatisfaction.Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset"
4,A PRESENT FOR MY MAMA,FAST SHIPPING. IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT THAT I HAD TO GET ONE FOR MY MOTHER. SHE SEEMS HAPPY WITH IT TOO
3,Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset,Liked it for a moment Didn't really get to use it. It was stoling from me.I guest so one else like it too.
3,Bluetooth,"These devices are somewhat fragile and easy to lose. They should have device locators on them. It work well, but very short range of < 20 feet usually. Lots of static at times too."
4,Motorola H700 Bluetooth,"Motorola Bluetooth Headset H700When I first received this product, I had some difficulty pairing it with my cell phone. Make sure you read the instructions carefully! And make sure you keep the instructions-it comes in handy IF you buy a new cell phone. So far, I am loving my bluetooth"
3,motorola h700 bluetooth headset,pros- easy to pair with treo 750- very long battery life- snug fit- inexpensive (see con below)cons- people on the other end often complain about muffling- appeared to have been opened/used/returned; i guess that's why the price was so low
1,horrible motorola product,"This thing was the biggest waste of money. Its unreliable, hardly ever works, and it does not securely stay on your ear. I charge it every night but it's usually dead by the end of the day even when it is turned off. I hate it and I wish I never bought the stupid thing."
1,Not worth the money,"I received my H700 today. Following the directions, I fully charged it and then opened the mic boom to turn it on and pair it with my phone...it should have shown a steady purple light indicating that it was in pairing mode. Instead, I got the slow flashing blue light for receiving a call and it wouldn't pair with my phone.This headset is a piece of junk. I am returning it and looking for another, better quality headset."
4,Motorola Bluetooth - Good Value,"I purchased two of them recently - one for me and one for my wife and we are both happy with them. THe sound quality is very good and volume excellent. They are very light on the ear and comfortable to wear. Good value for a name brand electronic product, necessary in the car to avoid getting a ticket now."
5,Great Bluetooth Headset,"This headset has been wonderful. I bought it to help free up my hands while driving my daily commute. I also like being able to see my signal meter and can tell when I am about to drop a call. It is light weight and I it connects with my RAZR almost instantly. Set up was very simple and the battery life if pretty good. It took some time to figure out all the features, but overall it pretty easy to use. The speaker is plenty loud even if there is a lot of outside noise, and the noise reducing technology has been wonderful when talking to other people. Everyone that I have talked to have said they have no problem hearing me even when the wind is blowing or when the window is down."
3,Try it for yourself,"Everyone seems to have different experiences with Cascara Sagrada. Personally, I didn't have great results when I took the pill. However, when I opened the capsule and brewed it in a tea I had greater results. I really don't know how great this product is when most of the literature says it shouldn't be taken for more than 2 weeks. I also saw some literature suggest use for no more than 8 days. So if you are looking for an every day herbal regularity supplement you might want to keep looking, but if it's short term use you are looking for you might want to try Cascara Sagrada."
4,Classic 50's Horror Movie,"Insofar as I am aware, this movie was the first of the Japanese horror movies of the 50's. It's black and white as was common for the times and the special effects are very crude compared with today's computer generated stuff. The audio is actually very clear with a Japanese flavor which seems somewhat tinny to the western ear. A great way to revisit memory lane - saw this one in the neighborhood theatre when I was growing up."
5,The One that Worked,My husband has been suffering from acid reflux for a long time. This book outlined in a very clear manner the contributing factors and solutions. With in a few weeks he has reduced his symptoms. I have bought several health books over the years and urged him to read them. This one he actually did. Great information.
5,Just do it!,"When I ordered this book, I really held out little hope that it might help me. I was experiencing worsening reflux, despite H2 blockers, and I had a long history of daily GI distress. I don't really expect anyone (myself included) to swallow the theories of causation of GI problems put forward by the author, but she is quite correct about some things.The book is quite comprehensive in its discussion of GI ailments and detailed methods of therapy. I remain skeptical about the author's theories of underlying mechanisms of disease, but I can not argue with the results I've gotten from following her advice.If you are suffering from a chronic GI problem, I strongly recommend you buy this book and make changes in your diet. You might be surprised at the results. I was."
3,Lasts only 12 hours,"I do not like medicating my child but during allergy and cold season, I do not like her being miserable either. Claritin doesn't work for me, and for my daughter, it only works for 12 hours. I feel bad about this because after 12 hours the sniffling, and itchiness of throat comes back. Benadryl acts quickly but I can only use that at night. And not until the 24 hours is up for the Claritin. I am taking her to the pediatrician to see what they can suggest for good allergy relief. I have read up on medications and I do feel that these two meds, benadryl and claritin are low key meds, as in no adverse side affects or anything that causes alarm."
3,Good ideas,I am a front line manager and I like to keep trying new things and keep my mind fresh. This book has some good ideas in it. One of my biggest challenges is keeping my employees focused. I think they begin to address this but not to the degree I would have liked. Its the old 80 20 rule. 80 % of your time should be spent on 20% of the tasks that matter most. Good book just left me wanting a little more.
4,Pretty bright in spotlight,I used these to replace the bulb in a crown vic spotlight. Bulbs are pretty bright and throw a good distance. Price was right.
4,Finally Found This!!,"I purchased this cd years ago when Loretta was appearing in Las Vegas. I happened to be walking through the lobby of one of the hotels with a buddy and heard her. We stopped and stayed for the entire. She ended singing ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" which was the icing on the cake and I immediately bought the cd as they were selling afterwards. Someone broke into my car and stole my collection which included this, and I was never able to find it until now. Her voice is earthly, magical and perfect for the song selections. I can't wait until my order gets here so I can included it in my iPod and never have to worry about it being stolen again. Voice of a true Diva."
3,Doctoral Disertation,"If you are looking for sensationalism, this book will disappoint. This was originally required reading in a sociology class when Barack Obama attended Occidental College.If you can stand the this type of writing, you can glean some valuable info from the book.It's also pretty outdated."
1,blah,"the deliver of the book was excellent got it on time to do my homework, wasnt quite a fan of the book."
4,What is going on here?,"I can't believe this book is languishing here all alone, with no reviews, no picture of the dust jacket, nothing! This book rocks, people! It features a weird, insecure guy who doubts his own sanity, a bunch of very docile flatmates, an institute that delves into mental telepathy and some old fashioned throwing molotov cocktails down into other people's cellars. What more can you ask for?This book will freak you out, guaranteed. If you have ever doubted your own sanity (and lets face it, who hasn't? ) you will empathise with Ian Redpath's struggle to stop aliens conquering the Earth.The few Bob Shaw books I've read have seemed kindof lightweight, and this book is no exception. Its an enjoyable, quick read.I took off one star because the main character is an obvious ripoff of Arthur Dent."
2,Unorganized and confusing,"Clephan's book is informative, but it is hard to decipher the point he is trying to make. His lack of organization really takes away from the quality of the book. His chapters are not unified by any central topic, except the one on trial by combat, which is the best chapter of the book. There are many Latin, French, and German quotations with no translations. Clephan also spends page upon page describing events, pictures, and equipment in other books without illustrations or pictures to accompany it. I was disappointed also because he seems to address the tournament mostly in the 16th century, which many historians do not even consider to be the medieval era."
2,Tournament,"Very difficult reading. Assumed you kew how to read french and latin paragraphs(ok,so I didn't pay attention in school)could have used translations following the quotes. Pretty much a jumbled mess. On the plus side the descriptions of each tournement were very detailed(more than I wanted to know)."
1,A complete waste of money!,"This isn't a training tape, it's a pitch to get you to buy things from her website. The information appears to be ripped straight off an Animal Planet show. The tape quality is horrible and the editing was apparently done by a ten year old child.This trainer says she's a top trainer? I searched goggle and AKC records and I can't find *one* mention of any of her ""acheivements""- little wonder after seeing this feeble attempt at a training tape.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SKIP THIS ONE!!"
1,Why would you do this to your dog?,"This video is awful. Why would anyone choke their dog like the sadist pretending to be a dog trainer in this video?I understood a little better reading the more realistic reviews - apparently, the video trainer is a fraud, which would sure explain the cruel punishments that she puts animals through. I shudder to think that people pay her in real life to train a dog - they must be crazy!"
1,Awful and cruel training methods,"Please do not support the cruel and outdated methods of training used in this video and by the her training center in Atlanta. I spent a few weeks there and was appalled by the abuse under the guise of ""training"". Her solution for barking dogs is to muzzle them! Dogs have to pant to control their temperature! She has no business training people to train dogs!"
2,Meade Mirage 7x35,"Ok folks, If your looking for optics that will blow your socks off... look elsewhere. I bought the Mirage 7x35's for my #1 sons 13th birthday, and I feel they are up to their cost/value, plus a notch or two. You dont get BAK4-multi coated, super duper anything, nor should you at this price. If you are in the market for binoculars at a low-low price, theses will fill the bill. If you are looking to do some binocular astronomy, low light stuff, or are critical about optical quality, save up for the higher end stuff."
5,Bookof the Dead,The item purchased was and audio book by Patricia Cornwell. The book has been very entertaining thus far. I have not completed th book yet.
1,The Author is a convicted con artist,Title says it all. If you buy this book you are probably beyond hope anyway.
1,I suggest avoiding,"This could be the most dangerous, irresponsible diet book on the market.There is zero proof that HCG has anything to do with fat loss. The only reason people lose weight on this diet is that one is consuming only 500 calories per day."
2,Good product-bad book,"The first time I read this book I had already sworn not to spend one more dime on any weight-loss product ever again, including books, so I took it out of the library. Like most, I read the book and thought OK, so where do you get hcg injections if they're not legal in the USA. Of course if you subscribe to his website (an additional $10 a month) he will tell you. No Thanks!I recently saw a naturopathic physician who recommended hcg therapy for weight loss. She told me she had several patients who used it and she used it herself with fantastic results. She said the product is exactly what he wrote about in his book. She told me she would support me and told me how to go about getting it. The thing is, he sounds so crazy it's hard to believe anything he writes. He sounds like he needs to be locked up in a mental institution!"
1,Don't buy this!,"It's not worthy of any star, a weight loss program that you have to use injections!!!!He should have that on the front of the book, so no one would waste their money!Don't buy it!"
1,Rip Off,"This book is a total rip off. Don't waste your time or money. The ""protocol"" he gives you in the book is mostly colon cleanse every day for 15 days, shots from your Dr., and a regimine that no normal person (especially a working person) could ever follow.Take my advise and save your money."
1,Rediculous Expectations,"I was just looking for a little insight to loose that 5-7 pound that crept up by my 40th birthday, but I couldn't have been more disapointed with this book. While the suggested steps to take, may work if you are tucked away in a spa (or fat camp), the daily steps are completely unresonable to the eveyday working person. Seriously - professional collonix 2-3 times a week? Hour + daily work outs? (Duh! - of course you'll loose weight!) AND phase two includes an injection EVERYDAY for energy - administered by a professional. I'm thinking you would loose weight because you have no time to eat; going back and forth to each Doctor. You have got to be kidding me. ... no wonder ""They Don't Want You to Know About"" it - they would be laughed out of the weight loss industry. Currently you can find my copy of this book filed under the egg shells and yokes of my all white egg omlet from todays breakfast."
1,"THIS GUY IS A FUNKING THIEF, LIAR, AND CON-MAN","I would have given this book NO STARS if the Amazon software would allow me to! Kevin ""True Dough"" is a con-man, nothing more. I made the mistake of buying another of his books and it was full of information on how to get the informatiojn I was looking for! I could have simply done a Google search instead. DON'T BUY ANY BOOKS FROM THIS FLIM-FLAM MAN!"
1,Misrepresented,"I was very surprised and disappointed that this 'CURE' requires daily injections of a substance which is illegal in the U.S.! Also, the diet is so restrictive that it would be impossible to maintain unless one was in a residential program. This is not the impression one gets from reading the reviews or hearing his info-mercial. Trudeau makes it sound so simple to follow and maintain but IT IS NOT! I would return the book if I could. I was duped!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm sure that the cure would work if your were in a controlled environment and had a ton of cash to invest. This is completely FALSE advertisment. Trudeau says in his infomercial that these are easy things that anyone can do. The diet regime alone would be almost impossible for all but the very wealthly which he outlines in the book. Also the key to the ""cure"" is illegal in the USA. Kevin Trudeau should take advantage of the rich and famous who could possible pull this off instead of ripping of working class people. I wanted to give this book 0 stars but that isn't an option. There's nothing in the book that your haven't heard if you have researched weight loss, except the illegal part."
1,Trudeau Not Honest,"I have not read the book, but I just saw Kevin Trudeau on an infomercial and based on what most of the reviewers have said is in the book, he is a bold-faced liar. On the infomercial, he said that you don't have to eat diet foods - - that you can eat anything you want. Claimed he ate meat and gravy and ice cream for last night's dinner, and that he was about to go to his mother's and have all types of pasta dishes and pizza! And he also said no exercise is necessary - - that taking the substance and following the protocol would reshape your body. He also said that the ""Substance"" was very inexpensive and you can get it anywhere. It appears that he totally misrepresented what is in his book. I only chose one star because I couldn't post my thoughts without filling in that field."
1,don't waste your money,"Such a rip off. I preordered this and waited for garbage. It is impossible to get the injections and who would want to. The diet is very restrictive. All in all, a total wate of money. I realized one thing, that the key to a healthy weight is to eat in moderation, exercise, and watch out for these foolish scams. You will lose weight along with saving your money"
2,scam,"Don't bother to buy it. If you could follow the lifesyle and take all the supplements they recommend it would be a chore. You would consume yourself with watching every move you make. Just exercise regularly and watch your fat and sugar intake and your body and health will change for you naturally. It is the healthiest life change "" the clean way""."
3,Nothing simple about this,"While it may work, the technique requires injections. I don't think I'm gonna go there!"
1,DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS RUBBISH!!!,"If you really want to lose weight, pick up a copy of ""BODY FOR LIFE: 12 WEEKS TO MENTAL AND PHYSICAL STRENGTH"" by Bob Phillips. I'm currently on his program and it really works!! Trust me."
1,Rated 1 because 0 was not an option,"Please stay away from this book. As an RN I can assure you that there is no doctor in this country worth his or her medical license that will prescribe daily injections of HCG for weight loss - never mind the high cost that would be involved. I read the info up until that point and although I found it lengthy, I was intrigued - right up until the mention of HCG as the magic bullet to cure obesity. I promptly took the book back upon reading that. This man is obviously not interested in helping the masses overcome their weight problem , so please do not help him increase the weight of his wallet by reading this garbage."
1,what a rip off,"This book was one of the biggest rip offs I've ever seen. He stresses in his tv commercials that you can do this at home. Yes I guess you can if you have a way to get human growth hormone injections without going to the doctor. Come on, this guy needs to be shut down. I was stupid and bought this book. I tried to contact the publisher to complain but kept hitting a brick wall. I would advise anyone who is thinking about buying this book to save your money. DO NOT PURCHASE."
1,Some of the things he says is a little nutty... buy magnet rings?,"A lot of the stuff he says makes sense but towards the end of the CD he started saying some pretty crazy things like we should wear magnet rings to lose weight or do a exercise on a mini trampoline called ""rebounding"" that will ""clean the toxins out of every cell in your body"". HUh?? A exercise that will clean toxins out of all of our cells?? Sounds crazy to me.I wouldn't pay for this CD but I would recommend people listen to it. It does have a lot of great suggestions but mixed with snake oil so it's hard to take any of it seriously."
1,Waste of money,"I wish there was a negative number of stars... please do not waste your money on this!I bought this book and the other three books and i personally think this guy is not sane talking about trees that were giving off love to each other... There are no natural cures in his books, it's more about the FDA...The problem is i cannot get any of my money back but oh well... i won't fall for somehting like this for a long time."
2,You won't learn anything new,"Heard LOSE 30 POUNDS IN 30 DAYS! by Kevin Trudeauand don't think I learned anything new that the authorpromises in the book's subtitle: THE WEIGHT LOSS SECRETS""THEY"" DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT.That said, it served as a good reminder that I should drinkmore water . . . drink less diet soda . . . reduce dairy intake(despite claims by the food pyramid that this is good for me) . . . andsome 27 other ideas . . . out of these, I'll probably implementsome . . . yet I draw the line at regular colonic treatments--or evenirregular ones!My main problem with this CD is that it sounded almost as if itwere just an outline of Trudeau's book by the same title . . . in fact,he kept urging me to buy it for more information . . . I think I'll passon doing that, in large part because of the fact that Trudeauis not necessarily the guy I want to be giving me any sortof advice . . . while he may be a successful entrepreneur, heis also a convicted felon who has no medical background."
2,The Weight Loss Cure,"The book itself, arrived in good condition...however, I am very glad I did not pay full price for it ...it was very repetative...the message could have been written in about 20 pages or less. It seems to me that Mr. Trudeau is running out of material to push his books with. The subject matter can be found online, nothing new here."
1,Kevin Trudeau Makes This Plan More Difficult Than Necessary,"This interpretation of Dr. Simeons' HCG diet plan is NOT realistic. Kevin Trudeau has added So many EXTRA ""suggestions"" to ""improve"" the original plan that it would be very expensive and difficult to comply. I have followed the original Dr. Simeons' plan and it was easy and really worked. Suggest anyone interested in really losing weight with HCG check the original plan. You can get sublingual drops from most vitamin stores or just Google for Dr. Simeons and HCG. You really do lose 1 pound daily. I did it ... Don't let this book make it difficult for you."
2,"ehhh, okay","This book seems plausible, however, if a valid cure isn't easily accessible to everyone and affordable to everyone, then it's not much of a cure. Some of his ideas are really great, and he does have a recommended reading list that is a wonderful list of books that will tell people the things they really should look out for, but the weight loss cure itself--not all that..."
2,Weight Loss Cure Impossible to Get,"I have to admit that Kevin Trudeau does his research. However, the major weight loss cure described in his book is nearly impossible to obtain within the US."
2,UGGGGGGGGH!! boring!!,"Gosh it was like fricken reading the infomercial rather than watching. Three quarters of the book is exactly that. Then when finally getting to the main subject, ""how to lose the weight"" I was so disappointed with it. After doing some research and going to the doctor the ""cure"" he speaks of is not as easily assessable to get. What a bummer!!! He does though, give advise on some good products to use. The information he gives on exercise and dieting don't seem to be new."
1,Not What It's Cracked Up To Be,"This book had me going. I was reading and getting all excited about losing weight and then all of sudden it tells you that you have to take a shot everyday in order for your life style change to work. I must say that I was intrigued by all the information in the book and about the fact that most of our foods are filled with pesticides and things that could harm the body, but there was too much repetition in the book. I just wanted to know what the weight loss cure was. To me, its builds you up and then lets you down. One would have to find a doctor that gives the shots and not only that, you have to take them everyday. I am sure that it would be very expensive. The change in eating habits does not seem that hard, to eat organically, but man! It won't work without the shots. Big let down. Big let down Kevin."
1,The Weight Loss Cure,I did not receive this item. I got an e-mail from the shipper that this item was no longer available to them. There is nothing to review.
2,surprise,"After you've read almost the entire book does Trudeau tell you that you need to get 3 consecutive needles of a substance I probably couldn't afford anyway . And there's a good chance this is why mainly the wealthy do this diet. Natural cures ""They Don't Want you to Know about,Also written by Keven Trudeau was pretty informative but repedative. And in his More Natural ""Cures"" Revealed, it was just a repeat of the first book. I won't purchess any more of Kevin Trudeau's books. Again, He just repeats himself."
1,don't bother,"One of the other reviews covered it. JUST DON'T JOIN HIS WEBSITE, I made that mistake, supposedly didn't have an account when I went back and am still being charged, they don't respond. This company is just plain stealing from credit cards people use to buy things. I found out there are many people and lawsuits already, just google."
2,ridiculous diet,"I read the first few chapters and i was really impressed with all the promises. then i skipped to the actual diet part, and since then i never reopened the book. there's this list of 60 things to do and its almost like a full time job. its absolutely ridiculous. i dont know if it would actually work or not, but i just dont have the time for all that."
1,The Weightloss Cure,"Do not purchase this book! The the big weightloss ""cure"" is not even legal in the US and requires injections by a doctor. Give me a break! Amazon shouldn't even sell this book!"
1,Don't waste your money,"It would have been helpful before ordering this book to know that after Phase 1 (if you can even do it!!), you had to take urine injections(!!!) and be constantly monitored by a healthcare professional or doctor. This is the most convoluted and impossible diet I have ever seen."
1,Horrible! Zero Stars!,Don't buy this book or try this diet. My cousin and I tried it and we became ill. I am trying to report this to someone but since hcg is not allowed in the United States then I guess we should have known better. How can they let these people sell books that hurt people? Why does amazon even sell these books? it's not worth making yourself ill. Listen to your doctor like we should have.
1,Another scam,"Another waste of a perfectly fine paper by a world known con-artist. Negative five stars, Amazon?"
1,I do not recommend,"I saw this book on an infomercial and was intrigued - well, on the infomercial he states that everything you need for this process you can get at a drug store, like Wal-Mart and such - NOT! You need to get hcG injections, from a doctor, under a doctor's supervision, have 15 colon cleanses in 30 days at a colon therapists office - last time I checked, I couldn't get or do all that at Wal-Mart; let alone buy a lot of herbs and special stuff online or at a health food store. Not for me - no thank you."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"You should not buy this book!!! The diet that is recommended is very unrealistic and unsafe. You have to go on a 500 calorie diet and inject yourself with the human growth hormone. You can never go back to eating like a normal person...ever. This book is ridiculous. This author is after your money. No doctor in the right mind is going to be like ""hey, I'll give you drugs that the FDA has banned."" Um...that's illegal!!! The doctor would he risking his/her license to practice medicine!"
1,trash material,Total waste of time and money and conveniently leaves out the fact that this weight loss requires daily injections. Shouldn't be allowed to be advertised or sold because it is so misleading. How it got any stars is a miracle. There should be a choice for NO STARS
2,"The ""Cure""?","This book describes a treatment for weight loss that may in fact work. The problem is that the ""protocol"" is neither practical, economical, nor accessible for the average person. The so-called ""miracle substance"" portrayed as something anyone can just go out and get is actually a chemical that you must have a prescription to obtain (which is difficult, especially when considering it is illegal in the U.S. to write a Rx for this chemical for the purposes of weight loss). Again, the science of the protocol sounds like it may actually work, however, it seems incredibly out of reach for the average overweight reader."
1,Perhaps you should eat less and exercise more?,"West J Med. 1977 December; 127(6): 461-463.Copyright noticeHuman Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) in the Treatment of ObesityA Critical Assessment of the Simeons MethodFrank L. Greenway, MD and George A. Bray, MDClinical Research Center, and the Department of Medicine, Harbor General Hospital, TorranceUniversity of California, Los Angeles, School of Medicine.Injections of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) have been claimed to aid in weight reduction by reducing hunger, and affecting mood as well as aiding in localized (spot) reduction. We have tested these claims in a double-blind randomized trial using injections of HCG or placebo. Weight loss was identical between the two groups, and there was no evidence for differential effects on hunger, mood or localized body measurements. Placebo injections, therefore, appear to be as effective as HCG in the treatment of obesity.-----------------------------------------------------------'Nuff said."
1,big joke,I BOUGHT KEVIN'S BOOK AND NOW HAVE ALL THREE. WHAT A JOKE ALL HE DOOES IS HAVE YOU GO TO DIFFERENT WEB-SIGHTS. I WAS REALLY DISAPOINTED WITH HIS BOOKS. HE MISLEADS PEOPLE.
1,weight loss cure,"Glad I bought it here and didn't have to pay the postage expense, etc, if ordering from the infomercial. Too wordy. How many people can or will do the recommendations given (once you finally locate them)? A very disappointing book."
1,steer clear,Trudeau is a con artist growing rich from the money flowing from the desperate and the ignorant. Do a little actual research on him.
1,He is evil,This guy is evil and dangerous and I hope the people he hurts ruin his life through lawsuits and intimidation.Don't buy it. In every sense. Don't buy it.
1,Author,"Is good at selling. He is great at selling. He is one of the best motivational people around. Kevin, I know you read what people are writing on Amazon. Why not teach people how to sell and persuade and how to motivate. If you wrote books like that you would also be a bestseller and would get some good ratings too."
4,very good,Received my book quickly and was in the condition as the seller described. I would order from seller again.
3,The Weight Loss Cures .....,"Kevin said "" yada yada blah blah blah"" over and over and over again. Dig deep, skip and dig some more for the answers to your quest grasshopper. Then say ""I promise I wont buy debt cures, I'll borrow it""."
1,Expensive Ideas,The book has some good ideas but they are all based on very expensive products that not all can afford.
2,The Weight Loss Cure,"The book was very informative, but mentions a substance you need in order to lose weight which is not available. So in essence why bring to ones attention that this substance exist but cannot get in the USA..... in order to lose the weight. Bottomline, a waste of money."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Don't waste your time and money on this book. Trudeau's ""protocol"" isn't something that everyone can do, as he says. While there are many good suggestions for eating better, staying away from preservatives, etc., the crux of the cure isn't something to which just any person has access. That's why Trudeau says kings, queens, movie stars and others similarly situated have found this ""cure"" to be worthwhile. They can afford it."
5,a real eye opener,"i did the hcg diet and it was a good reference. I took off all my christmas fat . i didn't follow it word by word , but it was a great help."
1,Paranoid guy writes book to make money!,"Basically, the author is paranoid that the food industry and the pharmaceutical industry are in cahoots with each other to make all Americans fat and dependent on their products. Not only that, he constantly repeats the same philosophy over and over and over ...The only plus in the book is that it gives some helpful weight loss tips for those who are on Dr. Simeon's HCG Weightloss Protocol.Don't waste your money purchasing this book!"
2,A whole lot of nonsense...,"A lot of food sources for weight loss using a whole lot of different supplements. A whole lot of rubbish! The best cure for weight loss is less food and more exercise! ""You are what you eat"" is exactly the truth!"
1,Waste of money...,"""There's one born every minute."" Being able to ""obtain"" a miracle cure, for weight loss, from an informercial should have been a red flag. Those of us wanting to lose weight seem willing to try almost anything. We financially contribute to the prosperity of scam artists promising a weight loss miracle which never materializes. If a true weight loss cure were available there would be no need to have a late night informercial. Doctors, news reporters, nutritionists and so forth would know about something so spectacular and the public WOULD find out. Save your money. If you have money to spare and throw away... buy this and all of the other ""Secrets"" books. Even the information you purchase this book for seems to remain a secret as I couldn't find a ""to the point answer"" in these books. Promises of the secrets being revealed, on a website or in another format, is matched by spending MORE money and TIME to discover yet MORE confusing information."
1,Do Not Buy. Go To Your Library Free,"His book tells you to go and get colonics every other day. You would have to be a millionaire to afford that.It also tells you to inject yourself with HCG everyday. That is what they give to kids with Autism.Like all of his books, it is loaded with going to his website for information. I think we are all aware of this deceptive ploy, and I have read that people who do sign up for the website cannot cancel, or have a hard time canceling their subscriptions."
2,Rathered Disappointed,I was a little disappointed because the things he advises us to do for weight loss was a little outrageous. There were a total of 51 things to do. Many of which will cost you a lot of money. Some of the things he said about food is absolutely correct concerning chemicals. That part I did learn a lot from. The cure....not sure about that part.
1,Don't buy - he just wants to sell you some crap.,I got suckered into buying this book and half way through he says the diet will only work if you buy some crap from him that you can't get anywhere else. A complete waste of money and time. Probably unsafe.
1,Not what I expected!!!,"The book is definitely over hipped. The author claims he has this magic cure to trick the hypothalmus gland into releasing the extra fat in our body. The only problem is the material to do this trick is not available in the USA. It is actually illegal to sell. The book was full of the same useless garbage you see in a 100 other weight loss books on the market. Nothing new!!! This author is basically a snake oil salesman, but a good one!!! Simple formula for losing weight is eat less calories than you burn each day. Lose two ounces a day for a year and you will lose forty five pounds. Book is ""absolutely"" not worth the price!!! Place the book in the bathroom, next to the commode, and put a note on the top that reads ""Use in case of an emergency."""
1,NOT HAPPY,I was so interested until I found out that you can not legally get all the products to help you lose the weight....waste of money for me.
1,This book is a joke,"I watched this man talk about this book and how wonderful it is and that your weight problems were over, What diet has you giving yourself injections and some of the other things. I think this young man should stop doing what all these other false claims suggest. Stick with weigh watchers a diet you are doing all by yourself you are not doing anything but eating properly and excerising.Please try and help the public not make them buy something that they won't be able to do."
1,Loose weight by loosing money in your wallet,I was very disappointed to discover a book I had watched discussed on TV and had high hopes for was really full of unrealistic things to do to loose weight. There are many really great books and diets out there. This is not one to waiste your money on.
2,Weight Loss Cure not really obtainable,"I guess I took my chances in buying a book entitled ""The Weight Loss Cure"", but I have to say I was quite disappointed. Even before I made it to the ""cure"" part. It was very redundant. It seemed like there wasn't much to say so the author just kept repeating the same thing over and over. The ""Cure"", is not really obtainable for anyone I know. You would have to either be a doctor, or work for a doctor to do what you are suppose to do the obtain the cure. A little unrealistic for the average overweight American just looking for some help. I definately will not be pursuing this ""cure""."
3,The weight Loss Cure,"Although I decided not to cheat and read the book from beginning to end, I have to say I was disappointed in the actual ""cure"". Many of the suggestions in the book are good common sense. Some things are just plain unbelieveable. It seems to me that without the actual purchse of many of the suggested items and the need to have a prescription for the the HCg injections, the ""cure"" may not be as effective. True... with better nutrition some weight loss may be achieved, but as I look at the regimen and actually start to price the items, I discovered I probably couldn't afford the weight loss cure... something the book does not elude to until the middle of the book. I guess that's the ""aha"" factor."
3,bit extreme for someone who doesn't need to lose much weight,"Majority of the book is just marketing fluff. Coulda written a book 1/2 this size and 1/2 the price (but then he wouldn't made much $, huh?)If I were terribly obese, I might give this a shot. But I found a lot of the ""protocal"" was just common sense. (Drink a lot of water, eat lots of organic fruits and veggies, don't eat at restaurants, take vitamins, exercise....) I also think a lot of it was just not practical for me. (Hormone injections are just NOT going to happen. And all the organic foods and supplements are really expensive!) Again, if I were obese and desperate, I might take a chance on this. But, I found this way of eating/living just not realistic for me personally."
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get the book only to find out that one of the main steps is not attainable. The average person can not fly to another country to get the injections. Doctors in the USA will not prescribe or administer the injections for weight loss therefore the book is a let down. Kevin Trudeau offers some good tips but most of it is not practical. Also I ordered one book, received two and have yet to resolve this issue."
3,"Good & Bad, Yet Worth a Read","Here is the bottom line: I did not feel as though I could simply follow this plan. It's too complicated and appears to be hard to obtain. And yet, the more digging I did online, the more I think it is doable. It isn't ""cheap"". It isn't ""easy"" (I haven't done it; maybe it is) and my last negative is that the book itself is sooooo repetative.And yet, there is a lot of serious information that I have never read in any diet/health book before. I went searching a few things to find out if they are actually true and was surprised to find validity in a few areas where I was sceptical. If you are serious, read the book. I would bet real money that it would work if it was followed to the letter. Having NOT followed it (although I am keeping the option open for the future), I still feel the book was worth the time and money."
3,Weight Loss,The book was very interesting reading but the concept of going through numerous of items to loose weight was not for me. I guess I was looking for the easy way.
4,"INTERESTING READING, BUT HARD WORK!","THIS BOOK WAS A GREAT READ, BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR HEAD ON STRAIGHT TO FOLLOW ANY OF THE EXAMPLES SUGGESTED IN THE BOOK. THE FIRST THIRTY DAYS ARE INTENSE, BUT GREAT FOR DETOXING THE BODY!! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR THE SERIOUS, HEALTH CONSCIENCE DIETER. THIS IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!"
3,Good information,good information but I would have to take off a week or two from work to do this plan. Lots of steps involved.
1,Not as easy as it sounds,"I am sure if there were easy access to the injections required to lose the weight, this would be a great program. unfortunately, you have to find a Dr. willing to work with you and when you are doing something nontraditional that is not so easy. If you were wealthy enough to go to Europe to go thru the program prescribed, why would you buy the book?"
1,Worst Weight Loss Book Ever,"I have purchased many weight loss books over the years and this is by far the worst. I was anxious to find out the ""cure"" for permanent weight loss. It turns out that ""no exercise"" really means 1 hours walking per day. It also turns out that his miracle cure is injecting yourself with Hcg horomones and eating a 500 calorie diet. Of course you will lose weight eating 500 calories a day, you are starving yourself! And injecting yourself with a pregnancy horomone? When I was pregnant, I wasn't very thin. Also he recomends you get colon cleansings and take a ton of his ""supplements"". Again, worst book ever."
1,A total scam. Beware...,"...that the key components of this ""cure"" are enemas and HGH injections. Do not buy this book thinking that you can do this (a) cheaply, or (b) at home. The entire book, which is poorly written as it is, appears just to be a hodge-podge of other quirky diets (such as ""eat organic fruits and fishes"" and ""drink two tablespoons of Virgin Coconut oil per day""), with the added component of injected hormones, an infrared sauna (???), and doctor-administered enemas.Stay away from this unless you're planning on spending 60 days losing weight in the doctor's office/hospital."
1,Thanks to all before me,"I would like to thank the collective group of folks who have written about this fellow. I saw him on TV and thought i would check him out on Amazon. He sounded like a flim flam man on TV but I wasn't sure. i have read many Amazon ratings before and by far KT's were the most damning. Thanks all before me, I have taken your advise and NOT purchased his books. You saved me a few bucks. Thx"
1,Its a Scam,Don't buy this book. The author is spends more time describing his paranoia and conspiracy theory's concerning the FDA and the US government then he spends describing his cure. His cure is to use HCG a drug that was formerly used in Fen-phen anti-obesity medication which was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1997 after reports of valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension.
1,The weight loss cure they don't want you to know about,"The book repeated itself over and over. Plus, You need to not take any perscription medicines when you go on this diet. And try finding a Doctor that will give you an injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin every day. Impossible...Organic is the only good idea."
2,It was not that great,"This is not one of his better books. I appreciate that he fights the system, but this one, to me, is not well written and has an unrealistic approach. I would not recommend it."
2,Decent basic info but no real Cure,"This book provided some decent basic info in the beginning but nothing revolutionary. There were lots of suggestions that would be great if you are rich. Plus, I never really learned the weight loss cure. A much better and more complete and detailed book is ""The Six-Pack Diet Plan""--this book does not sugar coat weight loss and gives you some serious details on how the body works."
3,Solution,"very interesting!. He goes right to the point! going step by step cleaning your body, and doing a specific diet to lose those extrapounds."
2,Alot Of Hype; and a bit of a Scam!!!,"I read the book entirely, same message repeated over and over. Processed food is bad for you;....eat organic food only!!! Miracle substance is an injection that can be administered only by your Doctor. Available by prescription only, pricey, and hard to find in this country. Kevin Trudeau recommends going to Germany and getting a Doctor to fill the prescription for you. Thanks Kevin!! I knew your book was too good to be true!!!"
1,Don't Buy It!,"Want to know the ""secret"" that this author tantalizes you with? It's daily injections of URINE from a pregnant woman and to avoid all dairy products and foods that have preservatives in them. This book is total garbage! Don't buy it unless you just want to throw away your money and use the book for a fire starter!"
1,Kevin Trudeau,"Very Disappointed in this book. The author actually makes you think the solution is something that will fit into our daily 21st century lives. All the book says is you need to become an Organic, colon cleansing Vegatarian. I am truly disappointed and it was a waste of $20. If I could return I would."
1,Not Worth It,This book is not worth the time or money spent. The program is next to impossible. It requires an injectable product that is not even available in the USA. Waste of time!!!
1,Don't waste your money!,"Buying this book is the worst money I have ever spent. The first five chapters are a broken record. The remainder of the book is filled with absurd requests that the common working indvidual would not even think of attempting. Some of the requests are within arms length; however the majority are not. It is quite frusterating to purchase this book and then realize what kind of fortune he is asking you to spend. I now realize why he only caters to the wealthiest elite. The liver and intestines lavage does sound rather inviting, but I would prefer to lose my weight in what I would consider a medically approved manner. I would recommend that if you are contemplating purchasing this book you go to your local bookstore and check it out for yourself."
2,The Average Joe Review,The book has some good points - BUT if you had the money you would spendall your time trying to find the recommended foods. This diet would not beinexpensive - very expensive. My doctor said not to take HCG (and I don'thave any medical problems) - but the author stated if your doctor willnot prescribe HCG to change doctors - dont' think so.I would not recommend buying the book.
1,If only there were a '0',"Instead of buying this book, do this: take a $20 bill out of your wallet. Strike a match. Light the bill.You'll get the same results."
1,Lets get real--this is snake oil,"Kevin Trudeau wants you to get a daily injection, for 45 days, of a perscription drug that can not be procured legally in the United States for weight loss purposes. Trudeau's advice? If your doctor won't accommodate you and give you your daily injection of hCG, get another doctor, or smuggle the stuff in from abroad. That and the every other day colon cleansing plus the 58 other things one has to do before one even starts the daily injections, made it clear that this is pure snake oil. If you don't lose weight on this impossible regimen, Trudeau would probably claim that you didn't follow the protocol."
1,Snake Oil,This book is filled with the most recidulous nonsense. It has got to be one of the biggest scams of which I have ever heard. Don't waste your time or your money. (It has one star only because Amazon will not let you submit without it.)
1,better have some bucks,"while following the so called protacol might indeed result in weight loss, not many can afford it. to do this while working a forty hour week or more is next to impossible if you are to follow it exactly which it states many times is critical. this program will run easily into the thousands of dollars if done properly, basically a weight loss plan for the non working rich. to bad he doesnt mention any of this in his tv ads."
1,dont buy it,THIS MAN IS CRAZY HE WANTS YOU TO INJECT YOURSELF WITH SOMETHING THAT IS NOT LEGAL IN THE US DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,This book is unrealistic!!,"The thing is, im sure that kevin trudeaus remedies may work in allowing you to lose weight However, the thing is that the treatment plan he suggests are for people who have not only an incredible amount of free time, but alot of cash as well. If you are a working person forget his suggestions of 30 colonics in 30 days, forget the suggestion to replace all the showerheads and faucets with a filtering system....buying only organic foods, expensive oils and getting thai massages thrice weekly.He also suggests retreat locatuions such as austria and switzerland. i love the guy but i cant afford his porograms at all...and i make 60 grand a year!In other words this book is best suited for those people who have alot of money and dont have to work. dont waste your time or hard earned cash unless youre one of the privileged few. Again i love kevin trudeau but come on! Juicing works better and faster anyway. so does the master cleanse."
1,Waste of money!,"I can't believe I was suckered into this book! I even pre-ordered it! It truely is the most unrealistic diet I have ever heard of! Colonics? HGH injections? Organic EVERYTHING? Who would do any of it even if they could? Don't buy this - it's garbage. I'm sticking with Weight Watchers!P.S I am not the ""same poster"" as someone earlier suggested that all of the negative comments are coming from nor am I from the ""diet industry"". I'm a housewife and mother who bought Kevin's ridiculous claims and regrets it."
1,"Yeah it's helpful, if you can leave the country and get the treatment!","I think his information on the food industry is informative but the ""cure"" he is talking about includes injections that you cannot get in this country legaly because the FDA did not approve it. He could afford to fly all over the world because he is rich, but most people do not have the means and the money to jet set to these places that leagally give the injections that help make the weight loss effective!.Hey Kevin, next time you write a book like this, you may want to think about the people and if the ""cure"" is affordable and within their reach. I do not support Jenny Craig or the other popular weight loss ""rackets"" but at least the products are with in reach of the people where they live."
1,Yeah Right!!!!,"This was a complete joke. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone! It's great for a good laugh, but if you are looking to lose weight ~ this book is not for you! This guy must be out of his mind!"
2,Basically not possible,"Has some good nutritional information. Phase one recommends a fortune in dozens of supplements. I am not willing to ingest that much of the unkown into my body. Phase II is not feasible. There is no way I could get the HCG RX nor could I travel out of the country to get it. The FDA does not recommend it for weight loss, therefore I would be unwilling to take the injections. Even if I did, I cannot give myself an injection into the gluteus maximus unless I am made of rubber.I can see why The author talks about kings, princes, celebraties and socialites getting great benefit from the injections as they probably are the few who could afford it. There are healthier and more inexpensive ways to manage weight. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I is overhyped and misleading. I would ask for my money back, but I'm sure it would not be forthcoming."
1,The weight Loss Cure,I thought it was a real rip off on the author. The way he talked on TV you can go into a drug store and what you need to make it work. man the stuff he said is not in our stores. And how many people paid for the book and can't get anything out of it. I will never by anything from him again. He is a total rip off to the eveyday person. And you can tell him that. thanks Cindy
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"In an ideal world where people had access to human growth hormone this might work. Also, not everyone has a health food grocery store on their corner to only eat organic foods. And who can afford it? I know I can't."
3,Obviously!!,"Most of this book is REALLY obvious!!! And then it has a few questionable ""treatments"". They may work but finding someone to preform them? Yeah, right."
1,Best laugh I had all week,"Check it out at your library if you want a good laugh. Hey, you might even laugh some of your behind off, I sure did."
1,Total Waste,I would have rated it 0 stars if that option had been available. This was a total waste of money. I did learn something though. I learned to ALWAYS read the customer reviews before ordering.
2,"Dr. Atkins, where are you?","Kevin is no expert on weightloss, although he did lose weight and does have some good ideas. But if you really want to lose weight, just eat less, get some exercise and stay away from fad diets. Please don't ask your doctor hard questions. Overall, save your money on this offering from Kevin."
1,Disappointed,This plan would be so hard to follow unless you had lots of money and could go to the place where someone could do all this stuff for you. No one could do all the protocal required on their own--it would be a full time job. I was very disappointed with my purchase of this book and so was my friend who ordered with me.
1,"Trudeau's ""Cure"" Is A Rip-off!","I saw the infomercial and bought my copy of ""The Weight Loss Cure."" I anxiously read every word as Trudeau says, only to find this guy is certifiable...and weird. If I had the riches he has from all of the sales of this hype, I could afford to go to doctors in other countries and buy my weight loss as he has. I threw my new copy of this book in the trash. Trudeau is a theif."
1,Secrets You Don't Want to Know,Maybe these secrets would help people lose weight... just not anyone who dislikes needles or daily injections.
2,Not so great,"This book doesn't really tell you anything practical you can use. I agree that we should eat as much organic as possible, but you don't need to read a book to tell you that. The shots described....who know where you can even get them. Don't waste your money on this one!"
2,"Some good, some not so good","His phase 1 of the weight loss protocol had many good instructions for losing weight. However, his weight loss protocol included an injection that cannot be obtained in the US except through the black market. It also features a 500 calorie a day meal. This is just not good nutrition and should be avoided. However, by and large the phase 1 of the weight loss protocol features such good things as walking briskly for 1 hour a day, drinking plenty of water, eliminating sugar, etc. Just doing those basic things will get you a weight loss if done consistently. Evelyn Lyerly, certified nutritional consultant with Health Strategies Today."
1,"Oh, no.","Please, God save you if you are gullible enough to buy something by Kevin Trudeau. If the fact that Kevin Trudeau is a convicted felon and has NO professional training or licensure in healthcare is NOT a big red flag for you, then go ahead and buy this book. Otherwise, please exercise some common sense and steer clear of this 21st century snake oil salesman."
4,"Very intriguing, but a little hard to do all the necessary things for this weightloss protocol","I think this book is on the right track, but seems a little difficult to follow the protocol outlined unless you have lots of money to buy the supplements and necessary procedures. It came in good condition."
2,Poor mans dream,"In the begining of this book it says this was for the rich and famous,Guess what nothing has changed to get the cure you would have to be rich to go thru all the steps it calls for, This is not for the average person you will need some bucks so if you don't have them don't waste your money on the book like I did.BJ CO."
1,Don't waste your money,"It is a complete waste of your money. There are so many inconsistencies in the material. Trudeau gives great interviews, but his book is very impractical if you want to lose weight."
1,rip off artist,If you order any of this man's books and try to get your money back you are out of luck. I've been trying for over a year and the only response I got was an attempt at charging me for another book. Guess I was lucky and got that charge stopped.
1,MAJOR SCAM,What most laypeople do not know is that the 500/cal diet has been studied hundreds of times and results in the same weight loss with and without hcg. Dr. Simeon's diet and injection protocol has been tested in double blind studies many times and the results are always the same. Compared to a placebo the injections do absolutely nothing. Trudeau's book is a complete scam and most of his advice is disastrous besides being impossible. It all boils down to a 500/cal diet which causes a great deal of muscle loss and physical disequilibrium unless you are following certain behavioral protocols which have nothing to do with Trudeau's advice.
2,"Some Good Tips, But Generally Unrealistic","This book has some good tips and some sensible actions that anyone can take to alter their eating habits for the better. However, the HcG shots are probably over the top for most of us. Likewise, the sheer quantity of vitamins and supplements including some exotic purchases are simply not realistic for most people. If you could follow the program, it will probably work, but most people will not be able to sustain this program which by default makes it a poor diet.I can't recommend this book because I think that the decent tips are not sufficient enough to overcome the things a person has to do that are not reasonable."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This book is complete rubbish. If it is indicative of the author's other efforts, I would suggest you avoid them all."
1,The Weight Loss Cure by Kevin Trudeau,I got his two books hoping he had something that I could really use but there wasn't. His book is a joke. There was one thing that was a help but a person can not afford to get it. Who knows if it would really work if a person could afford that one kind of product he spoke of. He rambles on alot in his two books. To me it was a waste of money & my sister thought so to. I do not recommend any of his books to anyone. He is getting rich at our expense.
3,Better have good eyes to read this one!,"Kevin Trudeau is a hoot....you have to reeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally stretch it to believe what he writes as a weight loss regiment....Of course, I have not tried it so I shouldn't knock it!One warning is if you get the paperback...be aware...the print is very tiny...you almost need a magnifying glass to read it! Especially if you are old like me!"
4,More Info on HCG Diet,"The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know AboutI have Kevin's first two books and found them packed full of good information. And this book is no different. Kevin is a talented writer and can keep your interest in what can be somewhat boring material, and he even makes it exciting at times. Even if you aren't comtemplating this diet, the information he gives you regarding our food we eat in America these days will be extremely helpful to anyone who is health conscious."
1,only buy if you've got 3 or 4 thousand to spend,"Most of the book is Mr. Trudeau on a rant, which he is free to do.Since I'm not one of those who has remained ignorant of the poisonous processes to which the average grocery store food item is subjected, I gave all that a miss.The weight-loss procedure he finally gets around to recommending may very well work, IF you've got the extensive time AND money to spend on the 15 massages and the endless colonics (also not cheap!) and purifications of seemingly every major organ in your body. I'm afraid real and permanent weight loss will only come to you the old-fashioned way: eat less and do more."
4,It works if you are committed to losing weight. I lost 35 pounds!,"I have tried every diet there is from Adkins to South Beach, Nutrisystem...you name it, I've done it. I did not do all the extra stuff outside the protocal that Kevin Trudeau recommended and I still lost 35 pounds in 3 months and I have kept it off unlike all the other diets when I got off it. Yes you have to be dedicated and yes it cost money just like any other diet. Organic food is expensive but it is well worth it!!!"
1,the weight loss cure,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know Aboutthis book is misleading. It requires radical measures and doctor visits. forget thisbook. this guy is a snake oil salesman!
1,save your money,"Kevin Trudeau who? Save your money, or support a man who knows nothing about nutrition and weight loss and is trying to get rich fast. Save your money on a book from a professional! I recommend Volumetrics."
1,Thank you reviewers....,"This is not a review, this is a thank you to the reviewers... Saturday morning with coffee in hand, I watched this infomercial. My friend swears by one of this other books... but I never buy off infomericals, but I decided instead to go online and check it out... Everyone has saved me cash. I will not purchase this book.Anytime an infomercial witholds key information to entice a purchase is a warning flag to me, which is why I came to Amazon (which I LOVE) and saw the two stars and 300+ reviews.Its no consolation to the people who spent the money, but my thanks anyway for saving me from the misery of this book."
1,50/50,"There is good news and there is bad news. The good news is, Amazon was good to me. I received the book the next day I ordered it. Great condition as promised. The bad news is, I was extremely disappointed in the book. The author falsified information during the infomercial I watched one night. He said it would be an easy diet, BUT he did not say you had to get injections, etc etc. Of course you have to have the injection as mentioned in the book, it makes you nauseous! Throwing up bc of it will make you lose weight. And on top of everything else, there was one thing he said to take that makes you go to the bathroom non-stop. I don't recommend buying the book. Better off losing weight the normal way, healthy diet and exercise. This diet may not be good for you, you HAVE to see a doctor to lose weight here. None of the things he mentioned sound healthy to me."
1,hCG is imposible for the average person to get,"The weight loss cure will cost you. Not only the price of the book. Kevin has a good idea yet there is no way to paractice it with out spending a lot of money. He talks a lot about big compianies making money by make you fat, yet recomends supplements from only certain compaines, which most likey help him out. Also hCG is illegal it the US to use as a weight loss. What doctor would prescribe it to you? I'm am very disapointed with this book."
1,Shut this guy down!,"BE WARY! Go to consumeraffairs.com and read all of the complaints and deceptive business practices this guy is famous for. What a loser. This guy has been around since multi-level-marketing tried to take off. Everyone check your credit card statements very closely and if you can not reach a person to cancel the subscriptions for monthly newsletters you didn't realize your were signed up for then call your state's attorney general's office and file a complaint. If the state of Texas can stop the guy who was ""selling"" free trials for that Enzyte ""male-enhancement"" crap (they are now refunding Texans and can not run their ads anymore) then other states can finally put this guy behind bars (again) before someone ends up really hurting themselves and never being able to ""poop"" naturally again."
1,The Weight Loss Cure,"The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know AboutBoy, oh, boy. Write a BIG HUGE ""S"" on my forehead for ""sucker"". I saw the infomercial and was suckered into this hook, line and sinker. Don't waste your time. Although I have no doubts this weight loss method would work, it is inconceivable for a normal human being to accomplish it. I called customer service (very rude might I add) about returning this book and it would have cost me as much to return it as it did to buy it. When I originally bought this book, it came with two other books. The customer service rep tried to sell me all kinds of other stuff that was just a waste of my time. One of the other companies actually charge my credit card for their product and to date, I still have not received a refund. WHAT A HOAX!!!"
2,not attempting it,"THis book list 60 plus things you must do in order to lose 30 to 40 pounds in 3 plus months. Which is doable without this book. I was curious to see what it was about. Well, let me tell you this, you must do so many things if you did not lose a little weight it would be a miracle. On this giant list of 60 is colonics. You must have it more than once... Not that I am against colonics but, the average person probably can not afford it. HOnsetly it basically says eat organic and you are better off. I believe that part too. Eat organic as much as possible stay way from processed foods."
2,The weight lost cure,"The book wasn't as good as I thought, it is the same text but different subject as from his other books. It wasn't much help I haven't got the products in my area that he suggest and over the internet, the web site he suggest to order from they are too expensive. I have 3 books of his and this last book will be my last."
2,Don't ask . . . he'll tell,"Not one wasted word -- the ""Cure"" probably works, BUT . . . what a hassle! Just lay off the salt, starch, sweets, dairy -- you get the idea!"
1,this book was not helpful at all!,not helpful when they tell you to take injections!! I thought it was a waste of paper and threw it away promptly after reading it.
2,The Weight Loss Cure They don't want you to know about,"I returned this book because someone else purchased it and lent it to me. However, I must say the cure probably only works best if your able to go out of the USA for a long period of time to take some sort of injections.In addition to the injection it claims you need to use colonix on a regular basis. I have read other diet books: ""You on a diet"" by Dr. Oz which is a much better read. This books disagrees with the use of colonix. I was so disappointed with the Weight Loss Cure. This diet cure was not going to help me."
1,The Worst,This is worst weight loss book I have ever seen. It is very missleading. I don't see how anyone can follow the course this book suggest.
1,Thank goodness for the return policy.,"This book is a waste of time and money. There is nothing in this book that the public doesn't already know. And the money you would have to spend on all the medical tests and procedures ,( colon cleanses and such), and the foods and supplements are way out there. This book is a money making scheme.Dianna Kuhns"
1,What A Rip Off!,"This author never EVER gets to the point...leads you on to purchase more of his products....well I have 2 of his books which I will be donating. I do not recommend this book, you'll be unhappy w/the purchase."
1,The Weight Loss Cure,"I will NEVER order another book or product endorsed by this author. I feel ripped off. The key element of the ""cure"" is not available to most people. From someone who has struggled all her life with excess weight, I feel that Kevin Trudeau is preying on people desperate to lose weight. Very few of us can afford to fly to Germany to get the key ingredient of the cure, unless we are like the author who makes money off the desperation of others."
1,Some interesting facts about this,"As I sat here this morning reading reviews trying to decide whether or not to purchase this book, I'm listening to Sports Reporters on ESPN. They start talking about this hormone HGH (human growth hormone) that everyone is talking about having to inject for this plan of Trudeaus. I stop and listen about how this is being banned in sports and can only be purchased through a perscription, and what they are doing to test athletes for it. I don't beleive I'll take the chance on buying this book, or trying to find a way to use this so called ""weigh loss cure""."
1,Scam,More blathering from rip-off artist Kevin Trudeau. Hasn't he made enough money off the eager-to-be healthy public?
1,Trudeau's a con artist,"Trudeau, in his book touts himself as presenting the ""answer"" for anyone who wants to lose weight. I found his book to be a hodge podge of information gleaned from a variety of texts. The information contained in this book is questionable and Trudeau is NO doctor or scientist. Don't waste your money!"
3,Lots of pork in this book,"Very repetitive in his delivery, not to mention that most of what is in this book is common sense. I expected to hear something new and exciting but is really just a ""flush your body"" program. Save a few hours and just buy a colon cleanse product."
2,common sense..nothing more,This author should be arrested for selling garbage to consumers and touting it as the end all of weight loss miracles.
1,Who could do this??,"While it is possible that this weight loss plan could work, who could do it? The requirements are overwhelming and restrictive to the point of being impossible. I was very disappointed that this really isn't something that the average person could accomplish on their own. Plus it is potentially very expensive requiring colonics, myriad supplements, injections by a doctor, etc. The reason we aren't all doing this is not because ""they"" don't want us to know about it, it's because for the average person it would be way beyond reach, even if they wanted to do it which seems unlikely."
1,Threw it away!,"I have only rarely actually thrown out a book, but did with the 3 I got by him. I had ordered them in a special deal and was so disgusted with all of them and his paranoia & smugness, I put them right into the dumpster. Plus, of course, the main reason was his gobbledygook rantings and raving."
1,Most complicated ever,"This is the biggest disappointment that I have ever had in a book. The diet as presented can only be done under a doctor's supervision, using a drug that is not legal for weight loss in the USA. I have never seen anything as complicated as this program. It would take much money and time to do this program."
2,Not An Easy Cure to Follow,"I think this book as his others are very vague in some areas, and he presents such strange things to do that the average person will be frustrated with. Some of the things he asks people to do could only be followed by a fanatic.I should have known from his first book that this would be disappointing."
1,Misleading,"I ordered this book after seeing the infomercial. It is very misleading, his solution is to use a drug available only overseas. I returned the book within the time period and after calling the 800 for a return code. This took 15 minutes of hold time and I didn't get my money back. Not worth it!"
2,Big Disappointment,"I was not very happy with this product. It was not as advertised. Most of the information requires medical examinations, expensive trips to get treatments and expensive treatments. The common person could not use much information in this book. I would not recommend it unless you have lots of money to spend on weight loss; like to travel; and lots of time to do so."
2,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You To Know About,"Phase 1 was very useful in that it got me to use probiotics, vitamin E, Omega 6, etc. However, it would have been nice to know that I was going to have to go to a physician daily to get injections for Phase 2. Except for Phase 1, the rest of the book is completely useless to me. I guess the author assumes that everyone has seen him on TV. Not the case, so I had no idea that I would be required to see a physician for daily injections. Because of the remote area I live in, my physician is 47 miles away, and he is not willing to take part in this."
1,The Weight Loss Cure they Don't Want You to Know About,"Kevin Trudeau should not be allowed to falsely advertise this book. He liedabout it being easy and inexpensive. You can't easily get it at the health food store. The main item to change your metabolism is not available in the US because it's illegal. He is just scamming everybody and getting rich off of it. That's why I returned my book for a refund. I wouldn't even rate this book, only in the minus column,I had to give it a star or it would't take my review."
1,The Weight Loss Cure that no one can follow,"I bought this book with the hopes of permanent weight loss. Of course I had hopes of a quick fix, but I was also willing to work for it. After reading about 1/2 of the book, I gave up. I didn't even start the regimen which included colonics & hormone injections. The process may work, but any normal person wouldn't have the time or money involved to be successful with this."
1,Get Lypo or a Gastric Bypass...it will probably be cheaper.,"This guy wants you to give yourself 2 enemas a day, eat only organic, bounce on a trampoline, take tens of supplements a day, avoid florescent lights and air conditioning (you'll have to quit work for these 2) and give yourself injections. GET REAL!!!"
1,"C'mon people....use common sense! There is no ""cure""!","This guy is making ridiculous claims that are completely false in order to sell books to people desperate to lose weight. We ALL wish there was some magic cure, but there is not. Period. The sooner people accept this, and start eating less and exercing more, the sooner crooks like this guy will go out of business."
1,FDA declares HCG fraudulent and illegal,"This whole program is based on HCG and this quote is all you need to know now: As of December 6, 2011, the FDA has prohibited the sale of ""homeopathic"" and OTC hCG diet products and declared them fraudulent and illegal"
1,Snakeoil anyone?,"Before anyone buys this book, they should find out more about the author. Unlike his other books, that were filled with bits of knowledge that most people could find by spending a few minutes on the internet, this one promotes a practice that could be dangerous. Trudeau and his secrets are nothing more than a shiny bubble of wishful thinking, fascinating for a moment, and then nothing. It's amazing how he circumvents the law, but I read where they got him a time or two. What does he care about fines and legal fees when he makes a fortune by duping the public into thinking there are miraculous cures that are hidden from us, but at long last he will reveal them. Laughable, but also very sad. So many desperate and hurting people sending their money to this_____________. Fill in the blank."
2,What Kevin Doesn't Want You to Know...,"When you get this book you will discover that you need to take weekly injections of a prescription drug called hCG (WOW!!!!). You want get this drug without visiting a physician, who most likely will be unwilling to prescribe... This is just the oposit he used to advocate in his book Natural Cures... Is he serious or is this just a ploy to make money? In any case, if YOU are serious, look for better sources. The best for me is the book titled ""Can We Live 150"". Check it out and decide for yourself!"
2,No cake and no eating it too,"I'm not going to question whether this cure works. All I know is that the book went from Trudeau saying ""I tried every diet in the book and told myself I wouldn't do another unless it was easy, inexpensive and enjoyable"" to telling us the cure is finding the clinics that will inject us with a controversial remedy and and not eating anything that doesn't come from organic stores and not even to drink tap water because of all the toxins. Maybe this ""cure"" works, but it is neither easy nor inexpensive. I won't mention the utter lack of enjoyment it would entail (no more eating out, no more public swimming pools, no more flouride toothpaste, no more Advil etc). Buy this book if you are ready to change absolutely EVERYTHING you know about your life thus far. He may have found some miracle, but to ""sell"" it as simple and easy to implement, as he does over and over in the beginning of the book, is absolutely asinine."
1,Horrible and unrealistic!!!!,"I was a big fan of Kevin Trudeau until now!! I am soooo disappointed. Whathe said in his last book regarding natural cures made so much sense, so Ijumped at the opportunity to purchase a preview copy of the Weight Loss Cure.What a joke!!! I wasted $29.95 on this piece of garbage that I probablywon't even be able to give away. The library probably won't take it. Theplan talks about HCG injections and a diet plan to follow which is toorigid. My only question is: Where in the heck am I going to get these HCGinjections and how can I convince my doctor to give them to me??!!!! Notonly that I have to get them everyday??!!! Sorry Kevin, for the averageperson, this is too unrealistic, and right now I don't have the money tofly to Germany, find this clinic and go on the program. I am verydisappointed with this book. To all who are reading this: SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,No wonder he won't tell you on TV!,Wish we had read these reviews. We would never have bought it! No one can follow this!
1,blah blah,"I think it is a trap like all the other books he has written, thinking your getting something for your 30 dollars, but when you read it he repeats himself alot. not really saying anything. then he has you go to a website to find the items he's telling you will help and it costs you more. its a vicious cycle. try actually helping people and stop trying to get rich off the desperate."
5,This Diet Protocol Works! You Cannot Argue with Success!,"Do a google search on ""HCGSupplies"" or ""HCGDietInfo"" to find out where you can get everything you need to make this diet work for you. Stop reading the negative comments and make something happen in your life. Google for ""Dr ATW Simeons"" and learn what this plan is based upon before you buy Trudeau's book. This information is SODID GOLD and it's FREE!!! I've lost 135 pounds in 6 months so far. What are YOU waiting for?"
1,This book was written with other intentions,When first starting to read this book I thought that something was wrong with the writer and why someone did not catch the fact that he kept repeating himself just a few sentences or paragraphs apart. It seems like he was trying to brainwash you and make certain words and phrases stick in your mind. Then as I and others I know who have read the book believe that this book was written and is being used for a political point of view on several sectors of business rather than try to help or offer help in ones weight loss struggle.Very disappointed and will never buy another book by this author
2,"Ok, but you have to have Lots of MONEY for this plan!","I think this is a good book. Unfortunately, you have to have lots of money and free time to work his plan.I think getting colonic hydrotherapy every other day for a month is ludacris! Oh, and thai massages 5 times a week?who has that kind of time and money!"
1,Not a realistic way to cure oobesity,I read this book and I don't know anyone who has time in their busy schedule to go to the doctor every day for 30 days to get these injections he suggests. This weight loss cure may work for those who don't have a job to go to every day and have time to go to the doctor every day for 30 days. Not me. This supposed weight loss cure is not realistic because not just anyone can do it. Now I understand why this was originally done by the rich and famous.
2,natural cures to weight lose,"the book gives you a diet and what to do, but in the us its hard to find a doctor that will Rx it for you"
1,And????.......,The book is not worth buying. It takes forever for the author to get to the point. I would have been better off buying a South Beach Diet Cookbook!!!!
3,The Weight Loss Cure,"I did the diet. It was GREAT. The book was informative, but a lot of whining about the FDA and the government. But it also had a lot of good information.If you want to loss wait fast and follow the rules. Believe me it WORKS!But you cannot (read my lips/words) cannot do it half way. You must do what it says and go to a good health care provider to get the injections."
1,dont waste your money,"Zero stars should be an option. This guy is a great salesman. The ""cure"" he says is available for everyone is a growth hormone that can be procured in Europe. Available for everyone? And safe?? I dont think so. He made it seem like the ""cure"" was something you could get from a grocery store. Not so. Dont waste your money on this book."
2,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know About,"Very costly to follow the program since many purchases must be made in order to make the diet work. I never would have purchased the book had I known this as well as the fact that injections of human chorionic gonadotrophin must be taken each morning during phase II. Unless you are willing to buy all the necessary ingredients and take shots, I don't recommend this book."
1,Don't bother,"First things first, I did not read this book. I'd have to be an idiot to. I'm a physiologist who is a fan of infomercials (I think they are a riot). I have listened several times to his infomercial about his other ""secret cures"" book. It is unbelievable hogwash designed to fool the most ignorant and gullible. Trudeau is the classical snake oil salesman. Don't waste your money."
1,The Weight Loss Cure YOU don't want to know about,"Highly repetitive. It took 225 pages to say what could have been stated in 40. I would find it impossible to follow the dietary advice of the author----try having an enema every other day for 30 days---I don't think so! The book is much like the infomercial. Lots of talk but not much else. The diet secrets might work if you owned a Health food store and an organic farm. Ever heard of Q-Link, E-Pendant, or Biopro for neutralizing electromagnetic chaos? And, get frequent massages along with liver cleanses, clean your colon, do a parasite and heavy metal cleanse and a powerful Candida cleanse. Not for me."
1,Not what they make it seem!!,"I bought 2 of these books ater seeing the program on TV. After reading my copy I was very dissapointed. It is filled with marketing for other books written by the same author. At the beginning of the book, it appears like a really big secret was going to be revealed, but long before the middle of the book, all hopes dissapear as a looong list of things to buy and do's and don'ts appear. It is no different from the other diets. There are also a lot of contradictions, the auther claims that it is inexpensive but a calculation of the cost of all the items and services required to start this diet way exceed the cost of any diet I have ever done. He also makes recommendations for the supplements needed to cleanse the body, however those too are drugs!! I trully regret buying this book as a gift for someone before reading first. I was too dissapointed in its contents to finish reading it so I don't know whether there is anything useful in those pages."
1,Just Hype,"This book was on T.V, Radio, ect. and after reading the book , my thoughts, another quack ripping us off."
1,Ads are misleading,"This book is interesting and the ""protacol"" may even work but what they don't tell you when you see the ads is that it depends largely on the injection of a drug not available in the United Staes and numerous(15) colonics at at least $75 a pop. So if you can afford a thousand dollors to have your butt cleaned out and travel to Germany(Trudeu's country of choice)and get back through homeland security with your 180 injections of a drug that can't be sold here then you're good."
1,Disappointment,Think Mr. Trudeau is flying on the success of his first two books. Thisone is a huge disappointment involving a very complicated regime forweight loss including medically supervised injections etc....things theordinary person is not equipped to deal with. Shame on him!
1,"It's a ""ZERO"" if only Amazon allowed it","The bottom line secret in this book why you WILL lose weight is that it is a 500 calorie per day diet! You don't need an $18 book to tell you that you will lose weight on a starvation diet! Forget the hormone shots that Mr. Trudeau has you taking; it's the 500 calorie diet that will do it, if you can stay on this diet long enough. I tried to give the book and the author a chance to sell me on some unknown magical formula that would be a revelation to losing weight, but all he sells you basically is a starvation diet!"
1,SAVE YOUR $$ HE MUST BE GETTING A CUT FROM THE SPONSERS OF ALL THE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS YOU'LL NEED!!!,"First of all, Mr. Diabetic whose life was saved by this book -- if you would have just listened to your doctor, you could have made the changes without contributing to this guy's bank account. He must be making a cut from all the websites he has listed in his additional products you'll need. Yah -- I'm going to the doctor everyday for an hcG shot and enemas. If you change your diet intake, and do exercise, of COURSE you're going to lose weight. Save your money and put this slimeball into bankruptcy. Please. I only wish I had had reviews to read when I purchased this book, I would have saved slapping myself. This guy feeds into everyone's paranoia about the illusive ""they""."
1,Not an easy way,In this book Kevin Trudeau wants you to believe that this is an easy cure...however it is one of the most expensive inconcievable ways I have ever seen to lose weight. Basicly he asks you to live your life in shell without air conditioning and without florecent lights no cell phones and go totally organic with ALL foods this only after you have to get the 30 colon cleanses at $80 a pop and get your hands on HGI shots that you would probably have to fly to Germany to receive because very few Doctors in the states will administer this hormone injection. Totally not doable unless your rich. I have turned to eating more organic foods and do feel better but thats all I can afford at this point. Sorry Kevin you marketed this book falsely.
1,Trudeau a True Ripoff Artist,"This book just like his others, is this scam artists attempt to suck people into another one of his schemes. He is no longer allowed to appear in infomercials..so to get around it and still keep selling his snake oil .. he now has a woman selling worthless books. People please, don't let this crook (Trudeau has already been convicted of fraud) steal anymore of your hard earned money. Disgusting Scumbag !! I had to give it 1 STAR to write this review otherwise 0."
3,Disappointed it's embellished,"Was very disappointed to read in the front of his book that he embellished it -- I was seeking a book that was accurate about an important topic, HCG, as I truly believe it gets to the cause of overweight/obesity, it is a ""cure."" Since he embellished his version it didn't do anything to help this field get more (accurate) information out there to thousands who will be interested in this way to lose weight."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I have never left a review for a book before, but after buying this one I just had to warn others not to waste their money! This book isn't some new weight loss miracle, it's just another book about the hgc diet. The difference is this book insists on several elusive and expensive supplements in addition to frequent (as in every other day) colonoscopies and daily massages. If I could afford daily massages I could just get a personal chef! You can find all of this information online for free, all you have to do is search information about the highly questionable hgc diet. If that diet works for you, that's fine, but after paying for the shots and ""special soaps"", etc., you definately don't have to waste your money on another book telling you everything your hgc-shot-administering doctor will tell you."
3,The weight loss he STILL doesn't want you to know about,"I got this book in excitement of learning some natural ways to lose weight and keep it off. As I started resading I realized the Author basically repeats the same things over and over telling you you will lose weight but not how. Not till like the last 12 pages or so does he tell you what to do but not how to do it. Then the list is so great it would take alot of money, time to research and hours devoted to it, that it's not worth it. I gleened a few things i knew would be good for me but over all the book is just a redundant ""you can do it"" infomercial."
3,Another hCG diet reading supplement,"This book is interesting and does have merit along with others written by successful hCG dieters, tho' not absolutely necessary for success with the protocol. I happen to like a lot of K T's suggestions with re: to detoxing as part of a life long strategy for healthy weightloss maintenance, and a healthy lifestyle in general as well."
1,Don't buy from this convicted felon,"If you are stupid enough to buy anything from this crook, send me a message - I have a bridge in Brooklyn that I'd like to sell you."
1,Why didn't I think of that!!,"This book is something that shouldn't be for sale in the USA. I should have donated $20.00 to a good cause. How can this author write of a CURE for weight loss, knowing the injections, that are part of the mystery of the cure, are not allowed in the USA. Shame on you all for selling this to an unsupecting consumer. I hope this review stops any other consumer from getting bilked!!!"
1,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know About,"This book is a scam. Now if you watch the infomercials Trudeau is onto writing books about making it rich. Guess he knows what the world wants to know, how to be thin and how to be rich! He plays us right into his greedy little hand and feeds us the biggest bunch of BS! Don't waste your money. I read the first few chapters. Nothing made sense at all. Rambling on in verbage to hide his ignorance. I'm sure he is laughing his way to the bank!"
1,stay away!,"Do not buy this book, it is a sham! It talks about using all kinds of herbs that are not readily available or not available at all. I bought a copy and regretted it; it is sitting here gathering dust."
2,Not All It's Cracked Up To Be,"The plan outlined in this book isn't possible for the ""ordinary"" person. The cost, not to mention the logistics of getting to the dr. every week just isn't feasible."
3,It was informative,I know some people think this writing is unethical but at least it gives a person an outlook on what is going on in the gov't and Pharm companies.Sure there are things that are unattainable in the US but at least it gives awareness of what not to eat if that person was oblivious.I found it very interesting.Eat less excercise more and you get great results.
1,Not what it seems,"This author has written a book on natural cures, but I don't see anything natural about this weight loss cure. Part of the ""cure"" is to get a high colon cleansing, approx. every other day of a month, using colon cleaners and getting injections. Eating certain foods, especially organic, is a good part of a healthy diet, but I do not believe in these harsh colon cleaners or injections."
1,Kevin Trudeau DOES NOT Write 'Doonesbury',"The sure fire cure for weight loss is eating lots of food. Duh. I remember when I was losing weight, I just started eating a bunch more food. He is WAY off the mark here, folks."
4,you need to read the whole book,"I felt like some of the other reviewers before I finished the book. I felt ripped off before I finished reading the whole book. KT puts all the info in the book you need to follow the plan. Some of the answers(like where to get the secret ingrediant) are hidden through out the book.HE makes an excellent point by writing:why aren't people around the world fat and Americans are? The world populations eat all the things we aren't supposed to. Fat, carbs, protein, people eat all this and still don't have the weight problems like we Americans do.I'd like to add, if you tried other things and nothing works, what if this does? If you're thinking of stomach surgery or some other drasitic measure spend the money and buy this book.I have been tring to follow the early recommendations. Some of the cleansing has been eye opening. Give it a try.Is this going to be easy? Is anything? But, it could change your life.Be open to new ideas. Good Luck."
4,An infectious Afro-Latin tour,"At first listening, I was pleased with this recording--but it didn't truly delight me. Then, during subsequent plays, I noticed myself dancing around the kitchen to its lively melange of infectious tunes. For me, this is a delightful tour of places where life is lived to a bright, rhythmic score..."
5,You will not be disappointed with this buy.,"Hungry? Looking for something to fill your audio Plate? Well, ¡Kalinda Kaliente! dishes up succulent sounds from the Caribbean and South America. Covering music from Brazil, Cuba, Dominican republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico and Trinidad, yow will have to push your plate/cd Player away... You will not be disappointed with this buy. You may need to take a nap after such a full meal though"
4,Very Cool & Interesting CD,"Ok, I admit....I'm one of those Madonna fans who wants everything to do with her, and this CD is no different. I can say, however, that I was pleasantly surprised by this album.The RPO plays Madonna's music very well and I was all alone whilst listening to it, and I found myself singing along without noticing (and plus...there are no lyrics on here, so that's a testement at how close things are.)So get the CD and throw a Madonna karaoke party, it'll be excellent!"
2,Not up to the RPO's standard,"I like many of Madonna's songs, and also the orchestral music, and I'm a fan of the RPO also. I bought this CD with hope to hear something better than those of tracks on the CD. For me, this time the RPO had poorly done its job."
4,It's a soothing way to enjoy Madonna's music.,I'm a huge Madonna fan. This cd allows you to enjoy the music when you want to try singing yourself or if you have company and need to talk but need that background filler. This is a great cd to have in your collection.
4,Mind Numbing Black Metal,I don't suggest buying this if you have heart problems!This album did three things for me:1.) Put me in an altered state.2.) Introduced me to my ancestors.3.) Changed my life entirely...I joined the Church of Tjolgtjar.Not just basic USBM this is different than anything I've heard
3,real?,"the depth you know is being abused, used for the deal with no distance: damned near, real? FAR on the other side, real freaky"
1,Guess you need to be blunted,"Not worth it even if it is two cds. Talk about boring. Every song has horrible keyboard drum beats and sounds very amateur.Better to stick with the heavyweights of the genre... Shadow, Logic, Beatjunkies, etc."
5,"In one breath - Street smart, elegant, and sensual----","This is hip hop and jazz at it's most hypnotic. Feel ethereal sex, streets and beats. Very relevant and connected, as it moves the genres up and out."
5,Smooth jazzy beats with hipnotizing hooks.,"There are so few DJ's out there that understand the musical beauty of hip hop and jazz without messing a song up with lyrics. The jazzy beats are music for your soul and that's where DJ Cam lets his talent flow. Dj Shadow also understands this and I hope they can one day work together. In ""Mad Blunted Jazz"" you will hear layers of original sounds and beats that will turn any task during your day into a pleasurable experience. The Song ""Gansta Shit"", is a musical masterpiece. When you hear the way those chimes hipnotize, you will understand the power the music has over you."
5,The best for disposals.......,"Roebic #GDC Quart Garbage Disposal Cleaner is so fantastic that I bought a whole case of it. I love the smell and it keeps the disposal running great. You need to use it at night, though, as it has to sit and work for five to six hours without the water being run. In the morning your drain is freash and clean and works like brand new. I'll keep buying it as long as they make it...I'm a very satisfied customer!"
3,It''s okay,"I have other videos of Kelly Galloup streamer fishing on the Madison River. None of those areas were in the video so Galloup withheld vital information. I was hoping for more, disappointing."
5,The Rosetta Stone of Meaning,"The Geometry of Meaning is a remarkable book, ambitious and insightful. Mr. Young walks the reader through the geometric relationships established in our understanding of things and ideas, while progressively moving towards his description of a ""Rosetta Stone of Meaning"" - a 12-fold map to overlay on our understandings. The Geometry of Meaning examines object/subject relationships, Aristotle's Four Causes, the equations of physics, The Zodiac, and much more."
1,Arthur Young Helicopter,"Although Arthur Young may have designed the first bubble helicopter....don't forget that Oszkar Asboth, a Hungarian, was the actual INVENTOR of the helicopter!"
2,dull,This book was really boring. It is one of the only books I was not able to finish reading. I feel that I hardly know the characters at all after reading about 3/4 of the book. Everything is so repetitive that I felt like I already knew what was going to happen next.
3,Good Live Album Spoiled By Poor Vocals,"This is a good live album let down by one crucial fact - Steve Walsh's once golden vocals have deteriorated badly, so much so that he can't even hit the notes in his own songs any more. And this really detracts from what is a decent live album and one much better than the album the concert was meant to promote - In The Spirit Of Things (see my review on this site).As it stands the album is far superior to the awful Live At The Whisky and features an overall performance far in excess of that.If you want to hear what Walsh and Kansas were once capable of spend your money on the truly incredible Two For The Show - which I called the best live album of all time in my review on this site.Unlike Live At The Whisky this album is worth your money and it contains decent live versions of some of the only good songs from In The Spirit Of Things.Recommendation to buy."
2,Altogether disappointing,"Being an old Kansas fan (from Song for America's release) and having seen them live four times in their heyday, this CD is truely a reminder that ""things ain't what they used to be."" Steve Walsh's vocals, once had a range and clarity that few could match, but they have deteriorated to a flat harshness that does not do justice to the songs. The lack of violin on most pieces removes that essential 'Kansas-ness' from the music and turns this into just another guitar band. If you want to get a flavor for the musical richness and quality performace that Kansas displayed live, check out 'Two for the Show'."
4,This flat out rocks!,"Kansas, recorded live without a violinist? Sure, because, as drummer Phil Ehart noted, ""we had Steve Morse."" This King Biscuit show from 1989 balances Kansas classics and tunes from their then-current ""In The Spirit Of Things"" album, all performed with energy, precision, and obvious fun. Everything works, especially ""Point Of Know Return"" and the extended ""House On Fire,"" featuring twin guitar leads, Morse's grand guitar arpeggios, and singer Steve Walsh's masterful keyboard work and engaging stage presence. Even Kansas standards like ""Paradox"" and ""Dust In The Wind"" sound great in these violin-less live versions, thanks to Morse, Walsh, and the band's outstanding musicianship. There are many reasons to get this album -- because the excellent King Biscuit chronicle of Walsh's other band, Streets, isn't enough for you, or because with Morse, all things are possible -- but the best reason is that it flat-out rocks. Good show, guys."
3,its ok,"When I got this cd, I was very happy. I listened to it for about two weeks. I found every song catchy, but at the end of those 2 weeks the cd started to annoy me. After the 2 weeks the songs became too catchy and too poppy. Also their bridges aren't that good. In the songs, the verses and the choruses are good, but when the bridge comes I just wait, annoyed, until the chorus comes back. I give this cd 3 stars because it is a cd that I can go back and listen to the songs I really like but I can't sit down and listen to the cd all together without getting annoyed."
5,great,"If Weezer was around in the 1980's, this is what they probably would've sounded like. The songs are all catchy and they can be listened to over and over. It's hard to pick a favorite song, but I love ""Who Are You?"", ""Backseat"", ""Missing Piece"", and ""Now You Know"". I love this cd and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Not a good CD .... but a GREAT CD!!,"As a long time Buffy fan, I was thrilled that this CD was going to be released and even more thrilled when the soundtrack arrived in the mail a couple of days later. Amazingly fast shipping from amazon.ca!!I agree with some of the other reviews that parts of the edited out dialogue and sound effects were essential to the songs but not to all of them. I'm pretty sure that most fans who own this CD has own the 'other' version as well ^_^ so all is good.Anthony Stewart Head (Giles) and Amber Benson (Tara) shine very brightly in this CD and their songs were sung eloquently. The other cast members also sung with distinction.The extra song tracks were also a bonus to listen to. Definitely worth the $$$If you're a Buffy fan then you can't go wrong by buying this CD!To Joss Whedon and to all those who make Buffy The Vampire Slayer a success.....more please.....and thanks!"
5,Great CD,The music on this CD is fantastic and from one of my favorite Buffy episodes EVER. The sound quality is suberb and the lyrics/vocals are far better than I would expect from a teen drama.
5,Best DVD collection ever!,"Any Buffy fan will love this collection. I watched the entire series over the summer and it was great seeing them all one right after the other. It gave me an appreciation and a deeper understanding of the series that was harder to get when watching each week. The commentaries are great, and the extras are fabulous. I am so happy to own this collection."
5,feelin it all over again,"even as a die hard buffy fan , ""once more, with feeling wasn't one of my favorite episodes, that is until i bought the soundtrack.every song just comes alive , and makes you want to sing along.i was pleasantly surprised at the vocal ability of sarah michelle gellar and james marsters, but unlike the buffy the vampire slayer soundtrack that has alot of familiar tunes, you won't hear these songs on the radio.anyway,if you love the show, then you should enjoy this."
3,Soundtrack CD not as good as Music in the actual episode,"I am very surprized that nearly 300 people reviewed this, and not one person seemed to notice that the songs on this CD are not exactly the same as what actually appeared in the Once More With Feeling episode. Some of the songs are slightly edited, have different mixes, even different vocals and the major thing that disappointed me is that there was some important dialogue that was deleted that they should have kept as part of the songs. For example, Dawn's line ""The hardest thing in this world to do, is to live in it"" nor is the part where Sweet (the Demon) realizes that Buffy is Dawn's sister and says something to effect ""The Slayer, bring her to me, I want to see the Slayer Burn"" was also omitted.Get your Koombayayas out - 76 bloody trombones... (that wasn'y included either....Play the DVD - the soundtrack is much better."
4,"Oh, well...","This Cd is alright...okay, it's awesome somehow. There are many good tracks, many funny ones and many crap ones as well. I love ""Under Your Spell"" by Amber Benson (Tara), she's talented, if you don't wanna buy the CD, just check out her song because it's good. The lyric is nice and all, I can definitely feel love here in this song, the video clip is also cute. Anthony's songs are good too, check them out. Sarah Michelle ain't that good at singing but she managed, so are the rest of the team. Don't like James Marsters' voice."
2,it's probably better if u've seen the episode,buying the cd without seeing the episoide makes the music kinda confusing make sure u like the music from the episode before u buy it...
4,Very good,"Of, course, you will enjoy this the most if you have alreadyenjoyed the TV episode. But my bet is that, even if you did not, you will find this a very pleasant musical ride. The songs are good, orchestration tight, the Buffy actors do a reasonable job singing, everything's in the right place. I simply love the album, which by the way I was lucky managing to download it from Suprnova (by the way, the site was shut down yesterday. Dammit!)"
3,Great for Buffy fans,I got this CD or my sister when se was a Buffy fan. She liked it ! Perfect for any fan of the Buffy series.
4,Once More with Feeling,If you liked the episode you will like the soundtrack. Of course it has a different feel to it but it's one thing to watch it and another just to hear it. It does have some slow points but it's a nice touch to add to a Buffy collection.
5,This album is worth the wait,"Very glad to finally get my hands on this. I really enjoyed the episode from last season(I'm wondering now if there is anything Joss can't do well), and had some of the songs playing on my own interior soundtrack -- couldn't get some of them out of my head. Standouts here are ""Under Your Spell"" where Amber Benson gets to show off her amazing pipes, and ""Walk Through the Fire"", a powerful tune. Anthony Stewart Head also betrays an incredible singing talent here, especially on ""Standing"".An extra treat is the inclusion here of some of the orchestral music from other Buffy episodes by Christophe Beck. I wish they would put out another cd compiling his work for the series; if Xena could get numerous soundtrack cds, we deserve at least one more for Buffy.And to top it all off, the cd booklet has a cover and illustrations by comics art god Adam Hughes.Do yourself a favor and get this today. Grr, Aargh."
5,Well mixed CD,"Like many Buffy fans, I burned my own CD from MP3s clipped out of the musical episode before this CD came out. At the time, I promised myself I would buy the ""real one"" when it came out, and I recently did just that. I'm very glad I did. This CD is great quality, and contains the complete songs without dialogue, extraneous sound effects, and other nonsense that creeps in when you try to clip songs out of the TV episode. Moreover, some of the words were not very understandable before, but are now clear as day. It helps that the producers have access to the original master tapes to work from, instead of trying to get the songs from the broadcast version of the show. The quality difference is like day and night. You won't be sorry you bought the CD.Because the musical show had very little spoken dialogue, you can experience the entire episode again just by listening to the CD. Great fun for Buffy fans -- highly recommended."
5,A very pleasant surprise!,"I don't watch Buffy. I never have....until I heard there was gonna be a musical episode. I was blown away! As a big fan of musicals, this one is DAMN good. The vocals are great for a cast that doesn't sing and the songs are perfectly written. I wish there were a DVD of the episode to go with this album. Tracks that stand out are ""Under Your Spell"", with a Sarah MacLachlan-ish sound to it, ""Through The Fire"" which is one of the best ensemble pieces I've heard, and ""Rest In Peace"" which truly shines. If you like musicals, then you should definitely get this one!"
4,Pretty good,"I think the fact that this CD has been favourably reviewed in the mainstream press says it all. The general consensus is that its a fine example of the musical genre- particularly when, in theatrical terms, the latest successes seem to revolve around regurgitating old musicals or constructing new ones based around the back catalogue of a long defunct pop band.As mentioned, there's only three cast members who can actually sing (but the whole point of the episode is people singing unintentionally, so it works). Amber Benson, Tony Head and James Marsters acquit themselves well (Tara's song is definitely noteworthy, as is Gile's...sorry, Spike's song is pretty [bad] if you're not watching the episode). Joss Whedon makes me sick...how much talent can one guy have?"
5,Buffy the Musical,I really love this soundtrack.It has a few extras besides just the music from the musical and it's worth the price.
5,buffy music,"Purchased this for my daughter, who is a huge fan. Particularly loved the episode with this music.Excellent item."
4,Some New Talent,"Hmm... that is what I, as well as I'm sure many others thought upon first seeing the much-anticipated musical episode. But after watching it about 10 times, and listening to the CD much more, my Hmm is now a Wow!!! Anya turned out to be a talented singer, as well as Tara. Of course Spike was hot singing rock 'n' roll (but then again, he's always hot). There were some low points, such as Buffy's voice -- which wasn't too bad considering she is an actress, not a singer!! And Willow's voice- hey, there has to be a reason she only had about 3 singing lines the whole show! Otherwise, very unexpectedly great! Only other complaint is, where's Anya's song from Selfless, 'Mrs'??"
4,Buffy rules!,"They could have kept the sound effects from the show, but overall this is great! An excellent companion piece to season 6 DVDs, when they get released."
3,Mix is terrible,"Content is great, but whoever mixed this thing should be shot as it sounds terrible."
3,Dialogue Please!,"The songs sound great on this cd but my only complaint is that no dialogue was used. It would have made the songs sound more like they came from the episode if for example, the dialogue between Buffy and Spike was used before he started his song to her. Without the dialogue, it just sounds like the different characters performing songs for no reason. Also the dialogue between Buffy and Dawn wasn't used on the Gift score. It was nice to get more score music on the cd though. I hope that a score cd containing all of the music from all the seasons will be released soon. Score cds have been done for the X-Files, Xena, Hercules and countless other shows. Why not Buffy?"
5,And They Call it Buffy Love,"Hey...these songs are good. While some voices are decent in a sweet folks-y way (Tara and Giles), some thin and tinny (Buffy herself), these are well composed songs. Very ""Rent"" like in a somber, urban tone. But it does use irony to be a traditional musical in some instances. And the lyrics are as clever as the show's dialouge.A must have for one who enjoys the artistic risks the tv show takes."
5,Wonderful episode of a Classic and Perfect TV Series.,"This CD is a must own for all Buffy Fans. The soundtrack to one of the coolest episodes from The Buffy series is an absolute joy to listen to. Amazon lists The ""Main Title"" track as track #1 on the CD which is where it should be as that's where it appears in the episode, but that track is actually #19 on the CD, which I thought was odd. If you import the album into iTunes, you can reassign the track numbers and put ""The Main Title"" in its correct place as track #1."
5,Remembering Buffy,Well done songs from Once More With Feeling. Also contains some good instrumental tracks from Hush. A great buy for all Buffy fans.
5,Give me something to sing about...,"Let me say, first of all, that if you buy this expecting a broadway quality piece with stunning vocalists and complex orchestral arrangements, you may be disappointed.However... This album is very worthwhile if you are a big Buffy fan! This contains every song that was in this episode, and overall it is fantastic! I respect joss for doing this episode and putting so much effort into it. Plus... It's fun to sing along ( which Buffy asks you to in something to...)!I must say that the voices are not amazing... But I really have respect for all the actors for actually singing. Amber benson, Anthony head, and the man who played the demon, however, are exceptions. They all have great voices! Sarah and Emma have alright voices, and so does nick. However, I'm guessing Allyson hannigan asked to not sing much (she has only 3 lines). But overall, the album is great! As I said... Great for Buffy fans!"
5,Joss Whedon is a genius,"Obviously, this CD isn't for everyone. It's meant for fans of the show and/or people who appreciate musicals. Anyone who enjoys this sort of thing, however, will not be disappointed. The songs are very catchy and the lyrics are often amusing. Aside from the musical's songs, there are also some scores at the end from other critically acclaimed episodes and they're excellent as well. You can see the scenes playing out as you listen to them. The cover art alone is almost worth buying the CD. This is something ""Buffy"" fans must own. As usual, Joss Whedon has given us another excellent piece of work."
5,Don't hesitate!,"I've been waiting for this forever and let me tell you, it was worth the wait. What could be better than watching James Marsters? Hearing him sing! OMG! James and Tony's vocals are incredible, as well as Amber Bensons. The whole cast sounds great, but I have to say my fav track is James' ""Rest In Peace"". It's a great album, even more so if you love Buffy. Do yourself a favor and take a listen."
5,Awesome Soundtrack,"WOW!!! This is a great a soundtrack for one of the best episodes of the best show on television. Sarah Michelle rocks as the lead of this all around wonderful cast. The two highlights of this CD are clearly ""Wish I Could Stay"" with Amber benson and Anthony Stewart Head, and ""Something to Sing About"" with Sarah Michelle Gellar. The classic marriage song, ""I'll Never Tell"" is done quite well. ""I've Got a Theory"" is wicked hilarious, and ""Under Your Spell"" is PERFECT. This CD is a reall triumph for the Buffy creator, Joss Whedon. THIS ROCKS!! BUY IT!!"
5,THE MAN IS A GENIUS!!! IS THERE ANYTHING HE CAN'T DO?,"Mr. Whedon never ceases to amaze me! Been waiting on this for a while, listening to my own little 'bootleg' copy. This was DEFINITELY worth the wait. Thank you Joss, for giving me 'something to sing about!'"
5,Awesome sound quality!,"If you like the Buffy musical, you'll love the soundtrack. The sound quality is unbelievably improved over the best I could get from my home theater setup. The liner notes are pretty amusing and, best of all, include all the lyrics. If you're even a casual Buffy fan, you gotta get this!"
5,Hardin is God,"Dave Hardin is a relatively unknown talent whose time has come. Too long a well kept secret in the Tampa Bay area, Hardin is the total package. From his poignant lyrics to his beautiful guitar work, his unpretentious presentation has the ability to suck the listener into his world and evoke the emotions of this simple man living in a complex world. As someone who has seen the man perform live, I can attest to the fact that this disc is the next best thing to being there.Hardin takes the best qualities of James Taylor, John Prine, Neil Young and John Mellencamp and weaves them into a complex tapestry that is uniquely his own. The music is honest and unpretentious, and hits you in the gut. You feel it as much as listen to it. Order two copies, because you are sure to wear the first one out!"
5,A fascinating story about one woman's life,"This book had personal meaning for me as it is the story of my great aunt. Growing up I had always heard about my family's trips to Idaho to see Frances. I laid in bed as a child as my grandfather told me stories about hunting bear with Frances and the great times they had. My eyes were filled with wonderment, much as they were after I read this book. It is a true story and I'm proud to say that she was a relative of mine. To read all of the different tales I had heard growing up put together in one book was great. I have lent my autographed copy to many people and all have enjoyed it as much as I did. It truly is a wonderful story."
5,I spent time under the walnut tree with Frances and Gretchen,"I met Frances in 1984 while clearing the Salmon River trail in April for the Forest Service. It was a wet, rainy trail hitch and we spent days cooking over pitch wood fires because pitch was the only thing we could get to burn. Pitch burns with a sticky, black smoke so after days of cooking over these fires our skin and hair were sticky and black. We headed over the pack bridge from our camp at the Jim Moore Place to visit Frances one rainy morning and she had kettles of water warming on her stove, all prepared for us to wash our hair! It took many kettles of water to wash and rinse our hair that morning! She was such a lady, clean and neat, yet so strong and couragous to live her life the way she believed it should be lived. She has always been my hero. I never tire of re-reading her stories and we loved it when she'd write about us!"
5,amazing,with evey show i see they just keep getting better and better. if you ever get to see attic of love live you will not be upset. they put on one of the best shows i've seen. there energy and the way they get the crowd into every song. there hard edge with the sounds of the flute are fantastic. i can't wait to see them perform again and for there new album to come out. this is one perchase you will not regret.
5,being you,"Amazing and unique is the only way you can describe the music of Attic of Love. Amazingly tight, powerful, and profound. To see them live is an experience you won't soon forget!"
4,Minn Kota MKA 26 Minn Kota Drift Sock,"I purchased this drift sock in early spring. I have only used it a couple times in my canoe to help slow my float while I fish. It is very effective and very durably made. I would maybe purchase again, but it seems a little overpriced for being a simple piece of material with a couple straps sewed on."
2,Worst Lego Design,My kids love Legos and we have so many but this one has no durability whatsoever. It fell apart a day after we got it and the parts have been sitting in the box ever since. It needs some type of support base with it to help hold the board together. My 10 year old could not put this set together and got extremely frustrated. What's the point if they have to wait for their parents to put it together.
2,Very predictable and boring!,"I thought that this book was not very entertaining, I didn't even read most of it because it was so tedious, I just skimmed it to get to the very predictable ending, don't waste your time, but its sequel ""A Time to Dance"" is definitely a great read."
4,Predictable and sappy but good,"This was the book I picked for our book of the month club based on a friend's recommendation...We have been reading a lot of spiritually uplifting books lately and I wanted to just read something easy and light...it was a good book, but easily predictable...easy to get into and follow along....I am reading the sequel to it as I have heard it it better than the first book...Stay tuned..."
2,Not custom fit,"Works ok but has to be cut to fit, carefully. No upturn lip to hold water. Picture not of this item."
2,Misleading advertising information!,"This DVD is actually a documentary of some ""chiller theater"" convention of fans. I thought I was ordering the actual video of the old Chiller Theater shows that were on TV. The description of the item is unclear about this."
3,Good concept. Poor implementation. Horrible customer support,"Well first of all when I got this software I absolutely loved it. Spent few days and it really worked (I learned few hundreds words or so). Nice user inteface. Very simple (sometimes to simple, it could benefit from few advanced options). But none the less I liked it. When I started to advance and type words faster I discovered few problems like: program will hung if you type to fast (or if you turn cards to fast), some minor (but very annoying problems with editor). So I mailed couple feedbacks, request, etc. explaining the problem in details, asking whether fix/update is available and stuff. Hardly get any responce. They basically told me to reinstall it.It worked fine on Apple though. Looks like new version (3.5)fixed problems I had, and added some additional features. But customer support sux big time. (5 for idea, 3 for implementation, 1 for customer support)"
5,A great resource for self-studying,"I like this book because it assumes no prior knowledge in Calculus. It starts from the basic topics e.g. functions and develop to advanced topics e.g. vector and tensor calculus following a logical development.Besides, the book has a lot of computer graphics which make reading inviting. Also, there are numerous examples in each section which make the text easy to understand. There are too many other features and I can't mention each of them."
1,"Avoid, get the later versions.","What a big difference formatting makes in a textbook! The actual content between this textbook and the later versions is the same, by that I mean almost literally down to the word, but the later versions are so much easier to read! I think it's something to do with the lack of spacing, poorly done diagrams and a general feel of text slapped around the page without much formatting. Also there is a lack of questions compared with the later versions. I gave this a one star because you should really use the later versions instead of this one. But incase you can't get a copy and are forced to use this one, well I pity you, though as a consolidation, the content is solid. By itself, I would have given it two stars."
3,Used to be a good book...,"I used the 6th edition for a lot of the begining studying on many calculus subjects. While this book is easy, it still teaches you the stuff. You understand the material, not just get these mechanical processes to apply to the freakishly hard problems that you get. I would suggest looking for the 6th edition though...The 7th edition isn't very good at all, one of my professors had an extra copy of this book so I got it... and well.. It wasn't very good... Look around in your local used book store for the 6th edition... That's what I recomend as a student."
3,Calc book,the book was shipped and was in the shape i expected... but there was not CD in the book. i was under the impression that both the book and CD would be sent.
5,My 10 year old daughter loves this book,She likes that it is from the dog's point of view and that you get a good sense of what it is like to be a dog.
5,Great children's book!,"I purchased this book by accident and fell in love with it's character Jack the Border Collie and his quest for the perfect home. A heart warming story where Jack runs away from the spoiled child who dresses him up in doll cloths, the ultimate humiliation for a sheep dog. His adventures include hooking up with the Goat Man. I recommend it highly....!"
2,Not the best,This camera is ok but I've used much much better ones. It seems cheap. The zoom does not always work. It is slower than I would like.
2,Vivitar 8400,"For the most part, this camera takes decent pictures. I chose it because it uses AA batteries as opposed to having to plug it in and recharge it after every use.The only complaint I have about it is that when I record a movie, a set of two AA batteries is drained in about 2-3 minutes. There is a slot for an AC adapter, but the product doesn't come with an AC adapter. The adapter is nearly impossible to find online. I say ""nearly"" because I haven't been able to find it on a handfull of online retailers. I am beginning to think it is just a fabled legend. Vivitar UK sells it online, but it is listed in British currency. As far as purchasing it from a US retailer, I have not yet found one."
3,Addendum to Previous Review,"I bought one of these a while ago, before their were many alternatives. I am sure there are probably much better products out there for similar prices. Some of the previous review I would disagree with. First, my chief complants are: 1. Very cheaply made 2. Atrocious button layout 3. Inability to include longer file names 4. Inability to burn CDs with over a 192k bitrate. I am not quite sure of the exact configuration that the previous reviewer was using, but I know for a fact that you can burn CDs at least up to 4x (or at least I have and have never run into a problem).Bottom line: It works well and has good sound quality (compared to my portable mp3 player). I would think there is better on the market by now.....but if the complaints we voiced don't bother you, it's a good product. Oh, by the way, you can record stuff with a mic and using CD-RW media (although this feature is completely useless to me)."
2,"Okay, until something better comes along","It is finicky, cheaply made and poorly designed, but beyond that it is a usefull machine when you get it figured out. Mine would overheat until I started using a different AC adapter than the one provided. I never got the 8 hour battery life another reviewer mentioned. I use rechargeable batteries now. I burn 10 hours of music to a couple of cd-rws, occasionally change this mix by reburning the cd, hook it up and leave it on random all day, like a personal ad free radio station. I don't ecommend it for use in the car, not that mine skips, but it is difficult to hit the right buttons, and it usually has to be reset at a red light. I like the idea, but will definately upgrade to a better brand when a worthwhile player comes out at a good price."
1,...,"When I got my player, it had somthing rattling around in it. It turns out it is a plastic nut that came loose. The player only works if it is not being moved, AT ALL!! And it is very choosey about the non-MP3 CDs it plays. I sent many messages to customer sevice, but they never acknowleged my existence. This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever bought."
1,First MP3 CD player could have been MUCH better,"I commend this player for being the first, but everything else about it isn't very good. It skips a lot, if you want to find a song at the end of the CD (alphabetical?), you have to skip through all the tracks one... at... a... time. Can't skip folders ect. Mine still works amazingly, but only because I just use it at home and never move it or even use it much. I've left non-rechargable batteries in the box while it's plugged in... BIG mistake! the stupid thing tried to recharge them and leaked battery acid (i think) all over the place. Get a different player, there's much better ones now."
1,"Piece ""o"" ...",I bought this ... and it never played a song without skipping. after about 3 days it simply stopped working. I would recommend the Philips player.
1,Average product worst custmer service,"When I opened the new Genica GN803 Tavarua Portable MP3/CD Player it had black spots on the LCd screen. Also some fuctions like 5 play mode were not working. I immidiately contacted the custmer service through e mail. NO RESPONCE !! then I tried calling them ,NO RESPONCE!! At last one fine day I returned this to the dealer. I had to spend my time and moeny doing all this. So I definately suggest you 'DONT BUY THIS' or buy a headache pill with this .at least you will not feel the pain!"
2,I'm gonna sell it!,"I got this player about 7 months ago from England. I was so happy about having a mp3 cd player at this cheap price. But I was confused to burn cds and I didn't understand the process very much, so I wasted 4 cdRs. Even after I learnt how to burn, it still had probrems. It didn't play some of files and skipped them. It was really really frustrating! And those buttons are so small, so nobody else couldn't understand how to usethem, I always had to stop the car when I feel like listening to the other stuffs while I was driving. In 2 months, the cover paint was peeled and it came to be like a real old machine as if I've been using it since I was born(1981...). And now, it doesn't work at all. It doesn't even play an ordinary AIFF cds. I leave this complains because I came here to find the new mp3 cd player! Don't waste your money!"
4,Cool product,"This is one of the great innovation machine today. Every music industries will cry when this goes popular, the only problem is that it doesnt have a text scroll for viewing what song you are playing and batt life only last for 5 hr on duracell."
4,An excellent start,"I bought this for my husband when this was still the only item of its kind on the market. I imagine there are better products out now, but he's still quite happy with it despite a few minor elements of poor design, like the arrangement of the controls. As soon as he got it, he tried playing a CD he got as a freebie from mp3.com, and that didn't work, but as soon as he burned a CD of his own with mp3 files, it worked just great. I also bought a car kit to go with it, and we only got it to work two out of about 10 times, but I don't think that was the Genica player's fault."
5,Right on track - common sense eating,"Having written any number of books on health I fully agree with this book. We really are the end product of what we ingest into our system. Eat bad and you'll feel bad, and worse your health will deteriorate. Eat well and you'll feel well, and best of all in a relatively short time your health will improve, dramatically. This book shows in simple terms what steps you have to take to live your best potential life. You don't have to be a nutritionist or hire one to lead you toyou best possible health. With thsi book you'll find your own way."
2,Scant instructions,"I have been quite disappointed by this cookbook. The instructions are insufficient for ordinary cooks. Critical details are left out with the assumption that you will somehow just know what to do. Do I fry those onions? And what at what temperature? And some things just don't make sense. There is no way that 2 cups of chickpeas are going to translate into enough soup for six, no matter how small your serving size is. We ended up with three tiny servings. And it tasted awful! Also, cook times for beans in liquid are excessive -- at least for those of us with naturally soft water.I love the idea of this book, and all the chatty info about beans in Italy. We are looking for more bean recipes, and this seemed like a great option. If you are looking for bean recipes -- not necessary Italian -- Madhur Jaffrey's World Vegetarian is a better bet. Though her cook times are way too long for our soft water too. But the recipes are declicious, and easy to follow."
3,good item...but pricey after shipping and everything.,"Well, the straws work great, but after all the shipping handling...it came out to over 10 bucks."
1,At your own risk.,I wouldn't clean my rear end with the pages of this worthless book. Very incomplete. Awful awful awful index!!!! You will look for the most simple items and they will not be there. This must have been a high school project or something. You would be better off taking the truck apart and writing your own book!!! Stay clear and save your money!!.
3,review of the repair manual for 1997-1999 dakotas,"The book was perfect for me. It explains mainly how to serveice your vehicle, and that was what I was looking for. If you are wanting to get into details of the 97-99 Dodge Dakotas, you may want to get the Chrysler book instead"
5,Great prices,Saved me $20.00. For the price I was ahead before my first repair maintenance tips made easy. AutoZone wanted twenty dollars more
5,Super Mini Binoculars,"A great product for traveling, compact, light and easy to focus. I take them everywhere I travel. I highly recommend."
1,little church aroun the corner,"the quality in unaceptable. the picture is very bad, probably from a tape master in vhs. to see it is not a pleasure! don't buy it!!!!"
2,Disapponting,I was very excited to have bought these bulds. But in less than 3 weeks one of them blew and the warranty said should have lasted a year.
4,"Great dance music, the energy is international","As an english-speaking American, I bought a cassette version from a street vendor for $5 during a vacation to the Dominican Republic. One of the best $5 I ever spent. This compilation of the ""electric"" merengue (as opposed to the classic accordion-based merengue) is a high-energy, turn-it-up, put-your-dancing-shoes-on good time. Anyone who enjoys salsa or mambo should add this to their collection."
5,Knock my socks off,"I saw these guys live. They were amazing. I got the cd. It's good to see music ""real music"" coming back. The Bass line is hard and on point. The guitar is the most soothing and hypnotic sound I have ever heard, the drums are wild and pure. While I listen to this album I wanted to get drunk have sex with a hooker and piss on my bed. Damn I love rock n'roll. Oh see them Live cause as great as the album is there live show is 10 times better. If thats even believable. A must have cd. Maybee the best Rock album of the year."
4,Twang & bang!,Great box set! Could have done without the moving sidewalks stuff. Enjoyed the included flip book! If you are an old fan looking to supplement your vinyl or a new fan looking to get up to speed...this box set is for you. The enclosed booklet also provides some history and insight into how that lil ole band from Texas came to be.
5,There is a difference from the original,"If you're like me and have every ZZ album already, and are sitting on the fence on whether to shell out the $ for this box, do yourself a favor and head over to itunes.com and listen to the songs. There is actually a pretty big difference in the remasters, especially the earlier stuff like Brown Sugar and Chevrolet, and in stuff from Degüello. The simple, straightforward tone of the remasters is what cinched the purchase for me. The unreleased stuff is there too for the listening. You decide. Also available from itunes.com, a legal download of the entire album for $20 less than this site."
5,Chewy Goodness,"I must say that this collection demonstrates the most impressive improvement via remastering that I've yet experienced. It's almost like hearing these tunes for the first time.If you like the Top, this is a worthwhile investment. I've nearly worn it out."
4,Almost Everything You Need,"Finally, good sounding ZZ Top on CD. This has almost everything you need. The only downfall is that they concentrated so much on the latter albums the first record has just a few tracks and really could have used more representation. Also, it probably could have been cut down to 3 CDs as well.Otherwise, a fine set!"
4,Blast from the past!,"This is a great collection of all the best bits of ZZTop. Loved the first three CD's, but the fourth was just OK, hense the score of 4 out of 5. The little flip book of the boys swinging their guitars was a blast, and the booklet of the history of the band was a nice touch. This collection has great recordings of some of their best work, guitar playing being excellent. Great for a party, especially of old rockers like me and my friends. Old rockers never die, they just get fuzzy hearing. So we turn it up really loud!"
5,zee history of zz through warner years,"this cd by far traces the history of the band. the remix from the orginals was exceptional! i liked the moving sidewalks on the disk providing early works from billy, but it should also included early works from joe 'dusty' and frank if any recordings that they made with any band they was associated with. the band over thirty years has evolved by evidence from hearing this album from disk 1 to 4 even though over the latter years they have brought humor into their songs. i liked that especially tv dinner song. in closing if you was invited to joe, billy, or franks house you would be amazed to what they listen to believe me you would."
2,It All Goes South!,"I know it's unfair to ask Prince to give us another great songin the vein of ""Purple Rain"", ""The Holy River"", ""Do Me Baby"",or even ""Soft and Wet"" but at least come up with something listenable. I just wasn't feeling this dud at all. Hopefully,though he'll take an 360 degree turn for the better next time."
1,What Tha????????????????????,"Sorry, guys. But this records which is currently being given rave reviews--which is good for Prince--can not under any circumstances compete with Prince's classic material.The musical compositions, in my oppinon, are just simply dull and tired! None of it posses the ELECTRICAL SHOCK of his older music--NOT THAT I AM NOT UP TO SOMETHING NEW! But Musicology just does'nt get it. At least not for me.This record sounds like a man whose had everythihg, been everywhere, had every girl that most guys could only dream of. And there's nothing left to fight for because he's already had it all. And it shows in his music. HE'S NOT HUNGRY ANY MORE. That's Prince's main problem! It's not having it. It's getting it. That's the punch. That's the kick. Getting it not having it."
1,Crapology,"Yes, you were good in the 80s, emphasise WERE. Now you have obviously run out of money and are trying to get stupid little 12 year olds to get you some. Not interested loser."
2,"I love Prince and all, but what was he thinking?","If you like the old Prince ""Little Red Corvette"", ""When Doves Cry"" and you arent comfortable with change, THEN DONT BUY THIS CD. Simply said, I DIDNT ENJOY ANY OF THE SONGS."
1,"Sorry, but this album is awful","I really like Prince, and was expecting a lot better than this album....There is not one song on this album that I can really get into, his older stuff is so much better. Don't waste your money."
1,Sucks!!!!!!!,"I WOULD GIVE THIS ALBUM A (.5) BUT AMAZON WONT LET ME! PRINCE YOU ARE VERY, VERY TALENTED. BUT DON'T YOU EVER MAKE FUN OF YOUR 80'S RIVAL MICHAEL JACKSON. WIERDNESS ASIDE HE IS WAY BETTER THAN YOU! PEOPLE IF YOU WANT A BETTER ALBUM THAN GET DANGEROUS BY MICHAEL JACKSON."
4,Great CD!!! Prince is back!!!,"I've been a Prince fan since High School and I've listened to his sound evolve...Musicology is wonderful...if you REALLY listen to the album, you will hear a very talented musician...if you listen to the album expecting a remake of the Purple Rain days, you will be disappointed. Accept Musicology for what it is...a wonderful collection of songs by a musician who has grown within his music.""A Million Days"" is a good listen as well as the the title track Musicology.The Musicology concert was AWESOME!!!"
3,I see what's happening,"they're trying to hype him up with this ""comeback"" album the way they did with madonna's ray of light. Prince is a talented cat who's looking finer than ever today, but he lost me after the early 90's, and this CD sounds no different from the music he did since he became a symbol. I liked the directions N.E.W.S was going in, but this album is completely different. But if you're a prince fan of the music after his commercial peak, you may enjoy it, he is very talented and a legend after all."
4,Musicology....A Decent CD,"This is a good cd. It is better than Emancipation, which to me was his worst cd. There are highlight tracks which include Musicology(a la Housequake), Call My Name, Life O The Party and Reflection. The best track on the cd however is What Do You Want Me To Do?Buy this cd, you will not feel it was a waste of money."
4,"A great upbeat, yet modernized version of funk!","When an artist usually says there going to do an old-school funk album, most are not from that era. But with this album, the artist knew what they were talking about. I remember this cd, got a little buzz on the radio, because Prince was trying to do something commercial again. Musicology is great album, with a lot of great beats, and guitar rifts. My favorite track was the last one reflection. I also found Illusion/ Circumstance to be interesting. If your a prince fan this is def. the album for you! It's a classic Prince CD highlighting what he does best, funk music. Most of this album was very enjoyable for me to listen to, and didn't feel as if it were ""The artist formally known as prince"" doing something weird that wouldn't be enjoyable to listen to. If you get my drift. If your into old school r and b then this album is a must have!"
3,Prince: He Came Back For This,"The last Prince studio album I purchased, was ""The Symbol Album"", that back in about 1992, I would believe, so with that said, I figured I would give ""Musicology"", a chance, but besides ""Musicology""(the song), and ""Cinnamon Girl"" there really isn't anything to get you excited about this album, it is a big let down, one song after the other just sounds too similar to the next. And I did listen to it from beginning to end and this cd is just to bland, not enough to get you going. My favorite song on the album is ""Cinnamon Girl"", and ""Musicology"" and that's about it. This album pales in comparsion to what I think is his best album ""Diamonds And Pearls"", that is a complete album, with no hit or miss, but ""Musicology"" is a big misfire, from one of the better artists' around, this is a big letdown. The album gets a (C-), it could be much better, try again Prince."
2,MUSICOLOGY?!?!? Try crap music 101!!!!,"I got this album because I went to the show (which was much better than his Emancipation tour where he played little to no guitar!) and had a great time and saw that Prince was actually back doing what he does best. Unfortunately, I missed out on the free CD so I went out the next day and bought it. I didn't mind cause it's Prince and all the reviews I read on the album hailed it as one of his finer works since Purple Rain ( I should have known better listening to a critic! ). I played this CD three times and I'm still trying to figure out what the devil these critics are talking about! This album totally blows,the beats are horrible, and the lyrics are too corny! I don't know what Prince was thinking on this one but I hope that does a better job on the next album. I'm a HUGE fan since his career started and will continue to be but I'm have to start buying his albums in the bargain bins if he keeps this up!"
4,"A Creative, Talented Brother","Musicology is an all-around terrific CD. The tracks are really diverse.I can see why artist like Alicia Keys sees Prince as a mentor. They realize as an R&B; performing artist...the importance of real music including playing musical instruments and actually studying music. All of this is evident in Prince...even to a lay person like myself.Prince is mainly Funky here but you get some other sounds as well. One of my favorites is Call My Name. This slow, sexy song has pertinent words with a smooth style. In Musicology, he takes you back to when artist were ""true"" artist, even naming the ones that we all respected the most. He does, however, make a quick little jab at the King of Pop on one of his tracks. (hehehe)Chris Rock said it best. Back in the day folks use to compare Prince to Michael Jackson. Well guess what?!?!?!PRINCE WON!!!!"
4,some 80s funkiness...,"I don't know whether or not I'd go so far as to say that this is Prince's best album since Sign o the Times. I own just about every prince album and CD going all the way back to For You. Like many Prince fans, I have always appreciated his freedom to create different music. However, every now and then I wish that he'd put out something with a bit of his 80s funkiness. Musicology delivers this sound. Prince fans of this era won't be disappointed!"
4,Surprisingly Solid Music from a More Mature Prince,"I'm frustrated with the negative reviews this album is getting from some people. This is not Controversy, Purple Rain, or Sign O' The Times. It is a more mature, more settled Prince without alot of the raunchiness that those other albums contained. Does that mean this music is uninteresting and doesn't kick a**? NO!This is a funky and fun set of tunes that are actually more reminiscent of the old Prince than is obvious at first. The first two tracks (title and Illusion, Coma, Pimp, & Circumstance) are plenty funky! Cinnamon Girl takes me right back to high school, cruising with the windows open blasting Raspberry Beret. Is it one of Prince's best songs? No, but it's fun. None of the songs on here make bold statements like some of Prince's past work did, but he seems content to create solid music on this set. I keep thinking I'll take this CD out of my car player, but I haven't yet. This is a good sign for Musicology."
2,"Great Artist, So-So Album",Say what you want about Prince but he's still the greatest recording artist ever. I have to regretfully say that this is the first Prince album I didnt really care for. In my opinion I think his recordings lately have been suffering from bad mixdowns. Everything sounds bland and he's not using much reverb anymore. He's not putting his magic into the tracks anymore. I see Prince is trying to educate with his music but sometimes it gets too preachy.
2,prince aint that invincible,"prince is a legend in his own time but musicology is a title that doesn't live up to it's name on this bland CD from prince. I prefer 1999 and sign o the times, and who could ever forget purple rain. Sony wasted energy on promoting(oops I mean giving out free copies) of this CD when it could have been invested in greater talent *cough* michael jackson *cough*. I gotta agree with one of the other reviewers that Dangerous is awesome"
2,I love you but what....where... Come back,"Prince is the most talented artist in his league.I dont have enough adjectives for him. In short I am hurt. This CD is for another fan base. I have been a Prince supporter since the days of International Lover and Lady Cab Driver and he makes you feel love and want to love somebody. The only thing that felt like Prince was Call My Name.I will always love what his style,expression, creativity and what he has done for music but his changing was like having a lover breakup with you and you not see it coming.This is not worth the time it took put it on Disc. Let's hope he comes around but I think we have lost him for good."
