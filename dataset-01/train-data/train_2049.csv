1,"Sucks,...move on.","Im a HUGE fan of KC's first two albums. Unfortunately, this one is a coaster. Part of the problem is in the engineering. Often the music smothers the vocals. The other part of the problem is the songs just arent very good. It almost feels like the music was recorded seperately from the vocals, and they were paired together by some random means. I respect the fact that this is the album Kelly wanted, but for me its just a horrible waste of talent. She was obviously aiming for edgy, but she hit 'bad' right on the head."
4,"A little dark, but a great album, a great singer!","Kelly Clarkson fought to have her own way on this album and you can tell. The songs are all very personal. A lot of them have to do with a bad breakup and the aftermath of that. I'm sure the public would like to have heard more of the perky pop American Idol that they are used to, but her style is her own and I am a fan.Hopefully next time around, she will be in a better place in her life and things won't seem as dark as they do in this album."
3,Not what I was expecting,"From all the talk surrounding it, I was really expecting a loud, angry rock album a la Alanis Morissette style. I was disappointed to find only a couple ""let it out"" kind of bitter songs on this album and the rest I found sad and mournful. An entire album? Really Kelly? It started to depress me and then just bore me. Had I known, I'd have just downloaded singles ""Never Again"" and maybe ""Hole""."
2,Maybe too fast on this one Kelly,"Love Kelly (especially Break Away), but this one seems to be maybe a little rushed, lacking a real head turner."
5,Best album by far,Her music continues to become more mature and simply better. I can listen to this disc over and over. The songs are awesome. Much more grownup than on previous albums. She has come a long way since her debut album.
5,GREAT work from our Jagged Little Idol,"Dont listen to what people say about how ""bad"" the album is, the thing is people cant accept change. Kelly will never make another album like Breakaway or Thankful. How boring would it be to have the same stuff over and over. Lyrically this album is a masterpiece. My December reminds me of Jagged Little Pill. The music clashes together well with the lyrics and its all so raw. There's no in between in the songs - theyre right to the point of what shes trying to say. My December is probably now one of my favorite albums of all time. Each song is relatable. They dont have to have strong hooks like Since U Been Gone - which was a formula song and the formula has been copied many more times by that producer. Shes not a puppet as Clive Davis tried to make her to be. Shes an artist with a real vision and a vision to have a lasting career and not a song by song career. Way to go Kelly on this release!"
4,Irvine....,"Kelly Clarkson, in my opinion, is the best female vocalist we have seen since Ann Wilson of Heart. I would have given this a 5 star rating but there are a couple of songs that are just 'ok' for me. My favorite song by far is ""Irvine"". I know that song is probably the least fave of some of the reviewers but I find the song absolutely brilliant! Way to go Kelly!"
5,Kelly Showing Real Musical Growth!!!,"This album is a great showing of Kelly's growth as an artist! I love how it is not a repeat of ""Breakaway."" Through the lyrics and Kelly's amazing voice, you can really tell how personal this is for her. I'd recommend this album to anyone who enjoys meaningful music over half of the manufactured stuff that's out there. ""Sober"" is the album's best song! Incredible job Kelly!!!!"
5,I really like this album,"I don't know why there is such negative press about an album that has some really nice rock songs and that plays as a concept album like many great rock albums of the 70's. That Kelly chose to move in this direction goes to show that she is more than a cookie-cutter pop singer. I don't know why Clive doesn't think that there are good hooks on this album. ""One Minute"" has hooks remeniscent of ""Walkaway,"" and I think that it will be a hit if released as a radio single. I believe that Kelly will go on to conquer a number of musical genres, including country (after watching her with Reba on CMT Crossroads).I would recommend this album to anyone that enjoys good rock and one of the truly great voices of our time."
3,Talent Trumps Image,"Kelly Clarkson far outshines her pop contemporaries on this cd. Mainly because she can actually, you know . . . sing.A lot of the songs sound like ""Since U Been Gone,"" both in subject matter of the lyrics and the full-throated, booming chorus. What caught me by suprise, though, were the softer songs on the album. They reveal the quality and subtlety of her voice.Seeing as how she got her start on American Idol, I did not think Kelly was much more than a media creation. I grouped her in with Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, and Britney Spears. After listening to My December I can see that Kelly Clarkson is in a whole other league.Kelly Clarkson is one of the few good things to come from American Idol. And while I was not completely blown away by My December, it is good enough to make me wonder about the possible directions her music may take her."
5,Haunting and lovely!,"My December is full of heartwrenching songs where you feel like you are really there with her through everything. The emotions in the song are so real and out there for you to hear, it's just so beautiful! Maybe, Sober, Be Still, and the hidden track Chivas is worth buying the album for! I would highly recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear a great collection of beautiful songs sung by a great vocalist!"
2,I Was Disappointed..,"I've been a Kelly fan since her Idol days. ""Thankful"" and ""Breakaway"" or two of my all time favorite albums, and I thought without a doubt that ""My December"" would be as well. I bought it the day it was realeased, and I'm sad to say I was disappointed. The only really good songs on the album are Never Again, Don't Waste Your Time and Judas. All the others sound the same, are slow songs, and are just plain BORING. Kelly has an amazing voice, and she's a good song writer, but this album never should have been. Every artist has an album that is a fan-least-favorite, and I think this is Kelly's.I will continue to be a fan and hope the next one is better."
2,Dissapointing.,"The word that I frist heard describing Kelly's new Album was edgey, and if by edgey you mean full of annoying guitar melody's then it is very edgey. The lyrics are fine, but they would have worked so much better if they were put the good music. Like I said the lead guitar is just overwhelming and annoying. Kelly Clarkson is famous because she is an amazing singer, and I don't want to hear her overshadowed with guitar melodies and overproduced background beats."
3,it's okay,"Kelly's new album is okay at best. It sounds sort of like Avril Lavigne, who is not half the singer Kelly is. I understand her wanting to write her own stuff and move on but there are alot of bad songs on this CD. ""Sober"" is the best song by far. I think it's one of those cd's you have to listen to alot to appreciate. I'm trying but I don't think I'll ever like it as much as ""breakaway."""
2,Nice Try,"I only listened to the sample tracks but from what I've heard, I will not buy the album because...Kelly has two types of songs on her album:1. fast,yelling angsty (tracks 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,12)2. slow, moaning angsty (4,8,9,11)I like Irvine - has a different vibe. Otherwise, all the songs sound the same to me.Not bad for a first attempt at writing some of her own songs. But they aren't good enough. Just because she has the fame doesn't mean she can use her career as anger management. All her songs sound like they are in the same key, as well. Her second album is still her best."
2,What happened?,"The lyrics are mediocre, her vocals are nothing great.... it's like she lost her spirit. Don't get me wrong, I listened to it with an open mind ready for change, but this? I'm really disappointed. All the songs sound the same, except for Sober and Irvine. Irvine almost sounds like it belongs in a cafe, which is a nice change but still not mind-blowing. In Breakaway, I loved every single song. On this, it's just... not so inspiring. Sorry, Kelly."
2,Did not work for me,"This is not to say it will not work for you, I can not say. i bought this on the recommendation of an acquaintance. I had some joint pain. I applied this several times and received no relief."
1,This item has a label that says toxic.,This item says that is toxic. DMSO is not toxic but the label says that. Take care. If fact this guy send another product diferent than picture
4,Amazing stuff,"I have been reading about this for a while and decided to try it. So far I haven't noticed any difference in my arthritic knuckles, but I only apply it once a day, if that. I forget. I did get a rather bad burn on my finger and I think that it has reduced the healing time. I am hopeful and enthusiastic about this product."
5,Roque au maximum!,"These guys make French pop fun. It's clever, has a great beat, and I really bug out to it."
1,MERDE!,"Revivalist of french garage rock. Except without any of the charm, style, or greasy wit of that genre. Trite and boring. Dependency on nostalgia to use as a platform for anything is proof of an intellectual bankruptcy...so is the music of LSC. Worthless."
3,"Nice gardens, strange grammar","I couldn't get past the poor editing of this book. Every time I saw the phrase ""such as"" enclosed in commas, I wanted to scream!However, these folks are experts and provide, in a short piece, a wealth of historical information. If you want your house to be surrounded by period plantings, this is the place to start. Regretfully without photos, which is a shame given that I googled the authors and they've created some very beautiful period gardens that they should be proud of."
3,Just got it..,"Just got it so it's not road tested yet. But just wanted to give a helpful tip. On mine on the back of the watch it looked as though the watch was a chrome tinted blue. Turnes out that it's a plastic film. If left on, this will not allow the watch to make contact with the probes on the back of the cradle used to send data to the watch. So make sure you remove this b4 the update. Software seems a little clunky and kind of made by someone who does not understand english all that well but it does the job. It's still a long way from an excellent PDA watch but it's on it's way.. at least seems to be a little bit of the step up from the casio databank (a past favorite)."
5,New bathroom fixtures,Saw item & fell in love with it but not the price. Found online with seller. Great communication! Keep me updated with tracking. So very happy I looked online!
1,Almost worthless,"It can be difficult to find a campground while on the road.1. Numbered map icons do not refer to anything. In other words you can't find campground in the text from a number on the map.2. Reference after place names in the text are worthless. They could have referred to map grid coordinates but the maps in the book contain no references along the edges that would allow one to look up 1C for example.The book I purchased says it is the 14th edition. How can a book so poorly referenced be in its 14th edition, its incredible. It is like the publisher, Cottage Publications, did not even look at the book before it was printed.If you buy this book you will be disappointed, like I was. The best thing I can say about ""Don Wright's Guide to Free Campgrounds"" is it may be better than nothing."
2,"If you're a senior citizen, don't buy this book","Most of the selected campsites are really really remote...especially if you have a motorhome. If you're under 30, on a limited budget, and love to camp, this book's for you. Unfortunately, I am 62, with arthritis, failing vision, and a motorhome that's a b*tch to maneuver. If you're in the latter category, there are better guidebooks to buy (you may have to pay more than $12 for a campsite but you'll have water, power and a dump station)."
5,Never leave home without it.,We have enjoyed so many of the camping sites in this book when traveling in our motor home. We never would have found them otherwise. It is also an easy book to use.
2,The King of Dragons,The King of Dragons is a pretty exciting book about an eleven year old boy named Ian. His dad was a Veitnam Veteran. They are homeless so the live in an abandoned court house. One day Ian's dad leaves And doesn't come back. Ian has to survive on his own in hope of the returning of his father. Strangers come to the courthouse while Ian spies on them and listens to their plans of making a kite museum out of the courthouse. What will Ian do about these intruders. I thought that this book was kind of long and it was a little boring. I would recommend this book to someone who isn't really an action kind of person.
4,Versatile,This girl's Cd is a must have in your collection. I love this girls style of music. Her voice is full and beautiful. She controls it well. She's going to be around for awhile. She's so versatile with her voice. Go on girl :)
4,Unfortunately my daughter didn't come with any instructions...LoL,"My mom suggested for me to read this book to help me with my parenting skills. Looking forward to reading every word. By the Acknoledgment, sounds like there is some very helpful information that I looking forward to utilizing."
3,Good but there is better.,"I have been a Clinical Psychologist for over 40 years. I am familiar with theP.E.T. program. It is a good program but it is not the first ""national"" ParentEffectiveness Program nor is it as good as the source from where the author took many of his ideas including his book's title.The person who is credited for the first national parent effectiveness programis Rudolph Dreikurs. He has written many books in the 1950's and 1960's. Hisbooks are as relevant today as back then. His most popular and easy to findprogram that has much more to offer than P.E.T. is ""Children: the challenge"".One of Dreikurs' students, Don Dinkmeyer, has written a series of ""Parent Effectiveness Books"" for specific age groups, from early childhood to teen years.As a parenting instructor, I would highly recommend either Rudolph Dreikurs'well written book or Don Dinkmeyer's books. Both can be purchased at Amazon.comDr. John A. AbraitisBattle Creek, Michigan 49017"
5,Parent Effectiveness Training,"Once in a while one comes across a book that is life-changing. Parent Effectiveness Training is such a book. Having read many other books on child raising, only to find that the methods and techniques are short-term at best or positively harmful, this book provides a welcome change. It makes a lot of sense and although parents may find it difficult to change the habits of a lifetime, Dr Gordon provides practical answers that we found very quickly started to yield positive results. In particular, the atmosphere in our family has changed for the better and we feel prepared for the way ahead. Finally, this book is not just about raising children. It has changed the way I look at all my interactions with family, friends and colleagues, and has given me a new perspective on the world."
5,Must read,"Any parent who is exhausted from punishing and/or rewarding and find it is not suiting your needs or that of your child, must read it!! It changed my life and parenting style forever. Most of us were raised with the mindset of using power to dominate our children. This will have you thinking a little bit deeper than the surface."
5,The best I have read,"I have read 5 or 6 parenting books and all of them had some good points and info, this one is the best in my opinion!And the communication skills I have learned are practical not only with kids but with persons of any age and education."
4,Wonderful,"This CD is wonderful-almost magical sounding. My daughter has been sleeping to this since she was 6 months and she is now 2. The first disc is instrumental which is the one we like the best - very peaceful, sweet, lovely music."
1,Micro$oft Hype,"I found this book to be more fluff about how Micro$oft technology will deliver us all from the problems with program development today. As the other reviews have stated, skip this book and go for one with more tech content than sales hype."
1,Poorly written and no examples,"I too wish I had spent more time looking at the reviews for this book before I bought it! This book is 98% marketing hype, and 2% useful examples. You don't get into writing a simple program until Chapter 16! Although the basics are in this book for designing an ASP.NET application, the examples waste a lot of time because they don't work and a beginning programmer will have a hard time figuring out why they don't work.The new Visual Studio.NET IDE is not explained at all. Without knowing how it builds projects, are we supposed to only use Notepad to edit the examples?I realize it was written using the Beta version of Visual Studio.NET, but it is definitely is going to make someone believe that Visual Studio.Net is too difficult to use to develop real web applications."
1,DON'T but this book,This book is terrible. The code in the book and on the CD doesn't work and the publisher knows that and has yet to correct it.
2,Buyer Beware,"Here is a prime example of the great service Amazon provides and what can happen when you do not use it. This book is horrible, and I have downloaded the April 9, 2002 code updates which still do not work. Had I a read the reviews at Amazon I would have saved myself some money and valuable time."
1,How bad can a book be written?,"Before this I have purchased and enjoyed a few others of the Weekend Crash Course books - never again though!There are typos, there are bad code examples, there is missing code examples, there are repeated paragraphs, there is lack of flow sometimes, there is lack of information (if you are doing some of this for the first time). I am sure that I have found close to a problem per page - and the book is about 300 pages!I cannot believe how this book got out to the shelves and worse more I cannot believe an Amazon user like myself bought a book without reading the reviews first. If you are reading this, heed the warning of myself and the other reviewers - don't waste ""your weekend"" on this book."
1,if I could give less than one star...,"One weekend to read the book, two weeks to find out the code on the CD is too buggy to even execute. I am amazed that such a horrible error could have even made it to press!Knowing of this mistake now, and knowing the publisher (Wiley) is still selling it for full price even after they are aware of this error, lets me know who I am dealing with. In good faith, shouldn't they have a note on their book site?I will never waste money on their books again.Be smart, read the Amazon reviews before buying a book for its marketing!"
2,Too much going about Elizabeth,"I thought this series was just okay. I didn't like that Tom Watts, my favorite SVU character was acting so...out of character. He and Todd were acting like big hypocrites, talking about Sam hurting Liz...like neither of them had done that in the past! And I didn't really get the point of Todd being there, anyway. Since when did he give a rat's *** about Liz being hurt. Where was he during that William White thing (besides, He's Watching You) and where was he during that Scott Sinclair episode? I get it, NO GUY at SVU can possibly get over Elizabeth. We get it. Enough already."
2,"This book was exciting and eventful, but a little complex.","Elizabeth is trying to figure out her feelings for Sam while at the same time trying to concentrate on winning the competition. Jessica is trying to face her fear of heights and go through with an event in the race. She has a temptation to drop out and run, as Neil desperately tries to talk some sense into her.This book has great spirit, but flip-flops from event to event way to fast for me. Personally, I had to constantly look back a few pages to understand what just happened. This wasn't my kind of page-turning book."
4,Superb Story Telling,"Urrea presents a gripping, humorous, and fluid story. Many of his characters are superbly realized. Thomas Urrea, for example, seems as if he could have appeared in one of Marquez's works. Yet, some of Urrea's characters do not seem fully realized, and some of the historical details seem tacked on."
5,A Masterpiece,"This is a beautifully told story about a young woman's life that blends history and spirituality in a rich landscape of Mexico's ranchland. I thought I was reading fiction until I read the author's notes at the end and realized that it was not a coincidence that his last name was the same as the main character.Luis Alberto Urrea says in the notes that although he had been working on this story for 20 years, it wasn't until middle age that he was able to bring the wisdom to the story that he needed to finish it. I think I liked it so much because I also feel that I've come to new understandings as I have matured and I believe in a spiritual life that is based on telling the truth and practicing kindness.The book is about suffering and magic and colorful characters that are profoundly changed by the events of the story.Beautiful language, beautiful visuals, very beautiful souls!"
4,A good one for Latin readers!!!!,"I enjoyed this novel. It very descriptive and really pulls you into the story. The only thing I think might be a problem....if your an English reader and don't understand the Spanish comments (which are usually repeated in English)....it might be a bit distracting. Otherwise, this a very interesting & enjoyable read!"
5,Hummingbird's Daughter,"The Humingbird's Daughter is a wonderful book that captures the feel and the smells of Mexico. The style of writing both lyrical and gritty. Don't skip over Teresita's lineage; it sets the tone of the novel by it imitating the opening passages of the gospel of Matthew through a series of respectful begats, and ending with a crude and very funny phrase. This is a magical book of life and death."
5,"Mostly true, Completly wonderful","This book is the true story (fictionalized biography) of a saint who lived in Mexico in the tail end of the 1800's, a time of Indian wars, ruthless dictators and dreadfully poor peasants. Born among the poorest of the poor, Teresita has a gift that is recognized by Huila, a medicine woman of Indian heritage. Teresita's story as she rises from dirt poverty to recognition by the Vatican as a witch, initially, and later as a national treasure is so beautifully written by Sr. Urrea.The author chooses his words with the utmost care and produces a book rich with the art of language which will surround the reader like a silken blanket. The smell of roses will linger in your nostrils long after you have finished this wonderful book."
3,"A nice read, but lacks structure","Urrea's novel presents an interesting story of Teresita, the ""Humming Bird's Daughter."" Inter-twining charcters and generations, tidbits of Spanish phrases and words spice up the sometimes dry passages. Regardless, the writing is very descriptive, and I could actually picture myself in late 1800s rural Mexico. While I enjoyed turning the pages to find out about Teresita and the curandera, Huila, the sentence structure and grammar at times were hard to follow. OVerall, a nice way to open up your imagination during a weekend."
5,I Tell Everyone To Read This,"I enjoy historical fictions and to find one that takes place during pre-revolution turn-of-the century Mexico was a treat. Urrea gives us sensory Mexico, with culture, and the spirituality of curanderas. Enjoyed the story and the well-crafted writing. Do yourself a favor and read this."
5,Hummingbird X 3,This is the third review that I've been requested to submit. Is this a chance for the vendor to attain higher good reviews?I've had one e-mail request and two from Amazon...what's going on?
5,Historically beautiful and tragic,"Luis Alberto Urrea has captured both historic southern and northern Mexican traditions along with a mystical other world female protagonist in a way that makes you want to keep on reading long after you should have turned out the reading lamp. Sights, smells, dust and heat seem real as do the somewhat graphic portrayals of occasional revenge. Lovely."
5,You Had Me At Hello,"Like this famous line from a recent movie, the book's lyrical opening sentence and all that follows makes this book hard to put down. Any intervals between readings result in moments when you will reflect on the rigor, passion and honesty of the lives of people as described by Mr. Urrea. Indeed, I made excuses to stay at my desk, long after business hours, seeking solitude so that I could spend more time reading the book. I usually pass books along to friends after the last chapter has been read. I plan to pass this one along as well but only after I buy a new copy which I will no doubt re-read many times in years to come. Luis, please have a book signing in Atlanta. I'll be at the beginning of the line."
5,Couldn't stop thinking about it,I loved this book. It was very interesting and the characters were believable. I liked reading about what this group of people went through and how they survived. I would definitely refer this book to others.
5,UNUSUAL HISTORICAL FICTION,"Since we have retired to Mazatlan, Sinaloa, I have found this book to be especially entertaining. We have visited many of the places mentioned---Alamos, Hermosillo, Guaymas, Culiacan, and Navojoa. The book emphasises the intertwining of the native religions and the Jesuit's catholosism. It is most interesting to read about many of the customs of the people which still prevail."
4,beautiful book,"Gorgeous and poetic for large stretches; he describes all of Mexico in one brilliant passage about people drinking their morning coffee. Gets a little slow in the later chapters, but he's got a lot of story to tell. The lack of real resolution at the end is intentional - this is apparently only the first half of the saga. Stay tuned...."
5,"Ania is Alice, and there is more to it!","He gave Alice a different, Russian, name - ""Ania"".He made the French mouse a forgotten companion of Napoleon's army who was simply left in Russia by mistake. Nabokov's version of Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"" in Russian is fun to read. The great writer and translator, he made it possible for a Russian child to identify with Alice and her situation.The story is full of humor and irony. It's amusing for children and adults."
4,Fourth Edition Selected for Graduate Course,"I reviewed six different texts in preparing for a graduate level course in International Logistics at Baruch College before deciding on Stock and Lambert's Fourth Edition. This text combines currency, and breadth and depth in a way that is most relevant to the manner in which I wish to conduct the class. It provides a useful and usable reference to the students after the course is completed. Furthermore, the related web site has been very helpful in utilizing this text. I will complement the text for certain modules (i.e., E-Commerce, Culture Change, Logistics as a Career). One always needs, no matter who the author, to provide relevant current material from other sources. A big thanks goes to Stock and Lambert for this text."
3,Only good as a reference book,"This is not so much a text book for students, but rather a cook book for consultants. I found it boring to read and very superficial. But, as a reference guide in your professional carrier, it is probably quite useful."
2,Fragile and poorly designed,"A very good concept, but poorly executed. These are flimsily constructed of a very brittle plastic that doesn't hold up well in the trunk of a car. Unless you can pack them away in a padded case and handle them with kid gloves, they are likely to fall apart before you ever need to use them."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"This comes with three 12"" rods. Many other pendants come with 12"", 8"" and 6""rods, which allows you to adjust the height. I looked and couldn't even find an option to buy different lengths. I ordered two and one of them came with defective threads and couldn't be hung. I haven't gotten around to returning it, but Amazon is usually very good about that. The light itself--the one that is hanging--looks good."
4,works well and great size,"This is my favorite hair dryer by far. It is light, compact, and dries hair quickly. My only complaint is that it is not as ""quiet"" as I had hoped. But it is definitely quieter than the average dryer."
2,"Can't swallow them, unfortunately","The tablets are pretty large with defined edges and they are hard. They do not appear to be coated to me.Literally could not take them because of the problems swallowing them. Maybe others will not have these problems, but I have to go back to capsules."
2,So sad.,"I usually love these books . . . this one just couldn'y hold my interest. The story went nowhere, the characters were flat, the love story pointless, and the environmentalism/social commentary was tedious. ""The Serpent's Shadow"" and ""The Fire Rose"" were much better books, and I almost wish I hadn't read this one because it makes me leery of reading anything newer by Lackey."
2,Disappointed,"I didn't pick this book up expecting great literature, but I was expecting... better.The Fire Rose, and the Serpent's Shadow were both enjoyable books with lively characters-- just the thing for spending a cold day with a warm blanket.But this book was boring. It had lifeless characters, a passive heroine, a weirdly cardboard romance, and some not-very-scary villains. I wanted to like it, but couldn't."
3,"Not so great, but not utterly awful either","I usually love those fantasy novels that start in a beautiful, pastoral setting in rural Britain. For instance, I love ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" and Harry Potter... so, I was very hopeful for this one.Unfortunately, I found the writing clunky. It just didn't have the charming, lyrical style that I would hope for in this genre.The contrived romance that popped out of nowhere at the very end was disappointing. It seemed to have been added just for the heck of it, I guess because the original fairy tale had one.Still, the book was tolerable and had some good plot elements. I am hoping that I will find another book in this series that will use the elemental master concept and the undines &c. in the context of some better writing."
4,Modified Fairy tale,"If you read and like fairy tales - this one is a pleasant surprise for you. Being still new to Lackey, and having read only Wizard of London before this, I had not expected the magic she wrought with the well beloved fairy tale - my own favourite.The characters are well defined and the main character - Marina - is indeed the prime mover of the tale. There are few predictable points in the tale and there are no surprises and it has a comfortable ending. How the author gets from the beginning to the end is the enjoyable ride. In a lot of ways, the characters behave normally - including in how love can creep up on you when you are not watching - inspite of some questionable decisions they make once or twice.Her language of course is very vivid. I'm simply mesmerised by the way she describes magic. It is beautiful tale well told, if you accept it without asking questions."
4,What happened?,"I have to give this 4 stars (3.5 would have been perfect) just because I enjoyed the first two thirds of the book so much. A lot of time is devoted to setting up the story and fleshing out the characters, AND THEN...? What? The last third or so felt hastily tacked on; the romance very contrived and not believable at all. The characters in the last chapters were very flat. I was left feeling like this is a story that should have gone on for maybe another book. The ending needed time to develop properly. Perhaps sticking to the fairy tale formula was too confining, though it's been done before with much success and I certainly disagree that the whole Sleeping Beauty tale has been overdone. Let's just say that this one must have been rushed to publication before it was ready and it's too bad, because it was a good, strong story. I still enjoyed it and recommend it to fans of this author, though perhaps not to others. Don't start reading Lackey with this book; it's not her best."
4,Sleeping Beauty coming of age novel,"Good parable based on the Sleeping Beauty myth mixed with a kind of eco-terrorism. While the villains are rather cardboard and the love interest is rather shoe horned into the plot at the end of the novel, it's a relatively good read. The heroine is a little too together for her age, but hey, Y/A novels should give their audience something to aim for. A worthwhile read with a small smattering of history will make for a light historical romance for a teenager. For this adult, it was a nice bit of mind-candy snack."
3,Yawn,"This book is a retelling of Sleeping Beauty, with a somewhat interesting Elements-based magic system rather than Fairies. Unfortunately, that bit of interest was squandered in this book. While individual sentences were well-written, there seems to have been a lot of cutting and pasting that often ruined the flow of passages. Marina should have been named ""Mary Sue"", what with all the people being so impressed by her wit and grace. And the ending was abrupt and unsupported: all of the sudden she loves Andrew? That was hard to take, given that I pictured him a lot like Dr. Watson. All in all, not a bad way to spend a few hours, but nothing special."
4,Interesting blend of historical romance and fairy tale,"I have a particular fondness for books in which the author takes a well-worn idea and gives it a new twist. I thought this was a rather nice example.Mercedes Lackey combines an historical romance with the fairy tale of sleeping beauty and comes up with something really different. As far as I could tell, her research of England in the 1890s is very accurate. There were very nice references to William Morris and the Arts and Craft movement, pre-Raphealite art, William Blake, and contemporary political issues such as child labor and votes for women that added to my enjoyment of the book.She does a marvelous job at breathing life into characters. The main character is a spunky 17-year old who seems natural and appealing.On the whole, I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes historical novels who is ready to try something a little different.Is it great literature? No. But it is a competent work and an enjoyable read."
3,Plot Devices,"Overall the novel was an adequate addition to the many Sleeping Beauty retellings available today. The majority of the pages were devoted to her life before the curse took affect, giving her a little more depth, however the end was a hastily crafted and dissapointing plot device. To 'spoil' the already well known tale, Sleeping Beauty falls in love with her Prince in the last twenty pages of the book, and they live happily ever after. I can only wonder if Lackey had a page limit with her publishers."
3,One of the weaker books in the Elemental Masters Series,"This book started out wonderfully; the world, the people, and the story were very well-crafted in the beginning, then at the end, the story seemed to fall apart. Ms. Lackey seemed rushed to get this book finished. At the end, I didn't really care that the story had a happily ever after."
3,"Fun to read, but weak.","I read this book in one sitting, so obviously I enjoyed it, bur it was very weak in comparison with Lackey's previous Elemental Mage book (Serpent's Shadow), as well as with her previous fairy tale books(Firebird, The Black Swan). Since it was an update on a classic tale, I needed more innoation to satisfy me. The characters weren't as developed as I like, and the ending was very disappointing. I think Lackey is falling into a time bind lately. Her endings have been feeling rushed and contrived for the last several books. Still, it was a fun book, had some good magic in it. It just didn't nearly live up to what Lackey is capable of."
2,Character Development Good - Plot dwindles,"I love Mercedes Lackey and can't wait to read everything she writes, but this story lacked substance. I thought the characters were well developed, but the whole premise of the story never added up to me. I felt there were many issues never resolved in the book: why Arachnia was banished from her family - marrying someone they didn't like never made sense and the reason they despised him was never revealed; why her son Reggie put up with her, his role was marginal at best; why she didn't just kill Marina instead of putting her under a spell; why Marina tunred into a materialist after being raised by artists was kind of odd and why, after only a brief relationship did she realize she was in love with the doctor. And it really bothered me that they didn't follow up and destroy the satanic room beneath the pottery. There were too many loose ends to make this book fulfilling for me."
5,Easy and Fun,"I bought this for my daughter a couple years ago and have used it for birthday parties and such. It's an easy, fun, and inexpensive activity for a birthday party and for something to do with your daughter. We buy replacement pony beads - (many different colors and such, i.e., pearlescent) at Target, Jo-Ann's, etc... The replacement beads are very inexpensive."
4,Fun at my daughter's party!,"I purchased this for my daughter's 7th birthday party and beaded all the guests' hair. It was very easy to use. I purchased extra beads at the Dollar Store. My only complaint was in the method used to end the strands. There were 10 special beads used to end a row. This wasn't enough, and I couldn't find replacements. I tried to use little elastic bands but could have used instructions on how to put the bands in effectively. Perhaps someone with more ingenuity could figure out a way. Still, it was a lot of fun. And my daughter uses it with her dolls."
2,Not enough beads to be a good buy,"I have read the two reviews and was ready to add this beader to my shopping list when it dawned on me...I went back and enlarged the pictures of the two girls with the beads in their hair. If you count, you will see that each girl has at least 40 beads per strand. Since the kit only comes with 40 beads plus the 10 clip beads, you can only make two strands of hair with beads. If you think about it....this means you not only have to buy this product at about $20 plus shipping, but you have to find a store that sells beads and buy more. Was originally going to get this for my granddaughter but I think I'll buy her something else that won't cost extra to make the whole thing complete. I gave this product 2 stars because I think it would be fun, just not good enough when you have to buy extra beads to make it a complete set."
5,Awsome,Awsome! I have used this for birthday gifts and kids love it! Have also used this at birthday parties. The kids love them. Have been using mine for several years and I have now picked them up for birthday gifts for other little girls. Fun fun fun!
1,Broken,"When I received my Quick Bead I wrapped it up for my daughter for Christmas. We eagerly opened it, put it together, and then IT NEVER WORKED."
3,bought two types.,"I wasn't sure which unit my girls wanted, so i bought the other unit also. the other one is easier to operate for youngsters."
2,Don't buy this unheard,"I really enjoy Doves, Coldplay, and Blur, and so I bought this at a large music store in my area that has a lot of imports. Well, this album dulled me no end. Sure, all the songs have some merit, but they all just seem like something I've heard before, only not as good. Being an import, I spent around $27 on this, only because Amazon didn't have any sample tunes and neither did the music store - all I had were the reviews you see on this page. You may like this - I didn't. I'm not going to tell you not to waste your money on this; this may be the best thing you have ever heard. It's all about taste, after all. I'm just sorry I belived what I read here."
5,beauty doesn't die young on this record,"I got this album thru hearsay. It was okay when I first heard it but never really paid them much attention but after my friends gave me a copy, then that record's been all over me for the past ten months. All the songs in this album are great! But if you want to be convinced on how great this record is, listen to Beauty Dies Young, Counterfeit, Mercury, & Out of Reach. Great music, great album, buy IT! Hear it first before everyone here in America can.."
5,Bob Baldwin Should Be More Well Known,"About 10 years ago, I took a chance and ordered a Bob Baldwin CD from one of those music clubs. Ever since then I've been a huge fan of his. Everytime I hear his CD's it amazes me why he is not more well known and featured more than he is on so-called smooth jazz radio stations. Perhaps the reason is Bob's music is really not so smooth. If you are looking for elevator music, this is not the place to go. However, if you want a CD that keeps your toe tapping and really sounds great, then look no further.One of Bob's moniker's is to re-make a song on each of his CD's and without fail, he takes it to another level. His re-dux of Everybody Love's The Sunshine (track 8) is outstanding...and it is about my 3rd favorite cut on the CD! Tracks 1,2,7 and 10 are some of the best stuff you'll hear anywhere.If you want a CD that you will not tire of listening to AND where the music gets and keeps you moving, look no further. Buy this CD and you too will become a big fan."
4,"Try it, you'll like it","Bob Baldwin - Standing Tall.Enjoyable contemporary jazz instrumentation. A bit of vocals included creating a light interplay of uptempo Jazz & soulful R&B.; I know comparisons can sometimes be a can of worms, but some of the compositions reminded me of some of Joe Sample's more recent works(ala-Hippie on a corner). For me Baldwin was an unfamiliar artist, but the track snipets sounded good, so I purchased two of his CD's and neither disappoint, especially at Amazon prices. (The other CD - Chill-Bob Baldwin)Standing Tall would an excellent accompaniment to cooking, driving or staring out at a scenic vista. If you are a fan of jazzy up-tempo piano-keyboarding instrumentation then try it, you'll like it."
5,Excellent Jazz CD,"I heard this CD over a friends house and immediately ordered it for myself and my dad the next day. It's a great CD, I'm definitely going to order more of his work."
4,Kat Colorado is a stupendous P.I.!,"Then Sara Bernard came in. She told Kat that her husband, Jed (who happens to be a cop) abused her and has threatened to kill her. At first Kat didn't want to work for her, but she did. If you want to find out more, read Stray Kat Waltz! This is why I rate it 4 stars. Kat Colorado is stupendous and I can't wait to see if Karen Kijewski will write more Kat books"
4,A shock to the system,"I started reading this book and I was suddenly right there with Kat. (It doesn't hurt that my nickname is Kat. It's what attracted me to this series in the first place.) I understand loss and I think this was handled beautifully. I hear that some people wanted this book to be about Hank's death and even though it is a secondary plot, I think this book is exactly about his death. Kat is the sort of person who goes on and keeps moving. I can't see her leting herself sink into despair over something like this, even if it meant driving herself into the ground.The author does an excellent job of writing all of the characters and I cannot wait for the next book."
2,even a gifted writer can make a mistake,"this book starts out slowly and then goes downhill. the characters, victims and villians, are not believable and by the end of this book you are rooting for them all, kat included, to go away. i am curious to see if this is a one-time thing or if this series has reached an end."
2,Mediocre.,I didn't like it from the very beginning. The story just irritated me and couldn't wait for it to be over. I think I'm done with Kijewski's books
2,Not Impressed,"Before Stray Kat Waltz, I had never read another book by Karen Kijewski. I was not impressed. Perhaps this book was not the best representative of KK's skills as a writer.I found her character development lacking. None of her characters was sympathetic - even Kat, the protagonist. I didn't like Kat and couldn't relate to her;I didn't find her the least bit interesting. She was a condescending know-it-all. Too preachy in some parts, as well as far too solemn and drab.Karen tries humor here and there, but she's not funny. She uses more cliches in this book than any other author I've read before. The book is replete with them.I finished this book, because I finish every book I start, but I didn't find it to be a ""joy ride."""
2,"Is it just me, or was this book missing something?","I have to first say that I am a big fan of Kijewski's, but I don't want to even admit that I purchased this one. From the very beginning, I thought maybe I had skipped a book, (what happened to Hank?!?) or maybe I bought the wrong book altogether,I didn't recognize any of the characters. I really was looking forward to this one, but now I wonder if I should bother with any more Kat Colorado mysteries.Has anybody seen our beloved P.I. Kat, with the wise-cracking spunky attitude? We miss her."
3,"Entertaining, but.....","I was disappointed that she killed off Hank, & didn't want to even get into the book.I prefer series with monogomous relationships,& it looked like Kat was headed that way. Hank was a believable character, sorry to see him go."
5,"A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS KAT BOOKS, BUT STILL GREAT!","I love Ms. Kijewski's Kat Colorado books, I bought the whole series on Amazon and read them consecutively, this book was not as upbeat as the previous books, undoubtedly due to the fact that Hank the Hunk had just been killed (what a heartbreaker that was!) I hope that Ms. Kijewski has other books planned in this series, may I suggest that a Dallas/Bobby Ewing-type resurrection of Hank would not come amiss! All in all though, the whole series was a great one, not only the plot lines with their twists and turns, but also the dry and witty sense of humor of Kat herself, made the books so enjoyable."
4,Left me wanting more,"I had never heard of Karen Kijewski, although I am an avid Mystery reader, until I found the entire set at a used book store one day. I loved all 9 but was not happy with this last one for 2 reasons - she killed off Hank and this was apparently her last book. Does anyone know what happened to this author, why she's never written anymore in the series? I'm hungry for more!!! I liked Sue Grafton up to a point, but Kat Colorado has it all over the Grafton character. I've tried everything I can think of to find out more about Kijewski but have come up emtpy. If anyone knows anything, I would love an answer..."
3,"The story was good, but............","for me it can't make up for the loss of Hank. There are a lot of good non-series mysteries to read, but what I like about series mysteries is a chance to follow the characters relationships. I know real life isn't always ""happy ever after"" but since these series arn't real life I would prefer not to read ""unhapply ever after""."
3,Weakest of Kijewski's books,"I've been a big fan of Kijewski and was disappointed by this book. It wasn't bad, but certainly didn't stand up to expectations which were set with her earliest books. When she stuck to the mystery aspect of the plot the book was an enjoyable read, but I found myself dreading the passages where Kat lamented over her loss. - it seemed completely disjointed from the rest of the book"
4,Kat Colorado lures me in again.,"I've enjoyed the evolution to maturity of Kat Colorado in the pages of Ms. Kijewski's novels. In the loss of Hank, the author lets the reader know how vulnerable we are - even super-women, like Kat. I especially liked the chapters devoted to her time at the Sunflower Clinic. Way to go, Kat. I'd love to see a new release that deals with her friends and family!"
3,It was okay,I thought that it was okay ... I enjoyed the previous ones better and am rereading them. I didn't like the way the story kept skipping back and forth to someone else's perspective ... I found it confusing.
2,Not Terribly Impressed,"I ordered this book because I loved the Harold and the Purple Crayon series (also by Crockett Johnson), but the Ellen's Lion stories are not nearly as good. I hate to say it, but I was really disappointed with this buy. Rather than recommend this series, I would recommend racking up on all of the Harold and the Purple Crayon stories, as I've yet to encounter one that wasn't wonderfully inventive and fun!"
1,A bit of sham,I was looking forward to this but it's a slim paper back book with a bland text book cover. It's certainly not worth the price.
3,A brief history of the Yorkshire Regiments,"This book is 238 pages and includes many black and white photographs. A chronology of the Second World War is also included for reference. The regiments included are The King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, The East Riding Yeomanry, The York and Lancaster Regiment, The Duke of Wellingtons Regiment, The East Yorkshire Regiment, The Green Howards and The West Yorkshire Regiment. This is a great book if you are interested in all of the Yorkshire regiments, but of course, there is not a lot of space to provide complete records for each one."
3,"Doesn't come close to fitting a 17"" Laptop","I love this bag. I purchased about a month ago. I tried to put my laptop in it today and it doesn't come close to fitting my 17"" laptop. Now I have to buy another bag."
3,NUMB SKULLS,"Clare Kramer's passionate and controlled performance elevates this SKULLS entry, possibly the most effective of the trilogy. She plays the daughter of a former Skulls member who challenges their ""no female"" rule and manages to get herself inducted into the secret covert society. As in the other two SKULLS, a murder occurs with the requisite coverup and it's up to Kramer to expose the organization. The movie has some tense moments and avoids some tired cliches of the other two. Bryce Johnson is the sleazy Roger, and his involvement in the scam is surprisingly resolved. Vets Barry Bostwick and Len Cariou round out the cast and while everything's fairly predictable, a few twists at the end are refreshing."
2,Don't waste your time...,"If you're a guy, the only real highpoint of this movie is Clare Kramer, although the the character that she plays is rather self-righteous and annoying.The thing that gets me about this movie is the fact that her character is really indignent that such sexist group like the Skulls is allowed to opperate on campus, but when they relent and allow her to joing, she has no problem with becoming a member of an elitist secret society. That's modern feminism for you, I guess.Story wise, this movie isn't all that thrilling, and to say that it isn't predictable would would be rather deceptive. There's just nothing about this movie--aside from Claire Kramer--really worth talking about, and there is no way that I'd ever recommend it."
3,"[Out of Five] Not bad, Clare Kramer is fine, but...","This Series is running out of steam. Seeit on TV if you can, but see the first 2in the Series first (Who's?) Barry Bostwick[he's better in Leslie Nielsen's 'Spy Hard]is also diabolical in here about Fraternityboss who has plan to infiltrate his Co. intoUS Military with help of CLare's father - untilkilled by his son (!) at the end. Good ending!"
2,Not one of Kissin's best performance,"This is what happens when the ""Russian National Treasure"" got famous. It's a lot souless than the performance from his earlier years, which brought a lot of viewers to tears."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought a Panasonic because I like the brand in general and the description seemed to suit all my needs. I wanted something that could run off batteries and was small so I could travel with it easily. When I received the product I was glad to see it was compact and ran off batteries, unfortunately, these two features are useless if the product doesn't actually shave. This Panasonic electric shaver will not remove the stubble from your face. I consider it a complete waste of money and will never buy another Panasonic razor again. I have used it for two weeks now and it literally takes 10 to 15 minutes to shave, after which I find myself switching to a real bladed razor anyway to pick up the stragglers the Panasonic left behind. I gave this razor a fair chance and it disappointed me completely. I would highly recommend going for a more expensive model from another brand, which is what I am now going to do. I used to own a Norelco and am sorry I tried switching."
3,"Maybe not for beginners, but nothing much for the advanced.","Some nice samples of comic art, with basic 'how to draw people' info. Unfortunately the author never really shows a direct connection between the two. Something about exaggerating motion and form would have been helpful.About 1/4 to 1/3 of the book covers developing a complete comic, that is finally inked in B/W. But nothing about using color. Nothing about getting work 'camera ready' and / or how to digitalize it.I think some of Burne Hogarth timeless books would be a much better investment"
2,Same old drawing book.,"Normally I don't but into ""how to draw"" books. Drawing skill comes with practice, not by reading. I heard this was a good one so broke down and bought it (with a few others) they all collect dust on my shelf."
3,this guide was semi-helpful,"this book was written in ""Cosmo-speak"", which really isn't much of a surprise since Brown was the editor of Cosmo. In addition, Brown gets most of the writing tips for this book from other writers' guides. It would probably be best just to buy the other writing guides that she makes reference to. She does share some interesting stories, though, but nothing relatively important to helping someone with their writing skills."
4,A practical and simple book to help a first time writer!,"Although this was the first book I have read on the subject of getting published, it was very easy to follow and gave a lot of encouragement and support for a novice writer. Definitely a good start on the road to writing professionally."
2,"Taste fine, however...","I stopped buying these when I noticed they now contain ""PGPR"". (Google it)I now buy only Pearson's mint patties."
3,They're Monterrey Mints now!,"They were once produced in York, PA, but that was a long time ago. Now they're from Monterrey Mexico. Same great taste? Who knows. I hadn't had any for years until I wolfed my way through one of these boxes. They taste good enough, but I'll never know if they were like the originals from York. Why does something like this need to be imported?"
5,I am doing LifePac - and I really like it!,"This is my first year of LifePac Gold History, and I have found it to be a great book. It has made history much more fun, and it's from a Christian perspective. Great books!"
4,user-friendly modules -- both for children and parents,"bought for nieces who are homeschooling...my sister raved about it as they are easy to use. she even told me that she understood our some academic subjects better now than how it was taught in traditional schools. :P simple and easy to understand. my nieces love them as they are able to explore things on their own, learn to become independent, and more inquisitive. i never thought homeschooling would be fun -- these materials make it more fun!"
5,A winner,My ten month old girls are endlessly facinated by this book and have been for months. They look and look at the wonderful photographs of familiar things that are all the same color and love to hear me tell them what is what.
5,Great learning book,"I purchased this book for my 10 month old son, who now knows colors!! He can now find colors not only in the book, but everywhere. He loves the vibrant colors and babies displayed in the book. I would highly recommed this book!!"
3,Different book from Look Inside,"I'm disappointed, because the book that Amazon now sells is NOT the book that you see when you view the Look Inside. The new book has no pictures of babies, which is why I bought the book in the first place. Other than that, the new book is very cute, the pages are sturdy, and there are tabs on the side to help the baby turn the pages."
3,This charm is not 3D,"From the picture, I expected this charm to be a 3D miniature whale. Be warned that this charm is not 3D. Although it is cute, the back of the charm is open-- it is a flat charm, rather than a hollow 3D charm. I was disappointed by this, since many Rembrandt charms are tiny miniatures of the actual item."
4,"Great deal, and works in my Treo 680.","I bought this to use in a Treo 680 after 2 other purchases failed to work. The price was reasonable & the USB reader is fairly fast. (A lot faster than using the Treo as a card reader) Transferring files to and from my phone is much quicker now, and I could not be happier with the purchase. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that I have had slightly faster SD cards."
1,Broke after 2 months,"I had this a couple of months and sadly, the card reader just stopped working :( I wrote to the seller with no response. Beware"
1,SANDISK WILL NOT WARRANTY PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH AMAZON,"My 4GB SDHC ULTRA II disk failed 3 mo's after I purchased it from Amazon. Contacted Sandisk after reformatting failed. After 3 weeks of waiting, I was told they WILL NOT WARRANTY PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH AMAZON. They didn't give any reason for this action. (There was no damage or misuse on my part) Hopefully Amazon will correct the problem since they state a 5 yr. warranty.I'll never buy another product from Sandisk, they don't have any faith in their products and neither should you. Very Very Disappointed.Update: This was purchased through the Amazon website but Blue Proton was the actual seller. Blue Proton wasn't much help either, they charge $6 S&H; for shipping warranty items. I'm disappointed all around, Sandisk should have warranted they product, Amazon should have helped w/ replacing the failed item and honoring the warranty stated on their website. Lesson learned; BUY LOCAL"
5,Great price and speedy delivery.,I ordered on 1/1/2008 night and it was delivered (I live in MA) on the 4th (standard shipping). The ULTRA II SD card seems to be very fast. The reader is a bit filmsy but it works.
5,works like a charm,"I've been using this memory card and card reader regularly for over five months with no problems. The card reader feels a bit flimsy, but works great."
4,"Good, but not as compatiable",This does work fine with my DSLR Nikon D40. I could not get this new SDHC card to read on my 6 month old card reader nor my Canon Powershot. But if you use the USB SDHC reader it worked fine. The price is very good.
4,Practical Magic Movie,"Price was good, movie plays well. However, the packaging seemd a bit cheap and the DVD had absoluetly no label descibing it's contents."
4,I too love this movie!,"This is the type of movie that just makes you giggle, smile and feel good! Its not deep but its lovely in its simplicity. I am a fan of Sandra Bullock (and several other actors in this movie.) Bullock lights up the screen in this little comedy with such a fun spirit, Nicole Kidman as well. With the music (soundtrack), you find yourself humming along and smiling as the story unfolds. I spent a lovely afternoon enjoying this adorable movie. When it came out on tape, I had to have it, THEN, I had to have the soundtrack! I don't know what it is exactly this movie has but it is MAGIC! Enjoy!"
4,"A movie that can make your day, even if your a witch","Loved the movie, it had a few slow parts, but great music, LOVED the cast...it departed from the book to some degree but the general idea is the same. I love a movie with a happy ending, that you can take children to see."
5,"A spiritual Mix of love, danger, and strength","This movie is above all Heartwarming. It starts out with Marias background, which clears a path for a great storyline in which the Owens women must go through. I enjoyed this movie over-all because it shows that blood is stronger than anything, it is your family. You never back out on you family."
4,IT'S NICE MOVIE!!!,THIS MOVIE WAS NICE AND I ENJOYED IT. THIS MOVIE CONTAINED LOVE AND MAGIC.ALSO THIS MOVIE NEVER GET BORED. THIS MOVIE YOU MUST SEE. I WAS SATISFIED THIS MOVIE AND IT WAS FUN AND ROMANTIC. I LIKE IT.
3,Not much magic here,"Even Sandra Bullock's best performance since ""While You Were Sleeping"" couldn't get this movie up and going. I kept waiting for it to get started and grab my interest, which never quite happened. It's too bad, really, because this film had all the potential ingrediants needed to be a success - great story, stars and director.On another note, for those of you, like myself, who enjoy the addition of a commentary to a DVD's ""special features"" section, this one is a good example of the kind of commentary not to do. After listening to 15 minutes of composer Alan Silvestri talk about his music and Griffin Dunne filling us in on the great relationship he has with producer Denise Di Novi, I turned it off. They just seemed more interested in themselves than the film I was watching. This was a shame because I really wanted to hear what Sandra Bullock (who was practically non-existant in the commentary protion I listened to) had to say about the making of the movie and acting in general."
4,bippity-boppity--eer..wrong movie,"I have watched this movie numerous times, and i always enjoy it. i tried to figure out why- because the story is quite simple ( two orphaned sisters go to live with their aunts, who teach them the power of spells, and love..etc. etc.). But i think what works, for me, is it's all done in a dramatic, yet heartwarming way. It certainly isn't a comedy, but it's not a suspense or a drama either-it's a combination that makes for an extremley entertaining 2 hours. Sandra Bullock is good in these types of roles ( tortured, melodramatic, romantic fool), her personality shines through; i think that's another reson why i enjoyed it.Defintley worth a look, or even a few more."
3,It has 'magic moments',"The story line made very little sense in any way, shape, or form. I really never cared for any of the characters either, they all seemed disjointed from each other, not really belonging together (except the aunts, they made me really believe they could be sisters). But 'magic moments' are what really made this movie worth watching. One moment is the 'lime in the coconut moment'. The music fit the scene perfectly, and it was a wonderful diversion from the otherwise muddy plot...a happy moment in their dreary, screwed up lives. I live for those carefree moments myself. The flowers growing out of the grave overnight was also one of those creepy moments that this movie begged for but rarely delivered (strange-considering the movie is about witches). And lastly, the fact that the town pulled together to help out the two women they had shunned for their whole lives was an ending worth the wait...good stuff."
3,Not the usual role for Sandra Bullock,"I found the movie interesting, wasn't expecting the emphasis on magic. Not one of her best, but still enjoyable. I don't think my husband would like it."
4,pcatical magic,"liked the move,i would recomend it . had a good story and keep me interseted. i liked the way the movie ended."
3,"Fun, light-hearted, non-brainer","When you're looking to just be entertained . . . I've always thought Nicole Kidman was rather odd and distant as a person even in the parts she plays. In this movie, she is a real person--well not real because she's a witch in this movie. But its fun."
2,I fell asleep,"I was tired when I was watching it and that may have been the problem. I really like Sandra and Nicole though, but I doubt I'll buy this one."
2,dosn't worth the time nor the money spent on it!!!,"I've seen this movie yesterday , and i'm quite a fan of sandra but this movie is just so boring i fell asleep during it. It lacks the excitment and the atmosphere i would normally expect this kind of movie"
2,Practically No Plot,"This movie was indeed interesting and full of enchantment, but it lost me. It had a plot, but not a good one. I believe this movie could have been better than everyone says it is. I also think that Nicole Kidman could've done a better job acting in this movie. Overall, I think this movie was a little interesting, but not enough to make me go ""oh wow! I really want to buy this movie!"" I think that it really could've been better than it was."
1,Practical Magic DVD purchase,"When I attempted to play the DVD, a message indicated that the movie was not playable in my area. It appears to have been a Netflix movie, sold as a new DVD when I purchased it. I am disappointed since this movie is a favorite of mine."
2,should've been better,"Not a travesty, but a rather pedestrian filming of a terrific Alice Hoffman novel. There are some good elements: the cast is engaging enough, the cinematography is lovely in a Wiccan-Martha Stewarty way, and it's hard to fault any movie that includes Nick Drake's haunting ""Black-eyed Dog"" on its soundtrack. But the film dumbs down both the plot and the atmosphere, spelling out the story so one can practically figure out the ending from the opening credits, and replacing the book's mystery and wonder with sub-Spielberg gee-whiz effects. I admit that I enjoyed the film when I first saw it, and still have affection for it, but much of that I would attribute to knowing, via the book, what was really happening that the filmmakers were at a loss to convey. Too bad, I'd much rather get those feelings from the film itself. Perhaps a remake will eventually happen, with someone like Alfonso Cuarón at the helm."
2,"Not a five-star movie, certainly","I wanted an entertaining movie for my Sunday night and I had totally trusted the review of almost 5 stars here. Well, I watched majority of this movie, expecting the boredom level to decrease, which is sometimes the case with some great movies, they start boring, but, those who are patient enough, get the prize. Well, with this movie: No, it's not the case. I tried my best to watch it to end, but I just couldn't.I should have checked imdb rating: It's 5.7/10 from almost 35K people. 5.7 seems right for it."
4,Sandra Bullock + Nicole Kidman = Great Movie,"Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman, what a perfect pairing for the enchanting Practical Magic. The two play sisters whose family heritage is that of being a good witch. Another part of the heritage? The men who the Owens women fall in love is sure to die after living in the euphoria of the woman for a couple of years. This leads to sure mishaps in both of the women's lives, and we see as both overcome the spell and one falls in love.Practical Magic is full of humour, drama, and estrogen wit. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are the perfect match for the roles of the Owens sisters, and both play their parts superbly. They both had me near tears and in laughs. Stockard Channing and Diane Wiest play the aunts of the sister, and are great.With a great story and a superb cast, Practical Magic doesn't fail in anyway."
4,It was very funny.,It was extremely funny. Stockard Channing did an excellent job. This movie is worth seeing again. My favorite scene is when they are all dancing and making drinks.
4,I was surprised,"Like another viewer, I didn't think I'd enjoy this movie much, but was thoroughly surprised. I tend to like anything Bullock does. She's so wholesome and I know the movie will never turn out trashy. Kidman was too much the dumb sexpot that I really couldn't empathize with her at all, however she was a good foil for Bullock. The scenery was beautiful."
1,A Fizzle,"This is, without a doubt, one of the worst films that I have ever seen. I purchased the video second-hand and was really looking forward to viewing it, especially after a highlight article in ""Victoria"" magazine on the location of the shoot. The house and garden set and the town in which the film is set are enchanting. But very patchy performances from Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman and a ridiculous script and story line render this film about as dazzling as a wet sparkler on a foggy Fourth of July. Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest are wonderful, as usual and exude far more sex appeal than their younger co-stars but they disappear for most of the film (magic or just poor directing?). Aidan Quinn is badly miscast as the love interest-come-detective. If you're looking for magic and romantic comedy, you're better off watching re-runs of ""Bewitched""."
1,A Total Disappointment,I rented this DVD mainly because of the large percentage of 5star reviews presented on this Amazon page. Maybe I should haveconcentrated on the few 1 star reviews instead. The only good thing about the movie was the 5.1 soundtrack. If you want to see a great witch movie then you should watch 'The Witches of Eastwick'. This movie may be 12 years old but it kicks butt. I'm sorry to say that Practical Magic just does not make the grade.
2,Practically dreadful,Two sister witches try adapting to life under family curse which ensures death for any man a given sister truly loves. Kidman's boyfriend (who she obviously must not have truly loved) turns out to be an abusive alcoholic who attacks her and Bullock when she rushes to her aid. Bullock accidently kills him and the two are desparate to dispose of the body. What builds itself nicely with some actual characters and plot goes for CASPER/THE FRIGHTENERS special effects to move it along and then relies on a BARNEY & FRIENDS style ending to tie the whole thing together. Only entertaining in the beginning. Take my advise and skip.
2,I dare you.,"I defy anyone to explain the story of this movie without stammering and possibly giggling. This movie is boring. It has no energy. Even really bad movies have energy, but this one's just a rock. They managed to make a boring story out of supernatural people. Congratulations. Also, they managed to make us feel comfortable with Sandra killing a guy. And then we see her SOOOOO upset about her upbringing that it causes her to... open a store! And what's with that ""he'll have these color eyes,"" thing, and then the guy doesn't have the right color! Nice touch."
1,Couldn't Sit Through It,This movie was minipulated so much from the book that it made it immposible to watch. The story line was a joke and the acting mediocre at best. One word summation: Crap.
1,Another misstep from Sandra Bullock.,"Someone needs to tell Sandra that not all good movies are romantic comedies. This one adds a bit of a twist, but basically it's just a by-the-numbers jilted lovers movie. The witchcraft aspect is enticing, but they do not go nearly into the depth with this one as they did with ""The Craft."" ""Practical Magic"" is a hackneyed concept rehashed once again, simply a star vehicle for Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. We can't really blame them though. Whenever they try to make something else they walk away with ""Speed 2,"" ""The Net"" or ""The Peacemaker."" ""Practical Magic"" is nearly unforgiveable, albeit with an OK ending involving raising the evil dead. It doesn't save this. The only reason this movie was made was thanks to the incomprehensible success of ABC's insipid ""Sabrina the Teen-Age Witch."" For a more interesting witch movie, check out ""The Craft."" As far as relationship movies go, just stop watching movies for cinema's sake. They're getting extremely old."
5,The Best Movie,"Great grafics,was suspencful, had romantic parts in it,and was realy funny!!And over all it was a great movie!!!"
2,not what i wanted,this was a copy of the movie overscored with an editorial extra by the director/actors & actresses.all i wanted was the movie. was disappointed.
4,one of my favorites!,"This is one of my favorite movies. A good combination of drama, comedy and just a little bit of cheesiness makes it very entertaining. It has a great soundtrack as well."
5,Practical Magic,I bought Practical Magic on DVD for my mother for Christmas. It came very quickly and even before Christmas even though I ordered it about a week before the 25th. I'd definately do business again with this merchant.
4,Two witches make magic!,"Nobody was more perfect for this film than Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. Kidman's role probably led to her starring in 2005's BEWITCHED playing Samantha Stevens. If you're a fan of the sitcom and I Dream Of Jeannie,this film is for you. Those who saw this film also saw DAYS OF THUNDER,THE OTHERS and FAR AND AWAY,all starring Kidman. Those who saw this film also saw Bullock's other films such as SPEED 1 and 2,WHEN YOU WERE SLEEPING,28 DAYS,THE DIVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD,FORCES OF NATURE,THE NET and HOPE FLOATS."
3,"I want to actually give it 3 and a half, OK?","Pretty good. You could identify with the characters - it was so sad when Sally's husband dies and I loved the bit with the circle of witches at the end. It also shows family ties v. well. I did think the aunts were a little annoying, but I don't like that sort of character anyway. The reason I didn't give more stars to this movie is that it unsettled me, and I don't like movies that do that. But all the acting is great, Quinn providing refreshing relief from mad aunts, terrified witches and evil Buglarian zombies."
1,WORTHLESS,The movie is awesome. I know this because I used to have the VHS and watched it all the time. When I got this in the mail it would not play. My dvd player could not read the disc. So I thought maybe there was something wrong with my player..but no. I tried 3 other players and the same thing happened. Waste of money.
5,Great view,I choose movies for the architecture. The kitchen is perfect along with the atrium. The outside garden has a perfect view of the lake.
5,Excellent Movie. Will buy it when it comes out on video.,Sure provokes a lot of thought. The movie was very entertaining and have rented it several times. Look forward to buying it when it comes out on video. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman were super. The aunts were fantastic. And everyone should have chocolate in the morning. There are a few men I would like to cast a spell on too. Oh what fun. Remember heather and rosemary in your yard. This movie was an enjoyable movie. We need more movies that are easy and fun to watch.
5,Toast 'n jam in Taos,Definately under rated. Loved Stockard Channings work here. The romance was wonderful.
5,My Favorite,"Practical Magic is such a wonderful movie that you can't even describe it in words. If you like movies about witches in themes like Blair Witch Project this not really the place to look. I sugest this movie to anyone 12 years and up. This movie is more recomended more for women but at the same time this is not a ""touchy-feely"" movie. Enjoy!"
2,A poor romantic so called comedy,This film is among the silliest I've ever seen. The acting ispoor apart from Aiden Quinn and Nicole Kidman. Not a single segmentof this is funny and the directing was bad.The script is terrible but at least the plot is fairly original. Instead of gliding from one scene to another it clumps along.
2,Sorry excuse for witches,"Although I found parts kind ofcharming and overall, for a ""chick flick"", I enjoyed it, I must say that for a movie about witches, the witches were lacking. For it's plot, witches weren't really needed. And even the witches that are present in the movie, they don't really do much. Nicole Kidman does nothing with her power but drug a psycho boyfriend so he can go to sleep and leave her alone. And Sandra Bullock seems to just have a spoon magically stir her tea/coffee and she can also can blow on a candle and light them that way. Take these useless scenes out and you're left with ordinary women. For a movie about witches, I was expecting a more magical movie experience.--wcg"
2,Boring movie,"I bet if anyone waited a week, they wouldn't even remember what this story was about. I'd enjoy watching the tv sitcoms like Sabrina or Bewitched over this poor excuse for a movie any day."
5,EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!,"I absolutely love Sandra Bullock movies. I have seen the movie on TV and that I really wanted my own movie because I can watch this movie over and over and never get tired of watching the movie. I got the movie on Black Friday from Amazon because they had the movie for a cheaper price. Thanks, Amazon. I will be buying movies from Amazon every year on Black Friday. It's better then being pushed in a big crowd. Love this."
3,Practical Magic VHS,Receivied product in reasonable amount of time. Look worn out. Have not had a chance to view this VHS tape yet.
4,Great Movie. It took 3 1/2 weeks to get here but it did get here so thats what counts.,Love this movie. It's one of my favorites. It was accurately described and when I sent an email asking where it was they emailed me back quickly. However it took 3 1/2 weeks to get here which is a really long time. But..... it did finally get here.
4,Fun. Interesting. Good ending. Could have used some improvement.,"This film is entertaining...excitement, adventure, intrigue. Some parts could have been improved, but overall a good movie. Worth watching. The ending is satisfying."
5,Love this movie!!!,I have been looking for this movie for a long time. I absolutely love it. I can't believe I got it at such a great price!
1,"Did Not work, DVD said ""Wrong Media"" would not play at all","Did Not work, DVD said ""Wrong Media"" would not play at all. Was looking foward to seeing the movie but I got a lemon DVD"
5,A fun movie,"I think this movie is terrific. Enjoy it everytime I watch it. One of Sandra and Nicole's better efforts, The supporting cast of Dianne Weist,Stockard Channing, Aidan Quinn and a young Evan Rachel Wood add charm to this sleeper."
4,Good Movie - Love Sandra Bullock,This is a fun movie with alittle suspence but not too scare that my two teenage daughter can watch without getting scared. Great for the little witch in all of us.
5,witchy!,"Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman play two sisters who are witches and they are trapped in a love curse set by their ancestor who felt hurt and betrayed. They are befitting in their roles: Sandra as the elder sister with a serious disposition and Nicole, as the playful, lovable Gillian. There is no doubt that the two sisters are helped along by their aunts. Nonetheless, this movie has put witchcraft in a bad light. Wicca is seen as something that destroys, which is only partially true. The quest to find the love that does not exist is painfully real as it is identifiable in each and everyone of us. Who can forget that childhood fantasy of looking for the right guy/girl that will be true to us? This is a splendid movie right up to its theme of good versus evil and of course, love."
5,This movie's great!,"I loved this movie so much! I wanna get it so bad! I'm gonna be getting it the very first daay it's gonna be out in the stores, or here. I suggest that everybody get this movie, or at least see it. Sandra's so sweet in this movie, and it's mt favorite movie with Sandra Bullock. I like Sandra Bullock, and Aiden Quinn's real nice in this film, too. I bet you you'll like this movie."
3,A Worthy-Succedder,"The last Sandra Bulloc film ""Hope Floats"" was really stupid and senseless. But her lateless one is a pretty good one too. Some Good Acting especially from Dianne Wiest she was hilerious. But the rest were good. A good movie to take on a date, but it haas some flaws that I won't mention, but it's still a must-see."
4,Practical Magic,A goog movie for the family and kids. A movie that's fun to watch and teaches a lesson or too!
1,Dont Get Me Wrong: I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,"I love this movie, I bought it on VHS and when I found out the DVD had commentary, I bought that as well. However, the commentary by Griffin Dunne, et al, is so rambling and boring I turned it off about 30 minutes into it. He rambles on through most of the movie about how great everyone was to work with (like I care) and comments more about ""Addicted to Love"" than the movie he is supposed to be talking about! The games you play are inconvenient to set up (you have to flip the disk over) and the other extra material consists largely of a wheezy list of other movies the stars were in. Otherwise the DVD is beautiful, and the movie is great, but don't buy it for the extra features."
1,There is only one good part of the movie,"I think there is no magic in this movie. The plot is terrible and there is really no point to anything Sandra and Nicole do. The only good part of the movie was watching Nicole and Sandra when they were looking rather tasty. Especially the part when Sandra is bending over and tending the flower bed, that was nice."
1,What a Waste,"What a waste of excellent actors and any viewer's time! The main problem was not so much the senseless use of special effects as the utter boredom of the narrative. How I would like to see Bell, Book and Candle again."
1,"Zero stars, I gave up on it - half an hour of my life wasted","My wife made me watch this. The story of witches curses had an appeal, and if it was like SALEM'S LOT, penned by Stephen King and not Alice Hoffman(how does junk like this get into print is one question!), it might have been OK. But it was overblown cheap sentimentality so much it depressed me. Call this comedy? I call it a worthless piece of cinematic rubbish that's not worth ten minutes of anyone's time. And a waste of Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. As if losing a husband is called comedy and having to suffer just like Sandra Bullock's character is entertaining. If she had grabbed a gun and killed a few witch-haters this would have been far more entertaining than impractical magic. PUKE!"
3,Too bad the language issue...,"A great movie... hard 2 find it in Mexico... so I ordered it by Amazon, the problem here is that it's a different Region so it doesn't have any Spanish subtitles... I can watch it... some of my friends can't!!!!!"
3,chick flick but alright,this obviosly is a chick flick but i found it all right not my favorite movie but it shows quality and plot (which is so lacking these days)
3,Very Interesting and Colorful,"When I first saw this movie in theaters, I was verydisappointed. I was expecting alot..ALOT more. I really enjoywitchcraft and movies and book that deal with the subject. This movie did not deal with any of the organized religions dealing with witchcraft: Wicca, Paganism, shamanism, etc. It was very entertaining, and showed what witchcraft could and really is. It is the process of mind of matter. using herbs in spells, etc. the end, of course is a little over the edge, but still keeps the movie together..... END"
3,An OK Movie,This movie was alright...I guess. It really left me with nothing much to talk about. That's not the way I like to feel after a movie.
2,what happened??,"I started to watch this and thought wow I am in for a treat, and then it just fell apart. The romance seemed so fast, he was her ideal man in a matter of minutes (he came on the scene too late in the film). The townspeople got over their hate real fast (and during an exorcism??) it was unbelieveable. Something was just missing ... a better screenplay perhaps. The acting was good, though the normally wonderful Aiden Quinn seemed kind of absent from emotion."
1,Not Large Size,"Product quality is good, but it is a Medium size item and definitely not Large as advertised."
4,Great video,Very helpful clear instructions...helped me to braid my own hair without having to pay someone to do it for me will order my videos by braids by breslin!
1,Garbage TV Stand and Garbage Customer Service,DONT BUY THIS TV STANDIn fact close this page and shop somewhere other than Amazon !After receiving this 100 + lbs of broken furniture Amazon now wants me to lug this box (with a broken back mind you)... to the post office to return it !!!I've asked and now argued with amazon to have UPS retrive it since they left it but Amazon seems to only hire idiots who excel at incompetence and nothing else continues to send me USPS return labels .... I now have 5 of them ....Do your self a favor and don't buy this ... or anything else from Amazon.
5,Set In Silver,"This bracelet makes a bold statement, yet is crafted in such a delicate and feminine design. Gorgeous, I absolutely love it! I purchased an extender and am able to wear it as unique anklet, or a pretty bracelet. I am always complemented on it when I wear it. I would purchase again from skyesterling."
1,DVD5 defective out of the box,"The Harman Kardon 800 customer service line has a wait, well, I can't count that high, and I received no email reply back with the info I need to make an informed purchase, but I went and bought the DVD5 anyway, and right out of the box, it is defective. The carousel tray opens and closes all on it's own, over and over again, it just keeps on doing it, and skipping to the next track on the disk, and the only way to stop this is to turn the deck off, not with the remote control, as the deck will turn itself on again and the carousel door will just strat to open and close by itself, again, and again, and again, and again, so you must turn it off with the power switch on the deck. Harman Kardon, you disappointed an almost life long loyal customer on this one, and on you poor, I mean, lack of customer service, on the phone and via email."
1,An expensive paper weight,I've owned this player for about two years and at first I loved it but just recently I started having problems with it. Long story short the power supply died and I'm not going to pay to ship it across the U.S. to C.A. to the only certified repair shop in North America. I had DVD's stuck inside so I just removed the 7 or so screws and removed the cover. I was able to remove my DVD's and I then proceeded to smash the insides with my foot out of pure frustration. As seen in the movie Office Space :) DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!
2,Over rated,"I bought this machine with the highest of hopes. It worked well, not great for two months. Then it stopped working. There is only one place in the US that is qualified by Harmon Kardon to repair it. They are in California and not cheap. After repair costs and shipping I could have bought another DVD player. I bought my Mother a [less expensive] DVD player for X-mas. It had equal quality and more features. Plus if it breaks after two months I'm only out [$$]."
1,Piece of crap,"I won this DVD player off of a sweepstakes and the day it was sent to me, it worked great... for 5 minutes. It began having troubles reading discs and would continously try to read them unsuccessfully. The tray then jammed and would not open, holding hostage 5 of my best DVDs. I brought it in for repair under warranty, and they couldn't even diagnose and fix the problem and said that they found it worked great. It worked when I brought it home, this time for about an hour. I am in the process of sending it back for repair."
1,Will never buy a HK DVD player again,"Worked out of the box. Have had several problems with this unit. Freezes, sometimes won't read disks that other players do. Had about 10 hours of play on the unit and it just died. Powered up with the Standby light, but could never get the unit out of standby. Repair for the unit is in California, I live in North Carolina. Not only that, there are about $100 worth of DVD's I cannot get out of the drawer! Piece of JUNK!"
3,"Just a ""ok"" product","I have always recieved great reviews on HK, But I'm disapointed in this product. Sure Mine works, but its flaky sometimes. No CD shuffle for music cd's, I'm finding a Purple smudge in the screen when playing dvd's ( center, right hand side ). I have not narrowed it down to be the DVD player just yet. It's only visible when light shades of color go over that area. ( Persons Face ). I was hoping to find some answers on the net, Thats why I'm here. I wouldn't purchase this model again."
5,Read this as a child,"This review is really for the whole trilogy (lol I think their is 3) is one I remember with love from childhood. The world is very well done- only everything that makes it so wonderful an different from the norm can not even be touched until you get to the very end of book one- after which the whole book will look quite different I assure you. There were wonderful bits that make you think- that make you ask why you didn't think, and seens that even 20 years latter stand out in my head- as well as a few bits in book one that I suspect made me cry. In some ways these are very traditional fantasy coming of age books and in some ways not at all. They are well though out and chaise."
5,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FANTASY STORIES.,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FANTASY STORIES EVER IMAGINEDSINCE THECREATION OF DUNGEONS & DRAGONS THE BOOK POSSESED AN APPEALING STORYLINE FROM COVER TO COVER. IN COMPARISON TO ""THE HOBBIT"" ""MAGICIAN'S APPRENTICE"" BLOWS THE LITTLE MIDGET OUT OF THE WATER."
1,Better than the Hobbit? What are you smoking?,"This book I can asure you is nowhere near THE HOBBIT's level, in fact, just because of that praise I give this book a 1."
3,Some good humor; some only ok,"IF you are into the spoofs, this CD is for you. The tunes tend to fit closely to the original songs and some songs (such as ""How it Feels to be Old"") hit my funny bone just right. Others seemed didn't quite work, and 2 OJ songs back-to-back didn't quite do it for me."
3,So-so production,"Not the best of Bob Rivers, unfortunately... The O.J. jokes are quite dated by now, yet there are several on the album. My copy was stolen by accident, and while I would love to have it back, it isn't worth paying for it full price a second time."
4,Good Product But............,"FUSE HOLDER BROKEN WHEN DELIVERED! Taped with black electrical tape for now to avoid returning.Will contact recon for replacement.Built very well compared to other lights.Works as it should.No 5 stars because of fuse holder,thats not paying attention to detail IMO.Packaged very well telling me this item was damaged before shipping."
4,light bar,"Shipped in good container, cardboard tube inside of a triangle box. Came undamaged all OK. Very thin wire, good enough for LED power. Did not fit on my 2008 F450, some kind of hinge thing about 3/4's of the way across under tailgate. I mounted it to the rear upper of my horse trailer, looks sharp."
1,Didn't work,When I received the product it was defective and now I can't get my money back for 3 weeks....
1,"49"" or 60"" ???","Title description says this is a 60"" lightbar but the product description says length is 49"" and 60"" is available under a different part number. The Recon website says #26411 is 60"" version. Very confusing and stops me from ordering from this page."
5,Astounding Live Recording!,"I agree with other reviewers that this is one of the truly exceptional live recordings - reminiscent of Horowitz at Carnegie Hall so many years ago (except that Kissin does not miss a note!). His technical skill and command of the piano are amazing - just listed to Liszt's Spanish Rhapsody or the Transdendental Etude. I saw Kissin in Berlin when he made his West European debut in '87 and still vividly remember that performance. This recording, only a few years later, has the same remarkable quality. And to think the guy was so young when he performed this recording!"
5,Good game and product,I bought this Spanish game for my baby girl she's only 3yrs old and learning how to speak Spanish she love this game it teach her a lot and is not hard to learn
3,Excellent C.D. I like all of the songs on it.,John Michael has an excellent voice. He can sing both uptempo as well slow songs. I recommend the album to other people.
5,This cd is AWESOME!,"If you enjoy country music, this is a great cd. There is all of his great songs on one cd! If you don't have it go get it!"
4,"A good, though somewhat short LP...Their Ghost Town is even better than Cheap Trick's!","Very solid nine song LP in a dark periodfor great Alternative-County-Christian-Metal band from NashVegas, Tn. Jasonsolo is a treat as well. Pick up on this,Thunder and Fire, Essential J& S and ALLJason solo LPs!"
5,ONLY ONE DECADE FRIENDS -80'S ROCK.FAVOR DARLINGS,"MY FAVOURITE C.D, CANT BEAT 80""S. THE ORGINATORS OF POPULAR MUSIC,PLEASE SOMEONE INVENT TIME TRAVEL AND TAKE ME BACK WHERE I BELONG."
2,Didn't seem to work well in the cold weather,SquirrelStop seemed to work OK when I tried it indoors. After hanging outside on a cold Pennsylvania day I saw a squirrel hanging on it eating from the feeder. I tested it and found I took a strong pull to get it to rotate and then it would not stop spinning. I'm guessing the colder weather is a difficult environment for the device's electronics. I'm going back to a mechanical squirrel resistant feeder.
5,Squirrel Stopper,"I gave this unit to my son-in-law for Christmas, he said it works great. The squirrels have stopped trying to steal bird seed."
4,I want the opposite,"I've seen this in action and I'm impressed.BUT...I'm looking for a bird-proof squirrel feeder. I like squirrels, this is nothing more than ""animal racism"" to feed birds and not squirrels. Squirrels dont crap all over my car and make nests in my chimney. I'd rather feed them and shoot the birds with my BB gun.If anyone knows of a product like this, please let me know. We have enough birds around and keeping the squirrels fed keeps them out of the garbage and less likely to get disease."
1,Useless,"Squirrels are very intelligent. If you have your feeder suspended on a pole, even if you installed the pole in the middle of nowhere, the squirrels can climb on the pole and put their weight on it. It makes the SquirrelStop spin and sends all the bird seeds to the ground. They'll eat on the ground! Birds don't like squirrels and you won't see a bird when there are 3 of them eating around the pole. In a tree? Same thing...It is completely useless because it scares the squirrels for a day or two and they finally find a way to get the seeds. Very expensive product for a deceiving result. I removed that ""3 D batteries "" spinner and I feed finches and hummingbirds now. Squirrels don't like their food. I really don't recommend that product. If you want to laugh, watch the video on the homepage of the manufacturer because you won't when you'll receive your credit card statement."
3,Hilarious,"First I will say the ad,(or should I say the box) is deceiving. It shows the unit with a feeder,and for the price I was expecting one...The squirrels still get food. As they jump up and get on,there is a delay for the unit to start spinning...But I must say Its a belly laugh watching them try..over and over Lots of fun anyway......Richard"
2,Not So SquirrelStop,"First of all, the picture of this item is a little misleading. I thought I was getting a feeder as well as the dome above it. Secondly, it didn't prove to be squirrel-proof. The squirrels just had to stretch down from above the dome and knock the feeder off the dome. My husband made some needed modifications to this item to outsmart the squirrels."
5,Great Book for a Baby!,"My 12-month-old son loves to be read this book. It's one of those books that's easy to make interesting: ""Cookie glides down the slide"" <WHOOSH!>, ""Ernie swings high,"" <raise book up> ""Bert swings low"" <lower book to floor>. Very simple pictures and words, suitable for a baby or young toddler."
5,SOOOO HAPPY,"I PAID FRIGGIN $12 FOR ONLY LIKE 4 BAGS AT A VACUUM STORE THAT ISN'T EVEN CLOSE TO ME, AND I SAW THESE BAGS, AND THEY ARE THE EXACT SAME BAG EXCEPT I GET 3 TIMES THE NUMBER OF BAGS FOR LESS MONEY. THIS PRICE ROCKS AND I WILL ALWAYS BUY FROM THIS SUPPLIER AS LONG AS I HAVE THE VACUUM."
3,Break easily?,"I've used two of these so far and they both broke and started leaking dust into the air - It could be the vacuum, which is 30 years old, but I never had this problem before I started using these bags."
3,Nelson bio an insight into Forester's Hornblower,"CS Forester's biography of Nelson was originally published in 1929, the same year he published two other books (his very good novel 'Brown on Resolution' and his so-so travelogue on the Loire, 'The Voyage of the Annie Marble.') So it's not surprising that this seems a slapdash affair. Though readable enough, Forester's histories and biographies are never quite strong, and all lack scholarly rigor. For this, he relied solely on Nelson's letters and general secondary sources. It also ends quite abruptly, with Nelson's death at Trafalgar--no conclusion, no retrospective, no summing up. He's shot, he falls, he dies.However, the reader or Forester scholar looking into his famous fictional creation, Horatio Hornblower, will find much of great interest in this work, which predates the first of the HH novels by seven years. From the first name to the tendency toward sea sickness, there's much to see of the imagined naval hero in the real one."
3,Moderate Quality,"This is a large turner. Ideal for use on 9.5"" or larger skillet. For those who are concerned about bacteria growing in between the rubber grip and stainless steel handle may not wish to purchase this turner. It does have a tiny gap between rubber and stainless steel. The handle and grip is comfortable for handling.Ideal turner will be a one piece molded stainless steel with no weld and gap for ease of cleaning."
2,Broke the yolk!,"I bought this thing because I needed to replace my more flexible nylon turners, which were slowly but surely melting away with every use. I thought I would go for a heavy duty, good brand product. It's pretty (for a spatula, anyway), and it is a nice weight, and all... will probably last forever. But I just can't condone a spatula that breaks my egg yolks EVERY time I use it. So frustrating! I guess it just must not be thin enough?"
4,Good,This is very good and large enough.The only suggestion I have is that it should be great if the entire handle is made of rubber or plastic.Right now only the bottom side is rubber.
5,OXO Stainless steel turner,"This OXO Stainless steel turner is just the ticket for hot gas or a coal fired bar-bie . It's got a good grip and plenty of length but not to much so you cannot put it into a kitchen drawer,"
4,Useful book,"My 7-yr-old's lisp was pretty mild, and the pace of this was very easy for him, but he enjoyed having such easy success. And it is helping. It is certainly a lot easier and cheaper than going to a speech therapist regularly!"
3,Less Ideal for an Older Child,"The book is full of strategies and ideas to help overcome difficulties with the 'S' pronunciation. My only criticism is that it seems geared to younger (pre-school) children. My daughter is 9 and many of the activities are not age appropriate for her, (e.g. Pretend your tongue is a tiger lying in it's cage). The strategies seem good, but maybe just ideally suited to a younger demographic. I would highly recommend this book for children aged 2-5."
3,A brief summary of how WWII started.,"A short summary of how World War II actually began. Where WWI was more difficult to determine the guilt, WWII was actually a repeat of WWI due to the injustices of the Peace Treaty and the brutal treatment of a proud people. This book shows the rise of the dictators (Stalin, Mussolini, and Hitler) and how these undemocractic regimes destabilized the rest of Europe. The result was a war more devastating than the previous.This is an OK read. The book is well illustrated with pictures and there is not much reading matter in this book. The book explains the advent of World War II well."
5,Renewed Reading,"When I was younger I enjoyed reading all the time. For a few years as I got older and busier with work and children I let my joy of reading slip away.I transferred to a job where I had a 45 minute drive. I purchased this audio set to help with the boring drive and found the joy of books again. That was 7 years ago and hundreds of books (audio, regular, and Kindle) But I will always remember this book as giving me the joy of reading back."
1,It is for beginers,"This book just for beginers. Also, there is lot of assembly example instead of C language."
4,The Cars + Cheap Trick= Ok Go,"I first discovered this band on an AIM buddy icon. It seemed like a strange name for a band, so I checked it out, listened to some songs on the website and was imediately hooked. Ok Go represents such a refreshing sound that screams Cheap Trick nostalgia and Ric Ocasek produced songs Ala The Cars. There were many moments on this album I literally turned my half-smile to a complete ""I love this"" smile. It was that much of a joy to listen to. There was only one song, ""C C C Cinamon Lips"" that turned me off a bit with it's strange 60's bubblegum music sound, but soon after that it was back to what I was used to... Beatle-ish melodies and carefully crafted lyrics that truely made this album more than worth the money spent on it."
4,guilt-free pop music,Artsy pop that'll stick in your head like sugar. Great CD for bopping around your apartment and singing along like mad.
5,"""Don't Ask Me""","I don't really know why I like this album, but there's just something about it. Maybe it's the vocals, or the relaxing & up beat songs. Well what ever it is, it makes OkGo's debut album a masterpiece. With critical acclaim everywhere, everyone can't wait for their next album.Album Highlights: ""Get Over It, Don't Ask Me, What To Do, & Return."""
4,"Only know one song, but . .","I heard this band on a sampler CD with Q magazine in the UK, and the track was ""What to Do"" - it was a real standout track on what was a superb album, so I'm here to find out more about this band, because I have no knowledge whatsoever about them. Great song, great sound - I will certainly be buying the album."
4,On The Contrary,"To even add more complexity to your choice, I must say that, unlike many other reviewers, my experience with Ok Go went from minus to plus: I heard the album, liked it, but thought it was only cool to listen to for a couple of days. I didn't actually play it again for a whole week, and when I did I was shocked: Ok Go is probably one of the best crafted party albums in a long long time. Most of the songs are upbeat and retro but have a style of ""of their own"". It's hard (it is, actually) to point out the best tracks, but I'll have to say You're So Damn Hot, 1000 miles an hour and Return are as cool/deep/shallow/hooky as you can get. The cd is 40 minutes long, so you can figure each song is very well ""timed"". Enjoy."
3,they have potential - they just didnt hit it with this album,"After listening to their debut song ""get over it"", I wasnt exactly sure what to think. Their smart-alecky verses almost remind me of Beck's album Odelay (which is one of my favorites) but once the song reaches the chorus it seems to taint the entire thing, which [stinks] because the song really could have been good. I think that the verses and the bridge are amazing - the rhythm is intriguing, the words are witty, and Damian's voice is perfect but the chorus - with its poppy fake accordian-like sound just ruins the entire track. So much for an amazing song, hopefully Ok go will grow out of its kiss fm lollipop beat so that the rest of us can enjoy their clever lyrics."
4,fun on a disk,"with songs titles like ""you're so damn hot"" and ""bye bye baby"", ok go may look like just another pop/rock cd with shallow songs about high school and hot girls, but that's not completly true. the ultra-catchy tunes on this album can cheer you up and make you feel like you're at a party, even if you're really just alone in your room. besides the upbeat tracks, there are also some good slow songs like ""1000 miles per hour"" and ""shortly before the end"". ""there's a fire"" and ""the fix is in"" provide a different sound which is also nice. in conclusion, ok go is an instat party which i liked but not everyone will appreciate."
3,this cd sounds pretty good,"i have seen OkGo 4 times in the past 4 months, although never on purpose. (once opening for the vines, twice for phantom planet, and once for fountains of wayne.) but i would have to say the first time i saw them; pretty much from the opening notes of ""you're so damn hot"", i was thinking ""mmm..this is pretty good."" but by the time they played their 4th song ""dont ask me"", i was thinking ""i really like this"". at that point they only had 3 song sampler cds so i had to settle for those and whatever songs i could download between then and now. uhh, if you are not convinced i would say to try downloading DONT ASK ME, WHAT TO DO (actually i still prefer the original non-lp recording until i get used to this one), YOU'RE SO DAMN HOT, THERE'S A FIRE, yeah...that should do it. so its pretty catchy stuff...neatO. pretty nice guys too. damian played mrs pac man with elliott smith(!), and if that doesn't make you run out and buy this album i dont know what will."
3,Gets you in the mood to party,"OK GO.....this cd is just for fun, to get you in a good mood...if your having a bad day just pop in this cd.They have broken no new barriers, there just a new face in the alternative scene, but who say you can't listen to music for the fun of it. They have some catchy, clever, well written lyrics. They may not look like much on paper, but in the song he twists them around never really following a structure and just going with the music. The standouts on this cd are the extremely catchy ""Theres a Fire"", the dark ""Shorty Before the End"" and the so true and awesome song ""Your so Damn Hot""Although its not a groundbreaker it is just a straight up fun cd to listen to everysong is good in its own way...so just ""Get over it"" and go pick up this cd."
3,"Not Great, Not Bad","OK Go has never entered my permanent play list. Its too short, too repetitive, and too similar to other, better bands. Still, its not bad at all. Catchy -yet shallow- lyrics, good speed, and a clear production. Its pretty good driving music if nothing else."
4,I bought this and liked it! Whoa!,"This cd is a lot of fun to listen to. It's good for 2am dorm cleaning sprees, car rides, getting ready for school... anything. It's impossible to keep from smiling while listening to OK Go. Their upbeat, rockin' (but not rock), powerful tunes will be sure to satisfy. Unless, of course, you're deaf."
4,"OK Go, powerful debut album","This is a fine american emo-rock blend album. the first song, get over it, is brilliant. the band make good use of ballsy guitar noises and daring vocals. at times there's a hint of wheezer-esque chord progressions and almost a mellower offspring vibe.in all the album is a little over-produced, which is most evident in the slower songs which are too full which takes from the lyrics, but it's worth getting for the first three tracks alone."
5,OK GO Rocks!,"Ok Go is an awesome band! The new CD is totally cool, all the songs have a unique sound.Get Over It is a great catchy anthem.Don't Ask Me sounds like you could swing dance to it. (in a good way)You're So Damn Hot is a different kind of guitar rock love song, heehe.What To Do is pop-fantastic1000 Miles Per Hour is a new version of Elton John's Your SongShortly Before The End is a beautiful balladReturn is sad and grungy (also in a good way)There's A Fire..the lyrics are just freakin' great!C-C-C-Cinnamon Lips...Can we say My Sharona..possibly Mony Mony? Sorta, It's even better...The Fix Is In...cool guitar beatHello, My Treacherous Friends is...different..but one of my fave songs on the CD!Bye Bye Baby is another catchy tune.So really, there's something for everyone! If you like this, I recommend my fave Pittsburgh band, Buzz Poets. It's kinda the same pop-alt-rock music...not in that order...^_-"
2,Overrated,"This album is far overrated by those reviewing it. It's not all that great. I enjoyed the album but after a few listens it all sounded generic and annoyingly giddy. It seems as though OK Go are trying for a extremely radio pleasing sound, but it seems all too forced to be great. The variety on this album is something to be desired. Hear before you buy."
4,Sugar-coated Super-pop Lasts All Summer Long,"High in sugar, low in vitamins. Except C-C-C-Cinnamon Lips (which is truely annoying) all songs are very good.[DW]"
5,Pure Pop Pleasure,"After years of reluctant rock stars and angry young man posturing, it's refreshing to hear a band that embraces the notion of good old fashioned rock and roll. OK Go has put together a collection of damn catchy songs here. There's not a weak song among the bunch. These guys love playing music and you can feel it. OK Go is one of the best live acts you'll see these days. It's hard to categorize their sound, but it's a cross between the Cure (their jazzier, peppier stuff) and Cheap Trick. This is kind of a cliche, but it's just really smart pop music. I would single out certain songs, but I like them all! No sad ... music here. Be prepared to stomp your feet, sing along, and shake your ...! Bravo, OK Go!"
4,OK Go amazes the crowds.,"OK Go displays a great style, whether it be the actual music or even their clothing. Their music has a great sound to it, very new-age rock with the slightest bit of old time rock and roll (or at least that's what I hear in it).-demonata of OK Go's Juggling Club."
5,Excellence in the making,"If you're looking for a group that will provide you with a good beat to dance to and hand clapping songs, Ok go just may be the band for you. The first self titled album by Ok go provides us with catchy yet intelligent songs such as ""There's a Fire"" and ""What to Do"", combining unique guitar solos with the always popular keyboard. I have gone through two of these albums already because of how often I play them; this band is that good. Ok go is definitely a band to check out and this album is well worth the money."
5,Reminds me of...,"Spacehog's ""Resident Alien."" Indie rock sound, guitar driven, with great instrumentalism and lyrics. The passion comes pouring out of your speakers. If you like Spacehog, then you'll like these guys."
3,pretty boys pretty songs,"Whatever that new New York sound is i like it. These guys have the best looking and sounding showmanship presence i've seen since the 80's. screw the strokes (even though i like them), these guys revive a much older sound. I see them as a crash of New York dolls and The Cars. With that said it's all just potential right now. Get Over It far surpasses the other music on the album, but hey i'll take what i can get in this void of music we live in today. One great song per cd is better than last years line up, when we were forced to listen to show tunes and movie soundtracks to get by."
3,Not as good as OK No,This album was a little disappointing to me after already having their debut album OK No.
2,1 Hit Wonder!,"The hit single ''Get Over It'', is one of my favorite songs. Musically and lyrically it's near perfection. However the rest of the album is pretty much generic. I expect that a album has atleast 3 or 4 really good songs in order to be considered a good album. My advice is to get the single if it's available here on Amazon, or to spend $.99 at iTunes(if it's available there as well)."
1,Culmination,"As they claim: Equal parts indie rock, stadium rock, and a mixture of Elliot Smith. What is reality: A [copy] of J. Robins and early Joshua. This is mainstream at its gayest. Over produced, over dramatized."
5,This book is funny and smart,"If you're looking for an easy entry into the world of Meyers-Briggs, try this one. This book is funny and smart. Her characterizations of each type are clear and easy to identify. I usually don't like cartoons and drawings in books, but the cartoons in this book added to my understanding AND made me laugh. Read it."
5,"A simple, fun book","Although this book does not cover Myers-Brigg/Keirsey-based personality typing with the depth of ""Please Understand Me"" or ""Personality Type: An Owner's Manual"" (both very good books), it's an excellent quick and easy resource on the 4 basic types and the 16 specific types. Besides character-specific traits, the author offers tips on getting along with each type, as well as well as tips for each type on getting along with other types. I do think the self assessment in the front could be a bit more comprehensive, but this book was obviously not written to be the definitive information source on Myers-Brigg, so I think that's excusable. When introducing MB/K to others, this is the book I reach for - it's easy to understand and appealing to read."
4,Type Away!,"This book is based on the Myers-Briggs tests taken by many people in all walks of life, recently very big in business circles and universities. Carl Jung was influential in the development of the original idea for personality tests.As far as accuracy goes I would dare to say this book gets pretty darn close to what our core personality really is. If you answer the questions as honestly as possible the book will describe you almost in a nutshell by the time you finish. Very interesting! Once you figure out what anagram you fall under this book will also offer advice for successful solutions to work, relationship and leisure problems based on personality type.I highly reccommend trying this test at least once, it's fun, revealing and informative. The suggestions may also provide a bit of insight into a better fitting career and/or relationship as well....although nothing is set in stone. Just bring a pencil, an open mind and a honest heart and who knows what you will discover."
3,Fun Book for Beginners,"This book is more fluff than 'formative. As a teacher, I use it to help the students in my class that find MBTI interesting to find out more about themselves (the idealists in all of us).Its cute cartoons and easy to read questions / explanations make this the perfect book for the novice. If you are a more advanced ""user"" of personality typing your money would be better spent on other texts.All in all, this book is middle of the road. If you're looking for some nice bedtime reading or just want to see what all the Myers-Briggs stuff is about then this book is for you, otherwise move along!Regards"
5,Are you a ENTP or a INSJ?,"Been wanting to know more about your personality from a psychological point of view? get this book and answer the simple questions about your personality and find out.This book is really easy to follow and informative.Theres 4 different categories of which you are either one or the other. ex- Introvert or Extrovert, Judging or Perceiving. you tally your score at the end of the chapter, and it tells you tips to help you and how to deal with your opposites. then you put all this together, and are classified as your own 4 letter type (like in my title. i'm a INTP.).This books helps you know yourself better, and give you tips on how to deal with others that aren't like you and ways to improve your introverted or sensitive ways."
5,Elegant Autum Decorative Accent Wreath,This wreath is a great accent to any home decor for the holiday season! I received many compliments from my guests on the glow given to the home from the tiny lights. I would highly recommend this product!
3,"This book should be titled ""Trotsky is a big fat liar!""","I must admit to being a bit disappointed by this admittedly clever attempt to get to the core of that great enigma, Stalin.Instead of putting Stalin's paranoia of Trotsky in historical perspective (as a tool and excuse for the great purges), he elevates it to an all encompassing compulsion. The whole ""autobiography"" seems as much a bio of Trotsky as of ol ""Uncle Joe"" himself.Little attention is paid to Stalin's other paranoias, nor his betrayal by Hitler or his betrayal of ""friends"" and colleagues, or even his goofy theories on agriculture and science. Even his family issues are largely left untouched. Although occasional glimpes of his well known sadistic humor are scattered throughout, much of his personality goes unexplored while the rest is hijacked by the authors's obsession with Trotsky.Perhaps Lourie will discover the ""other"" hidden autiobiography of Mr. Stalin. I hope so."
5,One of the Best Books I've Ever Read,"This novel reads like a true autobiography. It is fiction, but fiction based on tireless research and true history. The book is compelling, educational, dark, and gripping. It is, simply, the best book I've ever read."
4,believable biography but unbelievable author,"This novel simulates an autobiography of Stalin, over all centered in his obsessive fight against Trotsky, whose murder he's planning during almost all the chapters because he believed Trotsky was the only one that could snatch him the Soviet power. The book seems to me very credible although I don't know so many details about the real, historic Stalin, but as it were I think is good, although it has a trap, and that is the author can't pretend and I think he doesn't, that a cruel dictator and a criminal as Stalin, although very intelligent, could have the sensibility and writing abilities to make an autobiography as this. Perhaps truly Stalin could attain to understand all these that happens in this novel including external facts and internal thoughts, but to expose all these in an intelligible, attractive book, ever for his private use only, is another very different thing."
4,Evil's Mundane Nature,"I diligently read the NY Times Book Review, and having lived there, I also read the Bestseller List, thinking that in the cultural void of Texas, there will ever be anyone with whom to discuss them.All of the reviews on this book were glowing recommendations, the ""clearest picture of evil ever written . . ."", etc. I am on a limited income, and so often suggest books to the library board. They usually buy what I put forth. While reading this book, I was very glad that I hadn't purchased it. It was boring, dull, just another matter-of-fact day, in the life of a man, living himself by the force of ennui. I was glad it was short. Now I want it. I can't get it out of my mind. I injured myself on the job and am dealing with ""evil"". It's just like the book."
4,A puzzling dvd,WWE released a nice dvd set about the Hall of Fame ceremony of 2004. They'd have the entire event of inductees and as extras feature them in promos and some matches. While I feel its cheap to put a match between two inductees instead of once each. Its puzzling because this was such a great dvd set and could have contuined thru out the years. Now you get the ceremony without extras as a bonus for WrestleMaina dvd set. I dont know why they didnt keep on making a set every year for the ceremonys.
4,great dvd,it was a night that honored some of my faves i even have the sgt's autograph on the dvd i owned.When i think of this dvd i will remember the words that stood for wrestlemania 20 it all begins again thats what i think means for this
3,A disappointing study,"Muslims in the West: From Sojourners to Citizens by Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad is a disappointingly superficial study of a very important subject at this time. The work fails to systematically tackle the hard issues of social integration between Islamic society and western concepts of individual rights and democracy. There are many better works, chief among which is Dr. Sami Aldeeb Abu-Sahlieh's work MUSLIMS IN THE WEST (0-9719496-0-3 published by Shangri-La Publications), which is a monumental exploration of the social, legal, religious and political issues."
4,Loved this movie!,"****I really loved this movie. I read the other reviews (most of which were negative) and strongly disagree with them. I think Meg Ryan was wonderful, likewise Charles Dutton and the other actors. I am not a boxing fan. That doesn't matter. This movie is good entertainment. It is based on a true story of a female boxing manager who lets fame go to her head, makes some bad choices, and eventually...discovers what really matters. Men will love it (for the fight scenes, Meg Ryan, and the competition) and women will love it because it shows what women are capable of---anything---even in a man's world). Rent it or buy it---you won't be sorry. Great date movie.****"
3,Look at Her!,"A predicatble little movie, but Meg Ryan does a great job. It is a role for her that is quite a bit different from her traditional image . . she is getting a little older too, and it is more logical for her to play these roles. Some of the fight scenes are a bit rough, but she is a pleasure to watch."
3,Decent movie,"I didn't have very high expectations going into this movie either, but I was pleasantly surprised. I actually found this movie to be pretty entertaining and the story line was good enought for me. It's not the most amazing movie you'll ever watch, but you don't have to like boxing to enjoy it. I would recommend this movie as a nice one watcher."
1,A complete waste of time,"Awful, awful, awful.Meg Ryan, whom I adore, was abhorrent. She was as out of place as a potted plant on Mercury.The boxing sequences looked like they were choreographed by a kindergartner. If you have any familiarity with boxing whatsoever - for example, if you watched just one Mike Tyson fight - you probably could have done a better job.No wonder this movie tanked at the box office - $5.88 million on a budget of $30 million.What a pity that a story about a successful woman in a man's world couldn't have been put together better."
4,AMERICA'S CRTIC,LOVED THE BOXING HATED MEG RYAN--- OK WHITE GIRL IN THE HOOD LIKE THAT NO WAY MOVIE HAD SOME REALLY DUMB PARTS--- THE STORIES PLOT WAS GOOD JUST BAD WAY IT WAS ALL DONE OMAR EPPS WAS GREAT!!!!
2,Poor Meg,"What happened? She looks like a dessicated scarecrow in this movie. I guess she's supposed to look tarty but it just looked appalling on her. Did this thing go straight to video? I certainly hope so for her sake. If you watch it, enjoy the flowered pants that make her thighs look 4 feet across."
2,Love her wardrobe but not the film.,"Against the Ropes directed by actor Charles S. Dutton looks like a fun and edgy film but unfortantely falls flat 20 minutes into the movie. I adore Meg Ryan, she is funny, sarcastic, and fearless as real-life boxing promoter Jackie Kallan but this boring film couldn't save Ryan's potential as an actress. Looks like everyone agrees with me that Against the Ropes is nothing to rave about, this film tries to be like Rocky but Rocky it ain't. Rent Raging Bull instead."
2,Not Acceptable,There is a section in the dvd where for about 4-5 minutes the picture broke up and the audio was not discernable
1,this monitor will break on you,Google this monitor online. This monitor has a known defect. You will get gray/black horizontal lines across the screen after a few months. Don't buy it. Samsung customer service is supposed to be great...but why deal with the hassle. I prefer my products not to break so I don't have to know if the customer service is good or not. Now I have to buy another monitor.-a frustrated buyer :(
2,humming / buzz annoying,The display quality is so so. Also the one I have emits a very annoying hum / buzz. I have the same model at office and that one does not have the noise. I contacted Samsung and they did send me a new one and exchanged it at UPS store. However I am still selling mine. Compared to my MacBook Pro I just couldn't bring myself to use the monitor again.
3,5 months later and dark grey lines appear,"I rotated the monitor, and black lines went away but for how long ? Not acceptable for a brand like Samsung. Monitor does have 3 year warranty, but from what I read on here, it's gonna take me a while to get a replacement and even then i might to need to replace it. Stay away from it, go buy a Dell monitor. My 18 inches flat Dell monitor from October 2002 is still working flawlessly. Even my Digiview from early 90's never had dark grey lines...I'll post an update soon."
2,Vertical Viewing Angle Warning!,"I returned this monitor due to the viewing angle problem -- on a solid color screen, the color you observe at the top of the monitor will NOT be the same as the color at the bottom... unless you are at a significant distance from the monitor. I tend to work about 18"" from my monitor, and the colors are awful. This cannot be tuned or adjusted -- it's just the way TFT monitors are especially at large sizes. Quit being impressed with response time, and take a look at the colors."
4,Great Monitor,"I got my first one with a cluster of 7 dead pixels right in the middle of the screen. Amazon took great care of me, and this one only has one on the very left side. I like its colors and resolution. I recommend it."
3,price not performance,"I bought 9 of these displays for my artwork.The viewing angle (vertically) is inferior to other displays -- there are distinct color change as one changes the vertical viewing angle.The monitor does not reset correctly if an Intel/XP computer powers-up AFTER the monitor (an analog to digital switching problem?)-- ugly yellow striations appear on the display -- re-starting the diplay fixes the problem (I use DPMS to do this).Of the 9 I have had two failures: one quite early (warranty replacement was very good) and now a second one has gone bad.The price is good, though the price fixing scandal (a $200M fine?) worries me. But there is only three real sources of LCDs : Samsung, LG/Philips and Acer.CliveMcCarthy@hotmail.com"
3,Review Rewrite,I had an initial negative review. But I've had the monitor for over four years now and it's been a good performer. Of course this particular model is no longer available. I might have gone with an Apple monitor but they were only available in Glossy / Glassy. I want to see the image not my reflection. I would have given this four stars but Samsung never sent me my rebate.
2,Beware of horrible vertical viewing angle,"This monitor is advertised as having 160 degree viewing angle, that refers to horizontal viewing angle only. As long as you are sitting directly in front of the monitor everything is fine, but as soon as you stand up the whole picture goes to hell. If you plan to use this monitor as a reference monitor, where you'd need to stand up and move around and once in a while peak back at it, look elsewhere.This is a cheap panel, equivalent to Dell's entry level 24"" inch monitor comparable in price also."
1,Failed to recognize 1920x1200 resolution,"The picture was very nice, and avoided the over-saturation problems many monitors have. But the monitor refused to go higher than 1680x1050 resolution. The configuration information in the monitor was burned wrong, with data from the 22"" monitor. This is a fairly rare problem but one a number of people have reported on the Internet. Of course, the Internet was far more helpful than Samsung customer service, which insisted the graphics card was at fault, despite the fact every other monitor I have tried since has worked at 1920x1200."
3,Up but not yet running.,"This product required an electrician to install. The programming, according to the manual, seems to be extremely easy. However, we are still trying to program the bells. This is a product that we expect to use for many years and the hardware seems to be up to the task."
1,I can't recommend this one,"Had it for about 5 days before the end. The lamp produces enough heat to make the clear plastic housing become soft and 'melt'. When cooler the plastic would be 'hard again' into a distorted form. Any sort of cloth or cover over the lamp's plastic housing will/would greatly increase the heat (to the 'softening melting point.) If this lamp was laid down on a work bench rag or cloth and left on 'face down'...you would singe the cloth and soften even faster the clear housing.Mine distorted enough to stick to the bulb and bulb was removed. Luckily, I has there to notice the problem. If buying or have one, at least remove the 13 watt bulb and hope a 9 watt fluorescent would be cooler. Monitor the heat feel of the lamp. Clear plastic housing should of been of much higher grade."
5,husband loved it,hot it is wonderful no so good cold it does the job for what we needed it forhis neck and shoulders
5,"Fast, but not 60X",It is slightly faster than the Sandisk 1 GB Ultra II Secure Digital Memory Card based on my tests of downloading 1GB of files to this directly from my PC. I would not rate it at 60X (9MB/s) but rather 40X (6MB/s).
2,Butcher Block - Sort Of,"I am not a foosball table expert, but I ordered this for an office gameroom. To be clear, this is MDF/Cardboard with a Butcher Blook paneling/covering. The players are light, brittle plastic and the playing surface is very thin MDF/Cardboard with support bars holding it up (it was flaking apart as I installed it). The price is in no way in line with the quality and it is not what I thought I was buying. Time will tell how well it holds up, but be sure not to let guests put drinks near it or lean on it if you buy one. This is the first time that Amazon ratings have let me down - pretty disappointed."
1,We just bought this TV from Sears... Bad Idea!!!!!,"We just brought home this TV from Sears, after our 1yr old & 2yr old pulled our 32"" TV off the stand and broke it. We hefted the extremely heavy thing into our house and plugged it in. The first thing we noticed was the loud humming noise that I am guessing the VCR is making (with or without a tape in it). SInce they are all attached you cannot just turn off the VCR, so the loud noise stays on. You have to turn the sound up very high in order to cover up the noise.2nd Problem: We immediately noticed the screen was slightly bouncing. It is especially noticable when words are on the screen.These problems were noticable immediately after we plugged it in, and we are taking it straight back to sears ASAP!Our experience has been horrible with this one, I suggest purchasing a different Unit."
5,This book is awesome!,"This has to be the BEST book I have ever read about shelties. If i'm ever wondering something about the breed, i can usually look in the book and find it. It is a must for anyone that's interested in the breed."
5,perfect for a newbie sheltie owner!,This book was recommended by local breeders and it is so worth it! Answers virtually all my questions. Very helpful.
3,NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE BEGINNER,"I am a beginner, just out to purchase my first Shetland Sheepdog. This book is interesting to look through, but doesn't contain some of the basic information I am looking for. For example, I am trying to determine whether to purchase a male or female - no information. The book has extensive information for the breeder and the person interested in showing. Perhaps that is why these sorts of individuals recommended the book to me."
5,"A ""MUST-READ"" book for all Sheltie Lovers!","This book is certainly a must-read, must-have book for all Shetland Sheepdog (Shelties) Lovers, Owners, and Breeders. This book is extremly well-written and packed with all kinds of information from breed development history, how the standards were made, history of early breeders and exhibitors and loaded with fantastic pictures. This is a good book for beginners and for those of us who have been raising dogs for decades. My only diappointment was when I had read the entire book and came to the end!!"
4,A good book especially for history and breeding information,"Some people have called this the Sheltie Bible. It's certainly detailed and goes into a lot of detail about issues most other books miss. In particular, it goes into some interesting history of US sheepdogs, and it talks a lot about what a good show dog should look like, and how you can pick a good puppy.It's quite dated now but I'm not sure if there is that much progress in the owning of Shetland Sheepdogs, so I don't think this is a problem. The photos are all black and white and the fashion of the owners isn't really 21st century!In summary, it's a good book. I would recommend a serious owner getting this in addition to a more general book about how to look after Shelties (for example, Shetland Sheepdog: A Comprehensive Guide to Owning and Caring for Your Dog)."
5,An excellent addition to your Sheltie library!,"Referred to as 'The Bible' by Sheltie breeders, this book covers everything about the Shetland Sheepdog, including origins of the breed, Sheltie medicare, colour inheritance, breeding, grooming, and anything 'Sheltie' that you can think of! You will read this book over and over - it is by far the best 'Sheltie reference book' ever published! It truely is a worthwile investment"
4,"Good book, but not what I thought it was going to be","I recommend this book to any sheltie owners who are looking to show their sheltie. The book has lots of grooming , show and breeding tips. I was disappointed as I thought it would be a more of a informative/general overview book about the sheltie breed. Like I said if you are going to show your sheltie or breed shelties I can see where this would be fantastic book, but if you are just wanting to know more about shelties I would suggest trying another book."
5,The one PERFECT book for all Sheltie lovers !,"VELVETT SHETLAND SHEEPDOGS, Breeder - before this book was written, I owned many fantastic Shelties. This book would have taught me all I had to learn the HARD way: experience. Perfect for the pet or show Sheltie owner ! No book is better !"
5,Blender Blades,"I needed to replace a broken set of blades for a multi-use blender, did not want to just junk it. These blades were quick to replace and work great. Well worth the cost. Delivery came on schedule too."
1,Blender Blade,"I purchased this replacement blade for my Hamilton Beach blender, thinking the old one must be getting dull since it didn't chop or puree as well as it used to. When this came, I replaced it with the old one only to find out that it doesn't do any better job. Waste of money. Should have just purchased a new blender, since I think this one is far more expensive than it should have been, given it's inadequacy. Guess things just aren't made as well as they used to be. I would have returned it, but since I would have had to pay the postage and I had already thrown the old one away, I'm stuck with it."
1,blade stops spinning,I had a Hamilton Beach Blender for a year and then the blade just froze up. I could not find one anyplace in town and they want as much for one oneline with the cost of shipping I could buy a new blender. I bought the new blender and now after a year the blade froze up. I so would not ever buy a Hamilton Beach ever ever again. What a waist.
1,Didn't last long at all....,"Fit great and worked for a month, now it leaks. My original must have lasted a good 10 years and this new one only lasted a month."
5,perfect replacement part,perfect fit and works great / much cheaper than the other replacement options. This one blends just fine / i don't know why you would pay more for one.
1,No better than my old blade,"I had been running my blender for a few years and the blade was obviously getting dull. So I got this blade on the hopes it would give my blender new life. The blade did not even work as well as my old, dull one. At least I only wasted a few dollar trying it out."
3,Verify your part number before ordering!,"Recently purchased HB Blender Model #56221. The cutter assembly flange was fractured in multiple locations but the permanently-attached gasket had been holding it all together. It leaked and needed to be replaced. We needed P/N 99004----(rest of no. intentionally left out) found on HB website. Multiple searches on Amazon led us directly to this HA-010. Reading more closely, the P/N it replaces is noted as 9119 670 01. Not what we needed at all. Even the blades are not interchangeable with our model. Always verify your part number and assembly components before ordering! ~ComicKoS"
4,Works with Hamilton Beach Wave Action Blender,"This blender cutter assembly blender works with my Hamilton Beach Wave-Action Blender. My prior one cracked, and leaked fluid. I was a little hesitant to purchasing this piece, but I am glad I did. Once you install it, make sure the bottom of the container is secured- so it does not leak liquids. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is because there are no threads or sunction on the blender cutter assembly. The seal is not very good, so monitor prior to each use. I think it is efficient overall."
3,Didn't work like the original,"It was the right part, but it doesn't perform like the original one. It looks the same and it fit the unit, but for whatever reason it doesn't really work that well."
4,'Breakin' The Law: A Tribute To Judas Priest' (Cherry Red) Various Artists,"Have to admit that this particular Judas Priest tribute CD turned out to be better than I had expected. Really liked Bang Tango's homage with ""You Got Another Thing Coming"", Ratt and Love / Hate with ""Turbo Lover"", Circus Of Power paying their respect with ""Steeler"" and to my surprise - Warrior Soul and their cover of ""Breaking The Law"" which (to me) appeared to be more like maybe a techno / metal mix. Still cool, though needless to say. Also got something good out of the Bulletboys (wasn't even aware they still existed) and their tribute ""Livin' After Midnight"". After I looked on this site, I didn't know there were so many different Judas Priest tribute CD's out. I guess - like wow sort of covers it."
4,China's Lost Girls Review,"This video is wonderful. I feel this offers good insite into the world in China for these children. I only wish it was longer. Be prepared for happy moments, sad moments, etc. Have a box of tissues handy."
1,Lisa Ling is a TERRIBLE host...,"Just witnessed some of the worst hosting ever---Lisa Ling assumes a condescending and judgmental attitude throughout the video China's reasons for the one-child policy. Most tactless is her asking several boys if they were ""spoiled.""--Lisa, ignorant of the major Chinese dialects, persists in speaking Cantonese to a bunch of kids who speak Mandarin. Out of thousands of truly bilingual English-Chinese speakers, how did Nat'l Geo. end up with her?! Her Chinese ancestry is useless in China.--Lisa asks some very dumb questions, throughout the video. E.G., To a woman abducted to be someone's wife: ""Were you scared when you got kidnapped?"" It's as if she was trying to elicit some sensationalism, while sacrifing hard reporting on real issues."
4,A Good Look at the Conclusion of the Adoption Process,"This DVD is polished and interesting to watch. It is a great tool for showing people why one might want to adopt from China and what the process looks like when it's all done. (It doesn't represent well the 12 months or more of preparation, paperwork and expense that led up to receiving a little girl.)I could argue pro's and con's with the other reviewers about some of the faults they found in the program--and it certainly isn't a perfect product--but I think the producers did a very good job within the constraints of the medium and time alloted. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in the subject of adoption from China."
4,Great background for families and friends,"We shared this with our family in the early stages of our adoption process, and it was an amazing tool for helping them understand more about China, adoption, and our process. Everyone who saw it became huge supporters of our journey. I highly recommend the video for that purpose.Minor criticism, but my husband and I found one of the parents in the video to be extremely obnoxious and irritating, but that's just our opinion and others may feel differently."
5,Loved the video,This was one of the first videos we watched prior to adopting our daughter from China. It is informative and gives an accurate representation of our experience. It is a good starting point for your education on Chinese adoption.
3,Do NOT buy this,"Everyone who is considering buying this DVD should take a look at ""The Best of Lisa Ling DVD"". Not only is the price cheaper for that DVD ($7 dollars if you buy it ""New"" from an outside vendor right below the Amazon price, as I did), but it includes 4 other GREAT documentaries INCLUDING this one, ""China's Lost Girls"". More bang for your buck!"
1,Dreadful and Sad,"This recording is dreadful and it is sad to see the venerable Vienna Boys Choir sink to such depths. I attended a recent (November, 2011) concert by the VBC at which I was subjected to this pop drivel. It was simply unbearable. I was tempted to walk out of the concert at intermission.I suppose that this move into pop is simply a bad marketing decision. Hopefully, the VBC will return to performing serious music sooner rather than later.Former VBC choir directors must be turning in their graves."
1,Vienna Idol,"Two Questions: Was this the audition tape for ""Vienna Idol?"" and What would Simon Cowell's say?"
1,Unbelievable,"This album is--from the bizarre ""see my misdirected somber appearance at the wise age of 8-15"" cover photo to the actual content of the disc--an embarassment of immense proportions to the recording, music, and academic industries, as well as to the collective cultural health of the globe. The Back Street Boys are bad enough on their own--to hear them ""interpreted"" by one of the most prestigious a capella ensembles in history is to be stripped of one's dignity. And I'm just talking about the listener. The members of the administrative team (there's no point in blaming the singers who probably understood the shame in providing their exquisite voices to this disaster but were powerless to plead otherwise) that greenlighted this project should be hanging their heads low enough that even the most inflexible of humans is not deprived the opportunity of delivering a swift kick to the skull of at least one of these idiots."
1,They don't sound like angels anymore,"Listening to the Vienna Boys' Choir has always moved me, but when I heard this CD I was thoroughly appalled! I couldn't believe it! What happened to the Choir?! The 'Vienna Boys' are supposed to sing like angels. They were never meant to sing this way. It's not just how well they sing that gives them their fame - it's also what they sing. They completely degraded the boys in the making of this CD. It's really very sad!"
2,Beautiful then but not now!,"Beauty seems to change. I have no doubt that the models were considered beautiful at the time the pictures were taken.However, this is not the case when the pictures are viewed today.You should not buy this book if you want to look at slim and beautiful males naked."
1,"BUY ORIGINAL CANON, DON'T BUY OPTEKA","For a flash manufactured in Japan, I would have expected perfection from the Japanese. I got the flash, took a few pictures and was quite happy, but after the 10th photograph the flash stopped working. What a complete waste of money!!! I cannot even use it as a coffee coaster. Next time, buy CANON. Costs more for sure, but it is not a waste of money! As for buying anything else for Opteka, NOT A HOPE IN HELL!"
5,Great,"Simple and inexpensive, but does amazing things (rapid fire flashes for continuous exposures). Gives perfect exposures in auto mode. A sufficiently long cable allows it's use off the camera for side lighting of macro subjects."
5,Very good ring flash for less,"This flash works great. I have been using it for months now and I bought another one for a friend. I'm using this flash with Canon Rebel XT and the results I'm getting are excellent. The price is a third of a Sigma flash and a forth or fifth of a Canon. My wife owns the Canon ring flash and for the application I use the flash for, I don't see a difference between the two. As far as the problems that the other reviewers had, I hope the majority of the buyers are doing better."
4,great vegas supplement,This CD was a great complement to our Vegas themed New Year's Party. All the oldies (except Frank) are on it and it gives a great atmosphere to an old style Vegas theme. Definately a recommended collection for this style party.
4,Wacky Italian neo-psychedelic pop,"At times bizarre and experimental, at other times psychedelicly poppy, and at other times downright pretty. The singer has a very distinctive voice, sounding a little like Syd Barrett after having sucked helium. In fact, the whole thing has a very Syd Barrett/early Pink Floyd vibe. One of the more interesting things I've heard in awhile, if a bit derivative."
4,Madness from Italy!,"This is my first review for Amazon and I just would like to start with something really special. I saw this band playing in Chicago during their recent US tour and it was such a revelation. Great playing and these giddy, mysterious pop songs mixed with otherwordly psychedelic jams. I bought the album and it was even better: sure, it's not for everyone, but how you can resist to the blasting pop of ""I do dream you"" and ""Universal Daughter""? And their more acoustic-tinged songs are just as good, ""Circles of sorrow"" being a total classic. In a word, awesome stuff. If you like pop music with a strange twist, this is a must."
4,Worth the Time,"Okay, I have to admit that I went to high school with David Long, so I may be a bit biased. However, as a dedicated fiction reader who ventures into history, I must say that I learned a lot about not only the election, but Lincoln himself. David is an unadulterated Lincoln fan, and the book is written from a mid-western point of view, which I found refreshing, since we normally hear the Southern or the Yankee version of the war. The basic premise that Lincoln showed incredible courage in even holding the election in a time of crisis was most interesting, but the sections on the racial diatribes of Lincoln's opponents after the Emancipation Proclamation are fascinating. Well worth the read for even the modest history buff. This book is almost too well documented which is hardly a sin, and he rarely veers into personal opinion and speculation, and certainly never wildly. Definitely worth the time."
4,Scholarly research solidly evident,Those readers who hate unsupported assertions and enjoy copious citations--and I am one--will love this work.
1,WTF?,"Couldn't get it to work. Tried several different configurations. Now my computer has 8 drives that show up along C:, all of which aren't really there. Ugh."
1,CRAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP,MY HARD DISK GOT CRASHEDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!I lot all what I had in my Hard disk for the last 6/7 years......Not recommendable!!!
5,Second one works great.......,"The first one had a bad power supply, but Amazon sent me another one fast and gave me a return lable to send the other one back. It cost me nothing for shipping either way, love Amazon............."
3,they're okay,"any moisture from my feet caused the inside of these shoes to bleed on my stockings. i had numerous ruined stockings from wearing these shoes, but they were comfortable and looked cute while they lasted in my wordrobe."
1,"This is not a ""comprehensive"" book","The description of this book says ""Comprehensive and enlightening"". It is definitely not comprehensive.This book is a collection of 7 studies, on a few very specific topics. For example, ""Reactions of Inner-City Boys and Their Mothers to Research Questions About Sex"" and ""Sexual Behavior in Dutch and Belgian Children As Observed By Their Mothers.""If you are looking for a comprehensive overview of childhood sexuality, this is not it. If you are looking for a book that discusses the process of sexual development throughout the stages of childhood, this is not it."
4,John Robinson is nice on the mic,"Someone wrote that John sounds like mf doom... Not even close in my opinion. I was hearing as far as his voice and delivery, a lot of Keith Murray minus the high and lows in vocal inflection. John is definitely an MC's, MC... I am very impress with his subject matter and knowledge of Self..."
4,killa australian black,"this is a killa band from my land down under, if u like early satyricon and that kind of feel to your black metal buy this,i would love to see these guys but im only 17 so i cant see em till next time they come around anyway killa release"
2,Doesn`t have all secrets,"Very dissapointing book. But this book is a good one than others. What can I say? Well, if you want to know details from this game(ex: secrets) you can send me email and write `silent hill` in SUBJECT."
2,WHat,"Hello,I am commenting on the stradgedy guide of silent hill and I think it was ok but on the part about the piano. It was way off. I would want you to read the section and email me back. my email is kdbussan@yahoo.com. I am expecting your anwser please."
5,Just what it claims,"If you're thinking about traveling down the Wabash River, I can't imagine there is a better guide. The author did a great job of breaking the river down section by section. He gives you details on everything you would ever need to know. Highly recommended"
1,Very misleading title,This is by far the weakest of the 7 Delphi books I own. It is clearly not for experienced programmers. A lot of stuff for beginners (a whole paragraph on what is an integer). Most of the book is just copied out the Delphi help file.Save your money.
3,Better than the alternatives....,"Given the state of OTHER books attempting to explain Delphi that are too heavy to even lift, spend hundreds of pages explaining simple concepts, and then gloss over the hard stuff, this book is my recommendation for the programmer who has done some VB or C/C++ Windows programming and wants to move to Delphi."
2,Not Too Exciting,"The major problem that occasional or new users of Delphi face is the circular explanation style and few examples in the on-line help system. This book's title implies it might offer some relief. Unfortunately while wasting space on explaining basic concepts like conditionals and loops, or repeating information that's in the Help, it is short on the syntax examples that the cross-language traveler is starving for. Let's see, how do we convert a float to a long int? Good luck, as the index is also too slim. I was disappointed."
5,Gift for MIL,I got this as a gift for my Mother-in-Law so she could become more familiar with Greek cooking on my side of the family and since she likes to cook I figured it'd be something fresh for her to try. Delivery of this item was on time:)
4,Not as nice in person~~,"Ok he is cute, however for the cost I feel very over priced for what you get! The TY Guinea pigs quality ovearall is way better and cost quite a bit less..."
1,Broken in 2 months,"This TV was good for the price until it started having major problems seven weeks after I purchased it. The picture started jumping up and down on the screen, blinking as it did this. Then, after several minutes of flashing, the screen would go blank. The customer service experience has been TERRIBLE, which is why I took the time to write this review--to warn people before they buy this TV. The person who was supposed to fix this TV under full warranty tried to charge me for labor, which was supposed to be covered. After that happened, Phillips claimed there was no one else in my area who could fix the TV. So, when the TV wasn't repaired correctly the first time, I had to take it back to the same person who tried to steal money from me. Do not buy this TV! Of the few reviews I read, another person had almost the exact same problem with their TV. The broken television combined with a poor customer service experience is why I have rated this TV one star."
1,"This product is so poor, that I am actually leaving a review","I have owned the TV now for a total of 5 months, unfortunately, the last three months the TV has been in repair (which is covered by the warranty). The customer service is poor, which makes the problem only worse. My TV was working fine, until one day, the screen went blank. Once this happened, a series of backordered parts for repair, incompetency, etc. prevailed, and I still do not have a functioning TV. Perhaps, the most frustrating aspect of this entire ordeal is that I bought a Phillips TV b/c I was under the impression it was better quality and thus reliable. I was mistaken. Please know that I am writing this review while I am on hold with customer service, now for the 13th week. Avoid this product at all costs! If you don't believe me, just look up this TV and model series in google, and see all of the frustration forums."
4,Useful guide to a dry subject is worth the high cost,"This is an informative book, and is reasonably interestinggiven the dry subject. I found it more helpful than the Jon Toigobook. It has an emphasis on telecom recovery and redundancies that was missing from Toigo. The book is weaker on IS recovery, and the author is not really well-acquainted with computer security topics, although he discusses them. In spite of this, the book has an excellent little LAN security policy.The references to Qmodem and Procomm are hints that although this is a 1997 book, it is based on earlier material.Wrobel includes a number of helpful checklists and interview guides. His ""Sample Operating and Security Standards"" in Appendix F is a useful section that could serve as a standard for data center physical security. END"
5,A movie about religion as well.,I've read many fine reviews of this movie here at Amazon but none that look at the religious aspect of AI. The young mechanical boy is looking for the blue fairy (Mary mother of Jesus) to make him a real boy (give him a soul). The irony of his situation is he was created to last (live) forever a promise Christianity preaches in the afterlife yet he is unable to become mortal as a real boy. The failure of the blue fairy to make him mortal and the crumbling of her statue towards the end of the movie is a strong cynical view of the promise of religion and its icons. The film is packed with contrast and the reality of what it is to be human and aspirations and hope are a very big part of all our lives. There is no happy ending for a general audience here and hopefully in the not so near future the masses or part of will come to appreciate the achievements of this future masterpiece.
5,Almost a masterpiece,"When I first saw this in the theator I loved it. It was dark, deep, and cold. This somehow wasn't nominated for Best Picture and Cinematograhpy. Everything about this movie is great; the acting, direction, and cinematography. Spielberg really went out of his way in making this movie feel like Kubrick. For that I praise him. About the ending, I didn't like it when I first saw it, but i'm willing to watch the movie again to see if it changes my mind. Oh, and the ""aliens"" were robots."
3,Intelligent and different,"Don't have any pre-conceived ideas before watching this movie. It's not an action film. A reviewer said the movie is sad and cold and he/She(re) hopes to never, never get into such a world. That's part of the movies' point: In the future, Technology mixed with human emotions such as love, hate and greed will make it a bad place to live. Kind of like the Present. But it reminds us that there is no substitute for real life(humans and pets). We should never even TRY to give machines emotions:It would be very dangerous. But we are already using technology dangerously: Nukes, small pox production(even in the US),Cloning, genetic enginering of food, pestisides and other unnatural substances causing cancer,diabetes,Etc."
4,A Film for Some of Us,"I don't know for whom the film was intended nor which audience it is actually gratifying. Certainly it is not for everyone. Technically, it is a fine demonstration of what can be done today to make a large screen shimmer with all the action of a three ring circus. The acting is suitable to the theme and the characters involved in the story, ""live"" and ""robotic"". Given the film literacy of the creators, many sources are acknowledged within the film and many more are knowingly alluded to; this is not plagiarism, it is fair use in maintaining traditions as well as seeking to give them a fresh look and thus perpetuate them. Perhaps, it should be made a family viewing project so that various differing perspectives can be brought to bear to elicit meaning from the film. Just don't make it the only film available for the evening so that it is a case of watching it or nothing."
4,Near faultless,"Thoughtful sci-fi story about a robot boy (played by Haley Joel Osment) who wants to become a real boy like in the story Pinocchio so that the woman who purchased him (whom he considers his mother) will love him like she loves her real son. An intelligent sci-fi tear jerker from Steven Spielberg who as usual knows exactly what he is doing. A near faultless movie - ruined only by subplots involving Jude Law that don't go anywhere and a final scene that I felt could have been a bit better - that is emotionally satisfying and far superior to I, Robot (a film with a similar theme of whether robots should be treated like human beings). Spielberg went on to make the also excellent Minority Report the following year, so he was clearly on a roll. Very nearly 5 stars out of 5."
3,An enjoyable mess,"Spielberg's movie is eventually rather slow and convoluted after a promising start. It becomes a tad pretentious, sends mixed messages and fails to hang together as a coherent vision. Throw in the typical Spielbergian tendency to sentimentalism, and you end up with a fairly uneven film.It will disappoint those who expected a pacey action-thriller, but as a futuristic fantasy/fairy-tale variation of Pinocchio, it certainly maintains a genuine charm and sense of enchantment. And despite its hopelessly tangled thematic web, it is full of points of interest that will no doubt draw me back to it again."
5,AI - a masterpeice,"From what I've seen, people have a love-hate relationship with this movie. Some people hate it and say it was the biggest waste of time they ever sat through. Others say it was almost a spiritual experience. I am among those who absolutely loved the movie. I almost say it was the best movie I've ever seen. The pure emotional and spiritual power behind the movie, culminating in the unbeleiveable ending left me in tears, and I'm a dude. I don't cry at movies. But I didn't cry because it was sad - I cried because the movie moves you in a way you don't yet understand. I recomend this movie to anyone and everyone."
5,A perfect blend of Kubrick & Speilberg!,"I'm not a fan of sci-fi, but when a masterpiece comes along, in any genre, I'll check it out. I'm glad I decided to gamble and see A.I. when it was in the theatres. This film, which shares the talents of both Stanley Kubrick and Steven Speilberg, is bold and intense. The effects are breathtaking, but its such a small aspect to this powerful movie. It tugs at the heartstrings, energizes with unique action sequences, and offers a different philosophy about what the future might hold. On so many different levels, A.I. is a masterpiece that was made years before its time - and in my opinion, will remain as one of the most under-appreciated films in motion picture history."
2,"ARtificial Intelligence,True Weirdness","This is a dark,sad story set in the future and is about a little boy robot who wants to be a real boy(like Pinnochio).It is starnge and gets stranger and stranger toward the end,science fiction turning into confusing fantasy.The scriptwriters were getting drunker and drunker the longer they wrote..I'm sure that is the explanation.I have to note the incredibly cuuuuuuuuute walking,talking,thinking teddybear that had me gooing and gaaing all the way through!"
1,2 1/2 hours I'll never get back,"I've seen a lot of films, and based on the trailers was really looking forward to this one. Wow, this movie SUCKED. I've never seen a movie that was so smarmy. I was preying for this to end (don't ask me why my wife and I didn't just get up and leave.) Just when I felt ""YEAH, IT's OVER!"", there was plot twist and it ground on for another half-hour. Save your money, and your sanity, Pass on this one."
2,nothing less than bloated hype with a big name behind it,"I will start by saying that I gave this 2 stars for the production value. I have a tendency to agree with the reviewer that said he could feel nothing for an android. Because outside the realm of compassion is reality. And realistically speaking, who cares about someone who never was or will be human. It's just a machine that is confused. I found almost all of his ""Mommy Mommy"" banter to be really annoying. She never was his mom to begin with. Just another store bought product. If he was meant to be human he would been born that way. Not created in a labratory. I think for the most part that sums up the whole approach to this godforsaken [film] Steven Spielberg calls a movie. Heavy handed & boring. I could go on forever about the horrible psychology behind this [poor movie]. But why bother?"
1,The worst movie ever made!,This movie A.I. was a total waste of time and a total waste of money both for the people that saw this movie and for the people that made it. Maybe I can save some of you your money. This movie A.I. is way too long at 2 1/2 hours and never gets a plot going. The story keeps changing drastically and you get lost and confused very easily that you might have to watch it hundreds of times to understand. Steven Spielberg should move on from science fiction because obviously this is not a genre that he is familar with! A huge dissapointment. 2 1/2 hours of worthless tiring garbage that belongs in the trash. So save yourself the money and your time. Get something better than A.I.!!!
1,Too weird,"This movie seems to be a love it or hate it. I hated it. It was too long and the plot was just unbelievable. I'm not sure who the hero was supposed to be, but I think it was the mentally disturbed child robot. Was this creepy? Yes. Was this an entertaining movie? No. Would I ever watch it again? No way."
5,One of Spielberg's Best Movies!,"When I first rented the DVD I didnt know if I was going to like this too much (I hate that Star Trek, [etc.]), so I thought I would give it a chance. The movie was 10x more than I anticipated! The movie is flat out a milestone in Spielberg's list of greats. Haley Joel Osment deserved atleast a Best Actor nomination. The movie is all around good and the dvd has plenty of goodies."
2,wall-to-wall cornball robo-brat,"As a scriptwriter, spielberg sucks like a cornball-shaped black hole. I pity the actors.Visual innovations elevate the rating to two cornball-studded stars.Perversity pervades the insulting ending, along with overall cornball pall."
1,Supertoys Bore All Summer Long,"...at least it felt like it lasted all summer!A.I. is a truly horrible mess of a movie with one of theworst (and longest) endings of all-time. It's worth seeingonce - it's an audacious, honest attempt at bravura movie-making - but not purchasing. Combines the worst aspects of Mssrs. Spielberg and Kubrick. You'd be much better offwith Close Encounters of the Third Kind or 2001: A SpaceOdyssey."
2,I wish I never bougt it,"Strangly when the movie came out on dvd back in 2001 I was about 16 years old and when I saw it I liked it a lot. We had the movie about 2 years after it came out and I sold the movie to FYE when they were still around. Fast forward to 2011 (thats when I bought the movie again, im just now doing a review)the movie wasnt as good to me as it was back when I was a teen. It was boring and I wished I never bought it but I believed I paid 5 bucks for it used so no big deal."
2,It has its moments,"When Spielberg isn't rewriting World War II, he seems to be trying to resurrect the insight, heart, and imagination he brought to his early, wonderful movies like ET. But when it's gone, it's gone. AI is watchable only for the remarkable Haley Joel Osment (who isn't seeing dead people in this movie, but he might as well have been) and the always splendid Jude Law. Hey, even the Teddy (as in mechanical teddy bear with functional intelligence) was good. The first half of the movie isn't terrible; the second half sinks like a stone. No amount of acting talent could rescue this turgid, overlong melodrama. Not even the return of those onion-headed, big-hearted stick people (from Close Encounters. Remember them?) could rescue this story. It's worth seeing for the special effects, and for Haley Joel and Jude Law. It has few other redeeming features. The Pinnochio theme gets worked to death; the adults are all dolts and so are most of the kids. Only the mechanical people have hearts. Duh."
1,POO POO,"If this movie would have ended after just hours, it would have only been awful. However it kept going (and going) and turned into a complete piece of cinematic dung. I forget at exactly what point in the movie I ceased to just be upset and turned suicidal."
1,DVD still can not save this film,"This is a film driven more by characters and character motivation than by plot. However, it really fails to explore or develop these characters in any significant depth. Ultimately, the film's downfall is that it contradicts itself repeatedly, which destroys all continuity rendering it impotent of any legitimacy. Ultimately the denouement is an insult to all of us. John William's innovative and thought provoking score is of little consequence. The DVD extras add nothing."
1,TERRIBLE nonsense,"This film is one of the biggest loads of nonsense that I have seen at the cinema in a long time. The film is: childish, sentimental, boring, ridiculous, simplistic. If you have not seen it, don't waste your time and money on it. It's much worse than you could ever suspect."
1,Just Plain Bad,"You would actually think that a movie by both Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick would be a classic.Well,this movie proves you wrong because both Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick worked on this movie.This movie is pathetically awful. And that little kid did a boring job too... No wonder this movie flopped in it's third week(dropping from #3 all the way down to #9).Save your money and spend it elswhere because if you are expecting this movie to be a classic because two famous directors worked on it,you are going to be proved wrong.Hope this review was of help.Peace Out."
2,Really! Pinocchio?,"I liked the film and I will see it again. But really, with the limitless scope of a concept like Artificial Intelligence, was that the best the writers could come up with? Blue Fairies and Wannabe Boy Robots? Yes, the film has several layers and I get the idea of our creations inheriting the Earth while we fizzle out from uselessness... "" a whimper, not a bang."" We could have had concepts such as AI in the workplace, AI in the church, AI in the spiritual life, the real human arena. What does it mean to be human and who created us? Those would be grand topics to pursue in a film. Not this. Watching this piece is sort of like listening to Mahler on a Hurdy Gurdy; its recognizable maybe, but it just shouldn't be done."
2,Good special effect..bad plot..,"Yes, just like my reviews title. The storyline for this movie ..is almost interesting.. (just almost). The scene was set in the future and the story is about a cute robotic boy who was trying to be a real humam.. He believed if he's a real boy, his mommy (actually was a person he was programmed to love ) would love him in return.. So he's searching for a blue fairy who he believed can make his dream come true.. At the very end, the hero turned out to be a group of high-tech futured creatures... Well, the story can't really make you feel anything and now and then, it made you wonder why it didn't come to an end yet... Anyway, good special effect though..specially the nanny robot and Jude Law's robotic play boy.. So if you really want to see this movie, rent it.. only if you're Spielberg fanatic, then you can buy it.."
1,Awful Movie,What's the difference between A.I. and a bucket of shit? The bucket. The only thing worse than a bad movie is a long bad movie.Don't waste your time or money.Huge disappointment!5 stars?I didn't know so many people smoked crack.
1,Yeah right,"I have no idea what this movie was supposed to be about. Some have called it an art film, I think it looks more like the film makers were smoking acid when they made it."
2,The tale of two stories,"Lets get the technical stuff off the table before reviewing the video. Great look, wonderful sets, Fabulous production values, CGI and special effects. The actors are superb, the characters are complex and multi-dimentional, rich and believable. The story line is engaging, surprising and entertaining. So why do people seem to either hate or love this movie. Because underlying the entire movie is the theme that human beings, in general, are an evil disease infecting the universe and should be eraticiated. Every human being featured is a degrading, psychopathic monster with a civilized veneer. The final scenes are horrific in an emotional sense and deeply disturbing as well as intellectually false. Do not let your children watch this movie. No matter how artfully done, I wouldn't want to watch someone torture a being (organic or artificial) to death. This video is the intellectual equivalent of bear baiting."
1,Merely artificial,"This movie, quite simply, is a poor re-telling of Pinocchio, ruined by Spielburg's inability to leave things alone. There's an obvious break in the story, where it goes from Kubrick to Spielburg, from jagged and interesting, to formulaic and cliche (it occurs once the boy is left in the woods by his mother). Instead of something truly thought provoking, we're left with a visually stunning (except for the ending that was tacked on), yet utterly hollow film, one that anyone that's ever taken an introductory philosophy or film class could make."
1,A.I. = Absent Intelligence,"This was the STUPIDEST movie I have ever seen other than ""Crazy People""! What a disappointment! Jude Law was excellent as usual.But the last 20 minutes were nothing less than PAINFUL. P.U.!!!!"
2,Kubrick fans mourn,"Although an interesting view of the future (which thankfully downplays Spielberg's usual awful family/religion based view of the world) this is such a dull movie. For a start, where's the problem? The kid is horrible. Haley Joel Osment should be packed up in a sealed crate and left to rust! Who would want the pathetic disturbing guffawing little idiot in their house in the first place?And worst of all, there's a revolting Christian feeling to this movie's lazy morality that will have all intelligent beings vomiting popcorn before the first hour has passed. If God existed, even he (in his 'infinite mercy' - don't laugh) would have struck most of the cast down on the spot. A tragic end to a legendary movie career."
3,Would have made a great Trilogy,"Although Spieldberg was trying to honor Kubrick's wishes, I think this movie could have best been served on three different plates. There were just way too many stories thrown at you all at once with characters that seem to serve no purpose what-so-ever. I am a die hard Spieldberg fan and this was definite miss to me. The Special Effects were typical Spieldberg (hince the three stars) but the story had too many holes that could have been filled with sequels."
1,undoubtedly Speilberg's worst movie,"usually i enjoy Speilberg movies, some of them are among my favourite movies but AI will never be one of them. Occassionaly a movie comes along that is just so awful from start to finish (in this case especially finish) that it almost defies being reviewed. there are few or no redeeming features of this movie, of course the effects are excellent, of course the performances are good, of course the pace is digitally perfect but the film has no soul, ultimately its at lifeless as the characters it reflects on. therein lies the critical flaw of the film, it is itself totally artificial and dead. whilst on a purely intellectual level that is intriguing its not enough to sustain a feature length movie. what would have made a unique and probably award-winning short movie fails to succeed as a feature. finally it leaves one feeling sad that so much talent and effort were wasted on one bad idea."
2,"It's not that bad, but...","It's not a bad movie, but i expected better. Osment is an awesome actor in this movie. I don't know if he won anything for it, but he deserves an award. The acting is good in the movie, but the movie isn't that good. You'll understand this movie if you have a basic knowledge of computers...i did, but i found this movie to be a lil boring. Although it makes you cry and feel alot for what the characters are going through in the movie.My advice is to rent it first, then decide if you want to buy it. I bought it before i rented..."
2,Flawed but worth watching,"After finishing AI, I felt both moved by the story and sick of Spielberg shoving emotions down my throat. I found the ending brilliant, despite taking way too long to get there. It would have been moving enough without being drenched with gushing sentimentality. Still, give Stephen credit for doing something different, and give credit to the cast for delivering terrific performances."
2,Kubrickian Vision Fails in Hands of Fantasy Pulpmeister.,"....you could just about tell what Spielsberg took from Kubrick's storyboards and what is pure Steven Spielsberg. My problem with this moovy is that such a drama and collaboration would have gone over bigtime 10 years ago....pre 2K, dig? But certain things in the moovy seem forced. Jude Law doesn't seem to really form a bond with the Boybot (or is this the closest thing to bonding Mechas do?), the teddy bear was it supposed to be more humorous? Osment comes off as being creepy, period. Particularly in that scene where he's trying to mock his 'mom' eating and laughs at strands of noodles in his mouth.C'mon folks. Had Kubrick lived to flesh out his darker, thinking mans' vision, it would have been a masterpiece a la A Clockwork Orange or 2001. This product, however, failed to live up to it's great promise."
4,"Very thought provoking, very very well made","Okay, I've argued with people about this movie, and I do see it's faults. But it is significantly better than any other Sci Fi movies that came out last year (LOTR notwithstanding; that is fantasy). A very thought provoking, very dark, Kubrick-esque movie, and I commend Spielberg for pulling it off. It is certainly a far better swan song for Kubrick than the dreadful ""Eyes Wide Shut"", that can only be enjoyed as a non intentional comedy. Watch A.I. with an open mind, enjoy how amazingly well it was made, and it's message is not a bad one!"
2,Not horrible but definately not great either.,"This movie is a twisted Pinnochio story. I was kind of disturbed by the similarities actually. I was expecting to see something more than that but that's all this really was. Don't get me wrong, the visualizations were amazing and the actors did a good job but about half way through the movie I found myself thinking, ""This is just rediculous. Is this over yet?""One thing I will say, you can tell exactly at what point in the story Kubrick left off and Spielberg took over.Bottom line, in my opinion, if you want to see something for it's great visualizations then this isn't a bad choice. If you want to see a movie with an amazing story line, look elsewhere."
2,Silly drawn out ending.,"I don't like precocious child actors, because they usually can't act. Haley Joel Osment is an exception, he can act better than most professional adult actors. He did a tremendous job in this movie, but the film was dragged down by the dreadful plot.This updated Pinochio story started promisingly. It then reached a point where having built up everyones emotions, the storytellers didn't seem to be able to find a satisfying ending. So it dragged on, and on, and on, and then there wasn't a satisfying ending at all.Surely a better ending would have been to create a whole android family (inc. 'mummy'), using the new technolgy and to adjust the audiences and android's perception of what being real, really means."
1,A.I. = Awfully Idiotic. Lacking. Boring. Pointless. Dumb.,"Absolutely the worst movie in a long time.A.I. is awful.The plot is thin.The special effects are there just because Spielberg was the producer, and they are mostly pointless.Lots of loose ends, very slow moving.A true waste of time.A.I. = Awfully Idiotic.Spend your money on The Matrix, or Dogma."
1,Wouldn't even make a decent Twilight Zone episode...,"One of the worst films of the year without question. This film would've been raked over the coals by critics if it hadn't been for the Kubrick-Spielberg collaboration behind it. A film full of holes and missed opportunities, there is no heart in this film and no redemption for it either."
1,We should have listened,"My wife and I had heard, from friends and family, that this movie wasn't very good but decided to rent it and see for ourselves. As the title of this review states, we should have listened. The only reason for 1 star is the great acting of Haley Osment, although I must admit that I kept waiting for him to say, ""I see dead people"". The movie is extremely slow (In fact, halfway through the movie my wife went to bed while I toughed it out through the end) and was basically Pinochio meets Terminator II........except Pleasure Island wasn't kids being turned into donkeys. My wife and I kept looking at each other wondering when the movie was really going to start.Do not waste your time (2.5 hours) nor your money on this movie, it is definitely not worth it."
3,Rent-a-Kid,"Why would anyone want a child that will never grow up and get out of the house? And why would the mother push the expensive robo kid out of the car and not return him to the store for a refund? Why did this movie cost so much to make and have such so-so ""special effects""? Why give robots ""feelings"" when they are suppose to be tools to make our lives easier, you know, like the computer? At least that's what we've been force feed all these years. ?"
1,Not one of Speilburg's Best,I suffered through this disjointed story the day it came out. Save your time and money.
1,SAD! GET THE TISSUES OUT,"If you want to cry and feel bad this is the movie for you. If you have a child who happens to be a boy, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Very sad."
1,Possibly one of the worst movies ever made.,"This movie is painful to sit through. I wanted the lost hours of my life back after seeing this. Run, do not walk, away from this drivel. The special effects are nice, and Jude Law gives a great performance, but they weren't enough to overcome the mind numbing effects of the story itself."
1,"Stevie, what WERE you thinking?!","Luckily I caught this movie when the HBO station bled over on to my cable station. I'm so glad I did not spend one cent on this travesty. Very depressing, with a plot line almost as slow as a legless turtle, the story plods along to another little Stevie syrupy obession with MOM ending. Time to grow up, Stevie, you're past senior citizen age!Most of the movie seemed to be a bunch of personal dream sequences strung together. Dreams may mean everything to the person who has them,but they don't mean much to the rest of us.Spielberg has become too rich and famous and, like all before him, is drying out creatively. Even composer John Williams, who I have adored for decades, seemed uninspired by this useless movie. I don't expect much more in the ""wow"" department from Spielberg anymore."
3,This Movie Is Good...Until the Last 45 Minutes,"Okay, enough with all the symbolism talk here. This is a good, creative, entertaining movie, but the last 45 minutes suck. Why didn't it just end with the helicopter at the bottom of the ocean. How long will he last down there, alone, afraid? That would've summed it up nicely, but no, Steve has to put the whip cream on top, add some cherries, and then some caramel sauce, and then some nuts, and then more cherries, and so on. Did they have to bring in computer generated aliens at the end? I hate it when they do that! Anyway, if you haven't seen it, I would suggest renting it, but if you do buy it, the last part will annoy you."
2,Disappointed,"I would have given this movie three stars if Spielberg and Kubrick had not been involved in it. However, the fact that they were make this movie a much larger disappointment. Yes, it has some good visual effects, but the plot is weak, unentertaining (i.e. boring) and much longer than necessary. Just when you think the movie is finally over, there comes another subplot, more intolerable than the previous one."
2,There's a good reason it bombed at the box office,"A.I. starts out slow and never picks up speed. This would be ok if there was actually a good story to follow. We get to watch a robot boy get rejected and then wonder from place to place trying to find a way to be a real boy. I found there was only one thing I actually liked in this movie and that was the boy's companion ""Super Toy"" teddy bear. The ""Super Toy"" actually did a better job of ""acting"" and showing emotion than the star of the film. I wouldn't recomend this movie to anyone."
1,"Thanks, Spielburg!","Wow! I had the worst case of insomnia you could imagine. I decided instead of surfing the web for countless hours I would pay a visit to Blockbuster. After about 30 minutes of watching this, I finally nodded off for the first time in a week. Thank you so much! I slept so well that I had my parents buy it for me. After that, whenever I want to sleep, I just pop this DVD in the DVD player, and it's off to dreamland for me! I think this should be a perscription drug. Thank you Steven Spielburg! This movie was the movie of my dreams."
1,Depressing and ridiculous,"If you'd like to loose all faith in the human race...If you want proof that the only real monsters in this world are children...If you want a contrived plot devoid of an inspiration...If you want reassurance that the only happy ending can be death...Well then, by all means, watch this movie.If, however, you'd like to avoid feeling suicidal for a week, stay away from it.Someone made some very clever commercials to promote this movie. Unfortunately, the commercials far outshine the movie itself. I expected a story about androids (""mechas"" as they are called in the film) in which they rally around this new-age child--a robot with emotions! A robot who can evolve and take them all into a brave new world where mechanized life is recognized and free.Umm... No. The message of this film is: PEOPLE ARE HORRIBLE."
5,People who did not like this movie....,"do not have souls!!!! This movie is like nothing I have seen before. It is an absolutely amazing film, and (despite what many people say) the last scene is probably the single most beautiful and heart-wrenching piece of cinema that I have experienced in a very long time. See this movie with somebody that you really care about....like your mom."
5,Spielberg's Best,"For me, this is , without a doubt, Mr. Spielberg'smost accomplished film since Jaws. In terms ofsubstance and emotional intensity, A.I. does indeedsurpass his admittedly entertaining debut. Many ofhis films since Jaws have struck me as veryheavy-handed. Here, his technical proficiency is atlast matched by content.It is a unique, thought-provoking film that is very engaging while at the same time slightly disturbing. He has even managed toimbue the film with an interesting Kubrick flavor, and I think Mr. Kubrick would have been pleased with the finished product. The Williams score adds quite a bit, as usual, and the acting is first rate. Master Osment is perfect,and Jude Law is, I think, actually a machine. Amust-see, unforgettable film. The DVD is superlative.Check it out."
2,So Much Potential...But Doesn't Work,"For any mature adult or person, they can see no doubt that this movie has so many in depth and profound themes that are somewhat haunting and intriguing, and yet beautiful and a bit ambiguous at the same time. I give 5 stars for the originality and message of this film. The only problem is that it eventually goes from being...interesting...to... okay...to... is it over yet?..then to... C'MON, WE GET THE PICTURE, WHEN IS THIS STORY EVER GOING TO END! This movie is just too slow and too long. It eventually becomes quite a bore, and gets kind of silly, weird, and just pointless. This movie had so much potential, the conception of it is brilliant, and yet it comes off as being disappointing because 1) it's not complete, 2) it's not comprehensible all the way, and 3) eventually you lose interest in the movie all together. Too bad."
2,dang stupid,i highly awaited june 29th 2001. the day this came to theaters and i was first in line to see it at my local theater. it sucked. you didnt need that ice angel scene did ya mr. spielberg. i mean for 15 - 20 he sits there staring at an ice angel. this started off great but turned for the worst. do something funner like clip your toenails. just please do not see this movie.
2,"Not a bad movie, but never let kids watch it.","The thought behind A.I. :Artificial Intelligence was interesting, but the plot could have been better. I have basically two complaints about the movie. First, it's very idea was incredibly insulting to children. The movie made it out like children are just their parent's dolls, to be purchased and sent back. Second, the entire movie was ruined by the arena scene. In my opinion, no one should watch this movie, because that scene will stick in your mind and haunt you for days. After reading this, if you still want to see it, hey that's your business. But if you have kids, under no circumstances should you let them watch A.I. :Artificial Intelligence. If they have to watch it, at least do not let them watch the arena scene.I give this movie two stars, because of Steven Spielberg's directing and Haley Joel Osment's acting. (Which were both phenomenal, as always.)"
3,"Sob, sob, boo hoo,","After a scientist creates a robot child, programmed to love, he tests it on a couple who's son was in an accident and now a coma.After a lot of distrust by the mother, she eventually accepts and 'loves' the boy/robot David.But after an accident in a swimming pool, she must go against her 'motherly' instincts and leaves David in the woods with his robotic Supertoy Teddy.The two set out, with a little help from their prostitute robot friend to make David's mother love him.A real cry-fest, especially at the end.S. Spielberg did pretty well, a good thought-provoking movie with a little bit of action thrown in for good measure.But hte end was too sad for me, plus, no one could guess(...)After I watched this it took me ages to sleep cause I kept thinking about this, so, don't watch if you don't want to cry or think."
3,Sci-fi future,"It is a nice movie of the future of human intelligence and humanity bounodaries.Also rated ""All ages"", a work is kid-unsuitable for lovemaking and stone-throwing."
4,Human interaction,I really enjoyed the relationship that was created by the AI ( David) and the mother. It showed me how we as humans can become attached to non human things. It is really unnerving to think this could happen. It showed the extent that a machine will go to when programed to feel love. The Blue Fairy looked alot like Mom. It had a really neat ending. Love can last forever. And he can be a real boy
5,Cinematic Heaven,"Compared to most of the things we view on the wide screen this film appears as a visitation from another dimension. The lighting, viewpoints, cutaways and music were near perfection. Many have discounted the story for a number of reasons which include violence, copying of other artists, dullness, etc. What I have heard in day to day conversations, though, is always the same thing: The ending is the problem.No, it is not a smile-filled conclusion but it is a brilliant and poignant one, almost a wistful goodbye to the follies of mankind. In fact, given the scope of the plot and how it begins to move to an ethereal plane toward the last, it is a logical ending. Spielberg pays homeage to many who have come before him (he has always given credit where credit is due) but he has reached a new apex with this work. This is art in the truest sense of the word - stunning."
4,At last managed to see it...,"Good movie. All what it said about the ending is right, although it is also intersting - how this robot, who developed intelligence and emotions, would live forever with the burden of being sole carrier of the humankind memory? Osment was amazing, I hope he'll continue to amaze us the same way. He seems to be intelligent enough not to succumb to the usual early celebrity vices.To everyone who liked the idea of the movie (as opposed to its realization) I strongly recommend the works of Stanislav Lem. He developed the problem of interaction of humans and theyr future artificially intelligent creations to the very high level, and many of the images in A.I. seem to have jumped from his books, such as Flesh Fair from Return From The Stars and the scene of the row of hanging David copies and piles of spare parts - from Peace On Earth (same as Matrix, btw, which seem to be directly copied from Lem's The Futurological Congress)."
2,"Great idea, not so good execution. Lots of peole have","an opinion so here's one more. It was just a bit disappointing. I was waiting for a ""pay off"" that never came. It just ambled along, very slow in some parts. The movie started with really possible scientific development that will happen, probably in the relatively near future. Then it concludes with something totally different. It was if the producers didn't know how to end it. 20 years ago ET was great. Today AI not so."
4,Ahead of it's time,"A.I. was a wonderfull movie, lots of good fx, with a bold teaching story to it. Great casting! A very moving picture so bring the kleenex to this one, you'll see what I mean. Haley did such a excellant job acting! Speaking of which in some sences you can really see the true emotions overwhelling the actor or actress, watch for real tears starting not fake in some sences which makes this an even better film! Once again Steven Spielberg proves the he is one of hollywoods very best. There were some small holes in this movie but with a huge subject like this it's hard get everything right, still you can understand what the point is. this film will make an impression days after! anyway rent or buy this one, trust me it will be worth it!"
2,Barely Watchable,"This is a very disappointing film. I expected a lot more than I received. A lot of the film a fast forwarded through. The acting on the part of the Mom and Dad and even the real son was somewhat less than good. However, the AI boy and the Mecca (Gigalo Joe) and the Teddy Bear was outstanding.The actual story was real good. a different take on androids and society.This is a film that can be watched, but don't expect it to be something that you will want to repeat..."
1,No Intelligence,"This movie was a no brainer. If you have no brain and plenty of time to waste then this movie is for you. After reading who was in the cast and who was responsible for directing the film I expected to be entertained. Instead the audience was treated to a boring, unbelieveable farce. This film ia must to avoid."
1,Worst Movie,"Dark, Dreary, Depressing are just some of the words used to describe this bomb of a movie. This is truly a movie to forget. I expected a light hearted E.T. type of movie. Instead I got a movie that at times bordered on the psychotic. I could not and would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy and would not recommend it to you."
1,annoying and boring,"Is this Disney, a chickflick or Sci-Fi? The only good parts are the futuristic eye candy which I wanted to relax and enjoy but kept getting annoyed by the obnoxious kid who sees dead people. And I wont even talk about that stomach churning scene where the two brats are shoveling spinach into their mouths and showing their chewed up food. This is the great Spielberg?!! Keep the barf bag handy... In its many components, it tries to have something for everyone and instead has nothing for anyone. Whats with this teddy bear, is it Disney? No cause it has sexual scenes such as the boys in the car being magically touched in the crotch. What is it? [junk]."
1,A.I. --The Movie,"Perhaps, perhaps the DVD version might save this movie!! Please don't waste your time buying it. My advice is to rent it first. You may only be able to get through it once. I am a HUGE Sci-fi fan and was excited to see this movie. I was soooooo disappointed in it. Some parts of did not make sence whatsoever... Sorry...."
5,Unfairly Treated,"I don't understand why this movie was so unfairly treated by the critics. Sure, at first I was turned off by the names Kubrick and Osment. But after finally watching this film, it definitely is one of the best I have ever seen. Great performances, great effects, great score. No, there isn't a happy fairy-tale ending here, but the ending, I think, is perfect for the film. I believe that in the future this one will be considered a classic."
1,2000 years - and it felt just like it !!,"Oh boy, what a boring movie! I resisted for the first 2 hours to press the fast forward but after that I could not take it anymore. The first half hour is not bad but after the imprint everything falls apart, the worst, falls apart v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y... I am filing this movie in the ""Worst I've ever seen"" category. And I've seen a lot! Do a favour to yourself and stay away from it. The best scene in AI is when the ""homeless"" robots dig the dumpster and get the best parts of other robots to build themselves. Oh yeah, that's pretty much what this movie is about. It takes the best part of other movies (Blade Runner, Mad Max, even Planet of the Apes) to make itself. And the result looks as bad as the homeless robots..."
2,a lot of talk about nothing,"I went to see this movie with great expectations, I mean Kubrick/Spielberg two of the greatest directors of out times. But I was really disappointed with it. It was too long, I almost fell asleep, the whole Kubrick's idea just disappeared in too many plots. Soemtimes it seemed like Spielberg didn't know what to do in some moments, especially in the end with the ""aliens"" I think it's really the worst of Spielberg's movies to date"
5,"""You know what you have to do.""","Incredible! The genius' of Spielberg and Kubrick meld in one of the ""weirdest"" films I've ever seen! Even though the film is fascinating, I don't believe that this film represents the end of the world (I say this as a Christian), but it is a great addition to Spielberg's line of films. Touching, dark and grim! Do not miss this one! Grade: A+"
1,Failed attempt at a good premise,"A good story should have one or more of these: a good story, moral lesson, or emotional content. Spielberg's AI falls short in all of these. The story could be interesting but is not told well. You feel some sympathy for the character but it is more pity than understanding. If it's showing somewhere on TV for free it's worth a look, but it's very long and doesn't keep one's interest enough to watch it till the end."
1,15-Minute Plot In A 2-Hour Movie,"Absolutely the worst movie Spielberg's ever done. An overused story line with a sappy moral and absolutely no humor or action. It's ""Water World"" meets ""Bicentennial Man"", so if you loved both of those movies, this movie might be for you. Personally, I would have found it more exciting and thought-provoking if Spielberg had simply filmed the two-thousand years ""David"" spends submerged staring at the statue of the Blue Fairy in real time."
5,The Empire 5 Star 500 - #1,"If you could spend one day with that person, how would you spend it? Excellent cerebral science fiction of the highest order."
1,This film was awful!,"I disliked this movie so much I wanted to write a negative review about it. I thought that the story was terrible and the acting wasn't much better. In the last 30 minutes I kept hoping that it would end, but it continued to drag on painfully. If you liked in in the theaters go ahead and buy it, but if you haven't seen it I would recommend renting and get some drinks because you'll have to be loaded to watch it."
2,"Overkill on the global warming, already","Global warming for breakfast, lunch, dinner and midnite snacks enough already! People shouldn't be brainwashed into thinking what the director/actors think that's called being a nazi. Just because you have the money and resources to manipulate people dosen't make it right. Everyone should have a basic right to be able to think for themselves (free will) remember? Anyway, the one star is for Jude and the other is for Haley. This was a very good idea but Steven turned it into a sap-fest as usual"
2,"Great photography, dull story","2 of 5 stars for the sci-fi movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Frankly, I'd give this movie a 1 of 5 stars, however, it is really well made with great photography and clean special effects, so it gets a 2 of 5. Set in the future where a company made a mechanical boy. The kid who played the robot did a good job. The story is insanely dull and excessively long at 2h25min. If they cut about 1h from the movie it would be OK and get a higher rating. Sorry, I do not recommend this movie; BTW, I lasted 1h30 before quitting for something else."
1,bad movie,"This movie was ver steroetypical. Though the graphics were quite amazing, the story was just horrible, and quite depresseing at times. The caracters wree very unlikable, and the constant annoyance of the kid almost made me want to get up and leave. This move was very poorly written, and just dragged on for the 3 hours or so. Speilberg tried to make this an epic movie, but he failed. I don't even reccomend renting it."
2,Ten things I learned from A.I.,"1. Humanoid robots can swim2. Steven Spielberg should stick to making movies about Killer Sharks and Giant worms, at least there's quality there3. The leather couch in my living room is good comfy enough for a good 141 minute nap4. Haley Joel Osment is only capable of rehashing past characters5. Contrary to popular belief, Spielberg CAN make a bad movie6. Parents can be ignorant enough to ignore rules about robot food consumption7. Robots can survive centuries into the future8. A single strand of hair is capable of human reproduction9. Every android movie must have a subplot about ""destroying"" the androids10. Spielberg won't make another movie like this again."
1,complete misfire,"This mess has no idea what it wants to be. Spielberg at his cutesiest and most annoying (yes, this includes the horrible Color Purple and ridiculous War of the Worlds). What WAS he thinking? And the cockatootie teddy bear. Give me a break."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.,"If I hadn't been with a large group of people when I saw this movie in the theatres I would have walked out. Absolutely rediculous.. it just gets weirder and weirder as it goes until you are thinking to yourself ""how on earth could this possibly have a happy ending, I mean unless space aliens come down in their magic space ship and... oh... really??""I was writing some reviews and having a little fun and I thought to myself.. what's one of the worst experiences I've ever had in my life? Oh yeah, when I went and saw that pinochio space alien movie.. I'll go give that pile a 1."
2,"Pointless, droll, depressing, unentertaining drivel.",I remember when Spielberg's name was synonymous with quality filmaking (I gave him a Mulligan for Close Encounters) but I think we've just witnessed the demise of one of our generations great directors. Seek the spotlight and the world has a way of humbling you. Karma dude! This movie sucks.
1,Get Real this Movie Sucked!,"How can you people even give this movie 4-5 stars. Come on the plot was choppy and the flow of the movie was slow. The kid wandered aimlessly. The conclusion is ridiculous, especially the way things are reolved. The last disasterous movie of this magnitude for Spielberg was 1941.My advice is rent the DVD at BlockBluster. If you like it, buy it. If not then you've saved [money] or spared yourself the annoyance of trying to sell this [stuff] on ebay to recoup your losses."
1,Masterpiece or Mess?,"When I saw ""AI"" in the movie theater I loved the first act -- I was completely ""there"" -- but by the time the 3rd ending rolled around, I was staring at my watch, more that bored -- I was mad! I felt manipulated, and I couldn hardly wait to get out of the theater. Masterpiece? I don't get it. The most interesting character is ""Snuggle the Fabric Softener Bear."" And one more thing -- I think most people would agree that if a child is lost and friendless, what should he do? Why, hang out with a male hustler, of course. Kubrick was a genius. Spielberg is brilliant. (And the story is fascinating.) But together, they've created a peanut butter & pastrami on raisin bread sandwich - somethimes things that are great separately don't fit together."
2,Not as good as expected...,"I purchased this movie hoping to see yet another spectacular Speilberg flick. Boy was it a let down. I suppose if I were a bit younger (Like 12 perhaps) I may have enjoyed it. It was very predictable and almost a paste together of a bunch of borrowed ideas. The Pinocchio concept was a bit far fetched, but it did make for interesting thought. Overall I was surprised at how bad the movie kept getting and wished it had ended 1/2 an hour sooner."
1,Good Idea Wasted on a Bad Movie,"The basic idea for this movie is excellent, and so are the special effects and the actor who plays David (Haley Joel Osment). However, the plot is more like a brainstorm of how artificial intelligence would affect the future than it is a story. The movie spends an insufficient amount of time developing the characters, and too much time preaching about the consequences of artificial intelligence. This film was frustrating because it could have and should have been much better than it was."
1,1 star for Haley's acting but the rest is a waste of money,"The movie is based on the Pinocchio theme. The acting by the young actor Haley Joel Osment was great and it was the only thing good about the movie. The story itself was very poor where the child robot and the adopting mother were subjected to a very emotionally challenging situation. The child robot is driven to a hopeless situation where it ends up jumping off a side of a building. As the viewer, we basically see a child try to commit suicide. I would definitely not recommend the movie if you have young children of your own. Steven Spielberg might have a lot of power when it comes to movie making but putting his name on the movie credits does not guarantee that you will be seeing a good movie."
1,SUCK is to VACCUUM as A.I. is to BLACK HOLE,"I cannot believe I wasted over 2.5 hours of my life watching this terrible movie. I was taken aback at the lack of creativity, as well as a total sham of a plot. The movie had no direction at all, it was nothing but a downward spiral towards the unsatisfying and completely lame ending. I am a serious fan of sci-fi and action, such as LORD OF THE RINGS and STAR WARS, however AI was completely blown out of the park by the mentioned films...Have a more enjoyable time drowning yourself."
1,Two hours and 20 minutes you will not get back,"Maybe I saw a different film from the people who actually liked ""A.I."", or maybe I should lower my expections. Either way, this movie was simply awful. It starts off silly and goes downhill from there. And just when you think it can't or won't get worse, it does. The acting was weak, the story was weak, the ending was horrible, and what's with that bear? I beg those who have not watched this -- DO NOT waste your time. It's too late for me, but it's not too late for you. Save yourself!"
3,Interesting but SLOW. Cool SFX,"Kubric had this thing for movies that move at a glacial pace. Speilberg obviously followed suit. I found myself using the FF button more and more. The really cool effects (sunken city, future race) didn't show up until the last 20 minutes. The plot is unoriginal, the acting uninspired, the action uneventful, and overall it's a bore. It's eye-candy with SOME interesting points. The only part I thought was worth it was the evolution of the Mecha. Even that got stolen from Asimov and Anime''."
2,More is Less,"Two famous directors, lots of big name actors, Great Special Effects, 140+ minutes... and you end up with this dreck?? Sometimes you can tell a big story in a small way..you don't need to span thousands of years, toss in a new evolved life form (unless your on UPN) and have honky tonk robot cities.. a smart story, script and believable plot would have worked out better."
2,Forgot to use the edit room?,Very long and for no good reason. The first half hour was OK with its human interaction but this soon ends and you have to sit through 1:50 minutes of robots and such to reach the finish line. At best Speilberg could have saved his movie and used a lot fewer special effects and tryed to keep a far more interesting plot going. Its just another low budget screen play that relies on just the visual effects.
4,"Unsettling and unforgettable, BUY IT!","This is an ambitious, visually stunning, thought provoking, ultimately disturbing film. I haven't been so moved by a film is quite a while. Flawed? Yes. Lengthy? Absolutely. But I'll be watching it again!Spielberg has the edge when it comes to pulling at our heartstrings -- I couldn't help but be reminded of Empire of the Sun. Haley Joel Osment is a REMARKABLE talent and should have had an Oscar nomination for this role!I was so moved by the themes in this film -- humans searching to fill emotional voids, mechas striving to serve a purpose, the ugliness and irresponsibility of our culture, the beauty of perseverence.Most of all I was moved by the child's unrelenting desire to be truly loved by his mother. It reminds me of so many children, neglected, abused, even abandoned, who hold out hope for the Blue Fairy.This is a parable to teach us about humanity and our responsiblity to the life we create."
3,This HD transfer to Blu-Ray is not too impressive.,"This movie was only released about 10 years ago. I can't believe how grainy it is for such a recently released film. I have movies on standard DVD that were released over 30 years ago, that look better than this Blu-Ray Transfer.Oh well, I guess I should rent Blu-Ray films before I buy them to replace my DVD. So sad, a disappointing effort to bring this film to Blu-Ray. Why bother to re-release it if there isn't going to some kind of improvement to the release?Oh well, live and learn."
2,Very disapointed!,"I wanted so much for this movie to at least be enjoyable, well it didn't even close. If you haven't seen this movie please rent it first and don't waste the $20 buying it."
4,A.I.,"Jude & Haley are frightenly robotic and believable and Teddy is fantastic. The special effects are amazing, but the script borders on cheese just as you think you're on a roll. If you want to watch Pinocchio, then watch this, but if you want a good sci-fi film go watch BladeRunner."
3,AI Are we ready for this??? I think not,I believe the message that this movie is trying to get accross is that we are headed for a disposeable society which will include people. Also do not mess with GOD'S work as we will only make our life worse. The movie it self is good and Haley is an excellent actor in this movie. Really you must watch this and see what we are doing to ourselves slowly but surely.
5,I Loved This Movie,"Steven Speilberg's Hunting Masterpiece is by far the best sci-fi film ever made and for good reason its vissuely stunning,mysterise,complex,beutifuly photographed,epic, and in the hands of a master. Stanley Kubrick would have produced the movie and Steven would have directed it at least thats what Kubrick wanted since he came up with the adpation of the novel the movie was based on. But Steven had to take the whole project over wants kubrick died(rest his soul) and I think kubrick would have loved the way the movie turned out. This is steven speilbergs masterpiece and a trbute to the great director."
2,When Woody dies maybe Oliver Stone can complete his film,"A truely horrible attempt. These two directors have nothing in common, and I have no doubt that Kubric is spinning in his grave over this one. Some of the special effects were SO cheesy - like the wolf-head motorcycles and the baloon shaped like the moon. Nice cinematography, beautifully shot, but a rambling, incoherent, overly-sentimental piece of dogy doo. One of the few movies to cause me to audibly groan in a movie theatre. (""And then...2000 years passed""...argh!)To the reviewer who compared those who didn't like this movie to their parents who didn't like ""2001""...huh? 100's of years from now 2001 will still be a classic while AI will be collecting dust along side Ishtar and Howard the Duck.Again, to review, a very bad film."
3,Pinocchio meets Blade Runner indeed...,"A drama in all the sense of the word, A.I. Artificial Intelligence, brings to the screen the story of a couple that adopts an android capable of love following their son going into a coma. Things become rather complicated when the young boy regains consciousness...The cast does a good job in their respective roles though its Haley Joel Osment that steals the show.The similarities with Pinocchio are evident and the film focuses on human relations, hope and inner strength, as well as love, devotion and integrity.Very serious and very slow at times it does not aim so much to entertain as to stimulate one's mind and emotions.Recommended for Haley Joel Osment (who is really great) fans and for those with a taste for depression in the extreme."
5,Tease of tech,This movie arrived in good condition. The movie was a great teaser of the nature of tech and the issues that arise from loosing the human aspect of relationships.
1,What a horrible movie! You'll pray for it to end...,"Despite this movie's fantastic effects and stunning visuals, this movie is absolutely horrible. Following the doomed life of a boy robot, this story continues inexorably towards an unsatisfactory ending. Indeed, there were several points in the movie where I was begging for the credits to roll. There are some particularly disturbing and heart-wrenching scenes, but even these moments are not enough to make the movie worthwhile."
1,Do yourself a favor; skip A.I.,"In all honesty, A.I. was one of the worst films I've seen. I was very disappointed to see that any of Kubrick's bright ideas were overshadowed by lengthy and excessively corny Spielberg scenes. I felt myself not caring about any of the characters and wishing the film would end (which it takes a very long time to do.) Finally, towards the end of the movie you are in for a surprise when you think that it is over and instead it launches into the final scene. This is when I turned from simply disliking the movie to utterly hating it. Please save your money and your three hours. And if you absolutely must see it, don't say I didn't warn you..."
2,Kids under the age of 15 should not go see this film.,"None of the reviews that I've read make a reference to another nuance in this film; the robots are treated the way our society treats others not deemed to be part of 'normal' society; the misfits, the gay people, the not so slim folks. The pool side scene with the kids made me cringe; I could imagine kids hassling a gay companion that way. Also: who in their right mind would allow a child to sit and watch the red necks pouring acid on etc. and other wise mutilating robots? I had to turn my face when the nanny was being murdered. Too much. This is Spielberg? I do not want to go see another one of his movies if this is characteristic of his work. I for sure would check a movie of his out before I would allow a child to see one of his."
2,What the?,"I'm sorry, maybe it's just me but I can't helping stating that this has to be one of the wrost movies I've seen in my life!Can you say boring? Can you say doesn't make sense at all? The first 30 minutes of the movie were O.K. But it went downhill after that. This movie is a prime example of a director attempting to make a deep movie with a meaningful lesson but failed on all levels. I don't recommend this movie unless you want to go to sleep or you don't have anything else to do."
1,"An awful, awful movie","Two things:1) This definitely goes on my personal 10-worst-movies list.2) The only good part of this truly, truly awful film is a close-up of Jude Law's eyes."
2,"uh, what... ?","It's difficult to believe this movie would have been released, in this form, at this length, with this ending had the name ""Spielberg"" not been attached to it. Yes, the film has a few bright spots - the visuals are quite striking at times, and Jude Law gives a wonderful turn as a robotic prostitute, but on the whole, the film just rambles (at considerable length) without going anywhere. It's a lot like a dream - filled with physical impossibilities, emotionally wrenching at times... but then, in most dreams, you don't have to wait 45 minutes for what you already know is going to be an unsatisfying ending. Better you should rent Disney's Pinnochio, or read the book... you'll get a better ending and possibly enjoy yourself."
1,Truly UNwatchable,"This is definitely being added to the top 10 Worst movies I have ever seen. There is nothing original about the entire story. It is a hodge-podge of plagiarism drawing from numerous sci-fi and fairy tales. To name a few: Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland, Robot Dreams, What makes this terribly bad is that these sources don't even seem to be disguised at all. It is like there is a blatant reference to all the original stories.The characters are extremely un-captivating, which leaves you with sense of not identifying with nor caring about their plight. But wait, it gets worse the lighting throughout the film is terrible. What should be lit isn&#65533;t and what should be dark is lit. It seems like the back ground was more important that the actors. I guess it was to draw the viewer&#65533;s attention away from the thin story line. I found myself just wanting the main character, David, just to die, or better yet rust away.Do yourself a favor, and save your money for something else."
1,YAWN!,"This movie is BORING. The story is trite and the movie should have ended atleast half an hour before it did. The DVD isn't worth it because the movie sucked. PASS on it. It's just not worth the money or the time. The only redeeming factor was the brilliant acting of Haley. He is a natural, but it can't make up for a bad script, 1-dimensional characters, and choppy pacing."
1,Boring,I saw this with my 18 year old son. I was so excited to see it due to all the hype. I was disappointed and wish I had just left before it finished. I have never done that before but we both agreed it was a waste of our time. It was long and not what I expected from the beginning. I took my son to see Tomb Raider and we both enjoyed it. I like the director just not this film.
1,This is not a Kubrick film,"This is not a Kubrick film. A Clockwork Orange and 2001 are Kubrick films. Casting a dark, brooding and a baleful eye upon humanity, Kubrick was a master moralist, depicting humanities excesses and the horrible extremes to which they could lead. While this movie has Kubrick undertones, it is after all billed as a combination of both Spielberg and Kubrick, the film quickly descends into a sugary, ET-ish drive to go home. Please do not desecrate Kubrick's reputation by listing this as his movie or claiming that this movie went over the audiences heads. Spielberg went straight for the heartstrings with this gooey, botch job of a good Kubrick idea."
2,"Love this movie, but the blu Ray transfer is poor!","I purchased the blu ray version with great anticipation as A.I. Is one of my all time favorite films and is noted for beingquite visually spectacular. Watching on a 1080 back lit led tv and blu Ray player, I was confused at times ..as it seemed that it might not even be a blu Ray transfer....very grainy, lacking the definition, color clarity, intensity and depth that a good transfer should possess. Also Amazon the reviews posted here Do not pertain to the blu Ray version and that is very misleading!"
3,A Robot Fairy Tale,"R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) (Penguin Classics)was the original tale of a robot with an heart.A robot with dreams and who can love, but is still a machineis a sci fi ideal.This film is sort of Asimov as Walt Disney:the 2000 th year ""blue fairy"" makes the robot boy Davida real boy for just one day.Somewhat contrived and sentimental compared to Star Trek's Datait is well filmed effects wise and the acting is pretty good as well.It is just maybe too Asimov...All the humanity is pretty much drained from it."
3,(You've heard this before) too long,"AI is a good movie, and it deserves some credit for that. Spielberg deserves some credit for making a movie that seems to follow Kubrick's vision.However, AI is too long. The plot gets ridiculous after the boy gets frozen in the ice - story basically becomes that of a totally different movie - I felt like I had woken up after having slept through 30 minutes of the plot. This movie could have been made much better, had the last 3rd been removed.As for DVD ownership - it's not worth it. Rent it and see it - the movie is done rather well. But it will leave you scrambling for the fridge way before it's over."
4,I liked it,"Artificial Intelligence is a great science-fiction movie.The actors act well.The movie is really realistic.Maybe the future would be like this? , there are still existential questions about his programming and whether the conclusion is a realization of the human condition, despite being a fabrication.It's never boring but it's sometimes confusing.The film not only documents the clash between man/machine, but the clash between Spielberg's and Kubrick's ideologies is also evident.The running theme with Spielberg is that, though flawed, humans are basically decent. Kubrick, as shown in his past films: 2001, Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket, forces the viewer to deal with the darker side of humanity. Human beings are not inherently evil, but are more than capable of acting without regard for their fellow man.Watch it!"
2,The only reason I watched this movie until the end was Teddy,"I loved Teddy, that is the only reason this bore of a movie held my attention. Pinochio meets wizard of Oz and robots. This movie was long, the ending stupid and somebody, please, tell me why if this robot kid is so smart, why did he sit in front of a blue statue for 2000 years? After the first hundred years would he not figure out that his wish waw no coming true. ."
2,"Emotionally stunted, dull and way too long","I really was hoping for a good time when I sat down with this movie last night. What I got was a complete waste of over two hours. While A.I. is visually interesting, the uber-depressing plot rambles here and there with no solid direction. I think this must have been a ""movie by committee"" where everyone involved threw in their ideas on what the characters should do and no one bothered to say ""No, that is silly"" or ""no that will make this movie even longer"". I was even underwhelmed by the usually fantastic music by John Williams. I think this is the first time I ever saw a movie with music by John where I wasn't enthralled with the score and couldn't walk away humming the main theme. This movie was a terrible dissapointment."
1,"Calling this film ""horrid"" would be kind","Speilberg had a choice to make. He could either make ""Harry Potter"" or he could make ""A.I."". Speilberg chose ""A.I."", and he chose wrong. ""A.I."" is not only long and boring but its' themes are pure plagarism from other and better made films. The film steals from ""Blade Runner"" and ""Bicentennial Man"", among others. In fact, if you've seen ""Bicentennial Man"" then you've seen a better film.A.I. is sappy, sentimental, boring, slow, depressing, and full of plot holes. Now, don't get me wrong, I enjoy sentimental and sappy stuff but this just simply stunk.The idea that the polar ice caps have melted and have flooded coastal areas, including Manhattan, works to the contast of the films' attempt to create a sense of reality..."
2,"Long, slow, and unabashedly melodramatic","Let me start with the ending first. This part was a total unnecessarily drawn out, and over emotional part of the film. I agree with another reviewer, stop the film when the boy finally finds the blue fairy. That was his goal throughout the movie. There were few moments of joy in this robot's immortal life, all the pain the we are forced to witness just makes you emotionally numb at the end and checking your watch waiting for the ending (if you haven't turned the movie off already). It started promising enough, with a good concept, but Spielberg made it too hard to bond with the little creature that was nothing but an embodiment of pain and loneliness. The film is visually beautiful, but without a strong story, it is an overall disappointment."
1,A.I. The Psuedointellectuals Triumph,"3 hours of maudlin drivel! With a transitory plot (staying nowhere long enough to finish a story), obvious and predictable ""tear-jerkers,"" this movie strives for meaning and misses. Speilburg's aim to explore prejudice and the human psyche comes off instead in a disgustingly dark pointless melodrama not fit to grace the worlds theaters, much less my movie rack."
1,Blade Runner/Mad Max/Wizard Of Oz/Pinnochio/2001 remixed,"Imagine all the above cut to ribbons, covered with ice cold water and stuffed in a food mixer, allowed to dry for three hours and re-stitched together. Well.....that's just about A.I. Spielberg proves what a mess he is capable of making of a poorly realised Stanley Kubrick project adapted from a feeble short story. I like Kubrick and Spielberg has made at least two great films. A.I. doesn't do justice to anyone or anything. All the above films were great and somehow brought freshness to old ideas. This film is a stale hotch-potch of all the above and hasn't an ounce of originality to it."
2,Opportunity Missed!,"The premise of the movie was good but after the first half it dissolved into unitelligible nonsense. Looks like the writer ran out of any ideas as to what to do with it at the end and dreamed his way into nothingness. Pinocchio is a much better story, has much more meaning (actually that isn't hardto do because this was very little meaning in AI) and is much more satisfying to watch. AI tried to be a modern-day (future-day) Pinocchio but fell flat."
1,Mission accomplished,"Typically, I try to watch a movie twice before forming an opinion.I couldn't bring myself to watch ""A.I."" again.Sure, the effort was there (unlike Spielberg's lazy ""Lost World: Jurassic Park""), but the movie didn't have clear sense of what it was trying to be. Was it a fairy tale? A dark twist on that genre? It alternated between polar opposites too drastically to be coherent, and managed to be boring all the while.Other elements came out of left field (""Then a thousand years go by and hyper-intelligent robots make everything all better!"") interrupting what little narrative flow there was. I like to be surprised, not flabbergasted.Another Steven Spielberg film, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" is my favorite movie, and one of the biggest blockbusters of all time. The consensus is that Spielberg has decided to stop making crowd-pleasing films.Mission accomplished."
2,Really creepy and manipulative.,"This is a retelling of Pinnochio that has great special effects and disturbing emotions. Rather than heartwarming and human, this film is rife with sadness and despair. I'm not advocating a happy ending; the pessimism that comes through the scmaltz is really the issue. Watch it when you're far away from depressants and you might just come away unscathed."
1,Artificial Intelligence? Exactly my point.,"Sentient viewers will recognize Speilberg is in way over his head when this dog opens with written text that explains its premise, then moves immediately into a scene in which a professor actually LECTURES us on the film's alleged theme. We are then taken on a formless, haphazard journey through a spectacularly ill-conceived future in which bad guys round up robots while floating around in moon-camouflaged hot-air balloons (yes, you read that right) and the general public congregates in outdoor arenas to watch glorified toasters get thrown into kevlar fans. The word ""assinine"" doesn't even come close. Towards the end of this flick we get the words ""Two Thousand Years Later"" superimposed on the screen, which is one of the best unintentional laugh-getters I've ever witnessed in a theatre. Thankfully, this turkey only SEEMS to last two thousand years. Without question, ""A.I."" is one of the worst big budget movies ever foisted upon the public."
4,Intelligence Revisited,"When A.I. came out it did not recive good reviews from the critics nonetheless Spielburg is always worth a look and I found the picture well done with a excellent special effects, especially in the creation of the various types of robots. There is some depth to the story and Osment's performance is first rate The additional features on the making of the film were good especially the included comments from Osment himself about his approach to the role. Those fans of Bi-Centennial man should like A.I."
1,"Promising, but........","The premise of this movie was quite good, which is obviously what compelled me to watch it in the first place. It started out quite well also, and it had a lot of promise to it. But there was just far too much that didn't need to be in the movie, and as a result, it dragged on and on. I fell asleep halfway through the movie, and found myself waking up thinking, ""It's still going? Please God, make it stop!!"" I finished the movie, torturous as it was, because I really hate stopping a movie before the end, no matter how horrible it was. But I will not be watching this again."
1,"Dark, Depressing Sci-Fi","This movie is ok. I forgot when I bought it how dark, depressing, and sad this movie was. The movies affects were really cool and a neat glipse of the future, but for me, it was a bit dark and seems to constantly just keep sliding down adn down into a sadder state during the film. It is a story about a kid robot (the first robot that is able to Love) who is later discarded by his parents. So starts his journey to find a blue fairy (fairy tale) which he never finds, to become human. The ending is sort of cool, but the movie from starting out on a positive note, jst keeps sliding down and making you more depressed and upset over this robots plight. It is an ok rent, but I wouldn't buy it unloess you are inot sadder movies and or a Sci-Fi bone in you. Even with my interest I will rarely ever watch this one."
2,Overwrought and overlong,"The film would have been just barely tolerable had they left the child frozen in the ice. Much of the film's imagery is beautiful, but the plot goes from fascinating to ludicrous rather abruptly (two-thirds of the way through). By the end the audience was laughing, what with the teddy bear that has miraculously saved a lock of the mother's hair and the valium-voiced aliens. And talk about Oedipal endings! Certainly an embarassment for all parties involved."
1,Grotesquely Manipulative,"Could have been a thought-provoking vehicle in the right hands. Unfortunately, this is an absolutely abysmal effort."
4,A great Movie that really makes you think,"This Movie was a real thinking movie. It made me think about what the world would be like when I'm older. It was a little odder then your averge movie, but it makes you think. Its very sad though. I had my hands on my face when I first saw it to stop tears coming out of my eyes. Its a very great movie. I really think its one of the best movies made."
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,"I had heard bad reviews about this movie but they were quickly extinguished. The movie is a tad slow at first but gets very good in no time at all. The special effects & music score makes the movie worth watching by themselves. HJO's acting is light years ahead of most adult actors. The viewer is completely engrossed in David's journey through centuries to find love and ""the blue fairy"". Also the movie raises deep moral questions about mankind and the creation of A.I. which I'm positive we'll deal with in the near future. A must see on DVD which does justice to the beauty of the movie. A future classic!"
5,David is Frankenstein's monster!,"I haven't read all 600+ reviews here but, I'm surprised not to have seen any mention of Frankenstein in the one's I have read. The Pinocchio comparison is obvious since it is in the movie. Consider that in the book Frankenstein's monster laments his existence throughout the book and is last seen in an icy world just as David laments his existence and spends eons in an icy world. The monster is in many ways more human than his creator; David is more human than anyone else in the movie. When David finds the place where he was created he becomes violent and destroys his other selves. It's been awhile since I read the book but I'm sure more comparisons can be made between the two even more so than Pinnochio. I think A.I. was excellent although the ending was flawed and probably should have ended with David frozen in front of the blue fairy."
4,Touching......................,"okay,I know you think:sci-fi movie,right?WRONG!!!!!!!!This movie may be about androids,but its really about,well,life...The story is incredible,but at the same time its dull,Its basically the story of Pinocio,You know wooden boy who wants to be real...Par of that is because in the movie his ""mother"" reads him the story of Pinocio,and when he's abandoned he searches for tha Blue fairy to make him real so that his ""Mother"" will love him,and like Pinocio he gets hooked up with some pretty shady characters...That's all I'll tell,You should watch this movie and make-up Your mind if You like it or not.....I recomend it!"
1,"UNBEARABLE FISH ODOR!!! Country LIfe has changed suppliers, so product that was WONDERFUL is not intolerable. :-(","I had been using this product for years as prevention for depression, stress, inflammation. I loved it! But, the customer service rep for Country Life told me in an email when I wrote to complain, that company has changed suppliers for this supplement.Now, when I take it, there is an unbearable fish odor that permeates all my clothes, bedclothes, hair, breath, etc. I was extremely upset to learn this product that I had relied on for so long is now being used with inferior, impure products. I don't use the word ""impure"" lightly; authorities on the subject of Omega3 supplements explain that it is only when the components of Omega3 supplements are not fresh that there will be a terrible fishy odor. When the fats that compose these supplements become rancid, they have this fishy odor.I have switched to another, even more expensive brand. (By the way: Country Life won't refund my money.)"
1,outdated product?,This seems to be outdated. The current product -with the same name and description- provides a higher ratio of EPA to DHA.
5,Paso a Paso: Level 3 Worbook,This workbook was received brand new and immediately. I highly recommend this seller and will continue to do business in the future.
1,Worse than not having anything,"I bought this a year or so ago to use in my shop. I build furniture and needed an extension cord with multiple outlets. Perhaps I received a faulty one but there are so many flaws I can't believe they all happened to mine.Forget about running more than 1 item at a time or the breaker trips and you will have to push the reset button until your fingers are sore to get it to reset.The case broke the first time it fell on a soft wood floor from 30"".Reeling in the cord you'll think there's a marlin on the other end.Cords don't stay in the outlet. The slightest pressure on the cord cause it to slip out of connection and you will need to go wiggle the cord to get it going again.All in all it is more work than plugging and unplugging from a standard extension cord."
2,Beware,"The Bayco 25-foot cord reel. Appears to work great. However, the black center on two of the reels that we have for our guild is broken. This makes it very difficult to reel up the cord. I think I will try the Wood brand this time as we need to buy 4 more.Bayco SL-755 25-Foot Cord Reel, 4 Outlets"
4,Contains lead and other harmful chemicals!,"Bought this item and I read off its label that it contains lead and other harmful chemicals, also to wash your hands after each use. How on earth would one remember to wash their hands every time such an item is used. Had to return it for this reason and cos it would be used around children.Its a good item(reason for the 4 stars) but if you can live with the chemical label then I recommend it, if not stay away from it."
2,Just waiting for it to break,"I bought this because I was tired of reeling up the extention cord by hand. This reel has a 25ft cord sure enough. But the shell is made from thin, brittle plastic. A very poor choie of material considering it has to hold a rather heavy cord. One or two small events and the outer case will be cracked and worthless. And then I will by another, but not this one."
5,Hit from 3 different handymen,I bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts. They seemed to be just what they wanted. They fit the bill for what I wanted to give as well. Highly recommend. Price was right too.
5,Bayco SL-755 Cord Reel 4 Outlet Review,"This product works well. Reel out and in functionality is simple. Short cord, but serves my need. I recommed this product to anyone who needs to have multiple temporary outlets setup quick and easy. Great price."
4,If you liked old Passport,"...you will be pleased with how consistent Doldinger remains. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was to leave some headroom for my all-time greatest albums. Relative to the '90s, however, and to most post-'70s fusion music, this is easily a top contender. Contemporary sounding but without that ""smooth jazz"" blandness you find on commercial radio, ""Paradise"" has inspired me to go out and buy all the old Passport records I can find. Amazingly, more than 20 years into his project, Doldinger manages to stay fresh and interesting without abandoning the sound and style that made Passport great in the 1970s. And from someone who thinks that most contemporary jazz went downhill starting around 1979, believe me, that's saying a lot."
2,"Too Much Gee-Whiz, Not Enough Story","I read a lot of military/techno thrillers in the Tom Clancy vein, so I was excited to pick up this book. I was barely able to get through it. I like ""tech"" as much as the next guy, but in this book Dale Brown seems to pile the technical details of weapons systems, satellites, and aircraft (and futuristic toys) on top of each other just to demonstrate how smart he is. The details frequently do little to advance the story.I found the characters to be without nuance. The ""good guy"" is always right, the ""bad"" guy is always wrong. Brown's depiction of how senior military officers behave towards one another is, in my view, far fetched. These are Generals, not boot camp trainees.All in all, a clever premise for a major military conflict that left me unsatisfied in the telling."
2,Patrick McLanahan saga is so predictable,"This is the second Dan Brown's book I have read. The first one is Fatal Terain, telling US conflict with China. The story line is so predictable. I kind of enjoy the military technology stuff, but honestly speaking it is a bit too long winded and it does not enhance the storyline. Dale Brown & Michael Creighton are much better writer who are able to infuse tech stuff seamlessly into the storyline and create a great suspense."
1,"Oh dear God, this man should not be allowed to write again","I can't actually quote the final line in this book, because I'd begin hurling -- but it goes something like: ""His hand touched hers on the controls of their Vampire bomber.""This garbage is like a Harlequin romance for military wannabes.Please stop, Mr. Brown. Haven't you already done enough?*Note Amazon's webpage is setup so that I was required to at least give this one star. I personally think somebody owes me a star!"
1,like most.............,"big name tech thriller authors, Brown has gotten to be soooo bad IMHO. They think just their name (Clancy etc) will be enough. Luckily I get it at the library!Plot is bad, characters lifeless, I didnt even care who won by the end!!!!!"
3,"Entertaing, yet a bit tiresome","This book is a very good story. I personally have never enjoyed High-tech battle books, but this book along with Air Battle Force are two very good High tech battle books that I recommend as a good read.Someone who is not very interested in the subject, or who doesnt have a very good imagination cant really enjoy this book.In this book, the author describes all of the weapons, and weapon systems very very much, which kind of got a bit tedious and dull. But overall the story was very good.As many others have already said, I agree that it is probably time for this storyline to be put to rest."
2,Not much of a documentary,"As a future Lake Tahoe resident, I purchased this video to see which area's were hit hardest by these floods. Unfortunatly, there is no naration and very little information as to where the video was shot. Some maps would have been nice. I was going to give this one star, but since it did show Lake Tahoe, which my wife and I adore, we gave it two stars. Mainly because of the scenery. Otherwise, this was a waste time."
2,Dry acoustic diminishes these recordings,"Unfortuntately, this recording is an example of 1960s sound engineering at its worst. The instruments are miked so closely and the sound is so bone-dry that the performances can scarcely be enjoyed. It's as if the quartet is sitting in a small room with those noise-reduction panels lining the walls, ceiling and floor.I recommend listeners look elsewhere -- there are plenty of recordings to choose from for these great pieces."
3,A Superb Broadway Performance,"This CD is an excellent recording of the rich songs from the broadway musical ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"". The Broadway show, which takes place in Paris at the time of the French Revolution, was delightful and I'll miss seeing the original cast immensly. The compositional artistry of Frank Wildhorn and Nan Knighton give these songs a touch or magic- especailly the libertine ""Vivez!"" and the comforting ""You Are My Home"". The French infleunce in some of the vocals and certainly in the storyline give this recording, and the cast, la joie de vivre! Vivez!"
4,Very Good,"This is an excellent soundtrack and an amazing show, but it does kind of lose you if you have not seen it. I am not suggesting that you not get it, but I am suggesting that you see it also, and then it'll make a little more sense. But, the voices are wonderful (almost as good as the present broadway cast), the music is touching and funny, and it is VERY creative. And who doesn't like ""The Riddle"" (track 14)?!?"
3,"great story, but the music lacks thematic unity","The ensemble numbers in this show are very full and moving, but it would seem that Wildhorn and Knighton's idea of thematic unity is throwing in the same song a couple of different times. I also thought Linda Elder sounded way too much like Barbara Streisand with a gurgling vibrado. Douglas Sills and Terrence Mann carry this show with tremendous passion. If you're a collector, this is a must buy, just expect a decent musical that displays flashes of brilliance, but is quite rough around the edges."
1,Just terrible,I bought the Concept Cast Album many years ago and fell in love with the music. Unfortunately my CD was broken and I decided to take a try on this recording. Andreas completely ruined it with her terrible vibrato and ridiculous accent. I'm getting a new Concept Cast Album and would highly recommend it over this recording - Linda Eder did a much better job!!
3,"Much promise, but imperfect","I really wanted to like this this recording. It wasn't as bad as a 2, but they don't have 1/2 star to hit the 2.5 I would give it.When I first plugged it in, the opening passed and I heard ""Madame Guillotine."" What a song! Fantastic! If the rest of the show followed suit, this would be a blockbuster. Unfortunately, the rest of the show quickly peters out, with an endless string of soundalike ballads that begin to wear on the ear. Wildhorn does little to mix things up and provide some rhythmic variety (well, except for Wildhorn's take on Men, Men, Men, Men...) It loses all its personality. The songs are good, but if there was just one per act in that ballad style, they would probably stand out as emotional high points. Here it just drags the listener into disinterest. This musical has potential, but it will never be a big hit until it's restructured and rescored."
5,Absolutely Wonderful Musical,"I love this CD of The Scarlet Pimpernel. I think Terrence Mann does a wonderfull job in the role of Chauvelin. And Douglas Sills does equilly wonderfully as the ever-elusive Scarlet Pimpernel. I love certain songs on this CD the most. Those would be "" Falcon in the Dive "" "" Prayer "" and "" Where's the Girl? """
5,Wonderful memories.,The inspiring and lyrical music of The Scarlet Pimpernel is as beautiful as remembered. Sound quality excellent and evokes wonderful memories.
5,"Wildhorn's second musical brings you ""Into the Fire!""","This Cast Recording is by far, my favorite out of all the recordings released for the 97-98 bway season. Wildhorn's music is spellbinding, the lyrics strong, and the musical production is sharp. The talent on the recording is out of this world as well. Douglas Sills, Sir Percy/The Pimpernel himself showcases his amazing talents for the first time on a Cast Recording. Terrence Mann's rich baratone that audiences have grown to love through past roles such as Broadways original Javert in Les Miserables and Beast in Beauty and the Beast meets and possibly rises above his own standards as Chauvelin, the ""villian"" in this piece. Christine Andreas is also equally captivating as Marguerite, Percy's French wife. This recording's truly one that deserves its place on the shelf next to Les Miserables and Phantom!"
1,Absolutely amazing,"As momma used to say:You can dress a pig up in beautiful clothes, but it does not make her a lady.(I've given it one star, because there is no option for zero stars)"
5,The only play you'll ever need to see on Broadway!!!!!!!,"This play and recording is superb, it's on my CD player constantly!!!!"
3,Didn't quite click for me...,"After listening (and loving) Jekyll and Hyde I was hoping for yet another great find in Scarlet Pimpernal. Maybe it's just me but the music just didn't really click as much as other musicals have for me. SOme of the songs such as ""WHere's the Girl?"" and ""YOu are my home"" were very beautiful and I really enjoyed them. Terry Mann was excellent as the villian of this story(I can't remember his name!) and his song ""Falcoln in the dive"" was fantastic.Maybe I just have to see this musical or something to be convinced. I won't put it down and I would say my rating is more of a 3.5 stars. However I really could go either way with this one."
2,"Not nearly as good as the ""Concept"" recording","This recording has two faults. It is missing two of the best songs, and it is missing a leading lady. Let me set one thing straight, Linda Eder's (Concept recording) singing puts Christine Andreas' voice to shame. Ms. Andreas must have gotten the part because she is a good actress. A diva she is not! Her ""crooning"" lacks the power, control, and beauty that Ms. Eder's voice exudes. I suffered through Ms. Andreas' performance on ""When I look at you"" just hoping she would sing her way into the number. The singing was flat and powerless.I will never understand why the Broadway version has taken out the two best numbers (""I'll forget you"" and ""Now When the Rain Falls"") Maybe, they were not suited very well for the stage.Don't let this review stop you from seeing the show! However, if you want a recording, buy the earlier one!"
3,great musical,I loved what I was able to hear of this CD. I had to return it and the replacement sent due to both copies being deficive.
4,"Christine Andreas, Terrence Mann and an underrated score","THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL made history as the first Broadway musical to be re-tooled and re-cast during its run, following scathing reviews and waning box-office. This album features the original Broadway cast, headed by the lovely Christine Andreas.Frank Wildhorn's score contains a veritable treasure-trove of delights including ""Where's the Girl?"", ""The Creation of Man"", ""The Riddle"", ""You Are My Home"", ""When I Look at You"" and ""Only Love"". ""Storybook"" looks set to remain a constant in the repertoire of every self-respecting cabaret singer.The cast includes Terrence Mann (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST), Douglas Sills (LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS) and Christine Andreas (OKLAHOMA!). THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL is a fine musical and is worthy of a production that will do full justice to its sparkling score."
4,Scarlet it is,Too bad this show hasn't gotten the praise it deserved. Enjoyable music and great voices.
5,this musical had it all,"Hello i just saw this musical this weekend and it was one of the best musical i ever saw. it had everything: good singing, good acting and the comedy was even good. so now i'm gonna buy the cd. So when your in nyc and you have a musical on your mind go see the scarlet pipernel and as the commercial says ""bring your mother""."
5,The music becomes part of you...,"The Scarlet Pimpernel is so rich and lyrical, and the story is so compelling, it has become part of who I am. Delivered by a magnificent cast, the music is visceral. Take a ride on the ""Carousel"" and go ""Into the Fire."" Vive'!"
5,You will listen to this over and over....guaranteed!,"I have given this cd to my wife, my daughter, my Mom, my friends....a classic that you'll NEVER tire of listening to and sharing with others. I was not a big fan of Broadway Musicals...this cd changed me completely. Great melodies coupled with powerful lyrics....The Riddle and Where's The Girl should be both be number one hits on the adult contemporary charts....and Into The Fire is a classic that is now being sung by The Green Berets as one of their theme songs - it's that powerful.If you only buy one album this year....buy this one. You will listen to it over and over...and over again."
5,Excellent!,"This is one of the greatest musicals that I've seen and heard in twenty years. Nothing is comparable to Terrence Mann's amazing solos on Falcon in the Dive and Where's the Girl. The story is beautifully told through the music, and I recommend this title to anybody who enjoys listening to beautiful singing and wonderful lyrics."
5,Why Is It Not More Popular?,"I was looking for a show to perform in our local theatre, and came across this gem. It's fantastic! I love all the songs, they are so emotional, you can hear the performers singing with their hearts. And yet it is funny too, and the bouncy numbers are so catchy I was singing them at work after only a couple of hearings. I can't believe I've never heard of it before - more people should know and enjoy this fabulous CD. Buy it now - you won't regret it."
5,We Seek Him Here....,"Frank Wildhorn can really pen a tune. This is one of the best newer musicals to hit Broadway, and the soundtrack is breath-taking. There are some amazingly sensitive songs in the midst of this no-nonsense action-packed musical, particularly, ""When I Look at You"" and ""Only Love."" Mr. Wildhorn has not written a bad song yet, nor do I believe that he is capable of doing so. A must-have for your Broadway collection to open your ears, heart, and imagination."
1,Not worth the money,"I should have known better then buying this flute, haven't seen any good reviews. I didn't want my daughter to have a good flute in case she didn't want to stay in band so I got this one. I was hoping it would last her longer then it did. When she first got it I couldn't get it to play right myself. I thought it was me since I haven't picked up a flute in a good 10 years. She took it to school and it got worse over time. She's had it since Jan, it's not Aug and with school starting back I'm in the market for a new flute.Moral of the story, if you're in the market for a cheap flute for the kids to decide if they want to play...don't get this one!"
1,Junior High School SF,"This book is at the top of my list of the worst SF I have read in the last 10 years. If you like really simple SF then maybe it is for you. This proves my theory that whenever you see ""Story By Someone"" in big letters and then in little letters you see ""Novel by Someone Else"" it is a waste of time. I'm mad at my self for buying it."
2,"bad screen play, worse book","What a disaster. Take a screenplay that was never produced because (I assume) it is formulaic and all of the humor is based on racial stereotypes. Then give it to an author who can't write prose and has no idea what character development is. Net result: ""A very strange trip"" is a very bad book."
4,A Very Strange Trip is Quick and Entertaining,"Well, I bought A Very Strange Trip last night, and finished it today around 3 in the afternoon. It's a quick read, and very entertaining. Wolverton does a great job keeping you wondering what is going to happen next. This novel is based on a screenplay written by L. Ron Hubbard. If you're looking for entertainment, but don't want to spend 2 weeks waiting to find out what happens, this book is for you. I really enjoyed it."
1,Pointless Purchase,"I thought I was doing good when I purchased this for my boyfriend for Christmas after my old housekeeper robbed me and stole his computer he'd left over as well. He really tried to make it work, but this laptop is worthless. He can't do anything with it, it's so slow you can't browse the internet, plus it was kind of yellow and ugly. I figured it wouldn't be the fastest thing, but I thought it would be usable. Not so much. Buy a new Macbook, and save yourself the money."
3,3d ultra pinball nascsar v thrill ride v creep night,"Okay, so I've been checking out lots of pc-pinball tables. This is:1) entertaining, but unrealistic.2) very similer to NASCAR 3d pinball, and Sierra 3d pinball, as well as pinball 'Thrillride'(Hershey Pensylvania pinball).Same engine, Nascar version being the best (based on demo), Thrillride being the one I bought.3) Cool, as long as you dont compare it to: Wildsnake, or Cunning Development (co.) pinball.I've only played the shareware demo.Buying from amazon is (now) cheaper than getting a copy on the web.1) A cool game, but better ones are out there.2) no longer supported by the manufacturer. (shame, shame)3) very fun, but unrealistic. If you like ghosts and goblins, this has 'em.enough said... *WUKI*"
5,creep night,great pin ball game with a lot of options. Music is a little loud even though I have it as low as I can go..
1,Truely Awful,"I thought this book was going to help me develop my psychic skills, learn ways to improve my intuition and perhaps some meditation to relax, and open the way.It did none of these. It was full of hearsay - little tales of other peoples' experiences, things that had happened to them and written as if aimed at a 6 year old.I found myself reading on, desparate to get to the bit where it came to how you actually talk with spirits. My heart sank every time I put the book down. Yet another waste of time, and more little stories of people I don't know.Don't waste your time with this one, but if anyone can recommend a book that does help you develop your skills, please let me know!"
3,How to Communicate with Spirits,"This book was an okay read. Nothing really new to me when I purchased it about 10 years ago. I think it should've included some important points that would help a great deal of people in Spirit Communication. But I guess from a Spiritualist standpoint, she appeared somewhat limited on this fact to me."
1,TOTALLY WORTHLESS,The author totally lacks substance for this interesting subject.The only good part of this book is the title which is totally misleading. Anyone who contacted a spirit after reading this book is dead themselves. There are other great books on this subject which actually challenge your thought process. This book challenges nothing and offers nothing. The spirits are even laughing at this one.
4,A good book for you to understand your feline partner!,"Book Contents:1. Introduction2. Why is a cat...?3. Breed Behavior4. Your Cat's Territory5. Hunting Behavior6.Maternal Behavior7.

This book is informative. It also contains some unique point of view. The reason I only rate it as 4 stars is, I prefer a more human touch (sensation, humor) on cat topic books."
4,A Pleasant Informative Read,"I have to say that I have a fondness for this book. It reminds me of the books I read as a kid, especially Funk & Wagnall's Animal Encyclopedias. It covers a wide range of topics such as kitten development, territorial behavior, cats and people, playing. It's like an overview of the cat as an entity with a light scientific/psychological/behavorial flavor...."
5,It was great! It has been ages since I laughed this hard!,This book was a creative copulation of jokes. There is something for everyone in this book! I love to bring it out at parties. It is always guaranteed to bring a laugh!
5,WOW,"This is an awesome book because the author is able to maake her characters come alive. The character of Makenna is interesting because you don't always agree with every thing she does. However, If there is no sequal then it may not be quite as good to some people. Is there a sequal?"
4,A great book!,"I loved this book. I can sympathize with Makenna, and with Tobin and of course, the goblins.This is one of the best books I have ever read, but the ending left me wanting more."
5,A true exhibition,"Pictures at an Exhibition is of course wildly popular in its orchestral version but, great as Ravel's version is, after listening to the original piano version played by Horowitz you will realize it is even better. This is Horowitz at his absolute peak, playing at times with a demonic intensity that is frightening, a technical perfection that is astonishing (the crescendo and decrescendo as the ox cart approaches and then slowly rumbles off is utterly profound and evocative), not to mention a sense of beauty. The finale is so remarkable it sounds like an entire room of pianos is playing. For 1941 the recording sounds remarkably good, although of course it is not as clear as a modern digital recording."
5,"Hello, Baby","ISBN 0026887509 - If there is (and no one really thinks there is) such a thing as an ugly baby, he or she is not to be found in this book. 12 thick, board book pages of close-up photographs of some of the cutest babies, doing what babies do, with captions describing the action. Crying, clapping and more. Babies will love looking at the pictures!- AnnaLovesBooks"
4,An interesting modern piece of music,I bought this after hearing the Lutoslawski piece at a concert. It is a very dramatic piece and I loved it. My wifewould be happy to never hear it again. Rostropovich's performance was excellent but the audio mix was very different from the live performance I attended. The percussion and brass were much more dominate in the live music. I'm happy I bought it but some will be happier to avoid it.
2,This Cheerleader Doesn't Make the Cut,"We got this for my 3 year old daughter in follow up to the Bella Princess which she absolutely loves and has played with fairly consistently for a year now. Comparatively Bella Cheerleader is a huge flop in our house. Not nearly as visually interesting for this age group. She literally lost interest within 5 minutes. The box advertises for ""3+"" but I highly doubt many 3 or even 4 year olds would be very engaged by this. Maybe older girls would enjoy it but I'm not even sure of that. FYI - the baton is great for throwing at older brothers. If your litle girl likes to cheer buy her some pom-pons from the dollar store and save your money on this one."
5,pentax dl17 lithium ion battery for optio 555 camera,first battery that came would not accept charging so was returned.2nd battery works fine.would recommend using branded battery and not generic as my son purchased the generic which didn't make good contact and power would stop periodically.
1,HUGE disappointment!,"I was totally disappointed. I read the whole book and was still waiting for the information that would let me know that our pets are in spirit and wait for us in heaven. I felt that Mr. Kurz continually appologized through the whole book every time he mentioned a more spiritual way to look at this subject. For example he brought up some Eastern philosophy, but appoloqized that he didn't really believe in it, and the idea that our animals can really talk to us through mental and emotional feelings. And because he is a bible study teacher, he continually appologized to everyone that he would mention something that would not be directly explained in the bible. It made me think he was not too confident in anything he wrote in the book to begin with. There are many books available that are written by animal communicators, and other spiritual people that definitely give you more hope and understanding on this topic."
4,Sound help for those who grieve,"This book is comforting and eye-opening. Gary Kurz does a great job explaining what the Bible says (or does not say) about animals living beyond death. His exegesis and reasoning are sound. I appreciate that he offers a sensible counter to the opinions I was taught but could never accept. In his writing, I sense the same deep love for animals and for their Creator that I have. My only complaint is a rather rambling writing style. I'd definitely recommend this one to those who may be grieving a furry friend."
4,Feeling Better Read,"This wonderful book helped me through a difficult time the last couple of months. If you need some help after the loss of your pet, this book will do that."
5,"Cold Noses offers hope, insight and inspiration!","Gary Kurz has done a beautiful, insightful sharing of ideas in Cold Noses At The Pearly Gates, and that sharing brings comfort to every parent who has experienced the loss of a furry child! By use of scripture, the author brings to light how important all of God's creatures are to Him, and the certainty that they will join humankind in heaven. Readers well versed in scripture will still be surprised and delighted at the fresh outlook this book supplies! Interspersed with endearingly humorous anecdotes about the author's pets and other animal friends he has known, the book is entertaining as well as enlightening. For anyone who has grieved over the loss of a pet, comforted a friend who has lost a pet, or knows that the death of a pet is inevitable, it is a must read, and a blessing."
1,Author argues creationism but knows nothing about evolution.,"I picked this book up thinking it would be something that I, a total pet lover, would enjoy. I'm glad I scanned some pages, I could not get past his insistence on creationism, his (as another reviewer said) passive aggressive attacks on people who do not believe it, i.e. ""papa Darwin"", and lastly one sentence about evolution stating that it contains the words ""should"", ""may"", ""could"". He also states he has studied the theory extensively, and in the next sentence says that it promotes survival of the strongest. This shows me he has studied nothing, and brings the baggage of creationism to the table. ""Survival of the fittest"" does not by any means mean ""strongest"", it means the most adaptable (i.e. the most fit to survive in a particular environment). His intentions may be good, but he's totally off the mark in proving his point."
3,A Very Gentle Book - But more reserch needed,"I enjoyed Gary's personal experiences. It was obviously written for the Christian leader so those who complain it was too Christian I can't symphasize, by the title you should be able to tell it was for Christmas. I only wish he had used more scriptural references as reasons to believe animals will be in heaven. He seems more interested in converting people to his beliefs rather than using scriptures to back up what he says. They do exist. He also makes statements to which there is not basis in the scriptures such as animals and plants not having spirits but uses no scriptures to back that up."
2,Good for very religious pet owners not for the grieving.....,"Unfortunately this book was not for me. The author spoke more of Gods ""word"" than of the grieving pain I'm feeling for the loss of my beloved ""Mariah"" (beagle). He spoke more of scriptures in the Bible, which don't get me wrong are wonderful but I didn't see how his interpetations of the bible were helping me to get through my pain. At the end he speaks about loving your pet and taking care of them......Why does that matter? My dog is now gone. I guess I was hoping that I would read more about grief, and the presence of my dogs spirit and knowing that I would see her again. Unfortuantely, I didn't ""feel"" any of that from reading this book."
3,Too Fundamentalist Christian,"I solidly applaud Mr. Kurz's efforts at eliciting solid evidence from the Bible for the existence of pet soul, however, for any one who has had any training in Bible Scholarship, this will not work well. Mr. Kurz has based his arguments on literal applications of biblical text. Anyone who belongs to a Mainline Christian denomination and who studies the Bible and books on the Bible will not find this book helpful, other than in intent.I give him 3 stars for his big warm heart and for the effort but he would have done well to go to his local mainline seminary and start some conversations with professors of theology, eschatology, and biblical criticism. To date there is no book that has done this and Heaven knows those of us who minister to educated readers of the Bible, who lose beloved animal companions, desperately need one."
1,Hated it.,"This book is nothing more than a preachy, highly insensitive and seemingly never-ending rambling-on by some self-righteous know-it-all blowhard. Clearly, the book is intended only for people of the Christian faith, and being agnostic I found it to be a load of rubbish. Get ""Animals and the Afterlife"", by Kim Sheridan instead. It's a much better read."
1,Very disappointed,"I have been in so much pain over the loss of my pet, that when I received this book I couldn't wait to get started reading. I was so disappointed. I might as well picked up the bible. Gary Kurz didn't tell me anything I hadn't heard at Sunday school. I needed comfort not a lesson in religion. I am hoping the other books I have ordered will be of more help. If you were looking for comfort from the loss of your beloved pet don't bother to get this book."
1,It didn't answer the right question.,"I struggled halfway through the book hoping the author would eventually give the ""hope"" as stated in the sub-title, which at this point he did not. As another reviewer stated: I should have checked other reviews before I bought the book. It's not worth the money or the time to finish it. There are so many other books out there, but I kept reaching for the one which would give me comfort after my dear companion died last week. I'll quit looking and find my comfort within my heart."
2,Cold Noses at the Pearly Gates,"The intentions behind this book were honest and sincere. He seems to be a very caring person. However, he spent a lot of time rambling on about things that related only to him and sometimes got way off course! He also spent a lot of time apologizing for his views before he even gave them. He needs to study the difference between the words ""then"" and ""than""! Got those mixed up a few times! If he got an editor, a publisher and an illustrator, I think he could have a best seller on his hands! Also, constant references to answering the scriptural questions in his next book was distracting as I felt this book was supposed to answer those questions. I was looking for scriptural ""proof"" and instead got a lot of rambling on, apologizing, and was pushed towards buying his next book ""if I really wanted the answers""."
2,Comforting Rather than Convincing,"I should begin by saying that my viewpoints and worldview tend to be more liberal than this author's. For example, I do not believe in the Creationist's viewpoint literally or believe that the Bible is word for word the word of God, although I do accept its basic message and teachings. With that said, I do think the author genuinely loves animals, and I thoroughly enjoyed his anecdotes and stories, as well as his down to earth writing style. Everything he says is meant to comfort and reassure, and the overall message is one of compassion. Those who do have a more fundamentalist bent may find the ""Bible evidence"" convincing, but I was more comforted by the author's conviction than convinced by the ""evidence."""
5,A GEM!,"This may not be nice to say, but I found my first copy of this book at a yard sale and bought it for ten cents. It had a catchy title and so I thought ""what the heck"". I was so happy to have found this book. You know what they say, one man's trash is another man's treasure. In this case it was true. I loved this book. But I read it at a time when I really did not have a need to. My Gunther (my dog) was doing fine. However, recently, we lost Gunther and we were just devastated. I remembered Gary's book, but I just could not find it anywhere. Well, I found it again on Amazon and purchased a copy, not for ten cents, but at any price I had to have another copy of this little book. God bless you Gary and thank you for writing."
5,Cold Noses and Cold Noses II review,"Words fail to convey the comfort I received from these 2 books as I attempt to deal with the immense loss of a dear cat of 14 years. Well, not really loss, as I do know, thanks to Gary Kurz, that God cares and has provided for my beloved animals, that they were His idea first, that they are safe and at rest, no longer sick and in pain,and that they are in the presence of their and my Creator. I grieve that he is no longer with me but I rest in the hope of seeing him and all the others again, even though as Gary says, each one leaves a hole in our hearts when they go."
3,after reading Wagging Tails in Heaven i requested this,I was slightly disappointed because if i had read this first and thenWagging Tails in Heaven i would have been even more disappointed because-Wagging Tails in Heaven was well written but it was more or less a reproduction of this book with just a few added thoughts that I really needed to satisfy my soul.
3,Don't Waste Your Money,"This Is Just A Ok Book, It's Not What I Thought It Would Be, Maybe Someone Out There Will Like It, I Passed It On To Someone Eles In Goodwill."
3,Grieving over a cat.,"This book was reccommended to me when I had to put my 19 year old cat to sleep due to cancer. Although I didn't agree with all of the author's interpretations of the Bible in general, I did find his research relevant to animals in Heaven very comforting. I got the book from the Library and read it before I bought it and the main reason I bought was because of the 30 days of meditations at the end. I really wanted to have my own copy and am very glad I bought it. I received it in good condition and promptly."
2,Religious. Heaven afterlife.,"This book is about the loss of pets and afterlife. If you are religious, you may find comfort in the book. If you think our pets will meet with us in heaven, you may like the book. I couldn't read all of it. I cried too much and the book went into the bookshelf. I found more solace in Gary Kowalski's ""Goodbye, Friend"". I get that book out for relief more than any other. In Cold Noses at the Pearly Gates, the writer Gary Kurz states that God knew what he wanted to do in regard to creation, had the power to bring His plan to pass, created a perfect environment, created man in a perfect state of spirit, mind and body, created perfect animals to share perfect mankind's perfect domain, and intended for this perfect situation to continue forever without death for either human or animal. (pg. 32). What happened to that perfect world?Too much on religion and too little on loss. I'll let you draw your own conclusion."
1,No comfort at all....,"I thought that this book would be inspiring but instead I am left with the biggest headache I have ever had. His disection of all things and all part of religion, spirit, souls, creation, evolution were just exhuasting. I felt like I was back in college reading a dissertation on life and religion!!! This is NOT a book that will help guide you through your grief, it will not bring you comfort or teach you how to cope it will instead cram theories into your brain to make you feel that through all of this research that has been done by Kurz via the bible that your animal is in heaven. Look.....either you believe your animal is in heaven right now or your don't. You don't need to read this 300 page theory overload to find that answer. For me I already know my beloved dog is in heaven, no need to read this book to convince me of that."
1,Downhill after the title,"If you believe every word in the Bible is gospel, don't mind improper sentence structure and lousy grammar, and are willing to pay to read someone's circuitous ramblings, this book is for you.The title is wonderful. If only the author had stopped there."
5,Gentle encouragement to the newly bereaved,"Gary Kurz's book gave me such comfort in those early days of my loss. It gave me the courage to once again have hope of seeing my precious Khiori again. And it gave me the courage once more to search the Bible for what God said rather than man.Thank you, Gary Kurz, for writing ""Cold Noses at the Pearly Gates"". It has meant so much to me and so many others. We become so attached to our pets, loving them unconditionally and being loved so unconditionally - it's hard to think God doesn't too. And now we have courage thru your book to continue to search God's word bravely for what He has planned for His creation - not what mankind has dictated He will do with His animals."
2,author should stick to non-controversial topics,"I was initially very excited to see the title of this book and the subject matter. I was very disappointed, however, to find that the author decided to address the topic of evolution as part of his justification for his ideas. There was no reason to insert this controversial topic into this book. After reading the author's opinion on evolution, which I disagree with, I was totally turned off and could go no further in the book."
5,A must reading for anyone that has lost a pet.,Our beautiful Tisha (Blonde Lhasa Apso) passed on after 13 wonderful years with us. Our kids are grown and gone so she was our baby. Gary's book helped a great deal in easing the painful emptiness. Now we know for certain that our pets are in heaven waiting for the joyous reunion when we will join them.
1,Beware -- for Christians Only,"I bought this book because I was devasted by the loss of my cat, and was hoping for comfort. What I got was the opposite -- a preachy religious book obviously for Christians only (of which I'm not). I could have dismissed it as a helpful book for those with the same beliefs, but one part of the book extremely distressed me. The author claims that all pets go to heaven, but if you are not Christian -- you won't go to heaven and therefore you'll never see your pets again.Now thankfully, I'm strong enough to see this for what it is. But it was extremely upsetting to see that in a book that people are buying because they are desperately looking for comfort. To tell non-Christians that they'll never see their pets again when they are already devasted is insensitive and cruel.If you share the authors religious beliefs, you will probably find comfort in this book. If not, you'd probably be best to avoid this book."
5,It was Gods answer to my prayer and gave me hope,"...Gary Kurtz's book was a gift from God. He loves animals as much as me and he has dedicated his life to searching out Gods eternal plan for these precious gifts we call ""pets"". It comes through in his words and his message. If you need biblical answers to this question, Pearly Gates is the answer.e I know that if you read this book, your heart will be touched and you life will be blessed. Mine was!"
5,Glad I found this book,"I am glad I found this book. I searched all over the internet[...] There is a lot of other good stuff there too, but I wanted this book - and am glad I found it - it helped me with my grief and gave me comfort."
3,interesting,"interesting opinions from the author, I felt some of it a ""bit over the top""....but the day we had to put our beloved 15 year old ""schnoodle"" to sleep, I was inconsolable, and spent a fortune on line looking for books that would maybe support my ideas & thoughts, especially Scripturally, that we could see our pets again when it is OUR time to go to Heaven..."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"ALTHOUGH THE TRANSACTION WITH AMAZON WENT SMOOTHLY & THE SELLER WAS WONDERFUL--THIS BOOK WAS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED. IT RAMBLED, WAS TOO FULL OF SENSELESS DETAIL & WAS HARD TO FOLLOW IN SOME AREAS. THERE WERE SOME THOUGHTFUL IDEAS & SOME OF THEM GAVE ME FOOD FOR THOUGHT. NOT A BAD READ--NOT A GREAT READ EITHER."
5,"Thank You Gary..... in honor of ""Pupster"" I will help others","I lost my beloved toy poodle, ""Pupster"", on March 7, 2002. Gary's book has provided me with great comfort in my devastating grief. During such a difficult time, many question their faith and beliefs, and Gary helped to provide the reassurance I need to start rebuilding my life without my companion by my side, at peace in knowing that one day we will be together again forever. I have purchased two more books to donate to my veterinarian's office as an act of kindness in honor of my beloved Pupster. I know that future grieving recipients will read Gary's book and find the same wonderful comfort I did as I turned each page."
5,AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ!!!,"There are so many Christians out there that simply do not believe that animals will be in Heaven after death. They believe that the animal will just cease to exist and shake their heads in disapproval if an attempt is even made to consider the thought of a beloved pet going to Heaven. Mr. Kurz gives a different view that is made from endless amounts of searching, praying, and studying. He listened to God and this is what He told him. If you want to know the truth about your beloved pet and eternity, read this book. It is an absolute must read!!!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"Wagan 2 Million Brite-Nite Spotlight LanternNot Bright Enough. ""I had a 1 million for Years that was brighter.I owned this one less than three months, smelled something electricial. After checking where the power source plugs into the spotlight, it was WAY TOO HOT. I was afraid to use again.Thank you Amazon.com for working with me to purchase a different spotlight.After taking such great care of this product, having to purchase another so soon is unreal!J K SNC"
1,Waste of Money,It has all the features anyone would ever need but the battery didn't last 6 months. Had to throw this nice looking piece of junk in the trash.Don't waste your money on this!
1,Worked for about 2 months,"Over time things stopped working. Switches started to fail and the battery would not charge. Feels like an empty piece of plastic. My LED Maglight is about 4 times brighter and about 4 times smaller. This is a 2 million ""bright-nite"", not a 2 million candlepower. Putting a 2 million in the name will not make the light brighter."
1,Junk,This lasted less than 6 months - not worth the money. The LED still works but the spotlight is dead.
1,DP,"I received the light on time as promised. I followed the instructions regarding charging the battery and the light did not work. I would recommend not purchasing this item. Returning the light will only be ""salt in the wound"""
1,Piece of junk,"The battery life was poor even when it took a charge, and now the battery is completely dead. Worst flashlight I've ever had. Based on others' reviews about the brightness, it sounds like they were being deliberately misleading with the name. I'll never buy any of their products again."
4,"Lightweight, but not as bright as you'd think","With most lights being rated in ""watts"", it is hard to figure out how bright of a spotlight I wanted.My goal is simple: we camp a lot, and our camper is quite large, so when backing it into a campsite at night in the dark, it is a challenge. I wanted a powerful spotlight so my wife could stand there and guide it.2 million candles sounded like a lot... but really... not so much. I am left still needing something to really illuminate the area! Sure, it is painfully bright when shone directly in your eyes, but I need a wider beam area.I guess I'll have to resort to my original plan, and mount white 12v ""driving lights"" on my back bumper (with a switch)."
2,Great light but only for a few months,This is a great light with many features but the battery is worthless after about 4-months. I wish they had a better battery and a smart charger.
2,2 million candle power?,For a 2 million candle power light I think my key light is brighter. Not impressed at all
1,Not worth your money,"I got this free through Amazon when ordering some other items. I'm not sure it was worth it. The battery lasts about 5-10min before needing rechage. On the plus side, it is very bright."
5,Voices Of Latin Rock Review - By Roc Barbanica,"The book release party last night at Bimbo's 365 in San Francisco was nothing short of amazing- The house was packed with stars and music lovers from every culture. The book was the center piece and deservedly so. It is PACKED with story, photos, I mean a TON of photos that teleport you back to the early days in the Mission and such giving the viewer a real sense of having been there. Props to Jim and Ron- and to Dr. Bernie Gonzalez- Proceeds from the book are supporting the Alex Speaks,Awareness for Autism Foundation- A video shown at the release party about the foundation can be viewed at http://www.RockVideos.US along with clips of performances from that memorable night in the City.- Rocky-"
5,just as advertised,"Glad to be able to get this sturdy folder that holds papers flat in portrait mode. (The office supply stores don't seem to carry them anymore.) The color is more brown than red, but that was not enough of a problem for me to take away a star.."
3,Oxo is not 18/10,This replaces my worn metal basting spoon. This spoon is so much better. I broke it in by using it to stir 2 lbs of bread dough and it surpassed my expectations. The large size and sturdiness made stirring the flour and liquid into dough incredibly easy. I noticed the lack of discomfort due to the soft padding on the underside of the upper handle. I'm glad I bought this. I gulped at the large size when I pulled it out of the carton but now I'm perfectly satisfied with this item.
5,"Large, well constructed, spoon","When my very old larger cooking spoons needed replacement, I chose this spoon and a slotted one like it. At first they both seemed too big, but now I use this spoon daily and the slotted one frequently.It took me a few uses to adjust to the ""largeness"", the excellent balance, and the convenient handle shape.Perhaps it is useful to note my opinion of use: the spoon size is ideal for a six quart pan, great for a four quart pan, OK for a two quart pan, but awkward for a one quart pan."
2,Delivered not as advertised,"The seller sent pants with the basic green camo pattern, not the timber pattern that is advertised, which is what I wanted. Since I have to pay shipping to return these, which is nearly half the price of the pants, it's not worth it."
5,Great Idea,"This is a great product - great idea. If you wash your vehicles the old fashioned way (with a 5 gallon bucket, soap and a rag) the way I do, then this is a product you'll want! It definately keeps the rags, mitts, etc. cleaner in the bucket, by allowing the grime and grit to sink to the bottom. Glad I purchased this."
3,From The Mind Of Bob,NO! They DO NOT fit your standard 5 gallon bucket that is sold at the big box stores. Just because they go inside does not mean they fit as they were designed to. They stop 4 inches from the bottom of the largest 5 gal bucket at Lowes. We all believe they will be resting on the bottom of the bucket when we buy these Grit Guards.I cut off 1 outer ring and filed down the sharp plastic edges and now mine fit to the bottom of my 5 Gal buckets. They are 10.5 inches as advertised...so if you don't want to trim these to make them fit..make sure your bucket at the bottom is a little bigger than 10.5 inches.
5,Excellent Tool,"This product is simple, effective, and durable - what more can you ask for? This is an awesome product and I'd highly recommend it."
5,grit guard,These grit guards really work. I start doing a 2 bucket wash using 2 grit guards and you can tell the difference from not having any scratches or swirl marks in the paint.
4,Does the trick,Fits in one of the Sam's Club laundry detergent buckets. The bucket is from a few years ago but the insert fits like it was made for it. The insert is sturdy plastic and should last a while with reasonable care.
3,"As described, but didn't fit the two new buckets I purchased.","I purchased these as well as two new buckets from our local Farm and Fleet. Unfortunately, these Grit Guards wouldn't go to the bottom, as others have stated, it stops about 4-5"" from the bottom. Since many others are having the fit issue, I would be curious where people are buying their buckets that do fit...would like to get a couple"
5,An simple/ingenious device that will save your paint job!,"Most swirls and micro-marring you see on cars is done when a mitt picks up dirt and you continue washing unknowingly. This is a good step to preventing that! For a few bucks you could save yourself hundreds in polishing and buffing out those darn swirls. This sits at the bottom of your bucket and gives you a good surface to wipe the mitt against and let the dirt fall to the bottom where your mitt won't pick it back up! I still run my hand through the mitt before and after I dunk it in the water, as clean of a bucket you can keep - the better. Definitely a must-have for anyone who washes their car!"
2,"great first day, hate it after!!","have had to wean my 5 cats off fast food dry food & thought this would be a good start, but... not so much. they loved it the first day & have snubbed it since. so much so that i bought a bag of friskies to mix it with so they will eat it til it's gone. hate the thought of throwing money out the dumpster so they're picking thru it & eating but can really tell they're not happy!!! won't buy it again. will try harvest moon ingigo gold & see how that goes. finicky cats for sure!!! but they love their mashed spuds hehe."
1,"Great idea, but does not work for me","This is a great idea, and I support it as far as I can. Unfortunately, 4 of my cats would not touch it after a few initial bites, and the fifth got all of the food and gained a lot of weight. I quickly switched back to science diet-pricy but they all love it and it gives me a fighting chance at keeping their weight down. I do hope most other cats like this."
1,My cats hate it!,"I have three persians who all love to eat, so after reading all the good reviews here and elsewhere I bought a 18lb bag. All my cats hated it! They would sniff it a bit and walk away! I'm going back to feeding them Solid Gold Indigo Moon Holistic Cat Food, cost a little more but at least my cats like it."
1,Bad cat food made my cat very sick,"They changed the ingredients and shape of the cat food. My cat began sick after eating the new food. It threw up almost everyday for one week. First we thought it is hairball, then we realize it was the new cat food caused him sick. Nerve buy these food for my cat again!!!"
3,great ingredients. cat wouldn't eat.,fantastic ingredients. wish my cat would've eaten it. my dog didn't care for the dog food either. and he's not picky. Cat food is shaped into dark brown X & the dog food is round & flat (similiar to iams dog food).
3,"Cat now can't stop licking, biting, scratching his own body?","I thought this food was good because my cat's picky digestive system seemed to tolerate it pretty well. This was until the puking started and the obsessive grooming. Now he has open sores all over his body from biting his own skin. After some research, there seems to be a bunch of cats who have had skin allergies erupt after being on this food for a while.Edit: It was probably not fair to have given this food a 2 star review initially. Why? Because the ingredient list seems to be good and it was probably my cat who was just allergic to this food. I do find it odd however, that many cats seem to get sick from this food after some time on it. It makes me wonder if there is some ingredient that is being used in excess."
3,Mixed results,"The ingredients appear to be pretty solid and our cat seems to eat it with no problem, but she regurgitates about once every week or two, and her bowel movements also do not always look ideal. She has also put on a small amount of weight since the switch, but that may or may not be related. This food is all she eats (aside from a daily Nu Cat multivitamin). These results combined with the other recent reviews claiming the formula for this food has changed in the recent past concerns me a bit, so we may be switching to Natural Balance Ultra Premium for our next bag. In other words, we can't condemn it, but there may be better options on the market. Petfoodratings[dot]net is a great resource for information.Update 11/4/12: We did switch to NB Ultra Premium and all issues have gone away."
5,My cats are happy which makes me happy.......,"After doing much research and settling on this cat food in an attempt to give my cats the most quality without breaking me too much financially, I am, so far, satisfied. All 4 of my cats love this food. Not much difference in their coats being healthier or litter box smells as other reviews mention but they haven't had any problems and this cat food gives me peace of mind that they are getting more of what they actually need in their diet than just junk. I order this product on a regular basis and will continue to do so until something changes where it is no longer beneficial to do so."
3,Food Allergy,"Did a lot of research online to find a reasonably priced quality cat food. Most supermarket brands and pet shops carry food with lots of grains, which is not good for pets. Peek at the ingredients and you will probable see corn or corn by-product high on the list. This food got several high ratings. I unfortunately bought the large bag without first testing it on my 2 cats. One cat did fine, but the other cat developed watery stools and rash around perineum 3-4 weeks after switching over. Loose stools and rash continued another week before I switched to a different food and they both cleared up shortly. Too bad, this is a good quality food at a reasonable price. I'm feeding them California Natural dry food with good results."
5,Awesome cat food!,I've had cats all my life and let me tell you this is one of (if not the best) the best cat foods out there. The ingredients are superb and all three of our cats love it. It's hard to find cat food that isn't made with by-product these days and I'm glad I finally found one I like.
5,Cat in Love with Food,My cat will eat nothing else. Makes his coat shinny and thick and beautiful. He never gets tired of eating this wonderful food.
1,Formula changed,"Just recieved my order. The kibble is now flat dots, not X's. The formula/ingredients is very different. Now Chicken, chicken meal, cracked barley, chicken fat, turkey meal, white rice, potatoies, oatmeal, millet, natural chicken flavor, salmon, turkey, duck, ocean fish meal, flaxseed, sodium bisulgate egg product..................I called the phone number on the bag and only got a recording to ""leave a message"". This is bait and switch.My cats looked at it and walked away."
1,Not working for us anymore,"My cat has been eating this brand for about a year with no issues. Ever since they changed the kibble shape, my cat has been vomiting after his meals. I'm guessing they must have changed more than just the kibble shape because something is not agreeing with him. I have been trying to figure out what else could be the issue. He is very healthy and I see no other changes in him. He is still his very energetic self which makes me think no health issues are to blame. I've changed his food and so for no vomiting."
5,.,It arrived very auickly with regular post. The condition was alot better than I thought it would be.I was pleasantly surprised.
3,Little Housse on the Prairie Season 7,I loved watching this season however the voices were not in sync with the lip movements.
2,quantity over quality,"I agree that the quality is below average. I have watched the first three disks so far and the second one is really bad. In fact in one episode the voices don't coincide with the movement of their mouths! Felt like I was watching something from a thousand years ago! This show deserves better even season 7 which definitely isn't as good! But ironically, my favorite episode is in this season and that is the first one when Laura gets married."
2,POOR EDITING,"My daughter and I love the series, but it seems that with each passing season the quality gets worse. Season 7 is the worst by far, and this trend started in Season 6. One minute you are in an intense scene, then you have missed a major portion of what has led us to another scenario. The voices seem out of sync with the characters apeaking.We will of course purchase the remainder of the seasons just to complete what we have started, but the negative reviews of the quality I can now no longer disagree with. It would be nice to see who authorized the editing of these series. There is no excuse for film from just 30 years ago to be so poorly edited when using state-of-the-art technology from today."
5,Review of this DVD,"This product was very good, nothing wrong with it, it is the 7th of 7 i have bought from Amazon, i am now buying my 8th one."
2,LHOTP takes a nose dive beginning this season,"When Season 7 originally aired I'm sure everyone was looking forward to a lot of fun and romantic episodes featuring Laura and her new husband Almanzo. Except for the episode ""Divorce, Walnut Grove Style"" and when Laura announces she is pregnant, the series took a serious nose dive this season and NEVER recovered. What was Michael Landon thinking with the 2 part episode ""Sylvia"" which involved child rape!!! It is a scary and violent episode that is NOT AT ALL appropriate for children. Then we get introduced to stupid James and Cassandra whom absolutely ruined the series with their terrible acting and even dumber story lines which always seemed to involve them running away from something. Season 7&8 NOT WORTH BUYING!"
2,not bad but...,"it was a nice series but throughout the series Mr. Ingalls is almost always the hero of the movie. as in the episode, the angry heart. he is the one who saves the boy again. the whole season revolves around mr. Ingalls. as for the sylvia episode, i was appalled at some of the contents. they should have warned people that it was PG-13. especially the part where the guy in black strangles her. it was horrid"
1,O.o,"i dont really like this series now that i know that they copied some of the episodes of the waltons. M.L.(aka. charles ingalls) even took some of the titles as the odyssey, the gift and so on. M.L is almost always the star of this series. after LHOTP ended, he created his own series called highway to heaven. this time he is the real ""star"" of the series. if you really want an original, good for family series, choose the waltons. the waltons doesnt have any PG-13 episodes. in this LHOTP season,the WORST episode was sylvia prt 1-2. it was a bad episode. if there was a lower rating for this series, i would lower it to -1000 stars. and one thing that really disturbs me again, is M.L's overdramatic role, he is so emotional. the way he cries and his voice breaks, its so ear wrenching. and then, they say ""Oh my G--!!"" so many times including saying ""G--!!!"" its so full of blasphemy that i am sorry that i even tried to collect the series. terrible series O.O"
5,Kids LOVE having their very own mini golf course!!,"Purchased this last spring and our 3 year old and 5 year old still haven't tired of it. They LOVE setting up the course different ways and making up rules for new games. When we have playdates this is always a favorite- even with kids up to age 6 and 7. For the price, this is a great value. If your kids love mini golf, they will love this. Only drawback is it has only 2 clubs and 2 balls- but for $5 at your local discount store you can get an extra set of clubs and balls (usually 4 clubs and 4 balls) in the no-brand variety that will work in a pinch, when you have company over. We give it a huge 4 thumbs up from our family of 4."
3,Not fun for older kids.,"When I read the reviews on this item, it seemed that kids up to age 5 and 6 would enjoy this. I bought it for my 4 year old. It holds no interest for him at all. And of course the same goes for my 6yr old. Basically, you just knock the ball down the short track and it stops about 3 feet away in a ""hole"". There are no obstacles per se (the ones that attatch to the track do not hinder the ball) I guess I should have looked harder at the product description. I can see a 2yr old liking this, maybe 3. My son DOES enjoy pretending the club is a sword, so that's something."
4,fun fun fun,I gave this as a big brother/big sister gift when their third baby came along and the kids are loving it.....
5,"You'll have so much fun with this...........oh yeah, and the kids too!","This golf course was very easy to assemble. It snaps together like a big puzzle. My only complaint is, they should make the golf clubs adjustable so that the parents could play as well. Lol! We love playing with this golf course. I wish they made this when I was a child."
3,Fun toy,"Bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas. He loves playing it. It's put together well. The only issue I have is that once you have played it a bunch of times, it's not very challanging. It is good to use for practice though as it has helped my son have better form when he plays real mini golf"
3,"Politically important, if flawed, documentary","Strong, if sometimes heavy handed documentary about Castro's horrificmistreatment of gay Cubans.Always interesting, but somehow not as powerful as it might be. Maybebecause it's too sure of it's own POV. There's no pretense of balanceor questioning of the claims made by victims. While I have no doubt oftheir honesty, it doesn't feel like the film is interested in doing research orproving it's points with more than talking heads recounting stories..Also, its focus seems to drift at times, into more generic, generalCastro bashing, which is less effective, and starts to undermine thepower of the specific arguments being made here.It's one thing to hate a political figure, even with good cause, andanother to really do justice to that hatred with solid film-making.And yet, all that said, I'd still urge people to see the film, becauseit does address an important and under explored issue."
1,this is not Cornerstone,"Please note that this is not Cornerstone, the danish band, from ex-Royal Hunt bass player Steen morgensen and fronted by ex-Rainbow Doogie White. Please do not put it with Cornerstone the band."
3,HISS HISS,CAUTION This is an ADD disk. The artistry is wonderful ***BUT**** Purchase it only if you don't mind listening to a guitar concert with lot of steam radiators hard at work in the background (;-).I bought a Sergovia AAD disk (Volume 1 of the Sergovia collection) with a small fraction of the background noise.
4,a wonderful and diverse album,"This is a great debut album which shows Olu Dara's diversity of style and talent but is still easy to listen to. The sweetness of the melancholy sound of ""Harlem Country Girl"" is a nice balance to the swing of ""Your Lips"". But if you are looking for something from when Dara played with Henry ThreadGill, this is definitely not that sound. But it's a great album anyway - Recommended."
4,like father like son,"Im fairly young, so I grew up listening to Nas(olu Dara's son). But, out of curiosity, I bought Olu Dara's album. It was really great. I loved the mood or each song. My favorite song of course is the collaboration with Olu Dara and his son. Listening to this album I see where Nas got all of his musical skills from."
4,excellent,"Sometimes the music gods give you presents. Olu Dara is one of those.Olu Dara had played with avant gaurd jazzmen like David Murry, but his solo material is another story. He makes a New Orleans blues that you would have to like only Supercuts music to not understand.His arrangements are pretty spare--you would think the whole band is playing without amps, though they are. But the blues and soul lines here are so clear, so well cut and crafted, this music comes off incredibly real--as if you just walked to a Big Easy street corner and started digging on these guys. Listen to the fantastic shuffle of ""Your Lips,"" or the understated trumpet of ""Harlem Country Girl.""Olu Dara has a rare gift: making music sound polish perfect AND spontainious. It sounds so REAL, but is so well played, you can tell this guy is an amazing musical talentGET THIS."
1,Are we that gullible?,"How did I fall for this? I bought the DVD and CD and enjoy them both, but felt that I'd been had about two seconds after opening this ""book"". This is nothing more than superficial garbage, designed to entice Dylan fans into spending yet more money. The apotheosis of cynical Dylan marketing, a product whose content consists ENTIRELY of packaging. Quite an achievement, that. I'm ""bringing it all back home"" alright--straight to the store where I got it."
4,Bob Dylan Scrapbook,The book arrived in perfect condition. I was surprised it came from the UK. That explains why I had to wait several weeks for it to arrive and free shipping was not available.
5,Bob Dylan Scrapbook,"This is just plain fun, fun, fun. As in been there done that by a genius of song. Better than the everyready battery bunny for lasting and multiplying and reproducing and keeping us hopping to the tunes of our lives. Can you believe this mortal man's career on planet earth and just imagine what heaven has in store? Go BOB go. This book is a little tiny corner of great big house. I gave one away as a present to a Dylan nut like myself and kept one for me. What can one say about greatness...can I just breath the same air as you...seen his shows three times. Enufff already."
2,Not worth spending your money on this unit,"I purchased this DVR at Frys Electronic in August 2005. It worked just a little over a year, then just died.The PC application design is not user friendly. The user manual is poorly written. For some reason it is not possible to go to a specific date and time to review a recording... the feature while present in the software, didn't work. This defeats the purpose of 24x7 recording of motion triggered events.Overall the DVR 4-Net seemed to be an un-finished product, Swann needs to work out the kinks.Also I wished the product allowed the user to upgrade it's software. You are basically stuck with the software that was flashed during manufacture (not an issue if it worked properly).I would not recommend purchasing this device."
5,so funny I read it twice,"I don't know if it's because I feel like a single mom or if just anyone with children or wanting to have children would appreciate it but this book was hilarious. It reminded me of reading Anne Lemott only more dry and painful. At times I was embarrassed that I was laughing and grateful that no one was in the room so I wouldn't have to explain what was so funny, because part of me was sure it was wrong to be laughing. Any way this was a great read!"
5,Pink Passion!!!!!!!!!!,This little pink 7-quart cooler is perfect for individual usage. I love the size and color. It has the standard insulation ability as any other cooler of the same maker.
3,Pleasant but uninspired.,"These performances of the most famous Strauss waltzes are reasonably well done by a competant orchestra, although they seem to drag somewhat. The sound quality appears to be substantially degraded by the digital remastering. Why this had to be done on standard orchestral selections is not clear. It also was not mentioned in the specifications of the recordings."
5,Unexpectedly enchanting,"I bought this album on a whim, and for the first few listens I found it very difficult. On the one hand, it verged on exhilaration, on the other Williams' voice sounds almost broken. But then that broken, little-girl voice grows on you..."
2,handle too long,I was looking for solid stainless steel cooking utensils that would be easy to handle. I went with the OXO because I thought it was good quality. It is heavy duty but I find it harder to handle because the handle is too long. I prefer the overall appearance to be smaller. I also don't care for the black grip on the back. I keep my utensils on the stove and I have had some of my plastic utensils melt when I am cooking in the oven. I have hung these on the wall and the black rubber back hasn't melted yet. I didn't realize in the description that these came with a back rubber black otherwise I wouldn't have bought them.
4,HUGE,This product is HUGE. I had to send it back. It's much larger than most utensils of this type and much too large for comfortable use with my pans. I gave it four stars because it's perfect if you are looking for larger than normal utensils. It's well designed and the handle is very comfortable to grip.
4,Excellent recording,This is a very good set of recordings of the late string quartets.My one BIG criticism is that the last movement of Op.127 is carried over on a separate CD-that is unacceptable in my mind and totally unnecessary.
2,Well Played but Poorly Packaged and Dry,"They really do a nice job here. However, the layout of the disks, not presenting the works in order and splitting OP. 127 down the middle over 2 disks is poor. Also, the sound quality is a bit dry, as if the instruments were miked very closely. Finally, I would recommend the Lindsay renditions on ASV as really unleashing the emotional power of these great works. Once you hear that, these performances seem lacking in intensity."
3,Still looking for a great version,"So far, I have listened to two versions of this. This one, and one by the Busche Quartet, and I must say that I prefer the latter one even though it was recorded in the 1930's and it's recording quality suffers. According to the Penguin Classical CD guide the Busche version is a classic.The Guaneri version did not draw me into the music, I tended to just drift off and the music just played in the background. At least with the Busche version it did make me sit up and listen, at least in parts.I'm still looking though. I will try one by the Italian Quartet next."
4,"Usually good, but canceled order","I order this regularly from time to time to use as my regular multi-vitamn. While it works great when mixed with G2 gatorade powder, my last order was inexplicably canceled after a week had passed. No reason was given!!!Be aware that this may happen to you, too."
4,Wonderful & Moving,"Loving in spite of everything, dealing with death (the final invading barbarian) without fully understanding it. There's a lot in this film and it all hangs together. Excellent acting. Harkens back to 'Decline of the American Empire' (same director, some of the same cast, 17 years later). I bought it, and I'm sure I will watch it many times."
5,Awesome,"I have had the CD for ""That Lucky Old Sun"" ever since it came out and the music has really grown on me. I think, considering his life and his personal difficulties, that its amazing Brian continues to write such fantastic music. So I purchased this DVD and was pleasantly surprised by the live performance and mostly the Documentary and behind-the-scenes footage of Brian and his band in the studio.If you're a fan of Brian and/or the ""That Lucky Old Sun"" album, this is definitely worth the money."
3,Expected More,I have all Suzanne's book and I was so excited to order this one and I was a little disappointed as far as how much I spent. It is average in quality oh well I still love all her other ones. Maybe if you find this one for less money than it is worth it.
5,A gripping saga of struggle and the search for meaning,"Fire Of God is the debut volume of a planed five-part series by author J. M. Kelly that is a dark allegory set in a distant future. A war with origins in the distant past threatens the balance of good and evil, and terrible events come to enwrap the planet Augusta. One of Augusta's KaRel family is bequeathed the most powerful weapon imagineable: the Fire of God. But power this great is almost beyond mortal comprehension, and could potentially hold the key to the galaxy's demise, as surely as its salvation. A gripping saga of struggle and the search for meaning, and the threat of all-consuming internecine conflict, highly recommended."
2,Needs work,You probably shouldn't spend your money on this unless you are a firm believer in the book of revelations. And the prose is poorly done.
1,Pretentious and dull,There are much better books on wine to read and study than this pretentious and deadly dull book. The book is written poorly and makes an interesting subject dull and boring.
5,Simply Excellant,"This book is one of the most complete problem solving books I have read and more importantly the most simple. Easily read in an evening, when done, you can only ask yourself, ""why didn't I think of that"".It is not like the millions of standard, complicated, and redundant, ""you must be driven, go-go-go, yeah, rah, rah"" motivational books on the shelves.Al Horner applies simple tasks and check lists used for ""life survival"" in the Navy Seals to business. If you understand the military, this is unselfish, your life depends on the guy next to you and his life on yours.In the end the book deals with balance of family and burnout.Pound for pound one of the best I have read and I will be impementing Mr. Horner's ideas well into the future."
5,Sets the Standard,"I don't know how Chris Tomlin keeps doing it. This album is one that sets the standard for modern worship music. You've probably heard almost half this album already in worship services everywhere. ""Not to Us"" is one of my all-time favorite songs, powerful, rockin', and shades of U2. ""Come Home Running"" is a beautiful, thoughtful song that is the opposite in tempo but an equal in quality. I'm astonished by the variety of songs on this album and it has to be one of my all-time favorites of this genre. You can't go wrong."
4,"Chris Tomlin ""Not to Us"" Review","This is one of the first albums from Chris Tomlin I bought after first hearing him at a youth conference. (He was the worship leader) ""Not to Us"" is a follow up to his ""The Noise We Make"" album.I really enjoyed this album and the songs ""Enough"", ""Not to Us"", and ""Famous One"".Chris Tomlin is an artist who continually creates music for the glory of God and that is reflected in this album."
5,Wonderful Music,"Chris Tomlin is a very gifted musician and this album is no exception to his ability. I LOVE LOVE LOVE about half the tracks and really like the rest. Thus it gets played often both at work and on my I-Pod I goto a church that sings somewhat ""progressive"" music during worship and we do four tracks off this album regularly - Famous One, Come Let Us Worship, Enough, and Wonderful Maker. It's a great CD to just through into the stereo or your car, crank, and praise God to. If you are a Tomlin fan, this is a must-buy. If you are simply a lover of great praise and worship, this is a must-buy too. Better yet, get an extra one for your neighbor and watch him get saved!"
5,5 Stars and Beyond....Another gift from God!,"This is the second cd I purchased on Chris and it's fabulous.I travel over a large mountain to go to and from work.So during one of my trips home I had my favorite radio station on which is KLOVE and I heard Chris's song on this cd called ""ENOUGH"" That's all I had to hear.I stopped the car on top of a large hill and just simply gazed up at the over powering stars and cried.I was totally awestruck.The song just filled me with God's awesomeness and love.The entire cd was definately God inpsired.Chris is one of my favorite Christian singers and I recommend this cd to EVERYONE!All Chris's songs are an eleborate way of epxressing his love and faith in the Lord.His music is beautiful.Very easy to hear the words and to remember them as well.The sound of the guitars are gorgeous. Keep them coming Chris....you are one fabulous artist!"
3,Bottle Popper is very cool...when it works.,"I was really excited to give this Popper for a gift. The first use was flawless. I was happy, but my daughter now tells me that it is hit and miss getting a successful removal of bottle cap. Disappointed."
1,Junk,"Total junk, do not buy, barely works....had one from years ago that held up better, but still that one broke too."
1,LAME,This thing is lame... Does not work well... and is not cool. Save your money. I bought this for my boyfriend and he hated it.
3,A small sound for great masterpieces,"This CD is a good deal by its nice price and a historical character. But the sound quality is far behind the artistic level. For exemple, there's no compare with two other reference recordings of ""1812 Overture Solonelle"", made +/- 10 years before this one! - Antal Dorati's (Mercury Living Presence) and Alexander Gibson's (Chesky Records). That's the perfect sound for a classical recordings, not this made by RCA ... sad but true.Buy this CD for a great Ormandy & PO, for Tchaikovsky's immortal works, but don't expected a hi-fi sound (not even a very good sound). My stereo components - CREEK EVO CD player & AMP, HGP Dona Loudspeakers, In-Akustik Black&White; reference cables."
3,Not the one you want,"The version of the 1812 Overture on this disk is not the famous one with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the The Valley Forge Military Academy Regimental Band and real cannon, but a version recorded with the Temple University Choir and electronic cannon. If you want the former, look for the CD packaged with Symphony No. 4 and Marche Slave."
5,Highly Recommend,"First of all, I think it is very funny that everyone gave this book a great review except the two readers from Los Angeles, where this book is set! Maybe it hits too close to home for Angelenos who (I have found) overestimate their cultural and intellectual significance. As well as being completely full of themselves.I read this book long before I came out to Los Angeles, and would like to read it again now that I have been here a few years. Back in a rural area of the East Coast, I thought it was a hilarious book that I could not put down. It is one of those books you are disappointed to have end. Sadly, some (a lot) of the book is true of the Hollywood scene.Ok, so it's not some grand philosophical treatise, but it is a very witty and sharp view of Hollywood. I have read other Felske books, and they do not compare to clever writing of this book."
4,This One Switched Gears on Me!,"A fascinating tale. The first three-fourths of the book was a humorous story involving a struggling Hollywood writer, his unusual ""mentoring"" relationship with a ""playboy wanna-be"" Hollywood mogul, and the various types of beautiful ladies that populate their world. However, the last part of the book evolved into some serious, page-turning drama. ""Word"" was quite a read!"
2,Too Hip For Its Own Good,"This book thinks it's oh-so-clever, filled with so many ""unique"" references to Hollywood in- and outsiders and wannabes. In essence, not much happens in it. It's about a screenwriter trying to make it in Hollywood, yet every time something writing-related happens, the narrator tells us he's not going to dwell on that because it's boring. Instead, we must endure countless scenes of him doing what becomes his primary job: pimping for a successful studio executive by throwing his unsuspecting female friends at him. Nice guy, this screenwriter. Though he ""redeems"" himself in the end -- in a twist befitting a mystery novel, which this is not -- it's basically a ""who cares"" moment by then."
3,Good review of a unsung hero,"Ok, Ed Asner Hams this up a bit but it's still a good summary of the little known Thomas Garrett, arguably the greatest Underground Railroad Conductor in U.S. history."
2,This guy doesn't know anything,"First third of the book provides unfounded, fallacious and misleading theories, subsequent two thirds is boring production details like what was shot on which day and obvious production details like the cast and what not."
3,Some Interesting Views Even if from a Bit of an Ego Trip,"The book is an interesting, quick read, although marred by Dr. Groopman's being pretty stuck on himself. Still, Dr. Groopman underscores some problems in health care delivery that demand immediate correction. The best of the book already appeared in the New Yorker; if you read the two chapters published there, the rest of the book adds very little."
4,A Physician Inspired by his Patients,"This book is a thought-provoking journey into the core of what constitutes the practice of medicine and the meaning of the practice of medicine to a physician.The chapters deal with Dr. Groopman's personal experiences as a doctor. He documents the struggles, empathy and learning that develop between him and his patients. He describes how his viewing his patients as more than just a diagnosis helps to increase the rapport between patient and doctor.Though not as ground-breaking as his previous book, 'The Measure of Our Days', Groopman continues to write with insight, self-reflection and with a vision widened by the people he treats. He documents how the privilege of healing, along with the patients he comes to know, contribute to his own growth as a physician and as a man."
1,Second Thoughts,"As a family doctor, I know how important communication and intuition can be in patient care, and was looking forward to learning how another clinician uses these ""soft"" tools. Instead I found an apparently infallible ivory-tower subspecialist second guessing other physicians. Misleading title, disappointing read. Try ""Kitchen Table Wisdom"" by Rachel Remen instead."
2,More of the same,"With so many mass market books for layment written by medical doctors, it really is necessary to choose between those who are merely writing about their own practices and they problems they encounter (whether medically, morally or ethically) and those who are also wonderful writers, who use their own experiences to paint a broader picture of the human condition. I find Groopman very much in the former category (good doctor, mediocre writer) and people like Sachs and Nuland in the latter. Also, there is an elitism in Groopman's tales that is off-putting."
5,Harman/Kardon king of the road!,"I was the harman/kardon authorized dealer in kuwait until last year (1999), And nothing really goes wrong with harman. I,m using some equipment for my homeTheater such as thx receiver - 5 cd changer - casset. deck and also a power thx amp.And a AC-3 decoder. Still they'r running great after about 3 years , with no problem at all. Even in worst ventilation condition like using them non-stop for 24 hrs. I did test the set and it's great comparing it with phillips the double cd one . The dobbing was as the original cd . I know what is harman i,m sure that this one will be great also . last word for harman : thanks man you realy made our live easier and more fun by using your equipment."
4,"It is almost perfect, but..","The Harmon Kardon CDR2 lives up to its reputation in terms of music quality. I also found it easy to set up and could easily record off both CD as well as audio cassettes. For those who have a large analog collection that they wish to digitize (as I do) I suggest that you buy one blank CD-RW disc also. You can then assemble a selection on this CD-RW and then zap it on to a (less expensive) CD-R disc. The CD-RW allows you to correct your mistakes (which are likely to happen when you are transcribing cassettes). The two features that I would like to see (but missing) are 1) multiple CD capability on the play side (if you are making a personal collection, the chances are you will be recording from several CDs), and 2)An option to finalize automatically. The other disappointment was that you could not use the 4x speed feature when recording a selection of tracks. If these annoyances dont bother you, I would highly recommend this deck. My rating would be 4 1/2 stars."
3,"beautiful sound, but........","This device plays & records cds BEAUTIFULLY! The sound that this machine makes when a cd is played is incredible However I was disheartened with a couple of features. First, the only way you can record a single track from a cd is through the remote controller. If you should by any chance LOSE the remote, you're outta luck! Second, every time you stop recording, the recorder automatically puts a 3-4 sec. space at the end of your song. For me, that can be really annoying. If you're not as anal as I am about recording specifics, then this is a wonderful cd recorder for you. The cds are recorded superbly & the sound is great!"
2,The repeating point,another version of Tubular bells - get the original.DVD is only a cheap computer made video (i can make it myself) and few album tracks to listen in DVD rom.
3,Not a Great Value,"At a running time of a mere 107 minutes, this CArtoon Network set of Halloween/horror themed cartoons isn't a great value quite frankly. With no extras $10 - $15 seems somewhat pricey to me. $7.99 would be more fair,Anyway you get nine toons from Cartoon Network regulars The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, Ed, Edd 'n Eddy, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Cow & Chicken, I A.M. Weasel, Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, and Johnny Bravo."
2,Not very Halloween-ish,"Not a very good offering for a Halloween-themed DVD. The only ones even remotely Halloween related are Billy & Mandy and The Powerpuff Girls. All the rest seem like a random assortment of older Cartoon Network originals. You can't really call the Courage episodes ""Halloween Specials"", since EVERY episode of Courage deals with monsters, ghosts and other creepy happenings. At least the Nickelodeon Halloween DVD had ONLY the Halloween specials. Get a clue CN, or Warner, or whoever picked out the content for this disc."
4,Great for kids,"This was bought as a nostalgia type gift. It is a mix of cartoons, but overall it is a neat little collection of Cartoon Network Toons."
5,CARTOON NETWORK FAN,"IF YOU LIKE THE CARTOONS ON CARTOON NETWORK, THEN YOU WILL ENJOY THE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SHOWS FROM IT ON THIS DVD."
5,"Kubert's ""Yossel"" Is A Moving Work Of Art","Yossel is a young Jewish artist living a decent life in Poland with his family, until a horrendous event will forever change his life. This incredible book follows the story of an innocent Jews trying to survive the horrors of the Holocaust; from the terrible conditions of the Warsaw Ghetto to the inhumane and atrocious environment of the work camps.The story is narrated by Yossel, and the captions are very moving; but the phenomenal illustrations is where the story really shines. Kubert opted to use only pencils to tell this story and the result is magnificent. The rough sketches help to establish a dour, dark tone and really add to the level of realism.""Yossel"" is highly recomended for people with an interest in WWII or the Holocaust, fans of movies such as ""The Pianist"", or anyone looking for a powerful, moving work of art."
1,Ugh *Awful Face* Spitting out over the sink rinsing my mouth,"I love other Larabar products (and have them in my cabinet currently). This one however shouldn't have ever made it through their testers. It's so horrible that even 1 1/2 years after trying it, the thought of it causes my face to automatically squinsh up in digust. I cannot express fully in words the utter awfulness of this product. However, the telling of the story of both my mother and I leaning over separate sinks spitting it out and rinsing our mouths is sure to set both of us off in hysterics to the bemusement of anyone around us. I wholeheartedly DO NOT recommend trying this product. (Ugh. I need to go rinse my mouth with mouthwash just from thinking about this product long enough to write this review.)"
1,Yuck!,"This was the first Larabar product that I tried, and it was awful! The bar smelled and tasted like Vicks Vaporub, which is not exactly a pleasant thing when you're talking about food. I will definitely not be purchasing any of their other products after this awful experience."
2,Tasteless...,"I absolutely love Larabars...Decided to try Jocalat. Thought the mint flavored ones would taste the best. Was wrong. But then again I am a complete chocoholic. Trying to cut out my sugar-filled treats, maybe I just took too big of a jump. For now I will stick to the Larabars."
2,not fresh,"I usually enjoy this product but the box I received from amazon was not fresh, so tasted more dry than usual. The date on box expires soon, so I can tell this is an old box/batch of bars. Very disappointed."
1,I normally Love Larabars but the jocalat was gross.,"I normally love Larabars. I have tried a few favors and have loved them all but there is something really off about the Jocalat bar. They were dried out and when you tried to take a bit out of the bar it crumbed. The box said they were good until Jan 2012 but they tasted old, dried out, just plan gross. I am not sure if this a bad box or if larabar company needs to redo their bar flavor.Bad product!!!"
5,These are AWESOME.,"Insanely delicious. Texture and taste are phenomenal, they are incredibly satisfying (and don't leave you feeling mildly nauseous like actual junk food) and the ingredients are just marvelous. Mmmm mmm."
5,Great Chocolate Bar,"One of the best I've had. It doesn't have any unnecessarily added fats. The ingredients are 100% natural, the sweetening is 100% natural, and the taste is 100% delicious. If you love your chocolate with a hint of bitter taste (dark or bittersweet), you'll probably find this bar delicious."
4,Earns a 4.5 star rating,"The LaraBar Chocolate snack is really quite tasty. The texture is good, and it has plenty of nuts. A filling treat, it is also thick and chewy, just like a brownie should be. It is a little shy on chocolate taste, though. If it had the chocolate zing of a PureBarPure Bar Chocolate Brownie Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12), then it would be the best of the best. I recommend this healthy snack for anyone who is looking for a healthy gluten-free alternative to a brownie. YUM."
2,It tasted like alchohol,Two stars because i t was my least favorite larabar. I was surprised all I got was a boozy flavor of peppermint extract. I make peppermint brownies with peppermint extract too. But this bar was not that great. Too strong. I do have a sensitive palate though.
3,Very minty,"I love Larabars and I bought a box of these when they were on sale and I didn't like these as much. They are a little too minty for me. The funny thing is that I bought a box of these because I had bought one from the health food store and I loved it. It was very delicious to me then but six months later I guess my taste buds had changed. The flavors I do really like are cherry, apple, lemon, and chocolate coconut."
2,Great idea...but I got tired of eating them,"Loved these both in taste and concept when I bought a few from EMS. Bought three cases (variety packs including, cashew, apple pie, this flavor, others) to leave at work and around to snack on, given lack of concentrated sugar, etc. Even though I never ate more than one a day, got a little sick of them and now can't eat them anymore. Kudos :-)= to the folks that make these, but hard to 'live on.'Larabar Bars Variety Pack Of Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, And Pecan Pie, 1.6-Ounce Bars (Pack of 18)Larabar Bars Variety Pack Of Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, And Chocolate Coconut Chew, 1.6-Ounce Bars (Pack of 18)"
1,"If you like the smell of feet and the taste of chalk, this bar's for you","I like to try all different health food bars and when I saw one that combined my two favorite things together (chocolate and hazelnuts) I said, ""oooh I have to try"". I was sorely disappointed. I bought two of these and I was excited to try one. I opened it and was hit by the awful smell of... well a foot-like scent. So that was a turnoff, but I said hey I have never been one to let looks or smell hinder me from trying something new. So I went ahead and ate it. I had to force myself to finish it. It was like torture eating this. It tasted awful. I actually opened up the second and dared a coworker to try it because it was so bad. He tried it and he felt the same way. It has almost no flavor, but what flavor it does have lingers in your mouth and grosses you out.Who I'd recommend it to: 1.) People that like to give friends that lose bets something awful to eat. 2.) My enemies."
1,"Looks good, feels like chewing a cardboard box","It tastes neither like a chocolate nor coffee. I'm not sure about the health benefit but it's a torture to chew this thing. I enjoy many other healthy food but this one's a totally no no.It's as if they just mixed cacao and coffee bean then put tons of sugar to cover the bitterness of the two. Too sweet, but not tasty sweet.I won't buy this even if it's free."
2,Larabar Jocolat Bar,"I have always enjoyed this product, but unfortunately, the boxes that I received from Amazon in April,though the expiration date was November,2011,were dry, seemed stale and were inedible. Very disppointing."
2,not outdated but not quite right,"I cannot get these Jocalat bars in my local store and I have ordered them from Amazon several times previously. In my last two orders the product, while not outdated, tasted stale. It tasted as if the box had not been stored properly and perhaps had been inadvertently frozen."
2,Not A Fan,I thought this would have tasted better... I have a whole box left now and will probably not eat them. I much prefer the LARABAR Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip. I found this this one was very dry and not very sweet.
3,Tasty snack for when you are in a hurry!,This a great snack for when you are on the go or for when you want a treat! I just wish the chocolate was a little more prominent!
2,Good option for the overly health-conscious,"Sure, there are no added sugars, but the dates that overpower the flavor are the first ingredient, comprising 21g of sugars/bar, certainly no innocent snack, and with no real flavor in the original flavor. The hazelnuts are lost in that variety, too; had such high expectations and these just fell flat."
1,Not one I would buy again,"Don't know if the box of Jocalat bars I got was just not fresh or what but they were awful. Loved the Cherry and Apple Pie, Pecan was ok but these were like a dry brick."
1,Larabar Jocalat Chocolate Hazelnut bars,"If you are a fan of Larabars like I am stick with the fruit bars. They are delicious. I ordered these without trying them and was very disappointed. They are dry and not the least bit sweet. You do have to realize that you are not eating a candy bar, and that there is only 3-4 ingredients in most Larabars. This works for the fruit flavors but not for this particular Larabar. I would not order them again."
2,Not good,"These did not taste good to me. They were almost chalky and did not have a good flavor. The mint tasted strange. I'm disappointed since I enjoy other flavors of Larabars. I would pass on these and get the cashew cookie, or apple pie if you want something sweet and that tastes great.Edit : This review is for the chocolate mint flavor obviously"
1,Chocolate Mint,"Goes beyond a ""peppermint"" taste. It honestly tastes like hard liquor, although with none of the corresponding euphoric effects. Would not recommend."
5,Price was right,Received this Bulova ladies watch in time for a birthday gift. Saw this item in Macy's for a higher price. Thanks for the good service. And great price!
5,Love it!!,"Out of all my watches I love this one the most. The picture does not do it justice. I get compliments on it a lot. Anyway I have had it for almost a year and I am still in love with it. I would really like to buy another one just in case Bulova stops making this model, but I am saving up for an ESQ.It is hard to tell in the picture but the face is subtle mother-of-pearl. The diamonds really sparkle in the light."
3,Nice for small wrists,The watch looks nice generally but take note that the strap is thin and the face is quite small. Appropriate for those with small wrists.
1,Written for 9th graders,"First five chapters are on Dell's configurator ""Choice board"". This one is a total waste of time. Not technical, not re-invent the business. What is the audience here?"
3,IN ANY GOLDRUSH ...HAVE A GOOD LIE DOWN FIRST,"In any gold rush, only the shovel makers end up rich. Slywotzky is no shovel maker.I do not want to be too negative, but all his books are the same formula - one brilliant idea that comes out in the initial 40 pages then another 300 to justify the cost. Sounds like mots consultants' reports.I would suggest that you get someone to copy pages 1 to 40 for you before you decide to buy this book, then have a good lie down before proceeding. The focus on the customer is encouraging but totally impractical in implementation.If you buy it, be ready to start hearing the same themes over and over again."
5,A Wonderful Historical Romance Full of Wit and Comedy.,"I loved this book. The heroine, Mary, is a genuinely amusing, strong-minded woman who deserves to find true love and acceptance. She meets her match in Alex, a Marquis who is determined to not follow in his lecherous father's footsteps. And yet, he's very tempted to seduce Mary, who he has hired to be his daughter's nurse. The plot takes many fun, unexpected turns and you can tell Pamela Britton really did her research. She also has a great ear for dialogue. If you love historical romances, this is one to try, even if you fear you've read the same plot over and over again. Britton writes very well and knows how to set up and engaging story."
5,Croaking Mouse(pad)...lol,Purchased this for a dear friend who is totally into frogs. Well made and very colorful.
5,Doing the Right Thing,"This movie is a wonderful tribute to a man who did the right thing in his heart - went and stood before powerful men to abolish slavery - the story behind the hymn, ""Amazing Grace."""
4,Amazing Grace - one story,In an era that was dominated by English racism Wilberforce has the faith and tenacity to bring about the end of the slave trade. The movie title indicates his inspiration by referring to the beloved hymn written at that time. This is a drama you won't want to miss. One story of how God chooses to work through us in the world.
4,Inspirational,"This movie depicts an important piece of church history and is very well scripted and cast. It gets a little long, but is well worth hanging in there for the bag pipe performance of the song at the end."
2,awful,"This movie was full of obscenities, smoking, during the first 10-12 minutes; I turned it off and threw it in the garbage. I would not say that this is a ""Christian"" movie, as advertised. It is about a Christian man--but too much of Hollywood for me.If you want Christian movies--The Kendrix brothers productions: Flywheel, Facing the Giants, Fireproof, Courageous etc. are excellent."
1,Not the correct item in case,"I cannot review this correctly. When we opened the ""New"" dvd case, that was wrapped like a new movie. ""Garfield"" the movie was in its place. Very dissapointed because this was a gift. The place that I purchased it from ""did not"" have any more in stock. They said they would refund the money, but I will have to wait until my next month statement to make 100 percent sure they did."
2,"Love the sound track, hate the movie","Save your money. I had heard the sound track for the movie, liked it alot, and decided to buy the movie. That was a mistake. Not only are few of the songs on the sound track in the movie, but the movie was disjointed, slow moving, and, well, dreadful."
5,Passion for Justice,Moral conscience and passion for justice are perhaps the central themes of Amazing Grace. It is a well done film. Educate yourself and others by sharing this film...Enjoy watching this movie full of 'grace'--both content and cinematography-wise.
5,The story of abolitionist Wilberforce and how the hymn came to be written,"Lovely movie full of wonderful actors, including Albert Finney and Michael Gambon. Don't know why it is not better known. Without being at all tiresome it tells the story of the years-long struggle of William Wilberforce (1759-1833)to abolish the slave trade in England and all of its colonies. Along the way it explains how the lovely hymn, Amazing Grace, came to be written. Wilberforce is wonderfully played by Ioan Gruffudd who manages the trick of portraying a stunningly good and moral man with huge passion and sex appeal."
5,GREAT INSIGHTFUL MOVIE,MUST SEE MOVIE IF YOU LIKE HISTORY AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW ONE PERSON CAN MAKE A CHANGE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD.
3,"GOOD MOVIE, BUT....","While Amazing Grace is a good movie, I wasn't as impressed as I hoped I would be. I much preferred Amistad. One of the reasons might be because I only watched it once but some movies, such as Amistad, take only one viewing to really leave an impression. For me, I think one of the things that disappointed me was the lack of African-American actors and also, not enough was spent on the terrible aspects of the slave trade. I don't mean by that to say, horror filled scenes of the slave trade in action should have been shown except for maybe an example or two to give the audience somewhat of a feel for how horrible it really was. I know the movie was about William Wilberforce and his efforts to abolish the slave trade and, therefore, the story focused on him and rightly so. I just think a bit more of the African experience should have been shown as it would have re-inforced the good Wilberforce was trying to do. I loved the ending performance of ""Amazing Grace""."
5,"amazing grace ""proudly South-African""","Amazing Grace was made by Hansie Cronje's brother, creative studio's that made the bio about Angus Buchan- Faith like potatoes. I enjoyed Amazing grace and will never listen to the song without thinking about the life of William Wilberforce."
5,inspiring,Wilberforce was great man. His deep hatred for slavery strikes a chord within men as very similar to how I feel about the horror of abortion. Wilberforce's horror over slavery is only matched by his love for God. Its touching to see how he draws close to God and finally gives in to Him in the early part of the film. I have bought more than 1/2 a dozen of these dvd's as gifts
5,AMAZING GRACE,This was an amazing book. I saw it on tv or Netflix and decided to buy for my school teacher son as it was so informative re uk feelings about Slavery. I did not know most of this info and thought it worth sharing. great story. l.hoover
5,Worth watching,"This is an excellent film about how one person can indeed make a difference in the world. William Wilberforce believed God wanted to use him to abolish slavery in England...and though it cost him personal health and acclaim, he persevered for over 15 years. A good supplement to the history account that some kids study in high school. I highly recommend it."
5,Amazing story,A must see movie. It is inspirational. You will not be disappointed. This is a story of courage and conviction. We simply do not have these type of leaders in the world today. We still have the people who argue that our economy cannot afford to do the right thing.
5,Great Movie,Very motivational and well directed. Acting is fantastic but the plot really drives the movie to another level.
5,Amazing Grace,"Must read, and must see. I really really recommend this book and DVD for those who are in pursuit of reforming our political and governmental systems to make better society. Two words come to my mind: Justice and Freedom. Especially, this book and DVD are highly recommendable to all Christians because William Wiberforce followed what Jesus did for us by saving us from our sins. What Jesus did for Righteousness & Salvation is comparable to what the actor did for Justice & Freedom. Amazing grace ~~~~~"
3,Amazing Grace,"Good video for all ages. If someone is wanting to know the true story behind this movie, I would recommend research as the video is not all fact."
5,inspirational must see,"I rarely write reviews, but this movie really moved me. I am not certain how historically accurate this movie is, but it inspired me to research the issue and the people involved. It was not as cinematically stunning as most period pieces, but that would only have distracted from the story. This movie is a must see for everyone from every walk of life."
5,Amazing True Story!,"I love this entire film, which shows the long struggle of this weak man (physically), with a strong conviction and determined will to abolish slavery in England, whose minister and mentor was the man who wrote the hymn Amazing Grace."
5,Love it,I love this movie not just what the movie is abouit History about a man but the strong Christian believe in it I wont spoil it for you but if you love amazing grace you will love this movie. fast delivery good price.
3,Good production but the story was a little lose,"I purchased several movies with this one but the others were not major productions. However, I must say of the 4 I liked this one the least. It didn't develope the characters and story line as well as the low budget ones did. It was just okay for me, not wonderful."
2,"Great subject, poor film","I would love to see a good movie on this subject.Unfortunately, this one was badly written and badly acted."
2,Disappointed by Transparancy,"Too obvious... Just from a film point of view. Certainly not a ""Schindler's List"". I watched it the way thru since I paid for it. I hope I am not painted with negative liberal tones. I have seen too many liberal witch hunts. This is a pure criticism of the film not the theme, message, plot line .....But, honestly I almost could nont wait until an Alien burst from his torso."
1,not the correct item,"I read the features of the film: It says French, English and Spanish subtitles. That is why I bought it. But it did not. Very disappointed!!"
4,Good story of bravery and perseverance,"A poignant reminder for today's world of the horrors of the global slave trade of centuries past and the bravery of those who dared to stand against the trade no matter the consequences. The acting is superb on all accounts. The story - whether it's historically correct or has been subjected to artistic license - is still inspirational as Britain's William Wilberforce stood as the leader of the abolitionist movement and against all odds of success at a time when slavery was the lifeblood of the economy. My only mild criticism is that the movie dragged a little through some parts and could probably have been shortened just a tad. Nevertheless, it's a good one."
5,Wonderfully entertaining.,"After seeing the previews of this movie on television, I ran - didn't walk - to the movie theater and was not disappointed. Now I eagerly await the DVD release and will add it to my collection, after watching it again, of course. Ioan Grufford (if only I could pronounce his name correctly) is a fine actor and really captured the spirit of William Wilberforce. A good movie for the classroom. It stays with you."
5,Amazing Grace DVD,"Amazing Grace is a stunning movie. The actors and actresses chosen for this movie were perfect for their parts. The history and the historical facts for this movie are timeless. This movie is perfect for all age groups. However, children under 13 should watch it with their parents/guardians. If you want to know the true facts of the grisly business of the slave trade (which unfortunately continues today) without the ""gore"" this is the movie for you. Anyone that wants to continue William Wilberforce's legacy should definitely see this DVD. The last scene in the movie will take your breath away. I feel privileged to have seen this movie."
2,Amazing Grace,"This is a powerful movie based on a true story. It is eye-opening and poignant dealing with the Britsh slave trade. Great acting, a very redemptive drama."
3,Good historical drama,"The movie was not that entertaining to watch, and it suffers from a lack of drama, in the sense that the viewer obviously, knows how the movie will generally end. The effect of the movie is that it does not reveal any fundamental truths about mankind, or the behavior of man-it feels like a documentary made for high school children. I find that the best stories have a historical situation in the background and a human drama in the foreground. This movie stumbles a bit with that balance, but the acting is quite good, and it might be worth a look."
4,Fitting Accolade,"Naturally the film romanticises the original story of this great unselfish man, William Wilberforce, who fought so hard and tirelessly for the abolition of the slave trade. But what a wonderfully fitting accolade for such a great man. It's the feeling, the spirit of the man that really was captured in this piece. I have been to Wilberforce's home, now a museum, many times and felt the same spirit- brave and determined- there, as I felt when watching the film.Go Wilber!"
4,Solid,Good movie of substance. It was very inspiring. We liked it. We recommend it to others. Good message. Good story.
3,Didn't live up to the hype,"Based on the raves of a number of my friends, I expected to love this film. It was okay, quite well done, but it wasn't my taste."
4,Slavery,This man had a goal and gave everything and nearly his life to stop slavery. Highly recommend as a bit of British history.
5,Think big,"This film is an inspiring account of the stuggle of William Wilberforce and his contribution to elevating society. His tireless efforts to end the slave trade are realistically portrayed in an intensely dramatic few hours. It is good story for young people, especially in demonstrating that doing what is right is not easy and not popular, but you can change hearts with persistence. In the film, William Pitt says that Wilberforce never wavers, is never swayed from his purpose. The film has compelled me to ask: Can anyone say that about me?"
5,Great Historical Film,If you want to learn a little bit more about the political history of the abolition of the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade I would recommend watching this Hollywood accurate historical film.
4,Good But a bit miss leading,By the trailer for this movie I thought that it was the story of how Amazing Grace came about. All and all it was a good movie and I would recommend it to others. A 4 out of 5 rating
4,excellent for those interested in the Sociology/history of sport,excellent for those interested in the Sociology/history of sport.intelligently written but not light reading.
1,too little too late,"Where to begin? First of all, this book is a century out of date. Americans do not play baseball in great numbers anymore hence the low TV ratings for the World Series (actually lowest ever in 2006). Also, look at the ""international"" aspect of MLB now--Japanese, Koreans, Chinese (via Taiwan) as well as the usual Latin Americans who are now greater in number.A more relevant comparison would be football (as in the NFL and college) and soccer. Anyway, more Americans play soccer than, say, the nation of Britain, if we are talking sheer numbers. It's just it's a recreational sport and always will be because soccer is flat-out too slow, low scoring and has too much diving in it.Personally, although the writing is there, the research isn't with this book. A far superior book that understands soccer and North American sports is: Offside by Markovitz and Hellerman. Buy that off amazon here not this misguided piece of junk."
2,It did not come with a transducer for the fishfinder,"It did not come with a transducer for the fishfinder. That fact was NOT in the information; I found out when I received it. Other than that, great product. Works as advertised. Other sellers include the transducer; read the ad carefully!"
1,Pet Shop Boys + Broadway Don't Mix,"I have loved virtually everything the Pet Shop Boys have done and can't say enough good things about them. That much said I can find nothing redeeming for their cover of Sondheim's ""Somewhere"". This isn't the first time PSBs have delved into the realm of Broadway...who can forget their screeching shuddering version of ""Losing My Mind"". They were best off leaving that for Liza on her superior version on the ""Results"" CD. But no, the PSBs can't leave well enough alone and have to make another go at Broadway. Their version doesn't add anything to the Broadway mileau and frankly Striesand's cover version is superior. It's only worth it for completists (like myself...although why I'm not sure) or obsessives (myself again). It's only worth one star and that's only for the other tracks on the single. To quote the PSBs ""That's my Impression""...I don't dare leave me email address for fear of flaming responses for die-hard PSB fans."
3,it's mostly a little too breezy...,"and you can't but think this aint really the very best of little beaver, just the stuff they had the rights to. they be talkin about great tunes like ""i love the way you love"" in the booklet, but they aint nowhere to be found on the cd. Generallt theres ust a lil too much breezy jazz guitar and light disco going on. I bought this cause I love ' i can dig it baby', but there aint many others on here that stand up to it... richie1250"
5,Great product works as advertised!,"Just as stated, this cable was a perfect fit for both of my LG VX8500 phones. The correct drivers were included with the item and it installed without a hitch on Windows XP Professional.Although the software that is included didn't seem to work with my phones (as was stated in the description), BitPim (www.bitpim.org) saw the phones and allowed me to move pictures and ringtones to and from the phones with no problems."
3,Go for the Bluetooth Adapter Instead,"There's nothing particularly wrong with this cable. It transfers data just fine at a decent rate provided that your operating system supports it. However, you'd be very hard pressed to find drivers that work in 64-bit operating systems.This cable also works as a power adapter.As an alternative to people who do run a 64-bit operating system, spend about $30 on a simple USB bluetooth adapter. Modern Windows OSes have built-in bluetooth drivers or you can easily find them on the manufacturer website. I believe Toshiba makes a bluetooth driver that works for many devices even if they are not Toshiba. With the Bluetooth adapter, you can use an open source program called BitPim (available on sourceforge) to transfer all of your ringtones and contacts and what not. You don't need specific drivers for your particular phone."
4,Good Start to His Career,"Bonegrinder is one of the earliest novels published by John Lutz. It was published in 1977 according to FantasticFiction. It was a good read and an interesting take on the beginning of his career. His characters are always fully developed and the suspense he generates is palpable. He has come a long way in his career. His Quinn novels are incredible and I look forward, as always to Lutz's next adventure."
4,Good read!,"This was edgy reading, I had trouble putting it down. Easy to visualize the location and the events. I always like an unexpected ending."
1,Not Good Reading,I did not like this book since it seemed so disjointed. It was uneven in parts and the ending was almost as if the author had to finish it up in a hurry. Left lots of things unsaid and unfinished.
3,Just okay,"I liked the way this book started out and it did keep my interest. Sadly, I was rather disappointed at the end. I don't know exactly what I expected but it was not the ending of this book...maybe something a little different and I would have given it a higher rating."
4,Surprise ending,"This was an interesting book. I am not crazy about sifi books and all the time you are reading this book, that is what you are thinking. But!!!! It is a pretty good book, you have to read it."
3,Bonegrinder,"A bit simplistic, but I did read it through to the end. Could have been more character development. Fairly predictable."
4,Bonegrinder review,"Good book right off the bat, grabs & keeps your attention! I thought the whole story was quite good, but disappointed in the ending."
2,Bone grinder,"This book captured my interest quickly. But it went downhill all too soon. The characters were never fully developed leaving the reader in limbo. There are too many loose ends. Relationships are left hanging. The problem, for me, was that there was never a thread to join the characters. The end was left hanging with a question mark. The general plot was all too murky without people to engage with. I do not think this was a good read."
3,"I read ""Bonegrinder""","Agonizingly slow with many plot twists that lead nowhere, and led to an unsatisfying conclusion. A fairly good ""escapist"" read, but wouldn't recommend it for entertainment on a trip."
3,bonegrinder,the book keeps you on the edge from the start wondering what is killing people and not being found in the lake and once it is killed in the end it makes sence.
5,Urge to Kill-John Lutz,This is a very good book. It held my interest and kept me in suspence. I really like John Lutz books.
1,Rambling to the World Cup,"Not much of a CD; a hanfull of songs in all. This seems to be a rush job to take advantage of Ireland's qualifying for the World Cup, with a couple of tunes urging on the ""Boys in Green"" to do their best. The Ramblers have some great albums out, but this sure is not one of them."
4,Why why why!,"This game is awful, but I found myself playing it for hours! Why why why! You do ""work"" (capping pens, sorting chickens, making pots, wrestling) for a paycheck. Then you take that paycheck to get useless figurines or new ""games"" as in new ""work."" The work is usually quite grueling, but for some reason I still continued to play for hours! When I made my first $50, I put it into the $50 vending machine and got....a figurine. But did that deter me from continuing to play? No!Some of the games are really hard like ""Run Like Hell."" But there's something terribly motivational about working really hard and trying to win new games to try out. I feel a little sad that I will cap 1000 pens just for $20. But I figure, if I've played it for hours, I obviously was having fun, right?"
3,WTF Indeed,"It's horrible! The graphics are so ugly they're hard to look at. The games are mind-numbing. It's symbolic of life - working at a job you don't enjoy just to get a meager paycheck.But, as other reviewers have said, it's strangely addicting and hard to put down. If you're looking to kill time, this'll do it. But since that's kind of the point of most video games, you could probably get a prettier, more enjoyable game for the same price."
4,Perfect game for the PSP,"This is a fun collection of about 40 bizarre mini games. You start with only a few games that you play to earn money which you can spend in vending machines to receive trinkets, tools, and more games.Most of the games the novelty wears off after playing a few times, however there are several games that are fun and addicting.I find myself playing WTF when I have 10-15 minutes to kill."
2,Good game..?,"Good game but not good enough. didn't know this game was for the UMD because i got it from playstation network (Playstation Store) and WOW.. It's worth it for the PlayStation Store Price but for amazon's or any other price... wow, [...]. Is really fun if you have a friend to play with.I am like the KING of GAME reviews and this game just doesn't do it for me.."
3,"A snazzy, lovingly over-orchestrated pop record!","Many have criticized this older EBTG record in light of the duo's new ""Walking Wounded"" drum n' bass sound, which I also love. But ""Baby the Stars Shine Bright"" remains a great EBTG record. It may be overly-produced for 90's ""unplugged tastes"" or for fans who loved the jazzy, sparse art house sound of their first two albums. But for fans of the group's music and lead singer Tracey Thorn's voice, it offers moments of musical brilliance with swirls of Burt Bacharach, swashes of Hollywood musicals and even a dollop of Tammy Wynette and Patsy Cline on songs like ""Don't Let the Teardrops Rust Your Shining Heart"" and ""Baby Come Home"". Tracey's voice is powerful, elegant and heartbreaking on tracks like ""Sugar Finney"" and ""Don't Leave Me Behind"". The CD is a huge pop production with great lyrics and haunting melodies."
3,Charming Piece Of Work,"Although I don't feel that this is EBTG's best work it is still a nice listen. My favorite song on this CD is by far ""Cross My Heart"" because Tracey Thorn's voice is impeccable and very rich on this song. The other songs are carried by the instrumentality which compliments Tracey's voice so well. Even though I gave it only three stars,(because EBTG's other CDs are more superior)I would still recommend it to this group's fans if not for any other reason than to have a complete collection of this talented band's works."
1,Prior to this CD I big fan....,"I bought this CD because it was not only ""cheap"" but I had already purchased several EBTG CD's and I always thought that they were GREAT!Until now...Avoid this CD! Run, hide, knock down small children and the elderly during your escape if you have to but avoid this CD at all costs!"
3,beautiful but limited sizing,"I love my Debbie Bliss books. But I was slightly disappointed in this one because the sweaters were generally sized for mostly only one (a few had two) size only (some of her later books size for various sizes ranging from 0-12 months, or 1 - 5 etc.). So, if I liked a design, but the baby I was knitting for was not the exact size the pattern was fitted for, I was out of luck. There was no variation and I am not experienced enough of a knitter to adjust the pattern This was very frustrating, because some of the sweaters are quite cute."
4,Very cute patterns inside!,"Young children's knits are wonderful. They are adorable and, because of their size, quick to knit! This book is a treasury of such patterns, and I have found the directions easy to follow and complete. There is a pattern for an infant one-piece with a small intersia bunny, matching bunny booties (adorable!), and a matching bunny stuffed animal! Bliss also has a pattern for a little bo-peep sweater with the famous girl and sheep in the sweater pattern. If you don't like having to change colors to make pictures (intersia), you'll still find good patterns: an ""abc"" sweater and blanket that shows the letters through texture, some very cute hats and sweaters, and stuffed animals."
2,Too loud!!!,"This alarm clock is pretty annoying. There is no volume adjustment so it just has one setting....LOUD!!! The voice recording is fuzzy at best. You can barely understand what you have recorded. The idea of recording your own voice or your child's voice is great...but the quality is awful. I would not recommend this alarm clock. In fact, I'm returning it!"
2,Most Important Part Of Clock Doesn't Work Well......,"It's too bad because this clock is cute, durable and easy to use.This is for kids, so I didn't expect the recording to be crystal clear...but the sound is really fuzzy. I would not recommend this alarm clock, we were really disappointed with it."
1,horrible quality,"I wasn't expecting top of the line, but the recording quality is terrible. The beeping on my current alarm sounds more like my voice than what was recorded on this thing! Do not buy it!"
1,Wild Planet Your Voice Alarm Clock,Was very dissapointed with the quality of the recording this alarm offers. It would only record 3-4 seconds at a time. The audio was so garbled and unclear you could hardly understand if it all. This was a poor choice for a gift. Would not recomend.
1,Good idea poorly executed,"I feel for the little girl who the product purports ""invented"" this alarm clock. It is a good idea terribly executed. The message can only be three seconds - nothing!, offers no volume control - loud!, and the sound quality makes the message unintelligible. My son and I got this as an early Christmas present for our soldier headed overseas in the hopes that he could wake up to our love and sound of our voice each morning. Instead he is going off w/o anything since I don't have time to get a replacement product before he goes. I regret not reading the reviews when I purchased...could have saved myself and my son our disappointment. The manufacture should be ashamed."
5,Why buy a TV?,"The goal of this purchase was to separate out my sons gaming consoles - one has a PS2, the other had a game cube (shown). The unit comes with a vga passthrough cable that allows the computer to ""Pass Through"" without the unit even being on. (neat trick) It can allow TV input - although we like to filter that source a little bit more, as parents.From initial delivery to perfect run, took me approximately 20 minutes - because I did not fully understand the audio portion. Please check the instructions when you open the box - it has a neat (albeit small) DIAGRAM on one of the inside pages."
2,Easy to Install But Low in Picture Quality,"The price is very reasonable and it's easy to install. Configuring the settings was a bit tricky at first but definitely doable. However the quality of the picture on my monitor (with 1650x1050 resolution) was really low. I also bought this TV tuner to use my monitor as a bedroom TV. However, even though the tuner comes with a remote control to turn it off when you're done watching TV, you still have to get up to turn off the monitor. So in combination with your monitor, it really doesn't work as a bedroom TV. I decided to return it."
1,Not Reliable,"I had it one year ago. Because it is cheap, I do not expect too much to this product. It worked fine when I got it although the signals are not very good. (I connected it with a 22"" LCD monitor.) Then, I stopped using it for about 6 months. While the next time I used it, it has no sound at all. I do not have ideas when it goes bad. What I am sure is that it is broken within a year. It is not a reliable product."
2,Good luck...,"So far have not had luck with this product. First one had bad sound, second one the video flashed on and off. I'm going to order one more, and if that doesn't work I'm done. From other reviews, I was clear going in this was a mediocre product, but if it worked I'd be happy. So far, no go."
3,LCD TV Tuner Box,"This product does perform as good as the specs say it does, but you have to have very good connections for your cable or strong signal to get the best visual quality out of the tuner box, but all in all I am satisfied with it FOR NOW!!!!"
5,"Mush On and Smile: Klondike Kate, Queen of the Yukon","Wonderful job of compiling information for this piece of historical fiction! Having heard so much about the Alaskan gold rush and Klondike Kate, I was most interested in reading this version. It made for great reading; especially with the author's slant of Kate reflecting back years later. It truly made it hard to determine fact from fiction. A time stopper in literature! This book was also reviewed by the Tacoma Koffee Singles."
3,so-so result,still having trouble getting the glue to remain on the paper after the protective sheet is peeled off. most of the glue stays on the peel-off sheet.
1,Hazardous,"This product is hazardous. The way how it is supposed to be attached to the factory pedals is not secure at all and if you have to press the brakes hard it becomes loose and even falls off. Would not recommended at all. Gear knob is the only nice thing about it, the rest is worthless. I will return it.Pilot Motorsports PM-261 Satin Finish Manual Transmission Combo Kit"
1,WARNING ! Wait For A Second Release !!!,"The vinyl album, New York Rock & Roll Ensembles' first album, is excellent. The CD on Collectables label has various speed fulctuations or ""speed slips"". You are much better off waiting for another company to re-release this on CD."
4,thank you,"This was one of my favorite 'personal' albums 35 years ago-one that very few knew about, but meant the world to me.I , like the previous reviewer, have always been moved by 'She's Gone', and 'You Know just What it's Like', and I find myself whistling 'Mr Tree' at odd moments.So-where's 'Faithful Friends and Following Foe'? That was thealbum that first turned me on to the NYRE, and cannot even be locted on e bay. I remember they did a version of 'Think We Better wait Till Tomorrow', that kicks butt."
2,Super aburrido/ Too boring,"It's just a story, it's not a game. All it does is read the words. Educational: yes, Boring: Yes. It does not keep my toddlers happy for more than 10 minutes. The one from Diego, totally fun and educational. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,Don't scroll down!,"There's an awful spoiler by one ""seangator"" that gives away the ending in these reviews, so be warned not to read them if you don't want the ending ruined. I emailed Amazon that they should pull it.Excellently realized history; my only problem is so many players, many with similar names.The clash of wills between Henry III and Simon is interesting throughout."
4,I have read this twice!,"I love all of Penman's books, with this one and The Sunne in Splendour being my favorites. I am facinated by the story of Simon deMonteforte, and learned much about his life and plight after her introduction in this novel. Ironically, the English Historical Society has done little to commemorate him today. I enjoyed learning about this time period through the eyes of so many characters who are not commemorated today, but who obviously had a large role in shaping the British Monarchy and popular culture's view of the past."
5,Hard to put down,"Just as good as Here Be Dragons. Ms Penman must spend hours and hours of research for her writing and it shows. The drama is as intense as ever and you'll find yourself getting deep into the lives of the wonderful characters. Read Here Be Dragons first if you can and get The Reckoning because you""ll want to read that too. Good read!"
5,Best in the Trilogy,"I LOVED this book. I read it very quickly and was engrossed. I never ever cry or continue to think about a particular part of a book like I did this one. The people who read probably know what I am talking about but I do not want to give anything away. The characters were brought about wonderfully, because you hate them and love them, you cheer them on and you want to hit them. Great book, would recommend to anyone who likes historical books without the feel of a textbook."
5,"Simon,where have you been?",This was the first of Penman's books I read and now I've read them all....twice!. Her exceptional style of writing and her ability to bring the Medievil era alive have made me a true believer. The fact that Simon De Montfort is not known to us all is suprising. I can not recommend this book and her others enough.
4,"Falls the Shadow, Sharon Kay Pennmen","This book continues the high standards set by Ms. Pennmen for historical novels. Fiction is woven with historical facts so expertly that the characters and their conflicts truly come alive. The only suggestion I would make is that Ms. Pennmen include a more detailed genealogy of the characters, possibly including more generations before and after the main characters. This would add another dimension for those readers who enjoy this type of detail. Otherwise, a most enjoyable book. I am just starting to read the final book of this trilogy, The Reckoning, and I expect to enjoy it just as much as Falls the Shadow."
4,Deep and Dense,"I loved Here Be Dragons, the first of this series of books because of its humanity. I admire this book deeply and often read it with some dread, knowing the ominous end that characters were going to come to. Its characters are both larger than life and sometimes less than human, and it is a very ""male"" book. (This is certainly not meant to be an insult.) I had not had much knowledge of Simon de Montfort prior to reaidng this, and I was very impressed with his story and how it connects up with the legend of Robin Hood and the stirrings of the political strength of the common man in England. I also, as several reviewers have noted, was horrified and moved by Penman's unflinching handling of anti-Semitism. She shows the struggle of genuinely good men dealing with the deep-seated cultural constructs of their times, and that is an important lesson for all of us."
3,Good product that can be more durable,"I bought this radar gun in the spring of 2009 and it lasted until the fall of the same year. I have no complaints on its accuracy or ease of use. It is a bit bulky and made from rather flimsy plastic, but it is supposed to be for those who are budget-conscious. I normally kept it in my camera bag to prevent large impact but, somehow, a wire came loose and disbled the radar. I tried calling the manufacturer to have it serviced but they never called back. I imagine that durability would not be an issue if the owner kept this stationary but I do not. I purchased the Pocket Radar this year and am very happy with its size and high build quality."
4,Illustrations the best part,"Convey the life in Europe a hundred years ago, colorful and make a good basis for talking with family members. Stories long and probably wouldn't hold interest for children."
3,Not Their Best Work,"While the single ""Out To Get Me"" is one of Clawfinger's most energetic and emotionally stirring songs, the album is overall not very memorable. It's full of cover versions of songs that were lame when they first came out, not terribly moving. ""Shine On You Crazy Star"" left me feeling unimpressed and asking, ""Why?"""
1,Not powerful enough = no fun,"My 4 yr old son loved the idea of this toy but it does not have enough power to suck up even the smallest bug. If we see a bug, I wind up having to scoop it into the vacuum. Not great for me & not fun for him. Save your money."
1,"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE, WILL NOT REFUND DAMAGED GOODS","I PURCHASED THIS ITEM AND PAID ADDITIONAL FOR INSURANCE. I RECEIVED THE POORLY PACKAGED GOODS DAMAGED, BUT THE SELLER REFUSES TO ISSUE A REFUND EVEN THOUGH I RETURNED THIS ITEM. STAY AWAY!"
5,great,Next to grease This is my all time favorite old story line with great modern moving music love it i would recommend to anyone
5,"The Assassination Bureau,LTD DVD- a classic","I watched this movie many years ago and liked it very much. I liked the blend of humor in what could have been a very dark movie. This movie is destined to be one to be used in the family film library, where we can choose what to watch at our convenience. It is a little sad that so many of the actors that made this film a success are gone, but Oliver Reed and Telly Savalas did ceate some memorable moments in this film. Thanks for keeping some of the oldies on hand."
3,"BASIL DEARDEN, OPUS 37","This movie is not a bomb, it's a movie about bombs and bombers. And it should pique your curiosity because The Assassination Bureau offers adventure moments (bombs and chases in London, Paris, Venice and Vienna), action scenes (zeppelin versus castle), comedy parts (disguises and inventive assassinations) and, at least, eroticism (Diana Rigg with Victorian underwears and the visit of a brothel in Paris). A very good surprise. Recommended."
4,A Great Movie - Little-Seen,"""The Assassination Bureau"" was an unfinished novel from the pen of Jack London. Another writer took London's outline and finished it and several years later it became this fun movie starring Oliver Reed, Diana Rigg, and Telly Savalas, released in 1969 by Paramount Pictures. The movie deviates a little from the book, but all-in-all, both are equally enjoyable. The British director, Basil Dearden, was one of the more interesting directors working in the UK from the late 40s through the late 60s. Many of his films were social dramas which dealt with taboo subjects like race (""Sapphire"") and homosexuality (""Victim"") way before they were acceptable topics. But he also made films in most of the genres out there. This one and his 1965 spy spoof, ""Masquerade,"" starring Cliff Robertson & Jack Hawkins, are light, breezy and just fun to watch. It is too bad the MGM/UA hasn't put that one out yet for home entertainment."
4,Exciting,"This is a good book. It had it all, a great story, good characters, wonderful action and a quick pace. This is just a good old exciting book. The author peppers the book with plot twists that keep the reader on his toes. This author writes in a way that is tight and slick that keep you interested through out. This is a solid murder mystery. Ok, so the detective that is used is straight from central casting, but that book is not bad. The story comes together and you believe it. I would have liked a bit more depth on the locations and characters, but not a bad read"
2,Not bad...,"First read this upon it's initial release when I was in high school and absolutely loved it. Horror, action, ancient mysteries, occult, plot twists- I couldn't put it down. Then I forgot about it. 12 years later I was recently going through some boxes at my mother's place and found an old, tattered paperback entitled 'Rune'. So what did I think after re-reading? Well... still lot's of fun but... the characters are, unfortunately, incredibly stereotypical. The two detectives on the case are older gentlemen and one of them is about to retire. Whoa, original. And the protagonist's girlfriend is so stereotypically, frigidly perfect that it is a wonder he sees anything in her at all. I'd have killed her myself. Anyway, still an engrossing read, but I certainly see flaws now that I didn't as a kid."
1,Avoid this dvd !!,"Researched this dvd. Despite the comment of the other reviewer, was led to believe that the Robert Altman documentary ""The James Dean Story"" WAS in fact, the full 80+ minute version.Received it today via Amazon who sent it to me on behalf of one of their sellers.1. ""As new"" was NOT how I received it. The dvd case was broken, the 2 dvds were SIGNIFICANTLY scratched/scuffed. NO liner notes. That alone merited it being returned to Amazon.2. More importantly (and this is why Amazon should remove it from their listings) - even though the dvd outer notes boast ""includes the full-length Robert Altman documentary"" - NOT !!! The version here is 40 minutes - the original was somewhere in the region of 80+ minutes.Thanks to the original reviewer who posted here - I should have heeded the warning."
5,Unnerving restraint,"This is perfection. The Tokyo quartet plays with very much sense of the architecture of the music. If you like your Beethoven played with restraint, refinement, sense of the interior drama of the music, this is it. The Tokyo quartet is never over-dramatizing, but let the music speak for itself.Compared to the Takacs quartet, I think the Tokyos are generally more elegant and balanced on the middle quartets, their tempos generally not slower, and they never exaggerate. The Takacs is more exciting though.If you plan to buy the opus 18 quartets, go for the Takacs quartet - more concentration and excitement.For the late quartets, nothing compares to the religious readings of the Tokyo quartet."
5,Excellent movie about adoption and its problems,"For those of us who were young people in 1950, this story about a family in California is very authentic in almost every detail. Jane Wyatt is perfect as the mother struggling with the pros and cons of revealing that her eldest daughter Gail is adopted, a rare situation in 1950 America. When the middle daughter finds out and reveals the adoption to her step-sister out of spite, a chain of events are unleashed that could have been disasterous were it not for the strong bond and love and devotion the parents inculcated in all three daughters. In the end, this movie demonstrates that adopted children thrive when the adopted parents consider the child 'their very own.' Superb movie in every respect and should be required viewing for adopted children and those considering being adoptive parents."
4,love her,This series is really a great books. I can't wait to read the last book. Not what I expected but was better then the gray books.
2,bland and boring,"Those that like Harvey's ""you go, girlfriend"" stylings will enjoy this book studded with empowered women and the pliant boy toys they employ to service them. The rest of us will giggle at the silly contrived plot devices and yawn at the predictability of it all. The characterisations are shallow and there is little growth or development to be had from this bunch of cardboard cutouts. Not quite as cookie-cutter formularised as a Harlequin romance, but just as ho-hum nonetheless."
3,Not as good a followup as could have been...,"I'm a huge fan of ""Butterfly"" so I was delighted to see this one come out. However, it didn't quite prove as satisfying as I'd hoped. I would like to have seen it bring back more of the characters from ""Butterfly."" The story isn't quite as satisfying as the original & the secondary characters are a bit silly. But, if Ms. Harvey ever decides to follow her main character a bit further in another book, I'm game! Despite the rating though, if you liked ""Butterfly"" you really have to read ""Stars."""
4,"After Butterfly, I needed more ....","While Butterfly was a tough act to follow, Stars does its best. granted it doesn't have the gripping plot twists that the first part of the story had but it's got plenty to keep your interest and appease your Beverly/Danny fix. You'll read about Phillippa and her early life in boarding school waiting for her adoptive father who has all but disappeared, and you'll struggle with her as she grows fat and earns the name ""Choppy."" And then she sheds the weight and sets out to find her twin sister. No fair reading ahead, but you'll be tempted. And do order both books. They haven't become outdated."
3,2/3 through,"A friend recommended Butterfly to me and though I had seen that it was a trilogy- I wasn't convinced it was, as the first book finished up so neatly. A prompt by amazon to purchase book 2 led me to purchase it- and was amazed with the new twists!In short- an interesting read-I enjoyed the first book- and am having a hard time putting down book 2. I will certainly purchase the third!"
3,Stephanie Plum Lite,"I call it Stephanie Plum Lite because like most lite products, this book leaves out most everything that makes Stephanie so entertaining. The characters and the plot are both so similar to Plum books, but without the zaniness and freshness that make them so hilarious. Hopefully after this first effort Sofie will find her own way, but this first effort pales in what is an obvious comparison."
2,"It's ok, wouldn't want to pay the HB price",This book wasn't bad but not great. The pacing was a little wonky and the review wondering about the plagiarism is pretty on target.
4,Not quite what other said.,"I read several reviews before purchasing this book. Otherscompared it to a Evanovich wannabe. I tried to keep an openmind and was pleasantly surprised. Yes, there are similarities,but there are enough differences to keep you entertained. Ilove to read, especially female detective/bounty hunter stories.I loved the humor. I love a book that makes me laugh outloudand this one did. I am a true Evanovich fan, but I am alsonow a fan of Tori Carrington. Give her an honest chance andyou will be pleasantly surprised. Will also be purchasingmore of her books when available."
3,It's Ok but not great,"I say it's just ok, but I did enjoy this little romp through greek land. I found it too much of a cross between Stephanie Plum (i am a huge fan) & A Big Fat Greek Wedding (ejoyed it tremendously) to call it a brilliant addition to my collection. I would read another installment, but if it continues to be such a same old same old story, I wouldn't go any further. At least Sofia is intelligent rather than a dim-wit stumbling through the story just getting lucky by falling on the most important clues needed to solve the case."
1,Stehanie Plum clone from My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"Where to start with the similarities? Stephanie caught her hubby with his pants down ""in flagrante"" on the kitchen table, Sofie caught her fiance in the church w/the maid of honor. Stephanie has a mysterious Cuban (?) hunk who shows up at odd moments, Sofie has a mysterious Australian hunk who shows up at odd moments. Stephanie has a wacky family featuring a short, wacky grandma, Sofie has a wacky family featuring a short, wacky grandpa. And on and on.Is it enjoyable? Only if you haven't read any of the Evanovich series and haven't seen the Wedding movie. Otherwise, you'll be wondering why no one has sued for plagarism."
1,A Big Fat Greek Disappointment,"I bought this book looking for lighthearted and entertaining escapism. What I got was not at all what I'd hoped for. I loved ""Greek Wedding"" and previous reviews had mentioned humor, so I figured it was worth a try. The Greek in this novel was heavy-handed and ""in your face"" and I was still looking for laughs on the last page. The characters were okay, I suppose, but one can only care about the creepy almost-husband and his infidelities for so long befoer the story of his misbehavior becomes tiresome. Sophie talked about herself more than she concerned herself with solving the mystery at hand, and she just wasn't interesting enough to maintain momentum of the novel for 280 pages. The only one laughing out loud here is the author. If you're looking for laughs, I suggest you try Sarah Strohmeyer's ""Bubbles Yablonsky"" series. She's a funny character with a fun story to tell."
2,At least she doesn't blow up the Mustang...,"...but otherwise Sophie is a Greek version of Stephanie Plum. The story line was interesting enough, but the writing style was ragged and inconsistent. I might read the next novel in this series...but only if I can find it at the library."
2,BLATANT Stephanie Plum rip-off,"As many other people have mentioned, the duplication of characters, relationships, actions, and situations are incredibly glaring. And it just gets more obvious with the second and third books in the series.If you like the Stephanie Plum series you might vaguely enjoy this as a weak filler while you wait for the next Evanovich novel. I, however just got distracted because the Plum parallels keep coming up to slap you and give you a sense of deja vu.These characters aren't very strong and neither is the plot. There are quite a few loose ends which I suppose are left dangling purposely so they can be woven into future books. Just for the heck of it I read up to the third book and they're still dangling.Read this if you need a quick fix while you wait for the next Stephanie Plum novel, but don't expect too much. The best thing about this book are the recipes in the back."
2,I like Stephanie better.,"At first when I read this book I thought that Janet Evanovich had written it under another name because it was a Greek version of Stephanie Plum. But as I continued reading, I found that the authors had not achieved the laugh-out-loud quality that is so prevalent in Ms. Evanovich's books. The characters were vague and poorly drawn; I didn't find any of them particularly likeable, not even Sophie Metropolis, who seemed like a whiner to me. Still, I probably would have enjoyed the book more if it hadn't seemed like such a rip-off of the Plum books.As another reviewer said, I will not pay to read the second book in the series."
3,Neither dazzeling nor brilliant...but an OK summer read,"I have to assume this is just the introduction of the many characters who will populate future Sophie novels. There were too many unanswered questions for there not to be future works. I mean, is there anyone not cheering her grandfather's attack on Thomas-the-Toad...or anxious to see how he clears himself of the assult charges? The Jake Porter character is worth many more volumes too. An OK little summer read."
1,Sofie Metropolis,I read about 20 pages and then tossed this book. Very contrived series of one liners. Would not buy any other books by Carrington.
3,I WAS AT THE CONCERT FROM 12NOON TILL 2-3 AM WHEN LEP CLOSED,I WAS AT THE CONCERT AND THIS CONCERT WAS FROM ABOUT 12 NOON TILLLED ZEP. CLOSED FOR ABOUT 1 1/2 HOUIRS AT 2-3 M.STAGE WAS SHAPED LIKE RECORD R LP FOR YOPUING PEOPLE. AS 1 BAND PLAYED STAGE WAS DIVIDED IN 3 PIE SLICES NEXT BAND SET UP AND LAST BAND TAKES APART .IT NEEDS 5 MORE CDS TO SHOW THE GOOD STUFF.
1,Garbage,"This book is garbage. 95% of the time while reading this book I was asking myself ""what does THIS have to do with negotiating?"" The book is basically a bunch of boring personal stories and bible thumping with tiny, generic, and usually useless pieces of negotiating ""advice"" every once in a while. (...). Fortunately there are many great negotiating books, but this certainly isn't one of them. Save your money."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I'm on page 89, and I'm going to STOP wasting my time. I got this book to learn how to negotiate, not to listen to preaching on the Bible and republican opinions. Frankly I'm offended by the author for making me read 89 pages of impractical drivel."
1,Not T-H-A-T Good,"The book is about 50% actual negotiating tactics and 50% political commentary. There were some interesting ideas insofar as negotiating strategies, but nothing really unique. The author comes across as a combination of an friendly, lovable uncle and the Jack Lemmon character in Glengarry Glen Ross. His political commentaries showed a breathtaking shallowness and lack of historical knowledge...such as his statement that the Western world's confrontation with the Islamic world began in 1979(?!). In the appendices, Cohen includes several memorandums to top officials in various administrations which provide insight to a neo-con understanding of the world. That such an underdeveloped grasp of geopolitics occupies a large portion of the book throughout is disappointing, and seems to influence Mr. Cohen's thoughts on negotiating."
5,"""NEGOTIATE THIS"" HITS THE BULLSEYE","Herb Cohen has given us an impressive book that is lively and readable. It's filled with realistic and amusing anecdotes that make his points come alive.Not only is this the best book ever written about negotiating but decades from now it will be regarded as a classic in psychology, sociology and the human condition. On the scale of 1 through 5, ""Negotiate This"" is a six."
1,"Irrelevant rumble, effort not worthy the mention","Compared to ""You Can Negotiate Anything"", there is nothing new here. While ""You Can Negotiate Anything"" is a very ordinary book itself (way overrated in my opinion) this is an absolute waste of time!Rich on ""anecdotes"" but short on substance. Lots of irrelevant rumble, too. This book will NOT teach you how to negotiate.Can you teach an old dog new tricks? No, judging by how much the author learned in two or so decades from the release of the first book. He simply uses his name as a brand so people will buy the second book hoping for a revelation or negotiating miracle that will transform them into good negotiators overnight. No miracles of any sort here - the only miracle is that people are buying this book in large numbers!I bough this book and, luckily, managed to sell it on e-bay straight away. You may not be so lucky! Stay away!"
3,Not What I Expected from this Master,"Okay. I know everyone so far has given this new book of Cohen's five stars. He is an excellent writer and great negotiator and I've enjoyed his previous books and gotten a lot from them. I found this one shallow and off-track. His previous book was much better and deeper.There was a lot in this book from his previous one. In fact, word for word. And that's okay. But there just wasn't enough new stuff to make this worth the investment.Susanna K. HutchesonOwner & Executive Copy DirectorPowerwriting.com LLC"
2,Simply not T-H-A-T good!,"Cohen uses some of his negotiating tricks in trying to get you to buy his book -- such as glowing testimonials from Donald Trump and Larry King, but once you actually buy the book and start reading it you discover that it is pretty much disorganized ramblings from one who lacks clarity, focus and coherence. If you want a good book on negotiating skills that are relevant and you can actually put into practice, try Gavin Kennedy's ""Everything is Negotiable.""Through lame biblical examples and ego-puffing stories of little relevance abound, the book does offer some valuable advice, but it is just too loosely organized and replete with ramblings designed, it would seem, simply to add page count."
5,BRILLIANT,"This book is one of the best books I have read. It is funny to read, full of wisdom and most of all an extremely powerful tool to help you succeed with taugh negotiatiors."
2,Disappointing,"An awful lot of words to make a few key points. Lots of story telling and rambling. Good points are in there, just a lot of pages between them."
4,Good primer on negotiation,"This book is a very readable and helpful overview of negotiation tactics. The author punctuates the points he makes with episodes from his own life, rendered with a reliably cornry sense of humor. In the course of doing so, he also touches on international relations and the game of life. Recommended for refreshing negotiation expertise or getting started in the field."
1,Smiling for the /r/ sound???,"Not so sure I want to teach my child to smile all the time to produce the /r/ sound...I myself do not produce an /r/ sound smiling. I was told in order to produce an American retroflex /r/ sound your lips must be forwarded and round , but in this book, the author wants you to avoid using this method. Instead, she wants you to smile to produce the /r/ sound. Most sxperts I see on Youtube.com produce the American retroflex /r/ by lips forwarded and slightly rounded. Here are some links below showing this method:(...)(...)(...)"
5,Great Plate Holders,"I didn't want to put holes in my walls to display a collection of owl plates my deceased mother had collected over many years. So I bought these plate holders and they work perfectly for what I wanted to do, which was display them in a lit china cabinet. Looks beautiful and a great tribute to my mother."
1,never buy from this company,I had the worst experience wiuth this company. They were telling me something diferent every time I called them to see why my watch was not sent. Until one off there employes told me that they were holding them because the price was going up. This is an irresposible copmpany. I cancel the order. I hope that amazon checks better companies to work with
3,da bird,this toy is fun except it spins around and gets all tangled.also the end comes off easily.otherwise the cats love it.get replacement ends right away.
4,Essential.,"This is a great compilaton showcasng the consistancy and at the same time showing off all their strongest points (songwriting, muscianship, power and melody). The live version of ""Over My Head"" blows away the studio version. The three unrealeased songs on here are solid. If you don't know which of their other CD's to buy or don't want to by them all, this is the one to have."
3,If this is the best... I'd hate to hear the worst !,"First off, let me say, I like King's X. They're a great band.I seen them in concert two years ago, when they opened for Joe Satriani and Dream Theater. Ty celebrated his 45th birthday that night(in Cleveland). They sounded tight as a band, and I liked what I heard. But, this album isn't all that good. I like ""Goldilox"", ""Summerland"", and ""Dogman"". Those are the songs that I actually bought the album for. The rest is decent, but hardly the best. This is a good album for any King's X fan. But, listen before you buy."
2,THIS MAKES ME SO-OOOOO Mad!!!,"This would be a great compilation, but they chose to include the live version of ""Over My Head"" instead of the studio version. WHY?!!! The live version stinks. And ""Over My Head"" is a fan favorite. It's probabaly the first song most of us ever head by King's X....because Atlantic sure didn't do much to promote ""Out Of The Silent Planet""! Nope...we had to wait until Headbanger's Ball brought King's X to our collective attention. The STUDIO version of ""Over My Head"" is a powerful piece of work. And they deliberately replaced it with the weaker live cut. Again, WHY?!! Because the record companies are so busy tryig to be in tune with TRENDS, that the are totally out of touch with the FANS! If they really wanted to make a good compilation they would have given us studio versions of the hits, and given us better live cuts like ""Manic Depression"" From Dogman. Screw these record company buttheads."
5,Consummate Collection for Any Rock Fan,"Showcasing 10 years of power and beauty on one CD, you get your money's worth and then some with 73 minutes of genuinely fantastic music. This compilation of ""hits"" (remarkably, King's X has not had any major hits that your average AOR radio listener can name - I think a byproduct of poor record label marketing) spans the range of sounds King's X is capable of - heavy power rock, slower ballads, great vocals and harmonies, killer bass and guitar riffs. The disc displays the enormous talents, both individually and collectively, of this tight threesome. For me, having seen and felt the power they deliver in a live performance on several occasions, the highlight of the CD is Over My Head, in which Doug describes his upbringing in a way that really makes you believe (not to mention, the bass and guitar work here is awesome). People, buy this disk, share it with your friends, and put out the word that King's X is one of the premiere rock bands of this era."
3,Excellent product,I've used this product in the past and it is a good product.Was glad to find it on line.
2,Overall Terribly Designed and Laid Out Book,"This book has a lot of information and can be useful to an intermediate programmer but for a CS1 course book, NO. Don't buy this book. It is certainly not a good book to use for a beginnier or a CS1 student. Topics are here and there. They are so badly organized and sometimes there are many unclear statements."
1,Absolutely the worst text book I have ever used,"If you are looking for a resource to help you learn object oriented c++ on your own, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! Author uses interchangeable terms for particular items without first telling you the terms are interchangeable which leaves you wondering weather you have lost your mind. Author constantly references things in chapters further ahead or explains ""how"" to do something AFTER a project is assigned requiring knowledge of the particular skill that has not been shared. If it were not for a friend (programmer by trade) pointing out the inconsistencies and out of order structure of this book I would never have made any progress in learning object oriented C++ using this book."
2,Poor book!,"This book is terrible in quite a few ways. I know C and C++ (ANSI/ISO C89, C++98) rather well, and this book (which is intended as an introductory read) confused me! I was forced to use this book as my only tutorial/reference/hope in a C++ course I took when I attended college.Mr. Mercer's coding style is ancient and belongs next to the first source release of the *NIX game Rogue. His code is more of an aesthetic problem (for me at least) than anything else though.The orange-highlighted sections(which there are a profound amount of) are an eyesore.If your professor/instructor pushes this bland book on you, take the course somewhere else where the department has a pinch of better taste.If this is a personal read, it's always best to start with Stroustrup, and if needed, a beginning book along the lines of possibly Learn in 21 Days series."
1,Piece of junk!,"If I could give it a 0, I would. Doesn't hold a charge for more than 24 hours, sometimes less! A friend of mine has the same phone and exact same problem. Don't bother trying to save your battery life by turning it off. Nope! Turn it off with half a bar, turn it back on beeping because the stupid think is LOW to NO BAR! Reception is great for me, but what good is that if the thing is dead most of the time? Are you trying to conduct any kind of business? Do you need a cell phone to make phone calls? Well... this may not be the phone for you. Contract. Contract. Contract. Don't do it. BIG mistake... I can go on, but I won't. Piece of junk!"
5,Great Phone.,I liked this phone it seems to be tough and stylish. But had ordered it off of Nextels site. They even gave me a code that saved me $50.00. Here it is for you all to share (CL897L) case sensitive. On the shopping cart page in the promo box. It is like an invoice thing. But I think it is a very good phone. You will enjoy the phone. Happy shopping.
4,Seems to do what it says,I started taking this product about a week ago along with a raw Maca powder product.I take the product prior to my morning exercise routine and again mid afternoon.It seemed that after about 48 hours I began to notice an increase in my libido and overall energy levels.I would definitely recommend trying this product out especially if you are currently using any ED drugs as the Maca really seems to increase the effectiveness.
2,Wrong language,I received the right book but in the wrong language. I talked to the seller and they agreed to a refund but they did not have the correct language in stock in order to exchange the book. Due to the price of the book it's not convenient to return it so I decided to keep it but I don't think I'll buy from them again.
1,Poor design,"I have the DR-80 rack and these are the clamps that are made for that rack,so they should fit right? Well sort of...I just bought a couple since they are cheaper than the others and I found out why they are not used much.They are too tight. I had to use a hammer to slide it on.They also are poorly designed compared to the other clamps that fit this rack (The PC-50, PCX-100 and PCX-200 all fit and I use them all without any problems). My advice is to spend the extra five to ten bucks for the better clamps."
3,"Camping for Under $12, ONLY FOR SENIORS!","Let me first say that I bought the east and west versions of these books to offer up solutions for an entire cross country 5000 mile off road motorcycle adventure known as the trans am trail. I didn't buy this to be frugal and get free camping everywhere I plan to stay, but the book is a bit misleading. Saying that Free or UNDER $12.00 is a bit much. Sure there are free campgrounds, but the Under $12.00 usually only applies to Senior Citizens for the majority of the sites I reviewed in the both books. Maybe a more fitting title would be ""Camping for Seniors - Free or under $12"".It does offer a wealth of information that would be hard to access on the move without access to the Internet is the reason I am giving it three stars and not one."
3,camping books,"books were not as good as hoped for. Found it hard to find campground unless you knew what town they were in. Many sounded good until you come to part of military only,or other big restrictions."
3,Straps across were too tight!,"I normally wear a 7.5 and these were perfect in the length and even the strap behind the ankle but the straps that go across your toes was just too tight. I'm a medium width but these shoes were just too pointy and tight in the toes for me :( They are so pretty and well made, just not for me. Glad returns are easy."
4,Jackson's first album on Capitol -- a hillbilly sizzler!,This 1958 album is a great mix of for-real rural-rooted country music and first-generation rockabilly. Jackson is just such a great singer! The half-dozen country-oriented bonus tracks make this reissue even that much sweeter. Recommended!
2,Not .Net,This is a regurgetation of C++ and MFC. .NET and managed C++ are only briefly addressed. There are better books.
5,CodeGuru to the rescue!!,"I bought this book expecting the best as Tom Archer is an original CodeGuru founder and I was definitely not disappointed. As another reviewer noted the ATL and COM chapters are worth the price of the book by themselves. Add to that, Archer's unparralled database chapters and some great content on DLLs, custom drawn controls, dialogs, document/view, etc. etc. and you hdefinitely have a great book."
4,"Easy to use, but . . .","This product is very easy to use, even the first time (doesn't scratch photopaper like the pencils tend to). The down fall is this set has a very limited number of colors which are difficult to mix to make the missing colors."
3,boat ladder,"a little more flimsy than I expected, seems that the plastic steps bend to a nearly breaking point but haven't so far. (I'm only 180 lbs) One of those get what you pay for."
3,Excellent book except...,"As a new executive in the Technical Support leadership role,transitioning from an R&D executive role, I found this book very helpful for the ""on-boarding"" process. The concise description of the key elements of the job allowed me to map first projects and outline key milestones. Unfortunately, as a Kindle version of the work, all four figures in the book were simply black boxes! Disappointing!"
5,Great Story,"I have been a fan of fantasy novels for many years and have read a great many of them. Therefore, I was pleased to find a fantasy series taken from a Christian perspective. Beyond the Summerland takes you into a world of dragons, giants, maidens, and valor. Graham has created the whole world from a Christian worldview which cannot be missed by those familiar with it.Overall I would say that the story itself is not that creative. By that I mean that the general plotline is rather linear and flows how one would expect. What makes this story stand out is the intense amount of character development. By the time I was finished with this book I truly cared about the characters in the story. They are genuine without being vulgar (as some stories insist upon for ""realism"") and they are fully three-dimensional with doubts, flaws, feelings, and courage.This is a great story for adults and youth alike and makes for a great springboard to discussing the things of God."
2,interesting at times but lacking somehow,"I've not studied writing in academia - I may be unqualified to write this - but despite some interesting points in the story I found the plot thin and underdeveloped, as were the characters. Everything seems to happen so simply and quickly that I never found much of it believable, nor could I get into the story emotionally.The basic ideas behind the story are interesting, but the actual implementation is somehow lacking (to me). There is seemingly very little build-up. Major events just up and happen. A potentially interesting story never really grew into what it could have been, I think.You can see many of the story's events coming as you progress through the book. Perhaps this book is more geared for younger folk.Considering what I spent on this book I found little return."
2,I wasted my time,"I bought this book based on the raving reviews. Usually that many sci-fi lovers aren't wrong. THEY ARE THIS TIME. The beginning of the book is mediocre. There is nothing special about Mr. Graham's writing style. The plot in the middle of the book grabs your attention. It kept me reading to see if I would love the end so much, I would decide to keep the book. Well, I HATED the end. It was much worse than the beginning. Even if Mr. Graham redeems himself in the second book of the series, I probably won't be reading it. It's a shame. The story is...interesting at least. But, unfortunately, it's also one I can leave and never pick up again."
4,Good first book,"Very strong first book from new author. Character development is good, and gets much better in sequel. Very surprising ending. Good read overall."
4,Good story but disappointing ending,"Beyond the summerland was an interesting book.I enjoyed reading most of it .However,the ending really retracted from the rest of the book. If you are looking for a feel good book with a happy ending do not go beyond the summerland."
1,Disappointment,"It usually takes an author 3 books to complete a series. This one is 5 books and the last one isn't even out yet. Wait to buy until all 5 are done because the first one leaves you dangling and the the next 3 are cliff hangers. I guess the author has learned well from Terry Brooks. This one to me could easily have been completed in 3 books.In general I don't like books that don't end. I paid good money to get innvolved in the story. I invested my free time to read it. Then when I come to the end that is no end, I feel as if I have been cheated. Karen Hancock does it better."
2,Beyond the Summerland,"In the traditon of all epic fantasies, Joraiem is sent on a quest to stop an unspeakable evil, Malek, from returning to their world for the third time and conquering it. Leaving behind his loved ones and cutting short his own dreams, the young man will encounter a series of companions who will help him achieve this goal, but at great cost. Throughout the narrative, he and the other heroes draw strength from the teachings of the All Father, and that is often their only comfort.** The great potential promised in this book, frankly fizzles. Flat characters and tired dialouge simply fail to live up to the grand message they surround. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
5,Most balanced & comprehensive biography on Mdme. Eva's life,"This is a very good book, considering that it was originally written in Spanish. Artistically written, yet very informative, it gives the reader a deeper look on this enigmatic figure's life. It gives us the details not only on Senora Eva's life but also on the society of Buenos Aires and Argentina before the Dirty War. I reccommend reading Ortiz's book with "" Santa Evita "" by Tomas Eloy Martinez."
1,Missed opportunity,"This was an extremely disappointing read. The story has such potential, but the writer is over her head, unskilled in even the most basic rules of sentence and paragraph construction. In addition, she has trouble expressing her point of view (nothing wrong with having one, but her writing reveals deep ambivalence rather than clarity of tone)."
3,loses something in translation,"In English, this book often reads more like a romance novel than like a serious biography; I do not know whether it reads that way in the original language. It seems more like a work of poetry than a work of prose- not as many cold hard facts as I would have expected from a biography, but some vivid character portraits. Eva Peron comes across as a kind of overgrown child, alternatively desperate to be somebody, do good, and fulfill her whimsical desires for elegance and ego gratification. Her husband comes across as a cold fish, someone who would never have risen to the top in a bigger country with a larger talent pool."
2,A difficult read,"If you want to skim for info, this might be OK, but overall I found it to be confusing. Perhaps too much information and minutia is presented... presenting one side, then another side. This is not ancient history so it is surprising that there is no clear, well connected story line. Unless you are desperate to get some information on Argentina, I would certainly try another version of her biography."
2,I.M.,"When a young nurse is accosted by a man needing blood late one night, a series of events is set in motion that years later, her daughter will not be able to stop. That daugher, Lily, grows up with a constant yearning for love that she only finds on the internet. Her ideal man seems to be a guy who calls himself Batt, and he has a lock on her soul that not even her closest friends can break. Batt is a vampire that her own mother created, and now that he's entered Lily's world; he is hungry.Fans of happy endings need not apply here. Inconsistent characterization and a rather depressing ending detract from the potential interest in this book."
4,Internet Message,"I've always hated knowing that the good guys are going to prevail, and that the bad guys always get what's coming. I rooted for the machines in the Terminator movies. So I was pleasantly surprised to find a twist on that old formula when I read Internet Message. Our heroine is not saved, as we suspect she will be. Lilly is the token innocent, virgin, reluctant victim, and we are sure she will transform into reluctant hero. Instead, to my surprise and delight, she transformed into a nasty blood sucking mistress, as powerful in her badness as she was shimmering in her goodness. These characters are fun to read, but what makes Internet Message stay with you is the unique spin Woods puts on it; the nice guy does NOT get the girl, the ultimate heroes are not who we think they will be, and there is no sentimentality sparing the lives and undeaths of our main characters. In vampire transformations, Woods left barely a soldier standing, and it was good, unclean fun."
5,It really woke me up.,I'm a young girl who loves Cynthia's books and when I saw that one I just had to have it. I felt so bad for Mina when I realized(before she did)how the girls were treating her. I wanted to jump through the book and beat some sense into those three preppy dancers. Then when she started having a crush on the summer preacher I felt better knowing that she didn't remain crushed for life.
5,Come a Stranger,Cynthia Voigt really makes this book come alive and you come to know the characters very well. I would recomend this book to everybody
1,Absolutely Awful,"This is one of the worst excuses for a film I have ever seen. What is seen is not acting - I doubt that any of the ""actors"" has ever been in an acting class - it is so bad it is not even funny. The end of the film is a band playing at a school prom that goes on forever with a piece that is not even musical. One of the characters wears glasses and is continually pushing them up on his nose until it is so irritating that you want to super glue them to this face to make him stop.The pacing of the film is so slow that it seems to be filmed in slow motion. Scenes that should take one minute go on for 5.A child with a camcorder in the back yard would make a better and more enjoyable film.Even if someone gives you this thing for free, AVOID IT."
1,The movie sucked but the behind the scene feature is great!,"First off don't buy the film, but if you have a chance to rent the DVD do so because there is a great behind the scene feature about the making of the ""zombie dog"". Its defiantly worth the watch."
1,bad !,"Poorly written, BAD acting, confused storyline. This, basically, has no redeeming features other than that the gory parts aren't particularly gory."
2,so bad it's horribly funny.,"This movie was so bad we had to pause it while we laughed hysterically at the bad acting, script, etc..don't believe me, then look at this quote..""Yeah, let's slap some peanut butter on this jam.""/:-\..riiiight."
3,Zombie Dog Was great to See,"This is a campy type of movie. The acting is not that great, but the movie was ok. The DVD shows some behind-the-scenes making of a prop that wasn't used much during the movie called the zombie dog. It was amazing all that went into making this prop and then due to time constraints, the prop was barely used."
3,Not A Review But A Warning For PSP Slim Owners,"This isn't a review because I never opened the product and tried it out. I just wanted to let fellow psp slim and lite owners that this product is not compatible with their psp's. When I purchased this product the product description didn't note this (hopefully they'll update this problem). As far as I can tell this is a very good product for phat owners so hopefully Joytech will make one for the slim.Oh and the star rating is there because you need a rating in order to print a review and I didn't want to bury it with a one star rating or overpraise with 5 stars since I never really tried it, it so I went in the middle."
4,Nice Speaker and Charging Stand for PSP 1000,"Read the title, its for the PSP 1000. Make sure you have that version, and this will be a good buy for just $10.I bought this last year, and it comes in really handy. There is not a power cord with the unit, but what you do is use the charging cord you have with the PSP and plug it into the Media Amp. It will charge the PSP while its on the Amp whether you are using it or not.Its nice to have while watching a movie from the PSP when sitting somewhere. I use it while working on projects at the desk. It is not tilted back at all, so it works best at eye or close to eye level. There is no option to tilt, which would have made this really nice.The remote for it works well, no issues at all with that. Just dont loose it. :)The speakers are loud enough and not crackly or too tinny. Its cheap, so you get what you pay for, but its not bad. I just use the headphone jack(s) on the back to listen anyways so its not an issue."
1,Not very good.,"I'm not sure why, but these wicks do not compare to ones I have purchased in the past. They do not wick up the water which results in nothing but more dry air blowing out of my ""humidifier."""
3,Needs a better humidistat,There was no happy medium set point and it ran either all the time or stayed off when it should have ran. I am using this machine in a finished basement music room to keep my guitars from drying out and getting damaged in the winter and appearance was not critical. I hotrodded the unit with a Honeywell humidistat that I got from work (I'm an hvac guy) and it works like a charm. This control has a list price of about $75. The control is mounted crooked on the front of the unit and looks very awkward but the unit now keeps the room in the mid 40 per cent.
5,BRILLIANT,"Perfection in every note, melody so beautiful it hurts, listening to it over and over for years now, perfection never gets old."
5,The name of this CD doesn't even begin to describe it,"A hypnotic mix of jazz, new age and flamenco sounds, this CD is both incredibly relaxing and intoxicating. Excellent back ground music for a massage!"
5,All b-tribe's music is excellent!,"This older album is one of the greatest of all b-tribe albums, I think. You'd have to be an ididot not to appreciate the sophistication and elegance of this incredibly talented group. Their raw tribal beat is pure magic! I think Shamanik, the only reviewer to give b-tribe a bad review needs a lesson in sophisticated music."
5,The title says it all!,The most sensual CD I've ever heard.....Put this b-tribe on and you and your lover will melt into one!
2,The tune Sometimes is not the same as heard on radio.Why?,I bought the CD because of the tune Sometimes. My disappointment is due to enhancements on the CD that I hadn't heard when listening to this tune on radio. Is there a reason for this?
1,Repetative and boring,"I had another B-tribe CD ""Spiritual Spiritual"" and thought highly of it. When i listened to this new one, i was unplesantly surprised. It lacks originality to the point of shamful! It is almost depressing. I agree with the customers who suggested not using it while driving--you Will fall asleep.Spanish vicals would be ok for someone who never heard Gypsy Kings. I recommend them instead!"
1,A sequence of unpleasant noise.,"Probably, most un-artisitic music I have ever heard.Lack of imagination and creativity. Just a some trivialtricks of digital music. Very annoying.If you are a music lover, and especially, if you arelooking for some creative music, this is not for you.Very untasteful. Yuck."
3,Cool Manga Series,I thought this was a cool Anime Series....but lacking a bit since I saw the DVD's first. But then I read the manga and it all made sense...I don't know why they even made the DVD's. This is so much better. I bought all the MAngas after the first one....I am eagerly awaiting Vol 7....YAY!!
4,"decent sound, well made","I bought this item to keep in a bag of small percussion gadgets to hand out during social gatherings so the non musicians in the room would have something to play with and feel included.The sound is actually decent, tough the 'mallet' isn't super heavy duty. Granted this item is made for kids, not really designed for adults who are enjoying themselves with fermented drinks.All in all, if we had kids, I'd get it for them. As a party favor, it is also excellent."
5,Once again a great work out!,OUCH!!! This is such a great work out. Cindy is inspirational. You must burn a ton of calories doing this work out. Dynamic Strength is very challenging to any advanced exerciser. Tracie Long and team have really created such a great product for all of us.
3,Grandkids,Already recieved this as a gift so had to return this product. Was unable to try out here at grandma's house.
5,Bruno-Faria reviews,"It is a very important book because the theme ""creativity in groups"" is essential in the organizational context and there is a single in the area. Moreover, the book brings differents approaches about the subject."
2,Less than expected,"I enjoyed seeing the different plans and found some that might work for our family. I did not think the book was worth anywhere near the price charged, for there was really only 40 different plans, NOT 80 as noted in the book description. The book was 40 plans which were simply flip-flopped or reversed on the opposite page. I don't like mis-representation therefore I do not reccommend this book, unless you can find a used one."
4,Great for small families,"I first bought the previous pot, which required 3 hours and lots of shortening to season; it ended up greasy so I rushed to replace it when this pot came out. I down graded this Dutch oven because the handle just gets in the way; I had my husband remove it with a cutting tool. Also, I suspect the lid does not fit very tightly. I had really wanted a Dutch oven this size; small in cookware is hard to find. So far I have made beef burgundy twice, and it was delicious. Just so you know how much the pan holds, slightly less than 1 pound of stew meat with 1 1/8 cups liquid are the maximum for it. The recipe required that I brown the meat and heat the liquid on the stove top; in less than 3 hours of oven time, the stew meat was tender and getting crusty because all the liquid was gone; just wine dregs and a little fat remained."
3,Seasoned Cast Iron Dutch Oven not very well Seasoned,"The Cajun Cookware 1 quart seasoned cast iron Dutch Oven is exactly the size I needed, but I do question the term ""seasoned"" somewhat. The first thing I put into the pot was plain water, which I boiled, and the pot rusted slightly above the water line. From experience, I know that this can be corrected fairly easily, but I am disapointed with the product in this respect. Also, the interior of the pot is a little ""rough"" when compared to Lodgeware, and looked just a tad unfinished. It arrived with no papers, but I do know that it's made in China. Since I only use this pot for non-edibles, I'm OK, but would want more information before cooking food in it."
4,murder is only a game on tv,"Was it murder, or a series of highly coincidental accidents that took the lives of so many celebrities connected to the TV show, ""The Murder Game""? Steve Allen and his real life wife must solve the mystery before they become victims as well. The book was very enjoyable, yet unbelievable. First off, I find it impossible to believe the LAPD wouldn't latch onto the accidents with suspicion sooner. Second, I could not believe the killer, who was so careful throughout the story would betray their identity in the final dramatic scene. Finally, Steve and Jayne's escape from death was a bit too difficult to swallow, especially with such a shallow explanation offered after the fact. Nevertheless, Mr Allen writes murder mysteries in the style of an old fashioned gentleman, which makes them a joy to read. Whatever happened to wit and manners?"
4,"Simple, yet informative","I was pleasingly surprised at how simple this procedure was to do. Although I am not trained, I was able to perfect what little I did know how to do. I have been doing my daughter's hair for a little while but would always get stuck at the top of the head. This DVD help alot. I just redid her hair and it looks fabulous!!!!"
2,Hmmmmmmmmmm very basic sorry Marquetta,"This video lacked time to show more techniques and it was very basic like in the old days or old school weave, sorry will buy your other vids especially micro braids and kinky twists."
2,Learn how to do A weave (literally),"The product was decent, I did get an idea of how to do a weave but the downfall to the product is that its only one hairstyle your learning so it really doesnt give you a broad idea. Its definitly not worth the money listed your probably better off getting the whole package that she has because atleast then you would be getting your moneys worth."
2,Not made for large bust sizes,"I purchased this swim dress in size 16, and I have a large bust (D-DD). The suit fit well except for the bust, which was overflowing. It also arrived without any shipping label or any information. I am trying to exchange it, but I have doubts about that working out from other reviews."
4,B-24 Liberator Units of the Fifteenth Air Force.,"I got this book for my 86 year old father who was a waist gunner on a B-24 out of Torretta Field near Cerignola Italy in 1944. He enjoyed it a lot and still looks at the pictures now and then. While it covers a bunch of the missions of the 15th Air Force, it would take a much larger volume to cover it all. The photos are what really make it enjoyable."
5,WW2,"this i purchased for an 88 year old neighbor who during ww2 flew B24 airplanes. He is a darling retired pilot with alot of stories to tell. This is his xmas present, and he will love it!! I'll add more after he has seen it!"
2,Not helpful in a study,"If you are looking to study more about Isaiah 40:31 or about eagles, this book is not the one you are looking for. If you want a good novel to read, you might consider this book. I was looking to study more about eagles and relating it to Isaiah 40:31. I was certainly disappointed with this book."
3,"""Great""","Unfortunatly this CD has not yet been released in the USA. The albums first release ""Off The Hook"" is indeed clasic Jody Watley. The song has a nice midtempo groove to it. Miss Watley demostrates great style and finesse on her vocals. Hopefully soon we will all be able to enjoy the grammy award wining artist once again. Miss Watley is truly one of our ""Divas"""
4,"Not her best work, but enjoyable.","Since this CD is not available in the states, I was very excited to see it in a store in Canada. I put it in, and was amazed at how different a sound this is for her. The first 4 or 5 tracks are very funky and are also my favorite tracks. As the album progresses, the later songs are a little over-produced and ho-hum. I did find 16 a good song, tho. My favorites are ""Flower"" and ""Everything You Do""."
4,"Good, understandable and practice guide",There are not many books on evaluating of IT costs and benefits. Especially when you like a certain amount of quantification and practice advice. The text proposes various methods how to evaluate IT investment (not only on money basis). On first look it looks as valuable material however I will can confirm this opinion after possible (I hope) application.
5,Nice job,"Product performs well, great expansion. I think the other reviewers are assuming the product is something it isn't. There is a difference between a firestop and a fireblock."
5,Rookie Reader,Montessori directors -- this book and others in the series are a great addition to your geography work! They are easy to read and understand. Good for primary classrooms and lower elementary classrooms.
2,Book Not So Good,I was referred to this book for price and identification and was sadly disappointed to get the book and look up the china I had to find that it had some of the pieces and history but by NO MEANS is a complete guide. The China Company I had was in there but it didn't have the history from the year the company started but it did have the identification stamps from the year the company started go figure. The price guide consisted of showing a few pictures of china this particular company producted and gave a few prices. I couldn't believe it. The only reason I kept this book is because I was so busy I didn't get to return it before the 30 day return was over. Oh well I'll know better next time.
5,Great flavor for hard candy,"I was visiting Japan and stayed at an ANA hotel (in Nagoya). At the registration counter, they had ANA branded hard candies. They were delicious. I noted the name Senjaku on them. I came home to the states and searched Amazon and what do I find? These hard candies (and some other fizzy ones too). I ordered three bags of these and one each of the other kind. All arrived promptly. These hard candies taste great. While they may not be identical to the ANA ones, they are quite good. They are like Jolly Ranchers in consistency and duration but different flavors. I like them and recommend them. The fizzy ones reminded me of Zotz (from Italy). Another check of Amazon and two boxes of Zotz headed my way (smile). By the way, as far as I can tell, there is NOTHING sweet potato about these hard candy."
3,Borodin...,I did enjoy this disc. I got it at a bargain price to boot! Classical music with real musicians showing us their skills. My only complaint is that I wished that the recording was of better quality! Five stars for the music - Three stars for the disc!
3,An Okay Buy - Not Spectacular,"This CD wasn't as good as I anticipated. It had what I wanted on it, but not much more. I'm glad that I bought it, but I wasn't blown away by it."
2,Wooden corbel,"Ordered a set of this corbel because the pics is nice online. But when I opened the box, I was some kind of disappointed. It is not as nice as it shows in the web site. The carving job is not that nice. I believe you can find a much better item in Amazon. I am going to return them."
2,There's better...,"This recording just doesn't do it for me. Stravinsky's Rite of Spring is such an emotional ride because of it's strong rhythmic qualities. The first time you hear it done right, you feel wrong. It's freakishly piercing at a primal level, which would explain why its the most famous piece of Primitivism. Those qualities are dumbed down to a measure that makes the piece seem more annoying than involving. This recording gets its 2 stars instead of what would be one because I cannot be too hard on the Firebird Suite, as this is the first I've heard it."
2,Sleepy,"This book was sooo boring. There's is no metion of any of the old characters.I can't believe Bryan would leave Nina,that's to unrealistic.Jessica is all intent on being good,but that's not her personality.Liz and Sam arguing all the time is annoying.I don't really like Chloe she seems really spoilt,it was really stupid when she made up that Tom Watts was her boyfriend.I can't believe Tom is giving up everything he worked for to be back on the football team.I think Francine Pascal/Laurie John should write a third Lifeguard mini-series."
2,"Fun, But So-So Writing","I remember enjoying the Encyclopedia Brown solve-them-yourself mysteries when I was a kid. But as an adult, I'd prefer to see kids reading something with a little more writing quality. No characterizations, no drama, cliche descriptions -- couldn't someone do this genre better?"
2,OK except that it smells terrible,"I bought this drum for someone else in the household, who loves playing it. Otherwise, I'd give it away or even throw it away, because after several months it still smells terrible. At first I thought it was just out-gassing and that the smell would go away -- but it hasn't. It still has that awful ""made in China"" odor that some things have. It smells toxic, really bad. As soon as I can replace it with one I can buy from a store (and smell first) I will. Meanwhile, I don't recommend it unless you're willing to return it right away if you get one that smells bad."
5,Absolutely phenomenal tool!!!,"Used to make holes in my belts...hole punches in all different sizes, quick & easy, everything i could ask for. Would recommend to anyone in a heartbeat!!!"
3,not big enough,"the largest punch size was not big enough to punch a hole in the stirrups. a little disappointed because of that, otherwise the quality was okay."
4,Drawing the dinos is great,"This book is simple, even for the non-artistic type child. The finished product of the dino drawing looks great."
2,"Not too bad, but serious candidates can do better.","If you're interested in law enforcement, but don't have the slightest idea where to start, you might get something out of this book. If you've taken any criminal justice or law enforcement classes, however, skip this one and pick up a book that isn't so elementary. The best book ever written on federal law enforcement positions is ""Guide to Careers in Federal Law Enforcement,"" by Thomas H. Ackerman. Your chances of getting a job in federal law enforcement will increase substantially if you have the information presented in Ackerman's book. Those who want to be municipal cops should consider ""Police Officer,"" by Hugh O'Neil. Although O'Neil's book is quite basic, there is some good information about getting into police departments."
4,Great place to start for information,"If you haven't done any research in this career field it is well worth it. However, most is basic information. But it is a great gift for a young person interested in crime fighting or for anyone just starting the search for that certain job in this field."
1,WRONG MOVIE,The DVD that is being released here is matched with the wrong description. This is not the 2006 Covenant that was released in September. That has yet to be announced.
1,Horrid,Made me want to just throw out the movie. It was like a really bad version of the Devil's Advocate!
1,I've seen high school students,"Make better movies than this. I thought I was renting the other movie entitled the covenant. I was wrong. The entire span of the movie, I had my friend telling me it was the worst movie he had ever seen. He wasn't lying. Most parts of the movie, were completely pointless. The whole movie made no sense. The only entertainment I got out of this movie, was laughing at how bad it was. At one point, a cane propels itself through the air and stabs a man in the chest.I recomend that everyone watch this movie. And by everybody, I mean nobody."
2,Weak Facts,"Well I have a little first hand knowledge regarding A man named Edward Van Antwerp in this book. The author implies he is somehow involved in a conspiracy. I'm sure the author knew better. Edward Van Antwerp was my brother-in-law and nothing could be further from the truth. He was nothing more than a pathetic, drunken loser that was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He had been thrown from his family home and by some terrible....really terrible luck, he ended up rooming in a flop house with Sirhan. He was more concerned to learn Sirhan was Homosexual than an assasin."
1,Why not ?,"I can not watch instant video ' cause I live in Mexico City. I do have credit and debit cards from U.S.A. and that works find with APPLE (USA). With them I can buy, rent videos, movies, TV shows you name it.....To bad with Amazon, they don't want to make business, so I guess I will spend my money with APPLE...Merry 'Xmas !!!"
5,Love it!,One of my absolute favorite shows! And I love that I can stream it on my computer. Hope there's more seasons to come.
4,Teach to the test?,"Provides a thorough explanation of curriculum alignment and makes the case that the written curriculum should be aligned with the tested and taught curriculum, a concept that seems obvious, but isn't utilized often enough in our schools. Great for teachers and essential for administrators."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"I could have written a better book myself. This book is nothing but sparse worthless advice that could have fit on one page but, is instead spread out to fit a terribly written book. full of worthless pictures, and double spaced type to fill the pages of this most uninspired ""book"".--"
1,Are you kidding me?,"I found this book vacuous and jejune. And frankly, I met the author (without knowing who he was) and he tried to pick me up, and I've never heard such a pile of cr.. in my life. And I'm not even close to beautiful. So good luck with his advise."
5,The Power Within,"As a master's level clinical psychology student, I appreciate this book on several levels. I was fairly unfamiliar with Buddhism before reading this book, in part because of the anticipated complexity of the subject. To my surprise, I discovered Atkins had written a book comprehensible to those new to Buddhism. For those with a knowledge of Buddhism already, it provides much more insight into the topic. The connections to psychology and therapy are too vast to detail. As a therapist, you are simply a faciliator for the client in his quest to learn more about himself, very similarly to Buddhism. Through sharing his experience, Atkins proves the great power we each obtain through our minds and faith in healing."
4,Great soothing exciting trip.,"Some of these tunes surprise me every time I listen to them. You can hum them in your mind. You can drive while listening hard -- try to pay attention to the road! Turn it up loud, then listen to it soft -- it will sound good both ways. Your dinner guests will ask what they are listening to, and you can recommend this disk, just as I recommend this to you."
2,Fair but uninspired,"I though this was only fair. The tone of the writing was very flat, and the book was heavily padded with generic ""inspirational"" quotes (about a fifth of the book's 130 pages) that did nothing to further my interest in this man's story. I much preferred ""Slow Fat Triathlete"" by Jayne Williams, which was much funnier, more informative and genuinely inspirational."
2,lacks supstance,"Was excited to receive the book, but a little dis-appointed after reading it. The book is a quick history of a person starting training and the participatin in some triathlons. It was good to know the story, but not a book if you are looking for solid training tips or motivation."
4,"There are other, better options","I was surprised to see that this set was still available. These transfers were made in the late 1970's at the dawn of the digital era and were state of the art for that time. But in cleaning up the surface noise these old digital transfers seriously flatten out the sound of Caruso's voice.I would suggest that people interested in Caruso check out the ""complete"" Caruso series on Naxos with new digital restorations by the great sound engineer/artist Ward Marston. On the Naxos CD's the voice is preserved in a much more natural and subtle sound while all of the other noises are eliminated as much as possible. It's much more satisfying and true to the original recordings than these old RCA transfers. If you're going to spend $130.00 you should have the best available. It's only fair to Caruso."
4,very inspirational and meaningful for children,This book is one of my daughters favorites. She loves when I read it to her. It is a lovely tale that teaches children about all the different people there are in the world. I only wish that it was not out of print so I could give my friends it for their children.
4,Good Christmas story,I have watched every year since it came out and I still like it just thought it was time to own it on DVD instead of just video.
2,grandkids didn't like it,"This DVD didn't hold the attention of my grandkids at all, maybe they were to young to enjoy it."
2,not touching,everybody i know said they were crying forever because this movie was so sad.to tell you the truth i didnt even see one sad part in this movie.i have the little novelization book with pictures from this and it is even better than the movie
5,Jack Frost,I am a big fan of Michael Keaton. This is an awesome movie that I really enjoy watching over and over.
5,Great !!!!!,"Great family christmas movie, bought all my kids a copy for their house now that they are grown and have their own places as we use to watch it as a family ever year."
5,classic Christmas Story,"I chose this video because it is a good family movie for children and families alike. Have added it to myseasonal must see movies. The story helps teach a child about loss, and letting go of their anger."
5,Great Fun Movie,"I thought this movie was really good. Michael Keaton, Joseph Cross & Kelly Preston did really a great job in this movie. Real good script. The snowman I thought was awesome. Great special effects. But, there were some sad parts in this movie. It is a movie for all ages! Did you know that the end title song by Hanson was also in the movie ""Twister""? It was in the (middle of movie) scene when Jo & Aunt Meg were talking upstairs in the bedroom & music was playing softly in the background. I just recently noticed this cause I have both ""Jack Frost"" & ""Twister"" & I like to listen to the music in movies. I just happened to notice this. Watch ""Twister"" when you get to that part of the movie I just mentioned, listen carefully to the song in the background. I thought I share this interesting tidbit. Email me at Jason216@webtv.net for any comments! Thanks!"
2,polled in the top ten for worst christmas movies.,"Ok, I love bad horror movies, but this is a horror in a different light. Michael Keaten in a movie that destroyed his career: stars as a man who dies and comes back as a snowman. HE doesn't melt even , it's just a bizaare movie. Actually I find santa claus to be a real horror pertetrated on children and this is even worse than a fat man who teaches kids that they deserve free gifts while usurping the true meaning of christmas. Still the effects were fine for the 90's. Which was the audience this was intended for , but it was a disaster. As A lover of bad b movies I can't even recommend this one. I like the other 'jack frost' better, in which a animated snowman hunts down people. Or the other version in which the lead character is a serial killer. Oh yeah, those are bad but they are better than this one."
2,Don't waste your time,"I'm just glad I saw this rubbish on HBO instead of paying good money to see it. The plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese. And the boy who played Charlie (Joseph Cross) is only a fair actor. (Where's Jonathan Taylor Thomas when you need him ! ) At least the Colorado scenery was good, but that's about the only positive thing I got from this movie."
3,Was not 'New' as reported,"The item will serve my purposes, but was not New as claimed. The DVD's cardboard cover was actually well worn, and the item was not sealed,as would be if were new."
2,Henry Rollins in a kids movie...,"henry rollins in a kids movie. I find this Pretty dumb and a bit dark if you ask me, I never really liked mike keaton anyways."
3,Jack Frost: Movie name officially overused,"A good family pick I guess( opposite from the horror movie with the same name )and I was forced into watching it. Boring. Michael Keaton does an okay job. All of the humor was physical, not anything very samrt for adults. Believe me, this would be far behind on my rental list, and I would nonrmally not choose to watch it. I just found myself in a room with a TV with this movie on it. This was longer than it should have been and very corny. I would totally trash it, but I really liked the ending. Dont get me wrong, I am not recomending it, but it did have a partially recovering ending."
2,My father is a snowman!,"Jack Frost is an unfunny children's movie based on the disturbing premise of a boy's dead father coming back to this world as a snowman. But wait! This premise exists only to put an anthropomorphic snowman onscreen - the rest of the movie is light slapstick about school bullies and snowfights. The intriguing theme of afterlife, reincarnation, and death is almost completely ignored throughout the film. Only goes to show that almost anything can be made into an insubstantial "" heartwarming family movie""."
1,Might be a bootleg copy,"I am not sure if this movie was originally recorded so dark it's hard to see, but I am thinking I may have a bootlegged copy. Not a bad movie for young viewers, but we had to watch in a completely dark room and still could barely see it."
1,I wanted to like it,"The movie is just too stupid to enjoy. I can usually suspend my disbelief but this was asking way too much. It would have played better as a comedy. Things I learned was snowmen don't have snowballs, they feel cold, and they can sneak into a hockey rink unnoticed."
5,Fun movie,Jack Frost is such a cute movie. Great movie for kids and adults. I just love christmas movies; this is a must have for your dvd collection.
4,A Great Holiday Film,"I like this holiday movie like always, and I like it when it plays on T.V every year towards Christmas and after Thanksgiving.Another great holiday film for the family"
5,GREAT!,"I loved this movie, and, it touched my heart also. I think the scenery was beautiful and it just makes you want to get cozy and sit in a big comfy chair in the middle of a snowstorm and watch it! I also thought Michael Keaton looked pretty good! That was a plus!"
4,The Product was exactly what i expected,"The product was exactly as it was advertised . It also arrived a day dearly, so that was a bonus."
3,cool,"Not my favorite movie but my family likes it. It wasnt horrible, just not my thing I guess.. But who am I to judge it?"
5,Adorable!,This is such a sweet movie! It is so cute and has a great cast. I am glad that I found this one!
3,good family feature,I bought this movie for my nephew Malachi telling a story about ehat it would be like to become a snowman
4,MOVIE,"A PRETTY GOOD CHRISTMAS TIME MOVIE. RELATING MORE TO WINTER TIME THAN CHRISTMAS, BUT ENTERTAINING. MICHAEL KEATON IS GOOD AS ALWAYS."
1,Horrid!,"If there was a -5 star rating option for this movie, that is how I would rate it! It is the worst movie that I have ever seen! It is even too stupid to be funny!"
5,a favorite,"Jack FrostHad to replace the old VHS we watched for years. This is one of our favorites, haven't grown tired of it and watch every year."
4,"Good Movie, kind of sad","If you're looking for a feel good Christmas movie, this falls just short. Its a good movie, well worth the watch, but rather sad. It ends well enough."
2,Good acting but the plot needs work,"Its cute and almost a good movie but there are too many gaps in the plot where you are left to wonder, ""wait, what? why would that happen right now?"
2,Who can afford such a program???,This book seems to contain some good information but who can a fford to spend the money to try it? Even if this prgram would work alot of people cannot do it because of the very high cost and if the program doesn`t work you have lost big $$$! This book promotes its own products and everyone elses products are no good according to this book.Is it right for a author to write a reveiw on his own book??
1,Wrong Premise,"Candida yeast overgrowth is just one of about 79 known toxins that are present in the blood and tissues of a person who is highly mycotic, researchers believe their are over 1000. To target just this one to destroy is foolish but lucrative. Claude Bernard, a French physiologist, Guenther Endelein, a German bacteriologist, and Antoine Bechamp, a French MD.,chemist, and pharmacologist all did work on chronic disease proving that all disease is mycosis and all illness is from incorrect nutrition. Gary Carlsen's book reflects the writings of a person with very incomplete information and poor education on the subject."
1,PROGRAM DID NOT WORK FOR ME!!!,I hope this program works for someone because it sure did not work for me. I would like to see the success rate statistics.No guarantees and no refunds with this program.
5,dream paints:),"these photo oils are so amazing! first i got them when i was developing prints in the darkroom, but now i use them on my polaroids and they look so dreamy! i wish i could put a photo example up here. they are super easy to use,,,,you just blend until you get the look you want. they honestly turn your photos into another worldso happy with the results!!!"
3,Pretty good.....,I did enjoyed this movie... Was good all the way till the end... Love Asian movies w/ martial arts anyway.....
4,over looked,"In the 90's while Faith Hill and Shania Twain was grabbing all the headlines Suzy Bogguss was quietly releasing quality music. This greatest hits collection is a gem. The nice thing about this collection is that you have not heard these songs on the radio a million times. Songs like Cross My Broken Heart and Diamond And Tears are great songs and should have been huge radio hits. Drive South, Aces,Outbound Plane and Just Like The Weather make this collection a must have. If you a country music fan and looking for something you may not be familar with this is really good cd that will not disapoint. Highly recommended."
4,Superb collection for very underrated country lady from Illinois!,"I have seen Suzy many times in concertand she is outstanding and has put outseven or eight very good to great LPs.This is one of them. Too bad my ratingscale only up to four stars (unlikethe very liberal amazon.com one)!Great job, Suzy!"
5,"If you love country, you'll love Suzy!",This CD has a little of everything from country to the blues. The yodeling on Cowboy's Sweetheart is awesome! I've seen Suzy live at our State Fair and she is a fantastic performer. You will not regret buying this CD! It's the next best thing to seeing her live!
1,NOT THE NORM MACDONALD MOVIE,"I hope that if you are ordering this movie you realize that despite the reviews that were posted on this page this is not the Norm Macdonald movie. If you look at the box art here and the director's name you can clerly see that it is a completely different movie. I'm sorry that a few morons listed reviews for the Norm Macdonald movie, which I am sure is a MUCH better film that this one."
5,I wet my pants laughing at this baby.,"Norm Macdonald and Artie Lang team up as a pair of witty revenger artists. Their ""revenge for hire business"" is the best idea since that one guy invented crack. also starring--jack warden as 100 year old POPS...Chevy Chase as unscrupulous Dr. Farthing...cameos by chris farley, adam sandler and gary coleman"
5,Balances centuries of tradition and faith with modern change,"The World Of Christ And the World Of Culture: Sacred And Secular Through The Theology Of Karl Barth by Paul Louis Metzger (Assistant Professor of Christian Theology and Theology of Culture, Multnomah Biblical Seminary, Portland, Oregon) is a close and illuminating study of Karl Barth's revolutionary theological ideals. From exploring the sacred in the creative word to ""theological politics"" to the demise of corpus christianum, The World of Christ and the World of Culture balances centuries of tradition and faith with modern changes in human way of life looking for a road that unifies faith in God with adaptations to the onward march of Time. The World Of Christ And The World Of Culture is a most welcome addition to Christian Theological Studies reading lists and library collections."
2,Violation!,"The CD-R-recordings sold by ArchivMusic, and that you may also be offered elsewhere, are acoustically very inferior to the original CDs.The sound is dull, lacking the for Mercury Living Presence normally clearly articulated, crispy sound. Whereas Mercury Living Presence recordings as you may hear then on normal CDs normally are distinguised by a very high technical quality, the CD-R-products are inferior in sound quality.If you can not at all hear any difference, just take a look at the sleeves and the inlets, and you will probably see what is reflected acoustically: You see pale, unclear pictures and letters.So: The CD-Rs represent violations of the concept articulatede by Mercury Living Presence consisting of recordings where the technical quality has high priority."
5,Great item for a Czech,"The charm,a gift for my sister, was a perfect addition to her charm bracelet. Didn't find anything like it anywhere else."
5,Must read for Beryl Markham readers,"I'm actually sorry I read this as a fan of Beryl Markham's ""West with the Night"". Still, I'm glad to know the facts behind the book."
1,Pick it up on remainder,A real waste of money. Looks like the book was slapped together in a couple of weeks.
2,"To each, their own","Before leaving for law school, I thought it was necessary to check out every ""surving your first year"" book on the market(By the way there are a million). After completing my first year, I have come to the conclusion that none of them give you a real picture of the first year. The suggestions offered by this book and many others may work for a discreet few but every law school experience is unique. It may be far more helpful to talk to other law students about thier first year. If you are considering law school, and feel you must buy something to calm your nerves, then this book is appropriate. However, because you are considering law school, my guess is you already know how to succeed."
5,Real Yoga for Real People,"Real Yoga for Real People can be done by anyone wishing to try it out for themselves.Simple, easy, and utilizing the breath. I liked that the focus was on the power of the breath."
2,This is not real yoga,"Unfortunately, this video provides neither real yoga nor real people.The practice of yoga is much more than the asanas. Grated, Mark Whitewell acknowledges this fact in the introduction; however the camera zeros in on young women with ballet training and leaves those with bodies representing 99.9% of human beings in the background. So, one again, the young and the beautiful are the stars and everyone else is just an extra in the movie of life.The movements are repetitive and limited. I was hoping for more of a variety of the thousands of asanas that are part of the physical aspect of yoga. I am glad that Mark emphasized the importance of pranyama; however, a section on pranyama and perhaps a section on the 8 limbs of yoga would have rounded out the bare bones of the DVD.To summarize: Both the models and the video need a bit more flesh on their bones."
5,Tag Heuer,A great watch for a great price plus the quick delivery meant I could enjoy wearing it sooner.
3,Great Quality,"The movie just wasn't as great as I remember as a child. There were parts that seemed to drag on. Don't know why, as a child, I thought this movie was so great. The Blue-ray quality was very good though."
2,Vastly overpriced,"This book contains only a few pages of instructions on how to build a gingerbread house, and many diagrams. It's being sold at over 300% the cover price, so I suggest a reader look elsewhere. Much mor euseful free information on the INternet."
4,from a sheep lover,"This is such a cute book to share with a toddler or infant. This is for my infant Grandson. It's never too soon to start them with books. This book has cute illustrations and a simple poem. I love collecting sheepie things. It would be cute for a collection, as well."
5,"Kempe, Dresden, and Strauss were made for each other.","This is a re-release, remastered (but I can't hear much change in the sound from earlier versions), of these wonderful recordings. They truly are great performances. Kempe and the Dresden Staatkapelle seemed to have a way with Strauss that never failed him. If you don't have earlier incarnations of these performances, this is your chance to grab them at a bargain price.This is, without doubt, my favorite recording of Ein Heldenleben, better than Karajan's, although I wouldn't want to be without it, either."
1,Skip all but the last track,I initially heard a single track on Sat Radio (happened to be the last track on this CD)and was impressed. I bought the entire CD based on all the glowing reviews here on Amazon. What were you all thinking? 90% of this CD is old covers that are done in a sappy and boring way.. In the future I'll never buy another CD unless all the tracks can be sampled. Mr. Adams needs to get back to Syncopated funk from his Tower of Power roots and stop trying to be a Rick Braun or Chris Botti.
4,Very surprised with myself and The Imposter,"First I must say, I am not a fan of Christian rock, I have never heard of his old band thats in the can. Yet this is music for everyone. He does borrow a bit from the well of other eastablished artists such as Bowie and Radiohead like everyone does yet he has so much to offer. This effort is more main stream rock than I would have wanted, yet on the first listen you will enjoy. On the second listen you will apperciate. On the third you will understand that he is doing what others wish they could do and he does it better. I am surprised at how much I like this when I don't like the middle of the dial top 40 stuff. Very suprised with myself. I didn't give it 5 stars because it needs more originality for such a distinction. Still strongly recommended for all."
1,A big mistake,Only works with the whole set and base station. Beware of sellers charging more for shipping than the cost of the remote handset.
1,Power charger bit the dust after 3 months,"Phone is fine, but the charger died and I now have to chase down another one. It shouldn't have done that after only 3 months of infrequent use."
4,Good phone with nice features; low battery life,"I bought the base station with two of these phones at Walmart, and my wife and I really like the phones so we bought two more phones to add to the system (the base supports 4 phones) It's nice to be able to use the phones as intercoms to talk throughout the house. Ability to listen to messages at any remote phone is a nice feature also. The display is easy to read, and you have a choice of a number of ringtones on each phone. The battery life is not great, though. The phones need a recharge after an hour of conversation."
1,Please do not buy this!,"This is the worse phone I've ever owned! I bought this to replace another bad phone but this one turned out to be even worse. People complain that they can't hear me even when I put it on ""Boost"" and lately it just turns off by itself in the middle of the conversation. I tried to contact Panasonic on-line but haven't heard from anybody yet - I guess I will have to call them to resolve this problem. Do not bother buying this item - it's not worth it."
5,manfred mann nightingales&bombers,"Have listened to this once a month for 25 years. One of my very favorites.If you like The ""MANN"". This is the one of their best.I am looking forward to adding this to my CD collection."
5,Magical World,"I grew up listening to Tomita's version of the Firebird Suite. Of course, the original composition is lovely, but something about Tomita's sense for choosing sounds has always transported me to another world while listening. As a child, this version stirred up my imagination. As an adult, I can still hear it, and still remember the places I visited, though I no longer own a copy of this recording. I am very disappointed that this recording is unavailable. I was hoping to raise my children to the sounds of Tomita's Firebird Suite. I guess I'll have to settle for Stravinsky!"
4,Rev. Michael Fram,"Of all the books that I have read about the current restoration of the ascension gifts of Christ, this one has a slightly different angle to it. It is a good book to enhance your view of where we are in God's timetable. Your understanding will be better rounded. Especially good is the author's analogy of the fivefold ministry and a railroad train's personnel. I highly recommend this book"
1,Just Plain Wrong,"I found this to be a skillfully worded twisting of biblical truth. In craftsman like fashion this distorted view can only serve to enrich its author. A masterful job of presenting a piece of fact here and a partial truth there which combine to form a slick, polished and very wrong set of conclusions. ""For every complex problem there is a solution that is obvious, simple and totally wrong"" This book is a shining example!"
1,deceitful,Dwayne Stone twists the word of god to suit his own agenda. This book is full of half-truths and lies. I believe anyone who buys into this teaching is not capable of thinking for themselves!
3,ceramic hair dryer,"it's a hair dryer, blows hot air....doesn't seem to dry my hair any faster, but is light enough so my arm doesn't start to hurt..."
1,Broken in 4 months,"This hair dryer is relatively light in weight and is reasonably quiet. It did dry my hair faster than a standard dryer. But from day one the power/electricity connection seemed touchy, almost turning off and back on until it had run a minute or two. Then it seemed that something had warmed up and expanded so that then it would run properly. But now it has died completely, after just four months of daily use. I would not recommend this hair dryer."
2,Andis 75330 Hair Dryer,"It is quiet - It does dry very well - And...after a couple of months of use it does shut down just before my hair is properly dried...grrrr...I have to let it cool down before it will work again. By then my hair is unhappy and so am I. It would make better engineering sense to properly match the thermal safety switch with the heating element and air flow. For the price I would recommend others to purchase a different dryer. The LCD display appears to be more of a marketing ""oooo"" factor than a useable information display."
